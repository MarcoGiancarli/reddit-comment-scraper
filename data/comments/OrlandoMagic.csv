OrlandoMagic,3e4vpc,bobbydigital_ftw,6,Tue Jul 21 23:47:58 2015 UTC,"I like Gordon off the bench as an energy guy, but still playing big-time minutes."
OrlandoMagic,3e4vpc,JawsOfDoom,4,Wed Jul 22 00:33:53 2015 UTC,AG is the best defender out of the group... I think it makes more sense to align his minutes with opposing starters.
OrlandoMagic,3e4vpc,REEB,5,Wed Jul 22 02:15:58 2015 UTC,"Would be between Mario and Harris.  Depending on when they hit their prime, it might be more a question of working out the contracts logically: For example, If Harris is under contract and the Mario is on the last year of his, offer Mario the starting gig to make retaining easier/less likely that he leaves for a starting role, and bring Harris off the bench.  Harris might not be happy about it, but he's under contract so there's not much he can do about it."
OrlandoMagic,3e4vpc,CaptainBananaFish,2,Tue Jul 21 23:56:48 2015 UTC,"I think Harris and Hezonja are both due to become free agents in the same summer... the former unrestricted and latter restricted. Dipo should be included with those two as a sixth man candidate. Probably down to which two are most reliable from 3pt range at the time. Also helps if one is actually open for the role before being forced into it. If we're starting AG at the 4 I like Harris alongside him due to mismatches/switches. I think there is a very good chance it will be Dipo since he can run an offense and also create for himself. FWIW, seems guards have dominated the Sixth Man of the Year award over the last decade. Of course, if Hezonja turns out to be a much better 3 than 2 then that changes things..."
OrlandoMagic,3e4vpc,REEB,2,Wed Jul 22 02:10:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't disagree with any of that necessarily.  But I don't really see Mario as a 2.  The league is getting smaller and smaller, I think it's a lot more likely that he plays the 4 more than the 2 tbh.  He's definitely a forward to me, and I agree with your other comment about AG developing into a sure starter because of his defense.  But with the current core, I can't really see Dipo as the 6th man simply because I don't really see Mario playing much SG, if any."
OrlandoMagic,3e4vpc,CaptainBananaFish,2,Wed Jul 22 03:54:11 2015 UTC,"Tobias off the bench as instant offense, he seems to be the most one demential player out of the bunch."
OrlandoMagic,3e4vpc,JustinSchwimmer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:06:38 2015 UTC,"Most likely to come off the bench would be Tobias Harris. But I honestly think we will trade at least one of them in a couple years, maybe even this season. Most likely to be traded would be Vuc or Tobias."
OrlandoMagic,3e2jp7,rsdio,11,Tue Jul 21 13:42:48 2015 UTC,"That's a very fair article. My problem with Tobias was that he gets tunnel vision when he has the ball and that's Lowe's main concern as well. I don't mind the defense as long as the effort is there, and it usually is.   It also blows my mind that Harris is still only 23"
OrlandoMagic,3e2jp7,bizort,6,Tue Jul 21 14:54:57 2015 UTC,The lack of passing irks me a bit. I just can't believe it's just habitual. I remember reading that the spurs practice making the extra pass in practice and always see them make the extra pass even when they're wide open. 14/13 seconds left on the shot clock taking contested 3s is just not going to cut it. Hopefully Skiles will actually implement a system of heavy ball movement and Tobias can get better. The magic always looked stagnant last year and it was frustrating
OrlandoMagic,3e2jp7,Orlandipo3,2,Tue Jul 21 16:35:07 2015 UTC,"Idk if that's quite right.  Tunnel vision and trigger happy are not the same thing, and he seems to be much more of the latter."
OrlandoMagic,3e2jp7,CaptainBananaFish,8,Wed Jul 22 00:01:07 2015 UTC,GET LOWEEEEE! I love Lowes articles. I also thought that it was a very fair article and I think the gamble will payoff under Skiles.
OrlandoMagic,3e2jp7,HKHansson,7,Tue Jul 21 16:57:28 2015 UTC,"It's always good to see that while most NBA writers forget we exist, Lowe will occasionally write an article highlighting our team or one of our players."
OrlandoMagic,3e2jp7,Joezee0801,3,Tue Jul 21 16:50:11 2015 UTC,Glad to hear Tobias is readying his body to play the 4 more.
OrlandoMagic,3e2jp7,UpvotesArePeople,4,Tue Jul 21 19:50:58 2015 UTC,This is a really great analysis and describes why I haven't been that high on him. The good news is that he acknowledges his areas of development.
OrlandoMagic,3e3hfe,dipodunk,8,Tue Jul 21 17:49:54 2015 UTC,Vooch posterizing Gasol is still my fave. Probably my favorite play during the whole rebuild thus far.
OrlandoMagic,3e3hfe,MagicInOrlando,7,Tue Jul 21 18:33:49 2015 UTC,More than the Tobias Harris buzzer beater dunk against OKC?!
OrlandoMagic,3e3hfe,ultranonymous11,2,Tue Jul 21 18:34:43 2015 UTC,"Loved that as well, but you kind of expect Tobes to pull off stuff like that every once in a while. The Vooch play was way out of left field. I think he even surprised himself."
OrlandoMagic,3e3hfe,MagicInOrlando,7,Tue Jul 21 18:49:52 2015 UTC,Can the season please start already? And i'm surprised that we didn't have any alley-oops in here but i'm sure that will change this season :)

OrlandoMagic,3dz1f1,Goshawk3118191,12,Mon Jul 20 18:10:29 2015 UTC,"THE TOP TEN   Milwaukee Bucks (Projected three-year WARP: 92.5) Key young players: John Henson, Greg Monroe, Khris Middleton, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Michael Carter-Williams, Jabari Parker   The Bucks cemented this spot when they signed free-agent Monroe this summer. Monroe doesn't turn 26 until June of next season, yet he likely will be the oldest member of a Milwaukee starting lineup that will grow together over the next few years. Middleton has already established himself as one of the top 10 shooting guards in the league, and if we were re-selecting the 2013 draft, Antetokounmpo might be the first player taken (though it would probably be Utah's Rudy Gobert). And these numbers are almost certainly underselling Parker, whose rookie numbers don't give him a great baseline from which to project.   New Orleans Pelicans (90.6) Key young players: Anthony Davis, Jrue Holiday   The Pellies aren't really that young of a team, with only two players likely to be on the roster who fit the criteria for these ratings. But one of them is a doozy: By the method used here to generate three-year forecasts, Davis not only tops all young players, he tops all players period, regardless of service time.  Rudy Gobert's three-year forecast ranks third among under-26 players. Nathaniel Butler/NBAE/Getty Images 3. Utah Jazz (90.0) Key young players: Rudy Gobert, Derrick Favors, Trey Burke, Rodney Hood, Alec Burks, Dante Exum, Trey Lyles  Gobert's amazing second season buoys a young Utah core that is brimming with both talent and depth. Gobert's three-year forecast ranks third among under-26 players. If Exum makes a second-year leap, it's quite possible the Jazz will top these rankings if we revisit them during the season.   Boston Celtics (82.7)   Key young players: Jared Sullinger, Kelly Olynyk, R.J. Hunter, Marcus Smart, Jae Crowder, Terry Rozier  Everybody is waiting on the Celtics to acquire or develop their next superstar, but in the meantime Danny Ainge has put together one of the deepest rosters of young talent in the league. The talent pool in Boston was made even deeper this summer with the additions of Rozier, Hunter and Jordan Mickey through the draft, and the recent acquisition of Perry Jones III via the trade market. Is there a star here? Can the crafty Ainge parlay this group into his next big three? At least he has given the Celtics plenty to work with.   Philadelphia 76ers (73.6)   Key young players: Robert Covington, Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes, Isaiah Canaan, Tony Wroten, Jahlil Okafor  Sadly, we're leaving Joel Embiid out of the rankings. It would be difficult to generate a projection for him at this point given the likelihood of another missed season. We also aren't including premier draft-and-stash talent Dario Saric. So if you want to mentally tack on a few WARP for these omissions, then perhaps you can see Sam Hinkie's rebuilding plan as being even further down the road than it appears here.   Portland Trail Blazers (73.2) Key young players: Damian Lillard, Al-Farouq Aminu, Meyers Leonard, Noah Vonleh, Maurice Harkless, C.J. McCollum   The Blazers did a pretty nifty job of redirecting their priorities in the wake of LaMarcus Aldridge's departure, not to mention the exits of Nicolas Batum, Wesley Matthews and Robin Lopez. Lillard gives Portland a young star to lead a rapid rebuild, and the offseason acquisitions of Aminu, Vonleh and Harkless have helped bolster the young depth. Vonleh could turn out to be better than Aldridge someday, while McCollum, Leonard and Allen Crabbe should all benefit from expanded responsibilities.   Charlotte Hornets (73.2)   Key young players: Kemba Walker, Frank Kaminsky, Jeremy Lamb, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Troy Daniels, Cody Zeller  The metrics like Kaminsky, who enters his rookie year ranking 24th among the under-26 set in three-year WARP. Walker makes the ratings by just missing the cut-off age. His three-year WARP forecast is 21.1, so he skews the numbers a bit. Still, there is room for growth in Charlotte, as Zeller and Kidd-Gilchrist both have a way to go before they hit the ceilings we thought they had when they were drafted.   Toronto Raptors (71.2) Key young players: Jonas Valanciunas, Delon Wright, Bismack Biyombo, Cory Joseph, Terrence Ross, Bruno Caboclo   The metrics love Delon Wright, though in reality he'll be in direct competition with Joseph for court time. Still, the signing of Biyombo was one of the unsung terrific moves of the summer. He joins Caboclo as young guys who won't even necessarily be asked to play big roles in the short term, but have a bunch of potential to be big producers down the road.   Orlando Magic (70.1) Key young players: Nikola Vucevic, Tobias Harris, Elfrid Payton, Victor Oladipo, Aaron Gordon, Mario Hezonja, Evan Fournier   Orlando's talent is well stocked at every position, which gives new coach Scott Skiles a lot of options when it comes to forging his key units going forward. We know he'll have a defensive group as one of his preferred lineups, and the Magic have the versatility and athleticism to make a major leap on that end this season.   Detroit Pistons (58.7) Key young players: Andre Drummond, Stanley Johnson, Spencer Dinwiddie, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Darrun Hilliard II, Reggie Bullock   This is almost all Drummond, who ranks second behind Davis in the under-26 forecasts. If Drummond doesn't hit those superstar benchmarks the system thinks he'll get, Detroit will be in trouble. But Stan Van Gundy has reshaped the Pistons' roster to make Drummond the unchallenged centerpiece. The release of Josh Smith and the loss of Monroe in free agency puts a lot of pressure on Drummond, as Detroit got nothing in return for either player. By the way, since you're wondering, Reggie Jackson missed the cut-off age by just a few days. His three-year forecast is 11.9, which would move the Pistons up a spot or two."
OrlandoMagic,3dz1f1,alan4884,6,Mon Jul 20 19:23:05 2015 UTC,"THE NEXT TEN   Sacramento Kings (Projected three-year WARP: 54.2); 12. Indiana Pacers (52.0); 13. Washington Wizards (51.4); 14. San Antonio Spurs (49.5); 15. Minnesota Timberwolves (47.5); 16. Houston Rockets (45.4); 17. Los Angeles Lakers (41.8); 18. Chicago Bulls (41.1); 19. Oklahoma City Thunder (39.5); 20. Cleveland Cavaliers (33.4).   Indiana almost made the top 10 simply because Paul George fell on the right side of the cut-off age. Washington is the team to watch, as both John Wall and Bradley Beal are under 26, as is hard-charging Otto Porter. Given the mix of young talent and veterans on hand, if the Wizards make a spirited run next spring, the Kevin Durant situation could get really interesting. On the downside, the Timberwolves lag in our forecast to a surprising degree. Andrew Wiggins' baseline is barely replacement level. We know he's better than that and it's highly likely that he'll look a lot better this time next season.  You can say the same thing about Karl-Anthony Towns and maybe even Zach LaVine. Still, for all the lofty draft picks Minnesota has had, it's important to remember that at this point, they skew much more toward potential than production. As for the Lakers, Jordan Clarkson and D'Angelo Russell come out just fine, but they need a big step forward from Julius Randle to really start moving the WARP needle in the right direction.  THE BOTTOM TEN   Atlanta Hawks (Projected three-year WARP: 33.0); 22. Phoenix Suns (26.3); 23. Denver Nuggets (22.1); 24. New York Knicks (22.0); 25. Brooklyn Nets (18.0); 26. Golden State Warriors (11.9); 27. Dallas Mavericks (7.3); 28. Miami Heat (6.6); 29. Memphis Grizzlies (6.2); 30. Los Angeles Clippers (0.2).   The teams that stand out are the ones who aren't competing for championships and, thus, shouldn't be in this group. That includes Denver, New York and Brooklyn. The Nuggets and Knicks have plenty of reason to hope that Emmanuel Mudiay and Kristaps Porzingis, respectively, will outstrip their projections. The Nets' picture is truly dreary though. Their highest-ranked forecasts are for Thomas Robinson and Chris McCullough, and it's debatable that the latter should have even been included given his knee injury and probable unavailability."

Gordon drafted by Clips in 08  Tyreke in 09  Jrue in 09 (watched him in the college tourney when I was in high school)   Omer Asik in 2010  Davis in 2012  I personally think you have to have been drafted in the last 4/5 years to be considered a young core. I'm looking at NBA experience, not age though"

AP Photo/Aaron Gash Bradford Doolittle, ESPN Staff Writer 3K Shares Email Print Comment Beginning with last month's draft and culminating with the summer leagues, the focus has been on the NBA's youngest players since the Golden State Warriors finished off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals several weeks ago.  It's part of the annual cycle in the league and it makes for a nice balance. One team's fans get to celebrate, while those who root for the handful of other top contenders plot to overthrow the newly crowned champions. The rest are left to hope for the future, and this is the time of the year to dream of all these young pieces growing into something special.  EDITOR'S PICKS  Doolittle: Ranking offseason PG signings Bradford Doolittle writes that Mo Williams -- not Deron Williams or Rajon Rondo -- was the best point guard acquisition this offseason.  Doolittle: Plugging holes in free agency Players like Dorell Wright and Matt Bonner might not start, but they could still become important free-agent pickups for the right team. Today we're ranking the top young cores across the league using projected three-year WARP. The error bars on these kinds of forecasts are large by nature. For one thing, young players are inherently more difficult to project than veterans. And once you get beyond the coming season, the picture changes in ways that even the best projection model can't foresee.  But we do the best we can with the data available, and try to anticipate aging curves using factors like age, experience, athletic indicators and draft slot. Nevertheless, if a player has a low statistical baseline from whence to grow a projection, it's tough to predict All-Star production.  In the end, the system is a little biased toward players with at least some positive NBA production already under their belts. Still, this is a great way to glimpse the teams strictly through the prism of the young talent that they have accumulated. That's defined here as any player likely to be on the roster who won't yet be 26 by the end of the 2015-16 regular season. For some teams, including our top-ranked club, the good news just keeps getting better. For others, well, you can always just disagree.  Edit: This is the first part of the article"
OrlandoMagic,3dz1f1,alan4884,7,Mon Jul 20 19:21:17 2015 UTC,"I know its hard not to be biased, but how are we not top 5 just from a pure talent perspective?"
OrlandoMagic,3dz1f1,BrotherBroseph,2,Mon Jul 20 18:43:08 2015 UTC,"I think the makers value shooting too much. Elf isn't a shooter, Dipo was just a 34% shooter from 3 (even though he was pretty automatic at times), Gordon wasn't a ""great"" shooter in year 1, Vucevic's range extends to deep mid range, and while Harris improved drastically at 3P%, his career average is 32% from deep. That, on top of not having a legit starting caliber center (sorry Dedmon, I love you, but you're not starting caliber yet), and people probably forgetting already that we have Hezonja and Fournier who can both shoot on the bench, I guess it's easy to overlook us.  That being said though, I think our 3P% will increase big time with the additions of healthy Fournier hopefully, Hezonja, Watson, and potentially Tyler Harvey."

OrlandoMagic,3dz1f1,IOnlyCareAboutIrony,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:54 2015 UTC,"A Blazers fan here, but I get your notion of our team. Yes, we have been gutted, and we've added a ton of young players to the team. However, we've added young players to build a core around Lillard, a fast and athletic team that will try to run a lot this season.  Vonleh is 19 years old, will turn 20 this year. He would've been a lottery pick this year if he had stayed at Indiana. We got him from Charlotte for Batum, who we would not have resigned, and he is Aldridge's replacement. He is a bit more athletic than Aldridge when we first got LA in 2006, and Vonleh has 11.5 inch hands, but is an inch shorter than LA. He was on the bench of a Hornets team that was pushing for the play-offs, so he didn't get time and was injured so last season was a write-off. Big men though take a while to develop so Vonleh will not be a finished product this season, though he had a nice summer league. While Vonleh has potential to be a star, I hope he can become a nice replacement for LA.  McCollum and Leonard I'd like to pair. McCollum was plagued by two injuries in both his first seasons, so it took him time to adjust to the team. However, we saw glimpses of his potential last season, especially in the play-offs, when he went off against the Grizzlies. McCollum can shoot, while people in the pre-draft said he was a Lillard clone, he doesn't handle the ball like Lillard and is better suited as a SG, as he can find his own shot. He needs work defensively, like Leonard. Leonard is an athletic center with great height that has started to find his stroke. He has been a work in progress, but now he is able to shoot from long range and even has decent numbers from behind the arc, where he shoots from often when he has the minutes. Leonard could be a valuable commodity once he hits FA.  Now I'll just list of the players I'm foreign with:  Adding Plumlee gives us another athlete to work with. An efficient low-volume shooter in the paint and gives decent rebounding. He did well with the Nets when B. Lopez was injured and should be an adequate replacement for RoLo. Aminu was drafted by Olshey, so he has more knowledge on him than most. Aminu doesn't have a scoring touch, but is athletic and gives great effort on both sides of the ball. Decent defender and has potential still, as shown in the play-offs with the Mavs.  You all have more knowledge on Moe Harkless on me, but I've been told by a Magic fan he never really got minutes and I feel he can get them now as my team has been gutted. He too is another athletic (you get the theme?) high effort athlete that's a decent defender but not polished offensively.  All in all, our new centerpiece will be Lillard with McCollum hopefully improving to the point where we too have a great sharpshooting backcourt duo like the GSW with all the new young and athletic players becoming role players on the team."
OrlandoMagic,3dz1f1,MarkTeixeira,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:34:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your thoughts, and the interesting rundown on your team."
OrlandoMagic,3dz1f1,rockinwithmycockout,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:43 2015 UTC,"Magic fan living in Eugene Oregon here, who watches most Blazer games and roots for the Blazers for 80 games a season.   Unless Harkless finds his confidence, he's probably not going to make it past this season with you guys. I was a big fan of Moe, I really wanted him to succeed here in Orlando, he just seemed to have lost his motor over the past 2 seasons. It was a great pickup by the Blazers tho, low (almost no) risk/high reward. He is hyper athletic, and showed promise his first season, but the past 2 seasons have been utter garbage. He'll be involved for a handful of plays and then just disappear for the rest of the game. Some claim he was ruined by Vaughan, and while that may be true, there were some things said in Kyle O'Quinns goodbye letter that lead me to believe he has attitude issues. I think Slotts is a good coach for him. I'd definitely feel better about throwing Crabbe out there at this point than Markless.   Unlike Vonleah, Harkless got his chance, and that's where I think the big difference is. Vonleah's highlights from summer league looked really impressive. And I didn't like Plumlee coming out of college, but he's been better in the pros than I thought he would and I think that was a decent pickup for you guys as well.   PDX's 'rebuilding' period will be nothing like ours has been. Shouldn't take as long. Now if you guys could get Dame to play D at an least average level....."
OrlandoMagic,3dz1f1,MarkTeixeira,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:01 2015 UTC,"Lillard's been working on his defense and he's made strides last season, but still struggles on the pick and roll. I forgot about Crabbe, he's looked really great in the few games he was in during summer league. Crabbe had made some strides last season in the few games he started last season but was a bit inconsistent."
OrlandoMagic,3dz1f1,rockinwithmycockout,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:21 2015 UTC,"I think you guys are really going to feel the loss of Wes Matthews. For the past 2 years I've been telling anyone that'll listen that he's the most underrated player in the league. Killer defense, great shooter, great community dude. I think his absence is going to hurt Lillard, at least this year, as Dame has no choice but to become a significantly better defender.   I like Crabbe, he was definitely inconsistent last year but if he can bring what he brought to summer to the regular season then that'll help ease the loss of Batum.   One side benefit of all of the changes going through PDX is that you guys are going to get a lot younger. It'll be a rough couple seasons, especially in the west, but you guys will end up alright."
OrlandoMagic,3dz1f1,J_Melo,2,Tue Jul 21 23:23:11 2015 UTC,I cant read the article and the formatting here is making it difficult to follow. Can someone imgur.com this article please?
OrlandoMagic,3dz1f1,BlueHundred,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:38 2015 UTC,I don't get it. You guys have one of the best young cores in the league. I still like Bucks the best and Jazz are up there too. I don't understand how the list was made.
OrlandoMagic,3dz1f1,Herakleios,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:17:43 2015 UTC,"In terms of young cores, only teams I'd actually rank us over on that list are Charlotte, Toronto, and Detroit. I'd say we're probably pretty close to Portland in terms of young talent, but I'm fine giving them the edge here because they have one bonafide young star in Damian Lillard.  Cletics, eh... I guess I'd rank them over us too, but that one I think is a little closer. I think Vooch is better than any one guy on that team, and the rest of the roster is pretty comparable. They have/had a huge coaching advantage, which I think is why they outperformed us last season."

OrlandoMagic,3dzdvq,BrotherBroseph,5,Mon Jul 20 21:01:51 2015 UTC,"I think most likely we won't sign him for this season. But even if we don't sign him for this season, we still retain his rights next year (I'm reasonably certain he can stay in the D-League for 2 seasons before we have to renounce his rights). So he can go to the D-League or even Europe and work on his game.   I think Marble stays and we sign another FA big (Quincy Acy?) before the season starts. We're kinda guard heavy now, so I think even Marble coming back isn't a sure bet.   Here's our current roster:    Evan Fournier Channing Frye Aaron Gordon Tobias Harris Mario Hezonja Andrew Nicholson Victor Oladipo Elfrid Payton Jason Smith Nikola Vucevic C.J. Watson Keith Appling Dewayne Dedmon** Devyn Marble** Tyler Harvey**   **team options"
OrlandoMagic,3dzdvq,rockinwithmycockout,4,Mon Jul 20 22:31:09 2015 UTC,I think it's more complicated than that. I believe we are required to offer him at least a minimum deal in September or he becomes a free agent. He can either take that deal or turn it down to go play overseas in which case we would keep his rights. I see us signing him to a multi-year deal with some team options and sending him to the d-league next season for development.  How I see our depth chart:  Payton / Watson / Appling  Dipo / Fournier / Harvey  Harris / Hezonja / Marble  AG / Frye / Nicholson  Vucevic / Smith / Dedmon
OrlandoMagic,3dzdvq,REEB,3,Tue Jul 21 01:01:12 2015 UTC,I approve of this depth chart. Hope we actually get to see our roster used like this. So curious as to how our minutes will be distributed.
OrlandoMagic,3dzdvq,__theo,2,Tue Jul 21 03:24:56 2015 UTC,"Like it though, dude was a beast in SL from what I saw"
OrlandoMagic,3dzdvq,EyeoftheTyga,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:42:37 2015 UTC,Who?
OrlandoMagic,3dzdvq,jarkarawr,5,Mon Jul 20 19:55:39 2015 UTC,"MSU star under Izzo, went undrafted in 2014"
OrlandoMagic,3dzdvq,fieldfinder,4,Mon Jul 20 19:57:32 2015 UTC,Ok thank you. Has he been on our summer league team? I haven't heard the name before so I don't know anything about him
OrlandoMagic,3dzdvq,jarkarawr,7,Mon Jul 20 20:05:17 2015 UTC,"He led our summer league B team, which did better than our A team. He played hard and drew a ton of fouls."
OrlandoMagic,3dzdvq,REEB,7,Mon Jul 20 20:08:58 2015 UTC,"He's also been on the roster of our D-League affiliate the Eerie BayHawks since March, so I'm sure we've had a pretty good look at him."
OrlandoMagic,3dzdvq,UpvotesArePeople,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:17 2015 UTC,Yeah didn't pay attention to the other team. Thank you for the info. I also found an article with a little about him http://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/238810/Keith-Appling-Agrees-To-Two-Year-Deal-With-Magic
OrlandoMagic,3duvnq,asdfqwerasdfqwerasdf,6,Sun Jul 19 18:29:56 2015 UTC,"There is literally no projection anywhere in this article, lol"
OrlandoMagic,3duvnq,RonnocFjord,5,Sun Jul 19 22:31:22 2015 UTC,It's a slideshow. Took me a while to find it too. Slideshows suck.
OrlandoMagic,3duvnq,whtge8,3,Mon Jul 20 03:28:21 2015 UTC,"ahh, thanks man!"
OrlandoMagic,3duvnq,RonnocFjord,3,Mon Jul 20 03:36:53 2015 UTC,I think the depth chart will look similar to this.   PG1: Elfrid Payton  PG2: CJ Watson/ Victor Oladipo/ Evan Fournier  SG1: Victor Oladipo  SG2: Evan Fournier/ Mario Hezonja/ Devyn Marble  SF1: Tobias Harris  SF2: Mario Hezonja/Aaron Gordon/ Devyn Marble  PF1: Aaron Gordon  PF2: Tobias Harris/ Channing Frye/ Dewayne Dedmon/ Jason Smith/ Andrew Nicholson  C1: Nik Vucevic  C2: Dewayne Dedmon/ Jason Smith
OrlandoMagic,3duvnq,ninety4kid,2,Mon Jul 20 07:00:17 2015 UTC,Harris and Gordon are starting.
OrlandoMagic,3duvnq,whtge8,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:39:14 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine the Magic starting two 2nd years, a 3rd year, and two 5th year players on opening night. I'm assuming Channing Frye will start to open us off and we will slowly bring Gordon into the starting lineup around Game 15-20 possibly barring any injuries."
OrlandoMagic,3duvnq,mjridiculouz,2,Mon Jul 20 16:47:25 2015 UTC,Why not? They are the most talented players on the team.
OrlandoMagic,3duvnq,whtge8,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:40:48 2015 UTC,I can't imagine management/our coaching staff to think it's a good idea to start off the NBA seasonw with those guys. It's not about how you start but how you finish and that will be the goal for Orlando since they want to make the playoffs and i'm sure we will eventually see the Payton-Oladipo-Harris-Gordon-Vucevic starting lineup but I think that they want a veteran presence to start us off just for precautionary reasons.
OrlandoMagic,3duvnq,mjridiculouz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:07:35 2015 UTC,I'm going to have to strongly disagree with you on this one. Put the 5 best players on the court. It's time for these young players to step up and be leaders. They are our best players by far. Having Frye in the starting 5 just because he is a 'veteran presence' will absolutely destroy our defense. Don't you remember last year?
OrlandoMagic,3duvnq,whtge8,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:11:07 2015 UTC,"I remember Vaughn making awful rotations, Not being able to use Aaron Gordon because of injury, and then seeing Borrego make the bad decision on making our perimeter guys swarm the paint just to help Vucevic. Look we already know our rim protecting is nonexistent or else we would've done something about it this off-season. Skiles just accepted that we won't have that and i'm assuming he's gonna work around it. Frye is a proven shooter while Gordon isn't and right now we need to spread the floor for Oladipo and Payton and as much as I LOVED Gordon in the SL i'm coming into this season expecting that we won't be seeing that Gordon just to be safe. I also remember us not being that bad when Frye started off the season with us but eventually over time it wasn't working. I agree that I would rather have Gordon start the season off and hope he can spread the floor as much as we would like but if we are predicting the opening night starters I would say they will put Frye over Gordon and see how that does."
OrlandoMagic,3duvnq,mjridiculouz,2,Mon Jul 20 18:52:57 2015 UTC,The stress that Hennigan and Skiles place on defense is enough to convince me Frye won't start.
OrlandoMagic,3duvnq,whtge8,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:59:05 2015 UTC,Hoping you are right.
OrlandoMagic,3duvnq,mjridiculouz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:13:17 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, I believe Frye will start the year at PF"
OrlandoMagic,3duvnq,Day_C_Metrollin,-4,Mon Jul 20 17:50:50 2015 UTC,My logic suggests we end up with a line up of:  PG: Payton SG: Oladipo SF: Hezonja PF: Gordon C:  Vucevic    6th: Harris 7th: Fournier 8th: Dedmon
OrlandoMagic,3duvnq,Shermanpk,7,Mon Jul 20 12:55:48 2015 UTC,Damn we're paying Tobias the big bucks to come off the bench? I mean if it shakes out that way then I can't be mad.
OrlandoMagic,3duvnq,nautika,4,Mon Jul 20 15:19:17 2015 UTC,He won't come off the bench. Mario will be the scorer off the bench.
OrlandoMagic,3duvnq,whtge8,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:41:15 2015 UTC,I agree. I was just surprised the user above had Tobias listed as 6th
OrlandoMagic,3dtp3h,yamqlerk,2,Sun Jul 19 10:37:49 2015 UTC,"Oh dear lord, are the hoops just built better or was Shaq too big?"
OrlandoMagic,3dtp3h,toomuchfrosting,4,Sun Jul 19 21:03:49 2015 UTC,Yes
OrlandoMagic,3dtp3h,mastrxplodr,2,Sun Jul 19 21:32:01 2015 UTC,The hoops nowadays are very hard to bring down and practically impossible to shatter by a player
OrlandoMagic,3dtp3h,dleec,2,Sun Jul 19 22:46:40 2015 UTC,"Because, Shaq."

OrlandoMagic,3dr5w4,CaptainBananaFish,12,Sat Jul 18 17:42:14 2015 UTC,"Harris' dad went to school with Gervin and eventually became his agent. As a result, Harris has been working out with Gervin since he was 13. It's probably why he goes glass so often near the basket."
OrlandoMagic,3dr5w4,REEB,7,Sat Jul 18 18:48:24 2015 UTC,"Oh damn, that's pretty dope.  Did not know that."
OrlandoMagic,3dr5w4,houseQM,10,Sat Jul 18 18:51:00 2015 UTC,"Tobias is already our go to guy in the clutch, but now he's going to have ICE in his veins. I feel like he and Vuc can be All-Stars this year."
OrlandoMagic,3dqutx,mjridiculouz,10,Sat Jul 18 16:02:44 2015 UTC,Cousins is definitely a better offensive center. No question. One is a near-superstar the other is a solid starter.
OrlandoMagic,3dqutx,HKHansson,5,Sat Jul 18 16:30:15 2015 UTC,"I've been the biggest supporter of Vucevic this year, but he is not a top 3 center. However, he is probably a top 3 offensive center. Cousins is by far #1, maybe Pau, and then Vucevic for offense. I would have put Al Jefferson, but he didn't play a lot last year, and Gortat, Marc Gasol, and Horford were all right below them. With maybe Brook Lopez too.   So yeah, Vucevic is a top 3 offensive center. I love his turn around hook, I'm hoping he can make that a signature move, and keep improving it."
OrlandoMagic,3dqutx,rps215,2,Sat Jul 18 16:59:23 2015 UTC,"What does Cousins do that Vucevic can't or what does Cousins do better than Vucevic? I've seen Cousins play and he didn't give make me think ""Wow he is the best offensive center in the league"" now i'm starting to assume that I got really unlucky with the games I watched of him because I know he's a great player but eye-test wise I don't see how its an obvious answer for Cousins like people make it out to be. I'm talking strictly offensive side of the basketball by the way."
OrlandoMagic,3dqutx,rps215,2,Sat Jul 18 19:04:41 2015 UTC,"In the paint, I think Cousins has a Shaq level of dominance, in terms of size and how hard it is to stop him, and how hard it is to defend him without fouling. That's something we'll just have to disagree on with the eye test, I guess.  However, Vucevic shoots a higher percentage at the rim, which I did not expect. Here is Vucevic's heat map, and here is Cousins'. I will admit, I was mostly thinking offensive ability in the post, not the whole thing, and Vucevic is a better shooter, so that should weigh for something I guess.   And yeah, I read it as top 3 center overall, and after I realized I misread it, I didn't feel like changing what I wrote lol"
OrlandoMagic,3dqutx,VictorOladeepthroat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:11:07 2015 UTC,Cousins is far from shaq level buddy. If he had shaq level dominance he'd be better than Lebron. He has shaq's style of bangin in the post and is very good but he isn't close to Shaq
OrlandoMagic,3dqutx,rps215,3,Sun Jul 19 02:55:50 2015 UTC,"I meant his style, not his performance."
OrlandoMagic,3dqutx,VictorOladeepthroat,2,Sun Jul 19 03:00:30 2015 UTC,Oh kk
OrlandoMagic,3dqutx,radardog95,2,Sun Jul 19 18:06:00 2015 UTC,"I'll say this about Cousins vs Vucevic. Cousins is probably more consistent on the offensive end, but Vucevic has a little more finesse. Cousins wins the defensive aspect by a landslide though, unfortunately.."
OrlandoMagic,3dqutx,Kaiiu,2,Sat Jul 18 16:51:59 2015 UTC,Cousins
OrlandoMagic,3dqutx,UnfairWalnuts,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:43:38 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the narrative that Cousins is a great offensive center. He's a black hole offensively, and shoots below 50% A great offensive center would be a better passer, and should shoot over 50% I'm not saying that Vuc is some world beater by any means, but Cousins is drastically overrated. He's nothing more than a stat-stuffer on bad team."
OrlandoMagic,3dqutx,Lhernana2j,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:49:24 2015 UTC,Cousins is a little bit better on both ends.  They are both borderline all stars as Boogie got in because of a few others were injured. Could have easily been Vuc who was added to the team. If Vuc improves on defense then we will have the perfect fit. Vuc can open the lane unlike Cousins. We got the better deal by far. Great contract and no drama.
OrlandoMagic,3dofsa,hezonjabandwagon,2,Fri Jul 17 22:55:33 2015 UTC,We all know who the real Super Mario will be Chalmers you don't have hops like Hezonja and your not relevant anymore.
OrlandoMagic,3dofsa,Krod2,2,Sat Jul 18 16:11:12 2015 UTC,I think he made that choice because he saw people were referring to Hezonja as Super Mario and he wanted to do something to make it official.
OrlandoMagic,3dofsa,no6969el,2,Sat Jul 18 14:09:49 2015 UTC,A bit of a stretch... Dont you think?
OrlandoMagic,3dofsa,j4jaymin,11,Sat Jul 18 03:42:54 2015 UTC,I think it was a joke. Pretty funny though
OrlandoMagic,3dny59,Abiv23,8,Fri Jul 17 20:33:17 2015 UTC,Dammit! He just doesn't seem to catch a break!

OrlandoMagic,3dny59,mjridiculouz,5,Fri Jul 17 20:50:25 2015 UTC,Sounds like they got in a fight rather than just horseplay. His brother sounds way too guilty on twitter.
OrlandoMagic,3dny59,REEB,4,Fri Jul 17 22:54:53 2015 UTC,"Wait, so he got injured while playing HORSE? Or horseplaying?"
OrlandoMagic,3dny59,thenotoriouscliff,5,Fri Jul 17 21:49:11 2015 UTC,"""At least I might be a starter"" Cracccccckkkk."

OrlandoMagic,3dny59,AndrewFlash,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:33:23 2015 UTC,"At what point does weird stuff like this begin to be a red flag for being injury prone and having somewhat weak bones.  Edit: haha, I knew the downvote brigade would start, but don't you people wonder about this stuff?"
OrlandoMagic,3dny59,Ellimistopher,7,Fri Jul 17 20:40:51 2015 UTC,Curry and Horford were injury prone when they came into the NBA. I wouldn't overreact too much with something like this.
OrlandoMagic,3dny59,mjridiculouz,0,Fri Jul 17 20:59:00 2015 UTC,"I mean, Horford missed over 50 games 2 years ago, and over 70 games 4 years ago, it isn't like he ""stopped"" being injury prone. He had a healthy season last year, and I love the guy. I really hope the Magic target him next offseason as our big acquisition.  I am just saying red flags, this is a red flag for me. Much like Kyrie Irving's weird ailments that he suffers."
OrlandoMagic,3dny59,Ellimistopher,5,Fri Jul 17 21:02:29 2015 UTC,Irving's injuries (playoffs this year aside) were largely a product of the cavs sitting him to tank
OrlandoMagic,3dny59,Ellimistopher,9,Fri Jul 17 21:51:45 2015 UTC,I dunno about that.
OrlandoMagic,3dny59,subutaime,7,Fri Jul 17 21:52:59 2015 UTC,He clearly got his ass whooped by his brother. Nothing to see here.
OrlandoMagic,3dny59,ajax0626,2,Fri Jul 17 22:26:01 2015 UTC,Probably when they are related. Currently they are on opposite ends of the body

There is a thorough audition process, like there would be for any paid gig. It's worth a shot, but I would definitely brush up on your skills before you walk into it."
OrlandoMagic,3dnv5i,computerwiz720,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:29:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've known a few people on it and they all have some combination of professional drumming, wgi, teaching and other gigs. I'm sure the audition is the most important part but those are the kind of people you'll be compared against to even get that far.    If it's something you want to do, by all means, go for it. I'm not sure what your experience level is but definitely get yourself prepared. Good luck!"
OrlandoMagic,3dnv5i,mastrxplodr,2,Sat Jul 18 00:10:24 2015 UTC,Call the front office? I'm sure they can direct you to someone.
OrlandoMagic,3dj2f3,ominating,12,Thu Jul 16 17:54:06 2015 UTC,"I'm glad Vuc is finally getting some recognition. It's no All-Star team, but it'll get his name out there."
OrlandoMagic,3dj2f3,UpvotesArePeople,5,Thu Jul 16 18:20:13 2015 UTC,are they serious with the lineup for team world? lol  easy win for Vuc
OrlandoMagic,3dj2f3,bamboo_master,4,Thu Jul 16 20:20:30 2015 UTC,Good. The more practice the better.
OrlandoMagic,3dj2f3,whtge8,3,Fri Jul 17 01:31:50 2015 UTC,I hope he glues himself to Marc during all the practices. Marc could certainly teach Vuc a thing or five about defensive positioning and such.
OrlandoMagic,3dj2f3,ultranonymous11,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:28:27 2015 UTC,He always said he has tried to model his game after Marc.
OrlandoMagic,3dj2f3,whtge8,-4,Fri Jul 17 19:04:57 2015 UTC,Imagine he gets injured
OrlandoMagic,3dj2f3,VictorOladeepthroat,3,Fri Jul 17 02:42:23 2015 UTC,Thankfully Vooch doesn't really play a brand of basketball that's susceptible to many injuries. Here's to hoping he has a great game with not injuries.
OrlandoMagic,3dj2f3,MagicInOrlando,-1,Fri Jul 17 15:41:39 2015 UTC,"This guy shouldn't be downvoted, injuries to star players are a nightmare we Magic fans are not eager to relive."
OrlandoMagic,3dj2f3,subutaime,3,Fri Jul 17 13:38:15 2015 UTC,Yeah but why even bring it up?
OrlandoMagic,3dj2f3,whtge8,-1,Fri Jul 17 16:37:31 2015 UTC,"It's a message board. Some people will say things that are obvious to must, but still within the scope of the discussion.  Edit: most, not must."

OrlandoMagic,3dfsdj,rps215,6,Wed Jul 15 22:47:08 2015 UTC,"A lot of Nicholson's faults are hard to measure with stats in a very clear way, but yeah, he's got to find a niche.  If he really can become respectable in rebounding and defense, then I could see him coming in a la ben gordon as a heat check in the post, where he could dominate against some PFs who are poor post defenders.  I think his PT will ultimately come down to how well he grasps skiles' defense and how well the D can hide his deficiencies. He in no way can play next to Vuc, so I think he needs to come in with Dedmon (when he comes in, I still like Frye over him) and will need to look to score like a Mo Speights or Darrell Arthur type."
OrlandoMagic,3dfsdj,jive_turkey,3,Wed Jul 15 23:42:50 2015 UTC,"Dude, before you got to the Speights part, that was exactly who I thought he could become. Not quite a shooting forward, but definitely  a heat check big man. Love the comp."

OrlandoMagic,3de4a1,rockinwithmycockout,3,Wed Jul 15 22:23:50 2015 UTC,"There's no real comparison. Nicholson is not really athletic at all, he has that old man game. All 3 guys in this list are hyper athletic freaks that can jump out of the gym. Skiles can't make that athletic ability magically appear.  Andrew has an opportunity to earn playing time since we are weak at PF, hopefully he'll take advantage of that but I'm not very optimistic."

OrlandoMagic,3dbfbb,radardog95,6,Wed Jul 15 01:13:11 2015 UTC,What the hell? We really couldn't even get an unprotected second rounder for Moe? I refuse to believe he is worth absolutely nothing. Why not just keep him then?
OrlandoMagic,3dbfbb,REEB,14,Tue Jul 14 23:48:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's signifying a change. We're all in on our core now and we're going to be gunning for a playoff spot. Having unfilled potential and being a good guy off the court just isn't going to cut it anymore. There isn't room for guys who can't pull their weight on the court, and we'll get rid of those guys as quickly as we can.  At lest, that's what this move tells me."
OrlandoMagic,3dbfbb,tomchaney479,7,Wed Jul 15 00:28:27 2015 UTC,We can still get rid of people and get assets in return though...
OrlandoMagic,3dbfbb,orlrdvxl,10,Wed Jul 15 01:08:34 2015 UTC,His value was at an all time low with how poorly he played last season. By year 3 you're supposed to show improvement in this league... Hark somehow went in the other direction.
OrlandoMagic,3dbfbb,ThunderFan4Life,7,Wed Jul 15 01:25:48 2015 UTC,"Well, Harkless was benched for most of the season and played like garbage when he wasn't, so I'm not sure if we would have gotten any  desirable assets for him. Still, cash or something would have been nice."
OrlandoMagic,3dbfbb,TweetPoster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:23:34 2015 UTC,"Haha, so, being all in means it is OK to give away young players for virtually nothing?  No, that's not how it works.  ORL should've leaked to the media their plans to trade Harkless, thus creating multiple offers.  If a good offer didn't come in, then showcase him during the year up until the all star break."
OrlandoMagic,3dbfbb,orlrdvxl,2,Wed Jul 15 06:57:37 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter if he's young when he is bad at basketball. What is your assessment of the value of a player who could not earn any minutes on a 25 win team?   You could showcase him, but if he played like he did last season, you'd probably end up having to give up assets to get rid of him."
OrlandoMagic,3d9f1b,alan4884,10,Tue Jul 14 15:12:07 2015 UTC,Agree with most of this but I'm not sold on Indiana. Losing Hibbert and West is really going to hurt them imo.
OrlandoMagic,3d9f1b,Kaiiu,4,Tue Jul 14 15:32:32 2015 UTC,Yea the Pacers are going to look different and are going to rely PG13 to be a superstar. But to be honest I think he has it in him. It's going to be fun to follow.
OrlandoMagic,3d9f1b,Kaiiu,3,Tue Jul 14 16:02:31 2015 UTC,"I think PG13 is still going to need some to ""get back"". He didn't look too good in the few games he played this year."
OrlandoMagic,3d9f1b,whtge8,4,Tue Jul 14 19:34:03 2015 UTC,I agree. Everyone seems to have Indiana locked into a playoff spot. They are going to get killed in the paint. George will put up crazy numbers but they will be pretty bad defensively.
OrlandoMagic,3d9f1b,nyceyo,3,Tue Jul 14 17:44:13 2015 UTC,"I think PG will come back stronger than before he was out for a year tho so he will get them with GHill to atleast a 7 or 8 seed. I also think he can be a Top 5 Player and up his scoring since he is still so young.  I dont think Detroit, NY, Charlotte play on our level i think actually that we will fight with Boston and the Pacers for the 6/7/8 seed.  Edit: I actually think Mario can be our 2nd guy on offense right away and can be a dark horse ROY. I wanted to get that out too even without context."
OrlandoMagic,3d9f1b,radardog95,9,Wed Jul 15 11:50:46 2015 UTC,"I'm getting a good vibe for this upcoming season. I think we will be that heart and hustle team that every other team hates playing against. We'll be that 7-8th seed that will be a bitch for the top seeds to play. Coach Skiles will become the next Stan Van Gundy for us. Let's go!  Edit: With that being said, I had a good vibe last season too, so maybe my input isn't the best.."
OrlandoMagic,3d9f1b,VictorOladeepthroat,3,Tue Jul 14 17:07:40 2015 UTC,I had no faith last season with Vaughn. Now I'm getting some good vibes too. That's double the vibes bro
OrlandoMagic,3d9f1b,nyceyo,3,Wed Jul 15 03:21:12 2015 UTC,Better be optimistic than allready going in with a losing mindset :)
OrlandoMagic,3d9f1b,IOnlyCareAboutIrony,5,Wed Jul 15 11:51:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with the others here that the Cavs, Hawks, Wizards, and Bulls are pretty automatic, but outside of those 4 a lot could happen. The Heat are a real wildcard with tons of talent, health concerns, and potential roster troubles. There is a huge lower middle class in the East. The Bucks, Pistons, Magic, and Celtics are up and coming while the Raptors, Nets, and Hornets seem to be on the downswing. Assuming the Heat put it together that leaves 7 teams fighting for 3 spots.   It's possible the Magic nab one, but they are a young team in a crowded field and all it would take is a little bad luck to knock them off the pace."
OrlandoMagic,3d9f1b,stevepwolf,3,Tue Jul 14 17:27:13 2015 UTC,cleveland altanta chicago milwaukee miami washington then 2 spots up for grabs
OrlandoMagic,3d9f1b,jordanstg,5,Tue Jul 14 20:23:49 2015 UTC,I feel like the teams that are locks (in no particular order) are: Heat Cavs Bucks Wizards Hawks Bulls I then think Toronto Orlando Indiana and Detroit will fight for the final two seeds and I think Toronto and Orlando will get them. I think the teams left have no or very little chance: Philli Knicks  Nets Celtics Hornets
OrlandoMagic,3d9f1b,logjam13,8,Tue Jul 14 16:10:22 2015 UTC,"Celtics with no chance? They'll be fighting for one of the bottom seeds. And Charlotte has the potential to be improved, but I don't think they got worse. I think we'll be in the 7-10 range but it's going to be a lot more competitive this year to get into the playoffs"
OrlandoMagic,3d9f1b,PureMagic1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:27:20 2015 UTC,"I just hope we can make some progress, at this point, I feel like we could be a 40-45 win team. This should be enough to snag a playoff spot. Talking about other teams, I think The Cavs, Bulls, Wizards and Bucks are locked. Unlike everyone else I'm not sure if team Basketball aka the Hawks can repeat this regular season performance. Also I am not sure about the Heat, it depends on their veterans health. To conclude it, I think we could finish from 6-8."

Someone always flops, my pick is Charlotte, but the whole division could be in the playoffs, in a vacuum at least. Unfortunately, Toronto, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Chicago, and IMO Detroit are all ahead of us on paper.. It'll be fun to see how we look"
OrlandoMagic,3d6txz,EyeoftheTyga,2,Tue Jul 14 01:20:18 2015 UTC,"Is that our division? Miami, Washington, Atl, are prob gonna be a higher seed. Could beat out Brooklyn, Boston, NY, Philly....the Pacers?"

OrlandoMagic,3d6txz,EyeoftheTyga,3,Tue Jul 14 02:49:14 2015 UTC,Pacers are being overrated. You will see soon how much David West meant for that team along with Roy Hibbert.
OrlandoMagic,3d6txz,mjridiculouz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:00:16 2015 UTC,He's in his mid 30s. They didn't have George last year and barely missed
OrlandoMagic,3d6txz,EyeoftheTyga,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:05:58 2015 UTC,West was a big reason why they were still able to hold on. George isn't gonna be 100% until January if all goes well. their frontcourt is Turner-Mahimi-Hill-Allen. That's probably bottom 3 frontcourt on paper.
OrlandoMagic,3d6txz,mjridiculouz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:13:18 2015 UTC,"True, but aren't the Pacers trying to go towards a fast tempo offense? I think it could work well, with Hill, George, and Monta. Small ball is where it's at for some teams"
OrlandoMagic,3d6txz,EyeoftheTyga,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:25:11 2015 UTC,None of those players are Point Guards. Indiana's biggest thing that kept them from being a legit contender was always being a true point guard away from being in realistic contention
OrlandoMagic,3d6txz,mjridiculouz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:49:10 2015 UTC,I agree with this. Pacers are going to be horrible IMO. George will put up some nice stats but they have nobody else in the front court.
OrlandoMagic,3d6txz,whtge8,3,Tue Jul 14 04:48:59 2015 UTC,"Cleveland, Chicago, Atlanta, Miami, Washington are pretty much locks.    Toronto looked AWFUL at the end of last year. I think it's more likely their hot start was a fluke. I think they're a .500 team this year (maybe worse).  I think Milwaukee got worse. Most of their success was with Knight. They were a much different (and worse) team when he left. They were a team built on length and defense. They switched everything. I honestly don't see how Monroe fits into their squad and they have less outside shooting than us even. Teams are gonna pack the paint and they'll struggle to score.  Until Detroit proves it, they're not better than us. People say they'll be better without Monroe, idk that remains to be seen.  Charlotte is a toss up.  I'm more worried about the Pacers and Celtics than any of the teams I listed above.    I see a lot of potential for us in the East this year. I fully expect to be in the playoffs."
OrlandoMagic,3d6txz,ItoldonAnneFrank,4,Tue Jul 14 03:57:06 2015 UTC,"This was solid. In a vacuum, we are easily a playoff team in the East, in the idea that we only need 38-41 wins. Toronto I still see as a team in the playoffs, especially with their big offseason. Milwaukee will progress IMO, I can only see their big man defense being their biggest flaw. Maybe shooting too.   I still have a ton of faith in Detroit, with healthy guys and SVG.  But yeah, I agree, there is a good chance for us. I still say we are a 7 or 8 seed, but we will see."
OrlandoMagic,3d6txz,EyeoftheTyga,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:00:15 2015 UTC,"And you didn't even mention the Knicks.  They added Afflalo, KOQ, Derrick Williams, got RoLo to anchor their D, drafted Porzingis (who this sub was absolutely in love with) AND they're getting Carmelo Anthony back.  They'll be in contention for a low seed too.  It's not gonna be easy for us to make the playoffs next year.  Not saying we can't do it, but it's not exactly a foregone conclusion."
OrlandoMagic,3d6txz,shiggidyschwag,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:14:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Pacers will end up as good as some people think. They lost West, Hibbert, and Stephenson. We do not know how good Paul George will be after that ACL tear. He may not be the same as he was a few years ago. They are not the same team. At the most, I think they will compete for the 8th spot, but they are definitely not a lock for the playoffs. I wouldn't be surprised if they miss the playoffs"
OrlandoMagic,3d6txz,onlysame1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:17:34 2015 UTC,Im hoping Toronto falls. I hate to say it but they might crash
OrlandoMagic,3d6txz,VictorOladeepthroat,5,Tue Jul 14 06:58:06 2015 UTC,It's glad to be getting some sort of recognition. Alot of things have to go well for us if we want to be a playoff team but I feel as if our depth will be able to carry us.   The X-Factor this season in my opinion is Payton. If he can play in that March-April form then we have a great shot at the playoffs.
OrlandoMagic,3d6txz,mjridiculouz,3,Tue Jul 14 01:35:58 2015 UTC,"I'd say the X-Factor is our defense and coach Skiles.  We're going into next season with basically the exact same roster as last year.  Ya know, when we won 25 games.  A few extra ppg from Hezonja isn't going to make a big difference if we can't coherently defend.  We did nothing to address our interior defense, so I guess we're hoping Vucevic can be saved by a new coach / scheme."
OrlandoMagic,3d6txz,shiggidyschwag,3,Tue Jul 14 14:09:06 2015 UTC,"I'm cautiously optimistic but I think it's going to take another bad year for the east overall for us to get in. I don't think we're a .500 ball club.  Hopefully Skiles gets Oladipo and Payton on track defensively. On ball they are both ok, but off ball they have been bad, Oladipo especially. I still don't see us climbing out of the bottom 10 on offense, but hopefully we make big strides on D to at least the top half of the league."
OrlandoMagic,3d6txz,jive_turkey,3,Tue Jul 14 12:56:56 2015 UTC,"I think Magic fans who are expecting Orlando to make the playoffs are in for a rude awakening. This team is still too young and inexperienced. It isn't like they were on the cusp and a new coach will be able to push them in. They were downright bad, and they need to learn how to play successful team basketball. That is going to take time and patience. This is a 32-37 win team"
OrlandoMagic,3d6txz,Ellimistopher,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:38:40 2015 UTC,"I'm just hoping for a dependable rotation and a team identity we as fans can hang our hats on. The East is going to be tough, and Orlando still has some growing pains before we mature."

OrlandoMagic,3d9ntr,Swish28,-8,Tue Jul 14 16:50:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe the current front office should try to change the franchise, and I'm not sure these stretch 4s are going to help us improve"
OrlandoMagic,3d9ntr,rockinwithmycockout,10,Tue Jul 14 17:46:40 2015 UTC,"Man, you'd think he was the second coming of Tyronne Lue with way we talk bad about this guy.   He put up respectable numbers, and hustles and gives it his all. Yea, he's not the most talented in the world, but after missing out on Milsap we weren't going to get an all star anyway.   We need guys that can come in and play 10-15 minutes a game and have there not be a drop off. This guy fills that role. He's not going to start. Plus it's only a 1 year contract cheap contract. It allows us to be aggressive again next offseason and go after another Milsap-level FA.   Who else would you rather see us sign?"
OrlandoMagic,3d9ntr,HokieinFL28,6,Tue Jul 14 17:02:21 2015 UTC,Lol if you watched when he played up he took Frye and sometimes Vuc out back and whooped that ass. The guy plays defense unlike Frye and can block some shots while having one of the best mid range jump shoots for a PF
OrlandoMagic,3d9ntr,houseQM,7,Tue Jul 14 17:04:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, he'll be a guy who gets cleanup minutes behind the 4 and 5 spots. He'll also be the guy who can steal minutes away from more talented, but less hard-working guys and get a better rotation spot."
OrlandoMagic,3d9ntr,ChickenCaseyDillas,7,Tue Jul 14 17:08:04 2015 UTC,Go on Youtube and watch him drop 25 pts on us and then tell us he has no talent.
OrlandoMagic,3d9ntr,rockinwithmycockout,-7,Tue Jul 14 17:26:53 2015 UTC,"Omg, a very mediocre player put up a career game against the magic last year... Once.  I recall most in this sub liking the frye signing last year, except me. When you've been a Magic fan since their first game, it's hard to get excited about bench player FA signings because the magic have stumbled so many times"
OrlandoMagic,3d9ntr,ItoldonAnneFrank,3,Tue Jul 14 17:43:30 2015 UTC,"Man, if you hate the team and their signings so much, why bother making a post about this? There's really no reason to be upset by this signing. He plays D (something Vuc and Frye both don't do), and he's on a cheap 1 year contract. He hasn't made an 8 year career by being mediocre. No one is saying he's an allstar.   He's not the missing piece that we need to get in the playoffs, and no one is expecting him to be. We've built this team through the draft. We have a good but not yet complete core. We're more than one piece away from having the puzzle built, and a guy signed to a small year deal isn't going to mean anything next season. This is a win/win.   If anything, he's going to cut into Frye's playing time, which someone who was against the Frye signing should be thrilled about it."
OrlandoMagic,3d9ntr,thenotoriouscliff,3,Tue Jul 14 19:01:58 2015 UTC,"The amount this sub shits on Frye is ridiculous. The man shot 39 percent from 3 last year. That's elite. He's still a legit NBA weapon when used correctly, and don't cite his contract because money means nothing to us at this point. We're below the cap floor."

OrlandoMagic,3d9ntr,ConvertsToMetric,3,Thu Jul 16 11:03:14 2015 UTC,"He's no star, but Jason Smith is a big bodied, hustle player on defense who will contest all shots at the rim. He's also an elite midrange jump shooter.   In the 10-14 ft range and 15-19 ft range last year he shot comparable percentages to people such as Dirk, Vucevic, and Kyrie. To say he's not talented shows complete ignorance on your part.   He's a roster filler for sure, but he brings some valuable aspects to his game."

OrlandoMagic,3d4xzk,bk10287,3,Mon Jul 13 19:49:01 2015 UTC,:(   :(
OrlandoMagic,3d4xzk,dev1359,5,Mon Jul 13 21:37:19 2015 UTC,"This is sad for me, but I'll always love Jameer.  He was a solid PG his entire time in Orlando, and did great things for the organization.  I just read over his Wiki page, and its worth a quick read.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameer_Nelson#Orlando_Magic_.282004.E2.80.932014.29  Also here's a 7 second clip of my favorite Jameer moment ever.  I was really getting into the Magic around the time we got him in the draft.  Was hoping to get to see him on the team again though, but I'll root for the Nuggets in the West.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OuQCHZgi2U"
OrlandoMagic,3d57zc,Woodsoot,7,Mon Jul 13 16:55:14 2015 UTC,"Was just about to post something similar. Finally glad that we don't owe any more picks. Also, we need to pay attention to the LA-PHI situation:  2018 first round draft pick from L.A. Lakers If at least two years after the L.A. Lakers conveyed a 1st round pick to Philadelphia, then the L.A. Lakers' 1st round pick to Orlando protected for selections 1-5 in 2018 and unprotected in 2019; if the L.A. Lakers have not conveyed a 1st round pick to Philadelphia by 2017, then the L.A. Lakers will instead convey their 2017 2nd round pick and 2018 2nd round pick to Orlando  We need to be rooting for Philly to take the Lakers pick next year, which 1-3 protected. If Philly gets their pick next year, then we get a 1-5 protected first rounder in 2018, after Kobe retires. That has potential to be a really good pick."
OrlandoMagic,3d57zc,whtge8,2,Mon Jul 13 17:01:43 2015 UTC,"Kobe already said he's retiring after this season, not 2018."
OrlandoMagic,3d57zc,blinkz,3,Mon Jul 13 17:37:13 2015 UTC,"Right. Just meant that Kobe will have already retired and they should be pretty bad. They don't have many young assets besides Russell and Randle, and will likely lose their first this year."
OrlandoMagic,3d57zc,whtge8,2,Mon Jul 13 17:38:49 2015 UTC,Oh. gotcha. I misread it.
OrlandoMagic,3d57zc,blinkz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:41:21 2015 UTC,"No way Lakers make the playoffs this year. Philly will get the pick. That means we're pretty much locked in for 2018 or 2019. I could see the Lakers being bad for 3 more seasons. Not sold on Randle, and Russell looks like he need a lot of work at the NBA level."
OrlandoMagic,3d57zc,ItoldonAnneFrank,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:07:04 2015 UTC,Lakers don't have to make the playoffs. It's just protected 1-3. If LA lands any of those picks then they keep it.
OrlandoMagic,3d57zc,whtge8,2,Wed Jul 15 21:08:52 2015 UTC,So if they Lakers don't get a top 3 pick next year we get their 2018 1st protected/2019 unprotected?
OrlandoMagic,3d57zc,bk10287,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:22:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly! (And just to specify, it's 1-5 protected in 2018)."

OrlandoMagic,3d57zc,MelbourneFL321,2,Mon Jul 13 21:54:18 2015 UTC,"Big deal, we are moving into phase 2, no longer acquiring plain assets,  but building a competitive team. It is unlikely that 2nd rounder contributes much"
OrlandoMagic,3d57zc,whiplash588,3,Tue Jul 14 02:09:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but not if you're a Magic and Blazers fan :("
OrlandoMagic,3d4lbo,mjridiculouz,12,Mon Jul 13 14:01:23 2015 UTC,Great point on Marble over Harkless. That makes a ton of sense and I think he will make the most out his situation. Best of luck to Harkless but I think it was the right move.
OrlandoMagic,3d4lbo,alan4884,8,Mon Jul 13 14:20:02 2015 UTC,"Might be a move to clear room to sign Quincy Acy. We tried to trade Harkless for him at the deadline and there were reports we were still interested last month.  I just hope it isn't to bring back Willie Green. I don't mind him as a 3rd stringer and good locker room guy, but coaches love him and tend to play him more than he should. I don't think it would be any different with Skiles as he loves players who hustle and play defense."
OrlandoMagic,3d4lbo,REEB,6,Mon Jul 13 14:25:11 2015 UTC,That's what i'm mostly expecting with this move.   Edit: OKAY I MEANT THE ACY MOVE NOT GREEN DEAR LORD PLEASE NO WILLIE
OrlandoMagic,3d4lbo,REEB,3,Mon Jul 13 14:26:30 2015 UTC,"lol Green is still a free agent and a Magic blogger pointed out how Oladipo's farewell tweet to departed teammates included everyone (BG, KOQ, Hark, Ridnour) except Willie... as if he's expected back or there's at least a possibility still."
OrlandoMagic,3d4lbo,ajax0626,3,Mon Jul 13 14:44:02 2015 UTC,I think we're done in FA.
OrlandoMagic,3d4lbo,whtge8,3,Mon Jul 13 14:35:47 2015 UTC,"I don't really think it's a choice of Marble over Harkless, more like Hezonja over Harkless. With Harris starting then there just isn't really enough room for both Hezonja and Harkless at the 3. Also Moe and KOQ were great for the locker room, and they were all pretty close, but it happens. We really need to look at Oladipo, Harris, and Vucevic to lead this team both on the court and the locker room.  If they want to bring Green back that's fine. Last year we didn't really have a backup PG. I doubt he would get any playing time with Watson there."
OrlandoMagic,3d4lbo,rcognition,2,Mon Jul 13 14:36:44 2015 UTC,We gave this kid like 4000 minutes to develop and he did absolutely nothing with it.  Time to move on.  Our chemistry might appear good but its doing us no good.    Sometimes you work harder when you're not goofing around with your friends. It's time for our kids to become grown men.
OrlandoMagic,3d4lbo,fivecardstud14,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:11:10 2015 UTC,"Marble looks good in summer league, already carries himself like a vet.  I would like to see him get more minutes this upcoming season, as Skiles should like what he brings to the team defensively.  He's not the best shooter but is smart and knows what to do/where to be offensively."
OrlandoMagic,3d4lbo,mufcreddevil7,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:26:20 2015 UTC,"Which gives Hennigan enough space to sign Tyler Harvey if he wants and another player, whether it's a player that stood out to him in Summer League or it's another FA since we have about 4ish million worth of salary cap left.

OrlandoMagic,3d24js,danielsilva12345,9,Sun Jul 12 22:24:42 2015 UTC,"Everyone has been saying ""he will break out"" but going 10-56 from 3 pt last year was brutal as a potential 3 and D guy"
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,CricketJohnny,7,Sun Jul 12 22:29:02 2015 UTC,His form was so robotic... I don't even know how he shot 38% from 3 the previous year.
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,REEB,3,Sun Jul 12 23:51:58 2015 UTC,"As a portland fan i'm glad to know the sample size was THAT low. I'm glad we got him because we dont have much else but I'm not to high on this trade, he'll be 2nd or 3rd off a tanking team so WHATEVER"
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,SKHRAEURPL,10,Mon Jul 13 00:34:18 2015 UTC,I knew Harkless would be traded when he did this.

OrlandoMagic,3d24js,rtillaree,7,Sun Jul 12 22:33:24 2015 UTC,Andrew Nicholson is now our longest tenured player :( good luck to moe I hope he reaches his full potential.
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,ninety4kid,2,Sun Jul 12 22:33:36 2015 UTC,Not Vucevic?
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,EyeoftheTyga,7,Sun Jul 12 22:45:26 2015 UTC,Technically it's Nicholson because he was drafted to the team before Vuc was traded. They both started on the Magic in the same season though if I remember correctly.
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,radardog95,2,Sun Jul 12 22:53:24 2015 UTC,Not sure how you'd debate it but I guess both then. They came to us the same year Nicholson in the draft and Vuc through the trade.
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,ninety4kid,6,Sun Jul 12 22:54:23 2015 UTC,"I'm actually fine with this. More PT for super Mario. + I never thought Harkless had much upside, there's plenty of players that serve the same role as his but play the game better. I'll take a 2nd."
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,xiedian,5,Sun Jul 12 23:08:50 2015 UTC,NOOOOOOOO!!!!   That's all though? Seemed like we could've got more. Not saying he's a great trade asset but he is still young and a good defender.
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,eldonhorvito,8,Sun Jul 12 22:28:31 2015 UTC,"Meh, not sure the rest of the league felt the same way about him as we did. Three years in the league and he has yet to impress. But now we have an extra roster spot, maybe someone made a lasting impression to management in Summer League."
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,radardog95,3,Sun Jul 12 22:35:47 2015 UTC,His value was at an all time low and we wouldn't have been able to raise it. Better to trade him now since he's likely to sign elsewhere as a restricted free agent next summer
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,REEB,3,Sun Jul 12 23:50:15 2015 UTC,:(
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,inbar17,5,Sun Jul 12 22:28:17 2015 UTC,Is it possible to be pissed off and be happy about a trade?
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,OrlMagicfan1334,3,Sun Jul 12 22:45:45 2015 UTC,"It was needed, he needs a fresh start and we rather give minutes to Mario. I always had high hopes for him coming into every season but he was really inconsistent, with that being said, good luck Moe!"
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,PeroPej,3,Sun Jul 12 22:31:40 2015 UTC,Took this pic of Harkless at the first Wizards game last year. Wish him the best!
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,Doctor_Fiber,2,Mon Jul 13 02:48:22 2015 UTC,"He would never have seen playing time anyway. Good luck but as soon as we got Mario, Harkless was already told to pack his bags"
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,onlysame1,5,Mon Jul 13 15:45:20 2015 UTC,Good luck in Portland Moe! Too bad he didn't get a chance to prove himself in Orlando. A 2nd rounder was probably about right for him.
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,radardog95,15,Sun Jul 12 22:31:09 2015 UTC,"Didnt get a chance to prove himself? He walked into the starting role his first year here. Then he had a chance to be a solid bench guy, then was reported last year to be out of shape and form during the ASB.   He had plenty of time and regressed last year. Now that he has yet another guy in Hezonja in front of him, he wasn't going to play at all.  We honestly did him a favor here."
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,jive_turkey,4,Sun Jul 12 23:08:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I wish him well in Portland, but you're right. He had every opportunity to prove himself in Orlando and just didn't. I was really hoping he'd get some experience in international play last off season or the one before, I forget which, but he didn't play. He has the talent but it doesn't seem like he has the drive or the confidence to put it together. I'd like to see him do well in Portland but I don't think this is a bad trade for us. Obviously he isn't worth as much as we thought he was seeing as we only got a 2nd rounder for him."
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,jarkarawr,3,Sun Jul 12 23:40:55 2015 UTC,"He walked into the starting role his first year here.   he started just as much the following year, too"
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,REEB,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:21:13 2015 UTC,Most players seemed to regress last season. Coaching changes and lack of direction tend to do that do a franchise. I really hope Skiles brings it all together and gives the team a defined defensive personality. Hoping for a team similar to the 2000's Pistons.
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,MagicN3rd,3,Mon Jul 13 19:55:47 2015 UTC,He proved himself to be exactly the type of player he is...
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,sleazlybeasly,2,Sun Jul 12 23:09:11 2015 UTC,Why? What's the point?
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,stinx2001,6,Sun Jul 12 22:32:19 2015 UTC,"Clears up room. These guys can play the same position:  Gordon, Harris, Harkless, Hezonja, Marble, and maybe Fournier. Someone had to go, and keeping him on the bench is a waste"
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,EyeoftheTyga,2,Sun Jul 12 22:45:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess that does make sense.
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,stinx2001,3,Sun Jul 12 22:48:04 2015 UTC,What's the point in keeping him
OrlandoMagic,3d24js,sleazlybeasly,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:10:23 2015 UTC,It will save the team $4 million next year on a player who would never play.

OrlandoMagic,3d24js,thenotoriouscliff,3,Mon Jul 13 00:20:38 2015 UTC,Yup. Don't love that at all. KOQ is one thing but Harkness is under contract and it's a good deal

OrlandoMagic,3cwyv0,NickRosCRO,14,Sat Jul 11 14:37:44 2015 UTC,"I love how so many people overlooked him because of baseless rumors that he was a locker room cancer. All his teammates in Europe loved him, and I don't see why it would be any different here.  Now, his opponents will probably despise him, but that's more of a positive. We need some fiery competitiveness."
OrlandoMagic,3cwyv0,VanceIX,6,Sat Jul 11 16:13:29 2015 UTC,i always laugh at comparisions to jr smith. i spent so much time arguing with dumbasses saying to me that he's a locker room cancer and he's a chucker. dude had multiple people saying opposite things and not a single one confirming the 'reports'. mario was point guard just few years ago.
OrlandoMagic,3cwyv0,whtge8,3,Sat Jul 11 17:05:58 2015 UTC,The thing is that he also has a very similar game to JR Smith. I don't think they are comparing his attitude all the time.
OrlandoMagic,3cwyv0,whtge8,8,Sat Jul 11 17:07:26 2015 UTC,"i don't really see the similarity other than shooting stroke and athleticism. mario tries hard on defense, he is unselfish, can rebound and doesn't put up dumb shots just because."
OrlandoMagic,3cwyv0,thug_life4,3,Sat Jul 11 17:23:52 2015 UTC,JR Smith is actually a pretty good defender. Haven't seen too much of Mario against NBA level talent so I am still not sure what to expect from him defensively. Smith is a good player but is just plain dumb. Hezonja will be much better. I think Hezonjas game is a little closer to Chandler Parsons. Nice size and athleticism with a decent shooting stroke. Parsons is also a decent passer and defender. Maybe a little Rudy Gay too?
OrlandoMagic,3cwyv0,Big_Apple3AM,6,Sat Jul 11 17:27:53 2015 UTC,"JR is extremely inconsistent defensively. he's good when he wants to be, which isn't very often usually."

OrlandoMagic,3cy8ks,thenotoriouscliff,26,Sat Jul 11 21:26:00 2015 UTC,Are we really comparing Mario to Kevin Durant already???
OrlandoMagic,3cy8ks,dexmex223,8,Sun Jul 12 02:31:15 2015 UTC,"Length is the big difference. But yes, their play style is similar."
OrlandoMagic,3cy8ks,primetime_,5,Sun Jul 12 00:15:16 2015 UTC,KD also played a lot of SG in his rookie year.
OrlandoMagic,3cy8ks,UpvotesArePeople,9,Sun Jul 12 00:29:22 2015 UTC,"KD has a bit more length, so he can get his shot up over a lot of guys. But I could see the comparison."
OrlandoMagic,3cy8ks,eeyore26,2,Sat Jul 11 22:36:55 2015 UTC,"Physically, Kevin Durant is a couple of inches taller and longer. In Kevin's year at Texas as an eighteen year old he was more efficient from the floor than Hezonja, and quite a bit better three-point shooter. Hezonja is a better passer now than Durant was, but Durant was a vastly superior rebounder. The biggest difference, and the thing that worries me most about Hezonja, is drawing fouls and committing fouls. Hezonja averaged 1.6 free throw attempts per 36 minutes in Europe, which is absolutely terrible. I mean just awful. Durant averaged 8.2 per 40 at Texas. Hezonja committed almost twice as many fouls as he drew, which is really worrisome. Hopefully this is a point of emphasis for the Magic's staff. As much as I hope Hezonja succeeds, eighteen year old Kevin Durant was a much, much better player than nineteen year old Mario Hezonja."
OrlandoMagic,3cy8ks,rope09,2,Sun Jul 12 05:45:26 2015 UTC,I get your point but you cant be serious comparing college basketball with spanish league and euroleague. If hezonja accepted Kentucky offer he would have ridicolous stats. I mean i dont think he would be better then Durant. I dont think he has celling as Durant at all. But please dont compare college basketball with spanish league.
OrlandoMagic,3cy8ks,eeyore26,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:49:55 2015 UTC,"I certainly understand your sentiment, and it definitely has merit, but I don't think the difference is as drastic as you make it out to be. Durant was the best player in the country, and was keyed in on by every team he played against, resulting in the entire game plan being formulated around stopping him. Hezonja was playing low volume minutes against second and third units for a substantial percentage of his time in the Spanish league. Regardless of the opposition, I guess the point is that the only discernible basketball skill that current Hezonja is better at than eighteen year old Durant was is a slight edge in passing."
OrlandoMagic,3cy8ks,zrinjskimostar,2,Sun Jul 12 18:25:46 2015 UTC,"i believe difference between european and college basketball is much bigger than you think if you followed both and i'm talking about style. i'd suggest to search for other player's stats in terms of drawing fouls and you'll see massive difference, simply because in europe they don't go that much at the basket. it's nothing about players itself (in most of cases), rather style of basketball being played in euroleague. they are much more concentrated on quick ball movement and finding an open man rather than having some player attacking the rim alone."
OrlandoMagic,3cy8ks,eeyore26,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:29:22 2015 UTC,"While this is true, I'm pretty sure that the differences in the game go without saying. 1.6 free throw attempts per 36 minutes is very bad in Liga ACB, but it would be almost impossibly bad in the NCAA game. Just for reference, Andy Panko, the man who led Liga ACB in FTA this season, had nearly 7 attempts per 36. Regardless of the league, 1.6 is alarming. This also doesn't explain the high rate at which Hezonja fouls opponents."

OrlandoMagic,3cy8ks,Ellimistopher,2,Mon Jul 13 08:10:45 2015 UTC,"Length, Height, I really can't compare playing style, but my guess is that they would have obvious differences if analyzed in depth.  I mean it isn't even close, Durant is at least 2 inches taller, and has a wingspan of nearly half a foot longer.  Durant was absoutely killing it at the college level, while Hezonja was riding the bench overseas."

OrlandoMagic,3cy8ks,zrinjskimostar,2,Mon Jul 13 20:21:43 2015 UTC,you can't conclude that from pictures. i sometimes look taller than my brother on pictures despite being smaller 2 inches.

OrlandoMagic,3cy8ks,zrinjskimostar,2,Mon Jul 13 20:45:59 2015 UTC,"fcuk. hezonja is 6'8'' without shoes, so he goes up to 6'9'' probably (he looked bit taller than gordon in videos), however durant definitely isn't listed correctly, he is at least 6'11''. hezonja would be quite tall for shooting guard if coach puts him there occasionally and i don't see reason why not. he is great shooter, athletic and quite quick (and not only for his height)."

OrlandoMagic,3cznje,Ellimistopher,15,Sun Jul 12 07:27:04 2015 UTC,Gordon was going #5 if we didn't pick him. And no.
OrlandoMagic,3cznje,Kaiiu,7,Sun Jul 12 06:21:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, anyone paying attention to Utah's thinking saw the writing on the wall that they were going with Gordon. We threw them a curve ball by selecting him instead of Exum."
OrlandoMagic,3cznje,Ellimistopher,5,Sun Jul 12 07:40:44 2015 UTC,Boston wanted him as well.
OrlandoMagic,3cznje,REEB,9,Sun Jul 12 13:45:16 2015 UTC,"Smart is extremely similar to Oladipo, he doesn't compliment him at all. Streaky shooting combo who's best at attacking the rim and drawing fouls. Payton is way more of a true PG."
OrlandoMagic,3cznje,clown613,2,Sun Jul 12 06:49:30 2015 UTC,"What's the one weakness of Elfrid's game? His shooting.   FG% - Payton 43.5%, Smart 41% 3P% - Payton 26.2%, Smart 33.5%   and while the 3P% is a win for Smart, check out FG% by distance:   Payton: 51.5% from 0-3 ft, 37.6% from 3-10 ft, 32.9% from 10-16 ft, and 34.5% from 16 ft to just inside the 3-point line Smart: 56.0% from 0-3 ft, 25.6% from 3-10 ft, 38.2% from 10-16 ft, and 29.5% from 16 ft to just inside the 3-point line   What you're seeing is a significant difference at the rim, where Smart is the bigger player and stronger finisher, but some serious inconsistency in Smart's mid-range game and perimeter game. While Payton's shooting percentage doesn't go below 32.9% (basically makes 1 out of 3) until he reaches the 3-point line, Smart only makes a quarter of his attempts from 3 to 10 feet away from the basket, which would indicate erratic shooting attempts in traffic, and he makes 5 percent fewer of his attempts from 16 ft out than Payton.  Those numbers are definitely not conclusive for any argument that Smart is a better shooter, and they're definitely not enough of a plus (particularly not even being as good a 3-point threat as Oladipo) to compensate for other areas:   Assists - Payton 6.5, Smart 3.1 Steals - Payton 1.7, Smart 1.5 Rebounds - Payton 4.3, Smart 3.3   Plain and simple, Payton is a significantly better point guard and there should be no question now that the was the better pick over Smart."
OrlandoMagic,3cznje,mufcreddevil7,9,Thu Jul 16 13:51:46 2015 UTC,"No. We needed a good PG and we got one. 11 pts, 8.3 ast, 5.4 reb, 2.1 stl post all star break. AG wouldn't have been available late lottery either. Also, Smart is not a PG at the NBA level. He's a defensive SG with a chucking mentality. Payton is a better compliment to Oladipo and the rest of the team.   I think what OP needs is a reminder of what Payton can do...  Rookie year highlights  Part 2  Oh, and Payton owned Smart in head to head matchups last season...   Payton: 17 pts on 47.6% fg, 7.7 ast, 5.3 reb, 1.3 stl   Smart: 8.7 pts on 33.3% fg, 2 ast, 4.3 reb, 1.7 stl (and 1 ejection lol)"
OrlandoMagic,3cznje,REEB,4,Sun Jul 12 14:19:02 2015 UTC,"Heck no. But I am a believer of having a ""true"" Point Guard as your PG. Guys like Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, and Chris Paul. Basically pass first Point Guards who score if necessary are the best type of PG to get imo and I feel as if Elfrid Payton has more of that in him than Marcus Smart."
OrlandoMagic,3cznje,mjridiculouz,0,Sun Jul 12 13:05:22 2015 UTC,"none of those 3 guys were able to lead their team to a championship. kidd only has a ring from piggy backing a contender shortly before retiring. this has become a guard league, even cp3 trails blake griffin very closely in field goal attempts"
OrlandoMagic,3cznje,bumbleb333,3,Mon Jul 13 20:33:41 2015 UTC,"Payton is undoubtedly better than Smart after one season.   Assist to turnover ratio is 2.65 to 2.27 in Elfrid's favor, which is obviously a big difference. Payton also has a big lead in free throw rate, at .302 to .266. Payton even has a slight lead in defensive metrics, with 2.3 defensive win shares compared to Smart's 2.2, and a 2.9% steal percentage to Smart's 2.7%. Elfrid does all of this while still managing to foul less than Smart, (2.8 to 3.5 personal fouls per 36 minutes respectively). For what it's worth, Payton also beats out Smart in rebounding percentage. Keep in mind, Payton was superior to Smart in all of these categories while somehow being surrounded by teammates that finished 15(!) wins less talented. (Celtics were 40-42 while the Magic finished 25-57.) They're both bad three point shooters, but Smart attempted exactly nine times the amount of three pointers per 36 minutes that Elfrid did (5.4 to 0.6). All of those threes that Smart jacks up and misses effectively negates his advantage in three point percentage. In terms of two point field goals, once again, Payton wins. .435% to .410%.   Basically, Payton is way better at everything but three point shooting, which doesn't really matter, since Smart takes way more threes than he should be taking anyway. In terms of size, they're both 6'4"", and both had a 36 inch vertical at the combine.   To be honest, I can't think of any reason that anyone involved in basketball would ever want Smart over Payton. To top it all off, Payton also has way better hair and is far better looking than Smart xD"

Edit: format"
OrlandoMagic,3cznje,itryitryitry,10,Sun Jul 12 08:25:05 2015 UTC,"Smart is a better 3pt shooter, but it doesn't mean he is a good 3pt shooter. He chucked his way through the season last year at below average 3pt percentage. He also refused to drive to the basket. Btw, Payton is actually slightly taller. Smart is a better SG, Payton is a better PG.    Payton was a steal where we got him but I think Smart is and will be the better player.   ""We"" ~ get out of here, you're not a Magic fan.

OrlandoMagic,3cu5rz,JustBreathe69,7,Fri Jul 10 20:18:31 2015 UTC,"Nice job  Disagree on MCW though. He didn't make many strides in Philly, but after he got settled in Milwaukee, he finished out the season really strong, raising his FG% and lowering his turnovers. He's a 6'6 PG with length and decent quickness. After MCW develops a good outside shot, he'll be really good. Think Shaun Livingston with a shot. Oladipo improved more than MCW, but to say MCW didn't make strides his 2nd year is kinda foolish IMO"
OrlandoMagic,3cu5rz,Big_Apple3AM,6,Fri Jul 10 20:35:48 2015 UTC,I've never been a fan of MCW. His shooting got worse last year and true he is a good defender because of his length but I think his shooting and turnover rate is too big of a liability
OrlandoMagic,3cu5rz,Big_Apple3AM,3,Fri Jul 10 22:24:57 2015 UTC,"Turnover rate when down a bit when moving to Milwaukee and FG% was 50% in April (small 8 game sample size, but it's due to an offensive change to something he's more comfortable in). Still he improved to 42% when going to MIL  His fg% and turnover rate was so high being in Phillys high paced offense. Milwaukee fits him better, and he's okay with 2-3 turnovers there."
OrlandoMagic,3cu5rz,twjohns97,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"Shooting is a problem, but the turnovers had a lot to do with being tasked with carrying that team. His rookie year, the team's best player, Nerlens Noel, sat out with injury, and he was left to carry the team. His second year, Nerlens returned but started slow offensively, and the team didn't fix the overall lack of talent around him. He was traded midseason and showed signs of improvement, which will only continue as Milwaukee gets better with Jabari Parker returning and Greg Monroe coming. It's all about the situation."
OrlandoMagic,3cu5rz,IamtheQuestionMaster,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:47:09 2015 UTC,"I agree, his shot is awful. I'm not sure why the other guy assumes it will just get better. A lot of point guards do improve their jumper, MCW won't make strides in my opinion. I don't know that Peyton's will either."
OrlandoMagic,3cu5rz,mjridiculouz,7,Sat Jul 18 23:39:23 2015 UTC,"Some controversial stuff in this post imo.  Vucevic is much better than a ""solid midrange shooter"" in my opinion off of eye test. It felt like he was automatic from there up until March where it just looked like Vucevic gave up on the season and who could blame him?   Oladipo was not a good defender this year for Orlando. He got beat by his man way too many times and always lost his man due to him playing too much help defense. I think this can be adjusted of course and might have just been our defensive schemes that didn't benefit him or he's just being too aggressive on defense but i'm sure he will improve on it, he's just not as great of a defender as people make him out to be because they haven't really watched us enough to know this problem like us Magic fans who consistently watch.  Only problem with the whole Harris thing is calling his contract a ""steal"" which I mean it will all depend on what contracts look like in 2 years but I think you needed to mention his injury history since he's always having problems with his ankles/knees and sitting games for us often (bout a dozen or more probably)  Fournier is a good defender. Heck i'll say he was better than Oladipo this year and plus he's not just a shooter as he can work well with the ball in his hands and he drives into the paint and finishes better than Oladipo in my opinion and draws more contact. Problem with Fournier is that there has been many times this year where it seems like nobody wants to give him the ball on offense which bothers me since he is a very underrated player.  Gordon you were fine with.  Payton you were fine with. I really don't like the Rondo comparisons but i'm sure i'm one of the few people who don't like it so I can't really argue with you because I understand where everybody is coming from, but just because he's a playermaker that can't shoot doesn't mean he's Rondo.  Can't say anything about Hezonja since he hasn't played.  Overall I think it was a good blog post if it was one of your first. Very standard in terms of opinion but still fine. I would say though to correct a couple of things like Redick's last name and Elfrid Payton was the 10th pick not the 12th. Little nit picky stuff like that tends to bother me and I don't know if i'm the only one with that but yeah overall it was fine."
OrlandoMagic,3cu5rz,mjridiculouz,5,Fri Jul 10 21:55:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input. It is indeed one of my first posts (6th I think.)  I was under the impression that Oladipo was a good defender? Or is he just athletic with potential to become a good defender
OrlandoMagic,3cu5rz,johnkphotos,6,Fri Jul 10 22:20:44 2015 UTC,He was a great defender in college but it hasn't exactly transitioned into the NBA just yet. He over helps on defense way too much and ends up losing his man. And when he does get to his man his feet aren't set so his man blows by him most of the time.

OrlandoMagic,3cte9b,mufcreddevil7,2,Fri Jul 10 18:38:23 2015 UTC,"Compression sleeves are often about blood vessels, which even in limbs can significantly impact overall health & well-being of other areas of the body. If his doctor felt there was a cardiovascular weakness in his lower left leg, he would consider that as a potential catalyst for many things, including possibly his knee and/or back problems.  Then again, it could have simply been a stylistic choice.

OrlandoMagic,3cpf3y,CaptainBananaFish,6,Thu Jul 9 18:37:18 2015 UTC,"Depends how much Gordon has bulked up. He has the same standing reach as Draymond and obvious advantages in athleticism, so the ability to hold up against stronger guys is the only question.  Then again, unless you're just looking to throw a curveball here and there, there's not really an advantage to taking Vuc out of the game unless you're getting smoked on defense and need more speed. Most teams go small for offense."
OrlandoMagic,3cpf3y,Viol33,6,Thu Jul 9 19:12:33 2015 UTC,I think its an awesome idea but pretty much all of those guys need to improve their 3 pt shooting to help its effectiveness... Definitely should experiment with small ball lineups like this and see what happens... Maybe fournier in for elfrid would help too
OrlandoMagic,3cpf3y,bk10287,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:43:59 2015 UTC,Yeah it would really only work with Fournier in for Elfrid. Even then it'd still be a questionable lineup
OrlandoMagic,3cpf3y,Big_Apple3AM,3,Fri Jul 10 02:28:27 2015 UTC,There was at least one game last season (possibly a late season Celtics game?) where we ran with Gordon as our center for an extended period.

Payton P&R with Gordon w Hezonja and Oladipo spotting up and Harris spotting up or cutting or him rolling with Gordon spotting up in mid range sounds dangerously good.
OrlandoMagic,3cpf3y,Hootchy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:18:58 2015 UTC,"Could work for a stretch..maybe.  Well, our best lineup would be, what?   Payton/Oladipo/Harris/Gordon/Vuc? Or Payton/Oladipo/Hezonja/Harris/Vuc?"
OrlandoMagic,3cpf3y,xzp99,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:51:59 2015 UTC,"I could see it possibly more from the Gordon side than the Harris side. Green is a monster physically, and Harrison Barnes is a far more physical rebounder & defender than Harris. Even AI is a reasonably physical presence. I don't know that it couldn't work, per se, but we'd need to see more from Harris inside to make that work."

My favorite aspect of this team now is just how high-character every player we've added has been, and because the Magic purposely went after these kinds of players, the result is an incredibly close-knit group of team-first, hard-working young players with immense room to develop.  Honestly, even with the 50+ teams in the Dwight era, the team chemistry wasn't even close to what these young guys have now from what I can tell. The players on today's Magic truly seem to want the best for each other. KOQ's goodbye statement to Orlando is a perfect example"
OrlandoMagic,3conjc,thevadster,8,Thu Jul 9 15:57:20 2015 UTC,"at the end of the day, in the past 3 years dwight has won just as many finals as the magic. that keeps me sane and happy"
OrlandoMagic,3conjc,thug_life4,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:24:39 2015 UTC,"A reboot was necessary and Dwight seems to be falling apart physically. Howard leaving may have been a blessing, to be honest. The team would not have gone through their overhaul if Dwight re-signed.   Stan Van Gundy was a remarkable coach, and the second best in the Magic's history, in my opinion, just behind Chuck Daly, but the guy leaves a lot to be desired as a front office guy. Signing Aron Baynes and Reggie Jackson for a combined $100 million is beyond stupid, and they still need to lock Drummond up. Orlando may have dodged a bullet with Van Gundy, too, as bad as that may sound right now."
OrlandoMagic,3conjc,bizort,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:24:04 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, Orlando has always been about high character types.  I want to say it's something ownership has always pushed for."
OrlandoMagic,3conjc,spaceheatr,7,Sat Jul 11 04:56:41 2015 UTC,All we gotta do now is hope these guys stick together and don't leave us as free agents.
OrlandoMagic,3conjc,SamuelMuniz,6,Thu Jul 9 16:38:22 2015 UTC,"Best thing is, other than Vuc and Harris who got big contracts in the past 2 off-seasons, these guys are going to be restricted free agents (except Dedmon) so we will be able to match any offer. Hopefully no one offers them a Chandler Parsons-like over inflated contract that our front office can't reasonably match."
OrlandoMagic,3conjc,thevadster,3,Thu Jul 9 17:34:19 2015 UTC,That's why you dont wait for another team to give them a contract just because you will match.
OrlandoMagic,3conjc,thevadster,3,Thu Jul 9 17:57:44 2015 UTC,"Definitely, but its not always the team's choice. If a player wants to see what offers other teams will present them, there really isn't anything their current team can do."
OrlandoMagic,3conjc,matty_hawk,2,Thu Jul 9 18:14:10 2015 UTC,The only thing i'll add is that Dipo started last season with a facial fracture and i dont think he played the first fortnight of the season (which was the time that Fournier couldn't miss from 3.
OrlandoMagic,3conjc,radardog95,2,Thu Jul 9 21:34:11 2015 UTC,Aaron Gordon is actually 19.
OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,elfreedpayton,14,Thu Jul 9 04:22:28 2015 UTC,Order goes:   Gordon Hezonja Oladipo Payton Harris Vucevic   I'm not gonna say Hezonja does when he hasn't played a single NBA game yet but I feel like that's the order. Vucevic and Harris are so low because they are already near their ceiling in my personal opinion.
OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,mjridiculouz,3,Thu Jul 9 04:26:13 2015 UTC,"Call me delusional, but I'm still holding out hope that at 24, Vucevic is still improving. I agree that offensively he might be near his peak, but I'm hoping that his defense will improve tremendously going forward, especially with Skiles as our coach."
OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,Joezee0801,2,Thu Jul 9 13:05:38 2015 UTC,Geez it's crazy that he's 24.... But yeah I understand where you are coming from but it's hard to imagine him getting any better on offense unless he puts the 3PT in his arsenal. I don't think we will see a huge jump in his defense just because he doesn't rotate well on defense but we will see if that changes or not.
OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,mjridiculouz,2,Thu Jul 9 15:00:35 2015 UTC,Nice this was mine.
OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,Orlandipo3,6,Thu Jul 9 14:01:33 2015 UTC,"Mine:   Gordon- He could be Blake Griffin-esque Hezonja- sharpshooter with great athleticism and supreme confidence Oladipo- Wade lite Payton- Rondo pre ACL is a fair best case Harris- Melo lite, 20 PPG  Vucevic- He's kinda reached it pretty much offensively, and it's not bad to have done so. Could be a top tier big man though IMO. He's close already..kinda   So yeah, I agree with /u/mjridiculouz"
OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,EyeoftheTyga,3,Thu Jul 9 06:36:04 2015 UTC,I think Vucevic is fighting hard for that 5th spot since he's averaging practically 20/11 (assuming you meant Harris' ceiling is 20ppg)
OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,mjridiculouz,3,Thu Jul 9 07:02:07 2015 UTC,I still see Elfrid Payton becoming more of a Gary Payton lite player if he improves his shot. Payton is already a better defender than Rondo which is why I don't like this comparison but I understand it.
OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,HAESisAMyth,2,Thu Jul 9 14:59:21 2015 UTC,That broken jump shot though  All he needs is the Eric Snow elbow jumper and he'd be amazing
OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,Bks1358,-1,Thu Jul 9 18:58:13 2015 UTC,Hezonja = Young Ray Allen maybe?
OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,tjwharry,5,Thu Jul 9 16:15:41 2015 UTC,"It's pretty hard to try to predict, given that we know so little about Hezonja's potential. And as an outsider (I don't really have a favorite team), Oladipo looks pretty damned impressive. It's interesting to me to see you guys put Gordon ahead of Oladipo, to be honest. I've been impressed with Gordon, but Oladipo looks really effing good.  Hezonja has star power though. It'll be interesting to see how the chemistry and everything else plays out."
OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,jarkarawr,3,Thu Jul 9 07:34:32 2015 UTC,Part of the reason people are saying Gordon over Oladipo is how young Gordon is. Oladipo turned 23 a couple months ago. Gordon turns 20 in September. Really crazy how young he is. Plus he looked really good before he got hurt last season and at the end of the season as well after he got back into rhythm.
OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,ciths,5,Thu Jul 9 13:38:32 2015 UTC,"After seeing how Gordon played in Summer league. IF he plays anywhere near that during the season he could really win the Most improve Player Award. Everyone says LeBron is a Freak of nature althlete but i would say Aaron Gordon is one of the most athletically gifted players to ever play the game.  1.Gordon  2.Hezonja   3.Oladipo  4.Payton IF he ever learns to shoot, he could be up there with gordon. His court vision is crazy.  5.Harris Hes not even 23"
OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,Gucciforlife,2,Thu Jul 9 08:54:00 2015 UTC,They typically don't give MIP award to second year players since they are supposed to improve a lot. If he comes out of the gate and is averaging 15/10 w good shooting and a few assists/block or steal then he could win it but otherwise not happening this year
OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,danielsilva12345,-1,Thu Jul 9 16:22:35 2015 UTC,wiggins is a better athelte dough
OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,alan4884,3,Thu Jul 9 18:03:44 2015 UTC,Hezonja  Gordon  Payton/Dipo tie for me. If Payton can just have an average nba shot going then he might have a slight edge here. still very high on Dipo mainly bc of the way he approaches the game.   Vooch  Harris  All in all I think we have a couple/few allstars on this roster in the future. I am fully on the Mario train or kart or whatever he's drivin. His post game interviews are already instant classics.
OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,Foxdashman,2,Thu Jul 9 12:11:42 2015 UTC,Gordon Hezonja Oladipo Payton Harris   My order on whom I think will actually be the best players is different though. Ceiling is based as much on what you haven't seen as what you have.
OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,karamellkid,2,Thu Jul 9 12:55:56 2015 UTC,"I think Gordon has the highest ceiling based on raw athleticism and untapped potential. Whether he reaches that potential is another story. I will say, however, we are one superstar away from being title contenders year in and year out in the future. With the depth we've drafted we have a hell of a rotation in a few years."

OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,thenotoriouscliff,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:48:32 2015 UTC,"Oladipo. He's only in his third year, and I fully expect him to make that leap. When he's in his full prime, I see his ceiling as a 24/6/6/2 guy. Gordon is not far behind though, but it will take much longer for him, as he is 19."

OrlandoMagic,3cn12p,j4jaymin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:23:00 2015 UTC,If Oladipo finds his shot he will be on fire. Defenders dare him to shoot and block his attempts to get to the rim cause he cant make shots. I hope he works on that this sunmer.
OrlandoMagic,3ckgtn,REEB,19,Wed Jul 8 16:44:28 2015 UTC,I'm done with this kid. He can do everything..... Defense has been good and he's an incredible passer....... I honestly can't find anything I dislike about him.

People from the Balkans, obviously Croatians especially, have been absolutely nuts about this guy. He'll be incredible.  Great skill-set, size for his position, athleticism, confidence. I think he'll be the best player of the draft."

OrlandoMagic,3clhsm,TweetPoster,2,Wed Jul 8 20:59:24 2015 UTC,"That's a real bummer! I mean it's smart so I can't blame them but Gordon was looking good and coming into his zone and still could probably use some work as could Payton whose needed to work on his shot so this extra time could have helped and Hezonja getting some time with just getting use to everything, plus I wanted to watch for my own amusement of course but I also think it would have really helped them all but again can't blame them for being safe."
OrlandoMagic,3clhsm,HakunaMatata023,2,Thu Jul 9 05:14:43 2015 UTC,"First of all, you don't wanna risk any of these guys getting injured. Also, Payton will be continuing to work on his form in the gym and get many opportunities during training camp and preseason. And...Hezonja is still fresh off a plane after just having finished a full season. Dude needs some rest and to get acclimated to his new home."
OrlandoMagic,3clhsm,SamuelMuniz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:39:02 2015 UTC,"I said I get why they did it but it's just a bummer because I wanted to watch him. Payton can practice his shot all he wants but real game action is where he's gonna improve the most and I don't think Hezonja is so tired where he can't play in a game for 20 mins or so every few days. He still needs to learn which game time will help with that, mainly Gordon is the big one because he was looking very good so I wish they'd let him build up his confidence.  There's lots of time still but it would have been nice to see them all a little."

OrlandoMagic,3cmq71,SamuelMuniz,2,Thu Jul 9 03:09:43 2015 UTC,Yeah...I remember reading somewhere that Hezonja had actually said in an interview that he's not on social media at all. Said he's too busy being in the gym and working on his game. Apparently he even said in another interview recently here in Orlando that he's never even gone to a bar. So I guess it's safe to say he's a gym rat.
OrlandoMagic,3cpnzj,raynorhoyt,20,Thu Jul 9 19:47:07 2015 UTC,"Jason Smith is a one year deal. We didn't want to commit ourselves to a 4 year deal and tie up our cap space. It gives us more options financially going forward. Plus, it doesn't matter if the deal was $20 million. It's just one year, and we aren't in play for any other free agents. Worst case Smith is gone after the year if he sucks, or we could use him as an expiring in a salary dump deal to get more assets. Plus we know KOQ really wanted to play back home and I don't think we should have robbed him of this opportunity.  As for Watson. He is a much better shooter than Lin. Lin is also terrible defensively. Watson is a much better all around point guard and a nice veteran presence to have on the team. We have had mutual interest for years now."
OrlandoMagic,3cpnzj,whtge8,2,Thu Jul 9 20:10:59 2015 UTC,"Perfect explanation, nice"
OrlandoMagic,3cpnzj,xiedian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:01:11 2015 UTC,"Shit, I remember we wanted to sign him as a starting PG to replace Nelson in the Dwight era after the Chris Paul rumors fell through."
OrlandoMagic,3cpnzj,spaceheatr,9,Sat Jul 11 04:58:56 2015 UTC,"We didn't want to commit to KOQ for that long and that's what KOQ wanted, he wanted to be with a team for the long term because as a 2nd round pick what more would you want?  Orlando has wanted Watson for like 5 years now and he is a good playmaker and all Pacers fans said that he was a great backup for them. Yes Jeremy Lin was cheaper and would capture a bigger fan base but there must be something that Hennigan prefers with Watson over Lin. It's probably that Watson is a veteran and Lin isn't.  The money shouldn't be an issue though because we had to overpay for Smith and maybe even Watson because we are under the salary cap so we had money to spare."
OrlandoMagic,3cpnzj,mjridiculouz,6,Thu Jul 9 20:14:43 2015 UTC,"Jeremy Lin is overrated. Watson is a better 3pt shooter and defender.   KOQ wanted out. He wasn't getting consistent burn here and he wanted an opportunity to showcase himself. It was the right thing to let him go. Magic signed Smith for 1 year because he's serviceable and the short deal provides some cap flexibility for next summer. He can play the 4 or 5, he's one of the best mid-range shooters in the league and he's a sneaky shot blocker."
OrlandoMagic,3cpnzj,REEB,4,Thu Jul 9 21:37:38 2015 UTC,We need veterans. Jason Smith can stretch the floor better than O'Quinn. CJ Watson is a proven back-up on winning teams.
OrlandoMagic,3cpnzj,UpvotesArePeople,2,Thu Jul 9 20:55:14 2015 UTC,Jeremy Lin has so many turnovers the dude should work as a baker not a basketball player. I'd much rather have CJ

OrlandoMagic,3cmrok,thenotoriouscliff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:15:11 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be so sure. They might trade Dirk (if he wants to contend) and release Carlisle because the tank train is rolling in Dallas. They won't get rid of these guys unless they want to leave though.

OrlandoMagic,3cmrok,bk10287,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:05:46 2015 UTC,What would be the trade? I think we would give up Frye for either a late 1st or a project/big man depth
OrlandoMagic,3cmrok,Joezee0801,2,Thu Jul 9 16:21:44 2015 UTC,"Hawks fan here. I'm just curious as to if the magic will try and make a run at him. I think he would be awesome for yall but I don't know much about the situation with your new coach, his contract, or your views on Carlisle."

OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,whtge8,3,Tue Jul 7 20:29:35 2015 UTC,"He seems to at least go after it instead of cowering like Frye. Of course, it probably means he gets dunked on a lot, too. Here he is blocking Deandre Jordan then immediately getting dunked on by Nick Young."
OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,rps215,6,Tue Jul 7 20:46:18 2015 UTC,Good. You should never be scared of getting dunked on. Rather see them at least try than just stepping aside.
OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,subutaime,3,Tue Jul 7 21:54:40 2015 UTC,Decent mid range shooter. I like this
OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,J_Melo,3,Tue Jul 7 20:18:37 2015 UTC,Agree with the above post's in that we should've kept KOQ. Henny and em must've seen something there we don't. 4 mill plus for Smith is hilarious. These new salaries are going to screw me up on 2k16.
OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,Swagneeto,8,Tue Jul 7 21:04:30 2015 UTC,"this is merely SPECULATION, but. wasn't the sign and trade with Kyle for a 2nd rounder and a undisclosed amount of CASH?? -  for all we know Smith's salary was paid for by the Knicks. So its possible we freed up some money over the next few years that could have gone to KOQ and also got a year contract paid for. I'm saying that sounds like good cap management to me."
OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,J_Melo,3,Tue Jul 7 22:28:26 2015 UTC,This is probably accurate.
OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,REEB,3,Tue Jul 7 23:16:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, at least someone is paying attention."
OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,onlysame1,4,Tue Jul 7 23:37:40 2015 UTC,Probably had to pay a little more to make it a 1 year deal.
OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,whtge8,6,Tue Jul 7 21:24:56 2015 UTC,Its for one year
OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,thenotoriouscliff,4,Tue Jul 7 21:46:02 2015 UTC,It's a one year deal dude. He will be gone by next year. It's just a one year rental to fill our backup 4/5 spot until next year.
OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,Vanchat,2,Tue Jul 7 21:56:17 2015 UTC,Cole Aldrich was the better Knicks frontcourt defender though.

OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,EyeoftheTyga,2,Tue Jul 7 22:58:26 2015 UTC,Very underrated player and he seemed to have good games against Orlando. I've always liked him. He's a smart player with range and knows his limitations. I'd rather have kept O'Quinn just because of his age but Smith is a better player at this point and if it's only for one year then that's even better

OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,whtge8,8,Tue Jul 7 20:40:29 2015 UTC,"Smith is a better mid-range shooter and he doesn't make as many dumb mistakes. I think it's mostly about length of contract though. Smith is 1 year, O'Quinn is 4 years. We're probably going to attempt to make a big splash in free agency next summer after striking out on Millsap."
OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,Orlandipo3,4,Tue Jul 7 21:19:23 2015 UTC,4 million a year for one year or 4 million a year for 4 years?
OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,whtge8,4,Tue Jul 7 21:55:15 2015 UTC,Exactly. It doesn't really matter if we paid this guy 10 million. It doesn't restrict us going forward
OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,Ellimistopher,6,Tue Jul 7 22:54:51 2015 UTC,Yup. People at /r/NBA just cant understand this concept. If we would have signed him to this deal before making an attempt at Millsap or resigning Harris then it may have been dumb. But there's like no other free agents left anyways. Signing him will have no negative impact on us. They just see $4 million and freak out.
OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,REEB,2,Tue Jul 7 23:04:10 2015 UTC,"I read the threads, it's really not /r/NBA that doesn't understand, it's mainly Magic fans who liked O'Quinn. There are some Knicks fans who are rubbing salt in those wounds, but most actually appreciated Smith for what he was. Any objections to the monetary value are ridiculous, very similar to the reaction to Ben Gordon last season."
OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,Heyooooh,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:35:58 2015 UTC,He was much better in New Orleans. I'm hoping that's how he plays in Orlando.

OrlandoMagic,3cgt36,Orlandipo3,0,Wed Jul 8 00:47:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly. There's no way Jason Smith is that much better than OQuinn. It would've made sense had we gotten assets from NY, but a 2nd rounder is lame. I'm glad we got Jason Smith because I think he's a good all around player, but would've still rather kept KOQ"

Simple he's on a one year contract (that might have been partially if not majority paid for by the KOQ S&T) and He's just better ... J is just as good, Definitely waaaaaay more athletic then Kyle, not to mention better shot blocker & leaper.   J/S ... IMO"
OrlandoMagic,3chjxf,REEB,2,Tue Jul 7 23:35:54 2015 UTC,"J is just as good   Smith's jumper is much better and more reliable. Shot 45% or better from mid-range the last four seasons, which puts him closer to Vuc than it does O'Quinn, and it looks like he's further along with his 3pt shot. O'Quinn is easily better near the basket though.   Definitely waaaaaay more athletic then Kyle, not to mention better shot blocker & leaper.   Smith is a higher leaper, but he has short arms. O'Quinn is the opposite... can't jump too high, but his length is incredible. Because of this, they get their blocks and play defense differently. Kyle's had better block, steal and rebound rates the last two years and he's a better rim protector, so I'd give him the nod on defense.  I prefer KOQ, but it seems he wanted out and/or we wanted to preserve some cap for next summer after missing out on Millsap. But yeah, I think people just see a tall white guy and automatically assume he's a stiff. He's a little underrated for a backup... he'll be fine off the bench and it's only 1 year."

About Orlando...I've been to Miami a lot and I think Orlando is kinda like a mini Miami only with a whole mess of theme parks. Downtown Orlando is much smaller than downtown Miami, but it's a very nice place to go. Lake Eola is beautiful, the nightlife is versatile so whatever you're into, you'll find it.  The cities surrounding Orlando like Winter Park, Altamonte, and Winter Springs are also very nice.  One last thing...life goes just a little slower here than in Miami. Definitely not small-town slow, but definitely a bit of a more chill pace. And if you're used to crazy traffic on I-95 at any hour, then I-4 will make you feel right at home (only without the luxury toll lanes...at least for the next few years)."
OrlandoMagic,3cgpmu,Big_Apple3AM,5,Tue Jul 7 19:49:30 2015 UTC,"Game 2 versus the Thunder  I'm going to put some play by play comments that I jotted down as I was watching and then do a player analysis/grades for a few players    Plays that were interesting   First play of the game was an offball screen set for Aaron Gordon. Came off the screen hard and shot a 15 footer and scored. Again looking really confident with his stroke. Elf and Davies pick and pop, Davies scores. Good stroke by Davies, contested but almost unblockable shot.  AG scores on an elbow shot 2/2. His shot looks more consistent. Still slow, but very clean. On defense, post (maybe McGary) gets the ball, AG digs at the ball and comes up with the steal. This play is important as AG being slightly undersized at the 4, when the ball enters the post, if we can't force turnovers, we'll get eaten alive. Stealing the post entry pass or the first dribble will deter them from attempting it consistently.  AG as PnR ball handler, does a great job of drawing the defense, makes a decent pass but a little wild - Turnover AG drives to the basket and gets fouled, commentators said he was uber confident, and I agree entirely. Sinks both free throws AG dribbles right, behind the back to his left, pull up jumper - score. 3/3 at this point and just unstoppable.  AG wing isolation, couple jab steps Carmelo style, drives, pulls up -scores  Hezonja and Harvey check in, Harvey puts up a couple bad shots Hezonja bad PnR defense, opens up lane to the baseline and allows pull up jumper Hezonja off ball screens (floppy as it's called in 2k lol) on like 4 of the 5 next plays. He looks good coming off the off ball screens, but I like him better in PnR Hez takes the screen, drives, and slams it - I'm sure everyone's seen this play by now Coursey with good helpside D, good on-ball D on back to back plays, Elf gets a steal on the second play Elf shoots a spot up 3, yikes. 3 point shot still looks awful from him Bad team defense on Dakari Johnson dunk, Hez should've rotated (hopefully Skiles whips him into shape) ORL 1/10 from 3 at this point - I think we're down by 4 in the 3rd at this point AG trailing, catches the 3 immediately squares up fires and scores Nice play run in the 4th, AG comes to high post, squares, and hits a backdoor cutter. Loving AG's ability to pass A couple bad turnovers led to OKC running out to a 8-10 point lead and securing the victory"
OrlandoMagic,3cgpmu,EyeoftheTyga,4,Tue Jul 7 20:11:08 2015 UTC,"Player Analysis     Aaron Gordon:   Easy to say he played phenomenal, playing like he has something to prove. Hustling all over the court whether it be by grabbing rebounds, blocking shots, or sprinting down the floor in transition.  Then there's the fact that he shot the ball really well. Made a couple tough shots from all over the floor. Good mix of jumpshots, spot up shots, drives, and post up hooks.  Still struggling a bit in half court ball-handling situations. As the PnR ball-handler, had a couple turnovers. As the ball-handler in transition or in the high post, he has made good decisions. Forcing the issue a bit in the half court.  Effort on defense won't be lacking, but size definitely is. Got a little overpowered by McGary when matched up.    Overall Grade: A    Elfrid Payton   It's tough to even write a lot about Elf because he barely even showed up. It's not like he played bad, it's just sort that he was non existent too many times. Plays that were run for other players, Elfrid hit them in a good position, but barely any plays run for Elfrid Did a good job of knowing when to full court press and when to sink back. Kept OKC out of some opportunities to get a quick hitter. Help side defense was great, grabbed a couple steals by being in good position.  Shot still looks bad. Got blocked on a jumper, and had a terrible miss from 3. Doesn't even look to be scoring from the elbows or 3 (which is a good thing) While AG looks like he has something to prove, Elf almost looks content playing sub-par in SL.   Overall Grade: C+    Mario Hezonja   Already looked much more confident in this game. Even shooting worse, he looked comfortable coming off screens. Needs to gain some weight and muscle. Got overpowered a little bit on defense and on drives Makes a couple questionable choices on defense. Opens up lane for ball handler in PnR defense and allows for a lane. Without adequate rim protection, this is totally not the strategy to take. I doubt Skiles told him to do this.  We ran tons of off ball screens (floppy) for him. He did a good job recognizing when the shot was there and when he needed to swing. Made quick decisions and crisp passes.  Offense moved much more fluid and active with Hez getting involved. He's definitely a great offensive player.   Overall Grade : B - would've bumped to B+ if he shot better    Brandon Davies   Good pick and pop, decent rebounds, aside from that is absolutely terrible. Had a few turnovers that were just boneheaded plays. Dribbled off his shoe in the backcourt, just dumb stuff   Overall Grade: D-    Roy Devyn Marble   Played well on defense, forced his man out of shots, stayed in front Shot the ball poorly and a bit erratically. Didn't really seem comfortable.  Is he still hurt? Otherwise, I see him getting sent down to the Bayhawks   Overall Grade: D    Tyler Harvey   Shoots the ball with great confidence and swagger, but just plain missing.  Could've driven the ball to the hoop many more times than he did, but passed it up for the opportunity to shoot a semi-contested 3. Questionable shot choices Had a couple hustle plays, and played ok defense - his only saving grace in this game   Overall Grade: C-    Daniel Coursey   Had no idea who this guy was coming in, but I was pleasantly surprised Had great helpside defense, rebounded well, put himself in good position Terrific screen setter. Makes himself very wide, and sets legal screens.  If not for the Jason Smith signing today, I would've picked this guy as a darkhorse 12th man. Didn't seem much of an offensive game from him, but with Hez, Harvey, and AG tossing up shots, I'm not surprised   Overall Grade: B+"
OrlandoMagic,3cg74u,RonnocFjord,7,Tue Jul 7 17:42:11 2015 UTC,Yeah same. I've really liked how he has played so far. Hoping we can give him a spot as our 3rd string PG.

OrlandoMagic,3cg74u,ez_mac,2,Tue Jul 7 18:57:53 2015 UTC,I watched his few Pistons games. Too small and not quick enough to make plays and misses shots. He can drive well.

OrlandoMagic,3cg3bu,whtge8,8,Tue Jul 7 20:26:06 2015 UTC,"I think we'll be fine without a trade. I could see Frye at the 4 to begin the season with Gordon eventually taking over the starting role, Tobias primarily at the 3, with Hezonja as the primary spark plug off the bench playing mostly the 3 and some 2, along with Fournier.   In today's NBA, the more versatile you are position wise, the better"
OrlandoMagic,3cg3bu,Joezee0801,3,Tue Jul 7 17:24:58 2015 UTC,Harris is gonna play the 4 over Gordon imo because you need Gordon out on the perimeter. We just gotta accept that we have no rim protection and hope that Skiles has something to make it look not as bad as it really it on paper.
OrlandoMagic,3cg3bu,mjridiculouz,5,Tue Jul 7 17:28:40 2015 UTC,"You could be right. Regardless, I am very interested in seeing how it all pans out. I'll be the first to admit that I was not initially a fan of the Skiles hire, but while it's an unsexy hire, I think it can help our team move in the right direction.   Still holding out hope that Vuc will improve as a rim protector and that Skiles can aid him in that development."
OrlandoMagic,3cg3bu,Joezee0801,2,Tue Jul 7 17:36:09 2015 UTC,Scott has his work cut out for him but I think he will require defense to be played by our guys or they will lose playing time.  So I think Tobais and Vuc will be working on their defense this summer.
OrlandoMagic,3cg3bu,Scottydoesntknowyou,6,Tue Jul 7 18:04:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah regardless of who starts at the 4, whether it is Harris, Gordon, Frye, Dedmon, or a FA we may sign, I am 100% certain that (injuries pending) throughout the season the majority of the minutes played at the 4 for our team will be by Harris and Gordon. Im prepared for a lot of small ball. Skiles can really get this team to play great team defense even without a true ""rim protector"" which will allow us to play small which will benefit the offense in return."
OrlandoMagic,3cg3bu,thug_life4,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:34:45 2015 UTC,"Another PF added to the fold, ironically from my squad! I personally think he's trash, probably won't play much. Otherwise you guys have a nice core of young players. Here's to hoping Elfrid and Aaron Gordon develop their jumper, you guys should be exciting to watch the next couple of years"
OrlandoMagic,3cg3bu,ez_mac,2,Tue Jul 7 20:15:44 2015 UTC,I think they'd at least let this core group play out the year.  Managements whole motto has been development.  So you let players show what they can do and hope Skiles is able to utilize the ones showing the most value.    I do think if we miss the playoffs again this year then someone is gonna get shipped off.
OrlandoMagic,3cg3bu,ajax0626,4,Tue Jul 7 19:01:16 2015 UTC,"Pretty simple imo. I mean, we can run Oladipo, Hezonja, Harris, Gordon Vucevic. Or we can run Payton, Dipo, Gordon, Harris, Vucci. Or Payton, Fournier, Hezonja, Harris, Dedmon. Or (this could go on for sometime.)   Tldr they all have position versatility, none of them will be traded."
OrlandoMagic,3cg10y,ajax0626,3,Tue Jul 7 17:00:31 2015 UTC,No problem. We got Aaron 'Michael Jordan' Gordon.

OrlandoMagic,3cg10y,TweetPoster,2,Tue Jul 7 17:01:37 2015 UTC,That's okay. Wasn't Hezonja only supposed to play a few games? Or am I thinking of another top pick..
OrlandoMagic,3cg10y,EyeoftheTyga,2,Tue Jul 7 17:49:23 2015 UTC,He was only supposed to play in 2 Games
OrlandoMagic,3cdmg8,IDontBeatGames,17,Tue Jul 7 02:21:37 2015 UTC,I've seen this a lot over the past year.... we must be doing something right if we're able to get the attention of outside fans despite our lack of wins. Hopefully the team finally comes together and produces some wins this season.
OrlandoMagic,3cdmg8,REEB,5,Tue Jul 7 03:12:45 2015 UTC,"Well you guys have a great core (Tobias,Oladipo,Elfrid,Vucevic and now Gordon who's doing amazing in the Summer league [yes, I'm watching the Orlando Magic squad]) .  It's also the eastern conference, the team right now itself is an 8th seed team without any debate. I mean the top teams are obviously Miami, Cleveland, Chicago, ATL, TOR, WAS and MIL.  8th seed could be the Magic if they fight for it. Sooner or later Orlando will become a big market for agents, not the top ones but those who are getting there. Personally, I believe the Magic should pick up Gerald Green before another team does."
OrlandoMagic,3cdmg8,whtge8,2,Tue Jul 7 03:17:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think Gerald Green really has a spot on our roster. We have enough wings in Harris, Gordon, and Hezonja. We just need another big."
OrlandoMagic,3cdmg8,whtge8,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:38:51 2015 UTC,Ah true. You know would be a good pickup and would get real minutes? KJ McDaniels. I think he would flourish on the team especially cause he was doing crazy things on the 76ers and now he's just a bench player for HOU.
OrlandoMagic,3cdmg8,whtge8,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:00:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree honestly. We have Oladipo and Fournier at SG. We are good at every position besides PF/C. We have Payton/Watson, Oladipo/Fournier, Harris/Hezonja, Gordon/Frye?, Vucevic/Dedmon?  We have enough guards/wings. We need another big body."
OrlandoMagic,3cdmg8,Foxdashman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:04:12 2015 UTC,"I know ORL isn't a big destination for certain FAs, but if you could do a S&T for a big body, who would want to get? I know a lot of HOU fans are slowly starting to want to get rid of Terrence Jones. He has hot and cold games, but if he was able to maximize his potential else where as a starter who knows what he can do"
OrlandoMagic,3cdmg8,Foxdashman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:17:35 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind Jones. I really don't know what we would give up. Most of our young players seem to be part of our core so we wouldn't want to move them. That would just leave Harkless and Nicholson. You can have Frye if you want too lol
OrlandoMagic,3cdmg8,IamtheQuestionMaster,2,Tue Jul 7 17:19:35 2015 UTC,"The scary thing about the core of the Magic is that none of them are at their max potential. If they all stick together long term, they could easily become something dominant. I personally think this team right now could at least be 7-8 seed.  And lmao. Jones is worth the pick up but I don't know how the trade would go down."
OrlandoMagic,3cdmg8,tjwharry,2,Tue Jul 7 17:22:03 2015 UTC,"I love Gerald Green in NBA2k, but aside from his 2013-2014 season, I don't think he is a very good NBA player. He is an unabashed chucker, who is very disengaged on defense, and doesn't care to be involved in an offensive scheme beyond the point of just shooting and dunking. He is fun to watch in highlights, but I think a marriage of Gerald Green and Scott Skiles would be a nightmare (beyond the comedic value).  I definitely hope you're right about the 8th seed. I think that is absolutely possible and am surprised how basically not pundits are predicting the Magic to be in play for the postseason next year."
OrlandoMagic,3cdmg8,RainbowSkull,2,Tue Jul 7 14:52:31 2015 UTC,"Realistically, who would be a good target for you guys then? Cause I don't believe that there's many FA's left."
OrlandoMagic,3ccwfy,REEB,10,Mon Jul 6 22:50:28 2015 UTC,He is very highlight friendly. him and aaron seem like they have a little chemistry building too. you can tell they are excited to play together
OrlandoMagic,3ccwfy,alan4884,4,Mon Jul 6 23:49:32 2015 UTC,"I know it's the summer league and I have to hold my excitement but I am stoked to see our team this year. It can be a special year if Payton can learn to make teams pay when leaving him with 3-5 foot cushions, it will open up so many lanes for AG, Mario and Vic.   We have a lot of guys who move well without the ball. After some more polishing, hopefully we can tone the turnovers down. If that happens, we can score with the best of them."
OrlandoMagic,3ccwfy,youactappalled,6,Tue Jul 7 00:58:56 2015 UTC,I am so happy right now.
OrlandoMagic,3ccwfy,Lauxman,4,Tue Jul 7 01:45:27 2015 UTC,Exciting to say the least.
OrlandoMagic,3ce47e,paulzors,9,Tue Jul 7 05:03:37 2015 UTC,"Play him as the backup SG, I'd imagine."
OrlandoMagic,3ce47e,VanceIX,7,Tue Jul 7 05:10:27 2015 UTC,He should be playing the backup SG position and filling the 6th man role for the 1st half of the year as we let Hezonja get his feet wet in the NBA. Hezonja should be playing backup SF I would assume. I love Fournier and I feel like he's apart of our young core in terms of who we hope to have apart of our future contending team. He isn't gonna be an all-star by all means but you need rotation guys if you want to compete and I feel like he will be that guy for us.
OrlandoMagic,3ce47e,mjridiculouz,6,Tue Jul 7 05:30:48 2015 UTC,"We need him for depth. He's a 2/3 and Mario's a 3/2, so we're fine with rotations."
OrlandoMagic,3ce47e,REEB,3,Tue Jul 7 13:35:10 2015 UTC,"I'm excited to see him and Mario play together in the second unit. Have Fournier run pick and roll with Dedmon and then can find frye, Watson, and Mario on the outside. The spacing of our second unit is really good Fournier and Mario can drive and kick all day as well"
OrlandoMagic,3ce47e,Rockledgeskater,2,Tue Jul 7 13:14:44 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%, I think out 2nd unit will be very strong and that will help us get a lot more wins this year."
OrlandoMagic,3ce47e,Scottydoesntknowyou,3,Tue Jul 7 18:10:11 2015 UTC,We have so many line-ups we can play. They will all be squeezed in.  I actually think Harkless will get some burn because of his defensive potential and maybe to be showcased a bit for a trade.
OrlandoMagic,3ce47e,BigChiefWiggum,2,Tue Jul 7 13:37:39 2015 UTC,Also could play some 1 if we wanna have a huge lineup with him and Hez in the back court.
OrlandoMagic,3ce47e,ninety4kid,2,Tue Jul 7 15:59:18 2015 UTC,"People think that just because a good player isn't getting 28 mpg, that he's not worthwhile to have on a team. Bench depth really comes in handy in the 2nd half of the season when team's legs aren't as fresh. If Fournier is only playing about 22 mpg, by the end of the season, our bench unit will be running all over other teams. Our starters will stay a lot more fresh as well."
OrlandoMagic,3ce47e,Big_Apple3AM,2,Tue Jul 7 19:40:49 2015 UTC,"Those number are even down from the hot start he had. He had a knee? injury like a quarter of the year. I think he was playing hurt a lot. He can really shoot it, and we also used him to run PnR quite a bit. I think we'll see AG, Hez, and Fournier all on the court together a decent amount."

OrlandoMagic,3ccpv7,REEB,8,Mon Jul 6 22:01:17 2015 UTC,"I know it's extremely early, but it's absolutely amazing how much he improved over the course of just one season. He looks incredible."
OrlandoMagic,3ccpv7,whtge8,6,Mon Jul 6 23:49:44 2015 UTC,"Hezonja may be making more highlight plays, but Air Gordon's game is looking vastly improved. Dude looks like he's been working hard. Handles look improved, jump shot looks deadly, and he seems to be skying over everyone for rebounds that just look effortless.   Hopefully this transitions into games against the big boys...."
OrlandoMagic,3ccpv7,rockinwithmycockout,3,Mon Jul 6 23:09:26 2015 UTC,"I definitely think he'll be better this year, and he'll be poised for a 3rd year breakout. That handle can get better still, and the shot too, but damn if I'm not happy he's already made this much progress. He keeps working, keeps hustling, he'll be damn good in a hurry."
OrlandoMagic,3ccpv7,AndrewFlash,2,Mon Jul 6 23:34:24 2015 UTC,"I think you're right about 3rd year breakout. I think we'll see flashes this year, mixed in with some lulls and slumps. I bet by season's end he starts putting it all together though."
OrlandoMagic,3ccpv7,rockinwithmycockout,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:44:52 2015 UTC,I love having a big man who can grab the board and push the break. The other thing that stood out to me is the pick and role Mario and AG pulled off.

Fouls a lot though but he could probably give 25-30 mpg (IIRC he fouls out per36 :p )"

OrlandoMagic,3cawtp,ctuk08,2,Mon Jul 6 23:02:09 2015 UTC,"Still a bit expensive for an end of the bench player.  Also, it would have been fucked up to deprive him of a chance to actually be a (presumably heavy) rotation guy."

OrlandoMagic,3cawtp,CaptainBananaFish,9,Mon Jul 6 14:57:32 2015 UTC,I'm gonna miss him so much...... I honestly feel like Hennigan should've paid the $4 to keep him just for off court chemistry reasons because this team is really close and just losing one family member must hurt.
OrlandoMagic,3cawtp,mjridiculouz,14,Mon Jul 6 14:32:06 2015 UTC,"I partially agree. I am a huge KOQ fan, and really wanted him to stay just for chemistry reasons. But this is a pretty big opportunity for him. We all know he has always wanted to play in NY and I don't think we should deny him of that opportunity just for chemistry reasons. He can be a good contributor in NY."
OrlandoMagic,3cawtp,whtge8,8,Mon Jul 6 14:33:36 2015 UTC,"As much as KOQ loves Orlando and the guys, that would have been a disservice to him, robbing him of the chance to actually play and contribute."

OrlandoMagic,3cawtp,bigduck24,3,Mon Jul 6 14:35:17 2015 UTC,Nice comments from Kyle.  Thanks for sharing them.  I like the things he said.  Also the things Tobias said about the Magic.  You can see that Hennigan has been somewhat successful in rebuilding the culture here in Orlando and getting guys that wanted to be here.   It all bodes well for our future.  Good luck Kyle O'Quinn.  I hope you have a successful Knick career!
OrlandoMagic,3cawtp,maddog00,3,Mon Jul 6 15:12:57 2015 UTC,"I got to meet KOQ once in SODO during his rookie year right after Hedo injury that ended up pretty much ending his career. Even though we only spoke for like 3 minutes, I instantly connected with who he was and was glad he was here.   I'm very happy for him and the awesome deal he got in NY and I think part of letting him go was in respect for who he can become as a player.  And yes, the guys are gonna find it tough for one of their buddies to get traded, but at the end of the day, these guys are professionals. The only time I saw friends getting split up really affecting things was when Weisbrod traded Cutino Mobley for Doug Christie (what a terrible freakin' GM that guy was!)"
OrlandoMagic,3cawtp,SamuelMuniz,4,Mon Jul 6 17:06:58 2015 UTC,When he comes back to play us I'll make sure to cheer for him. Seems like a cool dude

OrlandoMagic,3cbjpi,EyeoftheTyga,4,Mon Jul 6 17:04:38 2015 UTC,Glen Rice Jr can't be on our team with that hawks tattoo. I shun him no matter how well/ or doesn't play in SL. Haha.
OrlandoMagic,3cbjpi,ninety4kid,3,Mon Jul 6 17:33:16 2015 UTC,"Let me find out where glen rice Jr is from then I'll get back to you lol. Didn't realize elfrid had the hornet on it, I thought it was just the thingy(whats it called?) Only acceptable for me if it's the home team. Lol  *found it. Glen Rice Jr was born in Miami. Reason two. Hahahaha."
OrlandoMagic,3cbjpi,ninety4kid,4,Mon Jul 6 17:44:35 2015 UTC,Yeah it's called a fleur-de-lis. Elfrid has the old Hornets logo which includes the fleur-de-lis which is a big part of Cajun/Creole culture.
OrlandoMagic,3cbjpi,SamuelMuniz,3,Mon Jul 6 17:58:41 2015 UTC,At least he's got reason. Wonder what glen rice jrs reason for the hawks logo is then.
OrlandoMagic,3cbjpi,ninety4kid,3,Mon Jul 6 18:36:40 2015 UTC,"Rice jr grew up in georgia, went to HS n college there. I think we can allow it."
OrlandoMagic,3cbjpi,robot_foley,3,Mon Jul 6 18:37:34 2015 UTC,He's similar to marble.
OrlandoMagic,3cbjpi,ninety4kid,4,Mon Jul 6 18:51:46 2015 UTC,Singleton should fill our beard void :) haha. Id rather him than Quincy Acy.
OrlandoMagic,3cbjpi,ninety4kid,3,Mon Jul 6 19:17:19 2015 UTC,He is beasting right now
OrlandoMagic,3cbjpi,thekittymaster,2,Mon Jul 6 17:37:13 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have Acy. Singleton was in the league for 3 years and struggled. Good to see him play well in SL to try and make a roster, but I'm not buying it."
OrlandoMagic,3cbjpi,REEB,3,Mon Jul 6 17:38:23 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, Turner what a block.  What do you guys think of Appling potentially making the team? He's looked good in the SL early"
OrlandoMagic,3cbjpi,ninety4kid,3,Mon Jul 6 18:56:24 2015 UTC,He's gotta out play whatever guards are on our blue team most likely. Since the white team in itself is already our Erie bayhawaks team. Lol.
OrlandoMagic,3cbjpi,DirtyPoetry,3,Mon Jul 6 17:14:55 2015 UTC,AG's shot is lookin nice
OrlandoMagic,3c7r15,Woodsoot,10,Sun Jul 5 18:09:22 2015 UTC,Only team he would've left for is the Knicks ... and that's only because he's from there.
OrlandoMagic,3c7r15,Elccg,2,Sun Jul 5 18:20:58 2015 UTC,And doesn't Tobias's new contract expire when Melo's does...?
OrlandoMagic,3c7r15,UpvotesArePeople,7,Sun Jul 5 20:13:19 2015 UTC,"@JKepnerWFTV:   2015-07-05 17:46:55 UTC  Source tells me BOS, DET, NO all offered Tobias Harris max. SAC even submitted max offer sheet. Turned all down to stay with @OrlandoMagic.     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]"
OrlandoMagic,3c7r15,TweetPoster,6,Sun Jul 5 18:10:58 2015 UTC,"Did Tobias sign for a discount? That would mean something. Otherwise with him being restricted and Orlando matching all offers, it could just be good PR to stay put."
OrlandoMagic,3c7r15,richIsBored,3,Sun Jul 5 21:40:43 2015 UTC,"I think the max could have got him a few more million over the length of the contract, though that's likely negated by state tax. Still means something because if he wanted out he could have put up a fuss, got other teams to include trade kickers, and then dared magic to match."
OrlandoMagic,3c7r15,REEB,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:20:46 2015 UTC,Yeah he left 16 mil total on the table if the kings really did offer the max to him
OrlandoMagic,3c7r15,tallanasty420,2,Sun Jul 5 22:22:20 2015 UTC,Pretty sure a max for Harris was 4 years 67 million. We signed him for 4/64.
OrlandoMagic,3c7r15,REEB,0,Sun Jul 5 23:39:53 2015 UTC,I thought the max was 4/80 but either way he did leave some money on the table.
OrlandoMagic,3c7r15,tallanasty420,6,Mon Jul 6 03:45:36 2015 UTC,Max is less for restricted free agents coming off rookie scale deals.
OrlandoMagic,3c7r15,REEB,4,Mon Jul 6 05:17:35 2015 UTC,😍
OrlandoMagic,3c7r15,pnp_,2,Mon Jul 6 00:31:57 2015 UTC,"Only real and fit in that list would have been NO. Playing stretch 4 with either Davis or Asik being able to protect the rim on D would have been a nice fit. Never been a huge Tobias fan, but happy he's here to stay."
OrlandoMagic,3c7r15,safetydance,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:59:05 2015 UTC,"They already have Ryan Anderson, but yes that'd also be a good fit"
OrlandoMagic,3c7grw,TeddySpatch,31,Sun Jul 5 16:33:17 2015 UTC,"that Channing Frye has to go and he needs to start in Frye's place   We're all thinking it, but I wish fans wouldn't say things like that directly to players, especially a player as young as Gordon. He has enough on his table at 19, the last thing we need is for him to start having thoughts that go against his coach/GM/teammates. If he deserves to start, it will come in time when the people who are paid to make those decisions think he's ready."
OrlandoMagic,3c7grw,REEB,16,Sun Jul 5 17:19:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was kind of a shitty thing to say. We don't know what kind of relationship Aaron and Channing have and it would really suck to hear what some of the fans think about him. If Aaron viewed Channing as a mentor then that might be tough to hear, especially someone so young like Aaron."
OrlandoMagic,3c7grw,whtge8,2,Sun Jul 5 17:34:23 2015 UTC,do you mean 'what kind of relationship Aaron and Frye have' ?
OrlandoMagic,3c7grw,pinklechunk,4,Sun Jul 5 17:54:57 2015 UTC,They both went to Arizona so they have that common
OrlandoMagic,3c7grw,bajazona,3,Sun Jul 5 19:11:43 2015 UTC,Whoops. Fixing it now.
OrlandoMagic,3c7grw,whtge8,3,Sun Jul 5 17:58:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I wouldn't want someone telling me they hope my boss gets fired so I can move up, or something along those lines"
OrlandoMagic,3c7grw,EyeoftheTyga,6,Sun Jul 5 22:53:44 2015 UTC,"You're right. I don't dislike Frye, either. I meant to be encouraging to AG by telling him that I think he's good enough to be a starter for us for a long time, but it came out like I was a drunk asshole, well, because I was a drunk asshole.  Edit: My friend just texted me and told me that AG laughed when I said that, like he was agreeing with me. Maybe AG is thinking like us fans."
OrlandoMagic,3c7grw,pinklechunk,3,Sun Jul 5 18:25:44 2015 UTC,where did all of this happen?
OrlandoMagic,3c7grw,VictorOladeepthroat,5,Sun Jul 5 17:55:07 2015 UTC,Near Lake Eola by the 7-11
OrlandoMagic,3c7grw,Eatplaster,-1,Sun Jul 5 18:18:50 2015 UTC,I heard there are some bomb ass bitches over there
OrlandoMagic,3c7grw,dev1359,2,Mon Jul 6 05:39:15 2015 UTC,This was an awesome story & thanks for sharing. It wasn't that big of a deal to mention that Gordon should be starting over Frye. Don't sweat it too hard. Both Gordon AND Frye probably know it.
OrlandoMagic,3c7poq,Elccg,7,Sun Jul 5 17:57:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, similar style to Melo. No, definitely can't play SG."
OrlandoMagic,3c7poq,REEB,4,Sun Jul 5 18:07:55 2015 UTC,Agreed. No better comparison than Melo. Especially if Toby keeps working on his three.
OrlandoMagic,3c7poq,melvin445,4,Sun Jul 5 18:11:39 2015 UTC,Pretty much Melo. Also been compared to Rudy Gay.
OrlandoMagic,3c7poq,whtge8,3,Sun Jul 5 21:56:23 2015 UTC,"I would say in terms of size he is a stereotypical tweener forward (6""8 or 6""9). His main strength is scoring which he does most efficiently via drives and on the move mid range jumpers. He did increase his 3 pt percentage to 36% this past year but that was on a decent amount of corner threes so i would not say that is a strength yet. His defense is pretty mediocre especially considering his athleticism."
OrlandoMagic,3c7poq,michaelkiefer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:07:25 2015 UTC,But his defence is better than Melo's.
OrlandoMagic,3c7poq,Shermanpk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:54:31 2015 UTC,I agree
OrlandoMagic,3c7poq,michaelkiefer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:32:02 2015 UTC,"I refer to him as Melo-lite. The offensive game doesn't come as easily for Tobias as it does Melo--but Tobias is making great strides to close the gap. The other thing to note, too, is Tobias has never had the usage rate that Melo has had throughout his career. Which can explain why there's a gap in some of the counting stats.  With that being said, I love Tobias and I'm pumped he's going to be here for the next four years."
OrlandoMagic,3c6k2s,bballplayersgs,11,Sun Jul 5 08:52:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure we're playoff-bound this year yet or not. A lot of things would have to go right for us, particularly regarding the injury bug, though it might be possible. Either way, I'd agree with you on our drafting being much improved over recent years (save for the Howard/Nelson draft), so there's a lot of optimism here. It definitely feels like we're building another contender. Hope to see you in the Finals soon."
OrlandoMagic,3c6k2s,mufcreddevil7,11,Sun Jul 5 13:44:54 2015 UTC,"Too many magic fans keep saying we're 1 year away for the past 2 or 3 years.  THIS is the year the Magic should and will make a huge jump in the wins column.  If you saw our games last year a lot of those losses were close and came down to bad rotations from the coaching staff in my opinion.  They couldn't close out games and they took out hot shooters at weird times...  I really think a 4-6 seed is very doable for this young talented team, can't wait to see it all come together."
OrlandoMagic,3c6k2s,GuCruise,2,Sun Jul 5 14:09:21 2015 UTC,We had a ton of close losses that came down to coaching. I believe Skiles will flip that around.
OrlandoMagic,3c6k2s,svanxx,8,Sun Jul 5 22:33:25 2015 UTC,"I think we're still a year away but if we can make big jumps on defense as skiles track record would indicate, I think there's a chance. Also the Warriors were my side bitch team this year, never a dull game."
OrlandoMagic,3c6k2s,Fatal_Conceit,4,Sun Jul 5 13:45:07 2015 UTC,"Dunno if we make it or not, but no excuses this year. We aren't tanking, and we need to impress free agents for next year. If we had gotten Milsap I'd say we definitely would have made it, but it's going to be a grind this year. Hopefully internal growth + Skiles can do it."
OrlandoMagic,3c6k2s,Kaiiu,2,Sun Jul 5 14:32:46 2015 UTC,I say we need to impress free agents for the trade deadline.  About halfway through the season there will be some teams looking to deal.  We may pick up a stud that could fill a hole for us and get us to the playoffs.  I believe!  :)
OrlandoMagic,3c6k2s,maddog00,2,Sun Jul 5 17:21:51 2015 UTC,Yep. We should keep our eyes on Boogie.
OrlandoMagic,3c6k2s,Kaiiu,3,Sun Jul 5 18:08:04 2015 UTC,"We need to at least be in contention for the spot. I see Cleveland, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington, Miami, Milwaukee, and Toronto making it for sure. Indiana will also be fighting for that spot. It's going to be tough, but I just want to see effort from our guys. Not what we saw last year under Vaughn."
OrlandoMagic,3c6k2s,whtge8,2,Sun Jul 5 15:19:58 2015 UTC,"I haven't had any confidence in this team until now, but for some reason I'm fully convinced we're making the playoffs this year.  Too much talent to keep missing.  At least I hope so, I made a bet with a friend that we would.  Not a smart bet I guess but I like our team this year."
OrlandoMagic,3c6k2s,BucHerRightInDaPussy,2,Sun Jul 5 23:41:50 2015 UTC,"Celtics fan here. I concur, dope roster. I wanted Hezonja in green, but he fits great on your team. Y'all will be fun to watch."
OrlandoMagic,3c6k2s,BQGIE,0,Mon Jul 6 04:52:31 2015 UTC,I hate the warriors so bad though.
OrlandoMagic,3c6pjr,dramaQ,11,Sun Jul 5 10:34:39 2015 UTC,"PG: Payton/Watson SG: Oladipo/Fournier SF: Harris/Hezonja PF: Gordon/Frye C: Vucevic/Dedmon     Some mix and match position-wise with the forwards and wings, but I think that'll be it right there.  I don't think anyone else will be getting very many minutes."
OrlandoMagic,3c6pjr,CaptainBananaFish,7,Sun Jul 5 15:20:43 2015 UTC,"PG: Elfrid Payton, CJ Watson, Victor Oladipo, Evan Fournier, Tyler Harvey  SG: Victor Oladipo, Evan Fournier, Mario Hezonja, Tyler Harvey  SF: Tobias Harris, Mario Hezonja, Aaron Gordon, Maurice Harkless, Evan Fournier  PF: Aaron Gordon, Channing Frye, Tobias Harris, Andrew Nicholson, Dwayne Dedmon  C:   Nic Vucevic, Dwayne Dedmon, TBD  Edit: Excuse me. It was really early when I did this. I meant to have Super Mario right behind Tobias and a close, if not equal, split in minutes when Tobias slides to the 4."
OrlandoMagic,3c6pjr,melvin445,5,Sun Jul 5 10:56:54 2015 UTC,"Don't forget hezonja is a swingman too. He's thin but I honestly think he might be taller than Aaron Gordon, should be able to guard sf year 1. Also I watched Tyler Harvey play in game one of the summer league and I doubt he makes the roster. Probably needs time in the d league."
OrlandoMagic,3c6pjr,Fatal_Conceit,2,Sun Jul 5 13:40:41 2015 UTC,"Not so sure Nicholson will be on the team.  Also, I agree with you on Hezonja being a swingman. I think he leads the second unit as our SF."
OrlandoMagic,3c6pjr,BigChiefWiggum,2,Sun Jul 5 14:11:33 2015 UTC,I went and made the edit. It was early and I forgot to retype his name there. I completely agree that he is made for the 3 and that he will be very competitive with Tobias for minutes at that spot.
OrlandoMagic,3c6pjr,melvin445,2,Sun Jul 5 14:23:48 2015 UTC,if the roster stays like this hezonja is not looking at too much minutes or?
OrlandoMagic,3c6pjr,jarethcutestory,2,Sun Jul 5 14:09:51 2015 UTC,Harvey will not make the roster guys.
OrlandoMagic,3c6pjr,HakunaMatata023,0,Sun Jul 5 19:15:52 2015 UTC,"I don't see why he couldn't, especially since he can play both PG and SG and was on the list of best shooters coming out. Not sure how much playing time he'll his first year but I think there's a solid chance he makes the team even if he's on the bench for a lot of it."
OrlandoMagic,3c6pjr,jarethcutestory,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:49:40 2015 UTC,"He's not particularly good. He can shoot, and that's about it. Lacks athleticsm, defense, ball handling. He's too one dimensional. Not worth a spot on the main roster. Maybe we can stash him in the D league, but that's about it."
OrlandoMagic,3c6pjr,HakunaMatata023,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"If there's one thing Orlando needs its shooting that's why Hezonja was such a great pick so just with that makes him worth a spot. I'm not too sure how his other skills translate but from what I've heard he seems like a solid guy and his versatility makes him even more valuable. Looking at this roster right now I don't see him not making it, he's better then a few players on it already."
OrlandoMagic,3c6pjr,jarethcutestory,2,Mon Jul 6 02:56:18 2015 UTC,"Wait, are we still talking about Harvey? No, he is not better than anyone on the current roster, and he's not versatile. That's the point."
OrlandoMagic,3c6pjr,HakunaMatata023,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:32:18 2015 UTC,"Well he is versatile since he can play both guard positions and ya he seems better then a few already. He was very good from the 3 point line and was a good scorer with the ball in his hands and both of those are what the Magic really need, he's one of the better scorers in this Draft. Offensively he will be a great pickup, I'm sure he'll improve in other areas but for now being a true scorer will help him a lot so I think there's a good chance he makes the roster."
OrlandoMagic,3c6pjr,Fasyed21,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:29:58 2015 UTC,How do we get Payton Dipo Gordon Super Mario and the Vucevic on the floor together.  I like A lot but like these guys a bit more. We have so much talent esp with Gordon's new development and super Mario will be the scorer we been missing

OrlandoMagic,3c4n4g,Jonahoe,3,Sat Jul 4 19:28:28 2015 UTC,They split us between two teams in order to have an even amount of teams.

OrlandoMagic,3c4n4g,Jonahoe,5,Sat Jul 4 19:29:19 2015 UTC,"Basically longshots to make the team. Our Blue team is the A team, White team the B team."
OrlandoMagic,3c4n4g,Bwignite24,3,Sat Jul 4 19:31:36 2015 UTC,"So d-league players? random college kids? also, do the white/blue teams stick with the same roster the whole time?"
OrlandoMagic,3c4n4g,johnkphotos,4,Sat Jul 4 19:32:42 2015 UTC,"I think mostly d-leaguers, if not completely d-leaguers. I believe the rosters will remain the same throughout the summer league. I see it as the Blue team being the team they know will succeed, and the White team being the team they hope will have a hidden gem."
OrlandoMagic,3c4n4g,kManwoody,3,Sat Jul 4 19:40:10 2015 UTC,"No, ORL White has some prospects that are not in the league, while ORL Blue has all our NBA players and prospects too."

OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,UpvotesArePeople,7,Sat Jul 4 23:07:57 2015 UTC,Cash and rights to swap 2019 second round picks. Not much of a deal but I guess it's something.

OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,CaptainBananaFish,2,Sat Jul 4 23:36:27 2015 UTC,Don't really have any leverage.  Clearly we weren't going to match the offer.  Seems like it was either that minuscule return or nothing.
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,REEB,5,Sun Jul 5 00:00:56 2015 UTC,It's a shame because 4 million per year is nothing under the new cap terms. He probably wanted out. We've got a lot of players who will get minutes at the 4 and 5 next season... it's like we did him a solid by allowing him to go somewhere he'll actually get consistent minutes instead of matching and forcing him to sit games.
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,BigChiefWiggum,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:12:13 2015 UTC,Do we have  a lot of players at the 4/5?  Vuc Dedmon Frye AG  am I missing anyone?
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,REEB,2,Sun Jul 5 14:09:17 2015 UTC,Harris. Skiles said both Harris and AG will play more 4 this year.
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,BigChiefWiggum,2,Sun Jul 5 14:18:29 2015 UTC,"Knew I forgot him!  I do really hope we don't start Frye at the 4. AG has earned it and I feel like we would stunt his growth having him off the bench this year.  He is closer to the type of player we need next to Vuc.  Having a second unit like:  Watson  Fournier  Hezonja  Frye  Dedmon  is a pretty well balanced line up.  Decent defensively, with a lot of ball handling and shooting options."
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,Lauxman,2,Sun Jul 5 14:22:44 2015 UTC,"Problem is, Payton / Oladipo / Harris / AG / Vucevic is that we have the worst spacing of any team in the NBA, and no offense with the lack of shooting."
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,Don_Butter_Me_Knots,2,Sun Jul 5 15:19:47 2015 UTC,Hopefully that shooting coach that Payton and Gordon have been working will make this a much more viable line up.
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,Fatal_Conceit,8,Sun Jul 5 15:26:57 2015 UTC,"A sad day for everyone here. But at least we won't have to watch O'quinn rot on the bench, even if I feel like he led the hype train. I know Ill be cheering him on no matter what"
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,TheLastMango,7,Sat Jul 4 23:13:29 2015 UTC,"Kind of let down.  KOQ played much better than the 2nd round pick he was supposed to be, and now all we get is another?"
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,mjridiculouz,3,Sat Jul 4 23:17:32 2015 UTC,Nope we can only swap the 2nd rounder which means that it only benefits us if we are better than NYK in 2019.
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,TheLastMango,2,Sat Jul 4 23:20:28 2015 UTC,So it's even worse?
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,Ninja_Tomato,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:39:10 2015 UTC,"Oh it gets worse.  The Knicks owe their second round pick to the 76s that year, but they also have the rights to the Cavs and Rockets' second round pick, so we will likely get the best between those two teams."
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,mjridiculouz,7,Sun Jul 5 14:38:56 2015 UTC,I would've paid 4$ million to keep O'Quinn on the roster for chemistry reasons. But man we got like nothing from this trade.  AND WHATS WORSE IS THAT THIS OPENS UP A SPOT FOR QUINCY ACY csdkjcfsdjklhfsdfkjsdhfkdjfhdskfdj
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,bizort,2,Sat Jul 4 23:17:59 2015 UTC,I was thinking it opened up more time for Aaron Gordon. The most I've seen on an Acy-Orlando connection is that the Magic were one of like 5 teams showing a bit of interest.
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,PessimisticCheer,6,Sun Jul 5 09:39:10 2015 UTC,"Knicks fan here, fellas. What are we getting in O'Quinn?  P.S. I'm a fan of the Hezonja pick."
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,Fatal_Conceit,9,Sat Jul 4 23:24:01 2015 UTC,A solid glue guy and an absolute fan favorite.
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,whtge8,7,Sat Jul 4 23:37:44 2015 UTC,"Lean mean fouling machine. But seriously he is a good mid range shooter, good rebounder, excellent passer from the post, decent defender too."
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,nueve,6,Sat Jul 4 23:25:25 2015 UTC,You're getting the best beard in the business.
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,Shapedhifter4tw,3,Sat Jul 4 23:59:32 2015 UTC,Acy might have something to say about that
OrlandoMagic,3c5bwg,rippleffect81,2,Sun Jul 5 00:13:07 2015 UTC,"A hard worker with limited ceiling.  Can hustle, rebound, box out, shoot mid range and get put - backs, however sporadically for all categories. More consistent  minutes may help his growth, but for some reason I doubt it."

OrlandoMagic,3c4vmi,REEB,14,Sat Jul 4 20:27:27 2015 UTC,5 of those rebounds came on one play.  Vuc would be proud.
OrlandoMagic,3c4vmi,CaptainBananaFish,4,Sat Jul 4 21:48:41 2015 UTC,Did all those tips count as shot attempts too?
OrlandoMagic,3c4vmi,VanceIX,6,Sat Jul 4 23:11:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, each one was a board and FGA.  So, 5 boards, 5 FGA and 1 FGM in about 4 seconds."
OrlandoMagic,3c4vmi,OllieWillie,4,Sun Jul 5 00:34:35 2015 UTC,I believe so.
OrlandoMagic,3c4vmi,CaptainBananaFish,5,Sat Jul 4 23:14:35 2015 UTC,"As would Vuc's mentor, Zydrunas Ilgauskas.  Seriously, though, this gave me a good chuckle. Well done."
OrlandoMagic,3c4vmi,bigduck24,20,Sun Jul 5 03:42:39 2015 UTC,"I may be in the minority, but if this is a sign of things to come with Gordon, I'd rather have him starting and getting time than having Milsap."
OrlandoMagic,3c4vmi,bobbydigital_ftw,16,Sat Jul 4 20:48:25 2015 UTC,You are definitely not alone.
OrlandoMagic,3c4vmi,Steadfastred21,6,Sat Jul 4 21:03:29 2015 UTC,"That would give us a hell of a shooting bench mob with Watson/Fournier/Hezonja/Frye.  Goddamn, I'm excited!"
OrlandoMagic,3c4vmi,CaptainBananaFish,2,Sat Jul 4 23:15:41 2015 UTC,"I thought with Skiles coming over, we'd go back into 90's basketball with half-court, defense oriented stuff. But, with the way the roster is shaping up, he may be going into a more uptempo style. If we can just get some accountability on defense, we can be a playoff threat at 6-8."
OrlandoMagic,3c4vmi,houseQM,5,Sun Jul 5 04:17:12 2015 UTC,He went a little cold in the middle tho and I really want to see that get better before I put all my trust into him
OrlandoMagic,3c4vmi,Madhairman12,5,Sat Jul 4 22:15:20 2015 UTC,"Jesus that was impressive... I love how he was taking so many contested jumpers too. I mean, I hope he's not doing that mid season, but it shows how far he's come over the offseason.  He had the hot hand early and just kept backing himself.  If he can develop an average shot, no better, his athleticism, work ethic, attitude and defensive desire will make him a very very good NBA player. Matrix II type."
OrlandoMagic,3c4vmi,OllieWillie,6,Sun Jul 5 00:32:28 2015 UTC,"Coming from a Heat fan - I think this kid is going to be very good. A very versatile player which is important in today's league. If he develops a solid 3pt shot, he could be a more athletic Draymond Green."
OrlandoMagic,3c4vmi,y0ungw0lf,4,Sun Jul 5 02:51:50 2015 UTC,"With a young group of Payton, Hezonja, Gordon, Oladipo, Harris, Fournier, and Vucevic, the Magic are going for a long time once they get going. Not even a fan of the Magic but they are going to be fun to watch."
OrlandoMagic,3c4vmi,ChairyCweed,3,Sun Jul 5 03:27:53 2015 UTC,"I like what we're seeing, but he missed alot of free throws this game including two at the end."
OrlandoMagic,3c4vmi,Doofatronic,3,Sat Jul 4 22:43:18 2015 UTC,Don't give two shits about the points. All I care about from Aaron Gordon is Rebounds and Defense. Rest is lagniappe.
OrlandoMagic,3c4vmi,RWJ1985,3,Sun Jul 5 05:05:05 2015 UTC,Been working on that shot i see.  His offensive rebounding is going to provide us with a lot of second chance points.
OrlandoMagic,3c4vmi,Steadfastred21,-5,Sat Jul 4 20:51:57 2015 UTC,dead sub is dead.. s/o to the few in here that actually care about their team
OrlandoMagic,3c4zde,REEB,9,Sat Jul 4 21:02:02 2015 UTC,That hustle-steal pass to Payton and then lob to Gordon is basically what I want to happen ever possession next season.
OrlandoMagic,3c4zde,CaptainBananaFish,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:08:22 2015 UTC,"I think he looked great for his first taste of NBA action, to take and make the game winning three in your first ever NBA summer league game is an awesome sign to see. I guess the confidence he was said to have isn't a fluke"
OrlandoMagic,3c4nh2,farcicalbison,10,Sat Jul 4 19:11:22 2015 UTC,"That release is just so pretty, liked what I saw from him today. Got his looks, but didn't force much. And he's only been in the States for 2 days!"
OrlandoMagic,3c4nh2,VanceIX,7,Sat Jul 4 19:13:54 2015 UTC,"Seeing him at the end getting high-fives from everyone. I don't see a kid with attitude problems, I see a fiery competitor who gets along with his teammates. Can't wait to see more from Mario!"
OrlandoMagic,3c5d2c,CorsoKO,5,Sat Jul 4 23:17:38 2015 UTC,"He is good on offense as long as you don't let him shoot 3s. No idea why we let him do that after he beasted the previous year. He can hit mid range, pass very well out of high post, and works hard on boards and scoring near the basket. On defense he gives you hustle, rebounding, shot blocking and some rim protection. He's got length but he's not that athletic and can be a little slow. His biggest issue is fouling. If he can cut them down he can be a solid starter on an average team. If not, you'll still love him off the bench and just shake your head when he clobbers people. Great pickup, I think it's worth it considering the cap rise. 4 mil per will be nothing for a well rounded backup."
OrlandoMagic,3c5d2c,REEB,3,Sat Jul 4 23:43:17 2015 UTC,"Kyle is a decent mid range shooter. Hits the occasional three. Solid defense for someone off the bench. High energy guy who hustles. Definitely an upgrade over Quincy Acy, and definitely worth his contract considering the cap increase. As for Moe, when he plays he delivers for the most part. For whatever reason he barely played last season. The game where we played the Mavericks on ESPN he showed what he is capable of. Hopefully he will show he belongs in the NBA under Scott Skiles. I'm rooting for both of them."
OrlandoMagic,3c5d2c,eldonhorvito,3,Sat Jul 4 23:50:57 2015 UTC,"I think O'Quinn is a bit of a gem. His one big flaw as a player is a lack of athleticism but he's improved every season and added a 3 point shot last season, although it's not a very good looking shot and kind of inconsistent. He's a good rebounder and 1 on 1 low post defender. He's also a surprisingly good passer with good vision for his position. Overall he's unspectacular but solid, and a nice midrange jumper. I was worried Orlando would lose him but I think they want Aaron Gordon to play more so it makes sense. He's a steal at 4/$16, in my opinion. You did well.  Harkless, on the other hand, doesn't do anything well and hasn't really improved much. His 3 point percentage went up from year 1 to 2 but the shot itself isn't much better so I expected that sophomore season to be a bit of a mirage and I think it's proven to be. His ceiling is Trevor Ariza, which is adequate but I doubt he even approaches that level. I expect him to be out of the league in two years. To his credit, he seems like a good kid and an amazing athlete but I don't think he's a very good basketball player. The coaches stopped playing him once better options came along and I think he gives a very nonchalant attitude, which might be undeserved, to be honest, but that's how he comes across and it doesn't help him."
OrlandoMagic,3c5d2c,bizort,4,Sun Jul 5 08:52:32 2015 UTC,KOQ will give you a FEW decent minutes a game. He loves mid range but is very inconsistent. Added three ball last year but barely shot much. Slightly improved last year but I definitely do not think he is worth 4/16. I hope he proves me wrong. Harkless got no playing time last year and lost all of his confidence. I sincerely hope he can improve his game this year.
OrlandoMagic,3c5d2c,chriszzz,3,Sat Jul 4 23:23:00 2015 UTC,Ok well I'll be hoping for the best.  This guy was totally not on my radar as a potential signing.  I guess Phil sees something in him.
OrlandoMagic,3c5d2c,calvertical,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:30:24 2015 UTC,"KOQ will give you 12 good minutes a game.  Doesn't matter if you play him 12 minutes or 48 minutes in total, you're gonna get 12 good minutes and that's it."
OrlandoMagic,3c4ath,DRmanhattanJR,7,Sat Jul 4 17:17:51 2015 UTC,It's only game 1 of the pre-pre-season but he already looks noticeably more comfortable and confident out there.  He was 18 when we drafted him and is just 19 now. Imagine him getting better and better each year until his prime...dude could be insanely good.
OrlandoMagic,3c4ath,clown-from-neck-down,5,Sat Jul 4 18:06:38 2015 UTC,"I am so pumped, he looked amazing!! His handles and confidence are great.  Henzonja is off to a slow start, but I expect him to improve as he becomes more comfortable with the team."
OrlandoMagic,3c4ath,klassik891,0,Sat Jul 4 17:40:50 2015 UTC,"I think Mario is just playing a little timid because he still has games to play in Spain. Not that I endorse it, but getting hurt during the Spanish playoffs would not be good for him.  I'll become more critical once the real season starts."
OrlandoMagic,3c4ath,Swish28,8,Sat Jul 4 18:02:31 2015 UTC,What? We bought him out of his contract so I don't think he would still be in the playoffs unless the contract situation is different from my knowledge.
OrlandoMagic,3c4ath,klassik891,4,Sat Jul 4 19:21:07 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I thought that he still had to finish out the last few games but apparently not. My b."
OrlandoMagic,3c4ath,shamguard,2,Sat Jul 4 22:55:33 2015 UTC,Payton's play is really worrying me. Seems disengaged after that 1st quarter.
OrlandoMagic,3c4ath,albinorhino21,5,Sat Jul 4 18:34:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but he still had 9 assists (5 bad TOs - he looked a bit sluggish towards the beginning with 3 early ones).  I like that he shot those 3's without hesitating. 1/3 isn't great or anything, but he looks like he is a threat to shoot which is what we need."
OrlandoMagic,3c4ath,abujad,4,Sat Jul 4 19:01:14 2015 UTC,"Aaron needed a year to develop with the magic coaching staff, that jumper looks much more fluid.  Why is this Harvey dude hogging it so much though?"
OrlandoMagic,3c4ath,whtge8,5,Sat Jul 4 17:54:05 2015 UTC,"Wants to earn his roster spot, probably just a little too excited in his first game."

OrlandoMagic,3c3pyr,stinx2001,9,Sat Jul 4 13:54:25 2015 UTC,I did not expect us to get him for this cheap. Granted I expected 6 or 7 million so it's not a huge difference but I expected that we had to overpay for him to come to a 25 win team. Bring back KOQ and I say that our FA has been very good.
OrlandoMagic,3c3pyr,mjridiculouz,2,Sat Jul 4 14:01:10 2015 UTC,I'd rather not have KOQ back. He has been less productive for us than Glen Davis. That's not saying a lot. We should consider letting him leave. Why throw money at a player we don't want or need in any way
OrlandoMagic,3c3pyr,orlrdvxl,3,Sat Jul 4 21:00:06 2015 UTC,And you're on the money... Off to NYK
OrlandoMagic,3c3pyr,OllieWillie,6,Sat Jul 4 23:51:30 2015 UTC,Haven't seen him play much. What kind of game does he have?

OrlandoMagic,3c3pyr,Ispentthatbread,5,Sat Jul 4 13:55:26 2015 UTC,So no Jameer?
OrlandoMagic,3c3pyr,bobbydigital_ftw,5,Sat Jul 4 15:06:55 2015 UTC,Excellent deal considering Dallas and LAC were after him.
OrlandoMagic,3c3pyr,REEB,4,Sat Jul 4 15:19:35 2015 UTC,"This caught me a little off guard but I'm pretty happy with this after a little thought. He's a solid PG, brings scoring off the bench, obligatory ""cap is going up so this contract is actually like $0.0001"", and he's actually a PG unlike everyone minus Elfrid.. at least this means Fournier won't be bringing the ball up the court anymore.   Wish we could have nabbed a competent big man, but the core looks like it's established now and the depth is getting better, going to be exciting the next few years."
OrlandoMagic,3c3pyr,DFSFisherman,3,Sat Jul 4 16:01:20 2015 UTC,This is the best backup PG we have had in many years. This is a really good signing.
OrlandoMagic,3c3pyr,Ellimistopher,4,Sat Jul 4 21:39:20 2015 UTC,Otis always gets his man...granted I'd of preferred CJ those 4-5 seasons ago but this is a solid signing.   The 3-point shooting in the second unit is going to be pretty potent.

OrlandoMagic,3c49u9,chuku007,10,Sat Jul 4 17:17:19 2015 UTC,Based off this half alone I would say it's safe to say Gordon will be most improved and an allstar. Maybe even executive of the year.

OrlandoMagic,3c49u9,mjridiculouz,2,Sat Jul 4 18:54:19 2015 UTC,Why didn't LAC drive it to the basket with 8 fuckin seconds left?
OrlandoMagic,3c49u9,mjridiculouz,2,Sat Jul 4 18:56:56 2015 UTC,"Damn, that was amazing. SO HYPED!"
OrlandoMagic,3c49u9,mjridiculouz,2,Sat Jul 4 18:58:01 2015 UTC,Man Mario with what felt like an eternity without  touching the ball hitting that last 3 pointer... I can get used to this
OrlandoMagic,3c49u9,ajax0626,2,Sat Jul 4 18:59:02 2015 UTC,Really liked that Hezonja 3 with 12 seconds.  AG's shot was on point... gotta make his FTs though.
OrlandoMagic,3c3uzc,ominating,6,Sat Jul 4 14:47:24 2015 UTC,Don't forget the game winner vs the Hawks... Millsap tried to help on Harris' shot and failed.
OrlandoMagic,3c3uzc,REEB,5,Sat Jul 4 15:17:58 2015 UTC,Maybe thats why he didn't sign with us :(
OrlandoMagic,3c3uzc,AFewBlackMen,6,Sat Jul 4 15:05:52 2015 UTC,It's probably why he even gave us the time of day. ;)
OrlandoMagic,3c3uzc,REEB,3,Sat Jul 4 15:18:18 2015 UTC,That man used us for leverage :'(
OrlandoMagic,3c3uzc,xiedian,-5,Sat Jul 4 15:30:16 2015 UTC,"IMHO, we overpaid.  We should of traded him and brought in someone like Ryan Anderson along with another point guard.  Then try to offload Frye along with a few other pieces of deadwood.   Give our picks some starting minutes and then go all in for Durant next year.  If we needed to sign a veteran presence we should of went for David West (two year deal).    Lineup for 2015/2016:   Payton, Oladipo, Anderson, West, Vucevic (starting five)  Watson, Fournier, Hezonja, Gordon, Dedmon (substitutions)   Starting Lineup for 2016/2017:   Payton, Oladipo, Hezonja, Durant, Vucevic  or  Payton, Oladipo, Durant, West, Vucevic (more defensive)"
OrlandoMagic,3c3uzc,Steadfastred21,3,Sat Jul 4 16:48:35 2015 UTC,"Why would Durant come here? No strong evidence he leaves OKC.  and if he does,  why would he go to a shittier team?"
OrlandoMagic,3c3uzc,Greatjonunchained,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:02:14 2015 UTC,"Show him the money and get him a ticket to the Eastern Conference.  Unfortunately, if he was going to any team in the east it would be Washington but that doesn't mean we can't try.  Besides, the way the team is shaping up, we have one the best young cores in the east and i wouldn't be surprised if we ended up making a playoff push this season.  So if the team is willing to pay him max money and reflect a championship attitude then i'd say we have a more than decent chance to sign him.  If not, no foul.  At least we can say the front office showed some ambition by trying something ballsy in the market.  We've got plenty of talent on the team but need more pieces to fill our O/D gaps."
OrlandoMagic,3c3uzc,Steadfastred21,2,Sat Jul 4 20:28:07 2015 UTC,We didn't overpay nearly as badly as we would have if Millsap signed that lotto ticket we offered him.
OrlandoMagic,3c3uzc,subutaime,3,Sat Jul 4 20:01:08 2015 UTC,I don't know what the FO is thinking sometimes.  The Frye deal made me nauseous.  I just don't think Harris is worth that kind of money.  Vucevic (borderline all-star) makes less than him and has a more all-round game than him.
OrlandoMagic,3c3uzc,Steadfastred21,0,Sat Jul 4 20:39:32 2015 UTC,It has happened for years here in the O. We Overpay for mediocre talent bc sometimes that's all we can get.
OrlandoMagic,3c3x8v,REEB,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:09:53 2015 UTC,The Knicks are still working on building the structure/system/culture of the team. I see them trying to come after Tobias within the next couple of yrs
OrlandoMagic,3c4peg,CaneGang24,7,Sat Jul 4 19:30:06 2015 UTC,of course. I think we can be a 6-8 seed this year.
OrlandoMagic,3c4peg,johnkphotos,4,Sat Jul 4 19:30:26 2015 UTC,I think 6 is a bit of reach but I'm thinking 8 seed is reasonable
OrlandoMagic,3c4peg,Madhairman12,3,Sat Jul 4 19:33:44 2015 UTC,agreed.  TBH I think:  30% we don't make the playoffs  60% we're 8 seed  10% 7 or 6
OrlandoMagic,3c4peg,johnkphotos,4,Sat Jul 4 19:35:06 2015 UTC,"The Magic will be better. But it's hard to expect us to realistically make the playoffs when I feel confident in saying that these teams will have a better record than us in Cleveland, Miami, Washington, Chicago, Milwaukee, And Atlanta. That leaves 3 spots open and I didn't even include Toronto who should probably be in that mix but I have a feeling they might blow it up this year if they have a bad start.  That leaves only one spot open (the 8th) and we will have to compete with the likes of Brooklyn, Boston, Indiana, and Detroit. I do believe that we have a better roster than all 4 of those teams but it only takes one surprise for one of them to fill out that 8th spot like D-Will becoming D-Will again or Boston's teamwork succeeding for a 2nd year or Paul George coming back in Paul George form or Stan Van Gundy's system working wonders in Detroit."
OrlandoMagic,3c4peg,mjridiculouz,2,Sat Jul 4 20:30:49 2015 UTC,The pacers are undoubtedly making the playoffs this year. Paul George will be healthy and they've signed Monta Ellis
OrlandoMagic,3c4peg,the34thofdecember,3,Sun Jul 5 00:29:24 2015 UTC,In all seriousness it will be a battle between our two teams. Can't wait to play you guys!
OrlandoMagic,3c4peg,IceGeek,2,Sat Jul 4 21:48:18 2015 UTC,My bet is Orlando competes for the 8 seed but ultimately misses down the stretch. New York on the other hand doesn't even smell that sort of success. What did you bet?
OrlandoMagic,3c4peg,zadnik22,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:34:24 2015 UTC,"I would favor the Magic doing better but it really depends on how well the Zingis plays, and how much effort Melo dedicates to carrying the team night in and night out."

OrlandoMagic,3c5m8h,whtge8,4,Sun Jul 5 03:00:35 2015 UTC,"Heya. He's on a huge wage this season, but it expires. Orlando need a rim protector bad, which is all Roy is good for. Striking out on Milsap with no alternative leaves a financial hole that could be filled.   Or just save the money and give Dedmond more minutes.   Which is probs smarter. Ok I'm out"
OrlandoMagic,3c5m8h,TweetPoster,5,Sun Jul 5 01:01:21 2015 UTC,Hibbert is strictly a center. I don't think moving Vucevic to the 4 would be a good idea.
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,ajax0626,20,Sat Jul 4 02:39:55 2015 UTC,"He sure did want out, Michael Scotto..."
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,jive_turkey,11,Sat Jul 4 02:45:48 2015 UTC,Just people trying to get their name out there by spreading false rumors.
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,whtge8,12,Sat Jul 4 02:48:34 2015 UTC,Glad to hear. Really excited to see our team develop.
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,whtge8,5,Sat Jul 4 02:41:50 2015 UTC,"Payton - Oladipo - Harris - Gordon/Frye - Vucevic  With Mario, O'Quinn, and Frye/Gordon stacking the second team. I haven't been this hyped for a season since before Dwight left!"
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,VanceIX,5,Sat Jul 4 03:49:22 2015 UTC,And Fournier coming off the bench
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,anonymousacg,5,Sat Jul 4 03:53:57 2015 UTC,"Damn, can't believe I left out Fournier! Hopefully we can get a decent backup PG (crossing my fingers for Nelson), then the second team will really be set.  Assuming KOQ gets resigned, of course."
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,VanceIX,3,Sat Jul 4 03:55:43 2015 UTC,"Also it may be wishful thinking, but I still have hope that Harkless will find a spot in our rotation as well"

OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,abujad,2,Sat Jul 4 06:49:47 2015 UTC,"Aaron Gordon. Either he or Frye could end up being the starter (though I think Aaron is most likely), so I listed both just in case."

OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,Orlandipo3,2,Sat Jul 4 02:42:14 2015 UTC,Is that the max?
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,AndrewFlash,2,Sat Jul 4 03:03:42 2015 UTC,"Might be for him with his years in the league, haven't seen an answer on this sub or on /r/nba."

OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,amoebas4breakfast,6,Sat Jul 4 02:53:00 2015 UTC,Great lock up. Time to move forward and get these boys growing as a team. Great times ahead of us
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,BrotherBroseph,6,Sat Jul 4 02:52:30 2015 UTC,"I'm glad we could keep him, the chemistry he already has with the team is invaluable imo"
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,hostileprostitute,3,Sat Jul 4 03:06:38 2015 UTC,"Peyton, Dipo, Mario, Harris, vuc? Evan and frye off the bench for shooting and Gordon for energy?"
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,Orlandipo3,6,Sat Jul 4 02:54:33 2015 UTC,Gordon at PF and Mario off the bench
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,hostileprostitute,-3,Sat Jul 4 03:13:32 2015 UTC,That a whole lot of no offense
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,Orlandipo3,5,Sat Jul 4 03:28:05 2015 UTC,Harris/Vuc/Oladipo all average over 16ppg. it's about style of offense and defense. Harris is limited at the 4 defensively. AG excels there and in rebounding. If AG can become an average 3pt shooter it'll stretch the floor for Oladipo and Payton to slash
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,hostileprostitute,0,Sat Jul 4 03:30:22 2015 UTC,Averaging PPG doesn't matter when you win less then 30 games.
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,ultranonymous11,3,Sat Jul 4 04:17:40 2015 UTC,Harris and Vuc provide a ton of offense by themselves. Dipo had gotten better and I see no reason why he wouldn't improve this year too. And Elf is the conductor leading the offense. I see no issue with that lineup whatsoever.
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,hostileprostitute,0,Sat Jul 4 03:31:36 2015 UTC,Do you think Scott is the variable that changes the equation?
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,HakunaMatata023,2,Sat Jul 4 04:35:23 2015 UTC,"I think this should be the lineup and hope it is, I just like him better at the 4 especially with the whole small ball phase taking place and I like it for Gordon so he's not rushed into the lineup and can learn some from Harris, at least offensively. Probably will see Harris play both positions throughout the season depending on who's hot, who's available, and who they are playing."
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,EyeoftheTyga,4,Sat Jul 4 05:48:44 2015 UTC,"tbh, I was so confident he was gonna leave. Nice to see we didn't even have to match"
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,ofmanv,3,Sat Jul 4 05:53:28 2015 UTC,"64 mil is a lot of money over four years, but cap space isn't going to matter for the next 4 years, at least for Orlando."
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,WadeOverLeBron,2,Sat Jul 4 03:31:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's a great deal for us.  22 year old averaging 17-7, 16 mil a year is awesome."
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,HakunaMatata023,3,Sat Jul 4 04:16:42 2015 UTC,"Ya I like this deal, wasn't too happy with the thought of giving him the max so I'm glad they got him for a good bit under."
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,Scottydoesntknowyou,0,Sat Jul 4 05:52:01 2015 UTC,"That is his max, he had less than 6 years of service."
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,HakunaMatata023,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:43:14 2015 UTC,No the max was a few million more then what he took. There's even reports saying how the Kings offered him a max contract but he chose to take less money to stay with Orlando. He's apparently 1 of 5 players to turn down more money from the Kings and sign for less with someone else.
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,svanxx,2,Sat Jul 4 19:46:17 2015 UTC,Especially when the rumors was him getting 20 mil a year.
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,whtge8,3,Sat Jul 4 05:20:56 2015 UTC,Can someone tell me what our cap space looks like after this? Can we still offer a max contract next year? I assume we will resign Oladipo to a max extension. Will we still have room for a big free agent?
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,mjridiculouz,3,Sat Jul 4 03:40:08 2015 UTC,I did the math earlier and I think I estimated us with around $28 million which should be enough to max Durant or Horford which would be the two ideal targets.
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,onlysame1,2,Sat Jul 4 03:50:51 2015 UTC,"Before the Harris signing, we were at $44 million. This was including Mario. With Harris signed, we should now be at $60 million.  Not sure how much it will cost to get Watson and O'Quinn but either way, next summer we should have more than enough to go after a max player based on the higher salary cap predictions."
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,REEB,2,Sat Jul 4 06:28:50 2015 UTC,No player options in the deal.
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,PeroPej,2,Sat Jul 4 03:30:44 2015 UTC,"Great re-signing, let's now set our sights on some other free agents available, preferably a rim protector."
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,Goshawk3118191,2,Sat Jul 4 05:40:55 2015 UTC,"It's been absolutely hilarious going to the /r/nba post and reading salty ass Laker fans talk about how they're glad they didn't ""overpay for a mediocre player"" and ""whatever just leaves us better set for the next free agency"". Absolutely delicious."
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,BroganTrundler,2,Sat Jul 4 07:47:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, get in! Now we won't be getting those daily ""Tobias Harris?"" threads."
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,jarkarawr,2,Sat Jul 4 08:27:16 2015 UTC,"Too bad we didn't get Milsap and Harris. Oh well. Even though I'm not the biggest fan of Harris, I'm glad we kept him. I think he's a good piece for us especially right now when most of our guys are so young like Gordon. At the absolute least Harris will be a great stopgap till our other guys are ready to step up. Best case he continues to develop especially on defense and this becomes a great value contact. Definitely excited to see us grow this season."
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,theboss232123,-10,Sat Jul 4 12:36:06 2015 UTC,this sub is dead. you should be more happy

OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,jarkarawr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:55:24 2015 UTC,Realistically the only other teams we should be compared to are smaller market teams that have been towards the bottom of the lease like us lately. I personally don't care how active other teams are or how little activity there is on here. At least there are other people commenting so there's other people we can talk about our team with. Would it be nice if there were more people? Sure. Is it a problem or is this sub dead? Absolutely not.
OrlandoMagic,3c2b5k,theboss232123,-1,Sat Jul 4 12:39:32 2015 UTC,nearly 200 comments in the Bucks sub after they signed Monroe.. Only 50 here. I guess Orlando isn't a basketball hub.
OrlandoMagic,3c4lah,PunkAaron,4,Sat Jul 4 18:53:09 2015 UTC,Resign O'Quinn or find another rim protector.
OrlandoMagic,3c4lah,ErmacAnd1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:00:46 2015 UTC,I'd rather find another rim protector.  O'Quinn has his days but for the most part he's non-existent.
OrlandoMagic,3c4lah,Steadfastred21,2,Sat Jul 4 21:13:51 2015 UTC,I'm just kinda sad we missed out on Milsap.  I was so against the idea of maxing out a FA but it never occurred to me that we could do that and then go over the cap retaining Harris.  That would have been dope.
OrlandoMagic,3c4lah,CaptainBananaFish,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:02:27 2015 UTC,"I don't care how they do it but Frye should go.  It's too bad because no one is going to pick up that horrendous contract.  We got our back-up point guard.  I think we just need to find someone to do some dirty work in the paint as well as a prolific shooter (preferably in the frontcourt).  For shooters i was thinking about Anderson (free agent next year) and Teletovic.  As for paint defenders, we could try for someone like West or Smith."
OrlandoMagic,3c2o1h,whtge8,6,Sat Jul 4 04:53:52 2015 UTC,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WE ARE GONNA GET A SOLID BACKUP POINT GUARD! It's not Nelson but i'll take it!

And from 18 to being about to turn 23 now, I’m a completely different player. Even in Milwaukee, where I didn’t play as much, we still had a great dialogue. He just wanted me to work harder. He just said, ‘Your time is coming.’ So he was always encouraging for me.  “Today, we communicated. He wants me to be a leader. He wants me to lead. He’s a fantastic coach. I think he’s the perfect coach for our team. Actually, I know he’s the perfect coach for our team. And he’s a coach I want to play for. He’s a fiery guy. He gets after you. He has that passion to win, that fire to win. Me and him, we have no problems. That passion, that’s the passion that I play with, so that’s what I love in a coach.”"

I'll probably do the same this year. Jus sayin  Edit: Watched only the first half of today's SL game but had to get to 4th of july festivities. I'll catch the other 3 and do a full write up on those. I'll add some comments from today's game in the first full one I do.
OrlandoMagic,3c1yzy,Big_Apple3AM,3,Sat Jul 4 01:01:38 2015 UTC,That would be great! I'm going to try my best to watch them but unsure how available it will be to watch. I can't wait to read them.
OrlandoMagic,3c1yzy,ultranonymous11,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:08:35 2015 UTC,Yea that would be great man.
OrlandoMagic,3c1yzy,Ispentthatbread,5,Sat Jul 4 01:43:25 2015 UTC,Want to see how Elf's shot is coming along. Hopefully there is noticeable improvement
OrlandoMagic,3c1yzy,ajax0626,5,Sat Jul 4 00:57:23 2015 UTC,"Just remember that it is Summer League. The point isn't to win games. Also, remember the small sample size. If Aaron Gordon shoots 8/10 from 3 over the course of the League, don't assume he'll shoot 40% this year. Conversely, if he shoots 0/10, don't assume he can't hit 35% this year."
OrlandoMagic,3c1yzy,ajax0626,5,Sat Jul 4 03:17:44 2015 UTC,Ok I know I said this but these Aaron Gordon Jumpers are making me extremely erect.
OrlandoMagic,3c1yzy,amoebas4breakfast,4,Sat Jul 4 17:08:42 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm most excited to see Aaron Gordon's growth and what Tyler Harvey can bring to the table. Really wanna see what Rice can do and if the White team has any surprises."
OrlandoMagic,3c1yzy,twisted-logic,3,Sat Jul 4 00:49:12 2015 UTC,"I'm really excited to see what Hezonja brings to the team. Obviously we've seen his highlights with Barca, but I want to watch him play here. Hoping to watch him drop 3 bombs all over the place and some highlight dunks. Should be some exciting fastbreaks with EP, VO, AG and Hez."
OrlandoMagic,3c1yzy,mjridiculouz,2,Sat Jul 4 00:56:13 2015 UTC,"While I'm looking forward to him, I wouldn't expect/want to see him playing more than a few minutes each game, maybe starting 1 or 2 and sitting out the rest.   Kid's been playing in Europe, needs some rest before the season actually starts."
OrlandoMagic,3c1yzy,schultejt,2,Sat Jul 4 16:36:47 2015 UTC,I'll be watching to see if anybody has the talent of being a stretch 4 with rim protection because if they even show a little bit of that then they could definitely get a roster spot for our team.   For team blue though i'll be paying attention to Elfrid's aggressiveness to see if it's still there and also Aaron Gordon's shot creating ability since he will be one of the main option on offense and I want to see if he can even be decent in that role against other young players.  For team white I will get a better idea after the 1st game I watch but like I said i'm mainly looking for a stretch 4 that shows any skill of rim protecting and it's not just our summer league team but other SL teams as well that i'll be looking for this because it's a rare breed in the NBA that a TON of teams would desperately want.
OrlandoMagic,3c1yzy,BroganTrundler,2,Sat Jul 4 01:37:50 2015 UTC,"A player on the white team that is worth watching is Scottie Wilbekin.  In college he was a lock down defender who came in and was forced to play backup pg as barely a 17 year old and by the end of his college career averaged around 14pts and 4 assists per game, while winning SEC Player of the Year and leading the Gators to a Final 4.    In his first year as a pro he played in the Australian League for the Cairns Taipans.  He was the teams MVP and DPOY as a rookie and led them to a Finals berth where they eventually lost.  And this team was projected to be one of the worst in the Aussie League at the beginning of the season. Avereaged 15.2 pts, 4.3 assists and 1.1 steals.  While he's not a sharpshooter he hit 39% of his threes as a college senior and always seemed to hit a big shot in the clutch moments.  If he has a strong showing in Summer League he could slide in as Elfrid's backup because of his defense, while also being a shooter that at least has to be watched."
OrlandoMagic,3c2sm0,VictorOladeepthroat,5,Sat Jul 4 05:45:48 2015 UTC,He just finished a full season overseas. Plus he may have commitments to his national team this summer.

OrlandoMagic,3c0jjq,REEB,5,Fri Jul 3 17:40:55 2015 UTC,I dont know what to make of what Kyler says since he doesn't actually give out official news but we've been hearing nothing but good things about Tobias Harris and him wanting to stay with us outside of Michael Scotto to my knowledge.
OrlandoMagic,3c0jjq,mjridiculouz,3,Fri Jul 3 17:59:30 2015 UTC,Well we know kyler actually talks to Harris on a regular basis... so he's tweeting this based on conversations he's had with Harris and his camp. Who knows where Scotto gets his intel and what motives are behind his rumors. He's not reputable and he's not friendly with our players.
OrlandoMagic,3c0jjq,ipahopster,-1,Fri Jul 3 19:14:03 2015 UTC,I have not received the offers I was expecting so I rather stay in Orlando.

OrlandoMagic,3c0dvb,danielsilva12345,6,Fri Jul 3 22:11:30 2015 UTC,"The Orlando Magic are fielding two teams so there will be an even number of teams in the league. He will be on the blue team with Elf, Aaron, Dedmon, etc. The white team has no players that were on the roster last year."
OrlandoMagic,3c0dvb,danielsilva12345,5,Fri Jul 3 22:29:40 2015 UTC,so basically the white is gonna get destroyed?

OrlandoMagic,3bwxlo,ajax0626,3,Thu Jul 2 20:57:32 2015 UTC,I believe the first day of Summer League gets shown for free on the NBA app. At least it was last year.

OrlandoMagic,3bywci,illgetthere,5,Fri Jul 3 10:16:51 2015 UTC,"Possibly max. We struck out on Millsap, so we're likely matching."
OrlandoMagic,3bywci,REEB,9,Fri Jul 3 12:19:04 2015 UTC,Idk but whatever it is were resigning him
OrlandoMagic,3bywci,VictorOladeepthroat,2,Fri Jul 3 07:46:34 2015 UTC,"I'm a Piston fan but I live in Orlando so I have an interest in the Magic.  Honestly, if Harris knows whats good for him he'll stay with the Magic.  They're a young team who now have a coach who will get them playing really well this season.  His stock is only going to rise at this point.    Next year he can sign a hefty deal and probably only have to put up with Skiles another couple of years.  By then, hopefully, and I see no reason why not, they'll be a playoff team and can attract a higher level coach.  Teams like this who are young and work hard get much much better with time.    But this is in a perfect world where players aren't recruited away."
OrlandoMagic,3bywci,Timmyj01,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:44:09 2015 UTC,Teams aren't going to offer any RFA's until the 9th.
OrlandoMagic,3bx8v4,REEB,3,Thu Jul 2 22:18:54 2015 UTC,"Solid rebounder and scorer from what I can tell, but definitely not a shot-blocker or floor-spacer. 6'7"" and plays either forward spot. Would probably give us some toughness inside."
OrlandoMagic,3bx8v4,UpvotesArePeople,3,Thu Jul 2 22:37:22 2015 UTC,"Seems to love dunking and going for putbacks. He plays with energy and some toughness. I'd rather keep O'Quinn, but only if he reverted back to what he showed us in 2013-14."
OrlandoMagic,3bx8v4,rockinwithmycockout,3,Thu Jul 2 22:45:41 2015 UTC,"I'd be ok with signing Acy. He reminds me a lot of Bo Outlaw for some reason. Not very good at anything, but seems to play with more hustle than talent. He's not going to be that missing piece, obviously.   That kind of attitude can be contagious to a young team.   I do like KOQ more though..."
OrlandoMagic,3bx8v4,whtge8,2,Thu Jul 2 23:45:29 2015 UTC,Another undersized forward? I don't know about that. We need some more size.
OrlandoMagic,3bx8v4,GSN1PA360,2,Fri Jul 3 01:40:38 2015 UTC,"He's short, but he's longer and more athletic than draymond green who started at PF for a championship team. Height isn't everything. I think we're only interested in him as a backup anyway."
OrlandoMagic,3bx6ue,Orlandipo,5,Thu Jul 2 22:02:52 2015 UTC,"Not sure how I feel about the question, but I'll trust the system.  As a side note: AG looks like he bulked up a bit over the summer and improved his shot. Just this video gets me excited for this season!"

OrlandoMagic,3bvyvi,SamuelMuniz,5,Thu Jul 2 16:28:40 2015 UTC,Some interesting stuff. He had some nice things to say about Tyler Harvey's work ethic. I hope he works out.
OrlandoMagic,3bvyvi,Ellimistopher,5,Thu Jul 2 16:29:12 2015 UTC,"2nd round picks are always hopeful, they rarely end up working out."
OrlandoMagic,3bvyvi,VanceIX,2,Thu Jul 2 17:17:07 2015 UTC,"Well, he might end up being a decent backup PG down the road, especially if he can get some tutoring from a veteran like Jameer.   It's a long shot, but I'm crossing my fingers."
OrlandoMagic,3bvyvi,MelbourneFL321,-3,Thu Jul 2 18:59:05 2015 UTC,We don't need someone to mentor him on how to crank up desperate 3's that ruins the flow of an offense.
OrlandoMagic,3bvyvi,VanceIX,4,Thu Jul 2 19:24:27 2015 UTC,"Seeing as that he was the scoring leader in college, it's not his shooting that needs the most work. It's going to be learning how to control the pace and tempo of an NBA offense, and Jameer can give him plenty of tips for that (if he signs here)."
OrlandoMagic,3bvyvi,MelbourneFL321,3,Thu Jul 2 19:31:55 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind 'Meer as a backup PG for a year, I just was never a fan of him as our starting PG. He has a tendency to jack his own shots rather than run an offense. Which would work on nights he comes off the bench hot."
OrlandoMagic,3bvyvi,VanceIX,2,Thu Jul 2 19:34:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think Jameer would do much better as a backup at this point in his career. I think the problem with our offense when he was starting was that he was consistently the second or third best player behind Howard, so he kind of had to pick up the slack. Now he can just focus on running a relatively deep second team offense instead of trying to score."
OrlandoMagic,3bvyvi,goat_justinanderson,2,Thu Jul 2 19:46:30 2015 UTC,Hezonja averages 20
OrlandoMagic,3bvpvu,whtge8,4,Thu Jul 2 15:19:48 2015 UTC,"Didn't know much about him, but just did some digging...and I'm impressed. Averaged 2 blk/gm last season. His game kinda reminds me of Horace Grant. Anybody know any more about him? Did he start last year or come off the bench? Who could we give up for him?"
OrlandoMagic,3bvpvu,SamuelMuniz,3,Thu Jul 2 16:24:47 2015 UTC,"He came off the bench last year behind Sanders and eventually Zaza. Not sure why he didn't start, really good rebounder and rim protector. He only averaged 18 minutes per game last year, but his per36 were 13.8/9.1/1.7 with 4 blocks. He would be a great pickup for any team wanting a backup big, or even a starting one considering he only makes 2.9 mil a year."
OrlandoMagic,3bvpvu,ianiandinosour,3,Thu Jul 2 21:09:11 2015 UTC,"Nice rim protector. If we get him, does that mean we let O'Quinn go, or have Dedmon / O'Quinn / Henson as the backup bigs?"
OrlandoMagic,3bvpvu,houseQM,3,Thu Jul 2 17:05:40 2015 UTC,"He's too good at defense and fills a depth need for them. He's a very good rim protector and leads the league in block rate. Monroe/Giannis could both play alongside him during stretches, so I think they'll keep him for the year and match offers next summer."
OrlandoMagic,3bvpvu,REEB,3,Thu Jul 2 19:25:07 2015 UTC,I've wanted him ever since he destroyed us in the game where Tobias hit that crazy shot to force OT against the Bucks. Not sure if they'd be willing to give him up.
OrlandoMagic,3bvpvu,Swish28,4,Thu Jul 2 20:28:22 2015 UTC,I was at that game because it was Redick's first time coming back to the Amway Center after being traded. Good timessss
OrlandoMagic,3bvpvu,mjridiculouz,2,Thu Jul 2 20:41:00 2015 UTC,Mentioned this to a few buddies the other day. Ive always like hensen and he's been severely under utilized.  The only problems are that he's a hole on D and his FT shooting is on par with an amputee.
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,ultranonymous11,8,Thu Jul 2 14:47:05 2015 UTC,"I think we'll end up matching Tobias and letting it fly with the team we have, hoping for some solid improvement. And then throw a max offer at Al Horford next year just to piss off the Hawks."
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,IteLacerti,2,Thu Jul 2 15:06:32 2015 UTC,What does the PF free agent market look like next year?   As much as I love Horford because of his abilities and ties to UF I wouldn't want to rely on an aging Horford because of his injury history to be the player to put us over the top.
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,Swalrus,7,Thu Jul 2 19:32:45 2015 UTC,only person u listed that I would want is Jameer on possibly a 2 year deal.
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,thug_life4,5,Thu Jul 2 14:59:39 2015 UTC,"Jameer: Yes  Bass: No  Biyombo: No we have Dedmon  Robinson: No, He isn't good."
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,mjridiculouz,5,Thu Jul 2 15:00:31 2015 UTC,Biyombo is a much better defender than Dedmon since he can block more and foul less. Robinson would also help our bench... his rebound rate is insane and he's full of energy. I'd go after one of these guys for around $4-5 million (good value under the new cap terms).
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,REEB,3,Thu Jul 2 15:08:14 2015 UTC,OMD talked about Dedmon and how his analytical stats were similar to this years Noah/Dwight/Noel and a couple of other players that I can't remember but that sounds pretty good to me and the eye test for his play showed me he was a good rim protector for us. I just don't see the point in getting another Dedmon  As for Robinson. I mean if you want rebounding then sure but I rather get somebody who is decent at more than one thing.
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,mjridiculouz,5,Thu Jul 2 15:21:15 2015 UTC,"I'll take Zach Lowe's advice over a local blogger's. He has Biyombo in his short list of free agent steals. O'Quinn also made the list. Both these guys are better than Dedmon.  Dedmon has the third worst foul rate in the league among players who actually got time. He is nothing close to Noah/Dwight/Noel on defense as those guys can defend without fouling like crazy. Biyombo on the other hand can be included because he, too, can defend/block shots without getting penalized. Think of it this way... Vuc is not known as a good shot blocker or rim protector, but if he went crazy and started hacking people his defensive numbers would go up... but does that actually make him some great defender?"
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,REEB,3,Thu Jul 2 15:37:10 2015 UTC,Look I agree that Dedmon isn't on the level of the players I said defensively but I watched Dedmon play defense and he got the job done when he was out there. And why should fouling be a problem when it's a guy coming off the bench giving you 16 minutes? It was also his first year of actually getting playing time so he has room to adjust while O'Quinn was going on his 2nd year of consistent playing time and still hacked players like crazy and the only reason why he was on the court because he had an offensive game.  I can't say anything about Biyombo because I haven't paid attention to him but what I do know is that fans overhype Biyombo according to multiple experts so I rather believe the guy is overhyped over the non charlotte fans who are only judging him based off of articles and highlights instead of consistently watching him play. That's why I prefer Dedmon over him because I watched nearly every single Magic game and I was happy with what I saw from Dedmon defensively
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,mjridiculouz,4,Thu Jul 2 15:54:46 2015 UTC,"The foul issue is not about floor time. Block to foul rate is indicative of what kind of defense you're actually playing. Biyombo not only blocks more, he fouls less. He is way more accurate at blocking shots.   Dedmon turns 26 this summer. He may cut down on some mistakes on defense, but there likely won't be major changes. If he focuses too much on decreasing his fouls his blocks will come down. O'Quinn is a good example of this (more on this below).  O'Quinn's block and foul rates per 100 possessions in his 2nd year (3.8 blk / 7.1 fouls) were better than Dedmon's in his 2nd year (3 blk / 8.5 fouls). You know what happened when KOQ tried to reduce his fouling in his 3rd year? His block rate came down to 2.4... and even with the decrease he was still considered foul prone. So what does that make Dedmon whose foul rate is even higher? Compare those guys to Biyombo's numbers: 4.1 blk / 5.6 fouls per100. He's always blocked a lot of shots and he's never had a problem fouling even when he was a rookie at 19 years old. Btw, Biyombo will only be 23 next season.  I don't know how Biyombo can be over-hyped at this point in his career when nobody talked about him besides Lowe. There's a reason he's on his list of free agent STEALS. Also, Charlotte fans were pissed Biyombo was released. They loved the guy and thought he was the best defender on the team.  Dedmon is a solid big off the bench and I wouldn't just toss him aside for trash, but if we can upgrade at a reasonable price then we should do it. Biyombo IS an upgrade. You admitted you don't know much about Biyombo, so why not look into it first instead of settling for what you know?"
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,REEB,3,Thu Jul 2 17:45:21 2015 UTC,"Aren't bench players encouraged to come out and be aggressive in the paint?  Coach: ""Hey, dude. Come in the game and beat the shit out of their big men for a while."""
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,MagicN3rd,2,Thu Jul 2 18:00:05 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I don't think they're encouraged to be among the worst in the league at fouling. You still need some balance even if the leash is loosened somewhat. Biyombo was a backup and he didn't have to foul nearly as much to have a block rate among the best in the entire league. I'd rather turn defense into offense rather than simply sending opponents to the ft line to make them ""earn"" their points. Just because Dedmon is serviceable doesn't mean we can't easily upgrade him."
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,REEB,6,Thu Jul 2 19:42:15 2015 UTC,I want Robin Lopez  Edit: also like Amir Johnson and Kosta Koufos
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,ajax0626,2,Thu Jul 2 15:54:01 2015 UTC,Throw in unlimited Disney passes and he's probably ours!
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,IteLacerti,4,Thu Jul 2 16:03:15 2015 UTC,"I like the Robinson idea. He is still young, was a highly rated prospect, has a developed NBA skill (rebounding), and has huge chip on his shoulder. Worth a flier in my mind.  Biyombo I'm a little more skeptical about since he has zero offensive game. Better to focus on O'Quinn's development and see if he can turn into something a little more well rounded.  Bass would be fine, but it seems like a waste of minutes since I don't think he gets us into the playoffs.   Jameer is always welcome."
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,IOnlyCareAboutIrony,4,Thu Jul 2 17:46:42 2015 UTC,"The only FA's I was really interested in were Millsap as a starter and Wright as a backup, both those guys are gone, so a backup PG is all we need. Bring back Jameer?"
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,Ellimistopher,4,Thu Jul 2 16:35:53 2015 UTC,White Chocolate is back in town for a charity game.
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,MelbourneFL321,3,Thu Jul 2 19:31:50 2015 UTC,Swing and a miss this year. Maybe get a backup PG but I say keep the players we have maybe do something by this years trade deadline.
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,alan4884,3,Thu Jul 2 15:34:32 2015 UTC,Jamal Crawford
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,orlrdvxl,3,Thu Jul 2 15:46:26 2015 UTC,Kendall Marshall.
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,ninety4kid,2,Thu Jul 2 17:56:30 2015 UTC,I think we are better off just sticking with what we have and trying to develop them.   I don't see a need to bring Jameer back.   Just keep developing what we have.  Skiles played the PG position so I'm sure he can help Elfrid come along just fine.  Sometimes it's better to stand pat.  If the Magic look really good then maybe some other free agents can be enticed to come over at the trade deadline later in the season.
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,maddog00,2,Thu Jul 2 20:26:02 2015 UTC,We need a backup for Elf though. I love him death but I don't think he can play 48 minutes. Fournier is a rough choice for backup PG.
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,maddog00,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:56:51 2015 UTC,"I think we can still pick up a backup PG.  Plus Oladipo can play some PG also as he did during his rookie season.     I just don't think we should freak out over not landing a big name.   There really weren't that many available TO US right now.  The Magic need to play some serious basketball and maybe by the trade deadline we can still make a deal with a team that isn't going to make the playoffs.  It's better to be patient rather than make a bad deal right now.  Let's see what we have with our new coach first.     As for Tobias, I like him but I don't want to see us overpay for him.  He's not really worth a max."
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,orlrdvxl,4,Thu Jul 2 21:57:33 2015 UTC,Austin Rivers?
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,MagicN3rd,3,Thu Jul 2 15:34:24 2015 UTC,I actually like this idea. Another scorer off the bench and also a local kid.
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,Ellimistopher,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:01:28 2015 UTC,"We had one shot, it was Millsap, and we missed.  Free agency is over for the Magic."
OrlandoMagic,3bvlqa,orlrdvxl,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:22:48 2015 UTC,You really don't think we'll grab a backup point guard?
OrlandoMagic,3bxa8c,miracleon55,6,Thu Jul 2 22:29:54 2015 UTC,"Hezonja is going to fit perfectly, regardless if Harris is re-signed or not(which I fully expect Orlando to do now that they missed on Millsap).   I'm super excited to see what Hezonja can do now that he's in an NBA system which emphasizes spacing and how he's going to thrive. Imagine a lineup of Payton/Oladipo/Hezonja or Harris/Gordon/Vucevic. You're able to switch 1-4, all four players can initiate the offense or fast break, and all can break-down a defense in a late clock situation. Not to mention, our big fella is quietly becoming one of the most consistent and revered offensive bigs in the entire NBA.   I'm pretty pumped-up for this season to see how we fair."
OrlandoMagic,3bxa8c,bigduck24,2,Fri Jul 3 06:23:20 2015 UTC,"Are we sure Gordon can consistently create his own shot? Or even Hezonja for that matter? I am sure he will get to that point, but it will take him awhile to get a feel for the NBA. I see Mario's 3 point abilities being able to contribute to more looks for AG because of the floor spacing, but other than that I feel like we are being to optimistic about AG and Mario's PER potential."
OrlandoMagic,3bxa8c,Swalrus,2,Fri Jul 3 07:55:51 2015 UTC,I'm so ready for the Harris issue to be dealt with. I am fully expecting Orlando to max him out but many articles like this one appear to not agree. I am surprised Boston hasn't made their move for him yet.
OrlandoMagic,3bxa8c,Swalrus,2,Fri Jul 3 05:56:42 2015 UTC,"It would tie up money when the potential for signing other free agents is out there. Unless Orlando moves first, I wouldn't be surprised to see them wait a few days until the major FAs are off the market."
OrlandoMagic,3bvw29,alan4884,4,Thu Jul 2 16:07:10 2015 UTC,Something to be excited about!
OrlandoMagic,3bvw29,SamuelMuniz,6,Thu Jul 2 16:08:45 2015 UTC,yea man I'm tired of being down on the team. I'm really excited about both our draft pics. Ready for summer league
OrlandoMagic,3bvw29,IteLacerti,3,Thu Jul 2 16:48:51 2015 UTC,"Damn, Hezonja busted out the Spanish without missing a beat."
OrlandoMagic,3bvw29,maddog00,2,Fri Jul 3 15:51:57 2015 UTC,Hardly anyone is smiling.  Skiles looks like Vic Mackey from The Shield.  :)
OrlandoMagic,3bt8gg,rippleffect81,13,Wed Jul 1 23:21:53 2015 UTC,LET'S UNLEASH SUPER MARIO ON THOSE SUCKAS!!! BANG BANG!!!
OrlandoMagic,3bt8gg,alan4884,5,Wed Jul 1 23:59:08 2015 UTC,I really want MARIO to dunk on Milsap.
OrlandoMagic,3bt8gg,houseQM,12,Thu Jul 2 15:10:19 2015 UTC,Tobias buzzer beater vs atlanta--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2y-ijUXs-I
OrlandoMagic,3bt8gg,yo_viola,9,Thu Jul 2 00:26:37 2015 UTC,OH THAT WOULD FEEL SO GOOD IF WE CAN JUST REKT ATLANTA THIS YEAR.
OrlandoMagic,3bt8gg,mjridiculouz,8,Wed Jul 1 23:35:28 2015 UTC,Chooo chooooo!
OrlandoMagic,3bt8gg,Bks1358,6,Wed Jul 1 23:25:04 2015 UTC,ALLLL ABOAAAARRRRDD
OrlandoMagic,3bt8gg,muHb,13,Thu Jul 2 00:10:34 2015 UTC,The possibility that he used the Magic for leverage to get a better deal from Atlanta is leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.
OrlandoMagic,3bt8gg,onlysame1,5,Wed Jul 1 23:55:13 2015 UTC,Well now they have less cap room due to us so its not a total loss
OrlandoMagic,3bt8gg,Scottydoesntknowyou,3,Thu Jul 2 03:30:45 2015 UTC,"We play them well anyway, and this roster matches up well. I don't think ATL overachieves like they did and the Southeast is a bit closer this season. I can see a 2nd, 3rd or 4th place finish."
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,ciths,12,Wed Jul 1 22:37:37 2015 UTC,That was fun to think about. Was surprised by it. Wonder if we have anything else up our sleeve.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,ajax0626,3,Wed Jul 1 22:41:42 2015 UTC,I can't imagine what. Most big free agents have already signed somewhere.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,whtge8,5,Wed Jul 1 22:44:52 2015 UTC,Draymond Green and Warriors are having trouble agreeing to terms. Let's continue to dream?
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,ajax0626,5,Wed Jul 1 22:48:56 2015 UTC,That's even less realistic than Millsap was. So mad right now.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,whtge8,23,Wed Jul 1 22:51:51 2015 UTC,Fucking blue-balled. I'm sad.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,chriszzz,11,Wed Jul 1 22:41:12 2015 UTC,Fuck. Me
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,onlysame1,10,Wed Jul 1 22:37:50 2015 UTC,"You know what, at least we were in the conversation for a pretty fucking good player. That's exciting to me, even if we didn't get him in the end."
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,Ispentthatbread,6,Wed Jul 1 23:13:54 2015 UTC,Yea that was a no lose situation. We either sign a star or do what we were doing anyways. That attention is good and there's ganna be a time when it works. I like the kind of guy we went for there. Still think we need to lock up Tobes. Summer league and July 4th is almost here. Its time to celebrate a little.    Cheers to Mario and America! (or maybe the other way around)
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,alan4884,8,Wed Jul 1 23:55:56 2015 UTC,Dang.

OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,bigduck24,5,Wed Jul 1 22:44:17 2015 UTC,"He used us. Ugh whatever we still have a good core, I like the attitude though"
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,Orlandipo3,5,Wed Jul 1 22:54:58 2015 UTC,"He used us... Toyed with our hearts.. He'll pay for this!! We're gonna knock the Hawks out of the playoffs, you heard it here first"
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,BrotherBroseph,4,Wed Jul 1 23:06:07 2015 UTC,This is why we can't get excited for things! Damn you Milsap!
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,albinorhino21,7,Wed Jul 1 22:43:39 2015 UTC,My hopes were lifted and crushed
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,JDC4654,4,Wed Jul 1 22:41:19 2015 UTC,Can Confirm.  Source: am lifetime magic fan
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,rippleffect81,3,Wed Jul 1 23:16:39 2015 UTC,haahaha. For sure. The basketball gods had to do something to knock us back down though being that we're on a cloud on the basis that Mario's not going to pull a Fran Vasquez.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,FlipFlopCleats,6,Wed Jul 1 23:35:07 2015 UTC,Son of a bitch. A lineup of Payton/Dipo/Mario/Trillsap/Vucci would've been great.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,waffel113,3,Wed Jul 1 22:42:39 2015 UTC,"Also it would have gave us some really fun small ball lineups. And I loved the idea of giving dipo sometime at pg with Mario and harris on the wings, PM at the 4 and Vuc at the 5."
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,Swalrus,6,Wed Jul 1 23:08:48 2015 UTC,So what the hell do we do now? Who are we going to sign?
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,xiedian,5,Wed Jul 1 22:47:32 2015 UTC,"Draymond Green, Greg Monroe, Robin Lopez, Kosta Koufos, Ed Davis.   Oh. That's just big men. People need to calm down. I didn't expect us to sign anybody. Turns out we made a play to sign a big one and missed, now we're panicking?"
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,ajax0626,4,Wed Jul 1 23:21:22 2015 UTC,We were all just really excited that someone like him would want to come here. We have a glaring need at PF and I can't think of a way to address it.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,whtge8,3,Wed Jul 1 23:26:14 2015 UTC,"Thats true. But I think it's mostly disappointment, not panic. Either way, I think we'll still make a leap into the playoffs next year"
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,xiedian,5,Wed Jul 1 23:25:45 2015 UTC,Nobody. There's no one left.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,whtge8,5,Wed Jul 1 22:52:21 2015 UTC,"Thats what I'm saying.. :(  It was fun to watch a big name like that get into deep talks with us, but you can't help but feel a little disappointed that a contributor of his caliber couldn't reach a deal with us"
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,xiedian,5,Wed Jul 1 22:54:14 2015 UTC,Tobais will be back
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,Swalrus,4,Wed Jul 1 22:52:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that does not solve our front court defensive issues. Harris can't guard most power forwards in the league. PM and Harris are not comparable players. What we get now is lots of Ded and KOQ."
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,whtge8,3,Wed Jul 1 23:06:27 2015 UTC,Maybe try to trade for Gibson or something...? I don't know. -_-
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,tropicalrecon,3,Wed Jul 1 23:24:48 2015 UTC,That's why we drafted Gordon.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,goat_justinanderson,-5,Thu Jul 2 05:18:52 2015 UTC,Let Harris go and let hezonja develop
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,whtge8,5,Wed Jul 1 23:07:36 2015 UTC,Why would we do that? Let's first see how Hezonja is. If he ends up being a star then we can always trade Harris.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,goat_justinanderson,-7,Wed Jul 1 23:25:18 2015 UTC,"He's going to get the max most likely, how do you trade that? And I think it's equivalent to keeping a decent player over a guy like Anthony Davis his rookie year because you don't know how he will do. This kid is absurdly talented there's no way he ends up worse than Harris unless his development is hurt by a lack of playing time"
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,jive_turkey,3,Wed Jul 1 23:31:05 2015 UTC,Do you see how many dudes are getting paid right now? Tobias's max is $15M... That's nothing considering al farouq aminu just got like $9m/year.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,whtge8,2,Wed Jul 1 23:37:10 2015 UTC,His contract will be nothing in a few years. Plus you have no idea how Hezonja will be. He could just as easily be a bust. There's no reason to let Harris walk.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,goat_justinanderson,-5,Wed Jul 1 23:42:33 2015 UTC,How can you say it's just as easy to say he's a bust? Because he played overseas? Would you say the same about towns or Russell? If not then that's unfair. He may be the most talented player in the draft. This isn't some typical overseas project pick. This kid is a top 2-3 pick if he plays in the U.S.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,whtge8,5,Wed Jul 1 23:49:15 2015 UTC,Of course I would. Draft picks are huge unknowns. Nobody knows how they will turn out to be. Russell or Okafor could definitely be busts. Why not at least wait and see what we have?
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,goat_justinanderson,-3,Wed Jul 1 23:51:10 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. As long as you are not a hypocrite, then bring unsure with how a prospect will do is reasonable. I just think that the only way to truly see what we have is by playing him at least 30+ minutes"
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,whtge8,3,Wed Jul 1 23:53:55 2015 UTC,I don't see any benefit in giving a 20 year old rookie that has never played against NBA level or even NCAA competition 30+ minutes a game. If he adapts and plays well then sure. He could play the 2 or the 3. We can try Payton/Oladipo/Hezona/Harris/Vucevic or even Oladipo/Hezonja/Gordon/Harris/Vucevic. He will see plenty of time. And if he ends up being a star then we can always trade Harris. 15 million a year is nothing if he continues to improve.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,goat_justinanderson,-2,Wed Jul 1 23:56:21 2015 UTC,"Euroleague competition is just as good if not better. Who deserves hezonjas minutes? Frye, harkless? There is a potential superstar he needs the chance to play big minutes, what is there to lose?"
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,jdub1418,3,Thu Jul 2 00:03:54 2015 UTC,"Disappointing, but good for him. Hes 30 now, may as well try to get a ring."
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,whtge8,6,Thu Jul 2 00:46:43 2015 UTC,Still no PF. What are we going to do now?
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,Ellimistopher,5,Wed Jul 1 22:40:59 2015 UTC,Play Harris/Frye/Gordon at PF
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,Swalrus,2,Wed Jul 1 23:00:15 2015 UTC,Aka get roasted in the low post.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,Ellimistopher,3,Wed Jul 1 23:06:59 2015 UTC,"Sounds fun, BBQ party in the paint"
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,Swalrus,0,Wed Jul 1 23:10:35 2015 UTC,All day until the lottery.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,whtge8,2,Wed Jul 1 23:12:47 2015 UTC,Free can't guard anyone and Harris/Gordon are too small for the 4.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,Swalrus,3,Wed Jul 1 23:02:11 2015 UTC,Harris is bigger than draymon green its lack of ability and will not size.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,whtge8,2,Wed Jul 1 23:13:51 2015 UTC,Doesn't Green have like a 7'+wingspan?
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,Swalrus,2,Wed Jul 1 23:15:20 2015 UTC,And Harris is listed at 6 11 wingspan.  But I agree he is not suited to PF.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,dev1359,3,Wed Jul 1 23:19:05 2015 UTC,"I mean Millsap is pretty undersized too, isn't he only 6'8""?"
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,Ellimistopher,5,Wed Jul 1 23:50:58 2015 UTC,Lottery Party 2016!
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,subutaime,6,Wed Jul 1 23:04:49 2015 UTC,"We dodged a bullet, that contract was insane. I like Millsap but come on."
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,Deadcellz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:14:34 2015 UTC,"I agree it was an overpay, he would have been great on even the contract he got from atlanta not for 4years 80m"
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,tropicalrecon,0,Thu Jul 2 14:52:24 2015 UTC,Your the only person I have found with the same opinion.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,tropicalrecon,2,Thu Jul 2 05:27:00 2015 UTC,"I prayed to the basketball gods and asked for Millsap to resign with atl, they answered me!"
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,onlysame1,4,Thu Jul 2 05:14:01 2015 UTC,His loss considering that Carroll left to the Raptors lol. Now they are worse than they were when they got swept by the Cavs. Good luck getting passed them now.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,impactplayer,2,Wed Jul 1 22:58:20 2015 UTC,"I honestly think we dodged a bullet here.  I didn't want to sign an aging player to a max.  Edit - Well, fuck me for not wanting to sign an undersized 30-year old PF to a 4 year max."
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,tropicalrecon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:46:14 2015 UTC,Exactly
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,ajax0626,0,Thu Jul 2 05:27:58 2015 UTC,It's a 3 year deal lol
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,maddog00,4,Wed Jul 1 22:49:41 2015 UTC,"I read that it was a 4 year deal.  I agree with impactplayer.  I wasn't that crazy about another undersized PF on the roster.  The guy is only 6'8"" and his numbers looked about like Tobias numbers.   it didn't make a ton of sense other than he was a vet."
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,matty_hawk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:59:56 2015 UTC,Would you take Draymond Green if given the chance?
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,ajax0626,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:13:00 2015 UTC,Fuck yes without hesitation.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,impactplayer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:28:59 2015 UTC,I don't think Draymond is worth a max either but I'd rather them sign him to a max than Millsap.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,ajax0626,0,Thu Jul 2 00:15:42 2015 UTC,The 4th year is a player option. He'll likely opt out since the cap will be much larger then and contracts will be even bigger.   Edit: actually a 3 year deal with the 3rd year being a player option.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,impactplayer,0,Wed Jul 1 23:04:31 2015 UTC,He wouldn't opt out because he would be at the tail end of his career.  He wouldn't be demanding max-caliber money (~$20 mil)  on the market at 34 years old.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,ajax0626,0,Wed Jul 1 23:10:35 2015 UTC,"It's actually a two year deal with a player option on the 3rd year. He's opting out, but go ahead and believe what you want lol."
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,Swalrus,2,Wed Jul 1 23:28:35 2015 UTC,I am sure we lock up Harris and possibly try and shop him as a sign and trade for a low post partner for Vuc. Is there anyone who has a surplus at PF who needs a SF.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,goat_justinanderson,4,Wed Jul 1 23:03:35 2015 UTC,Chicago. Gibson
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,Swalrus,2,Wed Jul 1 23:07:11 2015 UTC,"the best Power Fowards on the market are Greg Monroe, David West or Ed Davis."
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,CoreyMaim,2,Wed Jul 1 23:10:15 2015 UTC,and I guess if we can't get someone who advances us to legitimate playoff contenders its best just to grow organically and take another swing at the lottery next year.   But who knows. I didn't expect us to offer a max deal to any PF this offseason maybe Henni has some s/t magic up his sleeve.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,Lauxman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:16:18 2015 UTC,"Horford, Millsap and Splitter. Unless they trade one of them, it makes no sense."

OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,ultranonymous11,-6,Thu Jul 2 04:07:44 2015 UTC,DONT KEEP HARRIS. He will slow hezonjas development
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,goat_justinanderson,4,Wed Jul 1 23:07:57 2015 UTC,I'm weirdly glad our sub is big enough now to have trolls of our own. Feels like we're moving on up!
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,tropicalrecon,-1,Thu Jul 2 01:48:51 2015 UTC,I'm not trolling dumbass. I think he will be a great player and needs a starting role next year to help his development. Fucking Retard
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,Gucciforlife,2,Thu Jul 2 02:02:24 2015 UTC,"Damn, I hope Hezonja outplays Harris so he gets traded for good backup role players."
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,goat_justinanderson,4,Thu Jul 2 05:32:17 2015 UTC,Dumb
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,REEB,-6,Wed Jul 1 23:10:29 2015 UTC,How? Harris will take his starting spot I assume
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,goat_justinanderson,5,Wed Jul 1 23:13:59 2015 UTC,He's a rook who played limited minutes for his former team... he can come off the bench until he adjusts/develops into a reliable starter.
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,REEB,-6,Wed Jul 1 23:18:51 2015 UTC,"He played limited minutes because his coach was unhappy with his NBA decision. When he played big minutes he was great. He's by far more talented than any other sf on the roster. What's the point of having him come off the bench? So eventually let's say he takes Harris spot as a starter, you're going to pay him to come off the bench? What the hell do the magic have to lose? You don't draft a player that talented to have him come along slowly, especially when you are a lottery team. The only way he develops is if he gets to play a lot. This is the number one way guys end up underachieving, they go to situations where they can't develop. It would be beyond moronic to bring him off the bench"
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,goat_justinanderson,5,Wed Jul 1 23:23:52 2015 UTC,"When the cap goes up, his contract won't be an issue. We can trade him or bring him off the bench as a sixth man. You need depth to compete in this league."
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,REEB,0,Wed Jul 1 23:30:53 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I just really don't want to see hezonja lack minutes next year. This kid can be ROY right away he needs the chance
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,goat_justinanderson,2,Wed Jul 1 23:33:23 2015 UTC,"Hezonja will get plenty of minutes off the bench since he can play both SG and SF. Harris will also play some PF next season. Coming off the bench will be good for Hezonja. Doesn't matter how much you believe in him, he will likely need time to adjust to more minutes and the NBA. Some of the greatest players in history struggled their rookie year."
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,ciggy622,0,Wed Jul 1 23:41:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he won't struggle. Just that he's good enough to get it in a few months rather than a many years long project. I don't think coming off the bench when you have immediate impact potential, especially when you are not a playoff team with nothing to lose, is ever a good idea"
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,REEB,-9,Wed Jul 1 23:46:59 2015 UTC,Another big name that Hennigan failed to get in FA... This is becoming continually bothersome...
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,Scottydoesntknowyou,4,Wed Jul 1 22:59:40 2015 UTC,Do you see any other small market lottery teams signing all stars?
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,ciggy622,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:27:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly, who the hell wants to go to a 25 win small market team that's 2 years away from POSSIBLY being good.  Top FA want to go to condenders or big markets.   2nd tier FA may want to come here tho"
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,REEB,-1,Wed Jul 1 23:50:19 2015 UTC,"We had a decent team with a lottery pick level coach that was Vaughn. We have the preices set in place to make a run. We aren't in a shitty enough position that a lottery team usually is in. We should have enough to draw a name to the team, Millsap isn't exactly a huge talent to the point that he can't be signed. Hennigan is great in the draft, but seems to be pretty incompetent in the offseason and signing anyone worth signing."
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,ciggy622,5,Wed Jul 1 23:38:24 2015 UTC,If you're surprised a 30 year old all star decided to stick with his 60 win team instead of coming to a 25 win team then I don't know what to tell you...
OrlandoMagic,3bt2v0,WadeOverLeBron,0,Wed Jul 1 23:44:32 2015 UTC,And that 30 year old took less money betting on himself for the next 3 years to go back to Atlanta who just lost a decent peice of the puzzle to Toronto. That doesn't seem like it would have been asking a lot to convince him to come here
OrlandoMagic,3bt57b,mjridiculouz,26,Wed Jul 1 22:55:18 2015 UTC,Well this is the most depressing post of the year

OrlandoMagic,3bt57b,estuhbawn,4,Thu Jul 2 00:05:45 2015 UTC,I actually think that Frye will be alot better this season under a normal coach. Don't you? Frye hasn't been that bad in his career and I am quite sure that he will bounce back.
OrlandoMagic,3bt57b,HKHansson,3,Thu Jul 2 09:14:06 2015 UTC,Us. We are the people who need Paul Millsap when we have that bust.

OrlandoMagic,3bt57b,UpvotesArePeople,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:35:29 2015 UTC,If there is a positive in not signing millsap to a 4 year max it is that Aaron gordon will have a lot more room to grow and minutes to play. p.s still hate Channing Frye
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,rtillaree,27,Wed Jul 1 13:42:57 2015 UTC,IM FLIPPING OUT RIGHT NOW. The fact that we are actually in a race with getting a very very very good player (arguably all-star level) is just amazing.
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,mjridiculouz,11,Wed Jul 1 13:44:32 2015 UTC,He's been an all-star the last 2 years in a row!! Lets goooo
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,greenskeeper87,11,Wed Jul 1 14:41:04 2015 UTC,"This would be great. I still don't see Millsap leaving Atlanta, but it could just be because we've been down so much lately it's hard to get excited about a possible acquisition.  I think I'm also still a little hurt about Tim Duncan leading us on a million years ago only to re-sign with San Antonio."
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,SamuelMuniz,6,Wed Jul 1 13:52:05 2015 UTC,What's worse our consolation prize was 8 years of Grant Hill's Ankle. Ugh.
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,hansn484,8,Wed Jul 1 14:06:13 2015 UTC,"see? So many people are all ""we're back in the lotto next year"" ""what is Hennigan doing?"" ""we can't get FA's"" - at the very least, we're trying!"
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,whtge8,6,Wed Jul 1 13:46:59 2015 UTC,I think a lot of people said that because it seemed like we weren't going to do anything during the summer again.
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,onlysame1,2,Wed Jul 1 14:25:09 2015 UTC,"going to show, people have no idea what a team is inclined to do. makes it fun......sometimes."
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,REEB,2,Wed Jul 1 14:27:48 2015 UTC,Hennigan is notorious for keeping everything close to his vest. rarely will you hear anything leaked from the Magic Front Office.
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,jarethcutestory,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:51:43 2015 UTC,Amazing the meeting was at 12:01am and we didn't hear about until close to 10am. Usually that stuff leaks ahead of the meeting.
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,Gucciforlife,5,Wed Jul 1 15:53:13 2015 UTC,"If it comes down to $, we have an edge with no state income tax. If he's all about contending, ATL has the edge. We're still a winning team IMO with him coming to ORL though."
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,ajax0626,5,Wed Jul 1 14:21:38 2015 UTC,"This is excellent news for two huge reasons:  Reason 1- if the magic sign him they will be very competitive and will have a good chance making the playoffs this upcoming year  Reason 2- the only way the magic do not sign him is if rival Atlanta Hawks match the magic on a max 5 year deal, which combined w their other large salaries will undoubtedly restrict what they can do in FA for the near future.  So Imo if we don't get him it will still be great the magic tried and give him this offer"
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,bizort,7,Wed Jul 1 14:36:05 2015 UTC,Yes either we get a really good player or Atl is likely forced to make their overall roster weaker. Pretty savvy move.
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,SamuelMuniz,3,Wed Jul 1 14:46:28 2015 UTC,"I thought Atlanta didn't have full Bird rights so they couldn't give him a 5 year deal. Basically Orlando and Atlanta stand on the same ground in these negotiations, I believe"
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,Greeno789,2,Wed Jul 1 15:09:10 2015 UTC,"Millsap may not be the sexiest prize this OS but he's a great consolation prize to round out a SOLID starting 5. He brings experience and capable abilities to the club. He's a pretty tough player and knows his role. He's a rich man's Brandon Bass. I was all about Millsap earlier in the year and I understand the flack for the suggestion but, sometimes (Rashard Lewis) you just have to pick that guy up and pay a lot for him if you feel like it'll put you over."
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,mjridiculouz,3,Wed Jul 1 14:23:48 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, Millsap may think the Hawks have peaked. I mean, they totally overachieved last year. He may think Orlando may not be in the Hawks' league this season, but in three years it may be the other way around."

OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,rsdio,4,Wed Jul 1 15:19:18 2015 UTC,SOMEBODY HOLD ME!   Nick Gryniewicz ESPN ‏@ESPN580Nick #BHSN's @DespinaBarton reports that Paul Millsap is in Orlando meeting with #Magic. Tells me he is very serious about coming to ORL.
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,Orlandipo3,3,Wed Jul 1 18:51:08 2015 UTC,No way! This would be amazing.
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,jive_turkey,3,Wed Jul 1 13:45:45 2015 UTC,"How does he mesh with what we currently have and need? 3 point shooting big to space the floor? He's not much of a defensive presence, is he?"
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,WadeOverLeBron,6,Wed Jul 1 13:56:54 2015 UTC,"He averages over 1 blk and 1 stl a game over his whole career. He is very consistent and he is an all star. we wont get 100% of everything we need, but this would be huge for the team. This would put us back on the map."
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,msimeone,6,Wed Jul 1 14:48:12 2015 UTC,He's an excellent defender.
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,Bks1358,7,Wed Jul 1 14:28:35 2015 UTC,Probably one of the best two way 4s in the game
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,Bks1358,2,Wed Jul 1 16:29:37 2015 UTC,The only time he ever gets mentioned defensively in a national perspective is when he has to guard LeBron James... That doesn't end well for just about anyone.
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,EyeoftheTyga,2,Wed Jul 1 15:17:49 2015 UTC,Great defender but was hobbled during the playoffs with his shoulder injury so you could tell he was hobbled a bit and couldn't play up to his potential.
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,LowkeyAnushole,3,Wed Jul 1 14:46:35 2015 UTC,"It's a lot of $, but adding an All-Star caliber player to this young core will only make them better. Elfrid, Oladipo, Fournier, Hezonja, Harris, Gordon, and Vucevic are all under 25. They are all key to our future. If they can get playoff experience this early in their careers, it will only lead to great things."
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,LowkeyAnushole,3,Wed Jul 1 14:32:41 2015 UTC,Hawks just traded for Splitter! Maybe...
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,LowkeyAnushole,5,Wed Jul 1 16:03:45 2015 UTC,I actually see this as more of an issue for our chances. They're probably going to include enough contracts to free up space and let Carroll walk over Millsap. Thabo will be back and they'll be able to pickup a rotational guy anywhere.
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,whtge8,2,Wed Jul 1 16:06:26 2015 UTC,Maybe sign and trade Tobias to the Hawks?
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,Stark52,3,Wed Jul 1 16:23:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think it makes sense for them but, maybe if they want him. DeMarre Carroll just agreed to a 4/$60m with the Raps and there is NO way the Hawks match that, it doesn't make long-term sense for them, IMO.  *EDIT: To clarify, financial sense. They need a 3, I guess and Thabo will be out a few months still, I think."
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,__theo,3,Wed Jul 1 16:26:24 2015 UTC,"Holy shit. This is what it feels like.. It's been so long since we've even had a big player interested in us. I don't want to get my hopes up, but if we keep Harris, sign Millsap, get Jameer for the vet min, and have fucking Hezonja, Gordon, and Fournier as bench wings. HOLY FUCKING SHIT"
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,Lauxman,3,Wed Jul 1 16:26:47 2015 UTC,"Michael Scotto @MikeAScotto Paul Millsap is leaning towards signing with the Atlanta Hawks, a league source tells Sheridan Hoops.   just rumors but :("
OrlandoMagic,3br2qc,ciths,4,Wed Jul 1 17:59:17 2015 UTC,Chris Broussard (sauces) says the Hawks have matched the max offer to Millsap and now...we wait.
OrlandoMagic,3buows,ynksjts,4,Thu Jul 2 08:23:50 2015 UTC,"He's good, which is why we're matching any offer."
OrlandoMagic,3buows,REEB,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:41:02 2015 UTC,He's good but not great.  He seems too small for PF and too slow for SF.   I don't think he is a max salary type player right now.  Maybe if he develops some more he will grow into that.
OrlandoMagic,3buows,maddog00,0,Thu Jul 2 22:08:58 2015 UTC,He's a cunt.
OrlandoMagic,3bt3gt,ciths,4,Wed Jul 1 22:42:16 2015 UTC,We need defense
OrlandoMagic,3bt3gt,EyeoftheTyga,3,Wed Jul 1 22:47:54 2015 UTC,"Nah, I don't think they even touch him"
OrlandoMagic,3bt3gt,xiedian,3,Wed Jul 1 22:46:45 2015 UTC,Last year it was rumored that Rob Hennigan really liked him.
OrlandoMagic,3bt3gt,kreynolds26,3,Wed Jul 1 22:47:06 2015 UTC,"No way. He's an older, not as good and smaller Nik Vucevic."
OrlandoMagic,3bt3gt,ItoldonAnneFrank,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:52:59 2015 UTC,"Well actually he was born in the same year as Vucevic, but everything else you said is dead on. He'd be an awful pairing with Vuc. Too many overlapping skills. I think whoever pays Monroe is going to regret it."
OrlandoMagic,3bt3gt,OllieWillie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:21:23 2015 UTC,"Vooch is October 1990 and Monroe is June, so he's right. You now agree with him entirely."
OrlandoMagic,3bt3gt,REEB,3,Thu Jul 2 13:13:24 2015 UTC,I think he wants to play center. Don't think he'd be a good fit with Vuc either.
OrlandoMagic,3bt3gt,rtillaree,2,Thu Jul 2 00:29:43 2015 UTC,I'd almost wonder if we go David West now given the landscape and the type of player we had in Millsap.   Of course at 34 he may be win now and we're not there.

OrlandoMagic,3brl90,UpvotesArePeople,4,Wed Jul 1 16:10:13 2015 UTC,I think he's gone. Carroll is gone now too. I highly doubt Millsap can play SF next to Horford and Splitter. He can start from day one here and be a main part of our offense.
OrlandoMagic,3brl90,whtge8,5,Wed Jul 1 16:15:20 2015 UTC,"I dunno, Splitter, Millsap and Horford as a 3 man rotation makes sense to me, albeit maybe a bit too much money.   (edit: Sorry guys, I ruined it for us.)"
OrlandoMagic,3brl90,Spanky_The_Explorer,2,Wed Jul 1 16:22:09 2015 UTC,I don't think Millsap is quick enough to play the 3. I also don't think he is going to want to come off the bench.
OrlandoMagic,3brl90,whtge8,2,Wed Jul 1 16:22:55 2015 UTC,Splitter would be off the bench in that scenario.
OrlandoMagic,3brl90,Spanky_The_Explorer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:23:41 2015 UTC,"And Horford at C? That doesn't make sense. His natural position is PF, they just never really had a good center. Starting Horford and Splitter would be the best option IMO. They just need to find a new SF."
OrlandoMagic,3brl90,whtge8,4,Wed Jul 1 16:25:01 2015 UTC,"I don't want to read too much into it, but this can only be a positive sign for our chances at Millsap."
OrlandoMagic,3brl90,deafcon,2,Wed Jul 1 16:11:03 2015 UTC,Everybody keep your damn fingers crossed.
OrlandoMagic,3br40x,kevinnewman4life,9,Wed Jul 1 13:55:17 2015 UTC,This is a brilliant move for Henni. No one considered this possibility but the Hawks cant keep all their stars can they? We would absolutely sign him for depth and to start. Jazz reportedly want him back too? The Magic would be an interesting choice for Millsap.
OrlandoMagic,3br40x,orlrdvxl,5,Wed Jul 1 14:38:39 2015 UTC,It would be a great fit
OrlandoMagic,3br40x,onlysame1,6,Wed Jul 1 14:46:09 2015 UTC,For clarity - Atlanta has offered Millsap the exact same deal. Millsap is deciding between the two and a decision could come as early as today. He will not entertain any other meetings despite substantial interest.
OrlandoMagic,3br40x,whtge8,3,Wed Jul 1 14:19:53 2015 UTC,Really? Atlanta offered him all that money too? Where did you see that?

OrlandoMagic,3br40x,whtge8,5,Wed Jul 1 14:26:40 2015 UTC,Damn. I don't see why he would pick us over Atlanta then if the money is the same.

OrlandoMagic,3br40x,elfreedpayton,-4,Wed Jul 1 14:56:18 2015 UTC,Rashard Lewis Lite
OrlandoMagic,3br40x,tropicalrecon,2,Wed Jul 1 14:02:38 2015 UTC,he's way better than Lewis in every way except 3pt shooting and thats about it.

OrlandoMagic,3br40x,tropicalrecon,0,Wed Jul 1 16:14:49 2015 UTC,"No he isn't, Lewis was a sniper averaging the same amount of rebounds. They're both equal in value and neither deserves this money."
OrlandoMagic,3br40x,dev1359,2,Wed Jul 1 15:44:53 2015 UTC,"Millsap is a far superior passer, defender, and rebounder than Lewis. Millsap has always played next to great rebounders (Horford, Big Al) that gobble rebounds, yet his career rebound avg is higher than Lewis'"
OrlandoMagic,3br40x,Orlandipo3,-1,Wed Jul 1 16:44:01 2015 UTC,This guy is worth 60 million for 4 years. They're committing the rashard Lewis mistake again.
OrlandoMagic,3br40x,houseQM,3,Wed Jul 1 15:41:31 2015 UTC,If the cap is going to be at $108 mil two years from now then I'm not really too worried about paying this guy $20 mil a year.

OrlandoMagic,3br40x,houseQM,3,Wed Jul 1 14:14:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If we get Milsap, we get reliability in terms of scoring at he four and another good rebounder as well. Vuc and Milsap are a good duo with range that can provide an open lane for Vic, Elf and MARIO.

OrlandoMagic,3br40x,ciths,2,Wed Jul 1 14:57:26 2015 UTC,There is no reason not to sign harris. Harris can play the 3 and the 4. This will give us awesome depth. If anything it might signal the end for Harkless and Nicholson.

OrlandoMagic,3bst29,REEB,6,Wed Jul 1 21:24:27 2015 UTC,Payton - Oladipo - Harris - Millsap - Vucevic. Sounds solid to me.

OrlandoMagic,3bst29,Orlandipo3,4,Wed Jul 1 21:27:48 2015 UTC,Huge lol
OrlandoMagic,3bst29,Orlandipo3,3,Wed Jul 1 21:24:57 2015 UTC,I know he's at least somewhat of an upgrade.  T12 is pretty good though.
OrlandoMagic,3bst29,onlysame1,3,Wed Jul 1 21:28:49 2015 UTC,Millsap is an elite defensive player who can guard the 3/4/5 positions. He's also a better offense player than Tobias right now. Hopefully we can sign both though
OrlandoMagic,3bu2jq,Deadbeatatdawn,11,Thu Jul 2 03:55:34 2015 UTC,"Lots of things to look forward to this year!   -Oladipo should make his ""third year leap"" if you believe in that sort of thing.  -Elfrid is actually working with a shooting coach this year, which he didn't do last year if I recall correctly. Imagine not being able to go under screens on this guy. Lethal.  -We have an actual coach! No more rotations that seem designed to lose us games (I hope)  -A healthy Aaron Gordon could be a big piece this year. I was at a few games last year and there were flashes where he would just outrun everybody on the break and then bully people down low. Would love to see him come back with a full season under his belt and settle into a rhythm.   -Playoffs aren't out of reach this year. If we don't make a serious push, questions have to start being asked.   Bottom line, we have an exciting young team with a defensive minded coach that seems to like high paced offenses. I believe that we are going to run and gun next year. More running than gunning. Hopefully finish out at a 6 seed. An NBA fan loves nothing more than an exciting 5-8 seed. Good times are ahead. I hope."
OrlandoMagic,3bu2jq,farcicalbison,3,Thu Jul 2 04:15:33 2015 UTC,"Great points! I'm a little disappointed by the lack of progress this past year, but you're right -- a decent coach should make a huge difference."
OrlandoMagic,3bu2jq,Shermanpk,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:26:23 2015 UTC,"Don't forget AG's shooting technique looked good, and was able to put in the open ones, put it on the floor and make the lay-up. And his defence was at least as expected."
OrlandoMagic,3bu2jq,svanxx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:16:09 2015 UTC,Oladipo will be at the age that Wade was when he made his incredible leap.
OrlandoMagic,3bu2jq,alan4884,4,Thu Jul 2 16:27:47 2015 UTC,All I have to say is Super Mario and Summer League
OrlandoMagic,3bu2jq,EyeoftheTyga,2,Thu Jul 2 10:43:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't expect anything in FA, so for me we are still a playoff team"
OrlandoMagic,3bu2jq,jarkarawr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:17:53 2015 UTC,The plan is to build through the draft like it has been. Our young guys are growing. If there's a free agent we like that fits with the team then we'll try to sign them like we did with Milsap. He didn't end up signing with us but it's not the end of the world. No point in going out and signing players just for the sake of signing players if they aren't what we need. I was surprised we went after someone like Milsap cause he's a pretty big name. I really didn't think we'd try to sign anyone this summer we'd wait till next season. This upcoming season we have an actual coach so we should be able to get a really good idea where our young guys are and where they are headed. Next off season we should be much more active in free agency since we should have a good idea what we really need. I think this season since we didn't get Milsap we will compete for the 8th seed but fall short.
OrlandoMagic,3bra71,mjridiculouz,9,Wed Jul 1 14:47:41 2015 UTC,Does he want to be another All-Star on a team full of them or THE All-Star on a team leading us to the playoffs? I think everyone wants a little recognition.
OrlandoMagic,3bra71,UpvotesArePeople,3,Wed Jul 1 14:57:28 2015 UTC,"What should be?   State tax. Likely hood of being a title contender in ATL for less money (factoring sales tax) vs a playoff team in Orlando for more money (again, sales tax).   If he thinks ATL can't really be a title contender, why not make a little more money on a similarly playoff bound team? But if he, for whatever reason, thinks ATL can win it all, stay in ATL"
OrlandoMagic,3bra71,ajax0626,2,Wed Jul 1 16:18:55 2015 UTC,"You still have to pay out of state taxes for visiting games, FYI. But living here, that definitely helps."
OrlandoMagic,3bra71,EyeoftheTyga,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:28:35 2015 UTC,Looks like ATL now got Tiago Splitter in a trade. They for sure can not retain both Milsap and Carroll. Maybe they know Milsap is coming over.
OrlandoMagic,3bra71,onlysame1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:57:33 2015 UTC,Carrolls gone now. I think Millsap will be gone too. With Horford at PF and Splitter at C I don't see room for Millsap.
OrlandoMagic,3bra71,whtge8,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:14:13 2015 UTC,"My wonder is do they sign back Millsap, have Horford play his natural position of PF, Splitter at center, Korver at SG, and Teague at PG? Or do they let Millsap go, try and get a S&T with Harris, and substitute Harris for Millsap in that lineup?"
OrlandoMagic,3bra71,EyeoftheTyga,-1,Wed Jul 1 16:28:00 2015 UTC,Did you really just say Orlando has a better chance of beating the cavs than the hawks...and that Gordon would be a 5x better defender than sefolosha?
OrlandoMagic,3bra71,Abiv23,3,Wed Jul 1 15:45:35 2015 UTC,It's a matter of who is gonna be better at containing LeBron and Kyrie and I believe that Orlando has better players to do that than Atlanta.  And you really think sefolosha is big enough to stay with LeBron? Are you okay?
OrlandoMagic,3bra71,SuperBowlDolphin,3,Wed Jul 1 15:55:30 2015 UTC,"Lol Hawks are so much better then the Magic. Yeah we got swept but went 3-1 against them in the regular season while y'all went 0-3 against them. There's another reason we had 60 wins & y'all had 25.  Edit- Also y'all may be a playoff team in 4 years but definetly not on the same level as the Cavs, Spurs, Hawks, or Warriors are at now"
OrlandoMagic,3bra71,SuperBowlDolphin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:29:43 2015 UTC,Right now? Yes the Hawks are of course better but you can't tell me that for the next 4 years the Hawks will easily have a better chance than the Magic. Year 1 and maybe Year 2 yes but Year 3 and 4 if a majority of things go well for us we should pass you guys talent wise.
OrlandoMagic,3bra71,SuperBowlDolphin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:33:37 2015 UTC,"We might've had one good year but I'd take that over nothing. Hardaway's 23, Bazemore just turned 26 today, Shröder's 22, Teague 27, & Horford is 29. That could easily last another 4 years with that core if not getting better."
OrlandoMagic,3bra71,SuperBowlDolphin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:39:57 2015 UTC,I'll take Orlando's core over Atlanta's core if i'm Millsap JUST because of Aaron Gordon and Elfrid Payton being very good options for trying to contain LeBron and Irving because all in all that's what it comes down to.
OrlandoMagic,3bra71,EyeoftheTyga,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:41:29 2015 UTC,"A team lead by Millsap, Payton, Gordon, Oladipo, & Vuvevic couldn't make it far enough to play LeBron though."
OrlandoMagic,3bra71,Abiv23,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:47:02 2015 UTC,Vucevic/Oladipo/Payton/Hezonja/Gordon/Harris are all considered to have all-star potential. If two of those guys become all-stars along with Millsap then I don't see why they can't make it far enough. The only competition is Washington with Wall/Beal (Nene and Gortat are declining) And then Chicago will Butler (Noah and Rose aswell if healthy)
OrlandoMagic,3brj7f,IOnlyCareAboutIrony,5,Wed Jul 1 15:56:00 2015 UTC,"I think we'd go into the tax for one year to make a big jump towards contender status.  If we can move Frye, all the better."
OrlandoMagic,3brj7f,deafcon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:12:53 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm thinking too, and it's definitely the right move. There is no way we can move Frye without giving up some kind of asset, and next year he wouldn't cause many tax issues anyway."
OrlandoMagic,3brj7f,EyeoftheTyga,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:24:23 2015 UTC,"Wonder if Harris would be pissed though since that's his cousin lol  But in all seriousness, totally down to ship off Frye."
OrlandoMagic,3brj7f,REEB,3,Wed Jul 1 16:42:20 2015 UTC,Salary cap and luxury tax lines are different. Luxury tax level will probably be over $80 million next season since it was near $77 million this year.
OrlandoMagic,3bu7v4,OrangeKookie,12,Thu Jul 2 04:48:38 2015 UTC,We're not in the mood.
OrlandoMagic,3bu7v4,UpvotesArePeople,8,Thu Jul 2 05:33:58 2015 UTC,We'll match. Henni won't lose him now.
OrlandoMagic,3bu7v4,matty_hawk,4,Thu Jul 2 05:25:26 2015 UTC,You guys don't have the cap space anymore.
OrlandoMagic,3bu7v4,titanzero,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:56:02 2015 UTC,Apparently celtics might trade away Gerald wallace with a first round pick to make room. So there's always the possibility. Idek if I want him as I've never seen him play.
OrlandoMagic,3bu7v4,REEB,2,Thu Jul 2 12:31:08 2015 UTC,Don't waste your time...  we are matching. Plus latest Celtics rumor is they have stopped pursuing him
OrlandoMagic,3bu7v4,tropicalrecon,-5,Thu Jul 2 12:38:12 2015 UTC,Ummm he's a bitch
OrlandoMagic,3brvgo,UpvotesArePeople,12,Wed Jul 1 17:23:06 2015 UTC,"Not sure I buy it, our FO is generally pretty tight-lipped. Maybe this was leaked by us to discourage poison-pill contract offer sheets?"

OrlandoMagic,3brvgo,IteLacerti,3,Wed Jul 1 17:33:32 2015 UTC,but...but why??
OrlandoMagic,3brvgo,IteLacerti,4,Wed Jul 1 17:25:07 2015 UTC,"I mean, there is no reason to take this hardline position. It's not like we already signed Millsap and have cap concerns. If anything, we may be undecided on the max. But there's no way it's set in stone to let him walk at that price."
OrlandoMagic,3brvgo,xiedian,3,Wed Jul 1 17:30:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah it doesn't make sense, especially since Millsap is still up in the air. Probably a smokescreen."

OrlandoMagic,3brvgo,kevinnewman4life,2,Wed Jul 1 17:24:55 2015 UTC,RIP THE DREAM BOYS
OrlandoMagic,3brvgo,tropicalrecon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:30:01 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I think this is true but let's see someone actually pony up the money first. We know what the Magic think he's worth.   However he does have the leverage to get more. Look at Khris Middleton's 5 year 70 million dollar deal. Makes it a tough market.
OrlandoMagic,3brvgo,whtge8,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:35:51 2015 UTC,OK if that happens then I'm fine with Milsap.
OrlandoMagic,3brvgo,onlysame1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:37:52 2015 UTC,Don't believe it.
OrlandoMagic,3brvgo,anonymousacg,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:37:16 2015 UTC,eh...... i call bullshit. the source is with Boston and our team is very good at keeping things tight lipped. And it would make so sense to sign Milsap if we are letting Harris go.

OrlandoMagic,3brdhi,zakadak,7,Wed Jul 1 15:12:54 2015 UTC,"Sending him a qualifying offer sheet just makes him a Restricted Free Agent. So other teams can offer him, but after he agrees a deal we have the opportunity to match it and keep him"
OrlandoMagic,3bropx,albinorhino21,6,Wed Jul 1 16:34:37 2015 UTC,"tbh I'd rather have Harris than Millsap if it's one of the other, but my dream would be both."

OrlandoMagic,3bropx,UpvotesArePeople,2,Wed Jul 1 16:35:20 2015 UTC,I really want to see how both will do on the same team
OrlandoMagic,3bropx,xiedian,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:03:42 2015 UTC,"Still doesn't explain why they got Splitter. That allows Horford to move back to his natural position at PF, leaving Millsap the odd man out."
OrlandoMagic,3bpjwy,GSN1PA360,16,Wed Jul 1 03:02:11 2015 UTC,Hell no to Psycho T. Don't want that scum on this team.
OrlandoMagic,3bpjwy,REEB,2,Wed Jul 1 03:11:35 2015 UTC,Is this the year we finally sign CJ Watson?
OrlandoMagic,3bpjwy,ajax0626,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:24:47 2015 UTC,That's one depressing list.
OrlandoMagic,3bpjwy,RWJ1985,0,Wed Jul 1 11:22:27 2015 UTC,"Millsap is another combo forward. He's better than all the ones we have, but how would that help any holes of ours really in that position? Thad just signed, RoLo would be nice, but the others like Psycho T and Ed Davis don't make sense IMO. Stuckey or Watson would be okay."
OrlandoMagic,3bpjwy,EyeoftheTyga,2,Wed Jul 1 06:04:17 2015 UTC,"Millsap is another combo forward   I would disagree with this. The bulk of his career minutes are slotted in the 4 with him seeing more time at the 5 than the 3. I actually really think Millsap would be the best FA pickup for this club of the entire lot (save for LMA only because his stroke is dangerously wet).  I agree with Stuckey as the backup PG, I think he'd be a decent pickup if we aren't able to grab someone else in a swap. I also like Brooks.  Also a name I haven't seen these writers throw up is Brandan Wright. We know that Rob has coveted him in the past and I think now that he's a FA again, we may see his name emerge. Rob loves those advanced statistics and Wright (prior to last season) had some big spikes for the Mavs.  I also like Robin Lopez and Asik but, that's me."
OrlandoMagic,3bpjwy,rtillaree,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:29:23 2015 UTC,"Well I clearly was wrong. We're in the hunt now. Wright isn't a great defender, but good bench center that I would take."
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,goat_justinanderson,10,Wed Jul 1 23:13:11 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that's moronic.  Mario can play the 2 and 3, eventually the 4 even.  Harris can play both forwards spots.  They could both play 35+ minutes a game.  I really don't see an issue.  Plus, it takes time for guys to develop.  Saying Keeping Harris would stunt Mario's development is a totally contrived argument."
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,CaptainBananaFish,-6,Wed Jul 1 23:33:23 2015 UTC,"Hezonja should start. Unless you start Harris at the 4 that doesn't happen. The kid needs to be a featured point of the team. You don't draft an Andrew wiggins or Jabari Parker to play a limited role. This kid is that talented. The best rookies are the ones who get the opportunity as a rookie to be a feature point. Harris is just filling up space as a below average top scorer. Hezonja should be that guy. This kid is a potential superstar, you don't hold back Anthony Davis, don't hold back mario"
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,REEB,6,Wed Jul 1 23:38:28 2015 UTC,Are you a Magic fan or some sort of Hezonja fanboy?
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,REEB,-1,Thu Jul 2 01:02:10 2015 UTC,Unaffiliated NBA fan who thinks hezonja is one of the best talents in a while
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,REEB,5,Thu Jul 2 01:17:52 2015 UTC,Nobody in this sub is going to take you seriously if you can't be more objective. If you're not interested in that then you can either lurk quietly or get the fuck out.
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,Swalrus,-3,Thu Jul 2 01:24:27 2015 UTC,"I'm being as objective as I can. I don't know hezonja, what benefit do I get from thinking he's going to be good? None. My unbiased view of him as a basketball player is that he's going to be really good. It's not that difficult to comprehend"
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,Swalrus,3,Thu Jul 2 01:32:29 2015 UTC,I've read your comments. You're not being objective at all. You're all in on hezonja.
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,Swalrus,-2,Thu Jul 2 01:43:45 2015 UTC,I'm all in because i think he is that good. I'm not being subjective in my belief that he is a great talent. That's based purely on what him as a player and a person
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,ynksjts,3,Thu Jul 2 02:00:51 2015 UTC,What is your assessment based on though? Highlight films and second hand talent assessments?
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,EyeoftheTyga,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:41:43 2015 UTC,"Many things, ill keep it relatively brief  His body: 6'8"". Ridiculous explosive. Wide shoulders with a great frame, already has a good strength base. Perfect body to add plenty of muscle. Basically a+ on body  Shooting. Beautiful shot. Gets around screens with good footwork. High release point with good elevation. Swishes often, so you know he's got a consistent arc on his shot. I say he's the best shooter in the draft except maybe justin Anderson. Booker 3rd  Vision. He has vision and shown that he can see some plays before they happen. He does try to force it at times and make it too fancy. Plus he's selfish so he doesn't always try to pass it. It's a work in progress but I think he can be a 5-7 assist guy down the line. The vision is there  Attitude. Super hard worker. But he is big headed. This is the X factor. I think his confidence is what is going to make him a superstar. I think he backs up his attitude with work ethic. But I admit this is the biggest risk. Ultimately I think his work ethic and going to a stable organization with good guys like oladipo and Payton around him helps him use his attitude to develop into a superstar rather than work himself out of the league  Defensively, he's got textbook athleticism and size. All he has to do is try and he will be a plus defender  Ultimately, I think it takes a little bit of adjustment time to understand how to be a better decision maker and not go the jr smith route. But I think he's not stupid like jr, so he figures it out. Hopefully he gets it after the first half of the season. Within 3 years I see him as a 18-4-4 guy"
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,Swalrus,3,Thu Jul 2 03:23:30 2015 UTC,"You don't know the answer to that question. I don't know, Henni doesn't know. No one knows. As a small market team we have to find out what we have before sending away any asset because as we just saw with Millsap it is difficult to get someone to come play with a bunch of unknown entities in Orlando."
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,Swalrus,-3,Wed Jul 1 23:22:18 2015 UTC,"Is it worth a max contract for Harris? Let's say hezonja is the real deal, what the heck do you do with him? I don't think Harris is going to be a star its safe to say, but hezonja has the capability. I think it's a bigger risk to keep and overpay Harris and hurt hezonjas development then to just let him go or trade him and give hezonja the chance to shine"
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,Swalrus,2,Wed Jul 1 23:28:41 2015 UTC,It's not a normal year. The cap is not the same. We have to lock down assets until we know what we have. It is just as likely that Mario never comes good in the NBA. You sign Harris and wait or if a great trade comes up that allows us to trade him for a well suited PF we send him out.
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,EyeoftheTyga,-4,Wed Jul 1 23:35:13 2015 UTC,There is very little shot he ends up not great in the NBA if he gets the chance to develop. What do you do with Mario if Harris is still here next year?
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,EyeoftheTyga,2,Wed Jul 1 23:41:40 2015 UTC,"Hezonja averaged 15 minutes per game in Europe and has a little bit of a rep as being arrogant which is not necessarily a bad thing.  Why hand him a starting job? Why not make him earn it?  If he dominates the summer league, you'll know you have a potential star.Harris is 22, if you think he's hit his ceiling, let him go.  But he has improved every year.  15 million in todays market is like 11 in last year's."
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,EyeoftheTyga,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:01:11 2015 UTC,Reasonable answer
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,whtge8,2,Thu Jul 2 11:42:21 2015 UTC,"Cause we need offense, and a lot of us want the playoffs now, and don't want to wait for Hezonja to develop"
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,onlysame1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:23:38 2015 UTC,"Hezonja has the talent, he just needs playing time to work on his decision making. The magic don't make the roster without millsap if they don't allow hezonja the chance to become a star. Plus hezonja is a terrific scorer. Hezonja can give 15+ next year if he gets the opportunity"
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,matty_hawk,3,Wed Jul 1 23:26:21 2015 UTC,And Michael Beasley was going to do the same and Greg Oden was going to be the next great Center. I agree Mario has promise but that is so speculative.
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,CT_Real,-3,Wed Jul 1 23:37:43 2015 UTC,He's a sure thing if he gets to play. Oden was injured and Beasley fucked himself over by being a world class dummy.
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,ntcougar,2,Wed Jul 1 23:39:36 2015 UTC,"And based on your expert opinion there is a 0% chance a 20 year old European who we know little about, has never lived in the U.S. or played against NBA competition could be a bust. Damn I wish I could be so blindly ignorant."
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,ntcougar,-4,Wed Jul 1 23:47:04 2015 UTC,"None of these rookies have played NBA games before. The competition in the Euroleague is just as good, probably better than ncaa. Ok, it's fine to say he's not a 100% sure thing. But he's as close to a sure thing as ANYONE else in the draft. He's that good. You wouldn't bench towns or Russell to let them come on slowly. Let the kid hit the ground running and within a few months he will be great"
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,Swalrus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:52:03 2015 UTC,If you can't get a legit power forward in a trade for Harris  you don't trade a three point threat who can put up 20 a game just to give more playing time to an unknown quantity. You can play both of them at the same time. Without a legit PF were not a playoff team. Play them both until we know what we have.
OrlandoMagic,3bt7e5,bk10287,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:01:08 2015 UTC,Winning over rookie development IMO. I don't think we can sacrifice winning for development
OrlandoMagic,3bol8r,fawazlle,6,Tue Jun 30 21:52:48 2015 UTC,"I had never heard of him until we picked him, and IMO is the perfect second round pick. High reward, no risk."
OrlandoMagic,3bol8r,stinx2001,3,Tue Jun 30 23:26:01 2015 UTC,"Everything I've heard of him makes him sound like that Green guy on the nuggets last year, rookie. Led the nation in scoring, good shooter, and played for a mid major school. Reason behind his scoring could be because he was the only option on that team but who knows hopefully he can be a good and consistent shooter for us."
OrlandoMagic,3bol8r,ninety4kid,3,Tue Jun 30 22:12:59 2015 UTC,"He's no Erick Green. Erick Green went to Virginia Tech, which is not a mid major and was a 6'2 point guard on a horrible team where he was literally the only option. Green honestly wasn't all that suited for the PG position because of his size, but he was relegated to that role due to Va. Tech's needs. Harvey on the other hand is 6'4, has no issue creating his own shot, and plays well off the ball. I see some similarities between the two, but Harvey will have a better career IMO..not that I think he's the second coming or anything but he'll definitely contribute."
OrlandoMagic,3bol8r,UnfairWalnuts,3,Wed Jul 1 13:52:59 2015 UTC,"Im definitely hyped to see him in Summer League. If his shooting carries over to the NBA, him and Fournier would be deadly off of the bench. However, I dont know and havnt heard much about his defense. His questions on the defensive end might be why a lot of teams passed on him.  Maybe he can be the answer for our need of a backup PG if he can play the 1, or maybe hes one of the best if not the best 2nd rounder in this draft and could be starting caliber for us, who knows."
OrlandoMagic,3bol8r,GSN1PA360,3,Tue Jun 30 22:20:30 2015 UTC,"True, haven't heard much about his D.   I do think he will be a solid back up rookie pg that is ready to play.   Dare I say his step back 3 is Curry like?"

OrlandoMagic,3bol8r,REEB,3,Wed Jul 1 02:06:46 2015 UTC,"His defensive rating in college was awful. Plus, he might be the weakest leaping guard in the NBA (28.5 max vert). I hope his shooting at least translates... would be great if he could be a third stringer for us. Unleash him during blowouts and watch him drop 3 point bombs all over the place in garbage time lol."
OrlandoMagic,3bol8r,NZMagic,2,Wed Jul 1 00:32:53 2015 UTC,Will hopefully make the roster as a 3rd string pg. We need a vet pg..

OrlandoMagic,3bol8r,BrotherBroseph,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:50:37 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm stoked on Tyler, if we need scoring we can just input him with Hezonja or Fournier to spread the floor. Although he reminds me a lot of Seth Curry, which kinda just makes me wonder why we don't just sign Seth."
OrlandoMagic,3bol8r,jarethcutestory,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:12:30 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately not, because this is Seth Curry all over again from last year.   There are always gems in the draft, free agency, etc. I'm a huge believer in that. Having said that, as I get older, the more I realize the chances of these 2nd round guys blossoming into what I think there potential is is slim to none. They are 2nd round/undrafted guys for a reason. For every Draymond Green, there are 20 other guys who don't ever even sniff an NBA bench.   If he has the greatest shooting display in the history of summer league, and plays competent defense, I'll say he has a small shot. Other than that, it doesn't fair well for him."
OrlandoMagic,3bol8r,tropicalrecon,0,Wed Jul 1 13:39:37 2015 UTC,No
OrlandoMagic,3bo9qw,rope009,3,Tue Jun 30 20:28:51 2015 UTC,I like his stroke
OrlandoMagic,3bo9qw,Ellimistopher,3,Wed Jul 1 02:06:07 2015 UTC,Very excited for all of the Summer League heat checks that are coming.
OrlandoMagic,3bo9qw,ajax0626,2,Wed Jul 1 02:14:21 2015 UTC,Anyone else notice he carries the ball a lot?
OrlandoMagic,3bokga,Madhairman12,6,Tue Jun 30 21:46:57 2015 UTC,Im just glad he isnt looking to be another Fran Vazquez.
OrlandoMagic,3bokga,GSN1PA360,3,Tue Jun 30 22:23:53 2015 UTC,I'm glad for that too. The buyout immediately happened and he at least has a fearless attitude. Can that be a deterrent? Sure. But it's easier to get a guy like MARIO to tone it down than for a quiet guy to get fired up.
OrlandoMagic,3bokga,houseQM,2,Wed Jul 1 02:14:08 2015 UTC,"was hoping to get mario. bit jelous of you guys, im fairly happy with porzingis but hezonja was my favorite in the draft.  First off, dont worry too much about the europeans. seriously that is far overstated. they get singled out and you hear names like bargnani instead of dirk, parker, gasol, petrovic. fact is europeans probably been giving far better bang for the pick historicly.   The thing i would worry about is the amount of minutes available to hezonja. he wants to play, and i somewhat doubt his patience is that great. your backcourt is pretty stacked, and he is gonna have to fit in there.   But other than that, i think you got the player with the most upside, he got a great work ethic. he is athletic, and his shot is spot on fantastic.  he could be an all-star in time. He got the shot that could end up being in the top of the league and he knows the way to the basket/line. he didn't play euro ball, he played nba ball. that made him rather unpopular with his team in europe."
OrlandoMagic,3bokga,S1212,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:54:33 2015 UTC,Heh-zone-yah. I've never seen a foreign player who plays like he's from the streets. I love the swagger and his confidence. There's a chance he could be a bust. But I also get this feeling that he'll be one of the best players in magic history. He just has that look about him. His highlights are sick and I'm totally surprised Phil Jackson passed on an athletic jordan/kobe-esque shooting guard.
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,rtillaree,7,Tue Jun 30 15:20:03 2015 UTC,Thought we would let O'Quinn walk. I hope he stays though. I met him in person and he is a great guy. He is always hyped on the bench too no matter if he doesn't get any minutes.
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,whtge8,11,Tue Jun 30 15:26:20 2015 UTC,"I think we need to bring him back. Outside of the big PFs on the market, there's no one I'd rather have out there than KOQ. Not Biyombo, Ed Davis, Quincy Acy...   Get Kyle back in the high post and away from that shitty 3pt line experiment Vaughn had him at and let him be a creator on offense and be money with the elbow jumper like he was as a 2nd year player."
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,jive_turkey,7,Tue Jun 30 15:31:31 2015 UTC,"Ugh Vaughn ruined players. Remember how promising Nicholson and Harkless looked their rookie years? O'Quinn was a knockdown mid-range shooter, excellent rebounder and passer, and a decent shot blocker. Now they all suck, or maybe just didn't have the motivation to play for Vaughn."
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,whtge8,3,Tue Jun 30 15:33:12 2015 UTC,"O'Quinn had a stretch when Vucevic was out where he put up fantastic numbers. I don't know why people want us to chase bigs when KOQ fits every single request that we've been asking for. He has an awesome midrange game, he's a true shot blocker, he's as strong as an ox, and he is a good locker room guy.  If we just played him we would get exactly what we've been looking for."
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,matty_hawk,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:41:16 2015 UTC,Yeah. I hope Skiles gets more use out of him. Vaughn was horrible. You could go from 30 minutes in one game to DNP coaches decision without warning.
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,whtge8,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:49:10 2015 UTC,"Yep, especially after a solid outing. iirc he played 30+ minutes one night, was in total control, 2 nights later he played >10, then got a DNP-CD.  Same problem Nicholson had the season before. was destroying the Pacers in the opener, got benched at the half and didnt return, then got lost at the end of the bench."
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,matty_hawk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:33:48 2015 UTC,I remember that game. He was going off. Scored like 10 in the first quarter didn't he? I'm so excited to see what a real coach can do.
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,whtge8,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:36:55 2015 UTC,"Just looked over his stats here: http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/oquinky01/gamelog/2015/  The most interesting games/minutes allocated was:  12/2/2014, Golden state agonizing loss by 1 point. He played 27 minutes for 21 points, 11 rebounds, then played 6 the next night.  12/23/2014, , Boston a win where he had 18 and 13 in 34 minutes, 3 nights later he played 16 minutes, and didnt score"
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,matty_hawk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:56:27 2015 UTC,"But... ""Match ups"" ugh. Glad he's gone."
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,whtge8,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:08:40 2015 UTC,"You know you say that and I feel like I truly have forgotten about some of the talent on our roster that Vaughn thoroughly destroyed... Maybe skiles can get more out of O'Quinn, Nicholson, and Harkless.  All three are good players that could help round out our team, they just need some more growth and consistency"
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,bk10287,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:53:27 2015 UTC,"The only player on our list im not massively high on is Nicholson. I think he offers the least defensively out of all our bigs, and offensively i dont think he makes up for it. I hope he can prove me wrong, either with us, or somewhere else, but he's the one i doubt the most.  Harkless and KOQ have both had solid outings this past season, so im pretty confident that they can improve, especially considering they both prosper on the defensive end. The majority of the pieces are here for us to nurture and make a serious tilt at a championship, it's just a matter of being patient, and allowing them to grow imo."
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,matty_hawk,4,Wed Jul 1 05:25:21 2015 UTC,"Thought we would let O'Quinn walk   either way, he's an asset and you don't let assets just fall off the table......in many cases at least."
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,REEB,3,Tue Jun 30 15:27:41 2015 UTC,He was a beast his sophomore year. Hopefully letting him jack 3s last season pays off and he doesn't get any major offers.
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,xiedian,4,Tue Jun 30 17:46:21 2015 UTC,"I hope we can re-sign O'Quinn to a team friendly deal, maybe like a 3yr-9/12 mil . I love this guy and the energy he brings as a backup big."
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,dleec,4,Tue Jun 30 15:31:00 2015 UTC,"Yup, I was thinking in that same range of money. He's a great team asset and definitely helps with energy on and off the bench"
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,UpvotesArePeople,3,Tue Jun 30 19:08:38 2015 UTC,And now we wait.
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,EyeoftheTyga,3,Tue Jun 30 15:24:32 2015 UTC,"does this mean that we want to keep Kyle, since he's now RFA?"
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,BucHerRightInDaPussy,3,Tue Jun 30 15:48:12 2015 UTC,Either that or we want to try and trade him.
OrlandoMagic,3bn20c,REEB,3,Tue Jun 30 15:49:37 2015 UTC,"I think it means that it's just business and we want to have some kind of leverage in the assets, we can now match any offers for these pieces. I think trade kickers are going to be thrown around a lot this offseason and that may be a hurdle but I doubt anyone pounds down doors for KoQ. Not really sure how Rob sees him, in particular, fitting with his vision."
OrlandoMagic,3bn870,blinkz,12,Tue Jun 30 16:04:46 2015 UTC,"Can't wait to see Payton, Gordon, and Hezonja run the fast break. Find Gordon for the lob or kick it out to Hezonja for the 3. That's going to be really hard to defend."
OrlandoMagic,3bn870,whtge8,4,Tue Jun 30 16:29:43 2015 UTC,And put Harvey out there filling the outside lane for the three.   Even tougher to defend.
OrlandoMagic,3bn870,houseQM,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:11:21 2015 UTC,I thought you said and and was imagining a crazy fast break alley oop then pass out to the corner play. It was an exciting thought.
OrlandoMagic,3bn870,OllieWillie,5,Tue Jun 30 21:44:32 2015 UTC,I'm pretty pumped to see the Blue team.
OrlandoMagic,3bn870,EyeoftheTyga,4,Tue Jun 30 16:05:09 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, we got Glen Rice JR"
OrlandoMagic,3bn870,rtillaree,3,Tue Jun 30 17:19:57 2015 UTC,that's a lot of names
OrlandoMagic,3bn870,JoePesciOfGoneFishin,3,Tue Jun 30 17:42:15 2015 UTC,It's cool to see Andrew Nicholson's Bona teammate Youssou N'doye is on there. He's probably not up to NBA levels but it'll be fun watching him.
OrlandoMagic,3bn870,SamuelMuniz,3,Tue Jun 30 19:37:38 2015 UTC,I still don't understand why we have two teams.
OrlandoMagic,3bn870,houseQM,6,Tue Jun 30 17:58:28 2015 UTC,"not sure, but Blue is obviously for the main roster guys to get used to each other in a more relaxed environment and White is for probable training camp guys."
OrlandoMagic,3bn870,bk10287,2,Tue Jun 30 18:12:07 2015 UTC,Yea same here... Why do we have so many players... Because the bayhawks maybe?
OrlandoMagic,3bn870,ninety4kid,2,Tue Jun 30 18:00:21 2015 UTC,Might as well since we don't participate in the Vegas summer league. I think maybe a team dropped from the Orlando summer league and were just filling it since we're hosts.
OrlandoMagic,3bn870,SamuelMuniz,2,Tue Jun 30 18:33:53 2015 UTC,Yeah...I wonder why we still even host a summer league when the Vegas one is so much bigger.
OrlandoMagic,3bn870,ninety4kid,2,Tue Jun 30 18:40:19 2015 UTC,I currently live in Vegas and would love if our boys in blue came to play here for summer league.
OrlandoMagic,3bn870,ajax0626,2,Tue Jun 30 18:41:54 2015 UTC,I believe it is a result of a team leaving the Orlando Summer league to play in Las Vegas. Leaving Orlando Summer league with an uneven number of teams. I may be completely wrong.

OrlandoMagic,3bm12w,OllieWillie,12,Tue Jun 30 08:42:50 2015 UTC,"I'm actually in the process of starting an Orlando Magic podcast-- still in the planning stages but I'll definitely update you once I'm a bit further!!  I'm daily listener of the Starters / Believe the Hype NBA / Zach Lowe / (formerly) Bill simmons / etc etc..  If anyone wants to get involved send me a PM!   I'll be making a post about it in the coming weeks, probably going to release the first episode sometime during or upon the conclusion of Summer league."
OrlandoMagic,3bm12w,greenskeeper87,2,Tue Jun 30 13:25:16 2015 UTC,"The Orlando Magic fan base is an underserved market in the radio & podcast industry. Your first shows will inevitably be a bit rough around the edges. Do not be discouraged. This is something that is very needed & you'd be filling a pretty big void. If you have the means to keep up with the team on a regular basis, catch every game, and provide a panel of a couple/few hosts that can provide interesting tactical & analytical insight, you'll have a winner in the long run, even if production quality, on-air chemistry, etc. take some time to refine. Think of it like the build the team has been doing the last couple of years - build for the long-term. I wish you the best of luck & can't wait to hear the first episode. Thanks for making the effort to give this fan base some coverage in an area we've lacked for some reason."
OrlandoMagic,3bm12w,mufcreddevil7,3,Tue Jun 30 13:41:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the support! Having been born and raised here, I'm a diehard. The lack of coverage from the national sports media is sad. Look at this screenshot I took during the playoffs:: http://i.imgur.com/h0xg1nN.jpg . How the fuck is NBA.com calling Oladipo a PG after we just started Elf for the entire second half of the season and he was the only rookie to drop back to back trip-dubs ever.. And Dipo is our PG?

OrlandoMagic,3bm12w,greenskeeper87,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:17:35 2015 UTC,I just re-read this and wanted to say thanks for this. There are often times doubts when undertaking a project and I really appreciate your sentiment.

OrlandoMagic,3bm12w,RainbowSkull,7,Wed Jul 1 12:47:08 2015 UTC,"I think the Magic are the worst team in the league in terms of quantity of good reporting.  Sure, we've got a few great people out there, but nowhere near the level of other small market teams like the Wolves, the Grizzlies, or the Jazz."
OrlandoMagic,3bm12w,kevinnewman4life,5,Tue Jun 30 13:57:22 2015 UTC,I totally agree. The sentinel writers are so pessimistic
OrlandoMagic,3bm12w,jp4est,3,Tue Jun 30 19:27:47 2015 UTC,"Front page of the sentinel sports yesterday had Kevin Love's photo on it, suggesting Rob Hennigan wouldn't be doing his job if he didn't go after him.  The level of idiot it takes to write that column and think, ""I did well today"" is astounding."
OrlandoMagic,3bm12w,kevinnewman4life,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:30:47 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I am a little confused about the strategy that we should not spend on free agents this summer. Isn't this exactly the summer we should be? The cap is going to go up and make any contract increase in value due to a new scale being introduced."
OrlandoMagic,3bm12w,jp4est,2,Tue Jun 30 21:11:35 2015 UTC,I don't think the strategy is to not spend. I think the strategy is to swing on 1.C guys like a Paul Millsap and if we miss don't overpay just to spend money.
OrlandoMagic,3bm12w,kevinnewman4life,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:34:47 2015 UTC,Hm I haven't heard that one or anything of that caliber. Just about Quincy Acy and Thad Young. Why aren't we scheduling meetings?
OrlandoMagic,3bm12w,clown-from-neck-down,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:47:49 2015 UTC,"side note: the cap is going up each year for the next 3 years, so this isn't the only good offseason to sign FAs.   We obviously should still try to go after whoever we want this year, but we'll be in a much better position to sign free agents in the next two years if we can get out of the lottery. If we start putting some wins together then it'll be much more realistic to lure a really good player here in FA."
OrlandoMagic,3bm12w,kevinnewman4life,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:52:32 2015 UTC,Ok understood. So the CBA will be the major change in player scaled contracts but necessarily the cap increases?
OrlandoMagic,3bm12w,mjridiculouz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:02:20 2015 UTC,"100% agree.   As an example, the magic mobile site says ""wrong version of flasg"". The rest of the world is using HTML 3, not us."
OrlandoMagic,3bm12w,jsf13,5,Tue Jun 30 21:36:47 2015 UTC,"OMD is the only Magic podcast I know about and they are alright but I can't stand the lack of professional equipment they have. I'm not some quality whore by the way but you can't really listen to something for 30-40 minutes if it doesn't sound good, it's just like watching something in 240p for that same amount of time.  Anyways I would and have been considering doing some sort of Youtube series about the Magic and also writing articles/blogs for practice in what I want to get into when I grow up which is broadcasting but the problem is if you are gonna focus on a specific team (like I would be for this said series) I would need another person because people will get bored of listening to a single person ramble for 10-15 minutes while if I had a 2nd person that would hopefully disagree with me it could atleast be an interesting listen and have you ponder about who's side you prefer in certain ways of thinking and etc etc."

OrlandoMagic,3bo224,melvin445,3,Tue Jun 30 19:33:40 2015 UTC,I think he'll be fine... its just summer league.   I kind of wanted him really badly here in Orlando but oh well.
OrlandoMagic,3bo224,fawazlle,-4,Tue Jun 30 21:54:04 2015 UTC,Wish I could see him play this summer but I feel like this is pretty much how his whole career will go.
OrlandoMagic,3bo224,REEB,8,Tue Jun 30 19:34:34 2015 UTC,He projected that his younger brother could be back working out regularly in a few days.   Vegas SL doesn't start until July 10.
OrlandoMagic,3bo224,maxypooh15,7,Tue Jun 30 19:38:26 2015 UTC,Why would you feel that way? Has he missed any games in Europe? Hip tightness for a summer league game is nothing. Players are overtrained from training and draft workouts every day for the last month.
OrlandoMagic,3bogc9,Fruit_Pastilles,11,Tue Jun 30 21:16:55 2015 UTC,"Regardless of whether he's ""worth"" a max contract, it looks like the market will dictate that. He's a solid player already and still has more upside. If he continues to work on his 3 point shot and gets to the line a bit more, he'll be an offensive force and a matchup problem for SF/PF defending him."
OrlandoMagic,3bogc9,jive_turkey,3,Tue Jun 30 21:29:37 2015 UTC,upvote for being the only person who actually answered the question asked about your opinion of his game.
OrlandoMagic,3bogc9,fernballs,2,Wed Jul 1 13:54:21 2015 UTC,"We offered to extend him at about $9m/yr, which shows what we think he is worth. /u/reeb is correct, we match any price to prevent our best asset from walking for nothing."
OrlandoMagic,3bogc9,MelbourneFL321,2,Wed Jul 1 02:43:30 2015 UTC,"I think he returns to the Magic for something in the 12-14M range. I believe Vuce is getting just shy of 12 per year. The Magic have the cap space, and like others here it's a no brainer and doesn't sacrifice the team's rebuilding mission or compromise future cap integrity with it rising.   He will not walk but not sure where he will fit in if Mario plays the SF as he isn't a true PF. Still, you don't let an asset like Tobias walk, even if you don't plan to see him through to the end of the contract."
OrlandoMagic,3bogc9,RWJ1985,2,Wed Jul 1 11:19:19 2015 UTC,"Just gathering some information on him before we steal him from you guys.   Don't waste your time, we're matching. Future core piece or asset, doesn't matter. Makes no sense to not match with the cap going way up very soon."
OrlandoMagic,3bogc9,REEB,3,Tue Jun 30 21:25:10 2015 UTC,He's bad stay away from him. Go look elsewhere. Lol. We can't attract free agents so we're keeping our guy. I hope the sarcasm can be read in the first sentence.
OrlandoMagic,3bk0jv,DWilfred342,17,Mon Jun 29 21:14:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly why he was signed in the first place... dude is past his prime and still approaches the game as seriously as possible with his work ethic, diet, training, etc. Works harder than most players in the league. Great influence for our young players, not the cancer Charlotte fans told us he would be..."
OrlandoMagic,3bk0jv,REEB,4,Mon Jun 29 21:32:10 2015 UTC,"honestly, his situation in Orlando was much better than Charlotte. No real expectations and a group of young guys to mentor when he had to. Also, he basically auditioned for a playoff team and he provided solid minutes whenever we put him on the floor."
OrlandoMagic,3bk0jv,houseQM,8,Tue Jun 30 03:19:07 2015 UTC,I originally thought he was essentially getting paid $9 million to babysit. And I loved my babysitter when I was a kid.
OrlandoMagic,3bk0jv,maskedfox007,4,Mon Jun 29 23:24:22 2015 UTC,Someone had to do it. We all know Vaughn wasn't any sort of authority to the team. I'm glad he was there to set a good example for the squad.
OrlandoMagic,3bk0jv,Roycliffe,5,Mon Jun 29 23:55:32 2015 UTC,"Things like this are why I was okay with him on the team. And some of his hero ball tactics. But I am glad that we didn't keep him for next year, it would have been a waste of money for on the court, and a waste of a roster spot really."
OrlandoMagic,3bk0jv,EyeoftheTyga,8,Tue Jun 30 00:30:52 2015 UTC,Doubt Hennigan ever intended to bring him back. Probably just offered the 2nd year team option to motivate Gordon and also to leave open the possibility of using it in a trade.
OrlandoMagic,3bk0jv,REEB,4,Tue Jun 30 00:46:55 2015 UTC,I really love how Hennigan is cycling veterans through this team. Getting a lot of input and coaching from different veterans should really help the young players development. Bring Jameer home Rob!
OrlandoMagic,3bk0jv,whtge8,4,Mon Jun 29 23:57:31 2015 UTC,Would love Jameer

OrlandoMagic,3bl7rk,bizort,2,Tue Jun 30 11:03:34 2015 UTC,Nicholson is a horrible rebounder.
OrlandoMagic,3bkr2e,ominating,5,Tue Jun 30 00:50:42 2015 UTC,I don't think he would help us any. Dedmon is cheaper and better.
OrlandoMagic,3bkr2e,rsdio,3,Tue Jun 30 12:39:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm just really unimpressed with Biyombo, but I agree, I feel like Dedmon is the same player for less money."
OrlandoMagic,3bkr2e,ajax0626,3,Tue Jun 30 13:04:39 2015 UTC,Didn't he destroy us once when we played against Charlotte? I swear I remember him getting like 6 blocks against us.
OrlandoMagic,3bkr2e,whtge8,4,Tue Jun 30 13:44:28 2015 UTC,"He'd probably work very well for us on the defensive end. We'd probably need to turn Vuc into a PF again on offense in order to make up for Biyombo's lack of skills though. If we went this route, we'd need dipo and harris to improve their 3pt shooting if we are to truly make it work. Adding Hezonja helps, but I'm assuming he won't start in year 1. I'm all for it if we can get Biyombo for cheap enough to where we could without hesitation turn him into a backup if he doesn't pan out as a starter. A Frye/Biyombo backup rotation would be solid imo. Wonder if he can be had for 4-6 million?"
OrlandoMagic,3bkr2e,REEB,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:40:31 2015 UTC,I like this route. I could see Super Mario playing a lot of shooting guard also with Fournier at the point to give us a huge shooting front court and change of pace from our defensive minded starting back court.
OrlandoMagic,3bkr2e,ninety4kid,2,Tue Jun 30 05:11:21 2015 UTC,he was once touted as the next serge ibaka when he was drafted i think charlotte didnt develop him well enough i think we can use him especially paired with vuc think of him like a taj gibson player
OrlandoMagic,3bkr2e,JudeKen,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:43:06 2015 UTC,I asked this same question earlier when i heard he was being released.   Hes only 22 and with 1.5 bpg i think he could help us. If he was drafted by another team i think he would be a completely different player.
OrlandoMagic,3bkgs5,RWJ1985,4,Mon Jun 29 23:22:10 2015 UTC,"Man if you think we can land Kevin Love or LMA, I don't know what NBA you're following.  These are guys in the primes of their careers (LMA's is closing). They are getting offers from immediate championship contending teams. They are offering just as much money as we are, so why would they come to a bad team that is a few years away?    You guys need to be realistic about our situation. We're in the right direction, but we don't have the draw of an LA or Miami. Be patient in our rebuild, we'll be able to make a run at legit free agents in a year or two. We have a good group of young talent. We will be an attractive destination soon, just not yet."
OrlandoMagic,3bkgs5,ItoldonAnneFrank,4,Tue Jun 30 03:51:53 2015 UTC,"We're not making any splashes in FA this year.   As for the thing of the past: no. It's just not a thing that teams like us do, in a smaller market.   And as for the last part: You don't win in the offseason."
OrlandoMagic,3bkgs5,rps215,6,Tue Jun 30 00:27:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think we're in the running for a superstar yet. Love won't want to go come here nor would LMA. If we're gonna go after one it'll be next year after we can see how our guys gel with the new coach and who can become what.  Bismack Biyombo though, if we go hard after one guy I'd like him. Hes a better Kyle OQuinn, just not sure what type of $ hell be asking for, but he would be the answer to our rim protector off the bench. Plus he's only 22! If we can get him around 7-9 mil or so, he'd really help transform our defense. Just 0 offense though but we desperately need a defensive big and he's more poised than dedmon as a player but a lower offensive ceiling I think. Monroe is basically a poor man's Vucevic and will get paid more than he's worth."
OrlandoMagic,3bkgs5,kreynolds26,4,Mon Jun 29 23:29:00 2015 UTC,"He's slightly better than Dedmon, I'll give you that; but is he 6-7 million dollars better? I don't think so. Dedmon is a great player for us right now and I don't think Biyombo is the long term solution."
OrlandoMagic,3bkgs5,ItoldonAnneFrank,4,Tue Jun 30 03:53:53 2015 UTC,I agree. He's not much better than Kyle either
OrlandoMagic,3bkgs5,thug_life4,2,Tue Jun 30 04:00:44 2015 UTC,7-9 mil might be the ceiling. But I would take him at that price with the cap rise
OrlandoMagic,3bkgs5,rps215,3,Tue Jun 30 00:01:42 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely. If we get him at 3/24 that'd be worth it imo. He'll be coming off the books right as all our other guys will be up for new contracts and we'll have bird rights at that point if dipo and payton become max deserving players
OrlandoMagic,3bkgs5,kreynolds26,2,Tue Jun 30 00:16:53 2015 UTC,"We need that defense at the rim, and even if he's just a 15-20 minute guy off the bench and continues to have bad hands, it's still better than what we had this last year. I doubt the 8 mil is gonna hold us back from any big moves tbh."
OrlandoMagic,3bkgs5,rps215,3,Tue Jun 30 00:26:47 2015 UTC,Kind of difficult to convince the bigger free agents to come here after winning less than 26 games for 3 consecutive years. We need to sniff the playoffs if we want to be considered...
OrlandoMagic,3bkgs5,REEB,2,Tue Jun 30 00:34:20 2015 UTC,"Henny and Skiles have publicly said that next summer is the time when we go after a big time free agent. Makes sense, we could be considerable better making us a more attractive landing spot. I'm expecting us to get a solid back up PG and maybe a couple filler vets (a la Willie Green). Next year I'm thinking we go after the big names prob at the PF spot. Not too concerned though, we need our young guys to play big minutes so I kinda don't want us to make too big a move. For me next year is a success if our young core continue to develope and we make a push to get into the playoffs (I know, sounds just like last year but now we have a competent coach)."
OrlandoMagic,3bkgs5,alan4884,2,Tue Jun 30 00:40:09 2015 UTC,Amir Johnson: tenacious defender and showed he could shoot from outside  Bismack Biyombo: shot blocker  Jameer Nelson: bring him home to mentor   Jeremy Lin: depending in the price he could be a great scorer off the bench behind Payton   Trade: Derrick Favors and/or Trey Burke- don't know how much Utah would want for those two but either of these guys fills immediate needs.
OrlandoMagic,3bkgs5,ninety4kid,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:25:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know the jazz that well but I'm going to guess Favors is untouchable, Burke is a possibility but I doubt we have the appropriate assets to give up to get him"
OrlandoMagic,3bkgs5,Big_Apple3AM,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:56:34 2015 UTC,He's on the block. Well on draft day he was not sure about now. They have gobert to stifle the defense so there's no need to clog the paint with two defensive bigs. I thought I heard they were trying to move Favors in order to make a run at Milsap.
OrlandoMagic,3bkgs5,ninety4kid,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:01:12 2015 UTC,"Zach Lowe has an opinion on what we should do:   [Teams with cap room this summer like Orlando] should be hell-bent on using it. I don’t really even care who they sign, provided it’s not an obviously below-average player on the downswing. Pick a young or mid-career free agent and fucking splurge. Almost any deal with a solid player at $15 million or below this summer will look fine once the cap cracks $100 million. Have a jones for Khris Middleton? MAX HIM OUT. Hesitant to snap up Monroe in free agency because you already have one decent low-post guy? SIGN HIM ANYWAY. Does $12 million for DeMarre Carroll or Danny Green seem insane? They’re in their primes, and they do very important NBA things well. GO GET THEM. Barring disaster, all these guys will be on tradable contracts if the fit isn’t ideal on your team."

This isn't too farfetched. If someone pasted a tweet from Stephen Smith about Oladipo demanding a trade or some bullshit then I'll probably remove that.

OrlandoMagic,3bmt67,jive_turkey,3,Tue Jun 30 15:16:13 2015 UTC,I take all of these things with a grain of salt as should the rest of us but I only posted this because it's better than nothing being posted. We all have been thinking that we will match Harris no matter what so something like this could ATLEAST give us an idea of what we would do with no Harris and what we would do with said free salary cap if we don't have Harris.

OrlandoMagic,3bmt67,ajax0626,2,Tue Jun 30 14:14:15 2015 UTC,"Sucks for him that he doesn't really get a choice. If we want him we'll keep him. If we don't, we won't."
OrlandoMagic,3bmt67,rtillaree,2,Tue Jun 30 14:19:56 2015 UTC,I'm going 80/20 conjecture on this one even though I do personally feel Tobe wants to move on.
OrlandoMagic,3bmt67,UpvotesArePeople,2,Tue Jun 30 14:35:06 2015 UTC,"Tobias and his agent would need to take this position to have any leverage when seeking offers from other teams. They can't just say ""Oh, I'm happy with the Magic, but offer me a huge contract anyway."" The teams making the offers want to know that they actually have a shot at landing him. Tobias needs these offers to make his matched contract with the Magic as high as possible. So, even if he wouldn't mind returning to our squad, this would be the necessary scuttle put out by agents to other front offices. I wouldn't read too much into it."
OrlandoMagic,3bmt67,RainbowSkull,2,Tue Jun 30 15:19:25 2015 UTC,"Like most young NBA players, I'm sure Tobias dreams of leading the Knicks or the Lakers to the championship.  But even if that's his ""preference"" it does not mean he would not want to come back to Orlando."

OrlandoMagic,3bjdm4,ninety4kid,3,Mon Jun 29 20:39:53 2015 UTC,But in all seriousness I think Dedmon and O'Quinn both can fill our defensive needs under Skiles.
OrlandoMagic,3bjdm4,ninety4kid,2,Mon Jun 29 21:01:30 2015 UTC,"yup these two are the best realistic options bc Millsap wouldn't sign here and neither would Green, those are the only two from the list I would want"
OrlandoMagic,3bjdm4,thug_life4,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:58:42 2015 UTC,Ed Davis is the one that actually seems reasonable. Of course if for some reason Milsap wanted to come here for less than a max then I'd possibly be into it although it would hinder some of the young guys (who might never be as good as him). I'll be surprised if we really sign anybody at all aside from a backup point.

OrlandoMagic,3bgepq,UpvotesArePeople,4,Mon Jun 29 04:42:36 2015 UTC,Interesting that he wants to be a coach when all is said and done. I wonder if he'd have enough talent to make it in the NBA. Wasn't he the one behind our faster pace around the middle of last season?

OrlandoMagic,3bgv8i,mulberrybandit,6,Mon Jun 29 02:49:26 2015 UTC,I'm gonna say no. Indiana and Miami should be better with their injured stars back. I expect Stan to whip Detroit into shape and there's no reason the Bucks can't be in the hunt again.   The only team I see being much worse is Brooklyn. Even the shitty knicks might pick up a few more wins.  I think we will improve but I'm not sure we're a playoff team. A 15 win jump is a lot.
OrlandoMagic,3bgv8i,jive_turkey,3,Mon Jun 29 11:37:53 2015 UTC,"I think Boston over performed and might fall out of it too, but 2 teams down and 3 teams up still leaves us out of the hunt. If injuries take their toll on some teams we might fall backwards into it, but that doesn't feel like real progress and would cost us a lottery pick. I think they're still 9 teams in the east that should be better than us this year."
OrlandoMagic,3bgv8i,phagyna,9,Mon Jun 29 14:39:56 2015 UTC,Yes.  I thought this last season but the whole issue last year was our players didn't play as a team and couldn't finish at the end. Individually they all improved and played very well but our defensive schemes didn't work out and i'm assuming a known defensive coach in Skiles will be able to make our defensive guys really thrive in their play.
OrlandoMagic,3bgv8i,mjridiculouz,5,Mon Jun 29 02:52:58 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing last season too.  :/  I still have high hopes for next season though.
OrlandoMagic,3bgv8i,bizort,8,Mon Jun 29 02:56:37 2015 UTC,"I think it'll take another season. The entire team is still very young and now they have to take in a new coach who, I'd imagine, is quite different from Vaughn or Borrego. You'll inevitably have personality clashes with Skiles and he'll posture with others to limit their playing time until he gets them to play or practice the way he wants. That can produce some unpredictable results. Maybe Tobias doesn't practice hard enough and he gets benched for a few weeks? Once all of those kinks are worked out then I think you'll see improvement. That could take two months, half of a season, maybe the whole season. It's extremely difficult to project but, Orlando being so young, it will definitely occur.  The team will probably be able to sustain success for a longer amount of time if they're not rushed into attempting to compete for a useless 8th seed in the east, too. Be patient. Orlando is in great shape so enjoy the ride. No offense to Sixers fans but that is what a messy rebuild looks like. Orlando's has gone almost exactly according to plan at this point and we should really feel lucky and not want to rush it."
OrlandoMagic,3bgv8i,ninety4kid,3,Mon Jun 29 03:25:21 2015 UTC,Year 4 post Dwight era with significant improvement within our core its a possibility but not a necessity. I sure hope we do or make it damn near close.
OrlandoMagic,3bgv8i,UpvotesArePeople,3,Mon Jun 29 04:24:39 2015 UTC,"We might be in the hunt. Bringing in Elfrid was a big change last year, but I think Hezonja won't be as hard to successfully integrate with the the team. I think a lot of our core guys have good chemistry. With some solid coaching and game management, we could be in the hunt. We should keep getting better, but teams like Boston and Toronto haven't really made many roster improvements yet. We'll have a better idea once free agency gets started."
OrlandoMagic,3bgv8i,HakunaMatata023,3,Mon Jun 29 04:49:15 2015 UTC,"I still think this team isn't quite their yet however they do play in the very weak East Division so it is possible, I'd say wait and see how the FA period goes hopefully they'll get some depth."
OrlandoMagic,3bgv8i,RainbowSkull,3,Mon Jun 29 05:03:07 2015 UTC,"I'll say yes, because I want to believe.  All these young players getting better, with the help of a much better coach, should lead to a superior result."
OrlandoMagic,3bgv8i,onlysame1,3,Mon Jun 29 14:01:25 2015 UTC,"We would need to have an injury free season. We still don't have the depth we need to survive injuries. Unless we add additional players via free agency, I see us making a run for the 8th spot but barely missing it."
OrlandoMagic,3bgv8i,bk10287,3,Mon Jun 29 15:13:27 2015 UTC,"My expectations for this team are to be in the hunt for the playoffs.  In the East, that is not such a tall task.  I don't expect us to be in the playoffs, but I want to see us fighting for the 8th seed at the end of the season at the very least.  I think this year should be the year we make the jump from finishing in the bottom 5.  It's been 3 straight years, we have the talent, we just to realize all this potential we've acquired."
OrlandoMagic,3bgv8i,stevepwolf,4,Mon Jun 29 18:10:49 2015 UTC,"to make the playoffs, we'd need huge growth in payton and oladipo's outside shooting. i love both of them, but their lack of steady outside shooting kills our spacing.  we also need a big man to protect the rim"

OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,SuperBOOTH,8,Sun Jun 28 19:12:26 2015 UTC,Tobias is coming back. Hennigan said it himself earlier in the offseason. There's no reason to let him go only to overpay a worse player. And signing Tobias for $13-15M is a pretty good investment for a 23 year old who averaged 17 and 7 as a 3rd or 4th option.
OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,jive_turkey,-2,Sun Jun 28 20:12:30 2015 UTC,"I can see Tobias' offers escalating quickly... 3 Teams that need to win now in the Knicks, Lakers, and Celtics that all have been linked and interested. Detroit Pistons now in the fold now too. Tobias gets a bump in his endorsement contract too if he plays in a bigger market.  I could see the Magic matching an offer up to $15 Million a year, but I can't see it going North of $17 Million a year.  Tobias getting a 5 Year $85 Million deal might push it over and lead to a sign and trade. Nic Vucevic's extension has him making an average of $12 Million a year through 2018-2019.  This is just my opinion but I can't see the Magic paying Tobias $5 Million more a year than Nic.  I think Nic is a better basketball player personally and statistically it says so too. +2.2Pts, +5.3% FG%, +4.6Rebs, +0.2Ast,"
OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,NathanielSnack,12,Sun Jun 28 20:45:53 2015 UTC,The max that Tobias can get is $15 million man. He can't be given $17 million a year
OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,VictorOladeepthroat,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:02:49 2015 UTC,Yes. Lol. Match it we have nothing to lose
OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,REEB,7,Mon Jun 29 19:40:13 2015 UTC,"I'm 85% sure Tobias Harris will get an insane offer and the Magic will not match it.    His max is what, like $15 million? For a 22 year old with his skills, that is not insane at all with the increased cap coming very soon. Pretend the cap was not going to increase... would you give Harris a $10 million per year deal?    We won 25 games last season... I doubt subtracting Harris and replacing him with rookie Hezonja in the starting lineup will improve us next season. We really can't afford to let Harris go even if we see Hezonja as a big part of our future."
OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,CaptainBananaFish,5,Sun Jun 28 20:34:13 2015 UTC,I just can't get with any speculation prefaced by not keeping Tobias.  Can you explain why we wouldn't match?  Because the obvious/logical thing seems to be to keep him.
OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,Swalrus,-5,Sun Jun 28 19:42:29 2015 UTC,"My thing is I can see his Contract offers jumping through the roof quick. The Lakers, Knicks, and Celtics all need to win now and Lakers and Knicks have no trouble overspending. If Tobias gets in the $15 Million a year range that might be the cut line. I wouldn't be surprised to see him get a 5 Year $85 Million deal from one of those teams. Oh and apparently Detroit Pistons very interested too.   SO let's say a $17 Million a year deal comes across the table. Nikola Vucevic's extension has him making an average of $12 Million a year through 2018-2019.  I can't see the Orlando Magic paying Harris $5Million more a year than Nic. I think Nic is a better basketball player and stat sheet say Nic is better than Tobias. [Stats Nic over Tobias - +2.2Pts, +5.3% FG%, +4.6Rebs, +0.2Ast,]  If we can keep him for around $15 Million a year, Management shouldn't flinch... I can see a sign and trade happen though if it gets more North than that."
OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,greenskeeper87,3,Sun Jun 28 20:55:15 2015 UTC,"No one can offer Harris more money than us and that is based on the extra year we can offer. It is called a ""max"" deal because a player coming off a rookie contract cannot be given a new contract that amounts to more than 25% of the salary cap, which is $15 million a year."
OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,CaptainBananaFish,2,Sun Jun 28 21:44:38 2015 UTC,"Apparently you love to talk/type but not to read peoples responses to your previous posts. Someone already informed you that Tobias cannot be offered a 17 mil contract.   Now go make another post about how we shouldn't match a 17mil/year contract, amiright?"
OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,NathanielSnack,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:59:33 2015 UTC,"If Tobias gets in the $15 Million a year range that might be the cut line. I wouldn't be surprised to see him get a 5 Year $85 Million deal from one of those teams.   Well, they can't offer him a 5 year deal, only we can since we have his bird rights.  Also, I'm pretty sure his max is about $15mil.  It's not possible for him to make north of that because of the way max contracts work: they can only increase a certain amount based on your last contract.  Besides, the dude is still only 22!  He's only going to get better and we can afford to extend him and continue to develop him, not to mention have great depth with him and Mario.  Basically, offers can't jump through the roof for him.  Best anyone can offer is about 4/$60, we can give him 5/$75 if we wanted to."
OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,mjridiculouz,11,Sun Jun 28 23:07:02 2015 UTC,Again there's no chance we don't match Tobias. There's no way we aren't. Either we match him and if he doesn't work out we'll trade him later on down the while or we keep him and add to our depth. Even if he gets max once the new league cap goes into place his contract will be worth the equivalent of $10 million today. He's a good young talent. No reason for him to leave without us gaining value from it.
OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,ninety4kid,3,Sun Jun 28 20:08:48 2015 UTC,I rather keep Harris than sign Millsap for the fact that Harris already knows us and is a familiar face. If we want to be like SAS or OKC then we have to keep our core together and trust that they grow together.  Millsap is not a huge FA splash like Aldridge would be so I rather not do something like that  Mo Williams would probably prefer to play for a contender and will probably sign the vet min with CLE and reunite with LeBron. I still think that Jameer is an awesome fit here because I feel like when Jameer was with us he didn't really accept that vet role since he was starting for us but now after coming off the bench BOS and DEN I think he's finally accepted that vet role and would love to finish his career in Orlando  I don't care for Garcia as long as its a contract like Gordon where there is a team option in the 2nd year.
OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,Scottydoesntknowyou,2,Sun Jun 28 20:32:14 2015 UTC,"I hope we can re-sign KOQ on the low because he's exactly what we need as a physical defensive presence. Maybe under Skiles he can get consistent playing time. He's also a great passing big who shows good form on his shot but shouldn't continue heaving threes. His midrage is lethal and holds his own in the post. Or we can look for cheap similar options. I'm intrigued by bismack biyombo(?) He's an elite shot blocker that can potentially become ibaka lite, he doesn't look all to great on the other side of the ball though. T Rob is also a guy who can still reach his potential and is a great athlete. We could probably get him for cheap too."
OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,Gucciforlife,2,Sun Jun 28 19:32:20 2015 UTC,"I think everyones on the same page with Tobias.  We either extend contract, match offer or do a sign and trade with a team for another player (PF).  There are no other practical possibilites.  Besides that nice writeup"
OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,BroganTrundler,2,Sun Jun 28 20:15:39 2015 UTC,"There is 0% chance the magic let go Harris for nothing. To be ""85% sure he's (gone)"" is ridiculous and tells me OP either knows nothing about the magic, NBA free agency, the NBA in general, or all of the above."
OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,mufcreddevil7,3,Sun Jun 28 22:32:06 2015 UTC,Bring back Jameer!
OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,subutaime,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:20:27 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see Nelson & Garcia. Would solve problems with experience/leadership, as well as offer some defensive workers & some decent shooters. Those guys would come cheap & would go a long way toward helping us build a contender. Sign them up!"
OrlandoMagic,3bff5m,HakunaMatata023,0,Tue Jun 30 13:47:40 2015 UTC,"I don't see us matching anything above 12 per for Harris. I love MO Williams for us, great call."

OrlandoMagic,3bfofh,subutaime,3,Mon Jun 29 00:26:09 2015 UTC,"It was great. It wasn't exactly the cultural shock that you would expect a 17 year old who has never been away from Florida to get but I had a blast there and just being able to hang out with the kids there and help the Bible College we were staying at and all that stuff was awesome. Only negative was that out of the 10 days I was there, there was one day that was filled with relationship drama which distracted me that day but it's all worked out and it was just awesome to become family with the other 20ish people I went it. I will definitely go back if I get the opportunity"
OrlandoMagic,3bfofh,VictorOladeepthroat,2,Mon Jun 29 13:54:06 2015 UTC,That's great man its always a good thing to make new friends and experience new things. The more people and experiences u add to ur life the better life will be.

I am new to Reddit and the Magic thread, but happy to see fellow Magic fans with a heart for the rest of the world. I bet you were surprised to see Hezonja haha"
OrlandoMagic,3bfofh,maddog00,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:29:42 2015 UTC,I like Tobias a lot.  But I'm still not convinced he is a max type player.  His defense isn't great and he seems to be somewhat of a tweener.  To small for PF and too bulky to cover the quicker SFs out on the perimeter.   It's not like he is a lights out scorer either.  He's very good.  But not great.
OrlandoMagic,3bfofh,matty_hawk,6,Sun Jun 28 22:34:49 2015 UTC,"Define ""lights out scorer""? Wasn't he 37% from 3? I don't know his exact value, but anyone who can create for himself, shoot 3s, rebound and play multiple roles, deserves a decent amount of respect, especially at his age."
OrlandoMagic,3bfofh,ninety4kid,2,Sun Jun 28 23:07:36 2015 UTC,He was close to automatic from one of the corners forget if it's left or right side but the drive and kick that him and Oladipo have developed is one of my favorite plays.
OrlandoMagic,3bfofh,Reservoircats,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:26:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I don't think harris is anywhere near max money, but I keep forgetting that the dude is only 22. It would suck to see him flourish elsewhere. At the same time we already have all the youth in the world. I think were 1-2 veterans away from being a playoff team in the east. Precisely a veteran power forward."
OrlandoMagic,3bd5ja,rtillaree,6,Sun Jun 28 02:28:35 2015 UTC,"Was kinda excited for him to reunite with Skiles, but maybe the money can be better spent elsewhere."
OrlandoMagic,3bd5ja,UpvotesArePeople,7,Sun Jun 28 06:15:41 2015 UTC,"Gives us about $14.5m in cap. Not sure what will happen with Green, Marble and Dedmon but that's decent coin."
OrlandoMagic,3bd5ja,EyeoftheTyga,5,Sun Jun 28 02:33:56 2015 UTC,Marble and Dedmon are staying
OrlandoMagic,3bd5ja,thug_life4,4,Sun Jun 28 02:35:50 2015 UTC,"If it fits Rob's plan. I'm pretty confident on Dedmon but, we'll see."
OrlandoMagic,3bd5ja,Ellimistopher,4,Sun Jun 28 02:37:35 2015 UTC,both will play in the summer league. pretty confident dedmon will be on the roster next year. don't sees any way both Marble and Harvey are on the active roster come week 1. both will likely be in/out of d league and only time both would be on active roster at once is because of injuries
OrlandoMagic,3bd5ja,bk10287,2,Sun Jun 28 03:06:25 2015 UTC,Dedmon was by far our most consistent option off the bench all year long.
OrlandoMagic,3bd5ja,REEB,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:26:34 2015 UTC,"It would be stupid of us not to keep the guy.  He works insanely hard, has a great attitude, and is in his early 20's.  And he is an athletic gold mine"
OrlandoMagic,3bd5ja,Mattty_boi,3,Mon Jun 29 18:12:10 2015 UTC,Willie's deal was only a year (no 2nd year option or anything). I'd be shocked if hennigan re-signed him.
OrlandoMagic,3bd5ja,bizort,3,Sun Jun 28 03:06:44 2015 UTC,Isn't Green and Unrestricted free agent? And this just clears space for us giving Tobias 13m...
OrlandoMagic,3bd5ja,ninety4kid,2,Sun Jun 28 03:07:34 2015 UTC,"That's right, for some reason I was thinking it was a 2/$3m deal with the 2nd being team. In that case, Dedmon and Marble with Dedmon most likely coming back due to those advanced stats spiking the last half of the season."
OrlandoMagic,3bd5ja,Ellimistopher,2,Sun Jun 28 03:19:19 2015 UTC,Dedmon improved dramatically as the season went on. He was legitimately one of the worst players in the league that I'd seen when he was signed. I really hope he comes back.
OrlandoMagic,3bd5ja,ninety4kid,9,Sun Jun 28 14:26:03 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate the time and dedication that bg, Willie and Ridenour did for this team. We could've been way worse had those guys not been the veteran voices helping the struggling team. I have a feeling they did more coaching than Vaughn did. They taught the ins and outs of the league to our young core and they supported them 100%. I believe had we no veterans on the team we'd have a bigger mess on our hands. Now under coach Skiles we have a competent coach who holds players accountable, something Vaughn didn't do but I'm pretty sure those three did."
OrlandoMagic,3bd5ja,Ellimistopher,2,Sun Jun 28 09:55:19 2015 UTC,"There is a reason why the team had the exact same roster all year long. No roster turnover, no drama."
OrlandoMagic,3bd5ja,pnp_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:25:45 2015 UTC,Yup yup and that so called cancer that everyone thought bg would've been didn't even occur within our team.
