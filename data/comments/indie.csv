Only if because going from Strawberry Jams (my personal favorite) to MPP was such a fun ride, and its this willingness to explore that makes their music worthwhile.

indie,3deppj,GoodsAtx,3,Wed Jul 15 18:13:19 2015 UTC,"""Indie"" means very different things connotatively and denotatively. ""Indie"" as a music genre is no longer tied to the popularity or signing status of a band, but just an indicator to let someone know it's style is evocative of the sound of the independent rock and pop music of the 90's and 00's. Cultural movements come first, and then are followed by their labels. Those labels are tied to the spirit or ethos of the time, and are not updated year after year. James Joyce isn't any less of a modernist because he wrote 100 years ago.  Short answer, though, yeah you would probably just call it rock or pop. But, what is pop?"

Also, Twin Shadow is fun, and has kind of an 80s sound, but I wish the lead singer would play more to his vocal strengths are really start belting it out rather than accenting the music with his voice.

His studio recordings are good but his live stuff is so much better, he plays this drum -- I don't even know it just does something to you. I'll stop getting all hippy-dippy about it, here's a live session version of one of his more popular songs, Corvette Cassette."

indie,3cu2e4,all3gra,4,Fri Jul 10 19:52:53 2015 UTC,"Everything by BØRNS will make you happy. 10,000 Emerald Pools instantly calms me"
indie,3cu2e4,mrjfray,4,Fri Jul 10 20:55:24 2015 UTC,BORNS just has a way at diving right into you and finding a feeling you didn't know you were without.
indie,3cu2e4,wja369,3,Fri Jul 10 21:16:34 2015 UTC,"First heard this guy with ""Seeing Stars,"" love his sound. I also second the recommendation to check out his other stuff guys, it's good. Shame he's only got one EP"
indie,3cu2e4,aydiosmio_eseldiablo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:14:47 2015 UTC,Right? I want more. Like...a lot more.
indie,3cu2e4,Maridiem,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:13:57 2015 UTC,That intro part of this song is just amazing.
indie,3cu2e4,eggyblonde,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:54:37 2015 UTC,Man this song is so good. First had it recommended to me and I could only find a live version online and this guy kills it.
indie,3cu2e4,freee,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:44:57 2015 UTC,awesome band!
indie,3cqkxa,cultculturee,8,Thu Jul 9 23:53:54 2015 UTC,"I wasn't a huge fan of Reflektor by itself, but for whatever reason this music video really made the album for me and I was really sad when they took it down. For whatever reason I wasn't getting any hits on google over the past couple years but randomly today I found a link to a guy on vimeo who had ripped it and added sound later. Hopefully someone similar out there has been looking for this."
indie,3cqkxa,guitarcat,2,Thu Jul 9 23:57:33 2015 UTC,"Is this some movie or did the band actually make this thing? I liked the album when it came out, and the video is similar to the Afterlife video that came out"
indie,3cqkxa,Manateeforme,2,Fri Jul 10 02:59:48 2015 UTC,r did the band actually make this thing? I lik   It's a movie. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Orpheus I'd highly recommend checking it out.
indie,3cqkxa,evanisonreddit,2,Fri Jul 10 03:24:06 2015 UTC,"The movie is called Black Orpheus and was made in 1959 in Brazil by french director Marcel Camus, and was edited to coincide with the album and released by Arcade Fire's official youtube channel the day Reflektor released, until it was taken down a couple days later for whatever reason.  The interactive music video for Reflektor is also very similar, I really enjoy the aesthetic overall as well."
indie,3cqkxa,guitarcat,2,Fri Jul 10 03:27:13 2015 UTC,wonder if maybe they didn't originally get the rights to it?
indie,3cqkxa,Cddd23,2,Fri Jul 10 06:40:48 2015 UTC,"oo good point, sounds plausible"
