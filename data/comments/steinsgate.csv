steinsgate,3e17xs,waicool20,5,Tue Jul 21 04:19:43 2015 UTC,"People usually say the difference between fooling around and science is writing results down.    That reference is so damn slick.  Anyways, I respect all the work you're putting into this project. I'd love to have a Divergence Meter myself, but with limited time and technical skills, buying is probably the only option sometimes in the future.  Now, with my limited technical knowledge, I'll ask a stupid question: aren't there better batteries you could put in there that live longer? 11,5 hours aren't much, they may as well run out of energy over night..  Maybe a direct, constant energy supply with a cord would do the trick too?"
steinsgate,3e17xs,JedWasTaken,3,Tue Jul 21 09:44:25 2015 UTC,"I have included a DC jack that can be used to power the meter when stationary, other batteries are either too low of a voltage or are too big. Though one thing to note is that even when it runs out of power it still keeps time because the time keeping uses a different power supply"
steinsgate,3e17xs,JedWasTaken,2,Tue Jul 21 11:40:43 2015 UTC,"Well, it's something I guess? I wouldn't even dare move it too much, as to not break the tubes, so I myself wouldn't mind the stationary setup.   Bigger batteries would require a different frame, that would possibly alter the overall look of it, right?"

steinsgate,3duvhm,choconthemind,10,Sun Jul 19 18:28:29 2015 UTC,"On the PS3, the controller vibrates for phonecalls/messages/some story events."
steinsgate,3duvhm,bugworkaround,3,Sun Jul 19 22:39:36 2015 UTC,"The phone trigger system is the only thing that comes to mind as being an issue. The game's decision points often come as phone calls or text messages that you have to answer to progress. There's a visual cue for them, but it's not in the text box where you'll usually be reading, and it's sometimes difficult to notice. The rest of the game is very accessible, as it's basically entirely text-based.  Edit: Alright, after spending some time with the game to chec a few things, here's what you'll need to be wary of:  While text messages from characters have a distinct visual cue (""New Mail"" in the date window), phone calls pretty much only use sound to let you know they're happening. However, there are some things you can do about this: like real phones, you can change the ringtone of the one in Steins;Gate to one that might be easier to hear. Additionally, text will not advance when getting a phone call if you're in auto mode, so setting the game to auto mode will help. Picking up the phone/answering a text requires simply pressing the answer button on your controller (idk what it is on the Ps3, but it's square on the Vita and the P key on PC) anytime after the phone call happens. Advancing the text three times skips the call, so you have until then to pick up."
steinsgate,3duvhm,Fun_Titan,2,Sun Jul 19 18:51:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Can you tell me more about the phone trigger system? Like how it works and how loud is it? I do have some hearing with hearing aids but I sometimes find it difficult to distinguish noises especially if there's music or background noise. I'm trying not to spoil myself so I'm avoiding videos and such. Also, would you say it's worth the $40? I don't usually buy games brand new."

steinsgate,3duvhm,KarboniteKream,2,Mon Jul 20 03:19:01 2015 UTC,"As /u/Davixxa mentioned, the phone trigger system flashes blue when you receive a mail (if you happen to miss a mail, you will have an email icon near the date).  Also, the text on PS3 is bigger compared to PC, so that shouldn't be an issue on a 32-inch TV. Here's an example without spoilers."
steinsgate,3duvhm,KarboniteKream,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:38:26 2015 UTC,Thanks. I did decide to look up the phone trigger system and it seems to be important that I respond quickly so I'm wondering how much time I have to respond if it's for an important part and how bad it is if I miss it.
steinsgate,3duvhm,Davixxa,2,Sun Jul 19 20:49:53 2015 UTC,"The ones that are necessary for the story to progress will open automatically if you do not open them yourself.  As for the other ones, I think that you have to skip three screens of text (I may be wrong on this one) in order to stop the blue flashing, but you can respond to them any time you want.  You can bring up the phone and answer to mails any time you want, even during conversation. In my experience, you should't need to worry about not seeing the mail arrive or failing to answer in time."
steinsgate,3duvhm,Davixxa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:02:47 2015 UTC,Some parts iirc won't let you continue without responding

Otherwise, Steins;Gate is just a smaller piece of a broader series known as Science Adventure. I would highly suggest checking out Chaos;Head and Robotics;Notes. But you must not watch the Chaos;Head anime, it is a ridiculously terrible adaptation. If you're going to look into Chaos;Head, only read the VN. As for Robotics;Notes, the VN is untranslated so the anime is your only avenue. It falls a little flat about midway due to not being a great adaptation, but it's still acceptable."

Also about C;H and R;N , i believe i started the latter as an anime but dropped it due to being too slow or something like that. I'm too lazy to read VNs since im practically a gamer. I actually I only started the S;G VN since I read somewhere it was a game (which kind of is) and know the name from somewhere else. Thanks anyway for the reply :D"
steinsgate,3dtksy,TheSonu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:05:31 2015 UTC,"Well if you have the patience for the mangas, try to find a way to go forward with the VN.  It isn't really the ""game"" you were looking for, but the novel has a lot of interesting things the anime doesn't cover.  It's really amazing, and Suzuha's ending is the earliest cutoff in the game, so you still have a ton of content to go through.  I'd say give it another shot! There's an 8-bit text based game and a few other spin-off VNs, but I don't know if they would be up your alley."
steinsgate,3dtksy,brothertaddeus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:10:25 2015 UTC,"Well it's gonna be hard to convince myself to give the VN another shot, cos it took me like 22 hrs for Suzuha's ending and I'm currently more into CS:GO right now (mostly watching on twitch), but if anything I could try the spin-offs.

steinsgate,3dryb5,makisekuritorisu,7,Sat Jul 18 21:50:04 2015 UTC,"I Suggest:  Steins;Gate (VN/Anime), OVA & Movie (Non Canon but enjoyable), Soumei Eichi no Cognitive Computing.  Then go for Zakobot's 2 Spin-off VNs translations Here first i suggest Hiyoku Renri no Darling because it's already fully translated and it's a real spin-off some Canonic info, but nothing that happens in that VN is Canon, it's very funny and sometime can make you cry with the romance stories... then watch Linear Bounded Phenogram, for now there are 38 episodes translated, at the moment Zakobot is translating the last route (the secret one), the VN explains the stories of the other characters from their point of view, it's very interesting to watch.  For the mangas i suggest to read before: Boukan no Rebellion (Rebellion of the Missing Ring), the story view by Suzuha point of view with her story fully explained, then go for Onshuu no Brownian Motion (Braunian Motion of Love and Hate) Mr. Braun's manga that begins after the end of Suzuha's one, so you can read the both of the Epigraph Trilogy manga (for now i've missed to read them because i want them to finish before).  For the Canonic Drama CDs you can watch them when you want, you just need to have played the VN or watched the Anime, btw Drama CD Gamma Alpha is located when Okabe have to cancel the first D-Mail, and talks about Kurisu & Rumiho (Faris Nyan Nyan), the Drama CD Beta is located on Beta Worldine when Okabe stabs Kurisu, and is on Mayuri, Suzuha, the WW3 and the future, Drama CD Gamma is located when Okabe cancels Luka's D-Mail and he gets in a Dark world where he is a Rounder with Moeka... (for the third search on Tempus Edax Rerum for the Animated one, the others two you can find the normal image version on the link below, JD2390's YT channel)  The other Spin-offs Drama CDs that you can watch are spin-offs that can be watched when you want you can find many of them here: JD2390's channel  Hope i've helped you, enjoy your Steins;Gate's experience!"

You probably noticed already how many details the anime left out, since you're playing the VN. It should be played before anything else, since it's the main story.   Hen'i Kuukan no Octet is non-canon and more of a comedy, watch whenever you feel like it. But the basic story should be known beforehand, or else its kinda silly.  Hiyoku Renri no Darling falls under the same category; probably non-canon and definitely not relevant for a full order watch.  Senkei Kousoku no Phenogram is probably the only other VN that is relevant, personally I would play it after the original anime/VN, since it shows the main story from the perspectives of Okabe's crew.     Edit.: I can't give you any info on Drama CD's though, I never got to experience them."

steinsgate,3dslwi,gennciiq,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:24:40 2015 UTC,"Well it also depends on how fast you read, so it took me around 22 hrs to get Suzuha's ending, which is the shortest ending of them all.I'm kind of a slow reader but I read somewhere that some endings go to 40+ hrs."
steinsgate,3dslwi,VicisSubsisto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:15:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but most endings require little backtracking if you save at the right points. Getting Mayuri's ending and the true ending are the only two that require changing more than one decision.  Also while I haven't played Fate, I hear it's over 100 hours long. So, still shorter."

The first two books have a translated manga adaptation in batoto  they deal with a world in which kyouma gives up on saving Kurisu. He has ptsd over her death. But eventually he becomes the kyouma that sends a video dmail to encourage our kyouma to save her and reach steins;gate  http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/steinsgate-heijikyokusen-no-epigraph-r8585  http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/steinsgate-eigou-kaiki-no-pandora-r10109

As to it's meaning, my guess is that that it's a visual metaphor. Being that when man accumulates too much knowledge about the world/universe, it inevitably becomes his downfall. Hence man figuring out time travel would lead to his death.  This is a pretty common theme in a lot of religious followings and is even referred to in some text that often appears next to the Steins;Gate logo.  ""There is no end though there is a start in space. — Infinity. It has (its) own power, it ruins, and it goes though there is a start also in the star. — Finite. Only the person who (has) wisdom can read the most foolish one from the history. The fish that lives in the sea doesn't know the world in the land. It also ruins and goes if they have wisdom. It is funnier that man exceeds the speed of light than fish start living in the land. It can be said that this is (a) final ultimatum from the god to the people who can fight.""  Hope that helps."

steinsgate,3dgfa5,Bahamut92,2,Thu Jul 16 12:08:10 2015 UTC,[23/24 SPOILERS]  just in case~  I also loved that the VN made both of the stabbing scenes more fucked up. The first one really hurt to read through. And when in the second one Okabe told Nakabachi what he planned to do to Kurisu.. That was so damn creepy and wrong and amazing. Also calling his blood puddle a masterpiece was a very fitting comment from a mad scientist :)

steinsgate,3detrp,Chin2112,9,Wed Jul 15 18:41:13 2015 UTC,I'd recommend watching Code Geass. Not that it has anything in common with S;G but it's just a very good emotional rollercoaster.  If you're looking for good psychological thrillers (which is big part of S;G's charm for me at least) then check out Paranoia Agent and Monster. Just be aware that Monster starts off extremely slow but it's totally worth it.  If the supernatural and goofy part of S;G is what you're looking for then The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi is sort of similar.  Oh and please watch anime with japanese audio. The acting is so much better.
steinsgate,3detrp,Shaedana,2,Wed Jul 15 19:21:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you, i'll give one of them a go now!  The only reason I prefer dubs is that I watch a lot of anime while on the move, on journeys and also while at work. This means it's harder for me to completely concentrate on reading the subs.  I also chose Steins;Gate as a lot of people preferred the dubbed version, I had no real idea of the emotional and psychological rollercoaster I was going to fall into.  I would never discount watching subs, it's just in my case, it's a lot better for my circumstances."

steinsgate,3detrp,Maledicte,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:23:17 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'd disagree. Anime is *usually* better subbed, but in some cases, notably Steins;Gate, Cowboy Bebop, etc, the dub is just phenomenal. It's worth watching both if you're so inclined, but to just discount dubs entirely is just a little silly, and I say that as a dude who prefers the sub most of the time."
steinsgate,3detrp,Jeffery2084,3,Sat Jul 18 18:31:13 2015 UTC,"Cowboy BeBop has a very good dub, and is kind of a required amine. Also, it is an amine that is complete, whereas some don't end, and never get second seasons.  I also just finished Code Geass, and it is very good, with a pretty good dub. I would also recommend Baccano. In fact I would probably recommend Baccano next.  It also has a very good dub. Baccano is also a bit shorter than code Geass.

Therefore they formed a link between themselves and Daru's computer so they could monitor what he was doing. As a side effect it also allowed the Future gadget lab to access the LHC (we don't know if it was intentional or not).

steinsgate,3dccdg,Shaedana,4,Wed Jul 15 04:03:19 2015 UTC,"I had began with the Anime, first time I believed that Okarin was saying serious things, then I got it when Kurisu saw that the cellphone was off, then the first episode didn't get me so much, in fact I've watched just one before go bed and then stopped, the next day I've tried watching the second and I loved how the Anime leaves a cliffhanger at the end of the episodes that catched my interest... and now I'm here, I've watched the Anime for 7 times, and saw almost all the side material and bought the European El Psy Kongroo Edition VN, and the Anime's BDs. :P  (Sorry for my bad English xD)"
steinsgate,3dccdg,Bahamut92,3,Wed Jul 15 10:27:29 2015 UTC,"Then John Titor was mentioned in S;G I though to myself: ""This is going to be good!"" I wasn't wrong."
steinsgate,3dccdg,Exormeter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:52:22 2015 UTC,same here. :D
steinsgate,3dccdg,Bahamut92,3,Wed Jul 15 17:33:22 2015 UTC,"At the beginning of the anime I was really intrigued. I got hooked because I saw Kurisu and Okabe kissing on some forum so I started to watch the anime to know what it's all about and ended up confused when I saw that Kurisu seemingly died in the first episode.   Got hooked and continued watching, regret nothing. One of the best anime I've ever seen."
steinsgate,3dccdg,lightfive,2,Wed Jul 15 17:13:51 2015 UTC,"I was left curious by the amount of odd stuff that happened at the beginning, I went into it knowing literally zero about it, even that it was any good. I started off really disliking Okabe, I had a low tolerance for his BS like fake phone calls when somebody starts talking to him.  The mystery of what on earth was going on kept me going and eventually the exceptional development of Okabe changed him from wosrt to best character in my eyes and that is part of why I think it's so great."
steinsgate,3dccdg,Alazais86,2,Wed Jul 15 09:10:17 2015 UTC,"I find it fascinating when people say they disliked Okabe at first. I'm not judging you or anything but it just never occurred to me someone might think he's annoying. Maybe that just proves how much I appreciated the writing, his act felt natural to me. Usually in other series I have a very low tolerance to BS.  I wonder if anime first -audience is more easily annoyed by Okabe? Since I went in VN first I was pretty much just screaming ""Have my babies Mamoru Miyano!!!"" when I started the anime :P"
steinsgate,3dccdg,Bahamut92,3,Wed Jul 15 12:25:41 2015 UTC,Mamoru Miyano can have my babies when he wants after the work he had done with Okabe's dub. :P
steinsgate,3dccdg,Bahamut92,2,Wed Jul 15 21:43:26 2015 UTC,Yeah I wasn't a big fan of his before S;G. I always thought he had some good moments but for most part his roles just sounded off. I guess his balancing act between goofy and megalomaniac just hadn't hit the right spot. Somehow he pulled Okabe off almost perfectly.
steinsgate,3dccdg,HitodamaKyrie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:48:55 2015 UTC,"I loved how he acted as Light Yagami in Death Note, simply amazing, then when i heard his voice for Okabe role... I was like ""Dis Gon B Gud!"". :P"
steinsgate,3dccdg,brothertaddeus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:59:23 2015 UTC,I watched the anime first and I never felt any annoyance to Okabe. I don't really understand when people feel that either.
steinsgate,3dccdg,Chin2112,2,Wed Jul 15 23:17:27 2015 UTC,"I started with the anime, and honestly loved every second of it from the get-go. Sure, Okabe was a bit of a ""chuundere"" (see what I did there?), but that's my kind of crazy. However, after reading this thread in /r/anime I got the impression that many, many people did not enjoy the beginning, either the plot or the random antics. Every other comment is about Steins;Gate.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm glad for this here thread. I also wondered if Mayuri was an imaginary friend (or worse, an Organization operative!). But Steins;Gate was my first anime and first visual novel. No ragrets."
steinsgate,3dccdg,123dragame,2,Wed Jul 15 15:17:19 2015 UTC,I'm really thankful for /r/anime and /r/games though. If S;G wasn't always brought up in these sorts of threads I never would've cared to buy the VN. I kept hearing so much praise for the series I was confident enough to buy the El Psy Kongroo edition the moment I heard about it even though I knew nothing about the game.
steinsgate,3dccdg,Ankasammy,2,Wed Jul 15 16:38:50 2015 UTC,I remember at the end of the first episode being completely confused but feeling like I had to watch episode two straight away. I was hooked straight away.

steinsgate,3d7j10,sbima,12,Tue Jul 14 03:10:33 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd say both. If I HAD to pick just one, I'd pick the VN because of the extra content, it's pretty much 40 hours of VN and 8 hours of anime. I watched the anime first and loved it, then played the VN and it just added to an already great world. I've seen some people say they were disappointed in the anime because they played the VN first so I'd suggest anime first if you're willing to do both."
steinsgate,3d7j10,Alazais86,5,Tue Jul 14 04:24:46 2015 UTC,"They're both great. The anime is like a roller coaster with everything happening pretty quickly, while the VN is like a grand adventure full of learning and excitement, but with it's own share of downtime.  I myself watched the anime first, as it was much more readily available then. (You had to do shenanigans to play the VN then.) I was still able to enjoy the VN greatly afterwards, so I can say that approach does seem to work.  The anime probably would feel like an abridged version of the VN, so you can imagine that playing the VN after the anime feels like getting extra content while watching the anime after the VN would feel like they took out a lot of important scenes.  The real downside to the anime first would simply be the true end spoilers, but getting the true end in the VN is pretty hard already. Getting best girl's ending first is good in my book, so the anime is good for that too."
steinsgate,3d7j10,HitodamaKyrie,10,Tue Jul 14 07:08:00 2015 UTC,"If you don't prefer one or the other in general, the visual novel is much more in depth and has elements of choice and interaction.  However, I preferred the anime much more because I prefer the anime experience with characters moving around and with me just sitting down and watching. I also slightly prefer the art in the anime to the art in the VN.  Mostly it comes down to personal choice, but the VN has objectively more content."
steinsgate,3d7j10,MrWolf5000,2,Tue Jul 14 03:35:38 2015 UTC,I prefer the VN because some of the story twists and emotional moments are just too rushed in the anime to properly sink in.  I have now recently gone through VN->anime->VN again. Okabe's internal commentary alone makes the VN much more interesting experience. Also I really liked the fake endings. They were surprisingly touching and thought provoking.
steinsgate,3d7j10,Shaedana,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:17:27 2015 UTC,"I started with the Anime and I loved it, then i discover that it was adapted from a VN and enjoyed it much than the Anime (that is great anyways), so i recommend the VN because has more content than the Anime, but if you can watch both of them because they're equally great. :)"
steinsgate,3d7j10,Bahamut92,0,Tue Jul 14 10:28:01 2015 UTC,"Play the VN first, then follow up with the anime. The VN has the full story, and then after you're done you can enjoy watching key scenes in animated form."
steinsgate,3d7j10,Blitzschnelle,2,Tue Jul 14 11:55:07 2015 UTC,"I'd actually suggest against that. VN has a lot of extra content, which you'll notice are missing in the anime. If you watch the anime first and play the VN later, VN will have the novelty factor. The same is not true vice versa."
steinsgate,3d7p6n,BobTheLawyer,8,Tue Jul 14 04:02:58 2015 UTC,"The story content is the same in all versions, but there are slight differences in presentation (PS3 version has higher resolution than PC, Vita is portable, console versions have a faster skip function and the backlog feature shows the character names, but there are some word wrapping glitches).  It's worth noting that the other VNs in the series (and thus any future localizations) are not on PC, so it might be a good investment to get one of these consoles. If you're on a budget, PlayStation TV supports a large number of Vita games (including all Science Adventure VNs)."
steinsgate,3d0tvg,HitodamaKyrie,14,Sun Jul 12 15:58:08 2015 UTC,"Well, it's diet what do you expect?  Nice capture though"
steinsgate,3d0tvg,lightfive,6,Sun Jul 12 17:56:15 2015 UTC,"Ahem. Okabe seems interested.  You are right that it is inferior to the mastery that is True Dr.Pepper, but it has it's uses nonetheless."
steinsgate,3d0tvg,makisekuritorisu,6,Sun Jul 12 19:58:49 2015 UTC,"Hah, came here to say this.  Diet Pepper is awful. I mean it's awesome but it's awful compared to normal Pepper. Which is slightly better than Cherry Pepper."
steinsgate,3d0tvg,lightfive,6,Sun Jul 12 18:05:17 2015 UTC,I never understood the appeal of Cherry Pepper. Is it just me or does the regular Dr.Pepper taste like cherry already?
steinsgate,3d0tvg,makisekuritorisu,9,Sun Jul 12 18:22:08 2015 UTC,"It does. Cherry Pepper just tastes more ""cherry"".  And it's color is different, more purple."
steinsgate,3d0tvg,makisekuritorisu,3,Sun Jul 12 18:34:47 2015 UTC,"They say Dr.Pepper is cherry flavored, and I really like Dr.Pepper. However, I do not like cherries or cherry flavored things. Something seems off..."
steinsgate,3d0tvg,Davixxa,3,Sun Jul 12 19:55:59 2015 UTC,"No, everything's alright. Dr Pepper is just too wonderful."
steinsgate,3d1q7z,Jazzem_,6,Sun Jul 12 20:28:23 2015 UTC,"I played the VN before watching the anime. It's a good piece of supplementary material and it's definitely good to see certain parts animated, note that they do make a rather large change to events in Chapter 9 that I personally think detracts from the overall story. But that's just an issue of adaptation decay. Also Shido/Sid/4C is absent from the anime due to the show only dedicating one episode to the Faris and Luka arcs respectively.  Overall by adaptation standards it's certainly good, just not on the same level as the VN. But that's to be expected, it was made for people who had played the VN to enjoy seeing key parts animated, after all."
steinsgate,3d1q7z,Blitzschnelle,3,Sun Jul 12 20:34:20 2015 UTC,"Well the anime goes out of its way to make the first half captivating. Quick cuts, fast dialogue, etc.   I'll probably get hate for this, but the VN's not that good in its first half. That said, the anime does leave a good chunk of important things out, like the infamous Nae scene.  It's also a touch more atmospheric, in my humble opinion.  Yes, it's good."
steinsgate,3d1q7z,soberwalrus,2,Mon Jul 13 00:52:31 2015 UTC,I was in the exact same situation few days ago.  Yes the anime is definitely worth it. I especially loved Mamoru Miyano doing an unbelievably amazing performance as Okabe. He sounds much more mature although I do miss his broken laughters from the later parts of the VN.  There were a lot of rushed scenes that left me disappointed but overall I do recommend the anime. I might be in the minority when it comes to the OVA and movie though. Those seemed like poorly written fanfics in comparison and I couldn't watch them to the end.
steinsgate,3d1q7z,Shaedana,5,Sun Jul 12 21:20:51 2015 UTC,"The OVA and Movie were not penned by the original authors and are not regarded as canon, thankfully."
steinsgate,3d1q7z,Blitzschnelle,2,Sun Jul 12 21:56:15 2015 UTC,Really? That's dissapointing...
steinsgate,3d1q7z,AlexTheRedditor97,2,Tue Jul 14 05:41:15 2015 UTC,"Whats the difference between the game now and the one coming out next month? They look the same to me. I know one is NA and others have been EU, but I haven't been able to find any difference between the two. I really want to play it on my vita."
steinsgate,3d1q7z,SIRTreehugger,2,Sun Jul 12 23:19:58 2015 UTC,Are you perhaps confusing that PQube is releasing Steins;Gate on PS3 and Vita with the announcement of Steins;Gate Zero?  The PQube release is the original game. There's no differences to the game now. Steins;Gate Zero is the upcoming mobius-sequel. You'll likely have to wait an unfortunate amount of time to play that one.
steinsgate,3d1q7z,HitodamaKyrie,2,Mon Jul 13 00:55:56 2015 UTC,No NA is getting Steins;Gate for PS3 and Vita on August 25. It's not Gate Zero. That's why I was wondering if there was any real difference between the EU and NA version.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZvoTgF1TCs
steinsgate,3d1q7z,SIRTreehugger,2,Mon Jul 13 01:38:06 2015 UTC,"Indeed. As I said though, there isn't any difference afaik. The EU version already used the translation from the NA PC-release."
steinsgate,3d1q7z,HitodamaKyrie,3,Mon Jul 13 01:59:50 2015 UTC,"Good then I  can just buy it now then, thank you."
steinsgate,3d1b64,Shaedana,7,Sun Jul 12 18:26:04 2015 UTC,"In Japanese culture, ""God"" as it's referred to in Steins;Gate is synonymous with fate and forces beyond one's control. When Okabe curses God it's more that he curses his own powerlessness.  That said, Epigraph does contain some religious elements. There is a religious fanatic that doesn't believe creating Artificial Intelligence is ethical, and the story explores all sides of that debate."
steinsgate,3d1b64,Blitzschnelle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:46:40 2015 UTC,"Is that so? It'd seem pretty odd to combine God and fate together since Okabe at one point considers either of them as the target of his prayers. Also in the beginning Okabe mentions God giving a warning to humanity. Even if you don't consider the quote in the literal meaning, ""fate"" wouldn't really work in that context."
steinsgate,3d1b64,Blitzschnelle,2,Sun Jul 12 21:04:52 2015 UTC,"There are a certain few instances in Steins;Gate in which he directly appeals to God or a higher power, but the frequent usage of the term (神), it simply refers to a force beyond one's comprehension and control, like fate. It can mean a higher being, but it doesn't specifically mean ""God"" in the traditional western sense."
steinsgate,3d1b64,HitodamaKyrie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:08:11 2015 UTC,"Is that the kanji for ""kami""? Because in every mention of any sort of godhood kami is what I remember hearing about. I'm curious what other words are there or is it a difference in kanji?"
steinsgate,3d1b64,HitodamaKyrie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:16:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, 神 is kami. I'm not sure what you mean by other words though. I'd say the mentionings of a god are mostly used in a romantic sense. They simply refer to the human concept of transcendent forces."
steinsgate,3d1b64,Tyrfing42,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:11:24 2015 UTC,To me it sounded like /u/Blitzschnelle was making a linguistic argument but if the same word is used in every religious context why would he/she be so certain of its meaning in S;G?  The lyrics of Skyclad Observer are written by one of the writers of the VN and they mention the world being a creation of God. I do think such lyrics are very unusual for a japanese game/anime. But there's no doubt that religious themes are being brought up here and it's up to the audience how much weight to put on them.
steinsgate,3d1b64,Tyrfing42,2,Mon Jul 13 07:20:44 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of the lyric. I'd say what /u/Blitzschnelle was trying to say is that the Japanese really don't put any weight on the word kami, like westerners often do on the word god.  As I said, god is being used in a more romantic sense. Like the concept of pantheism. Fate is part of that. The unstoppable billion year old methodical churning of the universe that would sweep whole civilizations away without pause.  That said, you're free to take the words at whatever value you want. Just saying that religion isn't really an issue in Japan. There's no pressure to attack and disprove something that doesn't matter in the end."

steinsgate,3d08qt,Sh4d0wm0r3,2,Mon Jul 13 15:34:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, I enjoyed it. Anything with more Kurisu x Okabe is ok in my book. But I enjoyed it the same way I enjoy fan fiction."
steinsgate,3d08qt,JedWasTaken,3,Mon Jul 13 15:39:10 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, I think the same way but I thought the movie was almost better directed than the series in some ways and it really played with my mind a few times (I didn't see that change of perspective coming) and when your fav character is Kurisu, you just simply can't hate this movie :D"

steinsgate,3czdsb,henryfc,4,Sun Jul 12 04:07:18 2015 UTC,"It's a shame they just opted for the base manga adaptation because it's simply not that interesting and doesn't add anything really. They could've gone for an interesting piece of side material like Braunian Motion or the Epigraph Manga, that would've been preferred.   I also wonder about the quality of the translation. The synopsis text on the website seems awkwardly worded, and there's ""The Future Gadgets team"" rather than the ""Future Gadget Lab"" and so on.  Hopefully my worry will be unfounded."

steinsgate,3cvwk4,Blitzschnelle,2,Sat Jul 11 10:25:40 2015 UTC,"Because writers can write? We don't know the details beyond it being ""based off"" the Epigraph trilogy, if we assume that the manga we've been reading is just one of the routes we can assume the writers just wrote more, new routes etc.  Yeah I think a lot of us are pretty excited for it. I've read the manga too and even though I don't like manga much at all, I'm excited to see the stuff I've read animated/acted into some seriously awesome VN/anime"
steinsgate,3cvwk4,Alazais86,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:37:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah of course I know they can write, but if the main route has been determined by the manga, then whatever they right in would just be short branch dead ends etc which is a bit more limited. Of course, they could branch off totally from the manga somewhere which would be a good unexpected twist for us those that read the trilogy.  If it leads to the Steins;Gate world line eventually then we already know how it'll sort of end.... just to enjoy the details of how he got there. I wonder if the game will tell until he gets old etc... :)"
steinsgate,3cvwk4,Alazais86,2,Sat Jul 11 06:37:51 2015 UTC,"Zero is set in the Beta world line, Okabe dies in 2025. We know the end but true enough, the path getting there might involve a lot more than we could imagine if time travel is involved again, I'm looking forward to it.  Also we don't know if the manga is the main route, or if their other routes will just be small ending routes like previously, we just don't know. Though I'll admit their previous game was quite successful so  if we had to guess they'd probably try the same again, but we'll have to wait and see right?"
steinsgate,3cvwk4,Shaedana,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:14:53 2015 UTC,By the way does anyone know whether there are any of the original writers involved in the manga/Zero?  I just read the first seven chapters. It seems interesting but I'll wait for the VN for the rest of it. I'm dying to hear in detail what's really going on in Okabe's head and the manga adaptation doesn't really go deep enough. I loved in the original VN all the comments and observations Okabe thought to himself. I hope that Zero will continue following his train of thought and for that reason it'd be best if the writing staff stayed the same.
steinsgate,3cvwk4,Blitzschnelle,3,Sat Jul 11 08:59:27 2015 UTC,"Epigraph and Zero have the original staff working on the plot, yes.  The Epigraph Trilogy was penned by Takimoto Masashi, who is a freelance author affiliated with game companies like the one that made Steins;Gate originally. The story and plot were overseen by Chiyomaru Shikura and Hayashi Naotaka, the original brains behind the story.  As for Zero, Shikura and Naotaka have taken the helm for directing the plot and game itself."

steinsgate,3cslzo,lightfive,6,Fri Jul 10 21:35:11 2015 UTC,"I never doubted she was smart from watching the anime alone. If I understood it right, she was the driving force behind bringing moe culture to Akihabra. You need a certain level of intelligence to do something like that."

steinsgate,3cvr7a,Pink_Fedora,3,Sat Jul 11 04:31:50 2015 UTC,"To save myself from pretty much having to spoiler tag this entire post consider this a spoiler warning if anybody is reading this but has not watched the end of the anime!  Time travel is hard. So the 0.00001% shift that allows you to avoid meeting your past self works in episode 24, where he doesn't encounter the version of himself from episode 23. However due to Okabe being so central to the attractor fields convergence I believe no matter what % variance his past self is always at the radio building on that day in that world line. No matter what slight divergence you go to, he will always be there.  Yes the VN suggests that only one world line can materially exist at one time, though all others do exist in a state of potential and can become the real world line if the right circumstances occur.  As for Okabe getting the message, I assume you're still talking about episode 23/24 (and also 1) past Okabe obviously recieves the video message but cannot open it, future Okabe does not take his phone with him so he does not recieve anything. Not sure if this was what you were getting at, let me know if I've misunderstood."
steinsgate,3cvr7a,Alazais86,2,Sat Jul 11 05:19:29 2015 UTC,"I understood most of it. For the end though, when you say locked, is it inaccessible or just doesn't exist?  And future Okabe doesn't take his phone? As in leaves it?"
steinsgate,3cvr7a,Alazais86,3,Sat Jul 11 05:26:35 2015 UTC,"In episode 23 when Okabe goes into the time machine he gives his phone to Mayrui, it's in both the anime and the VN, to avoid interference with his past version's phone.  As for other world lines, the VN says that the many worlds theory is wrong, so there are not alternate active worlds where there are other versions of you alive doing their own thing. There are however alternate time lines or world lines where things potentially happen.  The main difference between these two theories is that if you go by the many worlds theory, it is possible for another version of you to come to your own world line and change/alter things. Under the world line, attractor field theory there is only one active world line and the only way things will change is if somebody in the current world forces the divergence to shift. So if you send a message to your past self telling you to take a train instead of a bus and you do so, you simply change from the world where you took the bus, to the one you take the train and the ""bus"" world line switches to a potential world line that exists only as a ""what if""."
steinsgate,3cvr7a,Alazais86,2,Sat Jul 11 05:34:03 2015 UTC,"Alright thank you, that clears that up. But now, if only a single worldline is in use, is it per all, or per person? And if for all, who decides the world line? I think it was shown in the movie, but I'm not sure."
steinsgate,3cvr7a,Davixxa,2,Sat Jul 11 05:41:00 2015 UTC,"the movie is not considered cannon and plays fast and loose with the established rules set up in the VN/anime, for example time leaping 7 days in the past because ""reasons"". I believe the world line is the same for everybody. If somebody changes the world line everybody in the world has their memories changed to fit in with the new events, only somebody with reading steiner could tell anything had changed.  The world line is just what it is, anybody can change/decide it if they have access to a time machine, that is why it started a world war in one time line, because whoever invents one first can rule the world."

He claimed he succeeded but stopped in the year 2000 to spend some time with his family and experience the world before the war.  In fact when he made the claim about the IBM 5100's ability to understand basic, that knowledge wasn't even available to the public.

And it's not clear on how exactly that D Mail prevented Kurisu's death; but we can infer that Daru changed something that had a Butterfly Effect until the Nakabachi Press Conference never happened. No Nakabachi Press Conference means no Kurisu in the Radio Building, means she lives.  edit: Remember, that D Mail moves them from the Beta worldline to the Alpha worldline. Future Okabe doesn't really exist in the Alpha worldline. And I take back the part about it being unclear. Because they moved to the Alpha worldline, Suzuha came back in the Crappy Time Machine which caused a big scene in the Radio Building by smashing a hole into the roof which prevented the Nakabachi Press Conference from happening.  edit: Also, the D Mail never said that Okabe stabbed Kurisu. It said ""I think somebody stabbed Kurisu etc etc""."

steinsgate,3ctp87,brothertaddeus,8,Fri Jul 10 18:21:50 2015 UTC,"Other comments are correct. This is in no way an ""adult"" anime and is very tame in general. At the same time, I also wouldn't go far as to call it a show ""for kids"". If you're trying to determine appropriateness (maybe you're thinking of watching this with a family member or whatever) and want the specifics to decide for yourself(minor spoilers):  There's an androgynous character who gets groped to test for his/her sex in a pretty non-sexual way. This happens twice.   There's a brief shower scene which is very tame by anime standards. Characters shown from the shoulders up.  There's a dramatic scene where a man and a woman have a physical altercation and he has to force ""kiss"" her to stop her from screaming and drawing attention. It's inherently non-sexual, but could give off a bit of a rapey vibe.   There's a character who is portrayed to be a bit of an antisocial creep. It's mainly played for comedy. This includes some not so subtle innuendo/double entendres, such as when they discuss ""mushy bananas"". That kind of thing. He is also stated to enjoy his ""harem"" video game.  There is some romantic kissing. Very tame.   All of the female characters are animated/dressed very modestly. See the subreddit background image. The one exception is a female character who dons a skin tight body suit for one scene. She is shown to be well endowed, but attention is never really drawn to this fact. There's is also a scene where a female character is caught in the rain, causing a see-though effect (you glimpse her bra). It's brief and part of a scene that is overall rather romantic/innocent in tone.   Characters tease each other about being virgins (characters are in their late teens) and their lack of sex appeal.   EDIT: Oh, and how could I forget. For some strange reason, they decided to put a very tame naked image of one of the female characters in the end credits. Everything is covered (she's shown waist up, long hair covering breasts), and it's more artistic in tone, if that makes sense. Think Ghost in the Shell, if you've seen it."

steinsgate,3cs0pk,ManWithDildoHands,3,Fri Jul 10 08:31:37 2015 UTC,"It takes place on the same world line, yes. The whole reason Suzuha was able to travel back to him to begin with is because his future self developed her time machine so she could go back and help him save Kurisu and prevent World War 3. His failing to save Kurisu on the first trip back in time really messed with him psychologically. Steins;Gate Zero is the story about this highly distressed Okabe and his inevitable invention of the time machine to save Kurisu."

steinsgate,3cs0pk,Yashirmare,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:07:14 2015 UTC,It was an interesting dynamic to see him suppressing the urge to put on the Kyouma act during the Epigraph series.  I hope they incorporate it in the new series.
steinsgate,3cs0pk,Alazais86,3,Fri Jul 10 10:11:36 2015 UTC,"This just got me thinking, what prompts the first Okabe (Not the one in the show or the one who sends Amane back) to create the time machine to begin with? Because if he doesn't fail to save Kurisu, and knows that fucking with time is a really bad idea (The whole Mayuri thing)... Fuck my brains melted. Time travel is hard."
steinsgate,3cs0pk,Yashirmare,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:54:27 2015 UTC,"Remember, the original Okabe before any time travel happens sees Kurisu dead in that hallway. That prompts him to message Daru, which inadvertently becomes the first D Mail. So all the time travel and Mayuri stuff happens. That's why ""Okabe sees Kurisu in a pool of blood"" is emphasized in the message Future Okabe sends back; that event is an Attractor that cannot be altered without changing from Beta to Alpha worldlines."
steinsgate,3cs0pk,brothertaddeus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:01:38 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about at the end, after the show ""ends"" timeline wise (but before it, if you get my meaning)"
steinsgate,3cs0pk,Yashirmare,3,Fri Jul 10 15:27:35 2015 UTC,"The future labs time machine is always created in the Alpha world line, it is probably the main thing causing the convergence point in that world lines attractor field. Seeing Kurisu in her own blood always happens in the Beta world line, thereby sending Okabe to the Alpha line.   The events that push Okabe into the centre of the entire mess seem inevitable as fate itself. Heck maybe him saving Kurisu and getting his happy ending might well be the convergent point in the Steins;Gate line. Even if it isn't effected by attractor fields from that point on, it had to start somewhere right? And yes, time travel is hard."
steinsgate,3cs0pk,brothertaddeus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:50:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, but Im talking about Beta line, after he saves Mayuri for the very first time, there would be no reason to send Amane back because he wouldnt have killed her himself and not sparked the idea."
steinsgate,3cs0pk,Yashirmare,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:55:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I'm having a really hard time understanding you. Future Okabe sends Suzuha back in the Beta line in order to save Kurisu and destroy the Nakabachi Thesis. Remember that the Beta line results in World War 3."
steinsgate,3cs0pk,Alazais86,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:11:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, but he knows that fucking with time is a bad idea. Im talking about the VERY first Okabe, not the one we ever see in the show. If he never stabbed Kurisu because there would be no future one to send back Suzuha, he has no reason to do it until he stabs Kurisu and realises there is a way to save her. He would assume the same thing would happen like what happened with Maruri prior to episode 22."
steinsgate,3cs0pk,brothertaddeus,2,Fri Jul 10 16:17:40 2015 UTC,"You're going into hypothetical what-ifs. All Okabes in the Beta worldline will send Suzuha back. That, too, is an Attractor. It's pretty similar to how all Alpha worldine Okabes will die in 2025, but never before and never after. Attractor Fields make paradox impossible by limiting the options available within them."

steinsgate,3cpdnt,Blitzschnelle,6,Thu Jul 9 18:26:09 2015 UTC,Great to see them side-by-side like this - it seems like they're really emphasizing a darker tone with Zero.  Side note - do you know where the Leskinen image is from? He doesn't show up in the Famitsu scans...
steinsgate,3cpdnt,reading-spaghetti,4,Thu Jul 9 21:00:53 2015 UTC,"A new magazine scan showcased the Zero designs for Leskinen and Professor Reyes. Reyes looks a little young for a character that's meant to be pushing 50, though, maybe she just has good genes."
steinsgate,3cpdnt,Shaedana,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:11:17 2015 UTC,I liked the manga version of Leskinen better. He reminded me of a finnish politician Alexander Stubb  Considering that Leskinen is a finnish lastname I can't help but wonder if Stubb's grinning face came up during the design process :P

Then I thought that due to being so detached from time, his future and/or parrallel world line information was blending into his consciousness.  I guess it's ironic to expect such story twists because his delusions are partly there to make fun of the teenage power-fantasy and ridiculousness of self-centered ideas.

steinsgate,3ck1av,spookycookiemonster,3,Wed Jul 8 19:27:07 2015 UTC,"Is there a particular reason it's called ""Zero?"" They emphasize it pretty heavily at the end of this trailer, and it goes where the PhoneWave went for the Committee of Antimatter logo..."
steinsgate,3ck1av,reading-spaghetti,6,Wed Jul 8 22:11:53 2015 UTC,"As /u/brothertaddeus said, it could denote the interquel nature of the title. But in this trailer we also see that the Zero represents a Moebius Strip."
steinsgate,3ck1av,brothertaddeus,5,Wed Jul 8 23:14:17 2015 UTC,"A ""Zero"" in a title generally means it's a precursor or a prequel. In a setting with time travel it can be a bit confusing, since it takes place both after and before the main novel. In essence, all of S;G0 will take place ""during"" the ~15 seconds between when Okabe gives up on saving Kurisu and when Mayuri slaps him and Suzuha has him watch the video from Future Okabe, which inspires him to try again by ""deceiving time itself"". This is the story of the Okabe who becomes the Future Okabe."
steinsgate,3ck1av,Shaedana,2,Wed Jul 8 22:20:22 2015 UTC,Does this mean that in the end of S;G0 the world and people's memories will disappear?
steinsgate,3ck1av,brothertaddeus,5,Wed Jul 8 23:35:15 2015 UTC,"We can only speculate on that, for now. But assuming the True Ending is the one that results in Future Okabe contacting the 2010 Okabe and telling him how to reach the Steins Gate worldline, then yes (because those events will never have happened). For any other endings, we'll just have to RAFO."
steinsgate,3ck1av,Shaedana,2,Wed Jul 8 23:40:26 2015 UTC,Sorry to bother you with questions but how was beta Suzuha able to get to 2010? If Okabe never saw what really happened he wouldn't continue his research and send Suzuha in the first place. Isn't that a time paradox?
steinsgate,3ck1av,brothertaddeus,2,Thu Jul 9 00:49:23 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing as a time paradox, because all instances of time travel involve a shift of worldlines. Granted, some of those leaps can have very small Divergence (less than 0.0000001%). Regardless, paradox is not possible.  Moreover, in all the Beta worldlines, Suzuha goes back to 2010 in order to recruit 2010 Okabe to destroy the Nakabachi Thesis and save Kurisu. The main reason Suzuha goes back is to destroy the Nakabachi Thesis, which Future Okabe discerned was the key to time travel leading to World War Three. 2010 Okabe always fails to save Kurisu at least once."
steinsgate,3ck1av,Shaedana,2,Thu Jul 9 02:11:24 2015 UTC,"But wasn't the whole point of Okabe witnessing Kurisu's death to motivate himself. That's why the video was able to come through but yet somehow Suzuha knew about it beforehand. There should've been a divergence shift after Okabe killed Kurisu, filling in Suzuha with the info about future Okabe's plans. At least that's how I see it. And I still don't understand why/how the incomplete video was received in the beginning of the story."
steinsgate,3ck1av,HitodamaKyrie,3,Thu Jul 9 02:43:29 2015 UTC,"The fact that Suzuha went to 2010 in the beta worldline is a key point of convergence for that attractor field. Even if she does not show up, the events leading up to WW3 would still occur, and the result would be the same.  Attractor fields are very resolute in their happenings. All potential paradoxes are already accounted for, essentially. What makes an attractor field is the decided result. The cause of the result can therefore vary.  Suzuha appearing on July 28th is already determined, we can assume that Okabe and Daru will create the time machine regardless. That is already decided. From Suzuha's perspective, she is already aware of the video mail, but all she can do is try to convince a distraught Okabe to go along with her. The fact that Suzuha appeared before Okabe with a time machine built by him and Daru though, precludes the fact that he must fail. The video that future Okabe sent was there from the beginning, but convergence demands that at least some iteration of Okabe gave up, rather than try again.  ...That was a bit more wordy and jumbled than I intended, alas..."
steinsgate,3ck1av,Shaedana,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:30:53 2015 UTC,I'm pretty dumb but are you saying it was inevitable that Okabe witnessed himself killing Kurisu? That would make sense but also prove the Kurisu ending misleading and pointless.. I really liked that Okabe hesitated to accept Suzuha's offer that was a really nice scene but now fatalism has ruined it :P
steinsgate,3ck1av,HitodamaKyrie,3,Thu Jul 9 16:37:56 2015 UTC,"That Okabe saw Kurisu lying in a pool of blood was established. Okabe did not know the cause, but he knew the effect. The effect had been determined, but the cause was not. He could try to change the cause to prevent that effect but convergence would ultimately bring about the established effect regardless, as it was a fact of the world.  I'm not sure what you mean by ""misleading and pointless"". The True End is a convergence on it's own. Okabe, who had found himself caught between the iron jaws of causality, is presented with the opportunity to right the final wrong. The dreams and experiences he bitterly sacrificed becomes a key that opens the gateway to a future that no one knows. A world free of the crushing exchanges of cause and effect."

steinsgate,3clt5q,SirRobertKiN,5,Wed Jul 8 22:21:31 2015 UTC,"The only thing the IBN 5100 was useful for was decoding the Echelon reports, not the Jellyman reports."
steinsgate,3clt5q,Alazais86,11,Thu Jul 9 05:02:56 2015 UTC,"They didn't need the IBN 5100 to discover the Jellyman's report, Daru could hack into that database on his own. The IBN was necessary for deleting the intercepted D-Mail from SERN's database"
steinsgate,3clt5q,Kyakan,3,Thu Jul 9 03:19:37 2015 UTC,That's not true. The jelly man reports were inaccessible until decoded. I recall having issue with this dialogue too
steinsgate,3clt5q,TheSlothBreeder,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:45:39 2015 UTC,"Hacking further into SERN to get those reports was something Daru managed on his own, it just took a little more time. The IBN wasn't needed for that. I remember thinking that was a plothole myself until I read the VN, which explains things much more clearly."
steinsgate,3clt5q,Tyrfing42,2,Fri Jul 10 13:09:07 2015 UTC,"In the Anime it definitely appears to be a plot-hole. You have this scene which is before the Jellyman's reports are read (The reports he's trying to read here actually are the Jellyman's reports, but he can't decode them and gives-up). Then they hint at the IBN 5100 being able to do it, and then you have this scene that appears after Daru fixes up the IBN, where they read the reports. It seems at least fairly implied that the IBN is being used to do it, even though it's displayed on Daru's computer, because they show us the 'Now loading . . .' screen on the IBN when it starts opening the files. From what I can tell, Daru's passing the code through the IBN to display on his computer (Probably due to the fact that he can't network the IBN directly to the internet because it's too old, and the decoded stuff won't run/display on the IBN anyway, it has a monochrome monitor).  Perhaps the VN handles this a bit differently, but I think it's definitely an issue because Daru not being able to decode the reports is what brings Okabe to go find the IBN in the first place, as at that time they didn't know SERN knew about the D-mail, and while John Titor had mentioned it in his posts, Okabe and the crew had no reason to go get it. If Daru managed to decode the reports on his own, then Okabe wouldn't have gone to get the IBN and Daru wouldn't have spent a whole day fixing it up.  That said, they did all know about the gel-nanas regardless of SERN's experiments. Even if they hadn't seen the pictures of the gelified people, believing that Okabe would turn into gel from attempting to leap back in time isn't really a crazy idea for them because they already basically knew that's what happens to objects in the microwave. It's a plausible explanation for why Kurisu thought of it and nobody asked about it. I don't see it as much of a plot hole anyway because it's really just a dialog flub - Fixing this issue would just take Okabe explaining the Jellyman's Reports to Daru and Kurisu, and then we're right back at the same point. The gel-nanas would probably lead them to believe it fairly easily. (To that point, wasn't there a skip where Okabe explains things to Kurisu for the up-tenthtime? It's possible he mentioned the entire thing in his explanation which they skipped over because it would have just been a repeat of what we've already heard)."
steinsgate,3clt5q,DSMan195276,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:13:55 2015 UTC,But the jelly man report was clearly deciphered with the IBM. It was immediately after the deciphered those research papers with the IBM wasn't it?
steinsgate,3clt5q,TheSlothBreeder,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:50:19 2015 UTC,"Not in the original story.   The VN gives detail on different levels of Daru's hacking. It describes how he first gets a random login and password, which lets him see the inter-office emails but doesn't have access to the Jellyman reports themselves. Then he uses that access to eventually find an admin's login info (I think maybe we even learn a little about the people who's IDs he hacked) which can access everything, including the Jellyman reports, with the exception of one database that has an encryption he can't identify.   And that final database (which turns out to be ECHELON, where the D-Mail that started everything is stored) is specifically what they need the IBN for, but it's gone due to world line shifting before Daru is able to get it working and connected properly.  They dropped a lot of that in the adaption to anime."
steinsgate,3clt5q,Tyrfing42,5,Sat Jul 11 03:56:22 2015 UTC,"The anime kinda flubbed with explaining that bit. As /u/Kyakan and /u/Alazais86 mentioned, the IBN 5100 was irrelevant for hacking SERN. In fact, Okabe found it after Daru had already hacked into SERN. Then Kurisu got suckered into helping to carry the IBN 5100 back to the lab, and that night Daru found the system admin's password,  letting the real hacking begin.  The IBN was only needed for it's special pre-APL/Basic programming language, in order to interface with SERN's secret ECHELON database, where the first D-mail was."

steinsgate,3cglfe,Altassin,3,Tue Jul 7 19:19:56 2015 UTC,"That's not how it works. Future Okabe sending the D-Mail wasn't enough to change the World Line alone. Past Okabe had to further modify the World Line with physical Time Travel. Thus, the observer's perspective from 2025 was lost and there's no chance of Beta Okabe shifting over to Steins Gate Okabe.  Not to mention the fact that the Video D-Mail was not actually a D-Mail."
steinsgate,3cglfe,Blitzschnelle,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:18:32 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the fact that the Video D-Mail was not actually a D-Mail.   I'll gladly take some spoilers, just tell me what you mean by that. I always thought the video was a D-Mail."
steinsgate,3cglfe,JedWasTaken,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:15:45 2015 UTC,"It was a new technology Beta Okabe had uncovered by 2025. It was called ""World Line Compression"" that splinters the message and sends it to multiple potential World Lines. But a special encryption makes it viewable only in the World Line in which it was intended for, it's why he receives the static mail in multiple World Lines including Alpha."
steinsgate,3cglfe,Blitzschnelle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:45:01 2015 UTC,"I.. see? So it's another bit of pure sci-fi. I thought maybe Suzuha send the message on the day Kurisu dies, and some future tech thing supresses the video until she enables it.  Either way, I'm not convinced on that. Suzuha could've just given him a recording of his future self."
steinsgate,3cglfe,JedWasTaken,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:57:11 2015 UTC,"The D-mail was sent after Future Okabe died, so there is no perspective to overwrite with."

steinsgate,3cglfe,AcidCH,0,Wed Jul 8 18:45:34 2015 UTC,A few people have suggested this but the show makes a lot of points around observational points. It basically says we don't know enough about the science in the show's universe and they outline this when Kurisu does her speech on how things might be different from her point of view than Okabes. The show doesn't tell us enough about reading steiner to confirm how it works and I doubt they would make our Okabe swapping his memory with future Okabe a plot point.
steinsgate,3cglfe,Tyrfing42,0,Tue Jul 7 20:22:10 2015 UTC,"If S;G line Okabe is going to get overwritten by the other Okabe, at the very least he'll have plenty of time to prepare for it. If not researching enough about Reading Steiner to learn how to acquire the memories of the new line like everyone else does (which feels somewhat unlikely because S;G Okabe kind of seems to want to distance himself from time travel research), than at least documenting his life well enough to give his post reading steiner self all the info he'll need."

I think it's sometimes to prevent reverse importation since anime's way cheaper here than it is in Japan. Either way, there's not much we can do except wait."

If you don't regularly go to our sub, and you know none of the characters except for those from Steins;Gate, please don't participate in this contest. You're welcome to come and read, or even ask people for their opinions (for instance, why did a specific pairing from S;G win or lose at a specific point, and who did they actually go up against) and that's all fine and good. As a rule we're a pretty friendly place, and we also have /r/vnsuggest if you want help deciding what to read. Newcomers welcome.  Having said this, the contest itself is an event for the /r/visualnovels community. We would rather not have /r/steinsgate, /r/katawashoujo, /r/fatestaynight and /r/clannad turn our fun community event into a staging ground for the sake of winning their favorite couple fake points.

steinsgate,3cayij,minybob4,3,Tue Jul 7 13:16:44 2015 UTC,"I don't really see the point.    It's not about the specific match-up.

Anyone that has read the Steins;Gate visual novel and wants to come discuss it should feel welcome to do so, and that would be all nice and good.

steinsgate,3c9tjf,omgwowplz,7,Mon Jul 6 05:42:00 2015 UTC,Everyone has Reading Steiner. Okabe just has a severe case of it. Especially strong memories are more likely to trigger it. Something as reflexive as Okabe and Kurisu's banter is going to be quite prominent.
steinsgate,3c9tjf,HitodamaKyrie,2,Mon Jul 6 07:06:14 2015 UTC,"If you watch the movie, which takes place a year after the show ends, then they talk about how everyone has the Reading Steiner ability in the form of deja vu, like /u/amril39 mentioned. That said, deja vu comes and goes, it's sporadic.   Okabe is special in that he can retain all of his memory from all the timelines; however, this comes at a price, which is the plot that the movie is centered around."
steinsgate,3c9tjf,lambro101,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:23:02 2015 UTC,"There was a hypothesis that all people may be somehow connected to he others in other world lines. At some point they discuss dejavu, and say that reading steiner may be latent in all people when it involves memories of significance."
steinsgate,3c9tjf,amril39,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:55:15 2015 UTC,"Watch the OVA, she remembers!!"
steinsgate,3c9tjf,alik2142,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:10:50 2015 UTC,"When a World Line shift occurs, since only one line can exist at once, everyone's memories are rebuilt to that world line. The thing being that it's not perfect and people are able to retain small fragments of their memories. Kinda like how when you copy a file and it goes corrupt; the process isn't perfect. Okabe's Reading Steiner allows him to retain his full memories as he shifts world lines, but a downside to this is he is completely unaware of what's been happening in the current world line he's on."
steinsgate,3c80la,also_not_a_scientist,5,Sun Jul 5 19:33:18 2015 UTC,"I know how you feel... the part of the manga where I cried more was the last scene and after that Suzuha gaves the IBN 5100 to Akiha Yukitaka and dies in the taxi...  Anyway, like Nanajamayo says in the Visual Novel he kills himself at home, in the anime the whole scene was changed (he kills Moeka, in the VN he didn't and many other things happens)."
steinsgate,3c80la,Bahamut92,2,Sun Jul 5 20:24:11 2015 UTC,I'm actually starting to play the VN. Looking forward to more heart wrenching moments.
steinsgate,3c80la,Bahamut92,3,Sun Jul 5 21:17:56 2015 UTC,"Trust me, it's a real worthy experience, prepare your mind and grab a tissue box because you're on your way for a feel trip! The Visual Novel is more detailed than the Anime, they cut many things, for example half of Faris D-mail cancellation story, and all the 6 endings that you can reach are so well-writed (Suzuha's one in part shocked me, Ruka's one made me cry like a baby etc.)  I wish that you enjoy that like I've! :)"

steinsgate,3c80la,ByrdInfluenza,2,Sun Jul 5 22:25:48 2015 UTC,"In the VN he kills himself in his house, I wanna say the anime put him in a construction place so that they could reasonably skip the Nae scene."
steinsgate,3c80la,Morthra,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:09:39 2015 UTC,"Could you explain the Nae scene? Love the anime, but haven't gotten around to the VN yet."
steinsgate,3c80la,lucaman,2,Mon Jul 6 06:38:29 2015 UTC,"Basically, the Nae scene is as follows After Yuugo kills himself, Okabe and Kurisu return with Moeka to her apartment, where, at Moeka's appointed time, Nae stabs her and runs off. Okabe then, instead of undoing Moeka's D-mail, Time-Leaps to before confronting Yuugo. While Kurisu and Moeka do the confrontation, Okabe waits out behind the house, and catches Nae as she flees. Nae then attacks Okabe with a knife, saying that she'll kill him in 15 years. It's also worth noting that in that chapter, either Okabe, Kurisu or Daru (can't remember which) notes that the Time Leap Machine had recently been used by a third party. Basically what happens is after Moeka kills herself (along with Yuugo), Nae becomes a Rounder, kills Okabe in 2025, and then uses the Time Leap Machine to return to 2010 to kill Moeka."
steinsgate,3c7wyx,Triplechecked,2,Sun Jul 5 19:01:54 2015 UTC,How much longer did you play for? I can't remember precisely which mail it was but one of them came very late compared to when the Wiki said it would but still I followed the guide and it worked out fine for me first try.   I'd suggest you make a save or keep a save from a little before just in case and proceed anyway. Worst case scenario you can always skip ahead back to where you ended up getting to if something needs to change.

steinsgate,3c7fmo,Shaedana,8,Sun Jul 5 16:21:53 2015 UTC,"The anime is great in my opinion, but you will find it follows the true route pretty accurately with a few minor changes and one big change (the 2025 thing with Nae is removed and changed completely).  To me it sounds like the Suzuha ending just gave you the wrong impression, it's a unique one of its kind twisted depressing ending in this VN, the rest of them are at the very least bittersweet in some fashion. Though I do respect the VN for making me feel so awkward during that ending.  The anime has an OVA episode 25 which deals with events one month after the end of the VN - Though it is not cannon and is decidedly devoid of much serious plot, it makes for much better ""closure"" and far far less ambiguity that you mentioned. If you're not okay with at least one of the endings being happy ever after you might be disappointed though.  On the positive side, there is a new VN in the works which looks WAY darker, that might just be right up your alley. Shame we may have to wait years to get it translated."
steinsgate,3c7fmo,Alazais86,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:47:59 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about the upcoming new VN but I wish it wasn't based on the beta worldline. I'd rather have an unknown worldline where'd be more leeway for things to go trainwreck.  I really hate happy endings, huh.. I guess sad endings (when done well) just have a bigger impact on me..."
steinsgate,3c7fmo,Alazais86,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:00:42 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that when done well, sad endings can be great. Happy endings with no sacrifice aren't as good but overall I think the one in Steins;Gate was great because it really made you go through a rollercoaster and there were some real downs in that story, it really put Okabe through hell, I think it would have just been too depressing to not have at least 1 happy ending from the several choices they gave us.  That said we have only a vague idea of the result of one possible ending to the new VN so who knows what dark routes it will take, from the tiny bit we've managed to gauge from reading the Epigraph Trilogy of manga it's pretty tragic."
steinsgate,3c7fmo,Morthra,5,Sun Jul 5 22:08:49 2015 UTC,"Well, in the Gamma worldline, Okabe lives as Hououin Kyouma, the tyrannical dictator that rules Japan."
steinsgate,3c7fmo,HitodamaKyrie,2,Mon Jul 6 01:17:42 2015 UTC,"Your imagined scenario would have a lot of holes, imo. First, Suzuha had already explained that the enemy was SERN and the Committee, not Kyouma. Okabe actually founded the Valkyries to fight against SERN. Kurisu being Okabe's hostage? No way. Besides, Kurisu wouldn't Time Leap for something like that. Kurisu doesn't believe in changing the past. Not to mention, she could only go back as far as August 11th. Nae only killed Okabe in the worldline where he confronted FB. He dies in 2025 regardless. The torture Nae did would hurt a lot more than one's arm. Okabe's imaginary pain was just that: imaginary. It's as real as my kamehameha wave.  So you made a far-fetched hypothesis and was disappointed when it turned out wrong?  The story of Steins;Gate was completed. Why would they have left that part of the ending ambiguous? Okabe had succeed in his objective, and found a worldline where no one knew what to expect, and Mayuri and Kurisu were both there. It's the triumphant success. Far better than a ""did Okabe die? lol who knows?"", imo.  Perhaps you should wait for Steins;Gate Zero though. It'll explore a sadder Okabe's world, after all."
steinsgate,3c7fmo,HitodamaKyrie,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"What's wrong in being disappointed and starting a discussion about it? I'm not saying the story was bad or that anyone should agree with me.  What Okabe and Kyoma did in the future would have been separate from each other. Suzuha could've lied/been lied to. But I did think Okabe started the resistance and Kyoma orchestrated the dystopia.  The twists and storytelling were unreliable in other places, like Titor and FB's gender. I think those were much more unrealistic actions than what I've suggested.  There was never a good explanation on the leap limits anyway. Kurisu had 35 years to improve her machine. I also suspected in 2010 she had put limiters on the leap machine for her own goal's sake, to keep Okabe (Kyoma?) on a leash just in case. She didn't trust him when she first leaped and met him, she saw him as a broken, dangerous man who she hoped to keep sane as long as possible. She wanted to love him but her future memories made her hesitate. That's why she almost didn't confess her love even though Okabe did.  Nae could've skinned his arm or burn it slowly."
steinsgate,3c7fmo,nitemarexzx,3,Sun Jul 5 18:27:47 2015 UTC,"Didn't say there's anything wrong with it, besides it seeming a little silly.  How would Okabe form the resistance to the dystopia and also orchestrate the dystopia itself?  Not a good explanation for the Time Leaps? I recall Kurisu and Okabe spending a good amount of time on it myself. Not much help from the peanut gallery though (Daru: ""Explain it with boobs.""). The limit of the Time Leap machine is caused by the gradual changes to one's brain over time.  Kurisu only had 24 years to work, and those 24 years were spent under the thumb of SERN, and they did not care about the Time Leap Machine either. They had her make a proper time machine.  Just a bit of Occam's Razor.  I was saying that Nae probably did a lot more than skin and burn just his arm."

steinsgate,3c7fmo,nitemarexzx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:54:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't recall them explaining the two day leap limit and it seemed pretty random. But whatever the case, considering how much the D-mail and timetravel tech was improved during the years I find it odd that the leap machine would be so easily abandoned.  Okabe and Kyoma would be two different personalities. Their ideologies contradict already. Right now Okabe is in control but like I said Nae would break him and Kyoma would take over. SERN world domination plans started in 2034 IIRC so there'd be plenty of time for Kyoma to get involved.  I'm not claiming my theories are waterproof of cohesive. I haven't put too much thought into it beside from few tin-foil speculations I made while playing through. Especially that one scene with Kurisu's scare triggered the ""oh fuck what if...!"" -flag in me. But naah, instead it was just a hint of her father issues. A totally boring and over-used character trait.  Edit: Haha I accidentally wrote ""CERN"" that's funny"
steinsgate,3c7fmo,Yashirmare,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:15:40 2015 UTC,"Father issues are a boring and over-used character trait? They're pretty common in reality, you know?  SERN's plans started at least as early as 1973, when they started the Z-Program. The goal of that being to build a time machine in order to control humanity from past to future and create a new world order. They finally succeed with that plan in 2034.  You might think Kyouma and Okabe contradict, but you'd be mistaken. Kyouma is a character who proclaims that he is insane and desires nothing but for chaos to reign and the system to be destroyed, but it's mere exaggeration. Kyouma is someone who seeks out would be companions, wraps them up in his petty schemes, and looks out for them in return.  Don't worry, I not poking holes in your ""tin-foil speculations"" as some form of ridicule. I'm just pointing out my objections to said speculation based on my personal understanding of the narrative.  Your ideas could possibly have merit in another world line. I mean, Gamma exists after all. Just watch out for drinkers of Mountain Dew."
steinsgate,3c7fmo,gizayabasu,2,Mon Jul 6 00:30:03 2015 UTC,"Hmm good point about Kyoma's personality. I do appreciate Okabe as a character and how his Kyoma act exposes his insecurities. He is one of the best written protagonists I've seen and the essential reason why I enjoyed the game.  However I do feel like there could've been more to Kurisu and the alpha world. I just kept waiting for some big reveal that never came. I pretty quickly foresaw what the true ending was aiming for. Although once again Okabe was the one that surprised me and made the ending worth it for me, not the story set up or the conclusion.  Yeah it's silly to be disappointed but there isn't much I can do about it. I guess I'll look into the gamma world stuff after watching the anime.."

Steins;Gate Zero takes place in beta world line in which Okabe failed to save Kurisu, after stabbing her himself and then returning, this is the story of the Okabe that gave up and spent the rest of his life working on a fully fledged time machine so he could be the one to send back the video message to his former self and fix things properly.

The dub is probably one of the best dubs I've seen tbh. Overall I slightly do prefer the original Japanese VA just because of Mayuri in the dub - we westerners just can't do the moe cute voice, she didn't sound right at all. That said, Daru sounded a lot better in the dub imo so it really is you win some, you lose some.  Okabe and Kurisu were done exceptionally well and are largely responsible for why the dub was so great imo. Obviously the ""Engrish"" scenes are sadly not nearly as amusing but it's a small loss when all is said and done. Both versions are great and if anybody is on the fence about watching the dub after the sub I'd say give it a shot, you might just find something else to enjoy about this anime."

steinsgate,3c3xqe,Blitzschnelle,4,Sat Jul 4 20:40:01 2015 UTC,I might get a lot of hate for this. I've watched  the dub/sub and I think the script is much better in the dub. For example I find some jokes to be funnier and more clever. These aren't the localized pop culture ones I'm talking about either. People point out there are mistakes in spelling but that really doesn't bother me one bit.
steinsgate,3c3xqe,JedWasTaken,3,Sat Jul 4 16:43:17 2015 UTC,I've seen some of the nerdy jokes in the dub and they seem hilarious.
steinsgate,3c3xqe,charcharblaze,3,Sat Jul 4 16:45:49 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you want out of a dub. While a lot of people seem to herald Steins;Gate's dub as something high-quality or special, I have to disagree. It simply rewrote most of the dialogue instead of opting for translation and the characters suffered as a result.  Here are a few of my major gripes.   The dub screwed up the calculations of when the D-Mail will arrive in order to lip sync properly, resulting in improper mathematics behind the very base of the PhoneWave.  Localizing all the Jap net references (I get why this had to be done, it was more of a personal issue)  Giving characters lines almost doubly as long as their original, forcing every other character in the scene to speak as shortly as possible, or even speak over each other in some cases   Giving characters voices that aren't anywhere close to their original - most prominently Daru, who's meant to be a creepy otaku, who gets the most ostentatiously American, fast-paced voice in the cast, it just completely opposes his intended character  Getting terminology mixed up, most infamously getting the most core plot element wrong in probably the most important scene in the show (Future Okabe mixing up the Alpha and Beta attractors), it's simply unacceptable  ""R""uka, ""C""ongroo, Kiry""uu"", the list of spelling mistakes goes on  Trying to throw in a reference to Chaos;Head but grossly misunderstanding said reference's role in Science Adventure canon, resulting in a line that doesn't make any sense   Some of the dialogue was altered to the point where it had a completely different or opposite meaning to what the original was saying. There are other minor things like Suzuha calling Okabe a ""freak"" in a couple of scenes that didn't come out like initially intended either. The bottom line is it's almost a different cast in the dub."
steinsgate,3c3xqe,nanajamayo,6,Sat Jul 4 16:21:35 2015 UTC,Good to know someone cares about detail. All the other people I spoke with worship the Dub like a second Haruhi.
steinsgate,3c3xqe,Blitzschnelle,3,Sat Jul 4 16:48:34 2015 UTC,"I didnt know this. No wonder that as I play the Vn stuff makes more sense in terms of how the phone wave and the parallel worlds work, they go super in depth, having only seen the anime dub prior.  But I have to disagree on daru.. Maybe it is common for otakus to talk like that in Japan but his jpn voice was just odd. He sounds like someones portrayal of a stereotypical nerd in a nickelodeon cartoon.. In my eyes the show is definitely on the realistic side so having that overexaggerated voice for daru while watching the sub movie was just ughhhh"

It's very, very complicated though, you have to really pay attention to what's going on.  Donnie Darko, 12 Monkeys, Time Traveler's Wife, About Time, Interstellar, and Edge of Tomorrow are some of my other favorite time travel movies. Back to the Future series is always a great one too, but that's one more comedic based than the others."

For the most part that is due to people's reactions, but in the case of the very first Dmail it was significant because SERN was looking for signs of time travel and picked it up. Them finding evidence of real time travel was what shifted the world line, and is the reason the gang needed an IBN 5100 so bad - so they could erase all traces of the first Dmail from SERNs database."
steinsgate,3buh16,meris608,3,Thu Jul 2 07:52:56 2015 UTC,"SERN was sure time travel was possible, but we're too lazy to do any initial research in case it wasn't. Instead they set up a huge communication network to pickup signs of time travel. Okabe tripped the system by sending the first D-mail (the ""Sent"" time stamp was later than the ""Received"" one) SERN then had proof that time travel was possible and started their own research into it, leading to their experiments with Kerr Black Holes"
steinsgate,3buh16,ChrisPRO44,5,Thu Jul 2 08:32:18 2015 UTC,But didn't SERN start their research in 2001? I was under the impression that the D-mais lead into SERN discovering the lab had developed time travel and after kidnapping the members their research was accelerated. This is what lead into the dystopia where Suzuha's incomplete time machine crashed into the conference room.

steinsgate,3buh16,HitodamaKyrie,2,Thu Jul 2 07:16:53 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned and you yourself alluded to, what happened was that Okabe's D-mail was intercepted by ECHELON. The evidence of that D-mail was stored in SERNs special database that could only be accessed using the proprietary language of the IBN 5100.  The part where it gets confusing, is how deleting that mail nearly a month after it had been logged reverts the changes. Presumably what that means is that it's never acted on in the first place. Does that mean though, that no one in SERN/etc had looked at the file by then? The mail couldn't have been erased retroactively, right?"

It's merely the phenomenon of retaining memories across worldlines. Okabe, due to interference from Suzuha developed a greater sensitivity to worldline fluctuations.   It's not that Okabe is the only person who can observe changes to the worldline, but that he can do so without any prompting."
steinsgate,3bte3z,Morthra,5,Thu Jul 2 00:13:01 2015 UTC,"I hope I'm not spoiling anything for you, but it does get mentioned at some point that being able to recall memories from other world lines isn't uncommon to people in general, its just that Okabe is much more tuned to it.  Dmails don't change Okabe physically, they allow himself in the past to -- just that -- get a text message. Remember the confusion he had over the first d-mail? Kurisu is alive, but the d-mail says she died. I think what you're referring to is the way the show will pretty seamlessly cut backwards and track the world line where Okabe gets whichever d-mail.  Also, keep in mind that the 48 hour stacking only works as long as the brain wave exists. So there's a hard limit that he can't go backwards past, which is 48 hours previous to the brain wave first becoming operational.  At least, that's how I understand it.

Remember when he came back full of despair but regained hope and received a video D-Mail from himself detailing how to succeed?  Zero Okabe is not that Okabe. Zero Okabe did not regain his hope.

If you have no saves, you can start again and hold down ctrl button to speed through all things until you reach that point.

Once you get back to it again there should be a blue flashing symbol at the end of the message to indicate there is a choice option here.

steinsgate,3bp0m7,jokiratv,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:54:21 2015 UTC,I came to the comments to write pretty much the exact same thing as you haha
steinsgate,3bp0m7,Pengolin,2,Wed Jul 1 23:41:26 2015 UTC,The editing in this video and the way the scenes flow together is amazing!
steinsgate,3bp0m7,Ankasammy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:50:35 2015 UTC,I feel the same way. This was the first amv I looked up after completing the series. Great sync with music and dramatic scenes.

steinsgate,3bo742,qupty,11,Tue Jun 30 20:09:53 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of respect for a show that can make me cry because I'm pretty critical about all the plot details and characters, how they develop and how believable they all are.  Steins;Gate made me cry like 5 times, maybe 6. Damnit this anime was a real feels trip and a half and I have such respect for the Writers and Voice Actors who managed to convey such emotion into the story like it was a piece of art or something."
steinsgate,3bo742,Alazais86,3,Tue Jun 30 20:34:30 2015 UTC,"Same here. When I finished the show, I did not get any sleep that night. It affected me that much. I was bawling my eyes out for the last ten episodes or so."
steinsgate,3bo742,twinfyre,5,Tue Jun 30 23:47:29 2015 UTC,"Well im on day 3 after finishing it and still not over it in the slightest. Im feeling straight up depressed and actually just questioned if it was because of the anime or not. Feeling like sht for days because of an anime, yep."
steinsgate,3bo742,DisregardDis,3,Tue Jun 30 22:57:27 2015 UTC,"Really? But it had such a sweet ending, sure it was sad as can be right up until the ending but it made it all up with the final scenes if you ask me."
steinsgate,3bo742,Alazais86,4,Tue Jun 30 23:05:42 2015 UTC,The ending was lovely but since i binge watched it it left me with a hunger for more. It left me with a hollow feeling which feels aimilar to a very mild depression.
steinsgate,3bo742,DisregardDis,3,Tue Jun 30 23:31:20 2015 UTC,"Read the VN, that'll help. Then there're the translated mangas, the novella, the audio cds, and the two other not-really-canon-but-still-fun VNs on youtube. Fill the hole with more Steins;Gate. And, if that's not enough, there's the rest of the SciAdv series."
steinsgate,3bo742,brothertaddeus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:46:19 2015 UTC,"This I can totally understand. That is why I'm sitting here every day, living semi vicariously through the wonderment and confusion of the new people who stumble in here after finishing it, hehe."
steinsgate,3bo742,Alazais86,4,Wed Jul 1 08:27:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't cry like in 5 years. Till i watched the anime, movie and Vn. Probably 6 times."
steinsgate,3bo742,MNeuer,2,Tue Jun 30 20:45:58 2015 UTC,I haven't gotten even halfway through the VN yet.  Is it as emotional as the anime?
steinsgate,3bo742,Motossmozerg,3,Tue Jun 30 21:17:34 2015 UTC,"Certain scenes were done very well in the anime and the music was better in it too but there are parts of the VN that really do shine brilliantly, especially near the end. I've never felt so sorry for a fictional character before as I did for Okabe after presses that enter key..."
steinsgate,3bo742,Alazais86,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:04:26 2015 UTC,"Ehh, depends on how you'd connect to the characters I guess. It's like asking if you cried when reading The Boy in Striped Pajamas after a lot of people cried during the movie. (Best example I could think of off the top of my head)"
steinsgate,3bo742,Yashirmare,3,Tue Jun 30 21:54:26 2015 UTC,"You're not alone. And I don't even cry often, especially over fictional characters."
steinsgate,3bo742,Youbiseiharukana,3,Tue Jun 30 20:16:58 2015 UTC,"I still tear up just thinking about aspects of this show, no shame."
steinsgate,3bo742,SwooshBear,3,Wed Jul 1 05:45:47 2015 UTC,Cried tons of tears because of the anime :<  The ep where Kurisu noticed Okabe not even thinking of his own feelings whenever he time travels after Mayuri's death.  And the movie too. Ughh it brings back all the feels
steinsgate,3bo742,speakmeriddles,2,Thu Jul 2 01:53:31 2015 UTC,"i cried a shit ton man  i just recently finished the visual novel (lile yesterday lol). cried a lot, and i even sobbed over the kurisu ending."
steinsgate,3bo742,nanajamayo,2,Tue Jun 30 21:57:35 2015 UTC,OP is bitch or S;G is great   not mutually exclusive propositions.

steinsgate,3bn10i,AcidCH,2,Tue Jun 30 15:13:00 2015 UTC,"Ehh, even if this theory is correct, the ability to time travel would be useless to anyone other than Okabe (well D-mails at least) and no-one has the technology to build an actual time machine similar to the Suzuha uses. Even if they did, surely Okabe would have noticed a change in some form or another (then again that wouldn't explain Nae in the VN, but it's only a theory)"
steinsgate,3bn10i,Yashirmare,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:09:43 2015 UTC,Well in the VN Okabe does observe a change.  He just didn't know it was Nae. When he's walking towards the lab and suddenly sees lightning and rushes up to see that the time leap machine was used
steinsgate,3bn10i,nitemarexzx,-2,Thu Jul 2 06:54:11 2015 UTC,"Cough Cough.... A GAME THEORY!... I'm sorry, I couldn't pass that up."
steinsgate,3bn10i,darkdeath174,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:35:55 2015 UTC,"If i understood without mistakes, time travels that created attractor fields are the cause of the steins;gate  timeline. Nearly all timelines are under the effect of attractor fields, and between the few that are free, the s;g timeline is the timeline where all attractor fields converge. S;g is the 'chosen' timeline because all the time travels that created attractor fields converged somehow in the beta timeline where s;g began."
steinsgate,3bn10i,ArnitChudyl,0,Tue Jun 30 22:19:19 2015 UTC,"Interesting stuff, quite poetic."
