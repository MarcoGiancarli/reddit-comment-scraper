EDIT: Jacked my own comment to say that I just did post links to my etsy and ebay pages but right now its probably still buried.   Thanks everyone!
DIY,3e16nm,cigaraway,31,Tue Jul 21 06:17:30 2015 UTC,"What's the best way to get the hole even without a way of centering it other than eyeballs?  I'm a size 9.5, is that how far down the mandrel I would hammer it?"
DIY,3e16nm,cigaraway,27,Tue Jul 21 08:54:54 2015 UTC,Get something about 1/3rd the diameter of the coin and hold it up to the edge and then work your way around the coin marking with a sharpie. You'll basically trace out a smaller circle you can use as a guide. You'll wantvto go a couple sizes past your target size and then reduce back down to a 9.5
DIY,3e16nm,bagged_lunch,13,Tue Jul 21 09:01:59 2015 UTC,Thank you!  And how do I reduce the size?
DIY,3e16nm,BobNelsonUSA1939,14,Tue Jul 21 09:26:48 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I work at a jewelry store.  You should be able to put the ring in a doming block hole that is slightly smaller than whatever the current ring size is so that the top of the ring will be sticking above the block slightly.  You can then use the press directly on top of the ring or have a flat piece of metal on top of the ring and then press it down.  Flip the ring often to make it even and check the size often, it usually doesn't take much, I would assume especially with something as soft as older coins.  If you're doing big size change (say 1+ sizes), you should anneal it every size or so you go down  Edit:  a wording issue"

DIY,3e16nm,mathemagicat,13,Tue Jul 21 12:44:50 2015 UTC,"On the one hand, the contemptuous treatment of a coin or a bill might be viewed as an expression of free speech, protected under the First Amendment. As such, the act might occupy a legal status of “expressive conduct” akin to flag burning, as set out by the U.S. Supreme Court in Texas v. Johnson (491 U.S. 397 (1989)) and United States v. Eichman (496 U.S. 310 (1990)).  So yea, as long as there is no contempt involved (good luck proving that subjective part), no harm, no foul. Well there's a bit of harm but no foul. The laws were primarily put together to discourage counterfeiters."

DIY,3e16nm,Cra15,35,Tue Jul 21 05:09:03 2015 UTC,I figured this was coming....lol.  2003...I was in a great mood because I had already lined up a purchase for that afternoon. A 1995 Suzuki GSXR 750   So as you can imagine I'm on cloud 9 all morning at my job as a cook.   It was a cute little diner/Greasy spoon we served breakfast all day and lunch in the afternoon. Closed at 2:00 everyday it was a great job.  So I'm slicing some roast beef for the lunch special that day and bagging it up. Process was basically slice up some roast weigh out 4-5oz and throw it in a bag roll it up and make nice little rows. Now normally this would be a mundane and boring but necessary evil that we just had to do every day. But that day was different. I was singing and happy every bag looked the same nicely rolled and lined up it was really going quite great.   I finished cutting the roast beef and put it in the walk-in...and went back to clean up my mess....  did a great job it was spotless! but was I satisfied with that! No way! I was in a great mood I was going above and beyond that day!  So.. I decide to sharpen the blade on the slicer. It had been a while and I figured why not? So I got it nice and sharp! its easy because it has built in fixture you just start the blade spinning and lower the stone down onto it. it was razor sharp.  So... then I had to clean it again because you get grit from the stone and what not all over it. So I unplug the slicer and I start wiping the face of the blade and that starts it slowly spinning...My finger got caught in between the blade and the guard and took the tip right off. Everything kinda went all slow-mo as my fingertip hung in the air for an eternity before landing on the stainless steel tabletop....  My buddy picked up my bike for me but I didn't get to ride it for almost 2 months...it sucked

Annealing is heating it red hot then letting it air cool slowly ? - i used to heat my raw knife steel red hot in the forge, turn it off and leave it to cool to room temp inside the forge and that made it soft as butter. Or am i confusing two different processes ?"
DIY,3e16nm,blomqv,7,Tue Jul 21 07:46:49 2015 UTC,Well heat treating processes are very unique to each type of metal and in fact there are some water quench steels as well at oil quenched and air hardening steel. Some require very very precise holding times and cooling times to get them hard. A lot of knife steel however is more forgiving 1085 or O1 will harden in oil quench just by heating with a torch until a magnet wont stick and dunking it in oil. But what I'm doing to the silver is a little different and maybe anneal isnt the right word. Its more like I'm just relaxing it. Think of a paper clip that gets bent repeatedly and eventually cracks and breaks. That the worry when cold working the silver that much. But by heating it up and cooling it. It kind of re-sets it back to a normalized state. At least thats my understanding.  I'd like to see some knives you make I love knives!

DIY,3e16nm,HoldingThePoop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:34:05 2015 UTC,Silver doesn't rust. Whatever you got must have been another kind of metal.

DIY,3e16nm,TheSystem_IsDown,3,Tue Jul 21 10:39:12 2015 UTC,"Some thing can be done with a different set of tools.  Like he said, don't have a punch, use a drill.  Don't have a press use a hammer.  You just will have to take it slower.  All those tools he used just makes the process easier but its still possible without them."
DIY,3e16nm,Ducreux4U,2,Tue Jul 21 12:56:14 2015 UTC,"Yep. A lot of the tools he's using is just the most efficient way. For example, if you use a handheld drill instead of a press, you could possibly make the hole off center, but that's no big deal. With a hammer instead of a vice, you could get uneven flattening.  But, like you said, take it slow, you will get a very nice result. If you rush it without the knowledge in do this in the first place, don't be surprised if you overlook something!  EDIT: He has a custom tool for making holes, but you could probably make yourself one (probably not worth the trouble unless you plan on streamlining)"

You lose the detail on the outside of the ring but you can make a really nice silver ring and some of rmthe detail on the inside remains

DIY,3e1tma,therealpygon,2,Tue Jul 21 08:33:55 2015 UTC,"Not trying to tear down what you've done because it's all pretty awesome. Any time I see anything I always look at what I might have done different and like to share it in case it gives some ideas for future projects, so that is why I ask:  Out of curiosity, was there a specific decision not to use the synthetic grass-like carpet like they sell at the big box store? Might be more expensive where you are, or just a design decision.  Also -- next time instead of the soft foam, you might consider using XPS foam boards (from big box). You can stack layers, glued together, cut and sand them to shape, and cover it with some bondo for a nice stiff and and fairly strong mounds/transitions without much weight if you thin the bondo (or even skip it). Added bonus that you wouldn't need a cup as much because you could just cut a hole in the foam."
DIY,3e1tma,therealpygon,2,Tue Jul 21 14:29:46 2015 UTC,"Great questions, and i like the feedback.  The use of the marine vinyl was based on simply having lots of it left over from a previous project, and it being basically weatherproof and easy to work with.  I ran out of my stock after 8 or nine holes, so i started looking for more.  The price from my supplier jumped from an already too high $20 a yard.  I also liked that it was colorful.  The miniature golf course supply houses offer synthetic grasses, but they were even more expensive.  Ultimately, i found what is called outdoor fabric that is also easy to use (cut with scissors, can be stapled) and is colorful.. and best of all, under $5 a yard.    it also ends up having a nicer playing surface than the thicker vinyl, and doesnt get as dirty during play.  as for the foam.. same deal.  had a ton of it left over.. still do.  In the previous project, i tried working with all kinds of stiff foams.  I could never get a good clean line cut with the hot wire...  so I didnt really consider that..    and the more sytrofoamy the board, the bigger mess.  the cup was a pain to do.   so that could have been a big beneift.  but ultimately, i could have just cut the hole and sanded."
DIY,3e1tma,therealpygon,2,Tue Jul 21 14:50:51 2015 UTC,"Understandable.    the more sytrofoamy the board, the bigger mess.   That's the nice thing about extruded polystyrene, it sands easily in a dust more like sawdust so cleanup is easy with a shop-vac. Expanded polystyrene (aka styrofoam) can burn in the fire of a thousand suns for all I care -- I hate that stuff."
DIY,3e1tma,therealpygon,2,Tue Jul 21 15:16:16 2015 UTC,styrofoam food containers are actually banned in our town for take out boxes.  I hate buying stuff only to open the box to find it packed in styrofoam..  great..  now i have no way of getting rid of it other than the dump..  is the extruded poylstyrene that pinkish material?  i didnt try that stuff..  sold in large 4x8 sheets next to other insulation materials?
DIY,3e1tma,diracdeltafunct_v2,2,Tue Jul 21 15:23:17 2015 UTC,"Yes -- that's the stuff. It's made for insulation, but a lot of people use it when they need to make a mold or other things because it is easy to cut/sand when you need to create a shape, yet doesn't compress easily (25lbs per sq in or something like that on compression).   Basically, it cuts pretty clean like a foam, sands/shapes almost like balsa wood, but holds the shape under the weight of fiberglass/bondo slurry/silicone/etc."
DIY,3e1tma,darloton,2,Tue Jul 21 15:43:09 2015 UTC,"thanks for the tip...   i'll pick up a sheet and play with it...  one thing i dont like about the foam is that where it runs up against the sideboards, it forms a deep V as it is tugged down by the stapled fabric...  it cant retain an edge / withstand the fabric.  it collapses..  same thing happens at the intersections of the 3 pedestals of the train hole..    and the ball gets stuck in those crevices.  a stiff foam would maintain that edge.  but to be honest, taking apart that train hole doesnt sound like fun either to me right now!"
DIY,3e1tma,reddhead4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:39 2015 UTC,"That's where a thin bondo slurry might help stiffen it if the foam does that. I used the blue concrete screws with washers in my basement (screwed down pretty tight) with minimal deflection. I would make sure to seal the foam if you're going to use bondo though -- a lot of people use art Gesso (or either white glue or acrylic paint, or plaster of paris mixed with white glue which is basically Gesso) to seal the foam before making a hard shell.  But, that gets into overkill for your application, but can be fun to do as another tool to approach a different project with."
DIY,3e1tma,reddhead4,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:57 2015 UTC,"If you have a ton of polystyrene you can actually melt it down in a small amount of acetone and then let the acetone evaporate off and store it in small compact blocks (or in the liquid form) to be melted down or formed later.  Just the right amount of acetone will make a silly putty consistency sludge.  Thats what you want to store or form.  If you dont really over do the acetone, you can make plastic sheets this way by letting it evaporate in a cookie sheet etc.     obligatory fire warning  You are basically making napalm don't keep it in its liquid form in anyplace that can catch fire etc.  Once its solid its much more inert."

They were very lucky that there was minimal engine work required and clearly there wasn't much rust. I hate the fake splity paint job but other than that its good.

Paint was $114 for primer, both colors, and reducer. All the parts I needed to get it running were bought used from Craigslist, local shops, or forums. The Masonite for panels was $8 at home depot (3 sheets) The black vinyl fabric was $5 a yard I don't remember how much we used. The tires were used from a junk yard for $4 each (hence the blow out lol). Speakers and radio were used on Craigslist $25 for all of it. The carpet was trash picked by a friend.

DIY,3e2vmv,azspeedbullet,3,Tue Jul 21 17:52:02 2015 UTC,"Not even comparable.  The harbor freight kits are bolt together.  This is a custom trailer that OP welded together himself with a beefy axle and large car tires that are suitable for off-road driving.  The harbor freight trailer would bend apart at the site of an off-road trail...  That being said, I'm not bad mouthing the harbor freight trailers altogether.  They are great for certain things such as the tear-drop campers that people make with them often on this site and other forums around the interwebs.  I even own one and it is perfect for hauling large items and supplies from the hardware store such as lumber short distances.  This allows me to have the basic functionality of a small truck without having to buy/pay insurance on one in addition to my daily driver."

DIY,3e2e99,MrMuscles25,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:05:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks, overall it was very easy. I bought a rustoleum epoxy kit from Lowe's (or maybe it was Home Depot) that was enough for a 2 car garage. First and most important step is cleaning the floor; everywhere i read online said it should take just as long or longer to prep the floor as it is to actually do the epoxy, because if its not clean enough the epoxy will just bubble/peel off. So to clean...    Grabbed a power washer, soaked the floor. Scrubbed the floor with a degreaser and course scrubber. Powerwash floor, rinse, and repeat. Did that twice.    Then I used an acid etcher (rustoleum sells these too for the kit, Lowes/HD should have them), washed with power washer, then repeated.    Once it was dry (the next day), I started putting the epoxy down with a roller. Helpful to have someone following you sprinkling the color chips because it dries fast.    I also put a clear coat of epoxy over it as well, this helps hold in all the color chips and adds an extra layer of protection"

But soon, you'll start noticing AA batteries coming up missing. They'll pry them from their siblings toys, TV remotes... your electric toothbrush.

Any reason you didn't go with a setting for the jewels (jewelry finding)? I'd be worried it will pop right off if it is just epoxied or something.  In a pinch, you can use an earring finding, drill a hole in the ring and solder that way."
DIY,3e2si5,Lucretian,3,Tue Jul 21 14:54:43 2015 UTC,"Stain on its own is ""flat"" its the type of polyurethane/sealer that you put on it that give you the actual finish you're looking for. Use a flate/matte poly and for stain use a semitransparent to keep the grain. Stain is tricky and different types of woods will give you different color finishes, stain hardly ever appears exactly as it does on a sample card. Best bet is to get a couple different samples in different colors within your designated color spectrum and do small test spots on the wood you're using (preferably in a more hidden area to avoid sanding out the test patches before final staining). When you find the one you like go with it. Different types of stains are going to give you a different finish. I'm only familiar with oil/water based and gel so I'll compare the two. Gel based stain is very DIY/beginner friendly but you give up quality. Gel is easy to apply and will give you the most uniform finish easily but they tend to hide the grain more than an oil/water based stain so it gives the finish a more solid color look than an transparent finish, also from my experience gel stain are usually much darker than they appear. Oil/water based stain is a bit more difficult to apply and to apply in a uniform fashion but the end result is much better. Its best to start with a wood condition before using an oil/water based stain as it help the stain absorb better into the wood and can help provide the more uniform finish. Take you time, go section by section, its easier to go darker than it is to go lighter so dont try and get your desired color in one shot. Not sure what other advice I can give other than good luck!"

If you're going to use it, you're looking at a lot more of a process. Skis of all types are typically coated with a pretty heavy-duty  heat-cured epoxy. Otherwise the flexing would simply crack it and it would pop right off. You can try a good two-part epoxy, but the even heat from baking is what really strengthens the epoxy.  May not look great now, but I'd bet good money it is going to look better than any of the other stuff will after a day of use."

Second to that is going to be standard sanded  plywood/underlayment which will look crappy, so you should paint -- doesn't look great but gets the job done. Neither is particularly strong for a top without cross-supports, so if you're concerned he might stand/jump on it hardwood boards for the top would be better, but pine could work in a pinch. If you really don't care how it looks, just start screwing pieces of wood together until you have a box -- anything else is going to be some work. If you're just looking for a box to put things in, a square piece of wood in each corner, a center brace to distribute flexing, and a bunch of glue/brad nails or screws will get it done. It can be as complex or as simple as you want to make it and will accept for your purpose.

DIY,3dui1a,PM_ME_YOURCHESTICLES,76,Sun Jul 19 16:58:42 2015 UTC,"That's a great point and a valid concern.  The closest tree is the thin one that you can see in the corner and it's 12 feet away.  It has a few high branches that I'm going to trim.  All other trees are at least 15 feet away and I do plan on trimming any branches that point in the direction of the fire.  Also, the first picture that I posted was probably an overly dramatic one of me burning some leftover straw blanket that I used to grow grass this spring.  I had the camera in one hand and a fire extinguisher in the other in case the flames got higher than anticipated.  I don't ever plan to use it for ""bonfires"", just little fires for roasting hot dogs with my kids."
DIY,3dui1a,GothicToast,62,Sun Jul 19 18:11:52 2015 UTC,"As someone who fights forest fire and works with fire law enforcement, I'd like to piggy-back on this thread with perhaps some helpful information.   Don't know your state, but many localities have their own fire ordinances. This might be city, county or state level. I'd check with your local fire marshal, but my main observation is the proximity to the forest floor.   The trees themselves aren't that big of an issue for a small fire pit. What I see more than anything is small fires close to the woods turning into big fires after they've been ""put out"". Generally you're fine when you're burning and attending the fire. The ashes left behind are the trouble.   Couple of hours later, if the wind picks up, it may stoke the ashes and blow embers into the forest floor nearby. If the conditions are right, this may ignite leaf litter and debris. Probably won't even be noticed until it's out of control.   So all of that said, I'd suggest a couple of things to make this awesome family gathering spot a bit more fire-safe.   First, maybe take a look at the amount of leaf litter. If there's a considerable amount within a 150' radius, or if you have seasonal dead grass that may carry flame to the leaf litter, perhaps look into cleaning it some. Clear out an open space. Doesn't mean you need to go cutting trees down or pruning branches so much, just take a common-sense approach to thinning out the available fuels.   Secondly, I'd look into some kind of grate to keep embers from escaping. This could also serve in keeping things under control once your fire is ""out"", given the scenario of wind stoking the ash.   Awesome job, though. I'm pretty jealous. It looks really, really good."

DIY,3dui1a,Spiralyst,3,Mon Jul 20 02:57:00 2015 UTC,"No need for a fire extinguisher.  Just get a fire proof cover for the pit.  When done, cover it up and smother it.  You aren't preventing a forest fire with a fire extinguisher lol."
DIY,3dui1a,Jyounya,10,Mon Jul 20 09:36:50 2015 UTC,Maybe just a straight cover (instead of grate) to put over the pit when you are done with it? That would all but eliminate the scenario where embers get blown out of the pit after everyone has gone inside.

DIY,3dui1a,DenCol99,16,Mon Jul 20 01:07:13 2015 UTC,"Nice addition to the yard!  At least here, there is a required 15ft setback from trees, structures, overhead lines etc - maybe it's the distance the photograph was taken from but this seems closer to 8-12ft from the tree line - if so you may want to at least trim if not remove the closer trees (or move the pit but that would be a shame after your nice work).  What do you plan to plant?"

I'm not sure what to plant, and I'm leaving it to my wife, but it definitely has to be something deer resistant.  So... maybe something that's not actually living?"

DIY,3dui1a,gonewildvideos,3,Sun Jul 19 18:50:22 2015 UTC,"OP, (assuming you're in the US,) not sure of your zone, but I have some plant suggestions. Since your fire pit arena is so close to the trees/insects, you will definitely benefit from some strongly scented plants that will repel insects and some animals. Choice candidates include: [lemon>citronella] scented geraniums, lavenders, lemon grass, lemon verbena, marigolds (french varieties are good for animal repellent), and maybe some ornamental hot pepper plants (mammals dislike hot peppers). Some of these are annual, some can be kept alive over winters indoors, and some are perennial but this will vary with your zone. Happy planting!"

I planted a bunch of petunias around the place and I think I've seen a total of 12 blossoms. The little devils eat every bud before it even has a chance to bloom. Sometimes, they'll nibble off a bud and just throw it on the ground... not even eat it! Pisses me off."

DIY,3dui1a,boredatworkbasically,9,Mon Jul 20 03:00:09 2015 UTC,"Looks awesome, man. My only comment is the pea gravel in the bottom of the pit. If you use your pit regularly you'll have to shovel out the ash regularly and lose a lot of your gravel in the process. Leaving it with a soil bottom would be just fine."
DIY,3dui1a,googuxcan,2,Sun Jul 19 17:14:15 2015 UTC,he can throw it the all in a wheel barrow of water and let the ash float to the top and skim. He can then dry out the rocks in the sun for a week. He can dig a little tailings pond for the resulting ash slury.
DIY,3dui1a,Derrial,2,Mon Jul 20 01:52:23 2015 UTC,"That's a good point.  I had to fill it in with something because it would have been too deep for oxygen to flow into the fire since there aren't any vent holes.  Dirt would have been fine, but the gravel is a little more decorative.  I have a few extra bags on hand if I need it."
DIY,3dui1a,NYCyoo,2,Sun Jul 19 18:14:45 2015 UTC,Could probably just use something like a kitty litter scoop once in awhile to sift some of the ash out without loosing a bunch of the gravel.

DIY,3dui1a,sageintheshadows,4,Mon Jul 20 06:26:44 2015 UTC,"The fire pit looks terrific.  My only question is why did you and other people build benches?  It seems like benches are the worst thing to put around a fire pit.  I just have a crappy ring, but I am constantly moving my adirondack chairs around the pit and changing the distance from the fire.  I do like how the woods behind it makes it actually feel like a very intimate spot."
DIY,3dui1a,thequirkyturkey,12,Sun Jul 19 19:47:19 2015 UTC,"I think that's actually a really good question. Those benches are expensive and time consuming, and once they're built, you can't move them. I suspect people have different reasons for doing so. One of the main reasons I did it is that they just look nice. You can see the firepit from our house, so I think it will be visually appealing (especially once something is planted in them) even when we're not using it. Another is that it's a nice flat surface to use. I have 4 kids. Last night we took down hot dogs, chips, and stuff to make s'mores and we had plenty of room to just lay everything out instead of having to use the ground. Another is that the seating is actually fairly flexible. If a large group of people come over, you don't have to make sure you have one chair per person. I have a couple Adirondacks down there and have plenty more room for some bag chairs as well. I wouldn't want to sit on one all night, but for my purposes I think they will work well."
DIY,3dui1a,Arion77777,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:03:17 2015 UTC,"Bonus: you can totally use the benches as a place to put potted plants if you end up finding chairs to be more useful for the fire! That could work out nicely if you plant vegetables in pots that can be moved away when you're not there so deer/etc don't eat everything. But you could totally grow things like bush-type tomatoes or eggplants to use fresh for shish-kabobs, or have some potted fruits like fig trees/strawberry planters/etc to snack on whilst enjoying the fire! Oh, the possibilities."

And in all instances it has been of value to be able to move your set near to or farther from the fire to modulate warmth. Also, the ability to rotate seating positions around the pit depending on wind/smoke direction. Thus, the fixed benches either side of this pit are of questionable value.

If you are not likely to use the nail gun again after building the fence I would suggest you look at a rental center to rent rather than buy.

I tore it up and there was horrible stubborn adhesive. After trying scrapers and chemical strippers to get it off all I ended up with was blisters, lost money, lost time, aggravation. It was just horrible. Eventually I broke down and rented this machine from Home Depot for about $120 bucks. Its basically a floor sander with this special blade attachment. Lots of mini razor-looking things that are covered in some kind of sand paper. Its also tough work, but it got the glue off the best.   After about 4 hours with this thing (i had about 300 sq feet) the blades started to fail and the machine was running unevenly so i stopped. There were some patches with glue on it still. I used concrete stain and decided to go over the glue with the stain and seal and it looks ok. Kind of looks like a natural rock, random thing."

DIY,3dzoj8,GreyGoff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:38:15 2015 UTC,"I built an over designed bed a few years back out of 2x4's.  They could absolutely be used to make a bed that will fit your needs, whether or not the desired look fits the bill is another question entirely. I tend to build for structural rigidity rather than to emulate something on HGTV.  Anyway it sounds like the main issue you are having is with the lateral forces causing the main bed plane to move around and loosen/damage the single screw that ikea puts in the end.  One of the best things to do when trying to strengthen any design is by adding things like this in the corners.  That will make a huge difference in the joint rigidity.  Remember, when building things rectangles collapse, triangles stay strong. As for the solid wood bottom, I don't think that's necessary.  If concerned about material bending and flexing directly under the mattress you are better off having thicker material rather than having one thin piece covering the whole area.  It is also absolutely possible to build a bed with more than four legs including one or more under the bed to prop things up.    Long story short, how much it costs is going to be more dependent on how nice you want it to look than anything else.  The above should give you some ideas for how to add strength to whatever you're envisioning and have it meed the requirements.  Good luck!"
DIY,3dzoj8,hollowlefty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:51:09 2015 UTC,"If you build a frame out of 2x4 or 2x6 yellow pine STUDS (not white wood) it will be extremely sturdy. The main area of focus though is not the type or quality of wood, but the jointing methods of the boards. For simple/hidden jobs like this I use a Kreg jig and some wood glue and it creates by far one of the strongest joints and is a hell of a lot easier to do compared to a dovetail or notched joint. After you build that solid base frame you can easily place some select pine on top of that and throw some stain on there to make a simple, cheap, reliable bed frame."
DIY,3dzoj8,rbegando,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:39:56 2015 UTC,"I tried to design a squeakless bed one time and nearly succeeded. The side rails were doweled and joined boards that were wide enough to fit two door hinges on each end. The other side of each hinge was fixed to the headboard/ footboard. The hinge pins were what held the frame together, and they kept the side rails from contacting the head and footboards - a major source of sqeaks. It was inexpensive, easy to assemble/disassemble, rigid and noiseless. It might work for you because it was as stout as a brick house."

DIY,3duhd5,Essjayc,15,Sun Jul 19 17:46:56 2015 UTC,What would happen if the buyer crashed the machine you built? would you be held accountable?
DIY,3duhd5,NYPD_Official,12,Sun Jul 19 18:06:50 2015 UTC,"It's complicated, but generally no. Normally you have different types of maintenance that are required before flight is allowed, and you have two or more engineers (that's me!) sign off on it in the craft's maintenance log. It's required by law in pretty much every country to have an up to date log. If the craft crashes and it's due to the craft's failure in some way, if the log was not up to date, it's whomever was responsible for allowing the craft to be cleared for flight. The pilot may also be at fault for not checking as well. It depends on the type of failure though. Mechanical failures are pretty rare as they are if it's properly maintained; most commercial failures are due to pilot negligence or maintenance engineer negligence, which is why we require two people to sign off for any maintenance we do. Sometimes shit happens though, and bad things follow.   Keep in mind, these gyrocopters are made from kits, and most engis like myself follow strict guidelines as to how something can be built anyway.   There's a reason air travel is so much safer than driving. Imagine before driving on a long trip, you had to have an overall inspection done (usually 30 minutes, checking for safety equipment being present, etc), and for every 5000 miles you had to have your engine competely torn apart, checked for failures and defects, and then put back together.   TL;DR; no."

But yeah, if you mean a car, engine failure is literally any single thing going wrong, at least if you're talking in aviation. Your engine light comes on? You are landing your car at the nearest airport.   But yeah, we rebuild engines a lot. Not as much as I'm kind of implying for an individual craft (maybe once or twice a year on a big commercial craft), but we do open them up all the time. With your car, your engine light comes on, you might smash the dashboard with a screwdriver to get the bulb to burn out or break so you don't have to look at it anymore.

'Let's move timing chain between gearbox and engine, what could go wrong (Audi engines)?

I uh, won't say where I flew mine, but yeah. Check up on local laws, because breaking regulations in the US I know is a federal crime and is incredibly illegal post 9-11 especially. In Canada it's also illegal to fly without clearance in most areas but you can get away with it in really deserted areas.

Honestly if you want to fly every day like that, and you live in a REALLY rural area (like Alaska), you might want to consider buying a small Cessna instead. A gyrocopter requires really fair weather to fly in, a lot of specialized equipment and training to maintain it (or it will cost you a fortune to pay someone), and airport fees are usually expensive, at least where I am.   Definitely ask, but don't get your hopes up.   I gotta ask though, what would make it more convenient than a car? Small gyros aren't really that much faster than a car I couldn't imagine."

DIY,3duhd5,Essjayc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:47:52 2015 UTC,"Well, that's clearly a a gas engine.   But how it sends power to the top rotor is of interest. I think it's electric. I say electric because I don't see a drive shaft but I'm still not satisfied with that, based on what's attached to the engine. It doesn't look like a electric generator. Maybe it's a drive shaft up the center column?   I'm not satisfied with that either, because the brace holding what looks like a starter motor at the top there looks like it passes through any potential driveshaft.   It runs on magic."
DIY,3duhd5,Derkek,4,Sun Jul 19 22:00:03 2015 UTC,"Gyrocopter main rotors generally aren't powered by the engine. They have an upward tilt that cause the horizontal stream of air to spin the blades. However, to get them to take off faster, you can use a small motor to give the them some RPMs before you start your take off run."
DIY,3duhd5,ElectricGears,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:18:03 2015 UTC,"The one I had, had a drive shaft in the center, but mine was also quite a bit more powerful than that engine there, and the frame was a little bit thicker and bigger overall.

DIY,3duhd5,Essjayc,2,Sun Jul 19 22:24:19 2015 UTC,Gyrocopter dont power the top rotor. The use the engine for forward movement only. The top rotor spins around as you move forward. Eventually it creates lift.

DIY,3duhd5,NotASmackAddict,3,Mon Jul 20 00:58:52 2015 UTC,"_> Not sure if joking or just being sarcastic, but I have worked in a Hydraulic shop for a very long time. Your rod seal will wipe out sooner than you think if it's not repaired in the proper way. Also what did you clean the sealing grooves with? You need to use a flapper wheel and remove some of the material until it is completely shiny, you don't need to worry about making the housing dimensions too large as the grooves need 10% anyways for  heat expansion, so a 3/8 groove would actually be .412 kind of thing you know. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_embrittlement I can spot the areas quite easily since I know what to look for, just be sure to keep the chrome covered and don't leave it exposed to the elements or the parent metal underneath of it will rust and then the chrome will start to flake off and the seal will almost instantly wipe out. A good shop will charge 350 for that size of landing gear as it is very easily re-sealed and cleaned. However for it to be 100% the rod needs to be re-chromed or replaced, chrome would be cheaper as it is a hollow rod so the machine labour cost would be much higher."

Once painted with some sealer and a lick of exterior paint it'll be quite durable and inexpensive. If you want to let natural light in you could use a piece of Acrylic or Perspex instead of the ply.
DIY,3dzhu0,GreyGoff,2,Mon Jul 20 22:18:54 2015 UTC,"Great, that sounds like the answer I was hoping for.  I don't care about the natural light, there's 2 other windows nearby.  The window frame is already solid, made up of 2x4s.  I just need to figure out how best to attach the plywood.  The AC unit could sit in the corner of the window.  Is there any advantage to using a ""through-the-wall"" unit vs. a window unit?"
DIY,3dzhu0,GreyGoff,2,Tue Jul 21 00:28:58 2015 UTC,A through the wall unit has a sleeve that you attach to the inner wall fascia. It usually rests on a bearer between two studs(frame). A window unit is usually a one piece deal although some of the bigger ones have a sleeve. It's easy to fit the sleeve and then slide the rest of the A/C into it. The weight is borne by the window sill. Attaching the plywood should be fairly straight forward. Pack out the window frame with 2 by4's and screw the piece onto the frame you created....Does that make sense?...
DIY,3dzhu0,GFK2K,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:18:33 2015 UTC,I think so... easier to install is good.  Is there any other difference between the window units and the through-the-wall units?  The wall units tend to be about 20% more expensive.  Thanks for the helpful advice.
DIY,3dzhu0,GFK2K,2,Tue Jul 21 17:54:58 2015 UTC,Look for a window unit that has a wall sleeve.  then you can finish the wall to the specs of the AC unit's wall sleeve and slide the AC unit in there.

It looks like you pulled the hinge anchors out of the lid when it broke (those little spirally things on the end of the screw). If that's the case, you'll need a new lid. Personally, I would try to re-attach the hinge by removing the plastic bezel that is around the lcd screen. Sometimes it has some hidden screws you need to check for, but usually it is snap-fit. If you pulled the anchors, it's not going to stay, so you might need to hot-glue the hinge until you can get a new lid off ebay."

DIY,3dyvdp,therealpygon,2,Mon Jul 20 17:52:29 2015 UTC,"The ""screen"" is comprised of three parts. The lid, which is the outer plastic piece that has the manufacturers logo on it (you see when closed or from behind the screen when open), the actual LCD screen itself along with the power inverter for lights (all of which attach to the lid), and the bezel which is the black plastic around the face of the LCD screen when you are looking at it like you were using it. A new lid often comes with hinges attached, or has the hinge mounts in-tact. It appears that your hinge mounts are broken, and if so, would require a new lid (you can reuse your LCD screen or buy a bad screen with lid and swap it).  The hinges are usually pretty tight due to the screen acting like a lever. You can oil them with a light targeted silicone spray or graphite spray but you have to be really careful not getting them everywhere. Dielectric grease can also work, it only takes a tiny bit.  If you remove the keyboard bezel (plastic piece with power button usually, between keyboard and screen), you get better access to the hinges, including the piece in your picture."

DIY,3dypzp,champ_chunge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:51:36 2015 UTC,"The two things you always want to do in an offer is 1) Ask for a capped fund for repairs paid by seller and 2) Make offer contingent upon inspection.  So hopefully you did those.    Your only response at this point should be ""I'd like these things fixed"", and refer to the inspection.  If there are multiple issues, it would be helpful to prioritize them.  Estimates and repairs are up to the seller up to the limit written in the contract.  They'll come back with a response saying something similar to, ""Contract says we will pay up to $x for repairs.  This repair will cost $x + $y.""  You then get to negotiate who pays for $y.  If they won't do it, you'll be free to walk.  Or you can just pay the balance.  Again though, that all assumes how the offer was written.  You mentioned the sellers possibly crediting you for the work.  I'm hoping you meant that they'll drop the price accordingly and not that you'll repair it yourself.  I think you meant the former, but if not, absolutely do not pay any money out of pocket until after closing.  Things could go south at any moment for any reason and you would be out this money.  It isn't your house until it closes, so do not pay for someone else's house.  This is also why they should be getting the estimates, not you.  I can't answer your other questions, but I can at least tell you that it's not your problem."

DIY,3dy11y,schuppaloop,2,Mon Jul 20 13:44:56 2015 UTC,"It all depends on your current home and how much you'd like to spend. You can spend a couple hundred or a couple million and most of it comes down to finishes and quality work.   Where are you located? I could build in California for a fraction of the cost it takes for me to build something for an east coast or northern state that has a deep frost line.  The backyard is where you don't want your cheapest bidder. The elements are really hard on outdoor products and if they are not installed correctly they will self destruct in a few months or the first winter.  Example, everyone putting stacks of EP Henry pavers around a garden border. 2 or 3 high and most of the people don't dig them down, stone, sand, and level. When this is halfassedly done, it ends up looking like a jagged teeth after the first good rain or winter.  Get a sheet of paper and measure your yard. Draw things to scale and you'll see what sizes of things you'd like. Concrete is ok for an outside counter, etc. What happens when your new counter cracks a year from now (it's concrete). It's hard to repair concrete without tearing it all up. Pick a finish that you can repair if need be."

How much labor are you capable of doing? Anything permanent in your yard will need to be below the frost line, which in your area is up to 3 feet deep. That is a serious depth for a person to dig without equipment. If you do a patio, even just 10x10 you have a LOT of dirt removal and volume to fill.   How big of a grill and what are your cooking styles? I made mine out of stainless simply because I can clean it easily and it's 9 feet long so i didn't trust a slab of granite that long without a seam outside (eye sore and winter weather nightmare).   What grill are you using?"
DIY,3dy11y,GolfCartStuntDriver,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:29:42 2015 UTC,"I am capable of doing whatever labor. Electric work I'll bring someone in for, at least to take a look.  I'm not sure how big of a grill - I won't be putting in the one I own, it's a shitty placeholder grill I bought while I was renting. I don't think it'll need to be too huge since I'll also have the smoker and pizza oven ideally."
DIY,3dy11y,GolfCartStuntDriver,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:40:24 2015 UTC,"Well, any grill worth putting on a fixed base to design anything around would be well north of $1k and that's just to your door. Even doing the labor your gonna have to rent equipment if you don't already own it. Your digging down 3 feet, chances of hitting large rocks are high.   Are you putting this on a pad?   Realistically and I'm not a concrete expert by any means. I only have foundations poured for my builds and you'd be surprised how much a yard of concrete is now.  Are you putting the pizza over and smoker on your lawn? Are you building them or buying them?   I'd say your at $10k for a concrete 20x20 slab and the grill in the box still in your backyard. How much are your permit fees in your town?   I'm not telling you it cannot be done cheaper or at all.   You should remove some items from your list of your concerned about budget. Do an item a year so you can buy quality products.  It would be a really sin if you spent $5k and a month of time for your patio to look like shit after the first winter. How long does a cheap $500 grill last? 3-4 years? So you have a fixed concrete base for a grill that now needs replacing. What if the replacement sizes don't fit? Your gonna have a permanent structure with a temporary grill. Your running outside electric lines and your gonna need a sub panel maybe. With electric and permits your looking at maybe $1k at least and that's cheap.   Before you even break ground you already know the grill is maybe $1k, the permits are lets say $500, the stone for the pizza grill $500, the electrician is $1k on the cheap end. Your already at $3k and you haven't really lifted a finger yet. This is just the products sitting on a grassy knoll.    I wouldn't attempt what your doing without $20k and"
DIY,3dy11y,GolfCartStuntDriver,2,Mon Jul 20 15:29:40 2015 UTC,Awesome - thanks for all this info!  That definitely fits within my budget - just didn't want to spend the $50k mentioned above.
DIY,3dy11y,GolfCartStuntDriver,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:00:15 2015 UTC,"Id start with the layout you want and then go from there. You'll know how big each piece of the puzzle is and you'll see on paper how much room you'll have and if things are too packed together or far apart.   I spent a good amount, some of it wasted just because my taste could be different for the next homeowner but that would be years from now so I get to enjoy it.   I was going to do concrete when I did mine but I was doing a 4ft walk way around our back gardens then  leading up to our back door. It was about 60 feet long and 4 feet wide and I just thought it would look too commercial that way. Stamped concrete for my size around the gardens and the garden borders out of the and material had me around $18k.   I did it with gray pavers, myself, she loved the cobblestone look so I bought those. Dug it out myself with a little rental and then laid stone around 12"" deep then another 2"" of sand i think. What I'm getting to is that I spent maybe $2500 and I was done. So I allocated the extra money around the yard. I got a 6000 gallon pond (if I don't call it a pond and I call it a lake they will make it go away) gazebo, wooden bridge, and the last piece was a pretty good sized pergola out of a nice wood.   I might have $80k outside, maybe more. I did it over 5 years just so it wasnt a huge blow to my budget. I have the best stuff you can get so it should last a little. Long story short, this stuff will be here 15 years from now if I sell. Maybe minor repairs. I couldn't afford to do it all at once, I'd be divorced. I also didn't want to buy the cheaper stuff and keep replacing it. I do things 1x.  I'm a woodworker, I try and build things that I know will outlive all of Ikeas furniture combined. I hold that true with everything, that's why i was trying to be realistic with you.  Pavers are much easier for a guy like you and I. If you make a mistake, you can tear it up. You can also go at your own pace, my final cuts took me a week because I didn't have time. Concrete, you have about 45min and you are either gonna be happy or sad at the end. I'm not trying to talk you out of concrete because that could be the best for you with your winters and heaving. The only problem with concrete is when it cracks, it doesn't stop usually.   What size space and is your yard sloped? How about a huge deck?"

DIY,3dyqz7,Knownothingatall,2,Mon Jul 20 17:13:50 2015 UTC,"4' gate isn't much of an issue. Standard heavy-duty gate hinges will do (lag bolts, not screws). My suggestions to avoid common long term issues are as follows:    Torque on the post - make sure the gate posts are set deeper and are strongly tied to the next post out. Setting both (two on each side of gates) deeper is even better if you can. If you don't, the post will begin to curve from the torque and your only option will be to replace it. Butting a 2x4 between the posts and using some screws won't do. I like a good dado, but some people don't like the work or the look. Either way, a strong connection to the next post out will distribute the load and prevent a curve/post-induced sag. As nice as it looks, don't put the gate hinges on a single post next to a wall unless it is tied to the wall -- use the opposite post.  Frame sagging -  use L shaped brackets and/or a proper no-sag kit. Don't rely on those cheap/crappy metal wire between the corners kits because they don't work worth a crap if your gate doesn't have a solid frame already. You can't have too much reinforcement to keep it square, but you can always have too little.  But that's just my two cents of having dealt with these same issues."
DIY,3dyqz7,therealpygon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:29:37 2015 UTC,Good suggestions. The No-Sag Gate Kit--Home Depot or Lowes is what I used on my gates. They have been kept square for fifteen years.

Get some mineral oil (note this mineral oil, the laxative, not mineral spirits, the chemical cleaner) from the grocery store/pharmacy. You can drink the stuff, so it's food safe.  Then, after install (or before depending on how much time you have), put a bunch of oil on it and rub in with a cloth, leaving a small even coat on the surface. Do this every day for the first week, then once every week for the first month, then once a month thereafter for maintenance.  Let the coats soak in as much as possible (minimum 12 hours). The wood will drink it up fast at first and then slower as it gets permeated with oil.

DIY,3dw8oj,Zombiesai,3,Mon Jul 20 05:10:45 2015 UTC,I've had butcher block countertops for over 5 years now. All I do is sand them and use butcher block oil once a year or when they look ready for oil. I'm actually doing them right now and they're looking great.

DIY,3dw8oj,mobydicksghost,2,Mon Jul 20 10:57:49 2015 UTC,"It's made by Watco, it's just called Butcher block oil. It's pretty good, it's made to be food safe and doesn't change the Woods colour much, just gives it a nicer appearance."
DIY,3dw8oj,Cant-Find-Username,-1,Mon Jul 20 11:21:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'm familiar with that product. I don't want to use it on my countertops because of the ingredient list, even though it is marketed as food safe. It still has mineral spirits in it and xylene. I prefer the mineral oil approach, despite its maintenance routine, because as I said before you can literally drink the stuff."

DIY,3dw8oj,hanoobslag,3,Mon Jul 20 12:14:04 2015 UTC,Im curious actually is it possible to just sand down the old counter top? I know you've already bought another slab but I hope someone else can answer this question as well.
DIY,3dw8oj,Bullyoncube,3,Mon Jul 20 01:51:36 2015 UTC,"It's unlikely that the marks on the old butcher block are more than 1/8"" deep.  Sand it down, use it for cutting, repeat, until it gets too thin.  If you want real butcher block, go with end-grain.  Has to be fully supported by the cabinet beneath, without a lot of overhang.  You lose some structural stability when you cut the boards down into 2"" lengths."
DIY,3dw8oj,Trghpy00,2,Mon Jul 20 03:50:59 2015 UTC,"Even if I did that, the boards in the old one are wider and do t look as nice as the new one. So I'm not sure that would be my personal preference. But it would be cool to know that for anyone else looking to do something similar."

DIY,3dvkgr,robnnorthaustin,5,Mon Jul 20 03:21:49 2015 UTC,BAD IDEA. The jack on any cell phone is not designed to support the phone and any lateral force on the phone will put pressure on the board and soldering inside the phone. The best you can hope for is that the plug will break off of the cardboard before it breaks the jack's connection on the board.  PS look at similar stands in any store and you will find something supporting the phone.

DIY,3dr5ad,causticspazz,13,Sun Jul 19 02:39:37 2015 UTC,"2 years ago I got a LiPo battery on Alibaba Express for $340 after shipping. It's the same capacity as 2x of the biggest $110 lead-acid marine batteries that Wal-Mart carries. It weighs about 15 pounds compared to the ~75 pound lead acid batteries. I'm really happy with it, although I can tell capacity is less now than when I got it 2 years ago.  For a trailer, lead acid might be fine. It's probably  not worth paying a premium for less weight."

Or if you're really committed to doing everything yourself, spend the lawn mowing money on an air compressor and cheap spray gun setup and you've got some new tools you can keep for future projects.

To the point where I would rather sand paint down than mess with a dried out rubber layer on top of metal.  The only reason I'd choose it over spray can paint is because 1) it's easily removable very soon after spraying incase you mess up which it is very hard to becaaause 2) you can paint with plasti dip with nearly no painting skills.

Also, if you haven't done this already I'd strongly suggest going over the frame/suspension/axle/wheel bearings since a 47 year old trailer may or may not have been properly kept up underneath.  Many of the trailers you see along side the road are because of bearing failure - we always keep a spare, pregreased set bagged up in the toolbox."

DIY,3dr5ad,WinterOfFire,8,Sun Jul 19 14:39:55 2015 UTC,"My husband and I had a trailer almost exactly like this. Took it camping 2 years ago, got all the way to our spot 3 hours from home and when we were driving over the bumpy road in the campground the frame broke up front just under the front edge of the nose. Middle of nowhere, no helpful tools with us just screwdrivers and wrenches pretty much. There was a tiny town about 15 minutes away that happened to have a metal shop that cut some angle iron for us then we went to the Ace Hardware and borrowed a drill. The drill ended up not doing us any good, took forever to drill one hole. So we had to call someone to come and do a quick weld job so we could get the trailer to my parents house an hour and a half away. Trying to come up with a fix took up the better part of our weekend."

DIY,3dr5ad,aenapoeka,3,Sat Jul 18 22:52:02 2015 UTC,"I have a dumb question that I full admit is a dumb question. Why does this have a tiny kitchenette instead of a tiny porta-john? This is something I've never understood about itty-bitty campers. I've always thought it would make more sense for them to have a pair of bunks and a teeny potty.  Which is actually how my friend's Dad fixed up his itty-bitty camper. It has bunks, a lil' potty and when it's on the road he throws an outdoor kitchen in there. A pavillion for the case of rain and they have everything they need. Or at least, this is how it was explained to me."
DIY,3dr5ad,Sherrylynnxoxoxo,9,Sat Jul 18 20:35:57 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I would personally prefer to have a tiny kitchen vs a toilet inside.  If it was a toilet instead, everyone would probably need to leave the trailer when someone used it (vs only the pooper leaving). Also, most campgrounds have toilet/shower facilities instead of kitchen facilities.  Of course, when we camp, we just take a tent, cook stove, etc. Hoping to have a camper someday, though!   (ETA: I also think the toilet smell would get pretty intense pretty fast in there. It's also more socially comfortable having a conversation around a stove/sink/countertop than a toilet (though the toilet could be enclosed in a small fold away box to mitigate some of the issues.)"
DIY,3dr5ad,ectish,2,Sat Jul 18 21:38:06 2015 UTC,"I guess I view the trailer as a place to sleep, primarily, not a place to hang out. I wouldn't eat in there, but I suppose I wouldn't travel during seasons that eating outside in a screened pavilion would be unfeasible?"

DIY,3dr5ad,WinterOfFire,2,Sat Jul 18 22:50:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would definitely be closer to a motel/hotel room (sleeping/bathroom use) with a toilet instead of the kitchen.  I have some relatives with big RVs. They park their giant campers at a state park and spend almost every weekend out there from late spring until fall. One of the campers has a small kitchen inside (probably as big as the kitchen in my first apartment) and an additional, outdoor kitchen that opens up on the side. Seems like a bit of overkill for me, but I've only done the tent camping thing."

DIY,3dr5ad,RatBustard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:50:25 2015 UTC,"You did a very good job. You have skills and dedication. The only thing is that you might have wanted to consider your color choices more carefully.  The first rule of resign in a small space is keep it bright and light. So no dark colors. The reason being is that darker colors give the illusion of it being a smaller space than it actually is, but with the same respect, using lighter colors will make it look larger than it actually is.  You using black paint on the cupboards and dark stain on the floor, might have been a mistake. You might have wanted to go with a light pine finish on the floor and maybe an ocean foam green for the cupboards. But when interior decorating, you must inevitably go with what the client wants. So if you explain the reasoning behind your suggestions and they still want a dark room. Then you have to give them a dark room. What I'm saying is that you might have known already that your choices of colors would make the interior look smaller, but you didn't care and went with what you liked.  I just wanted to put that out there.  Good job ;)"

DIY,3dr5ad,puckbeaverton,7,Sun Jul 19 14:24:06 2015 UTC,"I think they did a good job. While I agree about the dark colors and small spaces in general, I think they went that way because of the cushions which they were keeping from the original.  They painted the base under the cushions dark so the seating would blend in more and not stand out. Then the dark cabinets gave that choice good continuity.  The flooring complements those colors well."

DIY,3duoko,fireboxer34,2,Mon Jul 20 02:14:30 2015 UTC,"I have built a few cedar kayaks that were a bit heavier depending on the weight of the fiberglass cloth and other things.  I usually use 6oz cloth inside and out with a football shaped piece inside for added strength. That soaks up a bit of resin.  Then 4oz cloth on the deck which doesn't need as much strength.   There are ways of cutting weight including shaving 1/16"" off the thickness of the strips (sand carefully!) and using lighter weight cloth (but since my life may depend on it I usually opt for strength over weight)."

DIY,3drfk3,RC_COW,5,Sat Jul 18 20:35:10 2015 UTC,Did you not have an issue with the yeast that settles? I always recommend to people whom I give my homebrew to that they should poor it in a glass to avoid the weird yeast that settles.
DIY,3drfk3,RandomMamel888,8,Sat Jul 18 21:54:25 2015 UTC,Ya I do that too but I took extra steps to reduce sediment.  A few extra transfers and I was super careful siphoning.  I also cold crashed and fined with gelatin according to u/brulosopher method
DIY,3drfk3,_Ctrl_Alt_Delete,2,Sat Jul 18 23:13:15 2015 UTC,fined with gelatin   On thing to keep in mind is to be careful not to serve it to vegetarians (without letting them know of course).

DIY,3drfk3,PatSwayzeInGoal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:32:28 2015 UTC,Good stuff. Did you find the gelatin helped with yeast in the bottle? I've got some but I haven't brewed since buying it. I'd love to be able to just drink right out of my bottles.
DIY,3drfk3,jretzy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:46:22 2015 UTC,If I had to guess I would say it did help compact the yeast layer and make it less likely to stir up in the bottle.
DIY,3drfk3,cyberslammer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:55:44 2015 UTC,Look into Irish Moss if gelatin or poly clar doesn't give you the clarity you're looking for when you bottle. You can always give it another week or two in the secondary too before bottling time

DIY,3drfk3,Gibs830,15,Sat Jul 18 20:54:57 2015 UTC,You do have to sanitize everything. I brewed for a few years. I told everyone that brewing is akin to having the hobby of washing dishes.
DIY,3drfk3,BilzeriansHerpes,2,Sat Jul 18 22:31:11 2015 UTC,"The pH of beer is low enough that no harmful bacteria can live in it. You would have to seriously mess up for anything bad to happen, as it is a very hostile environment. Alcohol, CO2, low pH, anti-microbial hop acids etc....basically as long as the beer fermented (Even poorly) it'll be fine for consumption.  There are other bacteria that can live in beer. They wont make it taste good, but they absolutely will not harm you. One of them is Lactobacillus which is commonly used for making yogurt. It'll turn a beer sour, but it wont kill you."
DIY,3drfk3,MeanMrMustardSeed,3,Sun Jul 19 11:17:25 2015 UTC,Pretty much all of it has a tiny bit of something or other in it.  But beer was pretty much created and so popular because it's sanitary.  Sometimes contamination happens but it's never harmful...it just tastes bad.

I've still not had any tainted brews that weren't done that way on purpose in 12 years of the hobby and I keep my sours in the same general area as my straight yeast brews."
DIY,3drfk3,MindVirusMedic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:55:33 2015 UTC,B. Alcohol kills stuff.   Not until much higher concentrations than you get in (regular) beer. After all even yeast doesn't die until 15+ %.

DIY,3drfk3,jaguevarra,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:24:05 2015 UTC,"I guess it would be more accurate to say that there are no known human pathogens that can survive in beer.  Pure methanol is very dangerous and it can kill people. As little as 10 ml of pure methanol could blind someone and as little as 30 ml could kill someone. 30 mililiters is equivalent to the amount of liquid in a standard shot glass.  Methanol is found naturally in certain fruits and vegetables. It may also be produced as an unintended byproduct during the fermentation process. Spirits distilled from fruits, such as apples, oranges, and grapes, are more likely to contain methanol. Both beer and wine generally contain methanol. Studies have determined that wine can contain as much as 329 mg/L and beer may contain somewhere on the order of 16 mg/L.   If 5 gallons of wine containing the above mentioned concentration of methanol (329mg/L) were distilled, there could be as much as 8 mL of methyl alcohol in the first jar - a potentially dangerous amount.  Beer only contains 4.86% as much methanol as wine though... so to even get as much as 8mL of methanol (which is approaching a dangerous amount) from fermented beer you've have to consume 102.8 gallons of beer.  That's something like 1096 beers... it's just not a concern at all."

DIY,3du1su,mingy,8,Sun Jul 19 23:35:29 2015 UTC,"First suggestion would be find a crane company and get a quote, might be less than you think for the simple lift.  If you want to DIY I would do the below.  I would go to a rental company and tell them exactly what you are wanting to do. Give them specifics and they can usually help sort you out.   Remember that tracks on an excavator will probably do a number on your lawn so you'll have to repair that.  Finally if it were me and there was enough space I would look into a telehandler rather than an excavator. Built to lift, can get higher if needed, wheeled so it's easier on your lawn, and probably narrow enough for your needs."

DIY,3du1su,FredLives,2,Sun Jul 19 15:07:45 2015 UTC,Yes this.  Even an all terrain boom forklift can do this.
DIY,3du1su,Duckbilling,2,Sun Jul 19 22:52:29 2015 UTC,Just about any excavator can lift the pool the real question is how high you will need to lift it say over a fence etc etc. Either hire a company that uses excavators or find someone that runs them for a living then rent an excavator.
DIY,3du1su,Hillbilly72,2,Sun Jul 19 14:26:28 2015 UTC,"work with a construction company. First off, follow what mingy said and call a heavy equipment/crane company that has the know how to do this effectively. Whatever you do, DO NOT try to move it yourself (unless you have operated excavators in the past and feel you have the skill to do so).   Second off, you might have better luck with a crane company more than anything. The majority of excavators that you'll need to lift the pool (12 feet high min + chain/strap length around pool and attached to bucket) are all way past 9 feet wide. Most minis are 6 feet wide alone and those are the tiny ones. If you (or company) do manage to find an excavator that will fit, it's going to be a reaaaally tight fit, to the point where there will be literally no wiggle room. Calling is best bet. Or have your father in law take a look at it. Either way, good luck :)  Edit: Just thought about this, but you also need room for the excavator to swivel with the pool (unless it's a straight shot). If the excavator has to turn at all it's going to increase the width room needed because the length protrudes past the tracks when turning usually by around 2 feet."
DIY,3du1su,Threshable,2,Sun Jul 19 15:39:47 2015 UTC,"Rent a 120 sized trackhoe, brand won't really matter.  It is narrow enough to fit and will have More than enough lifting power to actually move the pool.  When you are moving the pool keep people far away and only use tag lines to control it.  People love to hold on to heavy loads and that's how they get hurt.  This could go wrong on about million ways but if you think it through and don't get in a hurry it'll be fine.  Good luck.

Me and my wife have been looking and most places we are going to buy from the installation and water fill is included in the price.    Are you actually saving a lot of money buying from a place that doesn't do this ?
DIY,3du1su,mrmadjet,2,Sun Jul 19 16:47:35 2015 UTC,We are purchasing from San Juan Pools. Doing a self install as far as I can tell from my research I should be able to save around 10k. Was able to get the shell for around 11k.

DIY,3du1su,Phindus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:01:06 2015 UTC,"While the conservative advice certainly is sound, an excavator is not that hard to learn to operate. If you're really into doing this yourself I say go for it. Sure, there's some risk but that's true of most things you try for the first time. Do your homework, find out the ways that people are injured and avoid them. Then, take a chance! Excavators are fun!"

DIY,3du1su,NeverEnufWTF,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:05:46 2015 UTC,As long as you secure the pool properly to the excavator you'll probably be fine as long as you go slow. Modern excavators are very precise if you are. Slow and small movements on the joysticks and you'll learn quickly enough.

DIY,3du1su,Freckleears,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:00:00 2015 UTC,"The excavator in your picture has a triple-jointed arm, which is going to be insanely hard to find at a rental store.  Also in the photo, there is a single strap being used to lift the pool; although fiberglass will flex a bit, that looks well beyond the structural strength of the rim of the pool.  This looks like an easy way to void your pool's warranty."
DIY,3du1su,Radar_Monkey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:37:20 2015 UTC,"There are literally hundreds of different makes and models you can chose from, the best one to get will be a suitable one that is available to you. Pop into your local plant hire place and talk to them about it, they may even recommend an operator to help drive the thing for you (there not difficult, but you can easily do a lot of damage very quickly). However, you should design your lift. You should be looking for the load to be hung above its centre point. Plant specs will display how much load a machine can lift at what radius. The minimum radius will be 6' + clearance (say approx 9'), but is likely to depend on the position of the excavator as it puts it into the hole in the ground (you will want to keep back so that the sides don't collapse. You should also consider how high you need to lift the pool, your gate is only 9', I assume you will be lifting over a fence or similar.To do this you will need to work out how to sling the pool properly, for jobs like this the manufacturer of the pool should be able to recommend a slinging arrangement. This will give you the distance between the bottom of the pool and the lifting point. Just add some clearance and the height of the wall. Good luck, but I categorise jobs like this as those that are DIYable, but it is generally just as cheap to bring in a pro for a short time."

DIY,3dw6cx,michael_mains_medic,2,Mon Jul 20 04:39:41 2015 UTC,"Misalignment will show at the top more than the bottom and it's easier to pull the top into alignment than the bottom, especially if the ground hasn't been compacted by time just yet. You need a solid anchor and a long nylon rope: make several loops around the top of the post and your anchor then with a broom handle in the middle of these loops, twist the rope over and over. You can easily exert great pulling force that way.  If you wish to pull the bottom then I see no other option than to dig, but you don't need to dig it right out, just dig on the side of the direction you need to pull, then pry the concrete ball to the side with a steel bar, or by driving pickets to wedge it out and into its proper place.  That being said, being off by an inch isn't a tragedy for a fence, it may be barely noticeable. The grounds is likely to shift by more than that over time."

The wood will shrink and expand and water will find its way in.  Marine plywood is probably a better wood choice.   Look at how houses are built for ideas on how to keep the weather out. Slopes with overlapped materials. That way gravity carries the water away instead of it puddling on the joints.

DIY,3dq21h,tinycatsays,5,Sat Jul 18 21:43:40 2015 UTC,Unless you intend to hand draw all the maps the lines need to be thinner. Having done similar and using maps from the books then converting to a table with thicker lines is a pain.

DIY,3dvt0r,blackcrackedpepper,3,Sun Jul 19 23:12:52 2015 UTC,"Note: your PVC Housing link has a bracket in it that's breaking it for most people.  Might want to fix that.  Crutchfield says those speakers are 2-30w RMS.  So, figure normal running at 12 watts * 2, give the amp a generous 60% efficiency says you need ~ 40 watts of current in, which is 3.3A @ 12VDC.  Simple: Sealed Lead Acid (SLA) batteries.  Same as used in computer UPS, battery powered kids vehicles, and many other high-current battery uses.  It's going to be heavier per amp of capacity, but less expensive than other options.  This one runs $36 or so and at 18Ah would give you several hours of run time.  Easiest way to get this is measure your available space and then go to a local battery supplier to see what they'll have that will fit.  Advanced: LiPo.  Here's 4000 mah @ 11.1 VDC.  You'd need a boost converter to push that up to 12-13VDC and a charger that can handle LiPo batteries.  Basically you'd get about an hour of run time for each battery you have."
DIY,3dvt0r,wanderingbilby,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:29:55 2015 UTC,What kind of charger could fit inside the enclosure for the Lipo so I can charge without taking it apart each time? Thank you for the help. Also. would going with a higher voltage battery with a buck converter be better?
DIY,3dvt0r,wanderingbilby,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:54:01 2015 UTC,Just go with whatever charger is recommended on the site for that battery.  You need a LiPo-specific one; generally they aren't physically large but they have electronics to properly detect charge state and not over-charge the battery.  You could do a higher voltage with a buck or other regulator.  Another battery type you could use would be cheap 7.2v batteries for R/C cars like this one.  You'd need two in series to give you ~ 14.4vdc which you may be able to run directly or use with a buck converter or LDO voltage regulator.  Cost appears similar to the LiPo but you might find them cheaper somewhere so worth mentioning.
DIY,3duc3r,alirobertson93,4,Sun Jul 19 15:37:34 2015 UTC,"Warm air can hold more water than cold air and always moves from warm to cold. In winter the heated air in the basement takes up water vapor and transports it out into the cold. It is the opposite in the summer.   Because the basement is several feet under ground the warm, moist air comes in, cools down and releases its water. Also living (breathing) and your bathroom add to the problem.  My best guess is to install a forced ventilation that exchanges the air over time."

DIY,3duc3r,DeadManLaughing,3,Sun Jul 19 20:34:36 2015 UTC,"A dehumidifier is a good start; ideally you would plumb it into a drain in the bathroom (most dehumidifiers have an attachment for a drainage pipe in the back, you will probably have to move a rubber bung inside to unblock the drain and block the pipe that goes to the removeable tank). It sounds more like it is from the air because it only happens in summer, a heater might work, but might just be too hot, depends on the basement. If it is coming through the walls or floor, that would be a bigger job, the best thing to do would probably be to get rid of everything from the walls and floor, stick a plastic membrane on and concrete on top for the floor and plasterboard for the walls, with whatever insulation you want. If it is from the walls or floor, you should be able to see marks, perhaps mould/mildew. If there is insulation on the walls you would probably have to look behind that. Try the dehumidifier first, you will need a place where air can flow from any part of the basement. There is no point having the extractor fan if you are using dehumidifier: that would just be drying out the outside air."

You said a couple of circuits, are they both on the same side of the panel? Have you confirmed that all other circuits on that side are good? If they are, you have either bad breakers or bad connections somewhere on just those two circuits.  If they aren't, try turning off all your 220v breakers, do your dim lights go out?"

From my experience and what I've been told, it's common for manufacturers to staple the carpet down throughout. You have to just pull it out in chunks and then pry the staples or hammer them down. Also, be choosy about your flooring. I put some peel-and-stick stuff in my van and it warped, melted, shrank and now peels off like taffy. Granted, we don't use it much for camping since getting our RV, but if I'd spent the time to put it in the RV (we full-time), it would be unlivable. I'm told by helpful hardware folks that any 'synthetic' flooring will do this and even some woods won't stand high temps / large fluctuations in temperature which is why manufacturers use carpet.

DIY,3duhe3,SaulTNNutz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:27:48 2015 UTC,"Since you the current home owner, the painters are right, you do not have to follow the RRP lead rules the EPA has. Realize that as long as you have the house, if you do not replace every piece of siding and trim that has paint on it you will always come up positive for lead.  Wash the house with a hose end sprayer with something like this http://www.homedepot.com/p/Mold-Armor-56-oz-House-Wash-Hose-End-Sprayer-FG511/100625157 . The pressure should be low enough that you are not blasting away paint chips.    If you want to be safe with the lead chips, always use a respirator when scrapping.   I would recommend getting thick rolls of  BLACK plastic,  3-6mil and duct tape those to the bottom of the house and  spread it out to collect chips. Like this : http://paintpartner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Scraping-Process-1.jpg.  The black plastic doesn't allow light to penetrate so it will not scorch any plants underneath it if you work quickly. Make sure to brush off the tops of window sills and other objects to clear the chips from the tops.  When you finish scrapping a side carefully roll up plastic and place in a thick exterior garbage bag and gooseneck the garbage bag like so: http://www.business.govt.nz/worksafe/information-guidance/all-guidance-items/asbestos-factsheets/disposal-of-asbestos-waste/image-disposal-of-asbestos-goose-neck.

If you want to get fancy get some birch ply. Its pricey (35 bucks per 4x8 sheet at HD but its nice looking) 3) Use nickel plated sawhorses ($10-15 at HD ea) as the legs and bolt them to the table top using 2x4s glued width wise to the plywood.

DIY,3dsnzm,ChuckieC,2,Sun Jul 19 02:12:54 2015 UTC,"It's not going to look perfect but good enough for a rental and cost around $20. First you'll want to get some expansion foam spray that into the hole until it starts to ooze out a bit, its a hollow door so your best bet it try and build it off of the other panel. Let it dry then take a 6"" taping knife and scrape the foam off flush with the door (you actually want a little bit of a recess so the joint compound will fill and make a smooth finish). After that take you take your 6"" taping knife again and apply some lightweight to the hole making it as smooth as possible. Dont throw a ton on there and try and get it in one coat, take your time so its less sanding and you'll have a better finish. Let the lightweight dry, after its completely dry lightly sand it with a sanding sponge until the edges on the lightweight feel flush with the door. After that just paint the one side of the door and you're done. Whole thing should take more than an hour. Good luck!"

I need to start doing more fun projects in SW.   Also, on your actual table, does the sphere have any contact with the glass?  I'd imagine it'd be good to provide some center support.  Likely not essential if the glass is sturdy enough, though.  It's way smaller in the CAD file."

However, during assembly, the whole thing skewed 1-2 degrees, so now a perfectly rectangular piece of glass won't fit. Making it go on top is a more universal solution though, and also works in this case.  The sphere does not contact the glass. It rests on the table members based on its diameter, and there were only so many diameters to choose from on amazon. The current top is 1/4 plexiglass and it does not sag much at all.

Digging a foundation out, I can see the need for a big piece of equipment (most likely a rental if you are really going DIY).  Using a water jet like this just takes the project outside of what I'd consider for a DIY project of my own.  If I contract out to someone to do the cutting, then it's not DIY anymore.

DIY,3dqfk5,athermalwill,4,Sat Jul 18 13:18:21 2015 UTC,If you're not going to replace the whole thing. Which I recommend as a contractor with 12 years experience. Rip out all the drywall above and install  green board at least. Personally if I was going this route I would install cement board and skim the whole thing. Starting with durabond 90 for my first coat of taping and then just regular sheet rock 45 or 20 for the rest. Make sure you use a solid primer and bathroom paint :)
DIY,3dqfk5,fire_bent,2,Sat Jul 18 14:22:43 2015 UTC,"Are you sure it is drywall and not green board or cement board? Oh, who am I kidding, I'm sure the builder used the wrong materials. They almost always do.   Anyways, short of ripping it out to the studs and putting in a vapor barrier and green/cement board, the best thing to do would be to sand it down, fill any low spots, and patch any soft spots, etc. It really might be in your best interest to swing that hammer and install fresh, but that could be overkill for something that might just be surface blemishes.  Now, after sanding and filling, find a good primer. I've used BIN shellac-based before with good results, but there are a few out there that are equally capable. Look for mildew resistance, anti-microbial, and stain-blocking.  Even more important than primer is the paint you seal it with. You want a semi-gloss or satin sheen paint. Keeps it slick so water runs off. As long as the paint forms a strong barrier, you shouldn't get any water penetration issues. I've gotten good results from various brands, but Behr is usually the most readily available for me.   Another option is to get a paint-and-primer-in-one. Not trying to promote them in any particular way, but Behr also makes a ""Premium Ultra Satin"" that does a good job.   The most beneficial thing you can do, seemingly more important than a good paint job, is to increase airflow in the bathroom. Either install a fart fan, or upgrade the one you have, AND USE IT. Let it run for a good half-hour after a shower. Open some windows too."
DIY,3dqfk5,bitofgrit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:03:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for everyone's input. I have come up with a working plan: I am going to scrape everything down, assuming the sheetrock isn't soft, I will skim everything with ""not so ez sand 90"". That stuff is pretty tough. Then I will prime with an oil base primer and paint with a semi gloss. I will try and remember to post pics."
DIY,3dqfk5,bigspecial,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:20:44 2015 UTC,"Are you sure it is peeling from the humidity? How old is the paint? The wall might have been dirty when it was painted causing the paint to peel. Best bet is to clean it, dry it, prime it, use good quality paint, and add better ventilation. Without the proper ventilation your bathroom will always sweat during a long hot shower which can result in damage to your walls."

I had never created an imgur album before and couldn't figure out how to rearrange the images through the app. I originally wrote a description with each photo but then they disappeared after I uploaded the set. I got kind of frustrated and just wrote a description of what I did as the first comment on the post.
DIY,3do5jl,jakkarth,8,Sat Jul 18 16:05:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry I'm not super experienced at posting to reddit and imgur albums, for some reason all the descriptions I uploaded the photos with disappeared.  I was tired of our dated 90's fireplace with pinky tiles on it, and I always felt like the TV sat too high when on it and there are no other reasonable places for a TV in our living room. Also needed A/V storage as up until this point I had an ugly floating shelf with wires everywhere.   Basically ripped out an old corner fireplace ( broken natural gas unit ) and built the frame up to the ceiling, finishing with walnut stained palette wood and a new electric fireplace unit.  Images show the palettes ( they were wet so had to dry them out ) , cutting them apart, staining them, the original fireplace, and the process of building it ( 2x4 frame covered with 3/8 plywood )  Stain was Special Walnut. The final image isn't truly final, I've since capped the bottom with the final missing piece but I can't find the image for some reason."

What is the new fireplace? Is that an electric one or a live fire? If it is live, is it safe to keep close to electronics and so close to the wood?  Where did all the space spots on the wall come from, we're you wiring stuff in the wall or just making mistakes?    Why do you keep the corner orientation,  was it the best setup for the room? Also did you not think of putting the large speaking in the wall when you were building?"

The patches on the wall were from some holes from shelving and pictures. We probably won't live here too much longer so I didn't want to get into putting my new speakers in the wall.

Shut off the water at the main, remove the entire handle assembly with a wrench on the closest nut to the body of the valve.

I pressure washed all the panels, re-dug all the hikes by hand and with a post hole digger, and set the posts in concrete, so there was a lot of wait time.  Personally I've done 2 fences, and I would start with the first post and measure center to center for the second post, hang your panel and continue.  Measurements can stack up over the length of your yard and you could end up with posts and panels that don't quite line up as you'd like them to if you tried to set all the posts before hanging any panels.

DIY,3doopd,kitehkiteh,3,Sat Jul 18 01:37:24 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming the finish coats are applied since it sounds like you have a natural finish on a red wood like red oak and they filled with pine filler. If so you can buy a stain pen to stain the filler. It's basically a stain sharpie. If the finish is above the filler simply but carefully remove the finish over the holes and dab the filler with the pen and let it dry and cure. To re-apply the finish just by a pint of the matching sheen, a pint of the sealer, and apply it one spot at a time with a q tip. Let each spot of finish fully dry before moving on to the next step. As a bonus you now have extra finish for small scuffs and scratches in the future!"

DIY,3doopd,kitehkiteh,2,Sat Jul 18 02:08:00 2015 UTC,If it doesn't take the stain then refilling will need to be done. Just take caution when filling them and wipe any and all excess filler (look for a dull film on the floor) so the finish will take in the areas where filler isn't needed and the finish coats haven't been re-applied.

I was meaning that when I rough in with 50 grit, the technique and angle I run the edger at leaves the 50 grit scratches flowing with the grain of the wood. The is easily done on long walls but you need to adjust the edger pad to a less aggressive cut angle to get away with it on the butt walls without leaving waves.   Do you mind if I ask what angle the nose of the edger is at when you're roughing in a long wall? And also, where is your cut edge angled?

It's easier to hide if you miss one because it looks like grain if it's fine enough and nothing stands out more than a cross cut in dark stain.  Now on to the tip for it. Swap your wheels out because it sounds like you have them on the wrong sides. (yes this is possible) Your cut side should be around the 1230 position, right above where the frame and disc wheel meet and form that fat corner on the nose. When you do this adjust the wheels until your edger is as flat as possible, the raise it until the 6 o'clock on the pad raises off the floor slightly. Now you have enough angle to cut but not dig while roughing in or fine sanding.   Once you have this setup do your long walls the exact same but angle the cut edge directly at the long wall. (Your edger nose should be facing 11 o'clock. Make your cut closest to the wall first with a slower pass from right to left doing this until you hit raw wood in one solid even strip, then pull back and work toward this raw patch from the big machine cut line, this is where you focus on getting the floor as flat as possible while removing the old finish and stain. Once you reach the wall cut back out with the same angle but make sure you go from right to the left then pull back about 2-3 inches. The angle of the cut along with the size of the disc makes these small passes cut along with the grain in a very small straight patter. (It really does cut straight for a fraction of an inch before the disc rotates more to the right starting the cross grain marks) Each small pass will blend the swirls left from the cuts you made going in to flatten the floor.  With the new edger setup you'll be working in a clockwise cycle around the room because as you already know your feather side is now on the left side of the edger.  Now to the butt walls. This is where it's more difficult to avoid scratches, unless you add an extra step. (Avoid this extra step on Pine floors unless you stop to add a pad.) Now start with flattening the base of the butt wall. Do this with your feather side against the wall while going from left to right and without idling turn the edge so the cut edge is against the wall and go slowly back to the left. Do this to highlight previous edger dips from an old sanding and cupped areas. Repeat this until you have flattened the floor. Now pull back past your drum mark and apply light even pressure while going in. Move slowly and lean your body to the right slightly (I found this is almost an effortless way to control the beast when it hits a tough knot, high spot, low spot or even while sanding through 100 year old tar paper) When going in have the edger nose facing 2 o'clock so the feather side is at at the wall and its not being cut. Make these back and forth passes going with the grain until you reach the end of your first wall cut. Once you reach this point get the pad off the floor quick, rub against the grain to check for high and low areas that you may have dug out. If it's flat turn your body and edger to the right so you face the 3 o clock or the right long wall. This is where you use the same technique as the long walls but without hitting the wall with the cut edge. Instead, find a plank that runs with you last clear cut. This is your imaginary long wall. The very end of the patch you're roughing in (if you make a 4 ft long pass on the butt wall to flatten it this 4 ft area is your patch) is your starting point. Now make the same final passes that you made on the long wall while inchining, yes you do have to move in 1/2 to 1 inch passes but let the machine float (I even lift on my handles just enough to let it wind out a little more than usual. Do not let your cut angle move from the original direction, this will make the current cut uneven and cause a noticeable high spot. Start your fist right to left cut just past the very bottom swirl line left by the light scratches the middle if the pad creates. Let it float with your careful guidance toward your butt wall getting the feather edge as close as possible to the base board without touching it at all. When you pull back do so in one fluid motion so you can immediately cut to the right and begin your next pass. Do this one pass at a time until you reach the beginning of the patch you're working. Continue these patches until you finish the wall. Don't be afraid to take an extra few minutes doing this because it will save you way more time in later processes.   When you start fine sanding add a fresh thinned out pad on every new job. You want it to be soft enough to cushion some of the weight but thin enough to minimize the pressure needed to deepen a cut.   Do the exact same method for fine sanding that you did in the rough in process, step for step. You'll notice instead of the usual problem of running through paper trying to get cross cuts out, you're now letting the edger float over the floor wiping out the 50 grit surface scratches left going with the grain. This done right will leave the 80 grit scratches invisible making your floor completely flat, smooth, and already looking beautiful. While doing you butt wall patches, be sure to change to fresh paper after every patch. This sounds wasteful but you want all of the patches to be cut evenly and not one cut with 80 grit and the one beside it cut with used 80 which smoothes it out to a mimic 100 grit.   If you do this right and watch your scratches on every pass, you will only need to hit the but walls with an orbital 1/2 inch from the base board and you will only need to glance over your long walls for a small missed hair scratch. I do every job this way and I have yet to hear a negative comment on my edges from the home owners, my boss, the finishing crew, and rest of the sanding crews.   Try a long wall first and if you do it right with the 50 grit and you can see you did (it's a noticeable change in the look of a 50 rough in) you can test it by asking your supervisor to check over the room you just worked (don't say specify if you roughed it in or fine sanded it) and when he looks he'll swear it's fine sanded until he breaks out the lights and gets down on the floor.   Just keep in mind during all of the rough in, your long walls you flatten going in and blend coming out. Your butt walls you flatten to the right, turn to face the right and blend it backwards to the start.   Edit: The cut angle is best as close to the 12:30 (top right of the nose) spot as possible. This helps keep the edger in a comfortable and effective position on your long walls and makes it easier to clear out the half moon on your butt wall rough in.   One last edit: When you rough in, never move on to your next patch until you feel the entire patch you're working for any small raises, dips, old finish or stain, even if one board's edge is 1 mm higher than any sounding wood, knock it down and flatten it with the rest of the patch. The slightest dip or raise in the floor will make fine sanding that much more difficult and time consuming."

If you want to drill it, you would really want a drill press.  The problem with tiny drill bits, though, is that they will tend to bend and skip off metal if the bit isn't somehow braced or guided.  The simplest thing i can think of for this would be to use a block of wood.  Drill through the block with the bit you want to use.  When it comes out the other side, you'll line up the earring with that hole.  You'd need to then attach the earring to the block in that position - maybe with screws + washers to hold it securely in place.  Now, when you flip it back over and drill through the same hole, you'll hopefully hit the point you want to go through.  You can't press too hard, or it might just shift the earring out of the way.  I don't quite know how big this thing is, so i'm not sure how reasonable that solution will be.  You would need to build a more elaborate jig if this thing is really small.

DIY,3dm52o,ep2012,2,Fri Jul 17 16:24:44 2015 UTC,I was trying to figure out an easy way to think about the semicircles. You slinky metaphor made the rules much more intuitive.

DIY,3dm52o,minotaurohomunculus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:41:09 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I thought, but the problem is you end up with 3 sided pieces in the middle which messes up the rules of movement. ""Opposite"" sides means counting every other adjacent side, so this is actually playable."
DIY,3dm52o,chuggingpills,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:35:21 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean. And while it would make it feel more like a chess board, the goal of this board is to represent the singularity in the center. The half-circle spaces are bent so it feels like you are curving around the singularity.  I am curious how it would make it different from the way I already played though."

DIY,3djhwz,kendii,25,Fri Jul 17 07:08:58 2015 UTC,"You actually can make one using magnets. I've seen one (can't find the link anymore) but basically you put whopping great rare earth magnets in the bottom of the legs, and in the floor. But you also need wire cables tethering it down like guy ropes on a tent. It's pretty hazardous if you muck it up. Even ordering the magnets is a pain. You basically have to plan your route down to how you're going to move them through your house and into position.    Obviously it is a very cool result, but you end up with awkward cables which end up in the way more than legs would ever be."
DIY,3djhwz,3226,27,Thu Jul 16 23:52:25 2015 UTC,"I used rare earth magnets in some bearings, and ones large enough to support a bed you would have to be very careful with. If you aren't careful they will have enough force to pull free of your hand, and when they snap together you likely will have a lot of difficulty getting them apart. That's only if the force of the impact doesn't shatter them and ruin them in the process... oh ya, and you don't want to get your fingers smashed inbetween them either ... have fun with all that."

DIY,3djhwz,workaccountoftoday,11,Thu Jul 16 23:47:07 2015 UTC,"Good point. You could always just throw some weights at the head of the bed. I've been looking for something to do with those god damn kettle bells I never use. I could make them a ""storage"" space up there."

DIY,3djhwz,JakeChip,13,Fri Jul 17 01:50:56 2015 UTC,Most water beds now have a series of columns each filled with water. Not quite the same as the giant water balloons from the 70s. Ex gf had one. No sloshing around like with the old ones during sex. Just kind of makes a whooshing noise. Ridiculously comfy though.
DIY,3djhwz,Terminus14,9,Fri Jul 17 02:04:22 2015 UTC,I always think of A Goofy Movie when I think about waterbeds.
DIY,3djhwz,Ryanlikesbutts,5,Fri Jul 17 08:47:37 2015 UTC,Gf and I had sex in my waterbed several times and I can confirm your suspicions. I had the old style (giant water bladder) and it sloshed so much. For completely unrelated reasons my waterbed is now broken and I've switched to a regular bed and have had it for about a year now. Sex is definitely much more rigorous and less scary.

If you're thinking of making one you can calculate out how much weight it would take to tip it based on the dimensions/fulcrum point and the total weight of the materials. My bed is about 120 pounds and it would take about 400 pounds right at the edge to start it tipping.

DIY,3djhwz,DaddyFatSax0909,8,Thu Jul 16 21:18:59 2015 UTC,The mattress may sag a little but I definitely don't feel it. I was thinking about putting some plywood in there but it would make it harder to disassemble and I've heard warnings about the plywood causing mold.

DIY,3djhwz,nobutterinhell,5,Fri Jul 17 14:44:48 2015 UTC,"Don't use plywood.  I just built a platform bed, and the easiest thing for me was to install 1x3 slats.  Plenty of room for the mattress to breathe.  In addition to the breathability, I recommend the slats because they even out the load distribution so you won't end up with saggy spots or noticeably uncomfortable bumps from the support structure.  Based on Pic 20, it looks like there are 3 main rectangular gaps.  Get a 2x4x8 and cut it into a bunch of appropriate sized bracers, mount them on opposite sides of the inside of those gaps an inch below the top of the wood, cut 1x3 to size, screw down into the bracers, and voila!  Really though, the whole thing looks great.  Well done!"
DIY,3djhwz,ShittyAssAccount,7,Fri Jul 17 02:56:44 2015 UTC,dont do plywood. you want the mattress to breath.
DIY,3djhwz,sam_i_is,2,Thu Jul 16 22:24:09 2015 UTC,Do you think the plywood around the edge is fine or should I drill holes in that?
DIY,3djhwz,DiscoAl,5,Thu Jul 16 22:26:47 2015 UTC,"You could also get an old shitty futon frame off craigslist and use that, it'll probably cost around $50 (I've been looking at similar futon frames for my expensive area) which will be quicker and easier.  Something like this.  That'll give you a very supportive base without a lot of fuss or worries about mold."
DIY,3djhwz,jarvispeen,4,Fri Jul 17 01:05:35 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I have a plywood board under my mattress.  I'm going to check for mold.
DIY,3djhwz,incredibolox,3,Thu Jul 16 23:17:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely should put slats in those areas, especially if you have a mattress with springs in, other wise they'll dip in that area of the mattress and you'll be replacing it quite frequently compared to a regular bed."
DIY,3djhwz,iwh,2,Fri Jul 17 02:34:40 2015 UTC,"Great job on the build, and either use slats similar to what you'd see with most beds you'd buy from Ikea as an example, or a large sheet with 1"" (or thereabouts) holes every 4-6"" or so which would be a lot more work and need a forestner bit.  It's probably easiest to go with the slats option, and a plywood sheet should give you enough slats that should cover the entire bed placed with 2 or 3"" gaps."
DIY,3djhwz,DeathMetalBunnies,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:14:05 2015 UTC,"Having worked in the bed and mattresss industry, I can assure you that your mattress will sag in the middle because it is not properly supported. Your frame may also obviate the mattresses warranty. Your finished product looks great and I especially like the stain, but spend a few more bucks and buy some plywood to cover that gap. You back will thank you, and your wallet will, too, when you don't have to replace the mattress in another year or two."

Asking strangers on the internet for legal advice is a bad idea. You need to contact your local permitting office to find out what the requirements are.  Generally speaking, if you're going to make it into a bedroom, you have to have two means of egress in case of fire. For a toilet, you also have to have a sink, and plumbing pipes for supplying water to those, plus drain lines to take the waste away and vent lines to allow for proper draining.  Other things to consider: electrical needs, HVAC, insulation. Studding out walls where the giant doors are now. Pest control. Potential structural issues.

DIY,3dmjbz,justin_144,2,Fri Jul 17 15:52:06 2015 UTC,"I made the mistake of using plywood for some garage shelves nearly identical to this. My problem was that I used too thin of plywood. It was maybe 1/2"" or a little thicker.  Almost all the shelves are now bowing in the middle after only a year. I'm going to have to jimmy in some vertical plywood pieces now to brace them, which will make the shelves more like cubbies, which is undesirable.  You might have better luck with plywood closer to 1"", but at that point, your cost is probably going to be similar to 2x4s."

DIY,3dmjbz,1live4downvotes,2,Sat Jul 18 12:45:01 2015 UTC,"Like right underneath the plywood. The ""frame"" of the shelf just needs more cross members. The plywood top should just be used so that you have a flat surface. You shouldn't expect it to hold stuff without bending.  It needs support underneath it"
DIY,3dmjbz,1live4downvotes,2,Sat Jul 18 14:25:59 2015 UTC,"Probably cheaper to use plywood, but I don't think it would be easier or as sturdy.  All you have to do with the 2x4s is cut it once to size and screw it in.  No ripping plywood."
DIY,3dmjbz,trudesign,2,Fri Jul 17 17:32:19 2015 UTC,"The OP's way is super easy but a little more annoying if you're trying to store smaller items since you can't slide them around if the 2x4s aren't perfectly aligned.  I have a ton of shelving I made in my basement that is just boxed framed 2x4s with the legs on the outside of the box. Then you just rest the plywood right on the box frame. If you use 1/2"" plywood it won't bow at all since it's going to be less than 24"" deep for typical shelving.  I like OPs for the simplicity but I doubt I would have done the double supports. In my opinion, that much wood can span the 5' unless he plans on putting a ton of heavy stuff on the shelves."

DIY,3dowyz,TheOneObelisk,2,Sat Jul 18 01:30:29 2015 UTC,"My not-too-pricy and not-hard solution would be a lock hasp. There are several types but basically when you close the box two pieces of metal will close together so you can put a padlock on. This way you would externally attach the hardware. You could rivet it on to be most secure but depending on how you plan to use it, screws would work too(easy to take apart though).   The other option would be to buy a new lock mechanism and switch it with the old one. This would look 'better' but might prove more challenging."

DIY,3dnudw,hmongxboi,5,Fri Jul 17 20:04:45 2015 UTC,"If you're set on doing this, you need to get rid of the drywall first to see what the studs look like and how they attach. I tore out a closet like this and the frame for the sloped wall was just two 2x4s toe nailed in to a header. it was clearly not something that would hold a lot of weight, and not something that likely take a dynamic load. Your method of just screwing some 2x6s across would probably work fine, but only if what's behind them can take the load.    That said, the space seems too small to be useful. Unless you're Spider-Man and plan to do overhang work on the ceiling too, you'd be better off building a freestanding unit outside for the money. When I was a kid I built a climbing wall out of my old tree house. It was awesome."

Very frustrating and we never used it.If you want to do it indoors go for traverse space and use an entire room. If you're just training get a hang-board and save the 300-400 bucks from the wall for months of climbing gym member ship or a sweet trip to some outdoor climbing.  If you do build something in the closet, I would advise building a box that wedges in all four corners and suspend the wall from three sides and the roof. That's what we did. It was freestanding(didn't affect security deposit) and held up. 3/4"" ply wall with the special climbing hold locking connectors."

DIY,3dobh2,limitless__,2,Fri Jul 17 22:19:15 2015 UTC,"Skip radiant barrier entirely.  Relocate duct line to run as low as possible. Remove insulation on ducts and verify air sealing is in perfect condition (mastic or foil tape, no Duct Tape), then reapply being sure to tape the seams on the insulation as you reinstall it. DIYable.  Add ridge venting to the attic space to provide proper ventilation. A little more risky on the DIY side, if you screw it up you A) fall off the roof or B) end up with a leak and a whole lot of trouble. Technically doable but you're in for an education.   Increase insulation in the attic space to R-60 or as recommended by the Department of Energy for your geographical area (DIYable, rent blow in machine from home center). Also make sure the conditioned space is air-sealed vs this attic space (DIYable, get can of expanding spray foam and seal penetrations from ductwork, plumbing etc to prevent air from moving from conditioned space (and insides of walls) into the attic and vice versa).  You should also conduct an energy audit if you haven't already. Many times your local utilities will subsidize having this done, either cash in hand or rebates on your bills etc, and there may be tax breaks available for all of this stuff as well. An energy audit will tell you better than we can where you're going to get the best bang for your buck/hour."
DIY,3dobh2,jakkarth,2,Fri Jul 17 22:34:41 2015 UTC,"Some questions and comments in no particular order:    1) If you have an anemometer (you can get them pretty cheap on Amazon...pretty useful to have), how does the airflow from the ducts in that room compare to the other ducts?    2) What size is the duct work for that room?  I see one duct labeled 6"".  Hopefully that's just for a bathroom.  You'll be lucky to get 70-80 cfm from it.  If your ducts are 6"", try replacing them with 7"" or 8"" ducts especially if that room is a long distance from the furnace.  3) If the air coming out of those ducts is consistently 10 degrees warmer than other ducts then that's a big red flag.  Air travels pretty quickly through ducts.  For example, let's assume yours are 6"".  A 25-foot piece of 6"" duct contains 4.9 cubic feet of air.  If it's delivering 75 cfm, then air spends about 4 seconds traveling thru the duct.  Even in a hot attic, that's probably not enough time to gain 10 degrees unless it's mixing with attic air.  Next time it's cool enough to spend time in the attic, take a close look at all your duct lines and their connections.  Also check your air handler for any obvious leaks.  4) As a corollary, I wouldn't worry too much about the installers hanging the ducts from the rafters so long as there are no major kinks.  5) It's probably not surprising that a room above a garage is a few degrees warmer than the rest of the house.  I'm guessing your garage is uninsulated and unconditioned so that room has a pretty large heat source under the floor (and, conversely, a pretty large cold source in the winter).  If you haven't done so, insulate your garage door.  6) 16"" of blown insulation is way too little, even if the installer didn't cut corners.  Blown insulation is cheap and you can DIY in an afternoon if you have a helper to load the hopper while you're in the attic.  Add another 20 inches."

DIY,3dobh2,slopecarver,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:26:19 2015 UTC,Don't forget to insulate under the floor/garage ceiling. Heat can be raising up from that surface. Also include a return vent to the rest of the house.

DIY,3do6ge,jakkarth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:49:31 2015 UTC,This was my exact thought. If there is not a good connection it will cause extra resistance thus causing heat. Also if the compressor is pulling more then the cord is rated for it will cause resistances and heat. I know when I used a extension cored like the one in the photo for no more then 1 minute the cord is hot. I'd get a bigger gauge cord for the compressor. Your best bet is a direct plug into the wall. The last thing I can think of is if the prongs in the head are not well connected to the compressor plug when the compressor is shaking it can cause the cord to shake and spark when the connections are moving around.

What were you using the compressor for when it happened?  An older cord might have more chance of there being oxidation in the plug.

DIY,3dmpx0,ctrum69,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:28:56 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks. And just asking, when repainting it, is their a process i need to follow like adding a coating before the paint itself?"
DIY,3dmpx0,Zender101,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:35:33 2015 UTC,That's likely going to depend on the paint you use.. read the instructions.
DIY,3dmpx0,thegreybush,2,Fri Jul 17 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"As an Eagle Scout myself having worked on projects that involve paint removal, I think your best option is going to be to try to get your hands on a pressure washer (usually Loews or Home Depot are happy to give it for an Eagle project with just a deposit). These will get a huge chunk of your dry/chipped paint off of anything metal without causing any damage to the equipment itself. If the paint doesn't come off with a power washer, it wont come off when you put a fresh layer of paint over it. I would then suggest getting a can of Rustoleum paint to cover up any sort of rusting that has already began. (I am assuming if your re-painting this playground that it has been weathered a bit). After you've removed loose paint, and touched up any weak spots in the metal, you can begin painting over everything that is left.  Post pictures when your done!"
DIY,3dmpx0,Bmorewiser,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:41:33 2015 UTC,Ok thanks. So to summarize: 1. Either find a power washer or angle grinder to remove loose paint. 2. Put rustoleum paint over the surface. 3. Proceed to paint. But should i put like a gloss or something on the surface prior to the actual paint itself?

DIY,3dmxj8,What_Are_U_Wearing,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:59:49 2015 UTC,"the easiest and quickest way, which is what I would do, would be to go down to the store and look at the 3 inchers that they have and measure the mounting dimensions in-store or buy em and take em home with you.  And yes the 3"" refers to the diameter of the wheel.  The other thing to consider is the weight rating on each wheel.  So if each wheel is rated @ 250lbs, thats a 1000lbs weight capacity( 250lbs x 4 or whatever number of casters you are using).  If you think that your bench setup might exceed that, then go for a higher weight rating and that might get you into the 4"" casters I dunno.  I just go down to the store and look at the weight ratings for each one and go from there. If you wanted to shop online...you'd have to find a site that has the weight and mounting specs listed."
DIY,3dmxj8,414all,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:46:26 2015 UTC,"and around my area here in cali4rnia...Home Depot has a good selection of casters...some are really good, with the swivel plates and ball bearings for swiveling."
DIY,3dmxj8,414all,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:52:31 2015 UTC,"nice.  You might not find 3"" casters that have a load rating of 100lbs.  Thats pretty light for 3"".  I would go for 3 or 4 inch anyway just for bulletproof's sake, and if the weight rating goes to 15 tons when you use 8...thats even better.  thats how I roll...build once, build strong, and it'll last a lifetime or more."
DIY,3dmxj8,414all,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:09:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot.  I will head out there later and check the dimensions.  I plan to use the 100 lb casters, as the cabinet won't have a lot of weight to it.  plus, once I put the torsion box on top, the whole assembly will basically have 8 wheels giving me 800 lb capacity."

The van broke down less than an hour from home, the transmission died, and at that point they decided that they weren't going down to Texas.  He wondered how much his life would be different.

We were pretty consumed in the build that we didn't keep a detailed tally of costs but these are my quick approximations.  $3,000 purchase $7,000 new transmission $10,000 renovations *$1,500 electrical *$750 plumbing *$1,200 cushions/beds *$500 paint *$500 registration/insurance *$550 roof deck *$5,000 interiors (wood, flooring, trim, etc.).  The trip lasted almost six weeks and just finished up. We are still avoiding adding up actual costs from the journey, but at 8,000 miles gas was probably around $2,400 (8000/10mpg = 800 gallons ~$3 = $2400). The most we ever paid for a RV parking spot was around $50, but most nights we either drove through the night, found street parking, went to Wal-Marts, or parked at friends. For food it was mostly McDonalds or cooking for ourselves with some splurges for local spots so that helped keep costs down.  Finally, the engine was a diesel cummins 5.9L, got about 10mpg.

Unfortunately, however, as grad students covering our own tuition through scholarships and loans, we also didn’t have much spare cash (white? yes. rich? no. funded by our parents? unfortunately, no). Most of us spent what little money we had left (or took out more loans) to cover the build and trip and were forced to do what us ""masters of entrepreneurship"" call “bootstrapping” for the rest. We looked at it as a business opportunity. Half of us have jobs lined up this fall which made this less daunting, however the other four of us that are still looking are very excited about selling the bus :)  Originally we hoped to make the bus a traveling billboard (we are entrepreneurship students after all...) but didn't get much traction there. In the end most of our ""sponsors"" were just in-kind, i.e. free battery swap, gift cards for McDonalds, etc. from companies that we approached that felt bad not helping in some way when they didn't want to wrap the entire bus in their branding. Only $1k was actual cash and there ended up being no promotional work or advertising done during the journey.   Most of what I loosely called sponsorship was actually money we earned doing marketing work for a startup company completely unrelated to the bus that we then put towards the bus. With limited tools, a small space, and 8+ people, we often had extra, competent 20something-year-olds that could go out and do this type of work to earn money for the project while the rest of us continued to build. Teamwork!  As for costs - we haven't calculated it exactly but rough estimates put the total project around $20k. 7 of that was the new transmission after we left so that really destroyed our budget. We were pretty consumed in the build that we didn't keep a detailed tally of costs but these are my quick approximations.   $3,000 purchase $7,000 new transmission $10,000 renovations:   $1,500 electrical $750 plumbing $1,200 cushions/beds $500 paint $500 registration/insurance $550 roof deck $5,000 interiors (wood, flooring, trim, etc.).    The trip lasted almost six weeks and just finished up. We are still avoiding adding up actual costs from the journey, but at 8,000 miles gas was probably around $2,400 (8000/10mpg = 800 gallons ~$3 = $2400). The most we ever paid for a RV parking spot was around $50, but most nights we either drove through the night, found street parking, went to Wal-Marts, or parked at friends. For food it was mostly McDonalds or cooking for ourselves with some splurges for local spots so that helped keep costs down.  Finally, the engine was a diesel cummins 5.9L, got about 10mpg. After we got the transmission replaced (including a 1 year warranty), we had no mechanical issues with the bus.

DIY,3delx9,sketties,92,Wed Jul 15 22:59:04 2015 UTC,"So, $31,500 counting that $50 parking fee. Divide that by the 8 of you and it was about $3,938 a person if it was split in cost equally.   Let's say you sell the baby for 45k that's $5,625 back a piece. Pretty good and you can get around 60k out of it at most if you find the right buyer (that would be $7,500 a person). Unless the miles on it are high, of course.   Awesome read, thanks my friend.  Edit: to count for what people paid for vs money back:  Sells at 45k: $1,687 back a person (assuming everyone pitched in for everything equally)  Sells at 60k: $3,561 back a person  Edit again: To those of you saying he won't get 60K out of it, I know they more than likely won't. I said, ""at most"". Keep this in mind; this is larger than a standard bus, it's registered as an RV (no longer needing a bus permit to drive it), it gets rather good gas mileage for it's size, keep in mind this has more room and is very modern than most RV's within the past 20 years that don't cost well above $80k.  Most RV's cost above $80k. So, $45k is definitely a steal for people who are on budgets."
DIY,3delx9,AtOurGates,6,Wed Jul 15 23:45:39 2015 UTC,"it's registered as an RV (no longer needing a bus permit to drive it)   That basically just means the seats have been removed.   has more room    A big problem with bus conversions (any type of bus) is lack of headroom.  Taller people can't stand up.  School buses used have the lowest ceilings of all buses, although that's starting to change.     and is very modern than most RV's within the past 20 years that don't cost well above $80k. Most RV's cost above $80k.   A lot of the cost in an RV is the appliances and systems.  Just going by the photos and blurbs, a few systems seem to be missing:      No shower stall, and the toilet is just a camping toilet-- basically a bucket with some chemicals; they don't have a black water (turd) tank on the bus.   No furnace for heat.  No propane stove for cooking.  (Using camp-style propane bottles in the passenger compartment is unsafe.)   No off-grid refrigeration.  Batteries won't power a fridge for long.  There are two possible solutions:  Buy an RV refrigerator (which uses a propane flame instead of an electric compressor), or buy a generator.  I don't see either in the pics.   Structurally, the bus chassis might be better than the chassis in an $80k RV, but the bus power train is probably worn out with high mileage, and it may lack overdrive gears that you'd want for highway driving."

They either took out (more student) loans, or used cash they had.  The bus cost ~$20K. They spent ~$2,400 on gas.  They tried to get sponsors and plaster the bus with logos etc., but that didn't work very well.  They got some direct (e.g., gift cards, batteries etc.) sponsorships.    If you could get the thought of all the ""magic"" that happened in there out of your mind, $20K doesn't seem like a bad deal for this rig.  I'm assuming they'll at least get their money (+/- sweat equity) out of it."

We've read stories about more traditional conversions taking much less time. We even met some people on the road who ripped out half the seats, strapped in a fridge, threw some mattresses on the floor - only took them a day!  As for space, there was a lot of asking for forgiveness later when it came to parking and the bus essentially became our workshop and storage unit. Most of the time we took our apartment's four parking passes, stuck them all on the bus window, and parked it across four spaces out back.

DIY,3dls98,diytry,2,Fri Jul 17 11:39:43 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough I just did something exactly like that :)  I really recommend avoiding the grinder, the dust is just unimaginable.  You are either going to have to remove the high points (and patch around them) or fill everything to the highest point.  Removing is hard if it is already painted, I ended up chunking things quite a bit. If I tried that again I'd use diamond paper on my orbital sander, linked to a vaccum (or rent a concrete grinder and vaccum).  Filling means skim coating it with something. Your options if you are set on painting it again are plaster of paris or joint compound. I've seen recommendations online for the http://www.texmaster.com/magictrowel.html but I haven't used it.  What we did was use American Clay, which is a different finish that you won't paint afterwards: http://www.americanclay.com/ If the walls are already painted then it's a three coat system (if it's sandpapery rough concrete then it's only two coats). The first coat is primer with sand in it. I'd say that texture of 1/16 is no problem with their second coat (Loma).  Of course you are going to end up with a different texture, since that's the point of the clay).  Of course you could always glue or fur drywall onto the wall :)  But then you gotta tape, mud, sand, mud, sand, mud etc."

DIY,3dl8xf,sexykim66,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:29:46 2015 UTC,Pull the baseboards off. You might need to buy taller baseboards if the drywall the old ones were covering is in bad shape. Are you asking if you need transition strips to go from laminate to tile? The answer is yes. Do you need transition strips for a a large continuous area of floating floor? The answer is maybe. Even though your laminate comes with a pad attached I would ask if there is another pad that you can put down underneath that.

You can get different colored extension cords... might be enough to get a white one if you have white walls and make sure the cord runs close to the wall. It's usually okay to make very small holes in walls (like nails for hanging pictures). Check your lease. You might also be able to use something nailed-in to hold the cord in place near the wall.

DIY,3djgqe,Qarlo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:30:48 2015 UTC,Second call for laminate - ours looks good and the kids have been beating the hell of it for 6 years.
DIY,3djgqe,cpk1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:27:39 2015 UTC,If you get nice laminate it will look good and last a long time. However if you get laminate do NOT cheap out on the flooring or it will look like total crap. You can tear out the carpet and install floating laminate (yourself). Technically you would only need a circular saw but chop saw and table saw make a big difference.
DIY,3djgqe,Guygan,3,Fri Jul 17 06:20:32 2015 UTC,Start with the deck. Get your feet wet with demo'ing and building things.
DIY,3djgqe,boomboomdead,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:53:56 2015 UTC,"I agree, especially because places like Home Depot can plan a deck for you down to the amount of screws you need and how many cuts you'll need to make."
DIY,3djgqe,abnormal-anomaly,3,Fri Jul 17 01:28:01 2015 UTC,"They all sound like DIY projects to me.  For carpet, you'll need a knee kicker to stretch the carpet.  Recessed lighting you'll need to read up on wires, and buy a hole-saw. It'll make things go by 100x faster.  Solar tube, make sure the flashing is properly set, if you have tile roof, then I don't know.  Ground level deck pretty simple to do.  Vanity and flooring, might take a weekend for a first timer. Very simple.  Complete bathroom---this might be your largest hurdle. It'll take a while to find the perfect fixtures, tiles, mirrors, cabinet, etc. Not hard, but very time consuming.   Assume the worst with all jobs, mold, mildew, dry rot, broken drywall, uneven floor, leaky roof, make sure you read before attempting."
DIY,3djgqe,matuba,2,Thu Jul 16 19:55:53 2015 UTC,"The deck is a really easy one.  TONS of examples on this sub for inspiration and guidance.  I would start here.    The vanity/sink is also pretty simple.  The plumbing portion can be a pain in the ass, but patience and attention to details are all it really takes to do it right.  Solar tube is doable, but I'm always wary of putting holes in the roof myself.  Lots of leak potential and getting the shingles looking right afterwards is not my strongest skill...  Recessed lighting is feasible, but electrical is an easy place to really fuck yourself.  Wouldn't try this one without assistance from someone who knows their shit (or at the very least have it inspected afterwards by a licensed electrician).  It isn't so much the difficulty as it is the potential severity of the consequences when done wrong.  Linoleum is a pain in the nuts, but a smaller bathroom is the perfect place to learn.  Go for it, but be prepared to maybe redo it (or learn to live with it being crooked...)  Carpet you should hire out.  Seriously isn't worth DIY. You should go hardwood/laminate anyways!"
DIY,3djgqe,Boneyabba,2,Thu Jul 16 20:02:11 2015 UTC,"I suggest the floor- laminate is cheap, looks good, lasts forever, and is a very satisfying project."
DIY,3djgqe,GFK2K,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:19:12 2015 UTC,"You can do all of those.  I would suggest making a list of what you want to do in what order, based on the stuff you can't stand living with.  I'd wait until last to do the floor so when you're doing all kinds of work you're not screwing your floor up.    If you already have power in the ceiling for other lights, the recessed lights shouldnt be too hard.  that was the first project i did in my place and i didn't really know what i was doing."
DIY,3djgqe,madboater,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:54:02 2015 UTC,"Carpet is an easy job, but even easier to fuck up, it takes one slip when cutting the edges and you brand new carpet looks awful. A lot of places (in UK) do delivery and laying for very little ontop of the carpet, pick your time right you can negotiate it for free. But Laminate is a good cheap option (tip remove the skirting boards and replace). Recessed lighting is simple, just check what is on top of the ceiling before you drill your holes, also check local codes (Part P of UK Building Regs) may limit what you can feasibly do yourself. Solar Tube can be done if you have good weather and the time. Decking is easy, lay a proper base and use the right screws and tools. Bathrooms are more simple than you would think, particularly if you have another one to use. It is always worth having someone with experience to call upon for when it goes wrong."
DIY,3djgqe,cpk1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:54:00 2015 UTC,Replace the carpet - getting rid of the carpet and installing a floating floor is super simple. Recessed lighting is typically simple - if you have drywall and switched lights on the ceiling already then you can do the job in one day if you have attic access. Solar tube - never done much roof work but in theory as long as you get the flashing right you are good. Demo and replace deck - this is also pretty simple and has the advantage of not being annoying to family if the project drags on. Replace vanity - if the sink isn't moving should be super easy. Redo whole bathroom - this could end up being a huge amount with depending on how things look once you open everything up.  Keep in mind that the older the house the more often when you tear into something it will turn into more work due to previous owners/old standards.

Not sure on the shells but a truckload with your own truck of stone is like 35 bucks around me. All materials for this you could keep under $100 i bet.

DIY,3djnd1,DoYouEvenThroCodeBro,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:30:11 2015 UTC,Gorilla glue is too heavy duty for the people we have here doing the work.
DIY,3djnd1,DoYouEvenThroCodeBro,2,Thu Jul 16 20:34:56 2015 UTC,Hmm... rubber cement?
DIY,3djnd1,DoYouEvenThroCodeBro,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:38:46 2015 UTC,"I considered that, how long does it usually take to dry?"
DIY,3djnd1,DoYouEvenThroCodeBro,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:41:34 2015 UTC,"Also, some of the cardboard bases that we need to put in the boxes bow a little and bend and the guy who gave us the product to assemble said that can't happen. So I'm worried that if it takes too long to dry, the bases may not lay flat."
DIY,3djnd1,OSN1,2,Thu Jul 16 20:46:18 2015 UTC,"I think rubber cement dries in about 10-15 mins depending on how thick it's applied, but I haven't used any in a while. Can you apply pressure to the base once you add the glue? Like put a book or something heavy on top so that it doesn't bow and bend?"
DIY,3djnd1,wariotx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:52:53 2015 UTC,"We have about 4,000 boxes we need to assemble, and our clients can produce them pretty quickly, but we don't have the space or resources to weigh down each box =/"
DIY,3djnd1,MercuryCrest,2,Thu Jul 16 20:54:53 2015 UTC,"I think you should be able to avoid the bending with good glue coverage around the edges and middle, and as long as the glue is strong enough. Short of using liquid nails, I think I have exhausted my adhesive knowledge."
DIY,3djnd1,bigolenate,2,Thu Jul 16 21:08:25 2015 UTC,Make sure you are using enough glue. Little dots of glue and light spraying won't do. You may have issues with the glue being absorbed into the material which means you need to find in instant drying method or a dry method.
DIY,3djnd1,MercuryCrest,2,Thu Jul 16 20:34:58 2015 UTC,Double-sided tape should work
DIY,3djnd1,Face999,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:37:39 2015 UTC,"We currently have one gun w/ double sided tape that works well, and we're waiting for more, but we also want to try and produce the product sooner rather than later and the guns wont be here for another 4-5 days."
DIY,3djnd1,ttjr89,2,Thu Jul 16 20:41:04 2015 UTC,"This sounds dumb, but it's cheap and might be worth a shot:  Have you tried using a glue stick? I don't mean just around the edges, I mean all over the bottom.  Just a thought."
DIY,3djnd1,Face999,3,Thu Jul 16 20:54:22 2015 UTC,"yeah, i would've thought a good coat of elmers (or their wood glue) would hold no problem"
DIY,3djnd1,Face999,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:19:01 2015 UTC,"How quickly does wood glue dry? Because we're located in Slc Utah, we have low humidity, therefore the cardboard bases bend a bit, and we need to glue them so they're flat. The guy who gave us the project is being a real dick about everything and isn't helping come up with solutions"
DIY,3djnd1,_clichename,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:13:48 2015 UTC,"I would worry about regular glue making the cardboard ""soggy"".  With a glue stick, it's mostly a gel, making soaking up less likely."
DIY,3djnd1,DoYouEvenThroCodeBro,2,Fri Jul 17 04:49:58 2015 UTC,"Is that just ""normal"" corrugated or wax coated, plastic coated??  All that you mentioned should work on ""normal"".  If it's coated , that's another issue.  Commercial hot melt works pretty damm well.  I have some industrial experience with un-coated.  We'd put 2 stripes about 6"" long on a 12"" piece .  Have you tried a good wood glue?  Dry time could be an issue."
DIY,3djnd1,_clichename,2,Thu Jul 16 21:05:32 2015 UTC,They have quick drying wood glue that dries in about 10 mjns
DIY,3djnd1,iambic_court,2,Thu Jul 16 21:26:31 2015 UTC,"Actually (depending on conditions) any wood glue drys fast, often too fast on corrugated.  Totally different issue - but watered down , I've seen it used for a base/primer for other adhesives.  This was for prototyping or other uses, not production."
DIY,3djnd1,tripedalguy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:23:19 2015 UTC,"It's not just regular cardboard, the boxes are slippery and quite smooth."
