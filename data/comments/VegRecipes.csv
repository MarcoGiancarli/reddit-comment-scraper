VegRecipes,3e42fr,kolipo,9,Tue Jul 21 20:37:34 2015 UTC,I grill tofu. Brush grill with oil. Keep the tofu from sticking by sliding it some till it sets up cooking. Halfway done on the first side turn 45 degrees.(nice grill marks) After the first side is done brush other side with oil and flip. Keep tofu moving till second side sets up. Now I poke holes with a skewer very small holes. Then I start slowly spooning on teriyaki till the second side is done.
VegRecipes,3e42fr,monotoo,7,Tue Jul 21 21:08:29 2015 UTC,"Grilled tofu is great, especially if you're good about adding teriyaki or another sauce as you cook. Also make sure to buy firm/super firm tofu as it's best for grilling."

VegRecipes,3e42fr,stillaredcirca1848,6,Tue Jul 21 23:49:25 2015 UTC,"Some of the things we do that you haven't mentioned are hobo packs; grilled eggplant, squash, and sweet potato; and bbq pulled jackfruit. The hobo packs are parcels of cut up veggies with herbs, seasonings, and olive oil put into tinfoil and sealed. Turn it occasionally and it cooks wonderfully. If you slice eggplant, squash, and sweet potato into thick strips you can grill them right on the grill. You can do this with cauliflower also but I haven't tried it yet. The bbq pulled jackfruit we'll do just like normal but when it calls for it to be put in the oven to crisp I'll drop it into my smoker and let it sit for a while. Also, with the corn on the cob, serve it with Salvadoran crema, chili powder, s&p, and a wedge of lime...elote!"

Grilled potatoes and sweet potatoes are some of my favorite because they're a nice contrast to the usual veggies that end up on the grill for vegetarians.   Also, grilled pineapple is amazing. You can go the simple route or take it up a notch by marinating it in oil/butter, honey and cracked black pepper beforehand. I usually grill it in circular slices, though skewers are great for getting more charred edges. There are a lot of recipes out there, I've yet to go wrong with any of them!"

VegRecipes,3e42fr,loudasthesun,4,Wed Jul 22 00:13:38 2015 UTC,"One of my favourites is Haloumi skewers. Cube the haloumi, and alternate on long skewers with quartered fresh fig, onion, capsicum... whatever. Grill till haloumi is golden and the figs are softened.   Satay tofu skewers are really good too!! Cube up some firm tofu, marinate in satay sauce. Alternate skewers with tofu, pineapple pieces, onion and capsicum. Grill on each side while brushing with satay marinade.   Stuffed portobello mushrooms are always a treat!! get some decently sized portobellos or flat mushrooms (hand sized is good) - remove the stalk and finely chop it with some fresh garlic, top with sliced tomato and basil leaves. wrap them up in some foil to cook mushroom side down for about 7 minutes and then remove them from the foil to char/seal in. You can use the mushroom juice in the foil for a killer gravy.   This takes a bit longer to prep but you can also do vegetable fritters on the BBQ. I like to use a mix of shredded zucchini, shredded sweet potato, corn kernels, some very thinly sliced onion and plenty of flat leaf parsley. Make sure that you get a decent amount of juice out of the shredded veges so you will need to squeeze them in a colander or something. Add egg and fine rice flour, mix well and let sit for about 15 minutes. Grab a small handful, roll into a ball and then squash onto a flat BBQ plate. Cook for about 5 minutes on each side depending on how thick they are. Serve with garlicky tzatziki (cucumber and greek yoghurt)."

VegRecipes,3e1ecm,RumpleCragstan,6,Tue Jul 21 05:24:22 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ mate, you have to pick the week I'm away from my recipe books.  Quiche is a good one, since you can be quite inventive with it. Look up some established recipes;  don't just throw in any old thing. I've got a great recipe for a roquefort quiche, but since you had to pick this bloody week, I can't give you that.  I have no idea what kind of a budget you're on, but I do have my 30 minute meals book with me, and there are a couple of good recipes in there.  Can I interest you in some quinoa with butternut squash?   How about some Linguine alla Genovese?   There's probably a few more in here, and it has options for breakfast,  lunch and dinner.  There should be at least 2 vegetarian meals per section.   Stuffed peppers are a good idea: if I remember correctly,  the one I have includes pine nuts, dried apricots, couscous, feta cheese and spring onion. It's quite classy, and good for a date. The great thing about stuffed peppers is that they can be anything from a swanky, upmarket meal to a mish-mash of leftovers you eat in your underwear in front of Blackadder on an Sunday night (don't judge me; you're the wally that picked this week to go and need vegetarian recipes).   I also hace an absolutely cracking aubergine and halloumi thing that's really quite impressive, but you need to make your own pesto for that. You'd need fresh coriander,  halloumi cheese and a whole mess of other stuff I can't even remember.   Look intp deserts. They're a great way to impress a vegetarian,  since many of them are vegetarian anyway. I don't know if you want to get into this lassie's knickers or not, but a good desert is a great way to leave someone mwith a good impression of the meal they just ate. I don't know how much cooking you do normally,  or what kit you have, but this  recipe has always been a winner for me."

VegRecipes,3e1ecm,Montauket,3,Tue Jul 21 14:35:29 2015 UTC,"A few of my go to semi-impressive vegetarian recipes are shakshuka, cauliflower steak, farro risotto, burrata salad, watermelon-feta-mint salad, and tortilla salad.  Yotam Ottolenghi has a great shakshuka recipe that is easy to find all over the web. Serve it in a rustic pan with some toasted bread and you have a very impressive meal.  Cauliflower steak looks great as well. I like to keep mine simple and usually shy away from heavily spiced versions found online. I just cook it in the pan on medium or a little lower so you get a nice brown color on both sides with the white peeping through. Great side dish and goes well with anything.  Farro risotto with some seasonal root vegetables mixed in, mushrooms, greens on top and a drizzle of yogurt is always nice. I just cook the Farro like normal, add some roasted or sauteed root veg and mushrooms then throw the greens and yogurt on top. Filling and delicious.  Burratta is a mozzarella with cheese curds on the inside and using this in a caprese is a great way to mix-up a classic.  Watermelon-feta-mint salad is a simple as the name implies. Just mix it together and enjoy. Please remember to buy a halved or quartered melon if you don't need a whole one, not something that's been pre-cut into bite size pieces. Those always taste terrible to me.  Fried tortilla salad is a dish I made for the first time just a few days ago. I fried the tortilla with a bit of oil in a pan smaller than the tortilla itself so that sides would be formed by the walls of the pan. Add a nice lettuce mix, goat cheese, diced  cherries or cranberries, some fried tortilla strips, and onion. For that extra mile, make a quick lemon vinaigrette.  Hope y'all have a great time!"

VegRecipes,3e1ecm,ano463s,3,Tue Jul 21 15:44:29 2015 UTC,"This is an older post of mine, but i've tailored it a bit for you and your date  AWESOME DATE DISH  I could list a dozen things that you can make ""in between the commercials"" but since OP is looking for a date-dish I will throw out one of my favorites (it convinced my now-GF that I have serious kitchen skillz)   2lbs of penne pasta (don't get the gluten free shit) 1.5 lbs of mozzrella cheese (the real stuff, not the frozen kind) 1.5-2lbs of baby tomatoes (or grape tomatoes) 1/2-3/4lbs of non-frozen spinach basil garlic cloves olive oil a few knives, cutting-boards very large bowl netflix 2 bottles of wine Any album by queen.   Step 1: Open the bottle of wine. White goes best with this dish, but I'll accept a nice zinfandel, or even a bottle of pinot noir if it's during the winter.  Step 2: Start boiling the water. Remember that you'll need a pretty big pot for this, so account for the noodles.. Add salt if she wants to.  Step 3: Put on the Queen album, and give her a knife. You two are going to be doing some cutting, and will have to do it in a reasonable amount of time if you want the dinner to come together. Wash your tomatoes and slice them in half the ""long"" way. As you cut them, lay them facing up so that you can see their delicious tomato-insides. Once you've sliced them all up, sprinkle some kosher salt on top of them. After this has been done, leave them with the salt while you cut the mozzrella into cubes that are about 3/4 inch on each sides. Playfully stack a tomato/cheese cube and playfully feed it to her. Drink more wine.  Step 4: percision garlic slices. you want 3-4 cloves of garlic, and you want to slice them as paper-thin as humanly possible. Ask if she'd like to try! This will ensure that you are not dating a vampire, and also that she will have a healthy blood-pressure! While she shows off how thin she can slice the garlic (which isn't terribly important - i just like to make a game out of it) you'll want to start melting some butter or olive oil in a sauce-pan. If you've never sauteed spinach before it's not terribly difficult - just keep the heat on low if you're new at it.  Step 5: Take your mozz, tomatoes, a LITTLE bit of diced garlic, basil, and add it to the large mixing bowl. Throw some olive oil into the mix, and stir it gently. Inquire about what her favorite season of THE WIRE is.  Step 6: You have a couple of minutes while the pasta boils, spinach cooks, and you finish the first bottle of wine. Ask her to keep an eye on teh spinach while you set up placemates, forks, , wine glasses, napkins, remote, bong, salt n' pepper up on your living room table. Set up HBO/Netflix so that you'll have it ready  Step 7: strain the pasta, let is sit for a while. This dish can be served warm or cold (and sometimes better cold during summer). slowly add the noodles into the large bowl with your base of tomatoes, mozz, etc.  Step 8: take your chicken off of the pan, and slice it into 1/4 inch slices. Add to the rest of the dish, along with the spinach. Keep stirring as you add more items into teh bowl, because if you don't you'll end up with a whole bunch of pasta on top. top it off with more olive-oil.  Step 8: Enjoy being a vegetarian badass.  Step 9: Let her dig in! she can grab a bowl and head to the couch where you certainly won't be jerking-off alone tonight! Tell her you'll be in in just a minute! Go ahead adn pick something to watch! While she settles in you have to do several things - Rinse out the collander, rinse out the pasta pot, and rinse out the sauce-pan. Since you don't cook much, keep in mind that this is a great time to wash your hands and prevent your date from getting a UTI later on! You've also prevented the issue of ""the dishes"" from popping up later. All you'll need to do is cover the bowl with saran and fridge it!  Step 10: immerge from teh kitchen with a new bottle of wine in hand, pour for the lady, and then for yourself. Unless your date has never had a netflix subscription, she will probably need to spend 10 minutes- 2 hours deciding on what to watch. But since you two are just getting to know one anotehr, you'll probably be okay with re-watching FIREFLY because she's never heard of it.  Step 11: The dishes are clean, you have seconds if you'd like, and despite the fact that your date isn't sure about this TV show that blends cowboys, space pirates, zombies, and such, you're set for the night!"

In a large skillet, heat up oil/butter, then throw in all of the veggies and some of the cajun seasoning and cook until they're to your taste (I like a little crunch, others may like completely mushy).   Reduce heat and stir in heavy cream/half & half.   Add linguine, and mix together.  The sauce will soak into the noodles & veg and reduce the longer you leave it on the heat, so if it's a bit too saucy, just give it a bit more time (normally only happens when you use half & half).  Since we love the cajun seasoning, I normally add more here, but use your taste to guide."

VegRecipes,3e1ecm,duncangeere,2,Tue Jul 21 17:40:16 2015 UTC,"STOP. Do not panic. There is a go-to for great vegetarian (tho not Vegan) food RIGHT at your fingertips -and it does not involve tofu, sprouts or wheatgrass.  Italian food.  A home made Manicotti goes a long way to thrilling diners and there's not a bit of meat in it at all.  1) Make your crepes.  1.5 cup flour  1.5 cup water  6 eggs  Mix that all thoroughly in a pitcher or similar vessel. Get a small frying pan hot on the stove, mist with some olive oil, and pour in the mixture -about a silver-dollar pancake's size dollop. Then roll the pan so it coats the entire bottom thinly. When it bubbles, flip it. In about 30 or so seconds, remove it entirely and make the next crepe. When all the crepes are done you fill them.  2) filling:  1 large container Polly-o Ricotta cheese  1 large block of Polly-o Mozzarella  5 tablespoons black pepper  5 tablespoons dried parsley flakes  1 egg  Mix the egg and the ricotta first, it makes it creamy and easy to mix the rest. Cover the top of the ricotta with pepper (takes about 5 tablespoons) and again with parsley. Mix. Then cube your mozzarella and mix it into the mixture.  That's it! Just fill each crepe with some filling, roll it, and place it seam-side down in an baking dish or big foil lasagna pan that you have coated with some tomato sauce (jarred is fine, try sweet basil flavor from Classico, or whatever your favorite non-meat sauce is). Place each rolled manicotti next to one another, in a single layer. Once the pan is filled, coat the top with more sauce, spreading with the back of a spoon.  3) Bake. about 45 mins on 375. You'll know it's done when you see the sauce bubbling well.  4) Get laid. This isn't a complicated or difficult recipe. it's one of the easiest dishes you'll make. What it is is time consuming so give yourself about 2 hours to prep and then cook it. The home made crepes are what make it indescribably delicious. No pasta shell youve ever had in manicotti will compare ever again. The taste and the notion that you put work into it, is what will win her over.  That and a vegetarian dish that isn't wheat grass vegetarian, but traditional NY Italian home cooking comfort food. It also presents elegantly if you make your plate up nice with it. Best of luck with whatever recipe you end up choosing!  EDIT  also, for a side dish, try these Zucchini Boats -I fill mine with panko, paremsan cheese, a dollop of tomato sauce, white raisins and pine nuts. Sweet, salty and delicious -and I top with more panko and cheese so it crisps in the oven on top."

My understanding of it (and someone may way to correct me here) is that there are 4 types of proteins in milk, one of which stops it from curdling. The rennet binds to this specific protein, and allows the milk to curdle. So the rennet winds up in the whey."

VegRecipes,3d8fpn,dibblah,2,Tue Jul 14 19:20:47 2015 UTC,Don't ever use canned chickpeas when making falafel. It makes the dough too wet and your falafel will fall apart. Always use chickpeas that have been soaked for 8-12 hours. I had too many failed falafel using canned.

Even if you sub the meat broth with a veggie broth, you're not going to get the parmesan cheese if you veganize. You got to consider what the recipe is using as the source of umami, in this case its using a combination of broth and parmesan to build the backbone (so to speak) of the risotto. So you'll have to duplicate to get the richness. If I were making it, I would start the dish by sauteing sliced mushrooms in a bit of olive oil, cooked on pretty high heat for about 30 minutes. As the water in the mushrooms cook off and they become dry, add a bit of soy sauce to the pan and stir in the mushrooms, really letting them brown, then do the same with a red wine to de-glaze. Get all the bits scraped off the pan, and then you can just make the risotto there in that pan. So what just happened is that we created a layer of three sources of umami (mushrooms, soy sauce, and red wine) to the dish to make up for the absence of a major source of umami in the original (the parmesan cheese)."

If coming off a 70 mile bike ride, or a marathon, or a climb up Mt. Whitney, there may be some protein / fat cravings (taken care of with eggs, chocolate milk, grilled cheese sandwiches, etc.).

VegRecipes,3cjtn7,time_again,2,Wed Jul 8 22:09:11 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear it. I am such of fan of that cook book. We're avid cooks and cook book collectors, and no other book gets as much action as that book does in our kitchen. The only problem with it is that all the recipes are really geared at making a special meal: they're not necessarily cheap or easy. It's fault is its strength, because each thing I make from it is restaurant quality.  Like I said before, I can help you choose something to make, just let me know. I would highly advise against making something from the internet without trying it first, because you just never really know (and I love using internet recipes). I just find it a bit of a gamble. If you do, try and make sure its coming from a well known book or magazine (or even a well known blog).   Off the top of my head I'd say make the mushroom and tofu quiche. This is my go-to for potlucks. It goes quickly, people absolutely love it, and they'll only know its tofu if you tell them. This is seriously good eats, but give yourself time (three hours or so) to prepare and bake it. If you live in a hot place, you may want to make something that's not baked and has more fresh/raw ingredients because they tend to be more cooling.  Like /u/cwanda says above, don't miss the small things. You must have good drinks (not all alcohol). Sparkling water with fresh sliced lime or lemons is easy and cheap and makes the meal. Its seriously nice. You can get a few bottles of regular old sparkling water, they're usually sub $1 for a bottle. You don't need imported mineral water, because you'll be adding the fresh citrus at the table. They also mentioned an interesting salad. Yes to this, something really easy like throwing in blueberries or sliced strawberries is a HUGE upgrade and pretty nice and cheap this time of year. This summer I've been really into fruit salad and a bar of chocolate for desserts. No one is going to complain you didn't make something more complicated, and it fits the summer to a t. Try and get everything cooked or at least prepped before hand. Plan to take a shower after cooking, so factor that in. Good luck! Remember, have coffee and easy breakfast ingredients on hand just in case (vegan pancakes are pretty easy, serve with real maple syrup and a frozen fruit compote--a bag of frozen fruit dumped into a small sauce pan with a bit of water and a lid on low heat before you start pancakes--are really easy).   *Edit: sorry for being heteronormative and calling you a dude. I'm sorry."

So I have to kind of bring it picnic style or all prepped! Hopefully I can pull it off. I really appreciate all your help!"
VegRecipes,3cjtn7,Scroachity,2,Thu Jul 9 15:42:03 2015 UTC,"I can't recommend the quiche enough, and it is great for transport. You could pull it out of the oven and head over, or cook it way ahead of time and reheat there. Have fun!"
VegRecipes,3cjtn7,neovox,3,Thu Jul 9 18:47:17 2015 UTC,"Risotto (mentioned above) is a GREAT idea in terms of taste, but it does require constant attention, which has it downsides when you are trying to entertain.   http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/eggplant-with-buttermilk-sauce-365110  Delicious, simple, inexpensive, and unbelievably good. I have convinced SEVERAL people who hate eggplants that they were in fact wrong about that. Basically anything from Ottolenghi's cookbooks will be stupidly good and mostly easy (but not taste like it).   http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/yellow-gazpacho-243271  Gazpacho recipe if tomatoes are coming in season where you are. It calls for yellow tomatoes, but red will work too. (I do prefer the yellow for their lower acidity).   http://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/food/vegetarian-tacos  Lentil Tacos - not fancy, but delicious. And a safe bet as pretty much everyone likes tex-mex. Plus, I've served this to people who ""don't eat vegetarian food"" and they were licking their plates.   EDIT: http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/feb/02/recipe.vegetarian  Leek Fritters! (Forgot earlier) They are also super tasty, very unusual and seem very impressive. The recipe may be able to be tweeked so the batter and sauce can be prepared ahead, and then you would just have to fry them when she comes over. Serve with a BIG salad and some roast veggies."
VegRecipes,3chywx,froggyjamboree,20,Wed Jul 8 01:31:23 2015 UTC,"I wondered this for years and I finally achieved the texture at home! It comes from freezing the tofu, defrosting and then frying!"
VegRecipes,3chywx,iatesugarray,6,Wed Jul 8 01:32:58 2015 UTC,do you squeeze the water out before or after freezing?
VegRecipes,3chywx,catatronic,8,Wed Jul 8 02:43:17 2015 UTC,After!
VegRecipes,3chywx,iatesugarray,2,Wed Jul 8 02:44:25 2015 UTC,do you dry it off before frying ? dust it in flour ? what size do you cut your tofu before frying ? thanks !
VegRecipes,3chywx,bassface69,2,Wed Jul 8 13:21:43 2015 UTC,I'm not /u/iatesugarray but I freeze my tofu and then press it.  It expels a lot of liquid and is then ready to soak up any marinade.  I think it also improves the texture.  I dust mine in a mix of corn starch and flour (if pan frying) or just bake it as is.
VegRecipes,3chywx,durianno,3,Wed Jul 8 14:53:37 2015 UTC,"This is my new favorite technique for sure, especially with firm or extra firm tofu."
VegRecipes,3chywx,carlaacat,2,Wed Jul 8 01:55:48 2015 UTC,I was wondering if that was it! I'll have to give it a try. Thx.

VegRecipes,3chywx,skindoom,7,Wed Jul 8 04:46:45 2015 UTC,"The freezing method is a decent method if you cannot get good/fresh tofu, but for me it ruins the taste of fresh tofu. Fresh tofu has an almost creamy flavor to it. If you cannot get it fresh try to find a close Asian market like super H-mart. The tofu in normal grocery stores sits there for a while (gets a weird slimy texture), but in Asian markets it sells fast and is usually restocked weekly.  If you're doing anything other than using the tofu in a soup you need to properly dry it, and precook it. Slice the tofu up in the sizes you want and let it dry on something that will absorb the moisture. A trick I learned to help dry it and flavor it at the same time is to bring some salt water to boil, turn it off, and soak the tofu in the salt water for about 5-10 minutes.  This obviously salts the tofu but it also helps in the drying process. I dry and press the tofu slices for 30-45 minutes. Finally on high heat using a skillet or a thick pan, brown each side for a couple of minutes.  At this point the tofu is ready to be used. Season it, glaze it or use it as is. Stir fry it, bake it, or grill it."

VegRecipes,3c7s3b,amuseyourbouche,6,Sun Jul 5 18:19:07 2015 UTC,"This is way too healthy to be a real Costa Rican breakfast. You have to fry up red bell pepper and an onion in some oil, then add the rice and beans (don't forget the bean juice). Top with cilantro, sour cream and even Lizano if you are going full Costa Rican.   EDIT: Costa Rica is an amazing place to go if you like to cook for yourself, but if you want to eat out a lot it is very hard as a vegetarian and you will be eating a LOT of the above meal.  Oh, and be sure to let your plantains get mostly black for the best flavor"
VegRecipes,3c7s3b,charzhazha,3,Sun Jul 5 23:36:14 2015 UTC,"I spent a month in Costa Rica 2y ago and I still miss gallo pinto - yours sounds much more like what I had than the white rice and black beans from Joy the Baker. I really should try making it again, I even have the Lizano in the cupboard (bought two bottles to bring back with me).  I just wish we could buy plantains here! For Cuban platanos as well as planatos fritos (and for the latter I agree, needs to be fully ripe before cooking, sliced lengthways and cooked to be almost caramalised).  Re: vegetarianism - I agree, there is very few veggie options that I found. Even less recommended is Cuba - I don't think it would be possible to be vegetarian there (there's only 7 vegetables and meat is a BIG part of the diet/culture)"
VegRecipes,3c7s3b,kochipoik,2,Mon Jul 6 07:43:07 2015 UTC,"It depends where you are, on the Caribbean coast and in San Jose there are lots of vegetarian and vegan places to eat. On the other coast much less so admittedly but there are still gems all over the place. Vegan, vegetarian, healthy, and ethical food is rapidly becoming fashionable and more popular."
VegRecipes,3c7s3b,garamasala,3,Mon Jul 6 03:09:44 2015 UTC,"Travelled Central America for a few weeks last summer and loved the food, especially  the desayuno typico sort of breakfasts. The salsas are so so good, chop some tomatoes, red onion and fresh coriander and then drown that in lime juice and it kind of tastes the same."
