tacobell,3e4nc3,axcobb,4,Tue Jul 21 22:42:01 2015 UTC,This is why stores are out. Hoarding.
tacobell,3e4nc3,SnackeyG1,0,Tue Jul 21 23:52:53 2015 UTC,If it wasn't a limited time sauce the people who really like it wouldn't have to hoard it. I started collecting as soon as it came out and I found out I loved it. Most trips I only had like 3 or 4 extra but I got a few good hookups of like 20 a couple of times.

tacobell,3e0747,Ivota,2,Wed Jul 22 04:37:18 2015 UTC,I really hate those potato burritos. It just makes the interiors of the burrito into mush throughout. There is no texture difference. Absolutely disgusting.  Don't get me wrong. I love cheesy fiesta potatoes. When they are in a bowl away from the burrito you still get the crunchy/oily/salty exterior contrasted with the light fluffy interiors... then covered in cheese. Yum.

tacobell,3e178k,papertigers,3,Tue Jul 21 04:12:53 2015 UTC,They were $1 when the first came out then they raised up to $1.50 slowly. They use to be a $1 in the happy hour time period but they stopped doing that as well now. Sucks because I really like them but I didn't order them as much after they got rid of the Buffalo Chicken one.
tacobell,3e178k,ChiefsFan435,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:03:54 2015 UTC,I haven't ordered one in a while but I remember when I did get one in the not to distant past. The lady in the drive thru made it a point to tell me that all grillers had gone up in price and were no longer a dollar.
tacobell,3e178k,ghstbstr20,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:37:05 2015 UTC,"They're $1.89 near me. :/  I never order them outside of Happier Hour, but it still kinda sucks."
tacobell,3e178k,WhoseRiverIsItAnyway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:52:35 2015 UTC,"See, it is wierd. At my location, they have always been $1. Thry other grillers are $1.59. It makes it awkward because one the menu they group the grillers in one section under the drinks, with only 1 space to put a price. Its a grey box and underneath it says ""each"" even though they are priced differently. So, when I do POP I tend to put price pockets under each griller and insert price it accordingly. Even though the background is darker, it is readable. If your store does had different prices for each griller, I would recommend it. Management seems to not have a problem with it as it is technically Archway's fault for assuming all grillers are the same price.  Perhaps GMs and RGMs can request that Archway adds additional grey boxes for the grillers."

There are dicks sometimes, but these people are a different level of dicks. If they refused to leave (and one did once), I called my town's non-emergency line and had a police officer remove said patrons from my drive thru.  Yep, got a bad review once and a while from this, but being on a first name basis with the franchise owner and getting lots of good reviews during the rest of the time helps.

tacobell,3dx2az,uberguby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:27:15 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the 21st century culture of entitlement that is infecting at least 65-75% of the world's population (+/- 10% for margin of error). Demanding, rude, and expecting perfection all the time and every time. These people are the reason why retail, food service, and any other position that involves waiting on people to some degree, are broken and don't smile very much.  As someone who is a cashier at their employer, I totally understand why today's workers don't enjoy going into work, especially when their job may not be providing enough for them to make ends meet, regardless of other circumstances.   It is posts like this one here that still show that there are others like the OP out there who understand, empathize, and generally give a shit about treating others as they would want to be treated. These are the people that get the best customer service. Since I am a cashier, and I love Taco Bell more than anyone else I know, I always try to be a pleasant person whenever I go grocery shopping, out to eat, etc. When I do have a problem with the service or an issue, I calmly, but firmly express my opinion/dissent/dissatisfaction in as an adult of a manner as possible. Never do I raise my voice in a manner that is hostile, or throw a fit like a child.  Until there comes a day when businesses stop giving in to people like the bitch in question and shutting them down and refusing to serve them that this epic level clusterfuck is going to continue.  It would also say that modern parenting where ""my son/daughter is a special snowflake"" could also be added here, but now is not the time nor place for that discussion."

(this coming from the guy with the top voted comment on this thread. I'm not against you I just simply wish to be the devil's advocate here.)  When I go anywhere, I expect what I pay for to be up to par with my expectations (aka ""perfect"" in my opinion). If I ask for no sour cream on my 5-layer, and it comes with sour cream, it is my expectation that it is corrected. NOW there ARE correct and non correct ways to have such an issue corrected. For me, I just walk up, explain the issue kindly and ask to have it corrected. Not dramatic, not over the top, just ""hey a mistake was made and it would be cool if you can fix this please"".  I used to manage a competing quick service restaurant. People fuck up sometimes, I accept that. I love the customers that just are, ""hey my burger has onions on it"", so I can be ""oh shit sorry man let me get that remade for you, and btw you can keep the wrong one, its on me"". Easy and simple.  There is nothing wrong with spending your money and expecting something the way you want it.

tacobell,3dxmcq,astilwell,3,Mon Jul 20 22:30:52 2015 UTC,I love to get mine with grilled chicken and creamy jalapeÃ±o sauce.. Recommended it to a few other customers and they liked it too :)

tacobell,3dxmcq,Atelisi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:05:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly I was so put off by the quesarito the first time I had it, and it wasn't until I had the mini quesadilla until I knew what the culprit was. It's that vile, putrid chipotle sauce. Anything with it just tastes downright bad"

tacobell,3dw2st,roto_disc,8,Mon Jul 20 00:47:04 2015 UTC,Do the numbers correspond with the months of the year? Like is Experience 9 September and does it only last the one month?
tacobell,3dw2st,WhoseRiverIsItAnyway,3,Mon Jul 20 02:37:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, each month has different promotions."

tacobell,3dw2st,bag_of_oatmeal,4,Mon Jul 20 03:49:00 2015 UTC,"""The only pressure we have... is from the consumer. The consumer evolves, and the consumer changes, and as long as you are listening to that consumer, then you shouldn't feel pressure from other people... because if I'm doing right by the consumer then it's going to work."" - Chris Brandt, Chief Marketing Officer.   Too much to ask for? It's a burrito with Frito Chips that they ALREADY have permanently, but with the specific Frito Chips that started off their whole recent Frito-Lays partnership that has helped shape the company they are today. When they are bringing back Volcano Sauce, and are planning on making TWO Frito Tacos and more Frito Burritos, then no... we are not asking for too much."
tacobell,3dw2st,Beefycrunchmovement,2,Mon Jul 20 04:48:02 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have the chili-cheese burrito available again.  Yes, I realize that it is available in a (VERY) small percentage of TBs at a few locations in the country."
tacobell,3dw2st,chrismichaels3000,2,Tue Jul 21 02:20:43 2015 UTC,I can't imagine not having the CCB.  It's available at every taco bell I go to and I'd rather have that than anything else!!
tacobell,3dw2st,columbus5kwalkandrun,5,Tue Jul 21 14:10:53 2015 UTC,Just the sauce? Not the items?

tacobell,3dw2st,onitsuka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:22:40 2015 UTC,Is it just the sauce? Or are there specialty items featuring the sauce? A new or returning Volcano Menu? Any reason or fanfare behind the return? Popular Demand?

tacobell,3dw2st,Loch_ness_Monster350,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:07:50 2015 UTC,YES!!!!!!!! How do we make it a permanent item instead of just limited time?
tacobell,3dw2st,ChiefsFan435,2,Mon Jul 20 14:07:45 2015 UTC,depends on how well it does
tacobell,3dw2st,Hyper_Rational,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:26:23 2015 UTC,Well I will do my part and get a Volcano Burrito at least once a day.
tacobell,3dw2st,TheKanten,4,Mon Jul 20 16:31:05 2015 UTC,I'll live off of Volcano Nacho's until the promotion ended if it meant to get Lava sauce back permanently.

tacobell,3dx0ji,redblackjoker,9,Mon Jul 20 06:06:19 2015 UTC,Ya got anything for us other than some pictures of a half eaten burrito?
tacobell,3dx0ji,sixcylinders,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:32:25 2015 UTC,There's really nothing different besides the chips and sauce that goes into it. The diablo sauce packets were hotter than the habanero sauce.
tacobell,3dx0ji,olivecrayon87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:20:26 2015 UTC,So someone broke the street date on Dare Devil Grillers? Fantastic. I bet that was the last Habanero Griller they served that day.
tacobell,3dvaqa,WhoseRiverIsItAnyway,3,Sun Jul 19 20:37:27 2015 UTC,Mac n' Cheese!
tacobell,3dvaqa,Penguin_Pinch,2,Sun Jul 19 21:26:54 2015 UTC,Everything. Personally I have only collected substantial amounts of limited time sauces. My diablo collection is somewhere around 175-200 packets now I believe. I just save them though for once the sauce is no longer available and use them on taco bell products. Maybe occasionally if I make something Mexican at home.
tacobell,3dvaqa,axcobb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:07:00 2015 UTC,Steamed broccoli & carrots. I like fire & verde best.

tacobell,3dspul,TeemoSpeeed,12,Sun Jul 19 02:19:48 2015 UTC,yeah its in the new experience dare devil grillers  or something
tacobell,3dspul,Hall_ryan21,3,Sun Jul 19 02:36:28 2015 UTC,I thought the promo ended two months ago or so? Is it coming back?
tacobell,3dspul,hiero_,3,Sun Jul 19 04:09:30 2015 UTC,"Were you near Cincinnati? If so, yeah you were a test-market. It looks like it's going Nationwide in a few weeks."
tacobell,3dspul,Beefycrunchmovement,2,Sun Jul 19 06:06:34 2015 UTC,"I am. I had absolutely no idea! I know that Cincinnati is occasionally a test market which is awesome but I had no idea we were for that specific promo. I'm glad it's coming back, I really love them and I hope they keep them for a while."
tacobell,3dspul,hiero_,3,Sun Jul 19 06:14:44 2015 UTC,"Well you're lucky! Luckily for you the only new ingredient is the ""sauce"" so there's a good chance it could stay a while if not permanently. I say luckily only because the Beefy Crunch has the Mexican Rice AND the Flamin' Hot Fritos which is a much harder battle to have on their menu. However, I do look forward to trying these Dare Devil stuff when it goes national. :)"
tacobell,3dspul,Beefycrunchmovement,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:15:11 2015 UTC,you were probably in a test market

tacobell,3dspul,Purpstm,3,Sun Jul 19 04:39:05 2015 UTC,Nope. No back brace for me. Id love one though.
tacobell,3dspul,sixcylinders,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:17:36 2015 UTC,back brace?? i did truck for 2 years as a crew and then a year as a manager at Wendy's and never saw me a back brace.
tacobell,3dspul,Purpstm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:04:18 2015 UTC,"How's your back? The guy who trained me for truck would always have it on so I don't wanna risk it, you know?"
tacobell,3dspul,sixcylinders,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:17:40 2015 UTC,Not bad at all honestly but I was (am) young so maybe I could just handle it
tacobell,3dspul,Beefycrunchmovement,3,Sun Jul 19 05:21:53 2015 UTC,What Hall_ryan21 said. It's the Dare Devil Grillers promotion.

tacobell,3drtja,hiero_,3,Sun Jul 19 06:15:59 2015 UTC,Just brought one of these home for my mom. She loved it!
tacobell,3drtja,TeemoSpeeed,2,Sun Jul 19 07:19:35 2015 UTC,"You made me order one. The pizza was much better, but I'd say I can go without the guac. Kinda threw the flavor off a bit."
tacobell,3drtja,LordKwik,2,Sun Jul 19 15:07:10 2015 UTC,Maybe a little avocado ranch instead?
