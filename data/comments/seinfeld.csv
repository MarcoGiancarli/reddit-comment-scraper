seinfeld,3e33ty,felinebeeline,5,Tue Jul 21 17:34:50 2015 UTC,"x-post from /r/seinfeldgifs - Season 9, Episode 9 ""The Apology""  Jerry's plot from the episode:   Jerry begins dating Melissa (Kathleen McClellan), a woman who is comfortable being naked in his apartment in nonsexual contexts. She walks naked into the kitchen to eat waffles and is also naked while playing board games. While George is envious, Jerry soon grows uncomfortable with Melissa's quirk. He finds her unattractive when she does anything naked that involves her muscles contracting. Eventually, Jerry tries casual nudity himself, but Melissa does not support male nudity (""bad naked""). Elaine later explains that the female body is art while the male body is just utility. Ultimately Jerry convinces Melissa to wear clothes more often, but regrets his decision when he can not stop thinking about how good she looks naked. Unfortunately Melissa can not stop thinking of how bad Jerry looks naked, and the relationship is ruined. [Check the episode's wiki for the other character's plots.]"

seinfeld,3dxv5l,Kadaj2302,3,Tue Jul 21 13:12:01 2015 UTC,The only one I've ever heard was Christopher Lloyd's character from Taxi being possible inspiration.
seinfeld,3dxv5l,Hemansno1fan,11,Mon Jul 20 18:24:58 2015 UTC,Kramer was directly inspired by Larry David's old neighbor Kenny Kramer.
seinfeld,3dxv5l,GeorgeAmberson,15,Mon Jul 20 20:42:02 2015 UTC,"They actual parody Kenny Kramer's reaction to the character in numerous episodes.   Michael Richards did not want to meet with Kenny to study the character and wanted to create the character himself. This situation was later parodied in the Seinfeld fourth season episode ""The Pilot"". The character was originally going to be named ""Kessler"" (parodied when he and Jerry are shown meeting for the first time in ""The Betrayal""), due to Larry David's fear that using the name might spur the real Kramer to exploit his association with the character. However, Jerry Seinfeld thought that the name was too good not to use. Kenny Kramer then proceeded to contact Castle Rock Entertainment with a list of several demands, many of which were financial, for the use of his name. One demand not met was that Kenny would get to play Kramer, which is also parodied in ""The Pilot"".  Kenny has been the host of Kramer's Reality Tour and Kramer's Reality Road Show for the past 13 years. He tells behind-the-scene Seinfeld stories to his audience and gives a bus tour of sites made famous by Seinfeld. A DVD version of his reality tour has been produced. The ""Reality Tours"" were later parodied on Seinfeld in the episode ""The Muffin Tops"", when the Kramer character receives money from catalog sales company owner J. Peterman for the use of his various stories in Peterman's biography. He develops a reality bus tour and touts himself as ""The Real J. Peterman."" The relationship between Cosmo Kramer and Kenny Kramer is explored in the featurette ""Kramer vs. Kramer: Kenny to Cosmo"", on the 3rd season Seinfeld DVD."

seinfeld,3e2s2r,Denarious,2,Tue Jul 21 15:46:11 2015 UTC,"OK I can't remember for sure either but seems to me like if you swapped jerry and George's role in your description then that's the scene.  Like Elaine is talking to George while jerry is reading, jerry and Elaine agree some boyfriend's behavior is a big deal and George doesn't get it.  I think anyways"
seinfeld,3e2s2r,jpGrind,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:27:03 2015 UTC,See the other answer. You're both right. The situation is reversed. George is trying to get Elaine to use her influence to stop him reporting him for peeing in the shower. She says she has no influence because he was wiped her bottle before drinking it. George blows it off but Jerry says it is a deal breaker.

seinfeld,3db6s3,casher7,4,Wed Jul 15 18:52:14 2015 UTC,It was twice I believe. The first time was when her and Jerry were putting their finger in each others faces and kramer said they were in love with each other.
