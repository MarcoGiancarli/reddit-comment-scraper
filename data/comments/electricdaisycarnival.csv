electricdaisycarnival,3dwybc,annoyingly_obvious,-11,Mon Jul 20 05:39:17 2015 UTC,The fact that it's a blow up is pretty cheap of insomniac. ..they really cut corners with the main stage this year.
electricdaisycarnival,3dwybc,berasok,6,Mon Jul 20 15:44:19 2015 UTC,What difference would it make to you if it was made out of metal or wood? I had no clue it was a blow up until I saw this picture. The whole stage was an illusion. That's the point. They did a pretty good job of making this blow up balloon look realistic in my opinion.
electricdaisycarnival,3dwybc,DPDragon,4,Mon Jul 20 16:20:53 2015 UTC,"The Owls on kinetic last year were also inflatable, and same with the Buddha art installation. You'd never know unless you saw it close up like in the photo. Art is an illusion, and they do it well."

I had my brother and some amazing friends (especially one who took me to my first EDC and introduced me to trance) under our Trance Camp totem. Everyone was so happy, dancing, light shows, trading kandi, making new friends, just everything.   There was one point I just stopped and looked around and saw all my friends together at my favorite place with my favorite music. I've never been happier and will never forget that moment."

I've already rented a house for next year so I'm really hoping that June 16-21st will be good. Usually we rent right after the dates are announced but a lot of places jack up the price for that weekend. We really like having a house because we can buy groceries and cook and have a pool/ hot tub 24hrs a day. Edit: month cuz i wasn't thinking"

electricdaisycarnival,3dkcj9,vanilli,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:34:23 2015 UTC,"If you're looking to save money, renting a house on airbnb is a good alternative option. Me and my friends rented a house for 5, $200 a person. The great thing about it was that it was 5 minutes away from the airport and 10 minutes away from the Strip. Also, airbnb mandates their listers to include basic household necessities in their homes, such as, toothpaste, toothbrushes, towels, forks, etc. So that was a BIG plus in saving money. But my advice is, book the house early. And by early I mean January, mid-February latest. We could've had a real nice house with a pool and everything for the same price listed above had it not been for my friends indecisiveness. Nevertheless, it's a good experience imo. Just do your research on whether or not the house is a inconvenience enroute to your destinations. Hope this helps."
electricdaisycarnival,3dkcj9,gtjk89,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:36:11 2015 UTC,"Be careful and BOOK A HOTEL ON BACKUP. Booking this early results in a lot of reservations getting cancelled. People realize it's EDC and they don't want their house wrecked (which is going to happen more now with all the news of AirBnB houses getting destroyed) or they can charge more. Out of about 8 friends who've booked houses, only 2 haven't got their reservations cancelled on them, and one of those was 2 days before EDC.  On the note ""too pricey like hotels"" - funny you say that, I've never been to another city with hotels as cheap as Vegas, we stay on the strip for 8 days for under 600 bucks every year. That's 150 a person with 4 people. DIRT cheap."
electricdaisycarnival,3dkcj9,edcRachel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:08:20 2015 UTC,This year we booked a condo through airbnb and it was so worth it. I would highly recommend to do it we paid $800 which was cheaper than most hotels plus having a kitchen to cook food saved us plenty of money. We didn't have to sign any contract the only thing they said was just not to be loud which was totally cool with us.
electricdaisycarnival,3dkcj9,emoney23,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:09:49 2015 UTC,"Another thing to potentially look into might be one of the bigger suite hotels on the strip - I stayed at the Palazzo Thurs-Mon and it only came out to 170/p for 7 people, and we all slept comfortably (two queen beds, pull out sofa bed, other side of the L-shaped sofa, and then a guy on the two cushions removed from the sofa to pull out the bed)"

There may be a chance some foreigners will get in trouble with controlled substances during this. It will make or break this event, especially how insane japan's drug laws are."
electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,UnicornMcGee,5,Thu Jul 16 16:17:29 2015 UTC,"As a big fan of some good ol' controlled substances... not risking it. If I go to this (I want to) I'm not even going to risk trying to bring or find anything in Japan. I'll just get shitfaced, lol.   Not only are the laws intense, but culturally Japan is very scared of drugs. We had a Japanese penpal get quite worried when she found out we regularly smoke weed, which is of course almost a boring occurrence in SoCal at this point. But point is, this is a host country, as visitors we're guests, and NOT coming across as a bunch of high wild people is both the polite thing to do AND get edc invited back the following year."
electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,TrampTookTooMuch,2,Thu Jul 16 16:52:23 2015 UTC,"Someone I know recently traveled there and had no problem taking things in. small amounts, but still, enough for several people for several days."

electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,DPDragon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:58:47 2015 UTC,Japan is ridiculous about their drug laws.  I'm gonna have to make some Yakuza friends before the event.
electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,davivi,10,Thu Jul 16 16:31:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to sound stuck up but I think all of these new EDC's are going to dilute the brand. EDC is awesome but branching out in New York, Chicago, Mexico, PR, Orlando, England, Brazil, and now Japan? I know there is money to be made but it just doesn't feel right to me. It's like EDC is turning into Ultra."
electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,berasok,14,Thu Jul 16 14:50:25 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that everyone still believes EDC is the underground movement, which in a way it is. There are still people out there who have never heard of EDC. But with how dance music is saturated in the mainstream and how largely promoted these events on (Remember the ads in the airports and on the taxi cabs?) EDC is no longer a secret. Thankfully though, EDC still holds onto it's magic and creativity and promotes positive vibes and love, rather than Ultra just for ""raging"""
electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,DJRonin,3,Thu Jul 16 15:16:47 2015 UTC,"It's been the largest music festival in the world for several years, it hasn't been a secret."

electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,Stuffiness,7,Thu Jul 16 16:07:06 2015 UTC,"""dilute the brand"" is such a fuzzy, esoteric thing though. How exactly would it change? How does a party in Japan effect the big one in Vegas?"
electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,laytonskywalker,3,Thu Jul 16 15:00:35 2015 UTC,I agree. I think the world is realizing EDC is unlike any other festival and want to bring their experience everywhere
electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,yukatluna,3,Thu Jul 16 15:09:57 2015 UTC,"Actually it's not only Insomniac decided to have EDC in Japan. A friend of mine knows this Japanese company which reached out to Insomniac to make EDC JAPAN happen. Music festivals are blooming everywhere in the world as well as in Japan. Festivals like Ultra, Sensation and ezoo has already arrived and I was not surprised at EDC JAPAN after all."
electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,ohThisUsername,3,Thu Jul 16 18:44:52 2015 UTC,"I see where you are coming from, but we all know EDC Las Vegas is the EDC.   As long as Insomniac isn't compromising the EDCLV experience to put on these international events (Which they almost certainly aren't), I don't see a problem with it. I am a little disappointed that the EDCLV hype gets a bit drowned out by all of the other events, but I know that the EDCLV experience will continue to blow any of the other events out of the water."
electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,thedolaon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:45:26 2015 UTC,The world is getting smaller and there are still markets for people to experience EDC. There is nothing wrong with this in my opinion.
electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,madmorph,3,Mon Jul 20 17:53:21 2015 UTC,This sounds like an awesome experience. itd be more of a trip to japan with an edc thrown in there versus edc in Japan for me though...need more details. definitely gotta start saving now though.
electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,laytonskywalker,3,Thu Jul 16 18:42:23 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I'd do, especially since I suspect this is gonna be like other regional EDCs and be a 1-day event that starts earlier.  I've got a ton of Facebook friends who are weeaboos first, EDM fans second, and they saw this and got excited. (Which is good since a group would be more fun and better to split costs)"
electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,Cronny420,6,Thu Jul 16 18:52:02 2015 UTC,This is the greatest thing ever! Insomniac is the best!
electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,cringina,2,Thu Jul 16 07:05:25 2015 UTC,So now that stages are being re used for other edc around the world are tickets prices going to drop because they are making so much money off them ?
electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,djbayko,12,Thu Jul 16 06:09:44 2015 UTC,"No, prices are they way the are because of the resources they have to offer headliners. They charge a different price per edc location according to what they are providing for us. EDC Las Vegas will always be as expensive or more because it's the best and most dynamic. Prices will only continue to rise for edclv because of the new tax laws and the continuous crowd increase. Edc Japan and UK and Puerto Rico, etc., don't have as much to offer and thus will stay the same. Just because there is more edc's doesn't cause the price to decrease. Ticket prices are based on revenue to spending scales."
electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,Nexus_Cannon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:05:19 2015 UTC,"It's not that simple.  The fact is that stage design and construction is a cost for EDC, and distributing that cost across more events should have an impact, however slight.  At the same time, there are so many other factors that go into ticket pricing (e.g. the new tax, forecasted demand) that you won't be able to look at the 2016 prices and conclusively say what effect stage reuse efficiency or any other factor had on the final amount unless you have inside information."
electricdaisycarnival,3dh5ip,TweetPoster,2,Thu Jul 16 14:31:36 2015 UTC,The cost of a show is ~50% labor.
