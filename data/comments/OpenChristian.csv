OpenChristian,3e1djq,jdliberty2015,4,Tue Jul 21 05:16:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a specific definition of ""progressive christianity,"" it's more of a signifier people use to show that they pursue justice and equality for all while identifying as a christian of one kind or another. People in many different denominations, or people who don't belong to any church, might call themselves progressive christians although their belief systems might be very different from each other. Like you, I have some pretty orthodox doctrine in my bag (the Trinity, for one) and I'm also a raging feminist and gsm ally. I consider myself a progressive christian."
OpenChristian,3e1djq,invisiblecows,3,Tue Jul 21 07:22:42 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why I really don't like using progressive/liberal/conservative outside of a political context.  And even within a political context it tends to encourage lazy speech instead of good discussion.  I generally refer to your views on the Trinity, etc (the creed stuff) as ""orthodox"", and would be a term I'd be comfortable using to describe both of us.  (To answer your question: I dunno if you're a ""progressive Christian"" or if the term implies a big umbrella, and I don't know that there's any particular authority on those questions.  I think you're right, though, and I'd be happy to see you and others like you here and everywhere.)"
OpenChristian,3e1djq,EACCES,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:44:36 2015 UTC,Progressive = Progress  Which means that a Progressive Christian is one that adapts to modern times or new ideals.

OpenChristian,3dufr3,wekillpeoplewithguns,4,Sun Jul 19 16:12:24 2015 UTC,This is how I look at the Bible  History of Hebrews: Basically the Old Testament which should only be looked at from a historic point of view.  Gospel of Jesus: Teachings of Jesus which is the Law but should be reviewed for cultural and historical context. I find this to be great for applying to our individual self.  Gospel of the Disciples: Teaching of the Disciples which can be their own personal opinion or interpretation of Jesus' teachings. Readers should be careful not to confuse personal opinion with what Jesus said. Cultural and historical context needs to be reviewed as well in this case. I find this great for showing how a group should act.
OpenChristian,3dufr3,Zaneran,4,Sun Jul 19 17:03:29 2015 UTC,"We have often seen the Bible as a book of answers. If you have a question you're encouraged to open it and find out ""what God has to say.""  This in my opinion is a really bad idea. I read the Bible and teach my congregation to read the Bible as a book of questions. When we read scripture we are invited into a conversation, and we are formed to ask the right questions. It's a lifelong effort."

My own personal history and commitments shape how I read the Bible.   I grew up Evangelical, so I have a fairly strong knowledge of and respect for the text, and I appeal to it quite often (which can set me apart in some progressive circles). A strong historical-critical understanding of the text is also therefore important to me (and because I've just had a really nerdy education), and I try to get a feel of the mainstream scholarly landscape as a base for my understanding.   Then I think I can start reading the text in allegorical or other modes that are faithful to the other theological commitments I have, e.g. radical theology, liberation theology, queer theology, etc. But, of course, there are other times when I don't approach the text in such a heady manner, in poetry, song, liturgy, etc. Balancing these beneficial uses with my intellectual commitments can be tough sometimes though."

He's straight, and he's got great resources for further reading and following Biblical arguments deeper than any other.  Andrew Marin ""Love is an Orientation."" Andrew is not especially loved by the secular LGBT community, but his book flipped me to an inclusive stance.  Matt Vines ""God and the Gay Christian.""

I have a hard time in believing that being gay is worthy of eternal punishment from God. But at the same time, I feel like having such a liberal view on that makes me not a ""real"" Christian and my morals are then just seen as relative to what the current culture is. How have any of dealt with this?    A person is and should be defined by his spiritual self. Its your spirit that lives eternally, not your body. And the way some Christians look at homosexuality causes them to look at things the wrong way. It helps to look at sexual orientation this way:  Everyone is made spiritually unique. Some are more intelligent, more sensitive, or more imaginative. And God has simply chosen to give some the gift to procreate. Everyone is allowed to love and have their respective partners. None of them are more special than the other. It is just how God made everyone for a purpose we may or may not understand.   What we should be looking out for is confusing love with lust. Love is the desire for someone base on their spiritual self while lust is the desire for someone base on their physical self. Whoever your partner is, you should be with them because of love and not lust.  Once you understand this, you'll realize that the anti-gay attitude in trivial."

Your second question...YOU SOUND EXACTLY LIKE ME. Exactly. Seriously. So I understand. There's another thread I started yesterday in this subreddit and it addresses the anxiety side of things.   Okay, now to answering your questions.  Don't know a ton about United Church of Christ, tbh. But I know that Methodist and Episcopal tend to be more liberal. Presbyterian USA has decided its affirming. Here's a great resource for finding specific churches in your area that are affirming: http://www.gaychurch.org/ I found a Methodist church I like. I'm from a more conservative area, so people tend to be more conservative, but everyone if friendly, honest, and open about differing beliefs. There's a sense of peace there.  For me, I don't think it's a sin to be gay or act on that, but I too have a difficult time reconciling it. There are a ton of great resources, as listed below. I've read Justin Lee's book. Also heard Matthew Vines' got a good book. It's a struggle, but I'm not sure if it has to be. And I TOTALLY get the not feeling like a ""real"" Christian (because all Christians are Republican, of course). I was raised with virtually ALL conservatives and I associated it with loving Jesus. Turns out, the only thing that makes you a Christian is your acceptance of Christ. Funny how that works. How to deal with it? Find people you can trust. Keep looking out for Christians that are more similarly-minded (we exist!). Faith without community is very difficult. And keep researching. Pray. And, when you think you know what you believe, trust that God is going to love you despite your beliefs, whether they're wrong or not. Blessings."

In your situation, it is clear that whoever is calling for this meeting has a particular stance.  But it is not clear that everyone else in your organization takes that same stance (even with regards to the purpose of the meeting).  Especially with graduate students, I am guessing that there are some who are 100% with you on this.  If there is a value like this that you feel strongly about, the question is: Can you make a difference and stick with your values by staying on the inside?  Or is leaving the only way you can make a difference and stick with your values?  It seems definitely worthwhile attending this meeting to get a feel for where the others stand.  It could even be that the organizer is in the minority.  Give people a chance before you leave, and try to engage with even those you disagree with in a respectful way.

I know that many progressive Christians stay in anti-gay churches and organizations in order to create change from within, but my personal conviction is that I cannot be a part of an organization that discriminates against minority groups, because I don't want to support discrimination with my presence. If I were in your shoes, I would let people know that I can't support codified exclusion, and raise the question, ""Are we as an organization more committed to a theological principle than we are to inclusion and community?""

By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. God Is Love  7 Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is [a]born of God and knows God. 8 The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love. 9 By this the love of God was manifested [b]in us, that God has sent His [c]only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him. 10 In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us. 13 By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit. 14 We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.  15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. 16 We have come to know and have believed the love which God has [d]for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. 17 By this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, so also are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear [e]involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love. 19 We love, because He first loved us. 20 If someone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen. 21 And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also.  https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204&version=NASB"

Rather He focused on teaching us ways to be better by treating others with love and kindness while refraining from negative emotions.   God also communicate with us daily if we listen. By faith and through Jesus' teachings we will know whether something is right or wrong with each passing generation. The movement for gay marriage in US had nothing to do with faith but instead legal affairs by people who wanted the same rights afforded to other people.  Spiritually, this whole ""Is gay right or wrong?"" really distracts people from what God intended. There are some who have been born to be attracted to females and those who have been born to be attracted to males, no matter if they are male or female themselves.   Some have been offered the gift to procreate while others have been offered a unique gift that only themselves and God knows. All of them are allowed to love another partner, because no human is designed to be alone.   So if anyone is asking if they are allowed to truly love another person, then the answer is yes."

OpenChristian,3cgs0a,vomitingspaceranger,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:27:15 2015 UTC,"Back then, marriage was different. Augustus had implemented laws regulating marriage and encouraging a ""traditional"" marriage of male and female.   If you weren't married to the opposite sex then life was hard. So marriage was essentially only about procreation and inheriting wealth. There was also no knowledge of sexual orientation, so I doubt anyone thought the same way as we do now.  Jesus said that when a person enters Heaven, they won't be given nor be married. Doubt that means a couple can't be together, I just think it was evidence that He disliked how marriage was viewed at the time.  I believe God intended marriage to be a spiritual union between two people who are committed to one another, regardless of gender. So Jesus, if He really did had a romance relationship, loved the person regardless of who they were physically. And certainly could not marry the same gender under Roman law, as far as I know.  I thought I read somewhere about Jesus having a bride in Heaven but not sure where. This theory isn't far stretched but I think we should be careful about what we say on Jesus' life out of respect."

OpenChristian,3bv60c,invisiblecows,10,Thu Jul 2 14:03:23 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you how to spend a week in the Sermon on the Mount.  Monday, Tuesday:  Read the Sermon on the Mount as if it is practical advice on how to live.  Straight up smart advice, commandments.  Don't brag when you give an offering, be a light to the world, don't worry.  Read the SotM this way for two days.  Wednesday, Thursday:  On these two days, reread the SotM as if Jesus is messing with the Pharisees. The SotM is the anti-ethic that laughs at all our attempts to moralize our way to heaven. Who is blessed?  The one who is poor in spirit.  Someone thinks they are moral because they threw away a friendship with someone who was causing them to sin.  No way, says Jesus, don't cut off your friendship, cut off your own arm.  Someone thinks they are moral because they never kill or commit adultery.  WRONG, says Jesus, you committed murder the last time you said an insulting word, and you committed adultery the last time you watched a woman bend over.  The law says you carry the soldier's burden one mile, go two miles.    Friday, Saturday:  On these days, the weight of the Law in the Sermon on the Mount is more than you can bear.  You realize that you are worried about not worrying, you see yourself as the hypocrite of Matthew 6.  You want to live these rules, but you can't.  And, just as the sun sets on Saturday night, you read the commandment to be perfect as your heavenly Father is in heaven, and you realize you have no hope, you cannot live out the Sermon on the Mount, for even one week.  Sunday morning:  You rise up on Sunday morning, and you realize, you don't have to live it out.  Jesus lived out the Sermon on the Mount for you.  You are free, free indeed."

Back in 2011, our denomination voted to welcome gay clergy and to perform same sex weddings, we lost a number of clergy and congregations who could not accept that position.  But, of all the conservative clergy who I have known (most of whom left for NALC or the Canadian version of the Missouri Synod), not one would ever do something like that.  Even the grumpiest of the most conservative that I have come across would still treat Gospel as the paramount goal of all preaching, and would show basic respect to parishioners.  Who knows, maybe once they are cut free from the ELCIC some may behave worse, but something about the ethos of our denomination made it very hard to be a total jackass.

So, what about holiness, sanctification, righteousness and all the work of perfecting oneself that a Christian does?

OpenChristian,3bv60c,EyesofaJackal,11,Thu Jul 2 15:21:09 2015 UTC,I suggest doing what I did.  Stay Christian but just unsubscribe from  r/christianity and don't ever go back.  I've been raised Christian and have been one my whole life.  I've also been gay for as long as I have been old enough to be interested in anyone.  Interestingly enough the only time I ever felt doubt over my faith or salvation because of my sexuality was from that sub.  I'm not saying I haven't felt unease in my faith or had my doubts outside of it.  And I've had plenty of people in person disagree with me about Christianity and sexuality but never did I ever feel unloved by God except by that sub.

OpenChristian,3bv60c,veggiebutt,6,Thu Jul 2 15:44:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe you just need to hang out with different Christians. I started out as an atheist, and it was the Christians who defied all of my stereotypes that won me over.   There are tons of Christians who consider sexual morality -- so long as you're not hurting another person, including cheating -- a very low priority compared to sins of hatred, violence, greed, etc. that victimize other people.  Those powerful religious experiences you have are a gift from God. Those feelings you have that God accepts you the way you are, without reservations? I believe He does, and it makes me sad that some Christians make you feel further from God, rather than closer.  Also, I'm 53 years old, and trust me, you sound pretty darned low on the pervert scale."

It means he doesn't discriminate, he doesn't only want to save a certain group of people. I've been gay all my life, and he had never stopped making me feel loved and blessed. His love is so powerful that we can spend lifetimes not understanding his full perfect love. Christians are so judgemental but if they they get hit by the encounter of his real love, its amazing!!"
OpenChristian,3bsviz,ericfolkerth,5,Wed Jul 1 21:41:14 2015 UTC,"It should also be mentioned that when a couple sign papers by a government to marry, they are not yet joined spiritually as that is not what Jesus or God never referred to.  A couple becomes spiritually united in intimacy and so that is why it is said not to fornicate with prostitutes or with someone you do not want to commit your life to.  Signing papers has little to do with the union of couples that Jesus is referring to. Whether or not a couple signed a bunch of papers doesn't suddenly unite them under God. They are only united under earthly courts.   So why stop gay couples from receiving the same rights as everyone else? It is only a matter of the courts and not God. That is why Jesus said no one will be still be in marriage after death, because earthly courts have no jurisdiction in Heaven.  But because one in united spiritually by God in intimacy, it is forbidden to commit sexual immorality such as prostitution and rape. Yet many Christians condemn homosexuality and ignore the amount of divorce in Christian communities and acts of adultery.  So remember that a couple is united spiritually not by signing a paper, but by intimacy. Therefore Christians must refrain from barring gay couples from receiving equal rights in any nation. Because earthly courts have no power over spiritual unification, it has no power in one's life with God.  There are many nations and many laws that lasts only a short time but God and His laws are eternal. And His laws does not discriminate upon any of His creations."

OpenChristian,3blgfc,plbogen,2,Wed Jul 1 14:34:29 2015 UTC,"Do not think I support one side. I support whatever God's will is and what I say has made all sides angry because all sides chooses their verse.  Homosexuality is not a sin but it can become one. Just as heterosexuality is not a sin but it can become one. Once, a person could have as many wives as he wanted but it had faded away. Then a woman was only property in marriage, to be sold and used for legal contracts between families. Then it has been change so that woman are only use for procreation and possibly killed if they were barren.   Then marriage was recently turned into a mutual commitment between one man and one wife. And now because marriage is seen as a mutual commitment and romance, people look at relationships in a very different way. And the world is much more educated so nearly everything is vastly different than the world 2,000 years ago.  So homosexuality became more recognize as marriage became more about commitment between two people. A man would not marry another man in ancient times because marriage was a contract or a possession of woman who are property.  So why do you exclude others of the same rights and happiness you give yourself? Many had gone into earthly court and deny others of earthly rights they made themselves all in the name of God. But esrthly courts cannot unite a couple neither can they separate a couple. But let me tell you, there was not a time in which marriage was Heavenly. It was once said, ""in death, no one is married or given in marriage. Everyone will be unmarried as the Angels are."" because marriage is but a human thing. There have been many forms of marriages but God disprove of marriages that has been done in idolatry or intimacy done without commitment to another.  Homosexuality comes with the new definition that marriage is a union of mutual feelings between two people. Be wary of those who place themselves above others and bestow themselves with gifts and rights which they do not give to others."

Romans 6:23 - for the wages of sin is death, BUT the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ.   John 3:16 - For God so loved the world that he sent his only Son, that WHOEVER believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life.

OpenChristian,3bek88,IReallyTriedISuppose,6,Sun Jun 28 22:17:32 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, this is a great failing of many Christians. I know a guy in my Bible study who uses the end of Romans 1 to justify his hatred of gay people and the last time we got together I responded to him for bringing it up.   My opinion is this, yes in Romans it clearly states that God turned his back on those living sinful and unrepentant lives... But it is a sin to lay with ANYONE who isn't your committed partner, so the fact that it's same sex couplings is a moot point. Nevermind the fact that their dedication to false idols and rejection of Him is what caused God to act, not their lustful actions. And if you keep reading, the very beginning of the next chapter states plain as day, we have no excuse for judging others and by doing so condemn ourselves because we are no different and are doing the very same things. The Bible is pretty unclear on a lot of points, this isn't one of them. Regardless of how we feel about any point, judgment isn't ours to deliver.   I don't know how old you are, or where you live, but would it be possible to explore other churches in your area alone?

OpenChristian,3becft,yermyam00,6,Sun Jun 28 12:53:59 2015 UTC,"After spending a short time there, I went to school only to be attacked by one of my Christian friends. I am not out to most of the people in my life yet (including her) so I felt powerless to say anything. She ranted at me for believing in the ""wrong Gospel"" and continuously berated me for supporting LGBT+ rights while being the daughter of a pastor. She ridiculed me in front of my other friends for having a rainbow colored ichthys yet she would say she wasn't forcing anything on me but was just stating her opinion.   A person who has God in them does not treat others with such contempt. They have done nothing but lash out in anger and judged others. Such things are not the work of God because God works through kindness and love only.   Wicked people will use hate to deceive others into thinking that God does not love others and make them feel miserable about themselves. They'll also deceive others into doing their work for them and that God allows hatred. A wicked person will try anything to lead you away from God and spread misery so that others will turn away from God.   That good, reassuring feeling I experienced with the people running the Equal Christ booth is now shattered and I feel immense guilt and sadness..... I don't know what to do about this. I feel terrible and sick now....   Which is what hate and contempt does. It does nothing but lead people away from God and leave people in a bad state. God reaches out to you by acts of love and kindness, not by acts of hatred. Do not let the wicked deceive you into entering a state of despair because God does not dwell in sadness and anger so you will not find God by embracing negative emotions.  Each person is unique to the last cell. A flower will be made red in a field of white flowers. Neither the red flower nor the white flowers can judge the other because they were both created by God and so God loves them all. A white flower cannot hope to be a red flower nor can a red flower hope to be a red flower. The white flowers will jeer at the red flower because there was once only white flowers in the field but the red flower will say that it is created red and therefore accept that it has been created red by God as intended.  Then God looked at the field and saw that some of the white flowers has accepted the red flower and He was pleased. Then He saw the white flowers who called the red flower an abonimation and an affront to God.   So He said, ""Have I not created the Heaven and the Earth and all living creatures? So why do you mock the red flower and say that it cannot be red? Are you not aware that I have designed every pedal and every stem and every leaf? Yet you chose to look at my creation with hate as the brothers of Joseph have done before him.""  But they didn't hear God because their heart was hardened and they have devoted themselves to hate. So God left them to their wickedness and blessed the flowers who embraced His newest creation.  You'll one of God's creations, there's nothing wrong with you and as long as you have faith in God and embrace Jesus' teachings then you're righteous in His eyes. Do not falter because others look at you with hate. God loves you and has created you as intended. Embrace how He has created you and let no one tell you otherwise. Instead, pray for those who are lost and remember that God works through kindness and love.   You have witnessed what wickedness does to people and the misery it leaves. So remember and treat others with love and kindness so that God's love may reach others as it has done to you. A simple act of kindness will shake the mountain of lies by the wicked."

OpenChristian,3bczsd,AStormofSwines,6,Sun Jun 28 07:25:46 2015 UTC,"God works through the love and kindness of others, not the hatred and anger of others.  Do not let your faith and yourself be shaken by those who spread hate. Because that is the entire purpose of hatred, anger, and any negative emotion. Wicked people will try to deceive others into believing that God does not love everyone and that it is okay to embrace hate.   Sin is only what brings someone away from God and comes from the heart in the form of negative emotions that hurt other people physically or mentally. Murder, lust, violence, lying, etc are all done out of contempt for other people and are therefore sins. But anything done out of love and kindness is not a sin.   Anything else is between you and God. Whether or not you believe you should eat certain food, celebrate special holidays, marry the opposite gender, use technology, etc should be kept between you and God. Because you should always do things out of faith that God allows it. Anything that us done unfaithfully or without love and kindness is a sin.  There are buffalos who are born with brown fur, and there are buffalos who are born with white fur. Neither of them are an abomination and neither of them have a right to judge the other. Everyone is unique but all are equal before God.   Whatever you do this day forward, do it out of faith that it is right before God. If you have doubts that it is right before God then refrain from doing it. But do not let others tell you God's love is limited and that you do not deserve the same acceptance as them.   And remember, let your actions be done out of love kindness. If you are about to say or do something out of anger or hate for another then deep breathes and recite this prayer:  “‘Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, 10 your kingdom come, your will be done,     on earth as it is in heaven. 11 Give us today our daily bread. 12 And forgive us our debts,     as we also have forgiven our debtors. 13 And lead us not into temptation,[a]     but deliver us from the evil one.[b]’  You witnessed what acts of kindness has done. God has seen what you experienced and presented His love through others to show that you're not alone and that you're right in His eyes. So treat others with kindness so that they may experience God's love through you."
