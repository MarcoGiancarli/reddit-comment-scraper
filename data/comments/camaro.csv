The auto vs stick thing goes all the way back to the 70's smog era cars.  Performance was nonexistent in the 70's, Corvette and Camaro were slow and nobody wanted a stick.  It was just sales, and GM gave the buyers what they wanted.  Then it got to be that only the hardcore performance guys and the econoboxes had sticks, and that trend continues to this day.    Also, have you ever had to drive a stick in stop and go traffic on the Katy, and on 59 in Houston every day?  Suckssuckssucks.  That LS1 would pull that damn thing along at 10mph in 2nd at idle, which was cool (1998 Z28 6 speed).  Miss that car but I don't miss Houston traffic."

camaro,3duyq1,LanceeMann,4,Tue Jul 21 05:27:31 2015 UTC,"Back in the 80s and 90s, an automatic transmission was seen as a luxury option. So in the general public's eye, it made the Camaro more upscale.  Also, the 5.7L equipped models only came with automatics. The 5 speeds that the 5.0L cars came with couldn't stand up to the torque of the 5.7L Tune Port Injection engine."
camaro,3duyq1,KevinLee487,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:54:58 2015 UTC,Then why did the 80's corvettes with the 5.7L have a Doug Nash 4+3 speed in them? Then a ZF 6 speed manual in 1989?  Edit: I wrote this and I sound like I'm attacking you... Sorry. I'm just arguing the point.
camaro,3duyq1,feenux21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:13:05 2015 UTC,Because those expensive transmissions were justified by the Corvettes MSRP. If the had put a ZF trans in the F-Bodies they would have had to charge more and they already weren't selling all that well.
camaro,3duyq1,KevinLee487,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:41:37 2015 UTC,"So it wasn't that they couldn't make one to handle it, it was just too expensive?"
camaro,3duyq1,feenux21,0,Mon Jul 20 21:13:36 2015 UTC,Exactly. It was either toss in the ZF or beef up the T5. They didn't want to do either so they just tossed on the 700R4 and called it a day.
camaro,3duyq1,KevinLee487,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:17:11 2015 UTC,From what I have been told the 3rd gen  with the 350 in it had too much torque for the tranny (The T5 5speed) they were using in the 3rd gens. So the only way to get a manual transmission in a 3rd gen was the 305.

camaro,3duyq1,WashRotom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:18:28 2015 UTC,"Because the 350 was a common engine for the car and it was never paired with a manual. However, the 305's have manuals* and they aren't too hard to come across.  Edit: I'm right, aren't I? The 350 was common and it was only available with an auto. The 305 is the V8 with the manual transmissions, I believe 4 speed in 1982 models and 5 speed later on."

This was still down compared to the V10 Honda used by the dominant McLarens which were rated at 675 bhp (503 kW; 684 PS). The transmission to which it was mated, however, attracted more attention, as it contained the very first semi-automatic gearbox seen in Formula One. In the first half of the season, it proved to be very unreliable, and hampered Ferrari's efforts. However, such gearboxes would become the norm by the mid-1990s.

camaro,3dwe4a,WashRotom,3,Mon Jul 20 08:34:35 2015 UTC,Looks really clean! You should get a group shot of all the camaros in the family. That would be amazing.
camaro,3dwe4a,Vibratingmountanlion,0,Mon Jul 20 21:20:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I will make another post with them soon!"
camaro,3dwe4a,DaBozz88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:28:35 2015 UTC,When I was 17 I was a cocky shit driving. I had a minivan on two wheels (while that was awesome). Just be careful. I had to crash enough cars (2) to downgrade to a 200hp car. And even that scared people I drove with.   I have two pieces of advice for you:  1) take the camaro to a track event to give you somewhere to drive it fast.   B) get a job you need to drive for. I was driving for a service company (very shady) but I would drive for hours on end.   Paging /u/drzack3 for his fear for his life.   Sorry other DrZack
camaro,3dwe4a,DrZack,3,Mon Jul 20 02:46:27 2015 UTC,Im so confused I don't understand what this is  EDIT: NP NP! Enjoy you car stuff :)

camaro,3dtf0a,pogiepelton,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:32:22 2015 UTC,"You will definitely need new mounts. I have a 78 Camaro and considered doing this but it was a little too much work for me. A few other things to keep in mind that I ran into doing research are the drive shaft length, front suspension if the swap causes a considerable weight change (springs and control arms), especially the rear end (it won't matter how much better that motor is if you can't get the power to the ground). Someone a little more experienced than me can probably speak a little better to this but I honestly don't think measurements would really help you. I would guess there's too much going on for measurements of the old motor to help with the new one. I would think that you would have to dry fit the new motor first to check mount placements and clearance (especially for the firewall and teams tunnel), make the weld for the new mounts, and then put the motor in."
camaro,3dtf0a,Meandmybuddyduncan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:46:08 2015 UTC,"Trans tunnel needs cut, add hole for shifter, new cross member. Also need to add clutch pedal. The drives shaft will need to be custom made for length and corect yoke. Exhaust probably needs moved but usually you can bend it far enough. The engine should bolt in but the fuel system needs complete changed as no fuel injection came in the second Gen."
camaro,3dtf0a,greenmaro,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:08:49 2015 UTC,"I picked up a spectra fuel injection tank for the car, its got the 3 lines and pump inside. I measured the distance between the motor mounts and the trans mount today and it was only out by an inch and a bit, I'm going to try modifying the existing 81 cross brace with some 1/4"" plate to reach the mounts on the t56. I've got the clutch pedal assembly out of an 81 4 speed car thats gonna be replacing whats in there now."
camaro,3dtf0a,greenmaro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:53:25 2015 UTC,The main problem is the t56 is very tall compared to a th350. Also I think you can just move the cross member and re drill holes. The engine blocks are the same so no problem there. Also do you have a z bar for the t56 I thought they were all hydraulic.
camaro,3drpye,Debatinggoose,2,Sat Jul 18 20:34:54 2015 UTC,Should be on the lower drivers side of the rad
camaro,3drpye,gerbsters,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:01:51 2015 UTC,lower left side on the radiator
camaro,3dn4d3,nothing_isay_isvalid,5,Fri Jul 17 16:52:19 2015 UTC,Isn't it made in Canada?
camaro,3dn4d3,musical_throat_punch,5,Fri Jul 17 21:57:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think the engine is too"
camaro,3dn4d3,notarapist72,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:36:43 2015 UTC,The CAI looks sweet btw.
camaro,3dn4d3,musical_throat_punch,2,Fri Jul 17 23:14:36 2015 UTC,Thanks sounds great too
camaro,3dn4d3,musical_throat_punch,3,Sat Jul 18 01:01:07 2015 UTC,Intake is made in Mexico lol but hey chevy runs deep
camaro,3dn4d3,CaptSkunk,2,Sat Jul 18 01:00:37 2015 UTC,Really? My CAI was made in the USA.
camaro,3dn4d3,UncleFlip,2,Sat Jul 18 01:02:15 2015 UTC,Intake manifold sorry. Yea the cai is made in the us
camaro,3dn4d3,frogstomp427,2,Sat Jul 18 01:06:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe but Canada is America Jr. They can make our cars if they want to. I love Canada, even though I'm American."
camaro,3dmmys,t0e_jam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:36:59 2015 UTC,Almost my absolute dream car. Just needs the 396 instead of the 350. Beautiful girl nonetheless!
camaro,3dmmys,dmartin16,2,Fri Jul 17 14:45:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Just picked it up last week.  It is on a truck and will hopefully be in my garage next weekend.  I've always been partial to the sound of the small block over the big block, but would gladly have either.  :)"
camaro,3dqru5,hvac101,4,Sat Jul 18 15:33:28 2015 UTC,"The warranty covers cracking and crumbling, I don't think I've ever heard of a warranty that covers wear and how could they since the pad wearing is part of the braking process?"
camaro,3dqru5,zipperific,-2,Sat Jul 18 15:57:32 2015 UTC,I can absolutely see that part but in about 50 brake jobs I have personally done they have never said anything. This always seemed to be a loss leader to me. Like on my ticket I spent $180.00 and only $60 was pads.  I just figured I would pass the info along in case someone else was in the dark on it like me. I talked to a couple friends and asked them and they were like me and asked why. They had the same experience of swaps with no questions.
camaro,3dqru5,zipperific,3,Sat Jul 18 16:32:05 2015 UTC,So what exactly is the take away from all this?
camaro,3dqru5,zipperific,-1,Sat Jul 18 16:39:02 2015 UTC,Lol I guess the take away is ask what lifetime means. I don't think I'm the only person that this has happened to. If I can inform one person then hey it's worth it. I know if I had seen this before it would change my options.
camaro,3dqru5,CocksuckOfDouchebag,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:57:20 2015 UTC,"The guy behind the counter rarely knows what he's talking about. I was buying calipers and he boasted a warranty in the part.. ""Sure. How about these threads here, are these covered?"" ""Absolutely!"" He said.. Hanging out of the threads is a small piece of paper that specifically states the threads are excluded from the warranty. Of course they are, I was just testing the waters.  Don't trust anything you hear until you know it's fact. Until you have fully read and understand the terms and conditions of every agreement or warranty, you can't count on anything"
