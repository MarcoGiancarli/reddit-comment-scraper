This is also a quick read. Putting up the bat houses should definitely help them move out and there's no need to wait to set those up.

batty,39msbn,Kamikazesaint,5,Fri Jun 12 21:11:30 2015 UTC,"If you found the bat flying around or hanging on the wall in your home, it's most likely doing fine. Try to release it at night / when it gets darl (make sure no cat is around to catch it..). If it won't fly, it's most likely weakened and it needs to be taken care of. Give it to that person that's supposed to come to you.  If you're going to keep the bat for a while (to give it to that person or to wait for dusk) do the following: punch few holes for air in the box. fill the box halfway with lightly balled paper   tissue. take the lid of a plastic bottle (or something similar) and fill it with water and put it in the box. close the box with tape (bats are pros at escaping).  please wear gloves or use a towel when you handle the bat. put the box somewhere quiet to reduce stress for the animal :)"
batty,39msbn,picala,2,Fri Jun 12 22:24:41 2015 UTC,"I've previously caught it and already released it, but it managed to get back into the house. I planned to just hand it over over the bat handler that is coming so he can relocate it.  Thanks for telling me to give it water though, I was unsure if they needed water, or if they just got their liquids through what they ate."
batty,39msbn,remotectrl,3,Fri Jun 12 22:36:55 2015 UTC,"Some bats, particularly desert adapted bats, can get all their water from their food but its nice to present them with the option.  If he flew away on his own the first time and came back, there's a chance he (or she) was living in your attic or crawl spaces. There are definitely worse creatures to have in your home since bats don't cause structural damage and even the risk of histoplasmosis and rabies is low, but you don't want them getting in your living spaces. You should consider putting up a bat house if you do find more bats as it will give them an alternative and that can make exclusions more effective since they will move into the new home rather than try to find their way back in the old one.  May I ask where the person is coming from? Unless they are wildlife rehabitator or something similar, they probably don't need to have the animal and you can just release it again tonight. The treatment for bats from a structural pest management perspective is the same regardless of species. Having a picture is enough evidence that they will believe you when you say you had bats. If it comes back, take a picture of where you find it as that may be a clue to where it's entering."
batty,39msbn,remotectrl,3,Fri Jun 12 22:54:32 2015 UTC,"It's a company called tru tech inc, I didn't want to just release it myself because it would just get back into my roof. I also didn't want to drive somewhere and release it for fear that it would be a bad place to let a bat go haha, I don't want the fella to die, I just want him out of my roof."
batty,39msbn,picala,3,Fri Jun 12 23:11:10 2015 UTC,"First place I point people is to this resource. There is more information here on what to expect with having bats entering buildings and what options you have.  Everything that /u/picala said is pretty good, except maybe with the exception of handing it over to the person coming to look for more bats. If that person is an exterminator, they may kill the creature which may be regrettable. If you do have more bats in your house, you will want to do a humane exclusion. If they recommend any treatment besides an exclusion, try a different company. Since it is summer, you should wait to do this until fall if there is more than one bat because if its a colony they may have pups and doing an exclusion could kill them by separating them from their parents. Dead animals in your attic are something you'd want to avoid.  If you are concerned about it having enough food, many insectivorous bats will eat mealworms which you can get at pet stores (they are common pet food for pet lizards). It may also eat crickets (you can also purchase those at the pet store), but I'm not sure if it will do those things on their own or if it requires some training that you may not be able to do in the time that you have it.  I'll echo the need for gloves. I think gardening gloves with a rubberized finger and palm like this are the best as the bats can't bite through them and it gives more dexterity than leather gloves. I've been bitten through surgical gloves and that hurt but it didn't break through the glove, though it did startle me enough to drop the bat. He was okay though.  Another option you might have that might work as a temporary fix  to prevent this or other bats from entering your home until you do an exclusion is to set up some lights around whatever entrances they are coming to. Most bats don't like light generally (light pollution and bats in an ongoing subject) and will probably be less likely to come close. Make sure the lights are LEDs because other kinds are more likely to attract insects.   He looks a bit like an evening bat but it's hard to be certain without measurements of their ears, body, and forearms (this particularly)."
batty,39msbn,remotectrl,2,Fri Jun 12 22:42:58 2015 UTC,"Bats are protected in the state that I live in, so he's not an exterminator. This house had a nest in the attic before I moved in, and the land lord had it relocated, it seems at least this bat managed to sneak in. The house is still under warranty from the company actually.  I've also ordered a ""bat repellent,"" It's supposed to keep the bats from entering the house through some type of sound wave. I'll look at getting some meal worms tomorrow for the guy. I do understand that there may be pups, I'll ask the handler that's coming out when we should relocate them, I don't mind waiting until fall."
batty,39msbn,remotectrl,3,Fri Jun 12 22:56:13 2015 UTC,"only bigger species eat mealworms like that.. we usually have to cut at least the head off. the smaller species' jaws aren't strong enough to chew the worms, you'd have to chop their head off and squeeze the insides out.."

But here's what they said when the image was shared on facebook (where I first saw it):   Here you can see a Myotis myotis with damaged wings. The first photo was taken when she came to our station, the second after many months of medical treatment. Of course we will continue the therapy until she is able to fly again. Chances of total recovery and releasing are high!   Therapy - The bat needs every evening training like climbing, walking and spreading the wing. So it's important to have a person caring for the bat as long as possible in the night so that the blood circulation in the wing is good. You need to have a good feeling for the animal so it must be a therapy by training but it musn't be stress for the bat. It is very important that the bat always feels comfortable. During the Winter this patient will spend the time in a room with normal warm temperature about 20 degrees celcius. Hibernation is not allowed because injuries cannot heal during hibernation. By the way hibernation in a warm place would kill the bat because of dehydration. In this case we also use a special bio-laser-therapy, but for this you must be well educated and you have to be save in the handling.  Please, spread the word for the bats so that many bats can get help. Please, support our work, too, so that we can help many more bats   http://batsconservationfledermaus.blogspot.de/p/donations-spenden.html"

batty,3606l9,remotectrl,1 point,Thu May 14 23:56:56 2015 UTC,How do bats get in a people house?  If they can get in through the vents many bats will roost in the attic. Once in the attic they will sometimes find their way through a small hole into the house. Then they are trapped and get desperate and afraid.   If it's dark open the doors and turn off the lights and they may find their way out. Even as mosquitoes find their way in. You can also catch them with a butterfly net or a fine mesh landing/fishing net. But carefully. They are delicate creatures.  Except for the guano I'd love to have bats in my attic.
batty,3606l9,alllie,2,Fri May 15 14:51:20 2015 UTC,I've heard of people placing tarps under attic bat roosts to catch the droppings and they take it out periodically. That should probably not be done without a respirator or other air filter.  Exclusions from attics and homes seem to work best when an alternate roost is provided.

It ranges from Senegal in the west, through West Africa, to Cameroon and Central Africa including much of the Congo basin, into Uganda and East Africa including Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. It has been recorded as far south as southern Democratic Republic of the Congo and northern Angola. It occurs at elevations of up to 3,200 m asl. These bats are rather common; they are most often found in small groups of fewer than 20 animals.  This species has been recorded from a variety of habitats, ranging from lowland and montane tropical moist forest, to moist savanna, tropical dry forest and mangroves. Recorded roosting sites include roofs, eaves of houses and small crevices in houses, with natural sites presumably including hollow trees or under bark."

They don't have any other competitors, to my knowledge, being the only bat species. We did introduce owls to the islands as a misguided attempt at biocontrol. That probably is not great for the bats."
batty,33mpdj,remotectrl,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:04:23 2015 UTC,"One hundred five cattle egrets, Bubulcus ibis (Linnaeus), and 21 barn owls, Tyto alba (Scopoli), were liberated for horn fly and rodent control duting 1959- The cattle egrets were released on Oahu, Kauai, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii, while the barn owls were released on Hawaii, Oahu, and Kauai.   The cattle egrets are one of the most common birds I see around Maui, other contenders are Mynah, sparrows,   Japanese white-eyes, and cardinals. I've heard some sounds in the evening that seem to be the introduced owls. I don't think I've seen a native bird on the island yet.   Kauai and the big island have far more native forests which probably help the Ōpeʻapeʻa. I hope that some of the reforestation efforts starting to happen here help these guys out."
batty,33mpdj,HonorInDefeat,2,Fri Apr 24 02:16:29 2015 UTC,"Hoary bats on the mainland seem to really like edge habitats, as I recall. So where a forest meets a field of whatever, they love that. A lot of bats seem to specialize in a certain prey or habitat, thought to be due to limited resources and competition. I wonder if the Ope'ape'a is more of a generalist because it hasn't had to compete with other bat species for food.   If you are interested in hearing them, you could build or purchase a simple bat detector. I've had luck with finding them on eBay.   Edit: found one on eBay for fairly cheap. Make that two"

The species name fistulata is derived from the Latin word fistula, meaning ""tube"". It refers to the bat's lower lip, which extends 3.3–4.8 mm beyond the upper lip and is rolled into a funnel shape. The exact function of the tube-lip is unknown. The bat has the longest tongue (8.5 cm) relative to its body size of any mammal. Its tongue is 150% the size of its overall body length.  By convergent evolution, pangolins, the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), and the tube-lipped nectar bat all have a tongue that is detached from their hyoid bones and extend past the pharynx deep into the thorax.  This extension lies between the sternum and the trachea.  Despite its exceptionally long tongue, the tube-lipped nectar bat has a varied diet that includes nectar, pollen, and insects. This arrangement is possible due to its short jaw. The base of the tongue is in the bat's rib cage.  One plant, Centropogon nigricans, with its 8– to 9-cm-long corollae, is pollinated exclusively by this bat.
