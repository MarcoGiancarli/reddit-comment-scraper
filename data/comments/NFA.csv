NFA,3e3poo,jayemo,2,Tue Jul 21 19:52:46 2015 UTC,Baking Soda blasting is often use to remove excess plaque from teeth. Pretty gentle compared to other methods. Also the preferred method for cleaning oxidized ZN and AL carbs.

NFA,3e3poo,jayemo,2,Wed Jul 22 14:52:04 2015 UTC,As for paint will come off??? Shooting would remove paint long before you need to clean.  Tumbling usually uses a media softer than the base metal but hard enough to remove debris. Corn husk would work but quickly gets caked with carbon. Walnut hull media might work better.  Of course both would take more time.  If all baffles have the same profile it wouldn't take much work to create a cutter to remove most of it before a final tumbling.

I'll give you the Cliff's Notes version: under 21, you can manufacture NFA items on Form 1, and receive a transfer of an NFA item on Form 4 from an unlicensed transferor. You cannot receive a transfer of an NFA item from an FFL holder, because you are required to complete Form 4473, which only permits them to transfer Title I long guns to individuals under 21.  A trust is a legal document, so you are clear to sign under your own name at the age of 18. You can use one of the off-the-shelf kinds you find on the internet or go to a lawyer."
NFA,3dz9ll,jcalvinmarks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:18:08 2015 UTC,"Everytime I looked up ""can you start a trust under 21"" or something of the like, it only comes up with results from truth about guns and such with only starting a trust and nothing about age.

Pretty much. Although if you list your father or some other person over the age of 21 as a co-trustee, then they can go and effect the transfer from the dealer. The Form 4 from the NFA branch just lists the trust's name, so from the examiner's perspective they don't even know about you, let alone how old you are. But when you go to get your toy out of jail, the individual who is actually taking possession of it from the dealer at that time still has to complete a Form 4473 (since a suppressor is a ""firearm"" for this purpose), and if that person is under 21 then the dealer won't turn it over.  Why is your dad hemming and hawing about the trust? Does he not want to be bothered with the hassle of it all, or does he not want you to have a suppressor?"

NFA,3dz9ll,jcalvinmarks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:04:08 2015 UTC,"Then buy the trust, list yourself as the primary trustee and list your father as a co-trustee. If there's anyone else you want as a co-trustee list them as well. You'll execute the trust itself under your name and signature (it will probably need to be notarized). Each co-trustee will complete their declaration of co-trustee, which will also be notarized. His involvement will be limited to riding to the bank to  write his name and have a notary stamp it. Then he'll go pick up the silencer once it's out of NFA Jail, and complete Form 4473 under his name.  Otherwise you can a) wait a little less than 2 years, b) find a private individual who wants to sell a used silencer, or c) manufacture your own on a Form 1."

I wouldn't get the short version of any suppressor. The whole point is to make something hearing safe. For the trouble and expense one must got through to get one, it had better do it's job as well as possible. If I ever have to use one without earpro, the lower dB the less hearing damage.

NFA,3ddlif,factionfx,2,Wed Jul 15 19:45:35 2015 UTC,"However, I don't think the end cap is interchangeable on the Osprey.

Additionally, I don't think that the suppressor is lower enough height wise than the octane to matter.  I have to line up sights through the suppressor on both cans on an XDm.

That's not the same as ""twice as loud"" but close enough as to make little difference.  I bought a .45 osprey for exactly the multi caliber use you describe, then later bought a 9mm osprey to round out the collection.

Also they have a different thread pattern and pitch. So with that as well as the stupid laws and penalties for breaking those are pretty stiff. I would error on the side of caution.  From what I have read and IANAL you can down size but not up size.  I would just do another for a .30 cal and enjoy having another one.

Full auto rated (mag dumps will not happen often, but will happen).  Quite enough for HD, at least to the point where I am not concussed.  Suppresses enough flash to not be spitting fireballs after the first round (I've heard some TI throw serious sparks).  Light enough not to seriously unbalance a relatively light build.

One way you can do it is to form 4 a new lower from Rainier arms or whoever else does it. We are waiting on the opinion of the AG to decide if we can form 1 as far as I know. Or like you mentioned you can file a form 1 with a 5320.20 to Oregon or Idaho and assemble it there. Although, I don't know if the ATF will approve it."

I already own 2 AR lowers that are currently attached to a 223 and 300BLK upper.  I don't think I want to have these non-SBR lowers laying around with an upper.  So I guess the current way around this legal snafu - is to construct this in Oregon at a friend's house.  First by applying for form 1 with the address in OR, then 5320.20 to the home of the trust in WA after?"
NFA,3cyz5b,trashythrow,2,Sun Jul 12 02:55:28 2015 UTC,I don't think you can apply the form 1 in a different state but I don't know. I've heard of people putting the form 1 and the 5320.20 at the same time but some dude who works for the WA dol told the ATF to stop approving form 1s.  I'm pretty sure having an upper is not constructive intent but if you're concerned about it you could buy a stripped lower and assemble as a pistol until you get a different lower SBRed plus it would be covered if you have a CPL or no paperwork to take it out of state.
NFA,3cyz5b,cawpin,2,Sun Jul 12 03:17:38 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as constructive intent. It's constructive possession. If you don't have a legal way to assemble a short upper, having a pistol lower or SBR lower, then you could be in violation of the rule."

NFA,3cyz5b,elwrigley,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:20:02 2015 UTC,"To negate the last item on your list, OP could buy the CAA/Thordsen combo and slap that on one of the lowers instead of a stock.

After a thorough cleaning I decided to take some photos while re-assembling it. It's likely the finest semi-automatic 300BLK suppression setup (as far as I'm concerned anyway.   Using subsonic 300BLK it sounds almost like a pneumatic tool. It's quite strange really, if one were blind folded I'm not sure it would be easily identified as a gun shot. Almost like the cross between a staple gun, an air tool, and that suppressed shotgun from No Country For Old Men.  It's to the point where the sproing of the buffer spring is infuriating and forces you to buy one of those JP silent captured spring buffers. It meters only a few dB above the noise of dropping the bolt on an empty chamber.  It's amazing how little it weighs and it balances nicer than any of my muzzle cans because of the way the weight is distributed back behind the barrel muzzle. Titanium tube & stainless monocore.

The next spacer is 1/2"" then the next 3 are 1/4"". The baffles are Freeze Plugs formed into a 60 degree cone.. The first FP has 8 1/8"" holes in it, the second has 6 1/8"" holes and the third has 4 1/8"" holes. The other 9 are solid. The only thing I'm thinking about changing is either flipping the first FP or leaving it flat. Not sure at this point in time.

NFA,3bxwwm,McFeely_Smackup,6,Fri Jul 3 01:56:19 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with the design, but if you're going to all the trouble of building it, 5.56 is not going to be a very satisfying caliber for suppression results.  It's still going to be ""loud as shit""."
NFA,3bxwwm,Bijiont,3,Fri Jul 3 04:32:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, they would be better off drilling it for 30 caliber so they can use it on different rifles.

NFA,3bxwwm,Pivotal_Goose,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:33:20 2015 UTC,The problem is that the tube and baffles/spacers are from a different supplier that doesn't use a brake as the mounting device. It uses a direct screw on adapter. I had to modify the design to accommodate the brake. Are your baffles flat or coned?

NFA,3bxwwm,ed1380,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:36:19 2015 UTC,If your worried about baffle strikes 11/32 is pretty tight. I read on the SD tactical forums that there isn't much of a difference in sound suppression from baffles drilled out at 11/32 to 3/8. 3/8 size baffles just give you a little wiggle room just incase your holes are perfectly drilled in the center.

NFA,3bocyr,oshaghennessey,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:19:19 2015 UTC,By the ATFs own definition a silencer must lower the sound signature. Sig's muzzle brake actually loudens the gun without the supressor sleeve on it. ATF done fucked up and is going to get slapped down if a judge rules on the letter of the law instead of making up things to fit a narrative.
NFA,3bocyr,jkeyser14,0,Wed Jul 8 01:28:23 2015 UTC,"without the supressor sleeve on it So you agree it is the baffle stack of a suppressor?  Suppressor parts fall under the definition of a silencer, and you need a stamp for it.  This ""muzzle brake"" is literally the baffle stack of a suppressor because they marketed a suppressor kit that only included the tube and end cap."
NFA,3bocyr,oshaghennessey,0,Wed Jul 8 16:02:21 2015 UTC,"It is a baffle stack only when you add the tube, otherwise it functions as a muzzle break which increases the sound level instead of decreasing it. So no, it isn't a silencer baffle until it is used as such."
NFA,3bocyr,jkeyser14,0,Wed Jul 8 17:37:10 2015 UTC,"The ATF does not agree.  It falls under the category of suppressor parts, which are treated as suppressors themselves."
NFA,3bo9jp,happyshlappy,8,Tue Jun 30 20:27:22 2015 UTC,"Here's the deal.  If you purchase it premade it is transferred to you via form 4 from the seller.  You pay for it up front, send the paperwork and a check to the ATF and a few months later the seller gets the approved form 4 in the mail and you get to take home your suppressor.  If you plan on building it on a form 1 (application to manufacture and register a firearm, or something like that) you can possess parts that will ultimately become suppressor parts but you may not possess suppressor parts.  The ATF views a part of a suppressor to be an entire suppressor (its bullshit I know).  What I mean is if you plan on submitting a form 1 on a maglite/freeze plug suppressor you can have the tube and the freeze plugs, you can even put them together as a solvent trap but if you put a hole in just one freeze plug you should put your dog in protective custody.  All of that being said keep in mind I'm a stranger on the internet who never went to law school, has no idea what your local laws are and may just be making all of this up.

NFA,3bo9jp,XA36,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:16:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly I read forums and Reddit, find something that catches my eye and then find a reliable source for it.  It's often easier to work backwards with this stuff.    Example:  If I wanted to learn more about the manufacture of suppressors by a non licensee I would probably start by looking for a ATF letter that has setting to do with it.  From that letter I may find a reference to a regulation, law or something that I can look up on a government website, I would then look it up and see where that takes me.  It's important to understand these kinds of things are typically written in legalese and while you may think you understand them the reality is you will likely miss something.  It's important to have an attorney interpret the law for you when if you make a mistake prison is a possibility.  I work in a law firm as a paralegal and read/write legalese for a living and I still wouldn't be willing to say ""yes, I'm positive that's what the law is"" when it comes to this kind of stuff."
NFA,3bo9jp,wckdwabbit,2,Wed Jul 1 17:38:46 2015 UTC,"It works differently. You go to store (online or shop), you find the silencer you want, buy it (so $600 - $800 aprox) and then you start the paperwork which includes the $200 tax stamp portion of thing on top of that. After It's all done and approved in about a year then you finally get to take home that silencer."
NFA,3bo9jp,greekplaya990,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:38:55 2015 UTC,"If you are buying, all the paperwork and stamp have to be approved before you take position of the suppressor.

As for the freeze plugs, I got them from [Napa](Expansion Plug, 1.350""; 34.300 mm). I did not form them in any way, I just drilled the holes.   As for the freeze plugs and the centering tool, I see there are quite a few people selling center tapped and formed freeze plugs for semi decent prices.  That was not the case when I built my first one.  I would probably buy them that way today.   The number of freeze plugs in my plan was 8, with 3 one inch spacers and 1 spacer cut to length. I stacked 4 freeze plugs near the business end of the suppressor then alternated 3 one inch spacers and the remaining freeze plugs to the end cap.

NFA,3bdhxe,lunacite,2,Sun Jun 28 06:40:49 2015 UTC,"So called ""racing the forms"". Poor form at best, perjury and illegal at worst. Originally people sent them off at the same time and some still stagger but if the ATF finds it can cause trouble for the ffl and cause your form to be rejected. Likelihood  is that no one would find out, but i wouldnt want to try."
NFA,3bchog,helix6,3,Sat Jun 27 22:28:18 2015 UTC,I have read something similar. Solution I have found was to do it before the stamp comes back. Then they aren't handling an NFA item.
NFA,3bchog,Roeschu,14,Sat Jun 27 23:39:03 2015 UTC,They aren't handling an NFA weapon even after the stamp comes back.  The stamp is approval to make an SBR.  It's not an SBR until you've made it one.  It's just a regular ol lower receiver.
NFA,3bchog,peanutbuttergoodness,5,Sun Jun 28 04:39:55 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer.   Think of it like a stripped lower receiver is an ""other firearm"" until it is made into a pistol or rifle. (In this case SBR)"
NFA,3bchog,linux203,2,Sun Jun 28 05:36:57 2015 UTC,"i agree, get it done before... lets say you get it done after and instead of ABC trust he engraves ABD trust... you get the pleasure of more paperwork. if its just a 'firearm' and he fucks it up you get the pleasure of another firearm."
NFA,3bchog,droolinfool,2,Sat Jun 27 23:59:21 2015 UTC,"OK, I guess the real question is can a non-FFL shop work on my lower while I'm present with no licensing (legally). I also think it is a good idea to do the engraving pre-emptively in case there is a major snafu."
NFA,3bchog,mihaig,3,Sun Jun 28 00:04:14 2015 UTC,Yes they can.
NFA,3bchog,NotDuddy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:16:56 2015 UTC,Yes as long as you are present and in control of the item. I read on one of the forums that engraving isn't considered modifying. It is considered marking and is exempt from an FFL requirement. I can't find where I read it though. I usually get mine engraved before the stamp comes back. That way if there is a FUBAR I can cancel the stamp and get my money back. So far I've not had to do that. Just because it's engraved does not mean it is an NFA item. I have several firearms in my trust that are not NFA items. The engraving shows who the owner or maker is.
NFA,3bchog,_ak_,-1,Sun Jun 28 00:57:19 2015 UTC,"I can't find where I read it though.     I think what you're looking for is in 27 CFR 478.124(a).  Keep in mind that engraving is repair work. No 4473 is required, but it must be engraved by a licensed person (i.e. FFL).    § 478.124 Firearms transaction record. (a) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer shall not sell or otherwise dispose, temporarily or permanently, of any firearm to any person, other than another licensee, unless the licensee records the transaction on a firearms transaction record, Form 4473: Provided, That a firearms transaction record, Form 4473, shall not be required to record the disposition made of a firearm delivered to a licensee for the sole purpose of repair or customizing when such firearm or a replacement firearm is returned to the person from whom received."

NFA,3b4tn6,bammad33,-1,Fri Jun 26 16:51:02 2015 UTC,"Fork up the cash and get a trust - that way you don't have to deal with LEO's. The guys at suppressor shop was very adamant about not going through LEO and to instead get a trust. The trust also allows others to have possession of the NFA item, and you can leave the items to somebody - it can be changed to make amendments to add/remove things whenever you want.  From what I understand with the LEO route is only you can be in possession - ever - and if you die nobody can do anything with it and must call the ATF for article removal where it will probably be destroyed. If they do mess with it they could face federal prosecution if something happens, or something along those lines."
NFA,3b4tn6,_ak_,0,Fri Jun 26 02:40:13 2015 UTC,"Trust definitely has the advantage of allowing multiple people to be named on the trust and take posession of it.  But your statements about individuals are not accurate.   From what I understand with the LEO route is only you can be in possession - ever - and if you die nobody can do anything with it and must call the ATF for article removal where it will probably be destroyed. If they do mess with it they could face federal prosecution if something happens, or something along those lines.   It can be sold or transfered just like any other NFA item.  If the Form 1 owner dies, it can be transfered via a Form 5 tax exempt to a person listed in the owners will."
NFA,3b4tn6,bammad33,-1,Fri Jun 26 06:50:18 2015 UTC,"With a trust:   (1)  ATF applications by gun trusts do not require fingerprints, photographs, or local chief law enforcement officer (CLEO) approval. ATF applications by individuals do require fingerprints, photographs, and CLEO approval.   Set the trust up and its done - no other additional bullshit to worry about. Don't have to deal with the LEO.   (2)  NFA firearms registered to a gun trust can be used and possessed by more than one person. The settlors of the gun trust can add or delete persons who are allowed to use and possess the NFA firearms throughout their lifetimes. NFA firearms registered to an individual can only be used and possessed by the registered individual during the individual’s lifetime.   Without a trust, only you can be in possession. By law - you cannot touch the NFA item even if it is given to you in a will, unless all the paperwork is already taken care of.   As for inheritence:   9.5.3.1 Distributions to heirs. Although these distributions are not treated as “transfers” for purposes of the NFA, Form 5 must be filed by an executor or administrator to register a firearm to a lawful heir and the form must be approved by ATF prior to distribution to the heir. The form should be filed as soon as possible. However, ATF will allow a reasonable time to arrange for the transfer. This generally should be done before probate is closed. When a firearm is being transferred to an individual heir, his or her fingerprints on FBI Forms FD-258 must accompany the transfer application. The application will be denied if the heir’s receipt or possession of the firearm would violate Federal, State, or local law. The law enforcement certification on the form need not be completed. The form should also be accompanied by documentation showing the executor’s or administrator’s authority to distribute the firearm as well as the heir’s entitlement to the firearm. Distributions to heirs should not be made until Forms 5 are approved. Executors and administrators are not required to have estate firearms registered to them prior to distribution to lawful heirs. 9.5.3.2 Distributions to persons outside the estate. Distributions of NFA firearms by executors or administrators to persons outside the estate (not beneficiaries) are “transfers” under the NFA and require an ATF-approved transfer form. Transfers of serviceable firearms to other entities or persons require an approved Form 4. Form 4 applications must be accompanied by the applicable transfer tax, and, if the transferee is an individual, the transferee’s fingerprints on FBI Forms FD-258. Applications will be denied if transferees’ receipt or possession of the firearms would violate Federal, State, or local law. Also, Form 4 applications to transfer firearms to individuals must contain the law enforcement certification of an appropriate law enforcement official. See Section 9.8 for further information on these certifications. Form 4 applications to transfer firearms to non-FFLs residing outside the State in which the estate is being administered will be denied. Form 4 transfers should not be made until the transfers are approved.    You have a heart attack or die in the next 30 minutes with a trust, well the paperwork is already done and they can already be in legal possesion. Having the NFA item in your name and yes it can be transferred, but there are tons of issues involved. For example - if you die tomorrow, you can transfer the item but according to the ATF the owner of the item is dead - so legally you cannot move it and the only authority who is allowed to handle the NFA item is the ATF. Get caught messing with it - felony. Then once the process for probate starts it could take even longer to get your items. ever been stuck in probate? If there is anything of value it can take some time - I think my grandparents probate took 5 years and there are 4 attorney's in my family - thats just how complicated things can get.  And again, where is the NFA item? By law, only the owner of the NFA item is allowed to have possession, which should mean its secured so that nobody else can get it. If anybody else has access to the NFA item, its against the law.  There is a reason the courts give you the right to an attorney - the legal world is very complicated to try and interpret by yourself. I'm positive if you were charged with a felony you would hire an attorney rather than represent yourself - by not getting a trust you are basically representing yourself in the event that you do something wrong.   During my last visit to Suppressor Shop in Austin, the guy at the front was very specific to a customer about the limitations of registering the NFA item in your name, vs getting a trust. I'm pretty sure I am going to take the advice of the guys that do this everyday, are in contact with the ATF, as well as have attorney's that work with them and have their own ATF agent they use regularly for paperwork. I'm sure that some random guy on the internet giving advice to not worry about problems on government documentation knows so much  more than the people who do this for a living.  Did you know its a felony to falsify or lie on government documents?  ATF NFA rules"
NFA,3b4tn6,_ak_,0,Fri Jun 26 13:09:32 2015 UTC,"Local gun shops are often wrong about firearms laws, as they are in this case.  BATFE Form 5 is used for transferring firearms belonging to an individual tax free to the beneficiary of their estate."

It can be transferred, but if the item was in the individuals possession vs a trust, the NFA item cannot be transffered until the will and probate are complete and all assets are taken care of. Until that time, nobody can touch it. The only legal entity that can handle an NFA item in the even of a death of the individual is the ATF - your attorney can't touch it, your LEO can't touch it, the FBI can't touch it - onl y the ATF.  All that also assumes the heir is legally allowed to own the NFA item.   So as I said, the people who do this for a living say the trust is the best way. Are you are Bar certified attorney - cause the guys I get my legal advice from are attorney's who specialize in this area of law."
NFA,3b4tn6,linux203,0,Fri Jun 26 13:46:48 2015 UTC,"If they left the (Name of Maker) line blank, the ATF will probably kick it back.  The next section should be blank because it was delegated.  The delegate fields should be filled in.  Personally, I would not write my own name in the maker field, I would take the form back to the department and ask the person who certified to fill your name in.  I wouldn't want to take the chance of the ATF kicking it back because the handwriting or typeface differs."

NFA,3b436c,Studsmcgee,8,Thu Jun 25 20:20:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that this sounds extremely sketchy. A gun trust on a single page without any NFA specific verbiage? Your suspicion and hesitation is justified IMHO. Does this lawyer know what he's doing? Does he understand you wanted a gun trust for NFA purposes?  As I see it, you have three options here:  1) Go back to the lawyer, explain to him exactly what you want, and refer him to the links in the sidebar for reference. Hopefully he'll get it and create a new proper trust for you.   2) Get a cheap gun trust from one of the various online sources. If you want a trust for the sole purpose of making BATFE applications easier by eliminating the CLEO signoff portion, if you want cheap and easy, and don't care about possible future consequences, if that is all you care about, then this is probably right for you.  3) Find a qualified lawyer experienced with NFA gun trusts and have him create a proper trust for you. This is the best option if your primary concern is not cost but things like: What really happens to my firearm collection when I die? What if I become incapacitated? How about my children? How can I protect my firearms from possible future legal changes? Just to list a few questions...  This route gives you a lawyer who is qualified to handle these types of trust, to talk to in person both before and after creating such a trust, you can go to later on with changes and updates to the trust, you can consult if the laws change to find out how the changes might affect them and take the necessary steps, etc.   If you want security, certainty, qualified advice, a reliable resource, then go with this option."

NFA,3b436c,cawpin,3,Thu Jun 25 22:01:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not a lawyer but here is what I know about these things:  While we talk about ""gun trusts"" there really is no such thing.  They are trusts set up for the purpose of possessing guns and NFA items.  As long as it is a valid trust in your state it should be good to go.  The gun specific language usually included in ""gun trusts"" is not necessary.  It's included to help clarify.  A prohibited person cannot take possession of a gun, it doesn't matter what language is or is not included in the trust.  That language is there to A. Make it look like the attorney put in some extra work and B. Clarify things for the dumbass who would think a prohibited person could possess a gun because ""its not his, its the trusts"".  Before "" gun trusts"" were available from every other gun website and any lawyer was willing to draw one up people would go get a form trust from an office supply store, fill it out, get it notarized and start buying shit.  These trusts are still good to go unless you screwed up from the start.  I am a fan of going to an attorney for a trust but it's important to understand a ""gun trust"" isn't really any different than any other revocable living trust.  If I were you I would ask about getting it revised to include more instruction about what would happen if you are incapacitated or become a prohibited person but my guess is legally what you have is good to go.  And don't forget I'm a random stranger on the internet who has no idea what your state laws are and has not been to law school.  I highly suggest you talk to your attorney about your concerns, if he is a Wills, Trusts and Estates guy I'm sure your trust is valid, just very basic.  You may want to find some examples of language used in ""gun trusts"" regarding age, prohibited persons and gun laws and ask if he would be able to work some of that language or something similar into the trust document."

NFA,3b1kp7,XA36,2,Thu Jun 25 16:05:26 2015 UTC,"By what mechanism? They do that already with the NFA. If the NFA is gone, then the law by which they levy such a tax is gone. I know it doesn't seem like it sometimes, but the government can't just arbitrarily throw a tax on whatever kind of item or transaction they want. There has to be a law that permits that kind of tax. It has to be passed by Congress, signed by the president, etc. And presumably in the fantasy world where there is sufficient political will in the country to repeal the NFA, then a proposal to add back a tax that was just repealed won't have much traction."
NFA,3b1kp7,NonProphetTacks,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:47:01 2015 UTC,"Logic says you're correct, but the reality is companies charge significantly more for SBR versions today for no reason other than people will pay it."
NFA,3b1kp7,McFeely_Smackup,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:51:01 2015 UTC,"for no reason other than people will pay it.   You say that like you think it negates the basic argument of ""market economics."" That's all market economics is; what are people willing to pay.  But the reason they can get away with that is that when you add $200 right off the bat and a 4-month wait because of the tax stamp, then it becomes far more like a luxury item instead of a ""budget"" item, and the demand curve changes significantly when that happens.  The reason they can get away with that now is still just because of the NFA. Get rid of the NFA, and you'll find factory SBRs for the same price as factory carbines."
NFA,3b1kp7,NonProphetTacks,4,Thu Jun 25 18:51:14 2015 UTC,"In the event of no more NFA I disagree with you. I think they would be almost the same cost as semi and if large companies don't do it someone will fill in and make a bunch. Apparently, pre Hughes FA was a couple hundred more then semi and if we take it back to NFA (the first one) it would be unimaginable."
NFA,3b1kp7,trashythrow,3,Thu Jun 25 07:03:24 2015 UTC,"I think it would be expensive as shit at first. Then once the demand died down, the price would drop significantly.  Eventually, it'd be just like buying another gun."

High shelf/low shelf doesn't matter (for a sear conversion, does matter for a RDIAS) but almost any off the shelf lower won't just accept a sear by drilling the third hole."
NFA,3b1kp7,Bigfrank87,0,Sat Jun 27 14:45:14 2015 UTC,"You also need the F/A FCG as well, but the biggest issue is the risk you take with this approach.  10 years in Federal prison (never mind the huge fine that can come with the long sentence) and losing your right to own a firearm when you get out is pretty harsh."
NFA,3b1kp7,WildBTK,2,Thu Jun 25 14:42:08 2015 UTC,We are talking in context of the NFA being removed and the guns still being exorbitantly expensive.  I do not condone manufacturing illegal machine guns.  This is a hypothetical discussion.
NFA,3b1kp7,the_doubter,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:41:34 2015 UTC,His point was that the cost of machine guns is artificially inflated and there is nothing inherently expensive about making them.
NFA,3b1kp7,dookie1481,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:45:08 2015 UTC,"Let's clarify: prices are artificially inflated by 922(o) of the GCA, not the NFA; the NFA has almost nothing to do with MG prices (a $200 tax on a $6000 MG is noise in the equation).  However, given the circumstances, MG prices are reflective of supply and demand.  It has taken almost 30 years for prices to reach where they are now; they didn't spike overnight (well, maybe immediately after May 19, 1986 they did).  And, yes, the technology to physically construct a MG is well-known and understood and has been for decades and is little or no more expensive than S/A parts."
NFA,3b1kp7,WildBTK,3,Thu Jun 25 16:06:05 2015 UTC,"Disagree.  There are SOOOO many companies that make AR type platforms that the sheer number of competitors would keep prices down.  Of course, the only difference on an AR platform between S/A and F/A is the trigger group and one additional hole drilled on the receiver for that sear.  So, the cost is nothing.  Alternatively, people would presumably be able to use DIASs."
NFA,3b1kp7,WildBTK,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:37:46 2015 UTC,them being expensive was just a maybe. like that would keep everyone from having them. not likely since anyone could easily make lightning links or whatever but there would be something keeping FA in the hands of just anyone that can pass NICS
NFA,3b1kp7,second_ary,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:58:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed on this point.  If we simply got rid of 922(o) in the GCA, MG prices would drop dramatically literally overnight.  That's a much more feasible alternative than repealing the NFA altogether, but this is a tangential discussion to the main point.  And even though I am someone that bought a RR M16 last year, I would cheerfully support removing 922(o) from the GCA.  Yes, I would lose my investment monies, but I would gain much more in terms of freedom to make more MGs."

NFA,3appm5,jayemo,2,Mon Jun 22 15:25:51 2015 UTC,"You're under no obligation to notify the BATFE of your new address as long as the move is within state.

Note shall is not a legal requirement and there is no law requiring you to inform them.   Edit: Remember, if there were a legal requirement there would be a law obligating stamp holders to inform the BATFE of an address update.   e.g. Take a look at BATFE Form 5320.20, the requirement to inform the BATFE of interstate transport.  The form itself says the legal requirement is in 18 U.S. Code §922(a)(4), which reads:     (a) It shall be unlawful— (4) for any person, other than a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector, to transport in interstate or foreign commerce any destructive device, machinegun (as defined in section 5845 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), short-barreled shotgun, or short-barreled rifle, except as specifically authorized by the Attorney General consistent with public safety and necessity;     If there were a legal requirement to inform the BATFE of an address change, there would be a law requiring it in the USC."

NFA,3appm5,_ak_,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:51:26 2015 UTC,"I took a closer look. ""Shall"" is used 9 times in the Form 1, in varying contexts. Here's a couple examples -   This approved application is the registrant’s proof of registration and it shall be made available to any ATF officer upon request.   I think everyone can agree that you are required to show an ATF officer upon request proof that you can legally possess an NFA item.   Any person who violates or fails to comply with any of the requirements of the NFA shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $10,000 or be imprisoned for not more than 10 years, or both.   Here it seems ""shall"" can mean ""may"" or ""will"".   Based on the ramifications of not complying with the NFA, I think it's prudent to take the five minutes to notify them of a change of address.  Edit: /u/_ak_ is right, no legal requirement to notify for an in-state move."
NFA,3appm5,cawpin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:24:24 2015 UTC,"Wasn't disagreeing, agreed it means you should inform them. Original comment suggested it wasn't required because of the word ""shall"" when it clearly reads that it is required."

NFA,3amx06,tromix1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:38:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I will check them out.  CZ barrels apparently require fitting.  When they fit a barrel, do they modify the barrel or the slide?   I was thinking of providing a spare barrel for the work and keeping a regular barrel for reasons.  That would only make sense of the spare barrel is altered and not the slide, since altering the slide would make the other barrel not fit.    tl;dr I am on crack"
NFA,3amx06,tromix1,2,Tue Jun 23 19:30:39 2015 UTC,"Thats outside my knowledge base. I know that barrels are not simply drop-in. Buying a second barrel, and having it modified makes little sense from a cost and effort perspective. If/when you get your factory barrel modified by ADCO, you'll have to remove the adapter if you want to remove the barrel. This is the price you pay for a CZ75b as a host. The adapter is easily removed and re-installed though. If you dont want to run a suppressor, just screw on the knurled thread protector that adco will provide with it, and call it good!"

Again, that barrel will NOT work for a suppressor.  To get a threaded barrel for your 75, I would contact CZ Custom, at www.czcustom.com, to see if they have any in stock, of I they will be able to make one for you.""

NFA,3aexri,fatherdeath,9,Sun Jun 21 03:17:23 2015 UTC,"Let me try to hit all the usual points in one post:       There is no federal requirement to carry any NFA paperwork, your state laws may vary.      People will insist ""it says on the form you have to carry your form 4""...it does not.  It says ""Proof of Registration:  This approved application is the registrant’s proof of registration and it shall be made available to any ATF officer upon request"".  That means you have to maintain it in your records, not produce it instantly.  Notice it says nothing about ""with your NFA item""...it is ONLY talking about the stamp, if you think it means you have to produce it instantly, then you better carry your stamp 24x7 because it says nothing about only needing to produce it when you're carrying your item.     What if your range requires it?  Don't shoot there.  I wouldn't show any of my private tax documents to someone at a gun range, and that's what a form 4 is.    But then I also don't let ranges tell me how many rounds I can load, or how fast i'm allowed to safely shoot.  I'm weird like that. Most importantly...your Form 4 is an EXTREMELY sensitive document.  It is a written record of the fact that you are a collector of NFA items, probably more than one, and a detailed address of where you store them, for most people that's their home.  That's the kind of document that should be locked in a secured place...not carried around copied in triplicate.  If you lose or have stolen a copy of your form 4, how are you ever going to feel safe again?       The idea that people carry around copies of their trust and form 4 for no good reason is horrifying to me.  Think about what you're doing and the possible consequences"
NFA,3aexri,McFeely_Smackup,2,Sat Jun 20 01:01:24 2015 UTC,"Horrifying?  It's a doc showing my trust name and address.  And many ranges do require it.

Both state that they can request to see paperwork.  They never do...but it's something I'd have to deal with as a member if they asked."

Same reason why silencerco started selling 9mm endcaps seperately, since they have some new 9mm muzzle brake that uses the 9mm octane endcap. So it has a use outside of being a suppressor part.  So yeah, I'm sure you can get someone to make you a shot glass shaped like a K baffle, but I wouldn't want to be on either end of that transaction is the ATF decides they don't like it. The Sig MPX muzzle brake for example."

Then decide if you want to get a trust, meaning you need to find someone to do this / do paperwork, or do it the regular way and go through the process. Either way, its a nice long wait and then once you get your stamp THEN you can configure the rifle how you want. Ill let others get into the details about the middle steps / do some Homework"
NFA,3a8hi6,greekplaya990,2,Thu Jun 18 01:46:11 2015 UTC,Alright so say that I buy a lower and just let it sit until I get my stamp back..can I still have a short upper in my possession as long as I don't assemble the gun?  So my understanding at this point is that after I buy and register the lower..I will fill out the paper work and send it in along with my $200.  I can then keep the lower in my possession until I get my stamp back as long as I dont assemble it into an SBR.  Once I get my stamp I can attach the upper to the lower and go to the range.  So according to most things I have read there is no need for me to return to someone with an FFL once my stamp is received..it will just be sent directly to me.  Does this sound about right?  One other question..do I need to engrave a lower if I just buy one from a manufacturer like AERO Precision or do I only need to engrave if I purchase something like an 80% lower?
NFA,3a8hi6,CantHearYou,3,Thu Jun 18 02:00:21 2015 UTC,"I'm by no means an expert here, but owning an AR pistol is completely legal so I don't see why you couldn't just build your AR pistol.  I would avoid buying a stock for it until you get your stamp back as adding a stock is what changes it from a pistol to a SBR.  Another thing of note is that if you go this route then you will need to register your lower as a pistol when you purchase it if you plan on using it as a pistol."
NFA,3a8hi6,greekplaya990,2,Thu Jun 18 12:23:28 2015 UTC,"Get this pistol buffer tube so that way you have a pistol with your short upper and things all match up for why you have an SBR so there's no intent that you are trying to be sly and make an SBR while you wait.

The FFL I bought my can through advised to get the one you want from the get-go. One of the workers there said he has a few cans that just sit in the safe because he wanted something quicker. He hasn't used them in years."
NFA,39z00a,WTFNameIsntTaken,4,Mon Jun 15 22:56:15 2015 UTC,A friend of mine has a 7 in barrel and a gemtech QD can with a 13 in yankee hill rail. Only like 3/4 in. of the silencer sticks out of the end of the rail.   The only time it gets too hot to hold is when he mag dumps. but a pair of mechanix gloves fixed that right away. And his magpul flips have held up just fine for over a year.
NFA,39z00a,cschultzy56,2,Tue Jun 16 00:59:08 2015 UTC,Perfect! 556 right? Apparently 300 BO heats up cans much much less.

NFA,39cmvw,stormbird87,11,Wed Jun 10 21:32:29 2015 UTC,I regret buying a 9mm can.  The .45 is much more versatile.  Give it some consideration before you buy.

NFA,39cmvw,DocTorrFabulous,5,Thu Jun 11 01:22:05 2015 UTC,"I disagree with much better. The metering for handguns is generally just a few dB different, more spread for rifles, but in general a slightly overbore can won't be bad."

NFA,39cmvw,DocTorrFabulous,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:27:48 2015 UTC,I don't think it's significant enough to buy two cans right off the bat. YMMV.

NFA,39cmvw,McFeely_Smackup,2,Thu Jun 11 01:10:14 2015 UTC,https://youtu.be/a0cMuEpVOuQ I guess the separate cans are the way to go...  I'd still start with the .45
NFA,39cmvw,jayemo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:37:53 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I did.  Started with the .45 and added on specific calibers later...at a faster pace than I intended

NFA,39cmvw,jayemo,0,Thu Jun 11 02:45:11 2015 UTC,"I've got an Osprey and a TiRant in 9mm.  I liked the osprey better on pistols, and use the tirant on my 9mm AR."

Both of mine are dedicated and don't use a mag block, one is  a Colt that uses permanently pinned magwell spacers and the other is a Double Diamond Glock mag lower (now being made by Quarter Circle 10 )  I really like the glock mag lower, even fewer things to lug to the range with me."

Digging their dedicated lower, in stock no less... Any complaints on it?   But damn does that shit up add up quick! 275 lower, 235 bolt, and 180 barrel is pushing 700 bucks.

NFA,39cmvw,McFeely_Smackup,3,Fri Jun 12 02:17:42 2015 UTC,Get the 45 tirant and a 9mm piston (adapter). There's some video where they tested the 9mm tirant vs the 45 tirant and the difference was negligible. More options that way!
NFA,39cmvw,DaSilence,2,Wed Jun 10 23:39:59 2015 UTC,"The difference is about 3db, which doesn't sound like much but represents double the sound pressure level.  It's significantly louder to the ear."

More importantly there is not a distinct demographic set overwhelmingly attributable to any of them.  For instance this line:  ATF: fuck yo trust, urrybody gon get CLEO check  actually parodies the stereotype of the clownish, aspirational gangster rather any specific race or ethnic group.  This is largely due to the exaggerated under-enunciation and grammar pattern.  Whereas this line:  us: lolwut, read 90,000 comments bitches. get summadat petitions. call muh congresses muffuggas.  Is intended as a swipe at the widely accepted image of overweight, under educated redneck alarmist neckbeard.  A good example would be someone on a scooter in WalMart with cankles and neck rolls crying about a refinished Mosin by saying something along the lines of ""muh heritage, muh history"".  Finally, this last part:  Congress: U mad ATF bro? Gonna have to defund all appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. Your move, executive branch.  Is a subtle, perhaps overly so, jab at the 4chan/9gag crowd owing entirely to its use of the signature phrase ""u mad bro"", which although originating in hip hop lyrics has been almost entirely eclipsed by its subsequent adoption by suburban internet denizens who've had too much sugar.

But, you have to accept that just because you don't want you and your interests associated with that humor, others will not mind a bit. Especially when it is one comment deep in a smaller gun sub, that would not be required to continue in the exact environment.   What the guy said was funny to me, not because I am laughing my head off over how ignorant some ethnic groups are when it comes to government procedure regarding weapons control. It was funny as it was a quick summary of a formal subject covered very informally in a humorous presentation. And I wasn't just avoiding regarding his comment as racist by using the term, ""PC."" Again, to me it is at worst mocking people who speak so informally and you may be assigning only certain races as being the only ones that do so.  I feel this issue stems from your association with gun rights etc. and experiencing negative feelings (anxiety of some degree, etc.) when envisioning this right being taken away from people not showing caution to flippant remarks that may endanger the public's view of gun-owner related communities. If so, I feel you, but I don't see that comment as a risk in this setting. If not, could I ask to be informed properly?"
NFA,38nx9b,slamsomethc,0,Fri Jun 5 19:47:54 2015 UTC,"There's a very strong negative stereotype of gun owners as OFWGs waiting for the race war. This is exacerbated by the dog-whistle racism in the comments on any article involving a black man being shot or arrested (dindu nuffin, etc) and we don't need that association.   If a black man came into the sub and saw that sort of novelty account, how do you think they would respond? When you say 'speaking informally' are you consciously avoiding the acknowledgement that the post was written to mock AAVE?"
NFA,38nx9b,DocTorrFabulous,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:07:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, I did agree some could be offended and could be right in feeling that way.   This perception of gun owners we're both aware of will ebb with the flow of time and change, and it already is. I know many people today that are surprisingly pro weapons. But, I do know opposition increases as well. I know as a whole we should uphold higher standards and it starts at the individual level, so maybe he shouldn't discuss things this way when it can be viewed as, ""being black=being stupid.""  Anyway, I meant to share my own personal views even with discussing different common community views. I am not consciously avoiding that this post was written to mock a certain group at all, I personally do not view it as a certain race's trait, but a larger culture than is comprised of many races today.   It may only be because of the people I've been around in life, and which parts of the entertainment industry I choose to expose myself to, etc., but I genuinely do not view that way of talking as being exclusive to the black community, but I am aware of the roots of it. Today though, so many people of different races and ages have accepted that culture as their own and enjoy the things about it they do. I know and am close with Mexican, White, Asian, Black, and a number of other people of varying races that could be caught speaking, ""thugishly,"" enough to fit in the same style of ""Thug TL;DR,"" we saw above.  Again, these are my personal views, but I am aware of larger group opinions of things and wish they wouldn't be that way, but will admit that the way to change that is by not encouraging even slight intolerance on all parties' parts. So, you are justified in feeling worried about offending others in a way that cause a backlash against gun rights, but I feel that in this particular instance I was not.  Anyway, I'm glad we could keep this discussion interesting and civil enough. I am also aware of the voting system at work here as well. I don't agree with how things are looking since we're both adding something I feel worth hearing, so you've got my upvotes :D"

NFA,388t85,sassycouple,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:10:13 2015 UTC,Signs of what exactly? No tube rupture. Sound signature does not change drastically if at all. New sig suppressors are designed by some solid people. That can has quite a bit of life left in it.
NFA,388t85,Floyd91,-1,Wed Jun 3 07:18:11 2015 UTC,Sound was probably leveled in video processing. Easy thing to do.  Just prior to 300rds you see dust/unburned powder so baffles are likely burning away. And it gets worse.  OTOH I suppose it could have gotten plugged with unburned powder which would have increased sound level and the amount of powder expelled.  Either way it would be either toast or a real bitch to clean out.   Sig is certainly in this whole hog.  I doubt you'll see any silencer mfr offer up a challenge video. This would have destroyed many if not all.

NFA,380apn,MyFishIsGold,5,Mon Jun 1 13:22:20 2015 UTC,"He's not saying it does count. He's saying an AR15 pistol over 26 inches can have a vertical grip because it can be classified as a firearm. This is the reason that in some states (Michigan is one i think), you can carry a less than 26"" AR15 pistol in your car, but over that and it's no longer considered a pistol, so it must be encased and unloaded.  The two posters at the start of this chain are over simplifying this without knowing what they're  talking about."

NFA,380apn,esrevinu,-3,Mon Jun 1 02:20:32 2015 UTC,"Nope, not at all. It's in a pistol configuration due to the barrel length, it doesn't matter if you can stretch a stock(or sig brace) out like that. It's not legal to put a regular stock on that, so no matter what you do that is a pistol or SBR, if you file a form 1. VFG on that turns it into an AOW."
NFA,380apn,slalomz,4,Mon Jun 1 01:54:21 2015 UTC,"It would be able to have a VFG and if the overall length is >26"". Adding a VFG would turn it into a ""Firearm"" instead of a pistol."
NFA,380apn,WildBTK,0,Mon Jun 1 01:58:30 2015 UTC,"It is an SBR if it has an overall length less than 26"" OR a BBL length less than 16"" IF there is a stock (or vertical foregrip) installed.  Since this setup is in a pistol configuration, adding a VFG to it will make it a SBR according to the NFA due to the barrel length.  Strangely enough, if you use an AFG (angled foregrip), like the one offered by MagPul, it would not change the classification.  Yes, the ATF says there's a difference between a VFG and AFG.  Stupid laws combined with a stupid agency..."
NFA,380apn,slalomz,2,Mon Jun 1 15:30:53 2015 UTC,"No, adding a vertical foregrip doesn't make something that is not a rifle a rifle.

But if he adds a VFG then that path in the flowchart changes, and now depending on his overall length (not barrel length) he either has an AOW subject to the NFA or a ""Firearm"". He was asking if based on his measurements he meets this 26"" requirement or not. It looks really close, but I think he's just under, so he can't put a VFG on his AR."

If it has overall length greater than 26"" and a VFG it's not a pistol anymore and it's not a NFA item (AOW) either. It would just be a firearm.  I did slightly mispeak in my original post in that it doesn't become a firearm instead of a pistol until you put the VFG on it. And you can't put a stock or shoulder either a firearm or a pistol so that doesn't have any relevance."

NFA,380g9f,CORDITE_FOR_DINNER,2,Mon Jun 1 03:14:18 2015 UTC,"This is partially correct. The ATF will allow ""temporary"" changes to the caliber and length, which means you can use any length or caliber of upper on your SBR'd lower, but you must be able to return the firearm to it's taxed configuration, meaning you have to keep an upper in the taxed length and caliber on hand.   Now, once your Form 1 has been approved, you can always change the configuration you originally taxed. Simply write a letter to the NFA branch of the ATF stating that you want to change the length and/or caliber of the Form 1. This does not result in a new $200 tax, and as far as I know you don't have to wait for approval to make the change, so long as you have notified the ATF, but IANAL and I have never gone through that process before."

After lots of reading I ended up with an Octane 45. The OD is the same as the Octane 9 but the 45 is like an inch longer a touch heavier. It is user serviceable so shooting 22lr through it would be fine. I'll  be using mine for 22, 9, 45, and 300blk sub sonic. For shooting 9mm, they now offer a 9mm end cap which brings the performance down around to where dedicated 9mm cans are."

I think if you have to own one it has to be an octane 45. 22lr to 45 acp to 300 blk. if you are gonna have a bunch then get each one tailered to the caliber. for 9mm only i would go osprey 9  dont go cheap. you are in for $200 and a long ass wiat so get something good. save up if you have to but you will hate yourself if you have to spend another 200 just to get what you originally wanted.

NFA,37z8ph,Burrneraccount,3,Sun May 31 17:36:49 2015 UTC,"MAC is running suppressor tests on the channel. They don't have the handgun tests up yet, but they'll be up eventually.  OSHA says that impulse noise should not exceed 140 dB to be considered hearing safe. The 5.56 and .308 tests that MAC has put up thus far are right on the line and you should still wear earpro.  As is the case with anything sound related, the air will have an effect on the noise that reaches your ear. Temperature and pressure can fluctuate from day to day, and will vary depending on your region. Knowing all of this, advertised reduction ratings will not be perfect.  All of that being said, if I had to shoot someone in a confined space without earpro, I will take a suppressor in a heartbeat."
NFA,37z8ph,chattytrout,3,Sun May 31 19:35:44 2015 UTC,"One thing to consider, noise at the muzzle is only one factor. Certain pistols (read striker fired) are louder since they unlock sooner and blow more gas out the chamber. Rifles in the semi flavor always have port noise, due to gas expansion out the chamber and gas tube. Piston rifles are louder than DI since they have both port noise, muzzle noise and piston gas noise. Those factors make semi auto rifles usually not safe. Most dB tests are worthless, you need to hear the cans in person IMO."

NFA,37z8ph,McFeely_Smackup,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:36:28 2015 UTC,"The .22 runs louder because it is supersonic. I've an Osprey .45 on a USP Tac, and the round hitting is louder than the operation of the firearm. Generally, look at 1,100 FPS, under this is subsonic, over is supersonic. You can get heavy subsonic 9mm rounds, but they aren't as prevent, and thus, expensive. The .45 is naturally subsonic. Dry, I'm about in the 130 to 133 range. OSHA states anything at or below 130 dB is ""hearing safe.""   Also, remember that the dB scale is exponential, 140 dB is 50 times louder than 135 dB."

Most of these form 1 solvent traps are for rifles.  If you want to build a pistol can. You're going to ne a booster setup like the Gemtech LID. With sale prices I've seen on the Octane 9 ($379) or Osprey ($399), I'd just do one of those at since you get a real warranty. The LID already puts you at $150, plus another $100 or so for the tube and endcap, then you need to figure out making your internals. Then you need to have it engraved which is easily $30-50.  As far as buying your parts before or after the stamp, as long as you're  not assembling it as a suppressor or making baffles, you should be fine."
NFA,37yoh3,MyFishIsGold,2,Sun May 31 15:15:30 2015 UTC,Read this ATF letter before you decide to go the oil filter route. http://i.imgur.com/Eh4Pe.jpg  If you decide to buy the adapter and register it you fill out and submit a form 1 to the ATF with $200.  If you buy something like the econocan the transferor fills out the front of a form 4 that you finish filling out and submit with $200.  If you go the trust route or the individual route will decide if you have additional paperwork.  If you form 1 it you will also have to have the adapter engraved with certain information required by the ATF.

So far I am pretty happy with the quality and the price. The guy also sent me the NFA Trust paperwork for free to efile where other people are charging $100 for it."
NFA,37yoh3,SilverBazooka10,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:08:59 2015 UTC,"Couple points. I have never heard it argued that these are better than 1000 dollar suppressors. Those are built with quality materials, tightly machined and offer a warranty. Also they are usually lighter and likely more accurate than a flashlight with baffles. The question is is whether of not those are worth the 1000 vs 3-400 with one of these kits. The other issue is that i would suggest that you look at sdtac. They have titanium and a wider variety of tubes. Takes a little more research but dor the same cost you will likely end up with a better overall suppressor"
NFA,37yoh3,tmpick,1 point,Sun May 31 16:52:34 2015 UTC,I thought the filter could be replaced.   Could they ever prove that it's not the original filter if you replace it and toss the old one?
NFA,37yoh3,brownsemen,1 point,Sun May 31 22:33:06 2015 UTC,"Sure, you can send it back to the manufacturer to have it replaced or pay another $200 to manufacture it yourself.  Every time you do it, if you follow the law.  Probably not if you remove the original serialized oil filter component and use a different one.  I wouldn't risk it for a $20 adapter and an oil filter.  I'd do the sdtac route if I was going to make a homemade suppressor."

I understand that I am only making it in one caliber (after the approval and engraving), and that temporary changes don't mean a thing and ATF only recommends notifying them of permanent changes.  However, it does seem that an existing manufacturer is intended to be listed under 4h, no?"
NFA,37ytsw,MyFishIsGold,1 point,Sun May 31 16:00:53 2015 UTC,"On my last Form 1 SBR, 4h is blank"
NFA,37ytsw,_ak_,1 point,Sun May 31 16:03:01 2015 UTC,The only problem I have with that is this:  Is there anything in the law REQUIRING this be filled out... Or is it just a recommendation?
NFA,37ytsw,_ak_,2,Sun May 31 16:05:45 2015 UTC,"There is no law requiring block 4h to be filled out.  The most relevant law is the USC, where the BATFE uses the Form 1 as the vehicle to register NFA firearms in accordance with 26 U.S. Code § 5841 (c). The BATFE may deny your form for a number of reasons depending on what you do, or do not put in block 4h.  They have been inconsistent in their approval process, which is what leads to heated and pointless debate on the internet. Most people have positive results leaving 4h blank."
NFA,37ytsw,cawpin,1 point,Sun May 31 18:18:14 2015 UTC,"This is where I'm torn.  I know many people use the ""barrel marking"" for the caliber... but I was going to do Full Trust Name, City, 2 letter state abbreviation, and 300 BLK as the engraving.  I just don't to fill out a Form 1 and run into any problems because I did not disclose some other form of marking."
NFA,37ytsw,_ak_,2,Sun May 31 18:48:04 2015 UTC,"There's nothing to be torn about.  You have right pieces of information, just engrave them and leave 4h blank. Worst case scenario the ATF examiner will put your Form on hold and send you a letter.  You can also check the status of it, and if there are any issues you can clarify over the phone with the examiner."
NFA,37ytsw,cawpin,1 point,Sun May 31 19:43:45 2015 UTC,You don't have to engrave the caliber.
NFA,37ytsw,_ak_,2,Sun May 31 18:58:27 2015 UTC,"You don't have to engrave the caliber.     Caliber is most definitely a required marking. From 27 CFR 479.102:     § 479.102 How must firearms be identified?  (a) You, as a manufacturer, importer, or maker of a firearm, must legibly identify the firearm as follows:   (1) By engraving, casting, stamping (impressing), or otherwise conspicuously placing or causing to be engraved, cast, stamped (impressed) or placed on the frame or receiver thereof an individual serial number. The serial number must be placed in a manner not susceptible of being readily obliterated, altered, or removed, and must not duplicate any serial number placed by you on any other firearm. For firearms manufactured, imported, or made on and after January 30, 2002, the engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) of the serial number must be to a minimum depth of .003 inch and in a print size no smaller than 1/16 inch; and (2) By engraving, casting, stamping (impressing), or otherwise conspicuously placing or causing to be engraved, cast, stamped (impressed), or placed on the frame, receiver, or barrel thereof certain additional information. This information must be placed in a manner not susceptible of being readily obliterated, altered or removed. For firearms manufactured, imported, or made on and after January 30, 2002, the engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) of this information must be to a minimum depth of .003 inch. The additional information includes: (i) The model, if such designation has been made; (ii) The caliber or gauge; (iii) Your name (or recognized abbreviation) and also, when applicable, the name of the foreign manufacturer or maker; (iv) In the case of a domestically made firearm, the city and State (or recognized abbreviation thereof) where you as the manufacturer maintain your place of business, or where you, as the maker, made the firearm;"
NFA,37ytsw,helix6,2,Sun May 31 19:44:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the original manufacturer already did so. You don't need to re-mark it."
NFA,37xwmj,fnkey,3,Sun May 31 09:03:39 2015 UTC,Yes.  If you make an SBR via an ATF Form 1  you need to engrave the makers info on the rifle. The NFA Handbook has more information on what must be engraved (chapters 6 and 7) and the full law that the NFA Handbook cites is in 27 CFR 479.102 - How must firearms be identified?
NFA,37xwmj,_ak_,1 point,Sun May 31 10:11:21 2015 UTC,"Ah, alright.  Thanks.  I'm assuming that a ""recognized abbreviation"" would allow me to use my middle initial instead of getting my whole name engraved, yeah?"

NFA,37xwmj,chon_danger,1 point,Sun May 31 22:34:02 2015 UTC,"My gun trust lawyer (who is also a registered class 3 manufacturer) said I do not have to get my trust name engraved on my firearm if I’m using a gun that already has a manufacturer and serial number engraved on. If I am making a gun from scratch (assuming I’m licenses to do so) I would then put my trust’s name on it.  So obviously this comes down to what you consider the ""manufacturer"". Although the status of the gun is changing to an NFA item the original manufacturer name and serial number does not change and can be used to on your form 1 and does not changed. I am changing the status of this firearm, I am not making a ‘new’ firearm. I think this opinion is further strengthened by the fact you could return the SBR to pistol configuration and have it removed from the NFA registry if you were so inclined.  I trust my lawyer and I think his interpretation of the NFA is sound and in the spirit of the law."
NFA,37wtpt,deaddevil,2,Sun May 31 01:40:04 2015 UTC,"What a trail of my patience this has been. I ordered this can December 26th, 2012 and finally got to pick it up May 16th of this year. I submitted my forms on January 20th using a trust and my check was cashed January 23rd. The Form 4 approved April 11th.   I know suppressor videos do not do justice to what they can really do but this gives you an idea of the sound suppression the Gemtech Viper can do. It almost reminds me of a dull .22 pop, quite an improvement over the loud boom of a .45. Overall I'm super happy with this suppressor. The locking mechanism is quite helpful in keeping it in place and is easy to setup and install. The can itself is light weight and makes aiming and firing much easier than just using the strap on the MAC."
NFA,37wtpt,tnorman9999,2,Sun May 31 01:48:11 2015 UTC,Does the can get hot where your hand is?
NFA,37wtpt,tnorman9999,3,Sun May 31 02:45:09 2015 UTC,Negative. That part is actually a sleeve that sits just off the can. That area acts like a heat shield and it slides to raise and lower the teeth that engage the locking ring on the barrel that keeps it from unscrewing.

I kinda doubt it is worth the cash if all you care about is noise reduction. Main pros are you can clean it and thus us it on 22s.

NFA,37mawe,FCBombardier,-1,Thu May 28 19:22:30 2015 UTC,I thought they stopped selling them that way. Do you have a link to buy one still sold this way? (Where the end user can replace the filter)
NFA,37mawe,eight_heads,1 point,Thu May 28 19:56:44 2015 UTC,"The filter adapter is being sold as a ""solvent trap"" for cleaning your firearms. Some people have filed a Form 1 on the adapter as a suppressor. According to the letter above, changing the filter could be considered changing out suppressor parts, which according to the letter is not allowed. I would suggest that you ask the ATF yourself, that way you at least have a response letter in your name and would have some possible legal standing if need be. The way I see it is it's too risky otherwise. That or just save up and get a well made suppressor."
NFA,37mawe,FCBombardier,1 point,Fri May 29 03:58:07 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, the only thing that must remain is the serialized part. How else can SilencerCo warranty my suppressors to a single, horrible baffle strike? They state that if I essentially blow it up they will replace all parts damaged as long as the serial number is intact. This is, of course, a one time thing.   Also, how could multi-caliber suppressors be allowed? You have to remove the buffer assembly and Nielsen device and replace it with an entirely different one."
NFA,37mawe,wckdwabbit,1 point,Fri May 29 16:46:41 2015 UTC,"The difference is that SilencerCo is a manufacturer, you aren't (most likely). A manufacturer can obviously manufacture the parts, but a Form 1 doesn't make you a manufacturer."

Swapping an upper is not a permanent modification which do not need letters to the NFA branch ""asking for permission."" If the change is permanent then you should notify the ATF in writing.  I would highly recommend investing in a good mag block based on my experience.  I now have the hahn dedicated and yet to experience an issue.

NFA,37lmf0,FCBombardier,1 point,Thu May 28 16:32:21 2015 UTC,"What is Rocksett? The only way I've heard to make a suppressor permanent is to pin it to the muzzle, and that's on a rifle where the barrel doesn't need to move. Depending on your pistol, if it's a Browning-style design, you'll need a Nielsen device to make it work. You may be able to make it permanent, but why? You can remove it and use the can on another pistol, if you like.   EDIT :  Just realized you are talking a 9mm AR platform. Yes, you could pin it to the muzzle, which would make it permanent and add however many inches to the overall length of the weapon. Theoretically, if you did this and it was 16 inches you would only need the tax stamp for the suppressor and not the SBR."

On my HK there is a bit of space there, so if she starts to unwind, I put an o-ring on there and torque it tight. It acts enough like a wedge or spring to keep it from coming unscrewed.

You can have whatever uppers you want as long as you have a legal way to assemble them. You also do not have to be able to return it to the registered configuration; it doesn't matter.

Whenever I've removed rocksetted muzzle devices we did it with liberal application of a blowtorch (and its gotta be hotter than hell, that's the point of rocksett, it doesn't break down with heat) and a crap ton of torque. Don't do that.  If you're thinking that you want it to be a permanent addition, why not do an 8.whatever"" barrel with a pinned 8"" suppressor for a 16"" OAL?  If you're doing a form 1, then do your threads left handed, they'll be much less likely to back off, and buy a longer barrel and have a gunsmith cut it down to take the matching threads.

Then I held an Omega and talked to the guys at SilencerCo while at the NRA show and ordered one that next week.  Even if you shoot the Omega out on a short barrel they'll back you up.  They've said that on other forums.  They don't mess around on customer service."

NFA,37cxzs,NeverlandRancher,2,Tue May 26 18:41:22 2015 UTC,Good to know! My check cashed on 3/9 for an Octane 45 so it shouldn't be long now.  What other 300blk hosts did you look at before getting the Handi Rifle? I want to do an ar sbr upper but think I'd rather get a Handi rifle or model 7 instead on account of them being a bit quieter and a lot slower consumption rate at the range.
NFA,37cxzs,jayemo,1 point,Wed May 27 00:40:03 2015 UTC,"I honestly didn't consider any others haha. As I dropped quite a bit on a few suppressors, I wanted something cheaper. I've always wanted something in 300 blk and I can always get an upper for the AR in the future."
NFA,37cxzs,jayemo,2,Wed May 27 01:13:38 2015 UTC,Ah yea good point on the cost. Cheapest model 7 I've seen is around 650 while the handi rifle is around 250 tops. What kind of optic/red dot do you use on yours?

NFA,371lus,Foxyboxysoxy,1 point,Sun May 24 04:10:19 2015 UTC,If your going to use the dip you should be aware that the resulting solution is extremely toxic. Lead acetate permeates skin and can cause acute lead poisoning.

NFA,371lus,jayemo,1 point,Tue May 26 00:18:20 2015 UTC,"Many will downplay it, but lead acetate is nothing to be fucked with. Lead is normally not a MAJOR concern since it is bound up as an oxide (read not very reactive), but acetates are notoriously soluble. Skin contact WILL lead to some exposure, where as touching lead metal will likely not, especially if your not ingesting it. If you have the proper safety equipment (labcoat, mask, rubber gloves), and a environmentally friendly means of disposal, go for it. Problem is, most of the people doing this with their suppressor are not conscious of the environmental impacts (dumping it down a drain, or in the trash) nor the health effects. I'm more paranoid than most, because I'm a physiology PhD student. I work with potassium cyanide in the lab and lead exposure still rustles my jimmies. Hoppes worries me way less, sure there are some no bueno organics in hoppes, but soluble heavy metals have too many horror stories. Do the dip, but know the risks, and treat it like it should be treated."

But people seem to forget that Quiken has a top notch team that writes these trusts. And a word of advice, when you exaggerate the problem, it undermines other parts of your argument. A lot of people here have used Quicken. A lot of people have gotten forms back recently. A lot of people here have never had an issue. If this was a ""huge problem lately,"" you think you might have one or two people piping up - but you don't."
NFA,36oa2u,whubbard,0,Fri May 22 04:37:46 2015 UTC,"It's easier than a 4473.   Properly drafting a gun trust without using a DIY like Quicken? No it is certainly not.   Mine doesn't have any firearm specific language.   You're right and many don't, and you may have had some success with it, lets hope it stays that way.   Quiken has a top notch team that writes these trusts.   But not GUN trusts. And if you get them on the phone the second you mention ""gun trust"" you'll probably get crickets.   you think you might have one or two people piping up - but you don't.   Like I said we've (Texas) had this problem with folk's trusts before. I'm not trying to sensationalize the problem. It has happened and it will happen again. I haven't had one in a while so maybe I shouldn't have said ""lately"", the last denial for something like this was probably 6+ months ago. But still, this is an easily avoidable situation and not that much more expensive in the first place. If you're going to draft your own trust at least have it reviewed by a lawyer, which may end up costing as much as if he had just written you one anyway."

The vast majority of our government does not want us to have firearms or NFA items so they make it a headache and expensive.   Think about this. An aluminum tube with a threaded cap and an open cap. maybe $40 in machining and parts... $200. dont like it enjoy losing up to 10,000 and 10 years of your life.   there is no such thing as a voluntary tax. that is known as a donation. i pay $200 because I dont want to live behind bars. hell effectively I am just bribing the government not to arrest me for possessing a silencer."

Also, when you insure an item with UPS, there is nothing on the label that is printed out indicating what is inside the box, nor are you required to explicitly tell the clerk what is inside the box unless it is actually a firearm.   I agree with you that this situation was almost certainly due to an employee of whatever shipping outlet (it could have been a UPS store, which is not actually a UPS employee) he/she visited didn't know what was prohibited and what was allowed, but the point still stands that the situation could have been avoided completely by not explicitly stating what the contents of the package was.

If you go a qd can then you can get a 30 cal can brake that has 1/2""-28 threads and if you got anything bigger you could get brakes/flash hinders in 5/8-24"" and swap the one can.

If you can hunt suppressed, one supersonic round won't hurt. If you are alone at a range plinking, you'll probably be fine. When you start to run drills, you'll want ear pro.

Sucks for those wanting 30 day eFiles..but good for those wanting faster Form 4s.  Both still beat waiting almost a year.  I don't complain much about a 90 day wait on a Form 4.

NFA,35rb2v,NonProphetTacks,0,Wed May 13 01:38:12 2015 UTC,"The essence of the trust is to simplify owning NFA items. Just because you can have items transferred into the trust by multiple people (and it's unambiguously legal and proper to do that) doesn't mean it's a good idea.   The items held in the trust are for the specific benefit of the grantor, so he does ""own"" them, he just owns them indirectly (the trust owns the guns, and he controls the trust)."
NFA,35rb2v,Roeschu,1 point,Wed May 13 02:32:40 2015 UTC,"For me the purpose was to simplify owning the items but also it definitely was so that my father and I could purchase things and both be legally allowed to use and possess the same items.  Otherwise I would not have bothered to name him as a trustee.  I'm not really sure why this would be a problem and it was explained to me as one of the benefits of having a trust.  Also, if something were to happen to either of us there would be no need for any other transfers or whatever nfa red tape you have to go through to keep the stuff.

NFA,35rb2v,NonProphetTacks,1 point,Wed May 13 02:52:59 2015 UTC,"It's a perfectly fine arrangement to have two people's items in the same trust, as long as everyone is getting along.

Of course I'd still check for concentricity before I fire it, and I wouldn't rely on an adapter for a dedicated 30 Cal can.  Either way, I'll go back and look at how both options price out depending on what all I want to put this can on."

NFA,35luq4,andywu2334,5,Mon May 11 15:53:53 2015 UTC,"Your trust doesn't own any property, yet. But you need to finance it. Some people show $1. I personally put $100 Bank Reserve Note into mine."
NFA,35luq4,Roeschu,3,Mon May 11 17:36:59 2015 UTC,"In other words, use your assignment sheet, and assign ""something"" to it (like a $2 bill) and keep it with the trust.  Now your trust is funded.    Now you can buy things on a form 4 and add them to your trust as they are released from jail."
NFA,35luq4,turnoffable,2,Mon May 11 18:55:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not a lawyer, but I don't know that I buy the line of thinking that you have to ""fund"" the trust with a trivial amount of money before you can transfer anything else to it.  I executed the trust document with a notary, and completed an assignment page contenporaneously. The assignment page had the NFA item I was obtaining on it (I waited until my dealer had the approved Form 3 in hand). There was never any cash in my trust."
NFA,35luq4,NonProphetTacks,1 point,Mon May 11 19:36:44 2015 UTC,I have a form 1 and form 4 done at the same time on a none funded trust. Both were approved without issue.
NFA,35luq4,joe0121,4,Mon May 11 19:52:12 2015 UTC,"The issue is not whether ATF thinks your non-funded trust is valid, or whether they've issued your stamps.  The laws of many states require that a trust own property at the time of its creation...that's why it's very common for a trust to be funded with currency (whether it's $1 or $100).  The issue is this: when you die, your trust may be examined to be sure it's in compliance with state law.  If not, that's obviously not a good things for your beneficiaries."
NFA,35luq4,jklandon,1 point,Mon May 11 20:15:44 2015 UTC,"Sure, but it doesn't have to be cash. I transferred a silencer, which I had already paid for on behalf of the trust, but for which I hadn't yet received approval to take possession, on the same day and at the same time that I executed the trust.  The only conceivable way that it could made a difference is if you execute the trust first, wait a while, and then execute the assignment page to transfer the property. So if you just want to create the trust to get that settled and out of the way then go shopping for NFA items later, then it couldn't hurt to transfer $1 or a $2 bill or whatever into the trust at the time that you execute it.  But even if you didn't, there's the legal concept of substantial compliance or substantial performance. The courts give overwhelming deference to your intent when you create a legal document, and will correct simple trivial defects in the document itself. It would be extremely difficult for someone to argue that because you didn't first transfer a $1 bill to the trust first that you didn't actually intend for it to be a legal entity that holds your NFA items, and that another, alternative outcome should be upheld instead.  Sign the trust and the assignment page on the same day (preferably on the same day your dealer also sends your first Form 4), and there's nothing to worry about."
NFA,35luq4,NonProphetTacks,1 point,Mon May 11 20:47:38 2015 UTC,"The likely hood that you are able to do that in the same day isn't always possible. Also from what I recall, funding your trust with an NFA item that you aren't legally able to possess (yet) isn't a way to fund the trust. Because if it were to come back and not be approved and are in a state that requires it, you have failed to meed the obligations. Hence why most people add money to it so that it has been funded with something."
NFA,35luq4,Roeschu,0,Mon May 11 22:01:31 2015 UTC,"The likely hood that you are able to do that in the same day isn't always possible.   Why is that unlikely? Dealer receives the approved Form 3, sends you the serial number, take the trust to a notary to have the trust and assignment page signed on the same day. Where's the complication? You're signing documents anyway.   Also from what I recall, funding your trust with an NFA item that you aren't legally able to possess (yet) isn't a way to fund the trust.   {{Citation needed}}"
NFA,35luq4,NonProphetTacks,1 point,Mon May 11 22:13:32 2015 UTC,I shall repeat myself. The likely hood that you are able to do that is the same day ISN'T always possible.  No citation needed. How can you fund something without having tangible property?
NFA,35luq4,Roeschu,0,Mon May 11 22:39:55 2015 UTC,"And I'll repeat myself. There's no reason you shouldn't be able to do both the trust document and the assignment page at the same time in most circumstances. If you haven't had a dealer Form 3 your item yet, then there's no compelling reason to execute the trust yet.  And you have tangible property: your NFA item. You own it once you pay for it. Your ATF stamp isn't a title document. It's a permission slip to possess it. You can own something you don't currently possess. Otherwise how could you ever leave your house without ceding your interest in your house and personal belongings?"
NFA,35luq4,NonProphetTacks,1 point,Mon May 11 23:40:23 2015 UTC,Not everyone does a form 3.   You own your house. Your property. You also have access to it. Do you have access to your silencer? Hence why I am not considering it.
NFA,35luq4,Roeschu,1 point,Mon May 11 23:54:43 2015 UTC,It is state dependent..    Arizona statute states...  14-10401. Methods of creating trust  A trust may be created by:  1. Transfer of property to another person as trustee during the settlor's lifetime or by will or other disposition taking effect on the settlor's death.  2. Declaration by the owner of property that the owner holds identifiable property as trustee.  3. Exercise of a power of appointment in favor of a trustee.

NFA,35ab0y,Roeschu,8,Fri May 8 12:58:17 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of things going on from a tax perspective.  First, your trust isn't generating any income. It's assets, so far, consist of a silencer and a SBR, there are no securities or income-generating assets. So there's no income to include. The tax stamps are not deductible at all as taxes on either your personal income tax return nor the trust's income tax return (if it was going to file a return at all, which it won't, more about which later). If your NFA items appreciate in value (Ha!) and you sell them for a gain, then you may have some income, but that's solved by the second thing that's going on ...   ... your NFA trust is a Grantor Trust, meaning the person who created the trust (you, the grantor) is also the primary trustee and erstwhile beneficiary. Such trusts are disregarded for tax purposes. So even if your NFA items appreciate in value (Ha!) and you sell them, that income will be taxable to you.

Of course, they are all cheaply made 80s stuff (they were $75 in the 80s, so I am told by my Class 3 dealer).  I own a M11/9 (paid $6k for the bare gun) and have the Lage Max 11 MK2 upper and 22 conversion kit (another $1800 or so).  I also put in an order for the Max 31 MK2 upper because a 71 round drum magazine is just too much fun NOT to have.  :-)"

NFA,3576bq,WildBTK,3,Thu May 7 23:16:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, this would've been before the 1986 ban, of course.  They were about $400 in the early 90s I was told.  2011-2012, they were about $3-4k, now they are $5-7k.  It's a decent rate of return.  :-)  The biggest weakness of the M11 are the magazines.  It's seems hard to find a good magazine that will reliably feed."

NFA,3576bq,scrubadub,2,Fri May 8 03:54:07 2015 UTC,"Almost all the wear on a MG is in the (usually) replaceable upper. You can even buy new FA fire control parts without breaking laws.  If something breaks off on your lower you would have to get it re-welded. I think the main worry is pinholes getting bigger on aluminum lowers, since that seems harder to fix"

NFA,3576bq,bytelevel,3,Thu May 7 20:11:07 2015 UTC,"A STEN is also in your price range, but the M11/9 is the best to start with. My advice? Skip any M11/9's that have sten conversions done to them - it's better to stick to the factory magwell and use shockwave z-mags. Pick up a Lage upper or three (nobody has mentioned the soon-to-be-released MAX-11K). Prefer buying a used gun vs. a new in box gun. The boxed ones cost more and are more likely to need some work. Finally, beware the many, many scams on Sturm and subguns. I've snagged some great deals from those sites but for a first buy I suggest going with a well established dealer."

The good news is that the M11/9 is about the most common MG out there and they aren't hard to find. If I were buying from a dealer I'd feel comfortable, even if it was a small outfit.

Now I have one 22 can and looking at getting another.  22 cans are cheap and the ammo is cheap, so you'll probably use it the most.  I guess it really just depends on what kind of shooting you're going to do."
NFA,35791p,grundlepus,2,Thu May 7 20:36:55 2015 UTC,If you only had enough to budget ONE can purchase what can would it be?  And why would it be the Octane 45?
NFA,35791p,fadelio,2,Fri May 8 05:02:10 2015 UTC,"It would probably still be the Mystic.  I can shoot it on my 10/22 and 22/45 Lite (22LR), my AR-15 (5.56), my VZ2008 (7.62x39), and my P226 MK25 (9mm).  I plan on building a 300 Blackout SBR and I will be able to shoot subs and supers through the Mystic, even full auto if I could afford an M16.  If I ever decided I wanted a 5.7x28 FN, or a 17 HMR, or a 6.8 SPC, or a 6.5 Grendel, or a 5.45 X 39 it could handle those too.  Hell, it will handle subsonic 308 Win.  It suppresses over 50 calibers, it is probably the best ""do-all"" can.  I don't shoot 45.  I am happy with the terminal performance of 9mm, and suppressed subsonic 9 is much quieter than suppressed 45.  That is why the Mystic works for me, but if you need to suppress 45 it won't help you out (until they come out with a 45 Mystic)."
NFA,35791p,grundlepus,1 point,Fri May 8 12:28:34 2015 UTC,http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2014/10/foghorn/silencer-review-liberty-mystic-x/  A link to a review with a video.    Would you mind listing the reasons you'd recommend a Mystic over the Octane for a first time can buyer who is primarily going to shoot .22lr and 9mm? I was sold on the Octane 45 until you posted about the mystic.
NFA,35791p,fadelio,1 point,Fri May 8 15:56:22 2015 UTC,"If I were only going to buy one can it would be the Mystic.  I thought I was only going to buy one can when I first bought it... then I caught the NFA bug.  I still like the Mystic, but I kinda wish I had just bought a 22 can, an Osprey or an Octane (or a TiRant, still can't decide), and a 30 caliber can.  The Mystic can do all of those, but I like the QD you can get with a 30 caliber can (well, you can do that with the mystic but it requires a HATE ring from Liberty and a MAAD mounting module from Silencerco and that is an addition $400).  I don't want my AR barrel to have  a just thread protector on the end when I'm not shooting the can.  The Mystic is also heavier than all the other popular pistol cans (although it can arguably suppress a little better).  22 cans are nice because they are small and light (and cheap compared to center fire cans).   Right now I have the Mystic and the Kodiak TL, a 22 can.  Eventually I'll probably have another pistol only can like the Osprey, and a 30 cal can like the Omega or the Dead Air Sandman-S.  So I will eventually have a dedicated rimfire can, a pistol can, and 30 cal can and one that can hop between all three.  If you think you are just going to buy one suppressor, the Mystic will handle 9mm and 22 and it will sound great.  But if you think more cans are in your future you should decided if you want one can that can pull double/triple duty at the beginning with the Mystic, or if you want to hop right into the dedicate cans."
NFA,35791p,grundlepus,1 point,Fri May 8 17:11:11 2015 UTC,I'm going to like cans and get more. Should I just get a dedicated .22 first?  Or the Octane or the mystic?
NFA,35791p,fadelio,1 point,Sun May 10 04:08:32 2015 UTC,I can't decide that for you.  It really depends on what you think you are going to shoot the most.  Best thing I can recommend doing is trying to find a demo day nearby and try them before you buy them (easier said than done depending on where you are located).
NFA,35791p,grundlepus,1 point,Mon May 11 12:41:57 2015 UTC,Which exact can are you running? I wasn't aware they had a pistol can rated for 5.56. I might be interested in this.   According to their website 5.56 isn't listed on the 9mm can.  Silencer shop shows the mystic x and it's not listed for 5.56 or 7.62x39 super.
NFA,35791p,axis_z,1 point,Fri May 8 14:57:04 2015 UTC,"The Mysitc, the version they have out now is the Mystic X.  It is their multi-caliber can but 9mm is the base caliber.  It can handle 5.56 through a 16"" barrel but no full auto, only a reserved rate of fire.  When you see the heat mirage with 5.56 you are supposed to stop shooting until it cools down.  Check out the caliber list here."

In my head I'd like to think that given the extra volume and larger bore, maybe more of the nasty shit actually makes it all the way out of the can. Though I'd also like to think that running a few mags of 45 through it afterwards could blow any crap out too or no difference?   Just get the 9mm end cap or 22 end cap if they bring them to market and save a couple bucks.   They're already in wild via silencer shop for a cool 60 bucks. edit, had skipped over ""22 end cap"". That would be sweet but doubtful. I think they're getting by with the 9mm version because there is some ""blast shield"" type device that they make that happens to take 9mm end caps thus is not a dedicated silencer part."

NFA,35791p,fadelio,2,Fri May 8 18:03:19 2015 UTC,"Haha at, ""too much air"", more volume for expansion is typically better for suppression. See my other reply with the silencer shop testing it.

I knew about the 9mm end caps back in February when I got to hold the individual wrapped ones at my local dealer. They almost let me buy one right then and there but they double checked and it wasn't legal at the time so no transaction was made but I knew they were coming out once the pistol muzzle brake passed the ATF approval.

I gotcha, I would do it purely for the ""why not"" factor and not on a full time basis especially since I already have dedicated 22 cans.   pistol muzzle brake    Bingo, that was the phrase I was looking for. The fact that they can skirt the definition of suppressor parts like this just further proves how asinine the whole system is. With that said, I'll definitely be picking up a 9mm cap since I currently don't have a 45 host."

NFA,35791p,jayemo,1 point,Fri May 8 04:06:38 2015 UTC,The sr22 and spectre 2 were my friends. We did it just to test and see. Yes the weight makes a big difference but I don't really shoot 22lr anyway.  The only 22lr I have is an old bolt action that has sentimental value from my old man and I'm not going to thread it.

When you go to pick it up when the Form 4 is approved, the dealer is still going to have you complete a Form 4473 and run a NICS background check (because the silencer is a ""firearm"" for this purpose, and he's an FFL), and it may come up at that point.  If your father does the Form 4473, then that solves the administrative problem of having the possession charge come up, but if that charge was punishable by a year or more in prison (even if you actually received a lesser sentence), then you are a ""prohibited person"" and can't possess the silencer.  Do some homework, see what the maximum sentence for that charge was. If it was less than a year, then you don't have anything to worry about. Having your father do the paperwork under his name prevents any kind of problems with the process and you'd still be legal.

NFA,353bh3,PrometheusSmith,8,Wed May 6 19:25:25 2015 UTC,"My guess is that he doesn't understand the NFA very well. First, that lower would have to have been sold to him as a ""pistol"" or ""other"", which may or may not have happened. If it was barreled as a rifle when he purchased it, he cannot legally convert it to a pistol without going through the NFA.  Second, and more glaringly, he has a rifle stock buffer tube on that lower and pictures the stock with it. That seems extremely questionable and likely something the ATF would consider constructive intent.   If he does have SBR paperwork for that firearm, then he would legally be allowed to configure it as such, but AFAIK he would have to sell it as a normal length rifle or transfer it on a Form 4 to be able to sell it again, since it would have been registered as a rifle at that point and could not be converted back to a pistol.  But, IANAL."
NFA,353bh3,osprey413,4,Wed May 6 19:42:15 2015 UTC,Constructive intent is not a thing.
NFA,353bh3,cawpin,3,Wed May 6 21:51:56 2015 UTC,"Constructive Possession then. You are being pedantic.   It boils down to the theory that a prosecutor could and would argue that even though the parts weren't configured in an illegal fashion when they caught you, they probably would have been if they had caught you at a different time.   In this specific case, assuming the seller has no other AR platforms around, the prosecutor would argue that there is no other legal way for the seller to use the stock other than make an illegal SBR (and with a picture of the ""pistol"" with a rifle buffer tube, and the detached collapsible stock next to it, it would be pretty damn easy for the prosecutor to argue that it was the intent of the seller to configure in that fashion).  The possession of an illegal SBR is ""constructed"" legally by the prosecutor, despite it not being in an illegal configuration in the picture. By ""constructing"" the SBR the prosecutor has shown the seller's intent to create an illegal SBR by having the parts necessary to do so (and as far as the picture is concerned, only those parts, so no other legal configuration exists)."
NFA,353bh3,osprey413,7,Wed May 6 23:07:14 2015 UTC,The only way you are getting charged with this is if you get caught committing a crime with your illegal SBR.  It's an extra stick to beat people with when they fuck up.  Or post pics of it on the Internet.

Such weapons must be registered and are subject to all requirements of the NFA.   IMNAL either, but having these two items displayed in the photo like that seems to fall into that category."

Or, selling them all the parts necessary to build and SBR and charge them based on constructive possession. Either of which would probably give them justification to rummage through any other firearms you may have, and if you are willing to buy one firearm that is of questionable legality, you very well may have other questionable items (one of those oil filter attachments comes immediately to mind)."
NFA,353bh3,DaSilence,1 point,Thu May 7 00:10:14 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind that I am not a lawyer, but that would seem like it would be entrapment. Both pieces are legal, and it would be very hard to prove that the buyer actually had intent to combine them. Maybe the hypothetical buyer has a carbine that he broke the stock on, and he wants to use the pistol as a pistol.  If it was a WTB posting I could see it being a trap though.   In any case, the ""pistol"" is gone from the site, taken down by the seller."

NFA,353bh3,WildBTK,1 point,Fri May 8 01:19:56 2015 UTC,"IANAL either, but my understanding is that entrapment is when the police coerce someone to commit a crime that they otherwise wouldn't commit. In order to get around this I would imagine they would get the buyer to admit to why they were purchasing the gun in the hopes that they say that they are going to make it into an unregistered SBR or that they already have an unregistered SBR. That would prove that they were going to commit the crime, they just needed the parts to accomplish it.  This is similar to terrorism stings, where the government supplies a terrorist with a bomb or a weapon because they had already stated a desire to commit a terrorist attack, and then bust them for having bombs and guns for a terrorist attack.   Just talking about it isn't a crime (or at least it is a harder crime to convict on), so they have to provide the actual means to commit the crime."
NFA,353bh3,cawpin,2,Thu May 7 01:15:24 2015 UTC,"Adding a stock to a rifle that has a barrel of less than 16"" or overall length less than 26"" is considered ""making"" an NFA firearm (SBR), thus requiring a tax stamp.  I honestly am not sure how ATF would react to a gun like this if the stock did not come with it.  So, constructive intent means that if you have the parts needed to assemble an unregistered SBR (or MG or AOW), even though it may not be in that actual configuration, the ATF will make the intent argument in court.  So, if you bought this gun and took it to the range without the actual stock added.  Then, somehow, you got the attention of the ATF and they raided your home and found the stock sitting on a shelf, they will assume you intended to make an SBR and prosecute for an untaxed SBR."

NFA,353bh3,XA36,2,Wed May 6 20:32:09 2015 UTC,"One of the many reasons the NFA in some respects is broken.  I own both AR pistols and rifles.  The law is not clear on whether I can have unused stocks laying around for my rifles while in possession of a pistol with a tube that could easily use said stocks.  In a nutshell I have to choose either to not do so which impairs my exercise of owning firearms and their associated parts or do so and take a chance on being prosecuted.  It is completely up to the ATF on whether the latter is illegal and their letters are only opinion.  Personaly I think the law at least insofar as it pertains to these situations should be void for vagueness as no one, not lawyers, nor even the ATF can definitively answer let alone a common person on what is illegal in that situation.  Best one can do is hope the ATF holds its word and doesn't change its mind which should be unlawful.    We shouldn't have to rely on a TLA  to determine whether an action is lawful especially if it can change its decision tomorrow and force a person through a lengthy and costly trial.  I almost wish the ATF would prosecute on some of this stuff if only to force a court ruling for everyone to know where the law stands.  Rolling the dice has no place when it comes to codified law."

The tax to manufacture a SBS is the same as to manufacture an AOW.  And by registering it as an SBS you have the option of putting a stock on it later if you want.
NFA,34yp8k,wckdwabbit,0,Tue May 5 19:20:11 2015 UTC,Aow I thought was $5 versus SBS at $200?
NFA,34yp8k,jayemo,3,Tue May 5 20:07:51 2015 UTC,"5 bucks is to transfer an already built aow I believe. So since you're manufacturing it, it's 200"
NFA,34yp8k,wckdwabbit,3,Tue May 5 20:15:12 2015 UTC,The tax to manufacture is $200 for both AOW and SBS (as well as SBR's and suppressors).  The cost to transfer an AOW is $5 and the cost to transfer a SBS is $200.  It doesn't make any since but this is the federal government we are talking about.
NFA,34yp8k,cawpin,2,Tue May 5 20:21:55 2015 UTC,and I was informed that the ATF no longer allows AOW on existing receivers    Informed by whom?

He said, that only new, never connected to anything receivers can be AOW and once they're tagged that way, they're always that way. like the serbu... if you modify a shotgun, even if you make it a serbu like it's an SBS and $200"
NFA,34yp8k,wckdwabbit,2,Tue May 5 21:19:53 2015 UTC,"I think he was talking about existing, traditional, shotguns that have had a stock. Because that isn't what the law or ATF says."

Emailed HTA on a Sunday night, got reply back Monday asking to ship it to them. Shipped it Tuesday and had it back the following week (USPS fucked around a lot, HTA only had it for a day then turned it back around).

I currently spray it with gun scrubber to get off major stuff, spray it with rem oil, let it sit, brush it, then hit it with rem oil again. It gets it mostly clean but stuff is starting to accumulate so I might use a soda blaster the next time I clean it."
NFA,34tmr6,wells08,2,Mon May 4 14:52:34 2015 UTC,"I do almost the same thing just no rem oil. I just spend a good while brushing it, lots of elbow grease. For the most part I just try to get the lead buildup removed as it gets harder the longer it sits for, other than that, powder residue is beneficial to sound reduction until there is too much, which is when you want to clean it.   You are most likely getting accumulation from the rem oil, Aluminum doesn't rust, it oxidizes so rem oil wont help in that regards. Also oxidized Aluminum is tough stuff, its put on grinding wheels for steel. Hopefully Thompson anodized the core to prevent oxidation, so for the most part, some cleaning product, elbow grease and a nice dry will have the suppressor running fine."

I towel it off once I'm content but the real culprit is probably the burnt up white lithium grease (micro can that is a bit loud when dry) hah  No idea if it is anodized.

Not only is it quieter, but there is no 'blast' from the high pressure gas exiting the barrel. I never realized how much that 'blast' made me get tired of shooting, because I had just gotten used to it or at least I thought I had.   Shooting with the can on all you really feel is the recoil, kind of like an oversized pellet gun. It is hard to explain, but you'll feel it immediately and it is really noticeable after you realize what the difference is.   Shooting subsonic loads through my 300blk is super quiet. Like sound of the action cycling only quiet. I'm hoping someone comes out with a 30cal bullet that performs at subsonic speeds as well as pistol caliber hollow points perform. I'll instantly switch to my 300blk for home defense when that hits the market, no need to worry about blowing out my ears shooting indoors in a defense scenario."

So definitely a good choice.   and I think that's worth the extra ~month it'll add to the wait time.   I think Form 3s are having a 2-3 month window for approvals.

NFA,34m7wb,ClemsonStang,1 point,Sun May 3 11:14:04 2015 UTC,An advantage of ordering out of state is that it may contain cheaper and you avoid paying sales tax. Disadvantage is you add a few weeks till the form 3 clears and you have to pay you're local NFA dealers transfer fee. The local dealer has to charge enough to cover their expense of the paperwork and storing your item in their safe for 3-4 months. Not to mention putting up with sick customers calling every week to see it their form 4 has cleared yet. That is why many shops charge a higher transfer fee thanna basic firearm. Plus it may swing the pendulum in their favor on price.
