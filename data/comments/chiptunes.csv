Here's some of my babies from back in the day.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/jqezazm8fi3nmsl/img_0390.jpg?dl=0  Also also, I did pro-sound via the original port and actually prototyped a product with kitsch. It was called the lo-sound, and it was a high pass on a switch, like what DJs use before dropping the best.  Oh the memories :)"
chiptunes,3e1nmu,BaronVonBarbasol,3,Tue Jul 21 07:11:07 2015 UTC,This whole album is great! Here is my track from this release: https://soundcloud.com/grazcore/graz-dragoon-underground

chiptunes,3dyob9,PlaceboWizard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:37:27 2015 UTC,"cool! as a suggestion, if youre using a program such as famitracker detune the channels slightly so they dont ""clash"" when they play the same note (even on different octaves!) and maybe take advantage of the expansion chips such as the VRC6 if you want to to possibly make it sound fuller without needing reverb, or use some arpeggios!  (in famitracker, to detune use the P effect: P80 is default, P81 detunes very slightly up, etc. just make sure to use hex numbers.)"

Problem was I'd made the .mid file first, so this was the only way to make it in that style from what I could tell, since I'm unfamiliar with any real trackers. If you have any suggestions I'd be happy to hear it."
chiptunes,3e03ey,PlaceboWizard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:55:53 2015 UTC,"try using famitracker, its pretty easy to pick up with a tutorial.  famitracker.com (downloads)  forums.famitracker.com  (we have forums!)"
chiptunes,3dyl39,defmem,2,Mon Jul 20 16:17:08 2015 UTC,I hate that I didn't know about Nanoloop for Android this whole time. I've been looking for LSDJ carts forever.
chiptunes,3dyl39,Corrom,2,Tue Jul 21 01:49:53 2015 UTC,"Its amazing! Well worth the couple of Â£/$ and it's an official port. Its not a carbon copy of the original, but it does some good shit. And I love the sampler on it especially"
chiptunes,3duqnh,NickN3v3r,2,Sun Jul 19 17:47:31 2015 UTC,"Bro, this is great.  A bit of amateur critique; the ending (where all sound dropped out for a sec) left me sad/wanting for more and felt a bit anticlimactic"

chiptunes,3dsk3o,Pencildragon,2,Sun Jul 19 01:20:19 2015 UTC,"This is one of my favorite pieces of chip music! I looked far and wide for a midi or sheet music for this piece, but came up completely dry. So I transcribed it myself and I'm sharing the sheet music with you guys too! Here:http://imgur.com/a/eNfDF  EDIT: I did not monetize this video(nor any of my videos actually), so I apologize for the ad. I can't dispute it as YouTube does not give me a relevant option to use to dispute it, but the wrong person has claimed it and the record company they belong to seems to no longer exist."
chiptunes,3dsk3o,ThePixelMouse,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:21:41 2015 UTC,"I found a MIDI. http://vgmusic.com/new-files/Robocop_-_Title_Theme.mid  You could use a bit of improvement in terms of accuracy to the original. Use the MIDI I sent as reference. Other than that, good job!  (You should try to improve it. I'm really curious as to how it would sound.)"
chiptunes,3dsk3o,ThePixelMouse,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:28:25 2015 UTC,"Welp. Then all of that hard work was for nothing.  EDIT: I replied before you edited your comment, thanks for the feedback! This is the first time I recreated something completely by ear, I've always had a midi or sheet music to base my arrangements off of in the past. I think the original might've used some more minor chords than I did, but I kinda like how my Famitracker version has a noticeable difference, while still being the same piece. I may go back and update the sheet music/release another version when I get more of it figured out and compared to the midi you linked though!"
chiptunes,3dsk3o,PlaceboWizard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:34:32 2015 UTC,"Alrighty! Just for future reference, www.vgmusic.com is an awesome place to find video game MIDIs. If you can't find it on the main part of the site, you can search through the newly submitted files."
chiptunes,3drqt0,flipperkast,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:42:52 2015 UTC,"I'll try help you out here:   But what do I need to mix and produce chiptune?   The bare minimum is a gameboy and a flash cartridge with a tracker on it (I use LSDJ).   I do have Milkytracker installed on my PC but is it enough?   I have no experience here, sorry   Do I need more?   Just a gameboy I'd say :)   How do people actually connect their DMG's to the mixer?   Using ""pro sound"" mods. This gives the gameboy a clean line-out. Google/youtube it. There are a few different methods.   And lastly, where can I buy the best modded DMG for Chiptune?   Ebay or kitsch-bent. Personally, I'd just buy a gameboy and mod it yourself. It's actually quite easy."
