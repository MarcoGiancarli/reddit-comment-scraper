My old '96 KX250 is still fast than many 450's (it doesn't handle nearly as well a new bike tho), depending on who's riding. In fact in this war the rider is the deciding factor, NOT the bike.  2-strokes are just much harder to ride. I have heard from many new-to-four-stroke racers that they almost feel guilty about how much easier the 4-strokes are to ride."
Motocross,3e60yp,Puzkajuzzi,-1,Wed Jul 22 11:38:30 2015 UTC,I thought 2-strokes were the easier ones to ride because they are much lighter than 4-strokes.
Motocross,3e60yp,ender_wiggum,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:19:11 2015 UTC,"As far as handling goes, the weight and center of gravity is better on the 2-stroke.  The power comes on smoother on a 4-stroke, however, and that makes it easier to manage in many cases.  2-stroke power is so snappy (on/off) that it can be tough to control.    Everything has its place: I race hare scrambles in Florida and the vast majority of riders are on 2-strokes.  If you head over to an MX track, you'll see mostly 4-strokes.  I think the hare scrambles guys find the snappy power is better in super tight woods, where you can use the throttle response.  IMHO, the 2-stroke is more fun.  I just love to hear 'em scream :)"

His crash resulted in him being paralysed from the waist down and ending his professional racing carreer.  I am not sure if he has made any public appereances of him riding. I believe this was his first time. I am sure he felt the power of the crowd going nuts because the last lap he did he was flying!  He has been in some local media following his injury in the past year and has allways shown a positive attitude. He's a good guy and somebody to look up to for sure.

Motocross,3dw24t,iDemonix,11,Mon Jul 20 18:23:40 2015 UTC,"Here is what I would do.   Pressure wash it. Tare it down and inspect everything, especially the bearings. Replace anything that is worn out, missing, broken, etc... (from the picture you could use some new tires, you are missing the lower left subframe bolt, the top left shroud bolt is missing, upper brake line pinch clap bolt is missing, looks like one of the stator cover bolts is missing, and a bolt on the cover next to the cylinder is missing, get new spokes (it looks like the rear wheel is missing one or two but I could be wrong), sprockets and chain seem to be in decent shape, get a vent hose for your gas cap). Put brand new fluids in the bike (brake, coolant, etc...). Then rebuild your forks. Like I said, that's what I would do before getting and aftermarket parts for your bike. If you do all that, definitely get your suspension built for you and your riding level. It's insane the difference it can make."

Before you spend any money on cosmetics you need to make sure the bike is solid. I just bought an 04 yz250 that looked pristine, and I've already had to replace all the pivot bearings, carb lines, fuel line, and a few other small things. I was contemplating getting graphics for it last Friday, went out to the track Saturday and blew my right side crank seal and seized a bearing. Going to need a new bottom end, and I'll do the top end while I'm at it. Dirt bike maintenance can get expensive real quick, and with little warning.  TL;DR Focus on maintenance first, then the fun parts"

Motocross,3duw42,Ih8Hondas,2,Sun Jul 19 21:16:23 2015 UTC,"They are lighter, which is a big reason for switching, though KTM stuck with steel, and they are pretty damn light. While the steel being able to flex is a big change, I think suspension has gotten so good that its not as big of a difference or change as it was 10+ years ago. Plus there are all sorts of rubber mounts and stuff like that being used to compensate. At least thats my understanding of it anyways."
Motocross,3duw42,BrapBattle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:53:00 2015 UTC,Been wondering the same thing. The only thing the aluminum frames have is better technology at this point.
Motocross,3duw42,MrZakk15,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:33:21 2015 UTC,The switch to aluminum is a cost cutting technique for the mfg's. its cheaper to cut aluminum than steel...as far as whats better..i suppose its a preference thing...aluminum frames are rigid but some dont like the vibration..steel is alot more forgiving.  thesee days they are so good its almost a non-question but when they first came out in the late 90s alot of people didnt like them.
Motocross,3duw42,watersign,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:56:07 2015 UTC,"I'm just gunna say this weight wise, I've worked on a farm in the cellars moving cooling pipe. I found a 3 foot section of steel pipe (fairly thin but not like paper. and the hole diameter was probably around 1 foot) and found an aluminum the same thickness and diameter but it was about 20 feet long. Those 2 pipes weighed the same. If not the aluminum weighed less still. That might be more of a reference if you haven't been able to feel the difference between the two metals."

Basically what it is saying is to keep your head just right over the handlebars and keep a neutral position on the bike in the straightaways. Lean back (with your head still over the bars) when going into a corner and when in braking bumps. Accelerating out of corners you want to lean forward so you don't feel like you are about to fall off the back of the bike. What this is doing is keeping close to no strain on your arms so you won't have to grip as hard. Just search up Ryan Villopoto in google images and look how slouched over he is in almost every picture. Hope this helps and sorry if i wasn't that good at explaining it but hey i tried :P. Feel free to add to this if i missed anything.
Motocross,3d7u76,Chazzz12,5,Tue Jul 14 05:46:12 2015 UTC,"1) Water. Drink a hell of a lot of it. Talking getting-up-to-pee-every-half-hour amounts.  2) Seat time. The more your ride, the less it will happen.   3) Loosen up. You don't need to death grip the bars. Learn to hold on with your knees and keep your core tight. Let your hands relax on any jumps/anywhere you can relax them for even a second (but don't relax too much and fall off!).   Mostly just keep riding, but really focus on being hydrated and loosening up your grip. You really don't need to hold tight onto the bars.  I learned that the first time I did a no-hander-lander. The bike goes straight with or without you most of the time. Remember that.   Also, don't try a no-hander-lander unless you have your suspension totally dialed."

Motocross,3d7u76,BrapBattle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:32:52 2015 UTC,that's about it! also try to lean forward standing when you open the gas so you don't have to grip so hard

Motocross,3d0xth,IAmNamedMatt,3,Sun Jul 12 16:33:39 2015 UTC,"Do you have the owner's service manual? It should have come with the bike. It'll tell you the proper procedures. Most of these cylinders don't have thick walls, so you can't rebore them. And they're plated, so you don't want to hone them either.  In general, you pull the cylinder and inspect it. If it's been maintained properly (clean air filter, correct premix, proper warm up) the cylinder will be fine and it's just a new ring and piston ($100-$200 including gaskets). No boring, no plating, no honing. This is how it usually goes when a top end is being done as preventative maintenance and why it's a good idea to do it before it needs it.  If the bike hasn't been cared for, or things have already started breaking necessitating the top end it starts to get ambiguous. If the cylinder's slightly scored, you can smooth out the score marks with sandpaper (per the service manual). If the cylinder is real bad you're either going to have to send it out ($200-$400) or replace the cylinder completely (used, re-manufactured, or new)."
Motocross,3d0xth,I_Engineer,0,Sun Jul 12 17:39:44 2015 UTC,What do you do when the plating wears off.  Because my dad is saying now that you have to replace the entire top when that happens.
Motocross,3d0xth,LieutenantDann,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:16:51 2015 UTC,The plating doesn't wear off. I've been riding for two decades and I have never seen a cylinder wall need replating. Top end replacements are literally as simple as replacing the piston and rings. No honing. No replating. The only thing that would require you to need a new cylinder is if the bike was seized and/or had bad scarring in the walls.
Motocross,3d0xth,MX956,0,Sun Jul 12 18:53:56 2015 UTC,So I am right in saying all you need to do to replace a yz250 top end is around $100-175 and around 30min of my time. Because I keep telling my dad this but he thinks a rebuild takes 400$+ and a shop to do it...
Motocross,3d0xth,MX956,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:57:04 2015 UTC,"It's gonna depend on how the bike was cared for previously. If it was well maintained, you're right. If it wasn't, your dad is right."
Motocross,3d0xth,Katoom72,0,Sun Jul 12 19:26:00 2015 UTC,But for regular annual mantinence it's around $150. Worst case scenario I have to replats it and that is max $250 to do one time right.

Motocross,3d0xth,Katoom72,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:01:47 2015 UTC,"Nikasil re-plating costs about $120. A piston kit with gaskets is about $150. So $300 tops (if the supplier asks a few 10's more for service etc) for a full top-end rebuild. If the cylinder has deep scuffing's that need to be welded then you're looking at +$100.  If the plating is in good condition you only need to know the bore size. Just take it to a shop, have it measured and they give you the correct size of piston (probably the oversized one). If you need a replate you buy the piston first (stock bore size) and bring the piston with the cylinder to have it replated to the correct bore size of the piston.  Top-end rebuild on my 250sx was 270€ with replate and new vortex piston. You only need to look for the correct piston height when you put things back together. This is altered by the base gasket."
Motocross,3d0xth,HoneyBadgerRy,0,Sun Jul 12 19:33:20 2015 UTC,Ok so a regular top end so if everything is good is $150 and worst case scenario I have to replate it ONCE right
Motocross,3d0xth,KICKERMAN360,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:49:32 2015 UTC,"Yup, worst case is welding and a replate of the cylinder that lasts a loooong time. (if you don't seize it) I guess those snowmobiles used multiple cylinder 2stroke engines, then the cost is doubled or tripled."

Motocross,3cy4lv,spottedmarley,5,Sat Jul 11 22:40:24 2015 UTC,"Classic. Timmy Trail rider thinks that moto is easy. If motocross was an easy sport, the top riders wouldn't train 7 days a week to keep their fitness at an insane level. Actual riding (keeping form, riding at 100%, racing, ect) is both mentally and physically exhausting."
Motocross,3cy4lv,Redirected,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:48:28 2015 UTC,i can just imagine what hitting 15 jumps per lap would do to your legs. preloading all that weight every single time
Motocross,3cy4lv,iSeize,4,Mon Jul 13 04:20:54 2015 UTC,"You aren't riding fast and at your limit for extended periods of time without slowing down or making a mistake, that's why you don't get tired."
Motocross,3cy4lv,Tagels,-10,Sat Jul 11 21:52:09 2015 UTC,Not true i always fucking pin it and when i ride im out for at least a gas tank witch is about 2-3 hours and yeah i make mistakes everyone falls once in a while. Thats not good enough for me. I still dont get it.
Motocross,3cy4lv,Tagels,5,Sat Jul 11 22:15:58 2015 UTC,"Well I don't know what to say to you then, all I know is if i go ride on trails and I'm just screwing around having fun, I can be riding ""fast"" but not at 95 or 100%, but its nothing like riding at a track or in a race and putting down 1 fast lap after another at full intensity"

Motocross,3cy4lv,Lone_Star_122,2,Mon Jul 13 04:15:59 2015 UTC,"You're standing and absorbing lots of pressure for an extended period of time in which you can't relax or you eat it. It's high intensity. It honestly feels a lot like a 30 minute insanity workout if you've ever done one of those. Yes you're not lifting huge weights or running 10 miles, but it is constant and intense exertion for a good amount of time."
Motocross,3cy4lv,oneviasx,2,Sat Jul 11 22:26:14 2015 UTC,"The faster you get the harder it is to keep your bike in control and you'll also have to move around more.. I never got arm pump till I started getting faster, tracks play a huge role too, the rougher it is the more work you're gonna have to do.

But try going to Glen Helen and riding 20 minutes. Just messing around at the track will give you a work out. Then try race speed. You might last 5 laps."

Motocross,3csdzn,jarrodalex,6,Fri Jul 10 11:39:15 2015 UTC,I'm assuming you didn't have a shop rag covering the bottom end and something got in there
Motocross,3csdzn,adamcr151515,2,Fri Jul 10 13:04:25 2015 UTC,Did something fall in?  Was the engine covered up when the head was off?  It doesn't take much debris to cause issues.  Sounds like you get to open it up and find out :(

Motocross,3csdzn,ARfandude,2,Fri Jul 10 23:07:31 2015 UTC,Take the head off and spin it. Hard to tell someone's wrenching level but the notchyness could just be from the air pressure in the chamber. Take it back down to where you had it and look at everything. Look at oil for shavings.

Motocross,3csdzn,KICKERMAN360,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:06:58 2015 UTC,"Split the cases and check it out man. Its not worth all the work to have a main bearing fail because of debris. If they are nearly new (for me that means less than 20 hours) then I would try to clean them and see if they are still rough. Also, if you end up pressing either of them out of the case DO NOT reuse them. Bearings are meant to be pressed from the outer race."

Motocross,3coqut,KillYourTV,11,Thu Jul 9 16:07:15 2015 UTC,"Damn...I'm bummed.  I completely understand, but to be honest, I loved watching this dude ride.  I really hope Tomac/Roczen get a chance to battle later this year in Supercross.  As much as I have no reason to dislike Dungey, I just don't get excited watching him win.    Best of luck to RV2!!  Hope he stays in the sport to some extent."
Motocross,3coqut,arbitrary_ambiguity,7,Thu Jul 9 17:51:49 2015 UTC,I don't get excited to see Dungy win either. I like Barcia and Tomac. Barcia was killing it last weekend at Red Bud so hopefully he can carry that over to this weekend.
Motocross,3coqut,Rambles_Off_Topics,3,Thu Jul 9 19:23:09 2015 UTC,"Man, no kidding!  I really wish (and I know this is wrong) that Dungey would miss a race so the points would tighten up, so we could see a close battle between #1, #51, and #5."
Motocross,3coqut,arbitrary_ambiguity,4,Thu Jul 9 19:47:43 2015 UTC,Good for him. I'm glad he didn't get talked into racing another year.
Motocross,3coqut,MrStickers,3,Thu Jul 9 16:16:09 2015 UTC,I think the whole GP thing was him being talked/forced into another year. Pretty sure he was over it last year.
Motocross,3coqut,brobeans471,3,Thu Jul 9 17:04:52 2015 UTC,The way he talked about the MXGPs made me think he actually wanted a change and was excited about it. That schedule is very different than the American races and it seemed to suit his laid back do what I want style. I would have liked to see him finish (and not crash out like that) but I think if anything RV racing over there just made the USA fans much more aware of how bad their tracks are in general. That's my two cents. :)
Motocross,3coqut,MrStickers,2,Thu Jul 9 18:11:30 2015 UTC,"I agree. He definitely wasn't forced into it. I bet he figured if it was his last year you may as well travel the world while doing it, and see some different competition and tracks.  I think his injuries summed it up. He couldn't be at the level he knew he wanted to be at.   He will be missed greatly and was great for the sport!"
Motocross,3coqut,Rambles_Off_Topics,2,Thu Jul 9 19:22:16 2015 UTC,"He had a contract for this year. I think in his perfect world he would have retired at the end of last year. The GPs was the better of the two choices, he said more than once he was tired of the SX/MX grind in the US."
Motocross,3coqut,brobeans471,8,Thu Jul 9 21:42:45 2015 UTC,"Not sure why everyone is so salty over RV retiring, if you have followed him over the last year you knew this day was coming.   Show the man some respect."
Motocross,3coqut,KICKERMAN360,2,Thu Jul 9 19:39:30 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why people care as well. He never got that much fanfare and most disliked him for winning (pretty common for people who dominate). Plenty of other good racers. RV never seemed to be very enthused about racing to me.
Motocross,3coqut,LolaBot22,2,Thu Jul 9 22:09:42 2015 UTC,Agreed.  He was never know to be great among the fans.  Also if you watched any of his bio videos he even stated Supercross was just a career for him and a way to make good money and he lost his passion for it.
Motocross,3coqut,kneedown318,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:35:31 2015 UTC,"He was my favorite rider since Carmichael, and the only other rider that could have come close to what Carmichael had achieved. I remember hearing an interview  with him where he said all he does is ride, for fun, when he's bored, mad, sad, whatever,  he had a lot of love for the sport....but turning your hobby into a career will burn you out for sure.

Motocross,3coqut,AdamR46,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:29:36 2015 UTC,"What I meant was that there aren't enough American racers.  Nicky Hayden got a MotoGP Title in 2006 and just dwindled down from there. Ben Spies got a WSBK Title in 09 and went to MotoGP, got one win and a couple podiums and got hurt so he retired. Colin Edwards never won a MotoGP Race but got a couple podiums in 9 years of racing. No american drivers in Formula 1. Now there aren't any competitive americans in any major international series.  It sucks."
Motocross,3coqut,SpiLLiX,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:43:39 2015 UTC,"thats because mostly we have our own series over here and they pay the same if not better than ""the world stage""   They really don't have any reason to leave."
Motocross,3coqut,cfox109,2,Thu Jul 9 18:07:43 2015 UTC,"Not MotoGP, compared to american road racing. Road racing doesn't get a lot of attention over here compared to supercross and motocross. So we don't have to much talent capable of getting to the world stage."
Motocross,3coqut,AdamR46,-2,Fri Jul 10 00:55:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Supercross pretty much dominates any kind of motocross series."
Motocross,3coqut,brrraaap,4,Thu Jul 9 19:02:16 2015 UTC,"Thing is, he could have won a GP title if he would've went over there before he got so burnt out. The dude has/had the speed, he just lost the drive. That's my opinion anyway"
Motocross,3coqut,AdamR46,-3,Thu Jul 9 17:28:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, that's exactly what he should have done but the American series (sx and outdoor) that we have just take up all his time and before you know it you are either hurt or old."

Motocross,3chimb,EIIIC,3,Wed Jul 8 13:58:59 2015 UTC,"Not at all, if you think about it quads can actually carry more speed in some sections because they don't have to worry about aiming for a small rut/the front end diving down/back end washing out. Imaging a bike through a super slick flat corner versus a quad, would you rather be on two wheels trying to keep yourself upright or on 4 wheels just using throttle control drifting around? I'm not saying they don't have cons that slow them down but they do have the advantage in certain situations."
Motocross,3chimb,brobeans471,8,Wed Jul 8 10:56:10 2015 UTC,"They are two different sports. Look how differently the tracks develop. The quads inherently make smoother, open corners where two wheels create deep chunky ruts. It will never be an apples to apples comparison. Anyone who thinks a pro in either sport isn't incredibly fast is lacking brain cells."
Motocross,3chimb,Rambles_Off_Topics,2,Wed Jul 8 12:55:21 2015 UTC,"I think its still an interesting comparison, even if its not apples to apples, especially considering how close they are in speed despite being such different vehicles."
Motocross,3chimb,Buckyridesfixed,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:53:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought it was interesting how well the quad handled some of the rollers and awkward corner jumps. I expected it to struggle there more. Also, wow the quads really turn the track into a freeway."
Motocross,3chimb,keepingitneil,2,Wed Jul 8 17:00:20 2015 UTC,"I think Quads get a bad rap due to how slow/inexperienced quad riders ruin motocross tracks. We have had many at the local track rolling over every jump and then gunning it at the lip. The lips of the jumps would be ruined twice as fast. The berms also get ruined, as well as make some pretty bad breaking bumps. Also, they are much larger and harder to pass and avoid.  My local track had to ban them after 1 year of opening."

Some people always turn it off as a precaution; I don't generally bother unless I have some reason to think I have a relevant fault, although I'll probably keep doing it for a while out of habit once I fix my carbs :)"
Motocross,3cha8b,rkl22447,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:41:17 2015 UTC,"Been riding for over 25 years, letting it sit with the gas on for a week or two is no big deal but of we are talking like 6 months for winter or something you should drain the gas out of the carb at least if not the tank too. It will gum the carb up and make it difficult to start without taking the carb apart and cleaning it"
Motocross,3cha8b,KICKERMAN360,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:10:53 2015 UTC,"It could sit for ages without a problem but the point is to turn the fuel off in case the float fails and fills the engine up with petrol. And then you go start it and cause engine damage. So it's best to turn it off after use, regardless if the carb is drained/dry or not. I always turn mine off but do forget sometimes."
Motocross,3cha8b,xxMRBrown21xx,0,Tue Jul 7 22:40:15 2015 UTC,Also why I check and smell my oil before I ride.
Motocross,3cha8b,Forthekill,-2,Wed Jul 8 00:15:34 2015 UTC,I prefer to leave the gas on if the carb or pecock don't leak. Keeping the carb wet is less likely to clog up than letting the gas dry up. Or just turn off the gas and drain the carb
Motocross,3cha8b,KICKERMAN360,5,Tue Jul 7 22:23:27 2015 UTC,"That's wrong. If you're gonna let the bike sit, drain the carb or else it 'gums' up the jets."

Motocross,3cavv0,Ktmktmktm,3,Mon Jul 6 16:03:05 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to explain it is at low rpm, the clutch engages. As you rev it, it was slowly disengage for you. Basically, it prevents any type of stall because when you hit very low RPM's, the clutch is automatically engaged for you. Brake taps in the air, locking the rear wheel coming into a corner, being in too high a gear- none of this is a problem anymore. You still need to shift the bike, however shifting is slightly changed. If you let off the gas before you shift, you don't have to use the clutch lever. If you are shifting under power, you still need to use the clutch lever. Any more questions feel free to ask away haha."

I stumbled across Fox as a mountain biker when I bought some Dirtpaws, and those are still my favorite gloves to date especially given the price when they go on sale.  I've got a V2 helmet as well and it is more comfortable than my Shoei road helmet and my old Scorpion MX lid, both of which cost more than twice than the V2.  It blows my mind that people would think Fox sucks.  That said, I loathe their MX in-boot pants.  I've spoiled myself with Klim gear over the years and even the top-tier Fox stuff just feels kind of cheap to me.  Their jerseys never really caught my fancy either."

Jump your bike of the top and you'll be nose high...so tap the brake to bring your nose down and land on the flat top.  The nice thing about this is it will be low speed and you won't have to worry about getting your wheel spinning again, or getting your nose too low.  When you move to tables braking will start to throw you forward, get back on the throttle to stop at the angle you want.  Don't forget to get back on the throttle to get your wheel spinning again before you land, rip away on the throttle to keep your bike straight."

I'm going to make this point as clear as possible, do not even touch your front break going through the air. Ive done it a couple times to save myself from a wreck, but this should not be a habbit. Break tapping your rear wheel is good, it can nose your bike down. Reving your bike in the air can move your nose up because the momentum amd weight of the wheel. You have full control over it. But with your front wheel it can only stop in the air. Once you hit the ground again at 30 mph or so and get that 25 pound wheel in motion can send you over the bars. This is why airplane tires smoke when they touch the ground landing, and also why stunt riders who are pulling wheelies with a stopped front wheel at 60 mph will swap out when it touches back down.   TLDR: Wheel tapping your front brake is a bad idea even on mountain bikes. Only use it as a last second save, but for the most part do not use this. Getting a heavy wheel started in motion again to 30 plus MPH can send you over the bars.  Edit: grabbing your front break can also cause this. http://www.gfycat.com/UnripeUnfinishedDugong  For more on this go to this thread from that GIF: https://www.reddit.com/r/Motocross/comments/2fo6nl/this_guy_grabs_his_front_brake_in_the_air_and_the/"
Motocross,3c7y7p,Theperfectsandwich,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:27:09 2015 UTC,"Not that I disagree with your point but I think the guy didn't fall because the front wheel stopped. Firstly he has massively over jumped it. I doubt he would have saved it even if he tapped the rear brake. And secondly he landed sideways. Yes this was caused by using front brake but it's possible to use it without that.   Otherwise I agree that it should only be used as last option and it's more dangerous than tapping the rear brake. If you're practicing there's no doubt you should practice it right. The thing is that if you're in emergency and don't have rear brake tapping mastered, you can stall your engine, which especially on 4T will cause you to go over the bars."

Beginners/Juniors/Novices are faster on slower bikes because they can control power delivery.  Unless you ride wide-open tracks or they till it very deep when grooming you will be at a disadvantage on a bike you can't hang on to.  If you have the opportunity, compare lap times on a friends 250 (especially after lap 3).  250s feel faster than they actually are.  Newer bikes are great.  A 250f with low hours would probably be the best for your laptimes but nothing wrong with a 125.  Newer YZ or KTM is probably your best bet, especially if you can get a 144/150."

Personally I save filters in zip lock bags and change between motos. That said, four stroke motors are extremely finicky about dust getting through to the valves. Two stroke reeds not so much."
Motocross,3c069z,BentAxel,2,Fri Jul 3 16:18:38 2015 UTC,"i run a stocking on my filter, it doesn't restrict airflow and it keeps the filter clean unless i'm out riding in the sand"
Motocross,3c069z,Boosted801,2,Sat Jul 4 03:04:24 2015 UTC,"I run an oiled twin air dust cover on top of my air filter on my crf450. I have a half dozen of them and change them out after every ride, sometimes a few per day if its really dusty.   Using this sytem, I only change out my air filter when I change oil at 15 or less hours on the crf. I have been doing this for years on this bike and for years on a cr250 before this one.   The dust filters are super easy to change and my air filter is always clean underneath. I have never had seen any particles get past the air filter. If the oiled dust filter is restrictive enough to rob some of the power from my engine, I have never noticed it (maybe a higher level rider would?).   http://www.twinair.com/usa/twin-air-accessories is the filter that I use. I would recommend giving that sytem a try."
Motocross,3c069z,snowboardfreak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:36:24 2015 UTC,For the price it's almost better the buy an extra air filter and swap it between motos
Motocross,3c069z,xCOMUNEx,2,Fri Jul 3 16:18:01 2015 UTC,True... the reason I like the skins is that I don't have to open the intake to the outside in a less-than-ideal environment (e.g. at the track).
Motocross,3c069z,ender_wiggum,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:28:34 2015 UTC,"This is the reason why I'm looking into it as well. I do not like to switch filters at the track with minimal lighting and no good idea whether it actually is fitted properly.  In addition, last time out riding my motor took a bit of sand (luckily I grease up the inside of the filter box and it seems like no damage was done). So I want to be extra safe. I threw away the filter, since the filter was in properly, yet still sand got through (and it seems like it was oiled well).  Thank you for your insights already!"
Motocross,3c069z,nickyz85,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:06:56 2015 UTC,Are you using the filter oil or spray?
Motocross,3c069z,nickyz85,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:39:56 2015 UTC,"Always filter oil. I have never even heard of filter spray. The only thing I'm having some difficulty with is getting all the excess filter oil out (I generally squeeze the filter hard to get the excess out (no wrenching), but there's only so much you can get out)."

Okay, here's what I'm trying to educate you on: Don't repeat everything you hear on TV, the Internet or on Oprah. Think about what you want to write and what you want to communicate and then write what it is that you wish to say.

Also we both aren't adding anything of substance to this conversation or subreddit. So take your own advice sometime about being unique or original. Also don't offer your advice when no one asks for it, and I like how you make assumptions about where I get my ideas.   It is cute how you try to come off as someone who is well educated and talking down to me, I can see the arrogance pouring out of you.

Motocross,3bmwzc,Hollerich,8,Tue Jun 30 14:42:40 2015 UTC,"This is a month old but it appears to dispute most of your claims.   The specialist medical team working with the four time US Supercross champion confirmed the coccyx injury and also discovered an L4 compression in Ryan’s lower spine  Upon discussion with his trainer, Aldon Baker – and considering his desire to compete in and win further MXGP’s in 2015 – the 26 year old has taken the difficult decision to stay in the USA and concentrate on a return to fitness in the shortest possible timeframe.  Steve Guttridge, Racing Manager for Kawasaki Motors Europe, observed that only a fully fit Villopoto would be able to seriously compete and make his presence known in the premier league of World motocross.   Here is a video of his crash.  I think you are correct though, we have seen the last of Ryan Villopoto."
Motocross,3bmwzc,compstomp66,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"I read all of that before. But the industry lies all the time in press releases. Also, a doctor can be shopped for to get the diagnoses he wants. Finally, Aldon Baker would never stray from the party line or divulge any personal information about what Villopoto is really doing or what his current medical condition is. And I've seen the crash several times. I wrote my initial post with all of that in mind, in addition to the comments from the people I have spoken to in Europe.  But, yes, I think we both agree that Villopoto has walked away from the sport."

Motocross,3bmwzc,ambival3nt,-2,Tue Jun 30 19:30:20 2015 UTC,"Well, journalists in U.S. motocross are not really journalists. Steve Giverbson over at VitalMX comes to mind. They are mainly cheerleaders for the industry. People like him are not really journalists  as much as they are corporate propagandists writing carefully worded press releases for companies, riders, manufacturers, etc. And they will never really dig into a story to try to reveal the truth about why someone was fired or why something happened. They ask softball questions most of the time, anyway."
Motocross,3bmwzc,greg_123,7,Wed Jul 1 05:50:14 2015 UTC,"Bullshit alert.  And even if he does quit after this, I highly doubt it's because of your theory. But you'll think it is, and that's all that matters, right?"
Motocross,3bmwzc,Miicr0,-2,Tue Jun 30 17:36:38 2015 UTC,"You are free to disagree with what I wrote, of course. I accept that. I just don't agree with you. I argue that Villopoto wanted out and was willing to do anything it took to get out. And so do a lot of other people both in the U.S. and Europe. This isn't all that controversial if you've been following the 2015 Villopto saga."
Motocross,3bmwzc,HoneyBadgerRy,3,Tue Jun 30 17:50:18 2015 UTC,"It's a fair hypothesis, but just don't treat it as fact is all I'm saying."
Motocross,3bmwzc,Helicoptering,-2,Tue Jun 30 17:51:34 2015 UTC,"I understand your point. I am merely conveying information that I have received from people who are based in Europe and on the inside. A friend told me that there were some people saying the same thin in the U.S., also. So it is kind of a 'badly kept secret' that Villopoto has walked away from things, so to speak."
Motocross,3bmwzc,tdracer665,3,Wed Jul 1 05:41:23 2015 UTC,Listened to the Pulpmx show today. Steve Matthes and Jake Weimer were saying that nobody can reach him. What you said about KRT is true. No communication at all. But Jake Weimer said that his injuries are legit. It's a shame that one of the (if not THE) baddest dudes ever wants to be so far away from anything having to do with the sport. He'll be missed.   I sure wish the Euro experiment had gone better.
Motocross,3bmwzc,tdracer665,3,Tue Jun 30 20:53:34 2015 UTC,I got interested and wondered what the pulpmx show was: http://pulpmxshow.com/sites/pulpmxshow.com/files/podcasts/150629_pulpmxshow_payton_osborne_martin_weimer.mp3  at 3:38:00 they discuss a bit about RV and Kawasaki
Motocross,3bmwzc,tdracer665,2,Wed Jul 1 21:43:46 2015 UTC,I wouldn't understand why he would want out. Any idea on the reason?
Motocross,3bmwzc,tdracer665,3,Tue Jun 30 21:54:58 2015 UTC,Burned out from training for living. He wanted to quit last year
Motocross,3bmwzc,Ajtut,-3,Tue Jun 30 23:25:03 2015 UTC,"Villopoto doesn't like a lot of people in the motocross industry and the business side of things and, as mentioned already by HoneyBadgerRy, he is just burned out from all of the training, riding, racing and traveling. He's ready to close this chapter of his life and move on."
Motocross,3bmwzc,Chuck_Norris79,2,Wed Jul 1 05:45:17 2015 UTC,"It's great that you offer an opinion on the matter, but why is it when someone offers a counter opinion you act like a child? Their opinion or speculation is no more right or wrong than yours so why do that?  It will be a shame if he disappears, being such an icon for the sport he could do so much to help build it more, even if he wasn't on a bike. He will be missed, and hopefully we get some word from people who know and not your ""he said, she said"""
Motocross,3bmwzc,RyanTally,-2,Thu Jul 2 00:49:15 2015 UTC,"First, what do you mean, specifically, by saying that I, ""act like a child""? Second, you are making an ad hominem personal attack against me by calling me a child, which would make you the immature one here. You should focus on the content of my information, not me. I understand that you do not want to accept that Villopto has walked away from motocross. That is fine, but you need to focus on the message, not the messenger.  Finally, I know more than you do. I am not basing my information entirely on opinion, like you seem to think."
Motocross,3bmwzc,Helicoptering,2,Thu Jul 2 04:12:51 2015 UTC,"OK first I have seen your content, and when someone brings up something counter to your ""knowledge"" you tell them they are wrong, and respond very childishly. 2nd my personal attack was an observation based on your responses, so that still makes you a child in my eyes, and you haven't really proven me otherwise. 3rd I couldn't care less if he walks away or not, he's a grown man who can do what he wants with his life. I would like to see the sport to continue to grow and he would be one of the many faces that could help. 4th hard to focus on your ad hominem when you say he's over playing his injuries, when there was a post that says otherwise. I have focused on the message, but it's hard when the messenger is a poor sport about anything that isn't his word.  Finally, I'm glad you know more than I do. I never claimed to know anything from what I've read about it. Just like you though, your forming and stating your opinions and you expect us to take them as fact. There's another reason that you come off like you do, you put the other posters down because of their opinions, and no matter what yours is the only one that counts."
Motocross,3bmwzc,RyanTally,-3,Thu Jul 2 05:00:42 2015 UTC,"Now you are the one being a child. As the saying goes, ""Pot. Meet kettle."""
Motocross,3bmwzc,BrapBattle,2,Thu Jul 2 05:05:06 2015 UTC,"How am I being a child? Oh that's right you're just going to ignore the points and insult me. I know I called you a child but at least I backed up with some substance. Also my whole post wasn't about just saying one quip. I knew I should have let this lost die, I took the troll bait hook, line, and sinker. Well played, I shall leave you to your shit posting now."
Motocross,3bmwzc,RyanTally,-3,Thu Jul 2 05:11:14 2015 UTC,Now you're really behaving like a jack ass.

Motocross,3bhf9d,oneviasx,10,Mon Jun 29 06:25:10 2015 UTC,"favorite: Dungey, smooth and consistent.  Similar: Ronnie Mac"
Motocross,3bhf9d,woodsweapon,6,Mon Jun 29 14:12:11 2015 UTC,"K dub was always a favorite of mine because of his style. Even when he wasnt the fastest guy on the track he just always seemed to have flow and just textbook style. Tomac is another guy who is similiar though had hot and cold days.   Also gotta give it up to Josh Grant, cause he can throw some fatty whips."
Motocross,3bhf9d,BrapBattle,3,Mon Jun 29 07:08:54 2015 UTC,"+1 for K dub, favorite rider growing up, first number to go on my bike was 14."
Motocross,3bhf9d,Hollerich,-4,Mon Jun 29 10:20:09 2015 UTC,"By ""K dub"", I assume that you mean Kevin Windham, but that you are not intelligent enough to spell his name correctly. At any rate, and regardless of his 'style', he never won shit.  As mentioned previously, 'style' is for circle jerks and glam boys. It has no relevance to those who want to, and do, win."
Motocross,3bhf9d,BrapBattle,5,Thu Jul 2 16:48:28 2015 UTC,"Damn whats up your butt? I can spell Windham, and if I had issues I could have glanced at the poster on my wall, or you know, checked on google. Anyone who has followed the sport up until the past few years will know that K dub is his nickname. Regardless, the whole point of this entire thread is to discuss riding styles, not who is the fastest and has the most wins, so maybe you are the one who lacks intelligence.   All that aside, regardless of how often he won Windham was consistently fast, consistently smooth, and always a fan favorite. He always had good teams supporting him, and even when things went south with Yamaha Honda scooped him up immediately. The dude raced years longer than most and had fun doing it while making bank. I would chalk his life off as a big fat win any day of the week."
Motocross,3bhf9d,Hollerich,-2,Thu Jul 2 18:31:15 2015 UTC,"Now, as far as Kevin Windham being a success, there are two ways of looking at this, as you may already know. First, yes, he has been a financial success. Does that matter to a professional motocrosser? What young motocross racers care about is becoming champions.  Windham is not a champion. He has money, but he was never a champion."
Motocross,3bhf9d,Hollerich,-5,Thu Jul 2 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"Okay, much better. However, I would like to see a comma between Yamaha and Honda in the third last sentence of your final paragraph.

Motocross,3bhf9d,BrapBattle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:35:33 2015 UTC,"I honestly cant tell if you are trolling or just a no life at this point. First the whole Villopoto gossip/drama you were trying to start, now saying only champions are considered successful in the sport, plus acting like your shit doesn't stink and you are above others for having a difference of opinion.   I feel like the only thing you do on this sub is try to start drama just so you can argue with strangers."
Motocross,3bhf9d,jconley691,6,Thu Jul 2 19:37:33 2015 UTC,"Justin Bogle has some of the best style out there right now (when he's not injured) in my opinion. Just so loose and fluid, yet still going as fast as ever.  As far as similarity goes, I try to emulate the frenchman Pourcel, especially with line selection and not pushing too hard. Dude looks like he isn't trying at all. I doubt I look the same though lmao."
Motocross,3bhf9d,Ih8Hondas,2,Mon Jun 29 17:08:55 2015 UTC,"Bogle's got a unique  style for sure, I honestly think he's the only one that can pull off the whole 'leg swag' thing."
Motocross,3bhf9d,Ih8Hondas,3,Tue Jun 30 14:22:12 2015 UTC,"I love watching Pourcel ride. And K-Dub before him.  My style is probably closer to Pastrana and Kyle Partridge though, just because it's impossible to look smooth on a motocross bike when you're 6'5""."
Motocross,3bhf9d,ghostmiker,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:20:57 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding me? I envy you tall riders, there's nothing cooler then looking effortless while going fast. I think most of the illusion comes from your torso looking so laxed because your arms are long enough to do most of the motions without moving your whole upper body all over the place, all while the bike is going crazy underneath you. You should definitely embrace your height, you tall guys make bikes look like your bitch."

Motocross,3bhf9d,Hollerich,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:24:26 2015 UTC,"Having your elbows up isnt just a matter of style, its having leverage and control of the bike under you. Its this fancy thing professionals and people who know anything about anything refer to as technique. I completely understand what you are trying to say here -Style =/= speed- but not a single person in this post brought that up yet you are replying to people arguing  that and trying to insult them for no reason. I could understand bringing that side of the argument up, but its awfully pathetic that you feel the need to try to put down others and call them stupid for answering the question OP asked and generating regular discussion. Keep replying though, you are doing an excellent job showing everyone what an immature idiot you are."

Sore is relative though, and replacing fluid and electrolytes will generally help most. Replacing lost calories is important too.   It's good that you're prepping the day before. One thing I always tell people about hydration is that you can't turn a raisin back into a grape by just pouring a glass of water over it. It has to soak. Your body is the same way. If you can, start hyper hydrating 2 days in advance. Lots of salt, and lots of water. Dont forget the salt!   You can overdo it, but it's hard. Most people live their lives way less hydrated than they should."

Motocross,3amw26,Yamaha224,3,Sun Jul 5 16:39:00 2015 UTC,"I don't see where this is located but in utah, $1600 is the average price for a 2003-2005 Yz 250 in great condition. I would look for a newer bike at that budget. 2006 or newer gets you both the aluminum frame and the speed sensitive suspension- basically the same as a brand new yz250"
Motocross,3amw26,infrequentaccismus,4,Mon Jun 22 00:53:54 2015 UTC,A 2005+ in my entire state that is in good condition is 3000 at the lowest. A pre-2005 in great condition is around 2500.
Motocross,3amw26,Rambles_Off_Topics,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:07:39 2015 UTC,Same here! I live in Northern Indiana. 2 Strokes and 4 strokes are going for outrageous prices now. I bought a 2005 RMZ450 for $2000 and that is very cheap for the region.
Motocross,3amw26,Rambles_Off_Topics,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:38:49 2015 UTC,I still dont understand though how 450 are so cheap though. Almost always the same price/cheaper than a 250f and I dont know why. Must be the used risk of a four stroke!
Motocross,3amw26,Meebert,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:25:25 2015 UTC,I notice 450's are usually $500 more. Maybe people are too scared of the size? I'm not sure. I love it though! It's my first 4 stroke so hopefully there aren't any huge issues (bottom end) any time soon!
Motocross,3amw26,BrapBattle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:38:45 2015 UTC,I would love a 450 but as a pretty light 16 year old I feel like it wouldnt be the right choice :/  I mean i guess a 2 stroke 250 is comparable but i dont think my dad understands the power difference of a 2 vs 4 stroke!

Also based on the pictures, and description of the bike (like saying its stock except bars and grips) leads me to believe it wasnt owned by someone who had the best of knowledge about keeping up with maintenance etc. He never mentioned the Wheels, which look aftermarket, and the single random Hot Rods sticker on the rear fender means he probably had to replace something in the motor and slapped on the sticker that came in the package. Then again, he could have found the sticker laying around from other bikes or friends, who knows. Just my two cents based on what I see in the ad."

Motocross,3amw26,illvillemx,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:11:40 2015 UTC,I would get a 125 but I know a lot of people have gone from a ttr230 to a yz250 and have been fine if they take it slow. The reason behind it is one cost because I dont want to be wanting more later but another reason is the trails i ride. I know a lot of people said for the trails I ride (mostly orv routes) that i would be riding a yz125 on pipe all the time and especially considering I ride pretty far usually i dont wanna be burning gas like hell. Because some weekends I will ride 100+ miles in a day. Plus i want a bike that has low end torque which a 125 doesnt have much of!c

Broke my arm and got really hurt. A year later, decided to enter the 250 class on a ktm 250sx and broke my collarbone. No big deal, but now, I'm a recovering heroin addict and I can NOT take narcotic painkillers, like at all, or I'll go back to shooting dope for sure, I just know it. What do I do if I get hurt?

Motocross,3anntj,honda27,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:58:36 2015 UTC,"I ride an 07 crf250 (suspension and basic engine mods, nothing crazy just some porting and carb tuning) and can beat most people on modern 450s. A pro friend of mine jumps on my bike and turns lap times comparable to his brand new badass KTM250 - he even says my bike is the most fun to ride right off the bat.    Save up a grand and get your suspension done (I like Factory Connection but everyone has their preference), and maybe do the top end on your bike just to make sure it'll last awhile. Other than that just get out and practice until you can string together 6 laps at a comfortable race speed without making mistakes. In my experience most people don't really lose much of their speed, they just lose their edge and their endurance. Once you can do that pace yourself on other people and ask them what class they run, then enter that class. Now that you're older and wiser you'll be less susceptible to that desire to push yourself. You'll figure out the limit pretty quickly, my advice on that is if you want to push yourself do it in slow corners. If you can make up half a second in a slow corner (which most non-pro people can do), it will be way more beneficial to your lap time than jumping a crazy triple or scrubbing some gnarly jump."

Motocross,3agvhz,Meebert,2,Sat Jun 20 02:53:40 2015 UTC,"We certainly hope so! The manufacturer has them at very similar curve power levels in the EU but we are in the process of getting official dyno results posted from testing here in the states for the four models.

With regards to after market parts the XR50 shares a lot in common with KTMs 50sx, we are negotiation with WP to introduce their components. In terms of stock parts support we are very well covered with our OEM manufacturers.   A little more information about what is offered standard on them are Arrow silencer, Marzocchi front forks with 2016 to have upside down as a standard option. The rear monoshock assembly is from Paioli. FaBa wheels and they come with Pirelli Scorpions for the tires."

Motocross,3agvhz,Ih8Hondas,8,Sat Jun 20 03:40:06 2015 UTC,Give us a 125 version in a full size frame.
Motocross,3agvhz,fragm,3,Sat Jun 20 12:14:10 2015 UTC,"I will try to answer some questions and give a background about these bikes.   The CSM is Collard Sport Motorcycles Moto Factory s.r.o. setup by my brother's son in Slovakia. Motorcycles and motocross in particular being a family tradition going back t o the socialist Czechoslovakia era where we built a frankenstein Jawa to race around in the 60s and 70s. Forward to 2000's, my nephew built and modified small engine vehicles including mopeds and scooters for a long time and started building his own bikes.   We were going to start importing his first designs and prototypes in 2005 but it just didn't come together until about 2012-2013. However, due to new federal laws to control high amounts of low quality 50cc motor vehicles being mass imported to the United States with little manufacturer accountability, we had to make sure to register, file, test and properly build these bikes and now we're ready to get them out to dealers.   The motorcycles themselves are primarily for the competition purposes and so Meebert, thank you for mentioning Cobra and KTM because that's exactly our segment that we are getting into with the XR50. The engine is a Polini engine, which was chosen due to reliability, that like I mentioned comes in 10.5, 5.8 and 5.5 horsepower configurations in both Senior and Junior sizes.  Currently we are working on approval so that they can be raced in AMA sanctioned events additionally we are planning at expanding the sizes and models in the future. Our primary goal was to offer a real alternative for kids (at the moment) who want a true competition motorcycle.   Here in the United States we are in Southern California so you'll usually see us around the tracks and my son and I are riding the trails or desert or doing rides like LA Barstow Vegas. I think I wrote a lot and apologize but thank you very much for your feedback!"
Motocross,3agvhz,amerikn,2,Sat Jun 20 19:23:02 2015 UTC,Good luck! I think you need to work on the branding and have a better name if you want to compete.
Motocross,3agvhz,The_funny_guy,2,Sat Jun 20 20:43:31 2015 UTC,"I didn't even know Polini was still around. Last time I saw a Polini was the early 2000s. Used to see them all over the place in the 50cc classes, and IIRC they made a 65 right before they fell off the radar."
Motocross,3agvhz,The_funny_guy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:02:45 2015 UTC,These look absolutely stunning.   With the 'xr' and red colour I thought these were Honda at first which puzzled me when I saw they were 2 stroke.  Then it dawned on me...  Csm.  Great to see competition on the mini bike sector.
Motocross,3agvhz,HoneyBadgerRy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:28:46 2015 UTC,Thank you! We certainly hope the market welcomes us. They have been performing very well in European competitions. However we understand that things have to translate well when first coming over to the US market.
Motocross,3agvhz,Dumbosgreatestfan,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:24:37 2015 UTC,Are you guys really naming it xr50? Honda already made one of those. Won't it get confusing for customers?
Motocross,3agvhz,HoneyBadgerRy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:10:04 2015 UTC,It was a decision from the manufacturer in Slovakia and we have to work with it. And it will definitely be a hurdle but we believe people will see the difference when they ride it. However you are correct it is a problem but it was approved on import and it is what we are working with now.
Motocross,3aipc9,seyolol,3,Sat Jun 20 15:57:50 2015 UTC,Any of the name brands are good I've always ridden and preferred Yamaha I've had good luck with them. If I were you I would get a 250 that's what I started out on.
Motocross,3aipc9,iamnsflife,5,Sat Jun 20 16:31:58 2015 UTC,"It depends. Are we talking a lot of flatland, with few hillclimbs and not too treacherous terrain? Or are we talking narrow trails, lots of hills and rocks and whatnot. If the former, 250 2stroke all day. If the latter, you are probably going to want at least a 250 4 stroke. Now, you can do all that shit on a 250 but it does take quite a bit of technique and finesse with your clutch and just time on the bike, whereas a 4 stroke will be much more forgiving, probably providing an overall more enjoyable time for you. I see so many guys start off on a really racey bike (like a 250 2 stroke) and they dont ride it where the bike excels, and they dont have the skill to be able to make the bike do it and they end up having a terrible time. This is just my .02cents.   Also, the big names are Honda, Yamaha, KTM, Suzuki, and probably in Europe you will see a lot of Husqvarna as well.  Some food for thought, If you see a bike like a Honda CRF450R, The ""f"" in this instance indicates 4 stroke. the ""r"" indicates race model. You will probably want the other model which would be CRF450X. Its the enduro model, while it runs a lot of the same stuff, the motor is a bit more reliable, and needs less valve adjusting.  Welcome to the family.  P.S. (from the sounds of it. a 4stroker will probably serve you best.) Dont be afraid to PM me if you have any other questions."
Motocross,3aipc9,DethronedDeity,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:52:31 2015 UTC,thank you for the really elaborate reply. yeah the terrain will be more or less the latter you described. so itll probably be a 250 4 stroke.  thanks as well for the explanation of the names. it makes much more sense now.
Motocross,3aipc9,Ktmktmktm,3,Sun Jun 21 07:44:19 2015 UTC,Yeah a 125 or 250 2 stroke would be best IMO. You can also look into KTM 200's and 300's. The 125 might be a little lacking in power depending on how good you can ride it. I recommend 2 strokes mainly because they are MUCH cheaper to maintain.
Motocross,3aipc9,msoetaert,3,Sat Jun 20 17:02:01 2015 UTC,"Any of the Big 4, well, I guess 5 now, will be great. I would go with a fuel injected 250, because fuel injection usually does better in the mountains. Something like a Yamaha Wrx 250 would be perfect."
Motocross,3aipc9,Old_King_Doran,3,Sat Jun 20 19:03:05 2015 UTC,250 4 stroke is good if you have the money
Motocross,3aipc9,kneedown318,2,Sat Jun 20 19:11:00 2015 UTC,"2 stroke 250 or 300, very versatile, if it doesn't ride the way you want you can mod it into what you'd like."
Motocross,3aipc9,behohippy,2,Sat Jun 20 18:06:48 2015 UTC,"Lot of good advice in this thread. I'd add: Avoid a 250 2 stroke or a 450 4 stroke.  Both are incredibly good bikes but can beat you up more while riding and tend to not do well in tight technical trails, until you have a lot of experience.  Some people say that the bike you learn the most on is a 125 2-stroke.  I've never personally ridden one but it sounds valid."
Motocross,3aipc9,philksigma82,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:28:15 2015 UTC,Whatever you get make sure it's a 2 stroke.  If you end up not riding too much in a years time at least you're not dumping another $1500 in for a new top end.  If you do learn to ride it well on any terrain you're going  to be better than if you'd learned on a 4 stroke because of the great deal of finesse and technique it takes to ride a smoker. Oh and Yamaha or KTM all the way!
Motocross,3aipc9,philksigma82,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:08:42 2015 UTC,"How do you get to the $1500 figure? I bought gaskets, circlips, wrist pin, piston and rings for $140 for a YZ250F."
Motocross,3aipc9,Katoom72,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:29:54 2015 UTC,I'm not making any assumptions but this guy probably doesn't know how to rebuild an engine at this point so I'm just going off of the price that it cost to take my 4 stroke in for top ends back when I raced.  A 2 stroke is WAY easier to rebuild with simple know how in your own garage.
Motocross,3aipc9,Jackol1,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:41:13 2015 UTC,"That's if the cylinder wall is still in spec and no headwork has to be done. Else you'll go past that $140, if you can't do the work yourself you're gonna have to pay labor as well."
Motocross,3afm7r,TravosaurusRex7,9,Fri Jun 19 19:07:48 2015 UTC,"My parents were quite the opposite. If they came to my races, they would sit at the pit and wait for me to come back. But my dad was always out of town for business and my mom only came and sat at the pit and talked on the phone. One year I went to LL, only my mom came and I just got obliterated in a crash, (read: Coma, messed up organs) And after that day, my dad tried more often to come see me race and my mom stopped talking on the phone. It took me to barely escape death for my parents to care about my racing. I wish they cared more before shit got bad.   I want to spread some words of wisdom to you kids on the internet these days, (I'm almost 22, and you 10 year olds have iPhones and ""swag"") Do not take your parents for granted. I don't know how your parents talk to you before and after you race, if they talk or yell or don't talk to you much.... But cherish everything they do. These bikes are expensive, and your life is priceless. The fact that they buy your bikes for you (if they do) and support you out there racing, be mindful that they love you and want the best for you. It takes them so much to not let go of you before that gate drops. If your parents yell at you, just take it and just go and do your best. Life is short, get out and enjoy the racing, enjoy the exhaust-filled air, and most of all, be kind to your parents.   I almost died at Loretta's, so don't forget to tell your family you love them and how much you appreciate them.   Now get off your computer and go ride, it's nice out there."

Motocross,3a66d2,Rambles_Off_Topics,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:00:40 2015 UTC,"I would negotiate the best you can. Also, if it is your very first bike, I would highly suggest buying used. Then you can get your ""feet wet"" see if the sport is right for you. Also buying used you save a ton of money. When you roll that brand new klx off the show room floor you can almost cut the price in half. Also, with a used bike you won't be scared to crash. Also, why a klx?

I was originally leaning towards a honda, but the kawasaki just felt better. And yes to trail riding, rather than track.   I've looked into used bikes here, but my area doesn't seem to have the best deals when it comes to used dirt bikes, so I figured I'd start off on a bike where I would know everything it's gone through from the beginning rather than relying on the word of someone trying to get rid of their bike."

For trail riding around the house and pits that is a good bike. Kawasaki and Suzuki make great bikes! I doubt you will have to do anything other then regular maintenance, that is only if you do regular maintenance! ;)   I would consider though in this size range no matter what used bike you get it will still be a better deal then brand new. No matter what repairs or maintenance will need to be done"
Motocross,3a66d2,Rambles_Off_Topics,3,Thu Jun 18 02:31:29 2015 UTC,"I think in this size range, if you're able to find a decent price on one, I'd do it. It's more than likely ridden by a younger kid, used as a step between the 50's and 250's, so it could be in great shape. Especially with learning, and on something she probably WILL crash on... just get a decent used bike."
Motocross,3a66d2,woodchain,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:14:53 2015 UTC,I agree completely. Buying brand new in this size range is pretty silly to me. Especially financing one! Remember if you buy a brand new one you are still going to have to change the fluids / oil after the break in period. You may as well buy used and change the fluids / oil anyway!
Motocross,3a7ij6,behohippy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:59:27 2015 UTC,At this point I'd just get a set of stainless valves installed and pick up a new piston. Should be less than a grand if you do the assembly yourself.
Motocross,3a7ij6,XR250rdr,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:21:37 2015 UTC,I thought about this but I chatted with a guy who used to race them and said a stainless kit ate his top end.  Basically the whole valvetrain is designed for the lighter components and adding heavier springs/guides/valves caused his bike grief over the long run.  He suggested just going with the titanium OEM valves and sucking up the change every 2 seasons.
Motocross,3a7ij6,Tagels,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:34:47 2015 UTC,"Updating this thread:  Went the cheap route.  Replacing the 2 intake valves with OEM replacements.  Minimal shop time and it will supposedly last another 2 seasons (1 if I race... which I don't.) I'm trusting the mechanic on this one because he's raced this exact bike for 6 years.  Might get a new piston while he's in there, they don't last forever either."
Motocross,3a5n4e,brrraaap,3,Wed Jun 17 12:33:23 2015 UTC,"The Speed sensitive suspension is probably the reason Yamaha 2 strokes were recommended over KTMs despite the KTMs having a horsepower advantage up until recently (KTM is catching up with continued development), it's pretty good stuff for its time, but before I suggest you buy a complete set of forks you should consider the options you have. Will your old forks sell for enough to be worth the upgrade? How much would the fork swap cost compared to getting your suspension re-valved and re-sprung?"
Motocross,3a5n4e,Meebert,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:48:36 2015 UTC,"I haven't dug into it too far, but it looks like it would cost around $300 more to buy the SSS fork and sell my stockers than to revalve. That's mostly what I'm curious about, whether or not it's worth the money. For that $300 I could rebuild & revalve the rear shock, so if the SSS forks aren't leaps and bounds ahead of the older KYB stuff I'll just revalve."

Motocross,3a1hm1,soproductive,3,Tue Jun 16 15:24:44 2015 UTC,"Go ahead and start if you want to race! If I were you though, I would make sure you're familiar with the track before racing on it, might help prevent a spill when you're well acquainted with the jumps, turns, and soil. Adrenaline gets pumping when you race and it's easy to get carried away - remember to breathe!   I've grown up riding, have a good dozen years or so, and the number one thing to remember is to never ride over your head, just have fun and don't push yourself if you aren't comfortable doing something. That's usually how people get hurt.   Lastly, invest in a leatt neck brace, it can save your life and is just as important as a helmet imo. I've watched a kid break his neck (killed him instantly) before in a crash and it's horrible, don't chince out on your safety gear in this sport.   My dad always put it this way: ""you only buy a hundred dollar helmet if you have a hundred dollar head.""  That applies to all riding gear.   Edit: I have to add, a $50 pair of knee/shin guards do wonders in case of a fall also. Not very comfortable when you get hot and sweaty, but I was always so happy I had mine whenever I fell. It's always nice to be able to jump right back up and not have fucked up knees."
Motocross,3a1hm1,CaptainGnar,2,Tue Jun 16 17:20:13 2015 UTC,"Can confirm buy knee guards. Just got off crutches and bought some lol (nothing broken thankfully)  If you have a cycle gear near you check their sales, I just bought a Leatt  trail neck brace for $175 (originally priced at $300) and the BILT dominator knee guards for $10. Not sure if the sale is still going but it's worth a look."

Important things to remember and wear all your gear and don't push yourself. I also have a YZ250 now but started on a track with a CR125, and I'm kinda glad I started with the 125 because you can get yourself in trouble quickly with a 250. It might be a good idea to try and find/make some smaller jumps to get comfortable with the suspension in the air before going to a track with deep ruts, bumps, and other bikes. There is a practice track near my house that has 1 small jump and a bunch of really rutted turns and huge bumps, and going there a few times a week to practice has helped a ton also."
Motocross,3a1hm1,modelboy211,3,Tue Jun 16 18:17:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly bro I'd race the 125, it's lighter and has some wicked power on outdoor tracks, I've ridden both a 125 two stroke and 250 two stroke and noticed that although the 250 two stroke does have some impressive power ,  the 125 was way more agile and nimble thru corners and I felt like the powerband was so.  Much more smoother and linear,  and I've ridden both a cr125 and a yz250 and have 5 years of racing and I'd have to say you can be just as competitive even more I'f you get  comfortable on the cr as you can the yz,  overall more power doesn't always equal better placing,  I've seen kids on 125s rip guys on 450s to shreds,  so don't be afraid to mix It up  wit guys on bigger bikes,  just remember at your level the only thing making a difference in your level is performance during the race and your overall skill and comfortability on the track and your bike"
Motocross,3a1hm1,Mitchmitchhh,2,Wed Jun 17 06:02:59 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I realised that right after I got on the 250, my 125 was old and I spent twice as much time working on it as I did riding it, and it was really underpowered even for a 125. The 250 was practically new and I got a great deal on it, so I picked it up. I would have been better off getting a brand new 125 for racing but now that my fitness is a lot better I'm much more comfortable on the 250, and it is a super fun bike, so I don't regret buying it."
Motocross,3a1hm1,Fultonium95,2,Wed Jun 17 12:41:21 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat, running a '99 kx125 and having completely redone the engine (gearbox bearings, crank bearings, conrod and replating the cylinder etc) I see it needs a complete redo of suspension and forks :/ so yeah the older bikes are probably best to start on but better to move to something newer before you get too fast and end up killing yourself because the bike ain't up to the job."
Motocross,3a1hm1,ender_wiggum,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:23:07 2015 UTC,"Never too late to start.  I'd practice on a real track several times before I raced.   If you play soccer regularly you'll be fine for MX.  Being fit is one of the main components of winning. Wear all the pads (FOX knee and elbow are great). Don't ride above your ability: fear is your body telling you to slow down.  Listen to it. If you are hyper-competitive, remember: this is just for fun. Maintain your brakes and cables.  A stuck throttle on the face of a jump is a bad time.   Also, look into Hare Scrambles or Enduro.  A fun alternative to MX."

Motocross,3a4ato,Redirected,3,Wed Jun 17 03:01:46 2015 UTC,"A revalve means they adjust the way it works (the way oil passed around basically) and sometimes a different spring is used. For most people (aka someone of average weight and skill), the stock forks can be pretty good if you read the service manual and put the right amount of oil in when you rebuild it. Gonna be honest, if you don't know the difference, you probably don't need your suspension revalved (probably rebuilt though)."
Motocross,3a4ato,KICKERMAN360,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:41:49 2015 UTC,"Stock forks these days on suzukis and ktms are so shit for some reason and imo impossible to ride mx track without full rebuild and revalve even then Suzukis fork is sketchy. Suzuki and KTM I have never understood how they got worse over the years, but they have. Not sure about Honda but I know Yamaha and kawi stock are decent and race able without rebuild or revalve, actually Yamahas forks are like riding on clouds."
Motocross,3a4ato,Youwishh,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:44:10 2015 UTC,Rebuilding is simply replacing the all the seals and bushings inside the fork or shock. A revalve would include changing the valving assembly to better suit your weight/riding ability. Unless the forks or shock aren't functioning properly you won't have any improvement from a rebuild. A revalve however would make the suspension better suited to your riding ability and weight. Usually a revalve would include a rebuild (replacement of all wear parts) since it would be completely disassembled anyway.

But the way the guy cranks that opposite flair around (1st trick in the video) just does not make any sense whatsoever. It shouldn't work."
Motocross,39yu5l,Lone_Star_122,3,Mon Jun 15 23:20:46 2015 UTC,I quit watching FMX for a while. After Travis left and a couple of guys died it just wasn't there for me and there wasn't really much progression. But holy crap there has been a jump in progression lately. I'm going to have to start following free style again.
Motocross,39yu5l,KICKERMAN360,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:18:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the era around Lusk's death was pretty awful. Seemed like one or two guys a year were going out at comps.   Nowadays, people seem to be riding on better courses or something; rare to see a huge crash at an X fighters, for example. And the riding has definitely gone through the roof. A lot of guys have started throwing body varials. There are at least four in rotation right now (no pun intended) and few guys are doing the same ones. Clinton Moore does a variation of Kyle Loza's Electric Doom that's basically a dead-body/barhop to backflip back onto the seat, and Pages' special flip is great too."
Motocross,39yu5l,jconley691,2,Tue Jun 16 16:41:55 2015 UTC,"Good run. He mostly has a ""no flips"" policy which is pretty awesome. Although Travis Pastranas 2006 x games run was my vote for the best. At the time it was pretty flawless and did so many tricks. The funniest thing? He pretty much did the same run in 2009 (I think) with the addition of a double flip and still smashed the competition."
Motocross,39yu5l,woodchain,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:51:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, that one in 09 was awesome, too. I'm a sucker for creative use of course, and I remember him doing a massive wallride. When somebody can throw a bunch of tech, innovative tricks and also do some one-off creative course stuff, it gets my adrenaline going for whatever reason.  Pages' alley-oop flair is so awesome; the way he spots the landing last second and sort of plants the front end is just badass. I want to see a big, floaty alley-oop 180 from him, too. Those are one of my favorite tricks to do on a snowboard and I can't even imagine how cool it would feel on a bike.   And his flair from the dirt hit+the big transfer just made it for me. I'm half-expecting to see to see an edit with him throwing flair out in Ocotillo or something. Everything is 10x cooler done dirt-to-dirt IMHO.  Sheeny's run was awesome, too, just in a more conventional sense, and I still can't believe Moore's throwing the Bundy every run these days. That trick looks like death.   As for Pages, I would like to see one flip trick from him per run just to prove he's got the monkey off his back, and I wish he'd throw a holy grab or two instead of double-grabs for his retro trick.   edit: and oh yeah, wtf's up with the bike flip? I know he shaved like 30 lbs. off that 250, but it still looks impossible to me."

Motocross,39zldp,bushhy,2,Tue Jun 16 01:52:22 2015 UTC,"I have a 04 YZ250 and it has a ridiculously touchy throttle. It goes from throttle off to doing a wheelie with the smallest twist you can do. It's my second 250 2 stroke, 9th motorcycle total, and it's nothing like my RM250 or any other bike I've had. Only thing on it is a FMF pipe and jet change for it so I can't figure out why it's so touchy. I used to think like you that a bike is only as fast as you twist the throttle, but with a dirt bike since you're always hitting bumps throttle control can be difficult at times especially for a beginner. If I was basing my opinion on my experience with my RM250 I'd say it's ok for a heavier rider to start on. It felt similar to a 125 with more torque to me but maybe it was needing a rebuild or something. After owning the Yz250 though I can't recommend it to anyone that's a beginner. I'm even thinking about selling it for a WR450 or similar bike because the YZ is just too much for trail riding which is what I mainly do now. It is really fun though..."

Motocross,39zldp,overanedge,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:49:37 2015 UTC,"1) Just about anything if the suspension is sprung for your weight.  2) Hard to say, a YZ250 is not a slow bike, and it definitely doesn't fall under the category of a beginners bike.  3) $2500 is probably in the middle of in terms of market value. Though I'm sure you might be able to find one for cheaper.  I'm 6'4"" 235lbs and from the time I was on 80cc's to now I've been too heavy for everything I ever swung a leg over. Whatever bike you decide to ride do yourself a favor and re-spring the bike for your weight, it will cost somewhere near $230 in parts but it will make your bike handle the way it was meant to and be much more fun to ride. www.racetech.com is a good place to start but any suspension company can help you.  A 250 two-stroke may scare the shit out of you at first but maybe it won't. Hard to say. As others have mentioned a 250f might be a better fit, but you may get bored of it after awhile.  Something not mentioned here in this thread which might be a recommendation is a Honda XR400, especially if you're doing more trail-riding than track-riding. It's large enough in size where you won't feel like you're riding a pit-bike and have enough power to scoot you around with out getting you into too much trouble. Good luck."

Motocross,39zldp,nemisis714,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"Just remember that you're the one who controls the throttle. A bike is only as fast as how much you twist. A 250 will be perfect, as long as you take the time to familiarize yourself with what the bike likes to do before you start going crazy.   That being said, the first real bike I had was a CRF450R. I actually prefer the four-strokes because they're a bit more predictable. I think the torque is easier to deal with than the 'snappyness' of a two-stroke.  We have an older KDX220 that would make for an awesome beginner bike and I still ride it when my big bike is down."

Motocross,39xg3i,KTM_530_Durty,3,Mon Jun 15 18:29:54 2015 UTC,Pshh.  I've got the Two Three Oh version of that bike and everyone knows the top riders can barely handle it.  It's so extreme none of them even use it.  I hit triples (3 very small bumps) every time I'm out and can rail a berm at 10+ km/hr.  Serious machine.

I Would suggest getting the orange powerband (fastest on the market) and getting your self some pro taper fat bars with hot pink half waffle grips, every good rider know that the half waffles give you the perfect amount of grip.

Motocross,39t8pd,illvillemx,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:07:19 2015 UTC,That seems to be the common answer from a few buddies of mine as well. They suggest Yamaha or KTM. What are your thoughts on brand?
Motocross,39t8pd,my2sak,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:57:51 2015 UTC,"I currently own a ktm 125, personally I really like it. The only problem I have is when something goes wrong my local shop dosent work on ktms. So if you do go the ktm route just make sure your local shop can work on them."
Motocross,39t8pd,Alsk1911,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:53:10 2015 UTC,"Get 2009+ KTM 125 SX or 150 SX. They're great. Yamaha has been making the same 2T engines for a lot of years now. KTM is actually improving them.   If you want to buy new, wait for 2016 models to come in, they've completely new engines and the whole bike weights like 5-10% less. (Plus I've seen 2016 350 SX-F preproduction model in person and it's gorgeous.)"
Motocross,39t8pd,savage24x,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:58:17 2015 UTC,"I always say Yamaha. Damn reliable bike. They're all reliable, it comes to preference. I rock team blue."
Motocross,39t8pd,KillYourTV,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:52:55 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with Yamaha, or an older CR Honda. Both of them would have plenty of parts available and the cost would be cheaper."
Motocross,39t8pd,Ktmktmktm,2,Wed Jun 17 23:49:56 2015 UTC,125 any brand really
Motocross,39t8pd,KICKERMAN360,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:57:38 2015 UTC,"Any used 250F is probably clapped out. The valve seats are expensive to replace. A 125 will be the cheapest base cost, but a 250 2 stroke will probably be the cheapest in the long run. You'd probably be best on a 125cc on a track, but if you're doing trails go for a 250 2 stroke (if you can start it). Anything Japanese is pretty good: Honda/Yamaha, Suzuki and Kawasaki - in that order, are the best options. Don't get a KTM unless you want to pay a premium, plus, the older bikes aren't particularly good. Each ride will be $100-$150 in fuel, oil, food, track fees, maintenance etc so factor that in."
Motocross,39t8pd,BrapBattle,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:39:54 2015 UTC,Id mainly be riding on a track. Never have considered trails. Sounds something like a Honda or Yamaha is the way to go. Thanks for the info!
Motocross,39t8pd,kitten_547,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:47:43 2015 UTC,"I think you are better off going with a Yamaha. Yz's are extremely reliable, and their suspension is quite a bit better than a Honda right out of the box. Things to consider in chosing a used Yamaha is that in 05 they switched to Aluminum frames, and in 06 they upgraded to the SSS forks which are a huge improvement as far a suspension goes. The suspension before 06 was solid, but the SSS forks are a noticable difference and a huge step forward."
Motocross,39t8pd,Alsk1911,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:58:36 2015 UTC,"If you are wanting to race and do track, don't get anything less than a 250. If you become confident and do decide to race, in most races a 20 year old can't race a 125. Or at least from where I'm from."

Around 2010 and maybe 2009 they changed something and don't have as much problems. As far as I know, any of the EFI are MUCH better on valves. Don't know what their deal is but my dad has a 05 crf250x and if you ride it like a race bike, it'll eat them up. And we got the steel ones too."

Maybe an old KDX or something along those lines. Trying to turn a dirtbike into a street legal bike is a pain in the ass and kinda expensive."
Motocross,39nix9,blackjesus75,2,Sat Jun 13 02:00:05 2015 UTC,A Suzuki drz would be a good choice. Road legal and decent off road capabilities. It also has a bulletproof engine
Motocross,39nix9,angrygorrilla,2,Sat Jun 13 05:14:22 2015 UTC,DR650 would be my recommendation. They have made them for a very long time and they are very reliable. You could find an early to mid 90s in good shape for close to your budget
Motocross,39nix9,atistang,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:41:06 2015 UTC,If you are looking for a street legal one look at enduro bikes or supermotos. A bike like a WR400 would be good.

His budget is rather on the low side, so hopefully he can find something in that price range. Hell, at that price range, he is going to have to stick to ""this is what you get"" rather then ""this is what you can choose from"".

Motocross,39nix9,Rambles_Off_Topics,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:42:36 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat as you, except I was a little younger when I bought my first bike (21 now) if you are looking to ride strictly off road, I would suggest a 125 2stroke or a 250 2 stroke, (even though I ride a 4stroke) in my opinion 2 strokes are easier to learn to do your own maintenence on and cheaper (usually) to buy and maintain, also they teach stricter/ more precise gear shifting (I believe). Good luck and welcome to the soon to be addiction!"

Be prepared to spend a lot of time reading then buy a flow bench and a stack of cylinder heads to practice on.   Honda has also spent a considerable sum of money to optimize the head on that bike. More than likely there isn't much to be gained from porting the head.  Also someone that already knows what works isn't likely going to divulge that information in public."
Motocross,39dnqe,XR250rdr,3,Thu Jun 11 03:41:36 2015 UTC,youre better off sending it to a professional

Being a machinist that knows how to use tools to produce a desired outcome is one thing, but that doesn't mean he will know what outcome works best. There a lots of variables to take into consideration to do it right. And there is never a ""right"" way to do it. Some ports have better velocity at lower rpms but when you get higher up in the rpm then the port isnt big enough to get peak hp. And you want to match your type of porting to the type of came you will be using. If you do decide to send it out, I can connect you with a shop who does a few supercross teams bikes if you can't find anyone."

Motocross,39bx8k,efell,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:53:00 2015 UTC,"The compression feels a bit wierd, it is fine at first but when the kickstarter is down close to the footpeg there is no resistance and you can easily move it up and down. But it is only when its down there, before you hit that point it is fine.    I should probably mention this was the second ride after we replaced the head gasket and cylinder gasket."
Motocross,39au19,jarrodalex,2,Wed Jun 10 14:23:38 2015 UTC,are you sure youre measuring them properly? Really strange for a 2014 to be going out of spec that often
Motocross,39au19,ImA_Schmeckbeard_AMA,2,Wed Jun 10 16:34:55 2015 UTC,"Yea,  that's pretty quick. Once they are out of spec though shimming them just prolongs the inevitable.

I'm no mechanic but I believe both high RPM and low octane fuel increase pre-detonation, so if you are using 91 and are on the rev limiter a lot, you could be wearing things more quickly.

Motocross,393ks9,MrZakk15,7,Tue Jun 9 00:32:34 2015 UTC,"In my experience, I always get new plastics, and looking at your bike, youre definitely going to want to get new ones as well because of all the scratches. Its not going to be fun putting them on over the scratches and expecting them to stay on. In short, buy yourself new plastics and save yourself some hurt. Your tank should also not be a problem, though I'm not 100% (no pun intended) sure what you're doing with it.   Tips to consider:   1: Apply your graphics on your plastics off the bike, it will make it much easier to see and control.   2: Don't be afraid to peel it back and re-apply if you get bubbles. Sometimes these bubbles can be fixed with a quick passover of a blowtorch, but dont get too trigger happy with it.   3: Before applying, I like to spray my plastics with a glass cleaner. I never wipe it off, in the case that I need to peel it back and re-apply. Once the graphics are on, the glass cleaner wont make it slip off or come off any faster, its a useful technique I've learned.   4: This might be obvious but make yourself comfortable, and sit under a bright overhead light. If at all possible, get a family member or friend to help. They will control the blow dryer. A blow dryer on medium/high will substantially increase your graphics coverage and lower the amount of bubbles. If done correctly, it almost rids the need for the blowtorch mentioned earlier.  5: After all the graphics are applied, I let them sit for a few hours, preferably overnight so they can conform the the shape, and ""set-in."" Then feel free to instlal your plastics.   This process can be a pain in the ass, just have patience and theyll turn out great. Ill update this if I can think of anything else Im missing. In the meantime, feel free to ask questions!"
Motocross,393ks9,SneakyAardvark,2,Tue Jun 9 01:41:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for the long write up! I'll buy new plastics first.
Motocross,393ks9,CaptainGnar,3,Tue Jun 9 02:13:33 2015 UTC,"Glad you posted this, I have a kit coming tomorrow in the mail and the other guy helped alot."
Motocross,393ks9,ultraLORD91,2,Tue Jun 9 02:06:53 2015 UTC,"Here is what I learned trying to do it myself:   Make sure the decals that go over the gas tank are perforated otherwise air bubbles/gas from the gas tank will start to leak through the tank and put bubbles in your stickers. If they aren't perforated go over the tank uniformly with a needle and perforate it once you have put the stickers on. I guess there is a spray that you can buy and do a wet application for vinyl graphics so that you can move them a bit once you apply them. Maybe someone here has some experience with it?  Before you buy new plastics. Take a magic eraser and a razor blade to them and they will basically look brand new. Those magic erasers are amazing. Just don't use them on anything painted or painted metal. The plastics that are spray painted I would buy new though.   I tried applying them myself and didn't have the patience for it. I paid someone who knew how to do it, do it for me. Worth the $80 in my opinion."
Motocross,393ks9,hollacaust,2,Tue Jun 9 02:36:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but the plastics that are painted is the tank. Buying a new tank, is way out of my budget."
Motocross,393ks9,Mschultz33c,2,Tue Jun 9 03:00:42 2015 UTC,If your plastics aren't too beat up you can use them. First scuff the plastics with a green scotch bright pad to rough up the surface to provide good contact.  Soak the plastics in windex and apply graphics with a heat gun removing all the bubbles and form fitting it as you go.

Motocross,38rah1,ImA_Schmeckbeard_AMA,2,Sat Jun 6 03:59:10 2015 UTC,How often are you using your clutch when you ride? Is it set up properly? If this happens more than once or twice you should be worried about debris floating around in your engine.
Motocross,38rah1,Meebert,2,Sat Jun 6 05:57:04 2015 UTC,1) every 3 seconds  2) not at all  Its gotten to a point where I pull 10 or 12 pieces of shattered clutch plate out of my bike

Motocross,38i2d4,thelangdon,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:16:58 2015 UTC,Thank you! Best sport in the world. You can't go wrong. A 125 is a good bike to start on I would say. The YZ is pretty reliable. After a year or two its time for a 4-stroke :)
Motocross,38i2d4,thelangdon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:30:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah had a few people say YZ to me, just not enough of them around my area that are in a good state but ill find one.

Motocross,38i2d4,thelangdon,2,Fri Jun 5 09:54:59 2015 UTC,"Start small. A 450 will ruin Motocross for you :) 125 is great to learn basics like bike controls, balance, small jumps etc and then a 250f is easy as pie to ride. Also best advice I can give you: invest in a decent helmet. I run a 6D. Bell and Shoei also make great helmets."
Motocross,38i2d4,ImA_Schmeckbeard_AMA,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:58:45 2015 UTC,Cheers buddy and yeah I intended to spend as much on boots and a helmet as I do the bike!
Motocross,38i2d4,thelangdon,0,Sat Jun 6 11:54:53 2015 UTC,"a top of the line helmet and boots will cost you about $1000 together, which will get you a pretty ratted out shitty bike"
Motocross,38i2d4,eye_of_the_sloth,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:25:42 2015 UTC,Yeah that's the aim. A cheap yz 125 or something to blitz about on and make sure I actually enjoy what I'm doing. Wouldn't want to finance a 4 grand bike and regret it later.
Motocross,38i2d4,eye_of_the_sloth,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:25:32 2015 UTC,"Great film, as a sound guy, I noticed the speech in the interview scene with the stories about each helmet was a little quite, and then it went right into the thunderous drums that were much louder.  Perhaps bring those two scenes to closer DB's.  Just my 2 cents.   Great film dude, I love the cinematography and the concept.  Needs more views!!!"
Motocross,38gywv,THE_WHITEST_DUDE,2,Thu Jun 4 03:33:49 2015 UTC,"I always keep the base layer tear-off on there, but when I go to clean them, I just grab a real nice, soft cloth, and some foam glass cleaner. I pop my lens out and handle with care, cleaning inside and out. The stuff I get cleans real nice, leaves no streaks, and I like the smell. I believe its called Horizon Glass Cleaner.   Edit: Take my input with a grain of salt, I dont have nearly as expensive goggles."
Motocross,38gywv,SneakyAardvark,2,Thu Jun 4 03:50:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I used to just pour water on my old ones and wiped them with a soft towel but not gonna do that to these ones hah, I'm more worried about using a chemical on them and have it end up ruining the whole ""transitional"" effect they have. I really doubt that's possible but I have no clue how they actually work"
Motocross,38gywv,SneakyAardvark,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:00:57 2015 UTC,"It looks like they're just mirrored, but if you're still worried, Id go the safe route and actually just use a bit of water and a microfiber cloth. Be real gentle."
Motocross,38gywv,blackjesus75,3,Thu Jun 4 04:18:53 2015 UTC,Who the fuck would buy a lens for 160.
Motocross,38gywv,xCOMUNEx,2,Thu Jun 4 04:37:44 2015 UTC,"I would only need to spend $88 so the price really isn't that bad for me but the price is understandable if you had some more knowledge about the actual lens. Its not 100% Dragon that's making them, the ""transition"" part is from the actual company Transitions. So they would be getting a cut of the money as well so the price will be a little higher. Just like you would see with a helmet that's made by a certain company but is covered with Monster Energy or Red Bull or whatever. Also the lenses work really well, honestly you would need to try them for yourself though"
Motocross,38gywv,Youwishh,4,Thu Jun 4 04:57:58 2015 UTC,"Damn, $88 would still get you a new set of 100% goggles and a replacement lens. Expensive goggles are nice but motocross isn't too good at keeping gear pristine"
Motocross,38gywv,CORNDOG21,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:07:35 2015 UTC,"I'm all to familiar with that, which is why I wanna make these things last. I wouldn't even think about getting stuff like this without my sponsorship's but I've always had fairly cheap goggles and was ready to try something that was more top of the line. So far very happy with them though"
Motocross,38gywv,price1869,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:13:37 2015 UTC,Haha I'm with you. I Fuck up my lenses way too much to pay that.
Motocross,38gywv,Youwishh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:23:10 2015 UTC,What makes the transition lens superior to the others? Is it polarized? A different material. I'm curious.
Motocross,38gywv,soproductive,2,Thu Jun 4 14:31:00 2015 UTC,"I'm going to just go out on a limb (and not actually google anything) but I'm guessing it might be like the transition lenses for glasses. They darken when UV hits them, so they're lighter when the light is dim and then darken when you're in the sun and need it more.  I could totally be making this up, so don't believe anything I say.  Edit: http://www.dragonalliance.com/en-us/snow-goggles/advanced-projects-x-105310/722-4803-999"
Motocross,38gywv,bluecompton,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:36:01 2015 UTC,"When it gets real sunny out side they'll change from a clear yellow tint to a much darker black tint but you won't notice the change while riding. And if it's dark outside or really shady (like trail riding in a forest) they'll change to a more clear yellow version. This is the whole point of them, you won't ever need to swap lenses because these ones do it for you, and when you're out racing or riding you actually can't tell if they're changing colors, they're made so no matter how bright/dark it is outside you will always see the same, if that makes sense. There's a video on YouTube of them changing color when put in direct sunlight"
Motocross,38gywv,Mitchmitchhh,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:54:59 2015 UTC,"That's actually sick. I want to try them now even though it's way expensive, maybe I'll use them for practice only or something."
Motocross,38eqom,Rokyr,4,Wed Jun 3 18:56:22 2015 UTC,You have to remember that you get what you pay for.  Buying brands noone has ever heard of may save you a few bucks but it could really hurt you in the end (literally)
Motocross,38eqom,fuelgun,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:15:43 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, and I guess that's why I'm posting here. I know there are some brands out there that are well known but make bad products, not necessarily related to MX gear. I was just hoping to avoid those ones in this situation.  Well the boots I'm looking at are Thor and Fly racing, which I've heard of but I'm not sure of quality."
Motocross,38eqom,therealbabytooth,7,Wed Jun 3 20:19:10 2015 UTC,"I bought some fly boots once. they were on sale for $100. seemed like a good deal at the time. couple months later I bought some tech 10s. spend the dough, it's worth it!"
Motocross,38eqom,unabiker,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:28:14 2015 UTC,I think the real lesson here is that $100 pair of boots is not the same quality as a $600 pair of boots.
Motocross,38eqom,RyanTally,0,Thu Jun 4 14:56:29 2015 UTC,"Second this, fly boots are fucking garbage.   First week, strap broke.  After a month my kick start had worn a hole in the bottom of the boot. Nothing like hitting a small puddle and then having wet socks all day long."
Motocross,38eqom,AG27214,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:09:34 2015 UTC,Ive ridden with tech 7s for 10+ years. Loved every single pair of Alpinestars I have had.
Motocross,38eqom,fuelgun,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:48:38 2015 UTC,"They are about the same, although Thor is a bigger name.  I always ride Alpinestars, though."
Motocross,38eqom,chiappetta13,3,Wed Jun 3 20:47:46 2015 UTC,"It depends on your budget and type of riding. Riding gear is dependent on your choice of style and design. Moose, answer, and fly are good reasonably priced gear options. I recommend getting higher end boots because of the higher safety and feature sets they are equipped with. Spending some extra cash now can save you from a bad experience down the road. Gaerne, Sidi, Fox Instincts, and the new fly boots are all viable options."
Motocross,38eqom,clumsy_Ninja,2,Wed Jun 3 20:19:03 2015 UTC,"As far as gear, alias is doing a ""direct to rider"" sale online. They are good quality and you can get Jersey and pants for $70 I think. Boots last years and are important to keep you safe, save up the extra money and buy some good alpinestars or gaerne's"
Motocross,38eqom,KICKERMAN360,0,Wed Jun 3 21:29:21 2015 UTC,"Also, don't get white boots because they're hard to keep clean. Well, the white discolours easily and is really hard to get new again."

Motocross,38eqom,clumsy_Ninja,3,Wed Jun 3 23:20:00 2015 UTC,No way! White boots are the tits! Just got to use comet and wash them every ride

Motocross,38eqom,SneakyAardvark,2,Sat Jun 6 05:43:28 2015 UTC,"I would go with Alias's new Direct 2 Rider system, because those prices are unbeatable, and the quality is unfathomable. Spend a high dollar on good boots and helmet. You wont regret getting good boots and a helmet.   Stay away from the Fox Comp 5! Buckles suck!"
Motocross,38eqom,IAmNamedMatt,2,Wed Jun 3 23:56:58 2015 UTC,Yeah i have comp 5's and can agree with this! Not terrible though its just the one above the last at the toe is annoying!
Motocross,38eqom,SneakyAardvark,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:22:21 2015 UTC,"Its always that one! Right after I start my bike I have to re-buckle it, then ride, re-buckle, rest, re-buckle. Its a constant struggle."
Motocross,38eqom,justin_144,2,Thu Jun 4 00:57:54 2015 UTC,"Gaerne Boots are one of the top boot companies. Some other good ones are Sidi, Alpine Star, and I think Fox has been getting serious in the boot business lately. Once I tried on my first pair of Gaerne's, I don't think I'll ever get anything else. Super comfortable and just a really good boot.  If they're too pricey for you, see if you can find some used ones or open up an account on HookIt and get a sponsorship through them."
Motocross,38eqom,AS82,3,Thu Jun 4 01:09:55 2015 UTC,"Don't buy alpine star tech 3's.  A lot of new riders get them and they are a not a good boot.  Every other boot by alpine star is, and regardless of brand you'll get what you pay for...but just trust me and avoid the Tech 3.  Buckles were terrible and required much force to close, fixed that with a dremel.  Sole wore quickly.  Sole separated from boot.  I had a bad experience as have many other new riders in my area with this boot."
Motocross,38eqom,__Slayer__,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:59:10 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this also, I got my Tech 3s ten years ago, and they are still in one piece and very wearable.  I have since upgraded to Tech 8s. I would say that Tech 3s are your minimum 'boot on a budget', I would be very wary of going any cheaper.  I'm not impressed with the construction of Fox boots."
Motocross,38eqom,nrvale00,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:19:31 2015 UTC,I'm with you. My Tech 3's have been durable but the latches are impossible when dirty and the soles are treacherously slick when wet. Like ice on the foot pegs after a creek crossing. I can't afford to replace them right now but SOON!
Motocross,38eqom,Mschultz33c,0,Thu Jun 4 01:44:14 2015 UTC,"I'm in disagreement with this. I have work in in a motorcycle dealership for more than 2 years now mainly in apparel sales. I sell more tech 3s than any other boot, and since I've started working there I've had only 2 pairs come back with issues. 1. A customer broke a buckle after having them for months and we sold him the replacement parts, he got them and came back the next day because he could not install the buckle receiver as it is held on by a river. We installed it for him. And 2. A customer bought a pair and on his 3rd week of owning them he punctured the inside of the right boot kick starting the bike, there is no warranty for that as its customer error. He still uses the boots with no issues.  The tech 3s are good beginner my boots because they are very rigid and will not hyper flex in a crash. They are fairly expensive, 249.99$ can. But IMO they are worth it. Fox boots are very flimsy and are comfy but do not provide much protection and stability. I had a pair of comp.5s and had 2 major ankle injuries. I've also owned alpinestars youth tech 6s, very satisfied with them, Thor quadrant boots, which were mediocre, and I now use sidi Crossfire 2s which are IMO the best mx boots money can buy. I've heard about people complaining of tech 3 buckles being hard to do up... I do it more than anyone that owns them and I can honestly say it's not that bad. Also it is a good thing, because you know they won't come undone while riding, which my comp.5s often did.   Tl.dr I think the tech 3s are your best bang for your buck offer good protection with little issues."
Motocross,38eqom,PBCookie,0,Wed Jun 3 21:53:04 2015 UTC,"My Tech 3s only lasted a season before the sole had worn pretty much all the way through.  Bought some gaerne SG10s and have had them for 5 years and they are pretty much as good as new.  The tech 3 is a very shitty boot, I'm not the only one that has had issues with them."
Motocross,38eqom,soproductive,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:34:28 2015 UTC,I have some Alpinestar tech 6's and they're great. No complaints and I've had em for years.
Motocross,38eqom,vitracker,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:12:39 2015 UTC,"It some fly boots on sale last year, really cheap and have held up great. I'm not a serious rider I should mention though."
Motocross,38eqom,b907,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:31:41 2015 UTC,"My best advice, that I wish someone told me long ago..  When buying boots, buy from a boot company. When buying a helmet, get one from a helmet company, and so on with every other piece of gear. Too many brands attempt to make ""everything"" and they typically suck."
Motocross,38eqom,unabiker,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:43:06 2015 UTC,"For the most part, you get what you pay for. If you are shopping for gear on eBay based mostly on price, don't be surprised if what you get is cheap shit.   Most gear brands make several different levels of gear. It's been my experience that the top of the line stuff lasts waaaay longer (years) than the entry level stuff. That $40 pair of riding pants might look like a deal next to the $120 pants. But if the $40 pants fall apart the second time you wear them, what have you saved?"

Motocross,38b399,BrapBattle,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:43:31 2015 UTC,Roczen is only at Dungeys level because he's still hurt. Once Roczen is fully healed Dungey will have nothing on him.

Motocross,38b399,Renchturner84,2,Wed Jun 3 04:54:08 2015 UTC,"how is he not consistent? he is consistently at the top, he struggled with starts last years supercross but seems to have dialed those down for outdoors. 5 for 5 is pretty consistent to me"
Motocross,38b399,boatsss,3,Wed Jun 3 15:54:49 2015 UTC,His starts did suck in supercross and he did make it to the top 3 when he didn't crash. Like it or not Dungey is now the model for consistency. He is fast but never riding on the ragged edge. Tomac is much better to watch but as we can see this year going 5 for 5 and then blowing out both shoulders isn't a good idea.
Motocross,38b399,Renchturner84,3,Wed Jun 3 16:20:03 2015 UTC,"Tomac wins races, Dungey wins championships. I wonder when tomac will mature  and get some control over the way he rides."

He is the best rider on the track period, Just look at the standings and the results he is the best, hate when people come saying "" Dungey get handed every Championship"" NO, he Deservers everyone off them."
Motocross,38b399,Norsport,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:15:32 2015 UTC,"I was being sarcastic before, but I believe people say he is ""handed"" the title because when other peoples favorite competitors are injured out, he only has to worry about his attendance and consistency. Sure Tomac, Roczen, Canard, and others definitely have the talent to beat him, but people are tired of seeing him win."

Probably time to take it to someone and have it serviced.   Also, if the bike is stock, the springs are too light for you. Go here: http://racetech.com/ChooseVehicle.aspx and figure out what springs you need."
Motocross,383gyi,price1869,2,Mon Jun 1 16:37:23 2015 UTC,"I can't recommend enough that you take your forks apart and put new springs on for your correct weight. Doing it yourself will give you a very good idea on how these things work.  Also, once your springs are right, adjusting (slightly) the oil amount will dramatically alter the feel you get in the front end."
Motocross,383gyi,1inTheAir,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:19:20 2015 UTC,"Will do my plan here soon was to at least change the oil and seals just because, and my only hesitation on changing my springs right now is I am currently losing weight, down 20lbs in the past 2 months and plan on losing at least 20 more. It is for sure a plan in the future though"
Motocross,383gyi,Youwishh,2,Tue Jun 2 02:30:04 2015 UTC,"Here's some links that show basic suspension spec setups for all bikes/year, seems accurate enough and it's what I use as a base then go from there. You may need stiffer fork spring and rear spring for your weight it's probably harsh because your riding in mid valve all the time. Yamaha has the best stock suspension in the industry you will love it once setup. And you said it stays down when you push front end? Almost like you have a blown fork seal or something, that would explain the harshness too, get someone to look at it.   http://www.tech-care.com/kawasaki.php  http://www.tech-care.com/suzuki.php  http://www.tech-care.com/yamaha.php  http://www.tech-care.com/ktm.php  http://www.tech-care.com/honda.php"

Motocross,3803or,brappp428,2,Mon Jun 1 03:45:06 2015 UTC,Can't go wrong with the KLX110 or the CRF70. The 110 is bigger to start but heavy. The 70 is lighter but would require a bit of mods to get up to the 110s level. Good thing is a lot of parts that are listed for a CRF50 will also fit the 70. The TTR110 and the CRF110 are great bikes but there isn't many aftermarket parts for them.
Motocross,3803or,brappp428,2,Mon Jun 1 04:03:10 2015 UTC,"Buy a klx 110 simple as that. I used to race pit bike and a 110 is what you want. It has a huge upgrade market for them. a crf 50 is to small if you are an adult. Nothing else has the upgrades that you can do like the klx 110. But my advice is buy a stock bike put a pipe and a pod filter and keep it there. I have ran stock and mod and the stock bike is the fun, one even if you are looking to race it. What are your plans with it?"
Motocross,3803or,EnterFaster,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:39:48 2015 UTC,"Also more on what you where asking, BBR is just an aftermarket company that sells parts for a klx for example. It is not a ""pit bike"" company like pitster pro and other ""bike"" companies that you might have herd of. BBR sells quality parts and pister pro sells a Chinese version of a full mod klx. If you are really interested in a pit bike I can help you out, feel free to pm me."

Motocross,3803or,Jesse_J,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:45:06 2015 UTC,The 110L are a good choice too. It would be a perfect get a round bike because it is a little bit higher and they have a clutch which is a real big plus. Also www.planetminis.com is a big forum all about pit bikes.

Motocross,37wcnu,tnt6656,-7,Mon Jun 1 22:08:54 2015 UTC,Fuck! Another giftwrapped championship for Dungey. I really hope someone else can come up and beat him.
Motocross,37wcnu,chiappetta13,4,Sat May 30 23:22:10 2015 UTC,There is still Roczen but I hate this philosophy of gift wrapped championships.  He has only lost a championship to Poto and Roczen in the premier class. His skill set is always being there and pushing competitors to match his consistency. I don't even like Dungey but he gets shit for respect and he has earned every championship because he survives the attrition of a season. I'm a huge JS7 and can't wait to see him get back.
Motocross,37wcnu,SMACK-A-BRO,3,Sun May 31 00:30:29 2015 UTC,I feel the same way. I'm honestly a Suzuki fan so I like roczen but his attitude seems like he's slacking. Can't wait for js to come back though.  I feel bad for Tomac but he was pushing too hard when he didn't need to and it bit him in the ass hard. When your dominating like he was you can take a second to slow down and get in a nice pace. He just pushed when he didn't need to.
Motocross,37wcnu,BurningBeard24,-1,Sun May 31 00:39:35 2015 UTC,"Im pissed,  that corner took down both my riders and like you said get in a nice pace and maybe take a different line into that destroyed corner,  commentators didnt help by jinxing him 1 second earlier either"
Motocross,37wcnu,SMACK-A-BRO,2,Sun May 31 17:01:58 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing but it was bound to happen. That track was wicked bad. With all the time in between the 1st and 2nd motos they could smooth out some bad spots.  I grew up racing harescrambles so I'm no stranger to narly tracks but motocross is a completely different monster and this tracks was why to bad imo. Some grooming is good for the fans and riders.
Motocross,37wcnu,BurningBeard24,0,Sun May 31 17:19:57 2015 UTC,"Hopefully AMA takes that into account because it seems like after every heat in supercross they have bobcats out there fixing shit.  Especially when you compare track times between the 250s during qualifying and late moto 2.   It almost turns into a one line track, at least give them more opportunities this isnt nascar."
Motocross,37wcnu,RichieW13,1 point,Sun May 31 17:23:43 2015 UTC,commentators didnt help by jinxing him    Seriously?
Motocross,37wcnu,recon033,2,Mon Jun 1 06:06:44 2015 UTC,"You can't deny dungey is a work horse. same with tomac.  There is nobody out there working harder than those two.  Dungey is always there grinding away and this is his first year actually having a trainer plus he's on a brand new bike.  It took him a while to get it dialed in indoors I bet its the same thing for outdoors.  Tomac has a lot of good years ahead of him too.  You can't say dungey is gift wrapped a championship, I don't know how people can not like him. Its good to see roczen healthy as well.  Sucks he got a flat.  Can't wait to see js7 back....man that track was rough today."
Motocross,37wcnu,SpiLLiX,6,Sun May 31 02:07:42 2015 UTC,"what? Dungey always adapts and i guarantee within a few rounds would be every bit as fast as Tomac if not faster. Consistency is as much a talent as raw speed is. Just look when he was going head to head with poto, they were consistently trading wins and the only reason Dungey lost that championship is because his bike ran out of gas the last lap with a big lead in Texas at Freestone.  To say any pro was handed anything is just plain idiotic. They are battling against the fastest other 40 riders in the entire continent. But yeah those riders just hand it over."
Motocross,37wcnu,SVT-Cobra,5,Sun May 31 03:19:16 2015 UTC,"I hate the people give Dungey so much disdain likes he's not worthy of his championships. He is such a humble guy and is someone I would want my kids to look up to.   Tracks are so dangerous, technical, and fast now that raw speed is no longer the most desired trait; consistency is. Honestly I don't think anyone will ever beat Dungey's consistency either!"
Motocross,37wcnu,BrapBattle,2,Sun May 31 03:38:12 2015 UTC,"i guarantee within a few rounds would be every bit as fast as Tomac if not faster.   Yeah, thats quite a stretch. I agree, dungey usually gets stronger through the season and consistency is just as much of a factor in winning a championship as pure speed is, but I really dont think Dungey (or anyone for that matter) has the sheer speed and riding ability as Tomac does right now. Dungey has always been fast, but the reason everyone gives him shit is because pretty much every season there are a couple riders who have better speed than him who either DNF, or just flat out crash out of the series, which leaves the next fastest guy to clean it up, and that next fastest guy is almost always Dungey.   Again, im not trying discredit Dungey or any of his championships, but even with the best equipment out there (which dungey has had for the past few years) he is almost always just a bit off of the pace of one or two riders.... until they mess up their running points."
Motocross,37wcnu,SpiLLiX,1 point,Sun May 31 03:49:41 2015 UTC,"Idk I just don't agree. Dungeys bike has like significantly changed every year for the past few years. Look at all the super fast riders in the past. Stewart when he had a perfect season/dominated people, had rode nothing but Kawasaki. Poto? Nothing but kawi. Tomac ridden Honda ever since like what big bikes?   No matter how fast they are it's hard for pros to adapt at the very highest level. Just look at Stewart when he went to Yamaha. No offense but he was terrible in comparison to his kawi days. Idk I just think ktm has had a lot of changes, for the better, but changes none the less and that throws people off."
Motocross,37wcnu,BrapBattle,0,Sun May 31 03:59:07 2015 UTC,"Dungey has been working with KTM for long enough that comfort/adapting to that bike definitely wouldnt be an issue. Bike set up, which can change week to week, maybe, but its not like he isnt used to the bike or anything.   Even for those who have been loyal to one brand, every time they come out with a new generation it can be a big change for better or for worse, and like you listed Stewart is a perfect example. The 2010-2013 YZ450 was a radical change from what stewart won on with the 2009, and it was pretty clear Yamaha took a step in the wrong direction. Those new KTMs are definitely nothing but upgrades from an already great bike. They might still be dialing it in, (as would any bike/team being its early in the season) but there is no way the bike is what is holding Dungey back from the huge difference in lap times between him and Tomac.  Another thing is that just like Dungey, there are other riders who will get stronger as the season goes on. I would put money down that by the end of the season guys like Seely and Bagett will have a couple wins."
Motocross,37wcnu,recon033,1 point,Sun May 31 04:44:58 2015 UTC,Completely new bike geometry means new setups and responses to changes.  It took them a few rounds indoors this year and after they got it dialed it was tough to beat dungey and he was rattling off the wins. Outdoors brings all new setups to figure out.
Motocross,37wcnu,BrapBattle,0,Sun May 31 14:14:00 2015 UTC,"Yea I agree 100%, im just saying that Dungeys switch to KTM isnt at all a disadvantage over guys who have been loyal to one brand at this point. Like you said, each generation means a new bike to learn about and set up for the teams. They are probably still figuring the bike out, but thats no different from any other rider/team out there."
Motocross,37wcnu,recon033,1 point,Sun May 31 23:56:35 2015 UTC,You can't deny all the wins he had indoors after they dialed his bike in.  He led most of them holeshot to checkers.  But it took a while for them to get his bike dialed in...I'm just glad tomac learned how to start.
Motocross,37wcnu,SMACK-A-BRO,1 point,Sun May 31 14:15:31 2015 UTC,"Dungey gets shit done. If you noticed he didn't go down once in a Supercross main all year long. The dude doesn't ride over his head like other riders. Look at Tomac, fastest dude on a motorcycle but was riding over his head. Roczen, had the win but choked on the last lap. Dungey is there and deserves every bit of what he gets. I'm not even a Dungey fan but this is the truth. He rides smart, takes his time and pounces when it counts most."

You have to compress the spring so it's clear of the slide body, then push down on the cable a bit and move it out of the groove and its free.  Its kinda like the clutch cable where it meets the leverage arm on the motor case.  Edit: just saw your other post...looks like you are cleaning your carb?

Motocross,37oag8,HoneyBadgerRy,1 point,Sun May 31 12:06:16 2015 UTC,Push the cable down and pull it back up it should come right out. Pro tip: pull the spring up and out a pair of mini visegrips on the wire to hold the spring up and make your life easier.

The spring weight won't be as big a factor in whether or not you get bucked off the bike. You need to work on the compression and rebound (although starting with the correct springs would help a ton).

The 50's fouled a spark plug every other time you started it (we still have spare ones laying around and this was twenty years ago) and if you didn't have to change the plug, there was another problem. Suspension problems, carburetor problems, anything could happen at any time on those things. We had all the versions of it, the original white and purple ones, then the 50jr and 50sr  Then we got the 65's. They were so new when we got them the dealer didn't even assemble them, we just grabbed the crates. Out of the box, the cases wouldn't fit onto the bike at all. So we got new ones shipped from Austria two weeks later. Then my brother cracked his frame in half under the gas tank so we had to get it welded. The throttles stuck, the suspension and carburetor were still awful but they somehow managed to almost double the plug life to a whopping four starts before it junked them.   Thankfully, we opted for a pair of YZ85's and KTM eventually got their mini line in order a few years later."

Motocross,37bxjs,MxProdigy17,2,Tue May 26 21:43:52 2015 UTC,The fun factor of this game is how difficult it really is. It is not a game that anyone can pickup and play. It takes a shit ton of time to just be able to make it around a lap without crashing and until you are really able to learn the physics of it.
Motocross,37bxjs,Redirected,6,Tue May 26 16:57:54 2015 UTC,I just bought it yesterday and I think it's harder to pick up than IRL riding.

I would say these boots are good for the average to large calf. They are very durable. Decently breathable for how well they keep your feet dry in wet conditions.  Buckles have worked flawlessly for me.  I can't seem to wear the soles out. I have two pairs. A race pair and a practice pair. After a year of riding on the practice pair the soles are good and the boot has tons of protection. In comparison to tech 8s I can tell you these are highly superior in protection and comfort.

Motocross,37cni5,Kx_kid1,5,Tue May 26 17:29:46 2015 UTC,personal opinion is save a little longer for a full system or spend the money on something else. Motocross bikes dont have restrictive mufflers like DOT approved exhaust have. They are already high performance and the power gain from a slip on is not worth the hundreds of dollars they cost.

I would not expect this bike be as simple as bolt on a new piston and rings,  I suspect that it needs a lot more work on the chassis and I would think the motor as well."
Motocross,377dkg,KillYourTV,2,Mon May 25 23:49:40 2015 UTC,It's completely fucked if the price is that low.    That might depend on the area or the seller. Occasionally I've found some really great deals.  But I agree that I'd be suspicious. I'm not confident when the advertiser gives such little info and doesn't put any close-up images (that might show more of its condition). I think it might be worth a phone call to find out more.

Motocross,377dkg,Ringo911,1 point,Mon May 25 15:04:01 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of things you need to look at before you buy. The engine is #1, but you should check the swingarm, frame, forks, brakes, and more. This video is the best I've found for knowing what to check for. EDIT: Also check the front end of the swingarm to make sure there's no damage from the chain."
Motocross,377dkg,Ringo911,2,Mon May 25 16:09:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  If you buy a used bike be prepared to look at the bearings, brakes, and suspension.  The drive train is easy to diagnose but the others are not and I would flush the brakes and suspension as well to keep it fresh and pray that there are no problems with those systems.  That wont cost too much but oil will be around 50-75 for the suspension and if you pay someone you are looking at 200+.  It needs to be done though,  all of us have ridden old bikes with soft suspension and this is usually why,  The oil is old and worn out and just like the motor it needs replaced. Just something to consider."
Motocross,377dkg,ImA_Schmeckbeard_AMA,2,Mon May 25 23:46:15 2015 UTC,Keep this in mind.  There is always more wrong with it then the owner is letting on.  Although if you do not mind spending say 1500 to get the bike working properly which I may add is a lot less than buying a brand new bike or late model bike.  If you have good mechanical skills it may be worth it.

Motocross,378eri,bluecompton,3,Mon May 25 18:48:08 2015 UTC,On the start hold a finger on the front brake so that you can feel where the clutch will engage without rolling.  Watch the gate pin not the gate itself.  Have you buddy pack dirt around the back of your rear wheel to help stop initial spin.  Practice 1 start at the beginning of every moto.  DO NOT practice starts over and over or you will burn up your clutch.
Motocross,378eri,AS82,1 point,Mon May 25 19:59:02 2015 UTC,"I already do this. I used to hold the front brake, but you can find the biting point without it, and i've found I personally gate better. Idk if you hold the brake or not, but maybe try it without just to see."

Motocross,378eri,ride-mx,1 point,Mon May 25 22:34:28 2015 UTC,"My trick (I get good starts) is really simple.  Watch the starter, after he points at everyone and climbs into the box, he has a really consistent rhythm.  Find some point to use as a reference, like when he's walking back and his feet go out of view (depending on your gate style) - At this point I start counting ""mississippi's.""  Do this while waiting for your gate for around 5+ gates.  You'll find that every gate is almost always the same exact count.  Usually around 5 mississippi.  Now at race time, use that same count method because staring at a gate with no time reference feels like an eternity, but if you count down 1-mississippi, 2-mississippi, 3...etc.  When you get to 5 you can almost dump the clutch and go, or at least really know when it's about to drop.  I've been on gates where dudes are burning out making tons of smoke trying to get an edge and I would just relax sitting there and usually beat them.  I find packing the dirt does help as well but mostly just to keep my mind busy with something other than worrying about getting the hole shot."
Motocross,378eri,GoneMildToWild,1 point,Mon May 25 20:17:21 2015 UTC,"I find keeping the a really clear mind works well on the gate too.  The problem is not all starters do have a consistent rhythm, which is kind of a pain. I've been at clubs where they drop the gate instantly after 5, and I've literally been to one today where my dad timed 7-9 seconds after the 5 second board, he drops."
Motocross,378eri,baconpant,1 point,Mon May 25 21:10:09 2015 UTC,"For me starts began to come with routine and mindset. I always do the following: Set holeshot device, fix goggles, get up on the tank, take slack out of pants, relax and focus on the first corner, once board turns to five click into gear, when board turns get rpms up and feather clutch until bite, and then watch it until gate drop.   Just try to do the same thing every time and you'll feel more relaxed and focused on the first corner."

As I'm sure you know, that GoPro needs to be pretty close (unless you shoot in 4K or 2.7 and punch in in post, which I did a lot). I could tell a few of the riders noticed it flying around and started throwing some whips on the jumps for the camera, which was awesome!  4) It is.

Motocross,370yut,spottedmarley,2,Sat May 23 23:55:17 2015 UTC,"I want to go buy a new bike but therein lies a conudrum. I'm no good on a 450 because a) I shouldn't really go too fast and b) I'm way too light. And I don't really want a 250F because valve jobs aren't fun. Which leaves the 2 strokes and Yamaha isn't really doing much with the YZ range, so it leaves the Euro bikes, namely KTM. Thus I can envision my future ""new"" bike being a KTM 125 or 150. And this is from someone who has only owned Honda (and a few Chinese pit bikes, and Polaris famr quads)."

TLD for whatever reason really fits well and seems more cumfy than a lot of other brands I've tried. I bet Seven gear is the same way, TLD makes that stuff too."
Motocross,371vd1,spottedmarley,1 point,Sun May 24 18:43:08 2015 UTC,"I've been using O'neal, it's not the nicest gear out there but it's affordable at least. I have 2-3 sets that I rotate through and it all stays in pretty good condition."
Motocross,371vd1,blackjesus75,1 point,Sun May 24 19:37:14 2015 UTC,I switched from FOX to Fly a long time ago. I feel their prices are great and the quaility is pretty dang good. I wear all gear and even helmet. Boots remain Alpine Stars.

Motocross,371vd1,SVT-Cobra,1 point,Sun May 24 22:42:48 2015 UTC,What style of Alpine stars? They are quite expensive like 599 or 499.
Motocross,371vd1,SVT-Cobra,1 point,Sun May 24 23:34:09 2015 UTC,"The Tech 3 All Terrains. Got them for $230.00. I got them because they are the best/cheapest boots with a thin non-composite sole. The bottom has raised section with ridges, but if you like the more slick pure MX style sole then you can sand paper the ridges down or else you might have a little more grip on the pegs than you'd like. Here they are."

Motocross,36x2f8,super_average,2,Fri May 22 23:37:29 2015 UTC,He also had dehydration issues during MX last year and wasn't fully cleared for this year I believe.
Motocross,36x2f8,Pvt_Redbeard,3,Sat May 23 00:09:35 2015 UTC,I get the feeling that there may also be a bit of a desire on Mookie's part to show some solidarity with his brother and sit out the nationals too. He's always made a point during interviews to express his disappointment over what he clearly sees as an injustice being suffered by James and this whole stupid wada thing. Kinda like it's both the Stewarts or none. I'm not suggesting this is the main reason he's not racing but I feel certain that there is at least a little of it in there.

Motocross,36uam3,rhysthomas77,2,Fri May 22 09:42:43 2015 UTC,To be honest I only saw Savatgy on the Main track. I was there about 12-3pm and I think most of the Pro's had ended their motos prior to that. I saw Jeremy Martin pulling off and packing up as I was pulling my gear on.  Then I see AC50 roll by out of nowhere when I was packing up. Then CA66.. I was like 'wtf did they come from'. Next thing you know they are all over on the Vet Track doing practice starts. Pretty funny and CA66 would actually tear through a few sections of the Vet. The other two would just roll around mellow and cut back over to the gate.  Most dudes were at Glen Helen yesterday.

Motocross,36l1rr,kenneth__blankenship,3,Wed May 20 04:16:55 2015 UTC,"A multimeter won't be able to test the stator unless you have a peak voltage detector adapter (it's too slow to record the peak). Fortunately you can make one for next to nothing (done it before:http://www.thumpertalk.com/topic/1034259-build-your-own-peak-voltage-adapter/). Secondly I'd double check the clamps on the intake because an air leak would cause the bike to need the choke. The choke richens the fuel, so without the choke it would be too lean (if there's an air leak). This video explains an air/fuel/pilot screw and how to set it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm5mB3R8Ucw. Lastly, you could purchase a leak down tester which would tell you if you have worn valves, rings or a head gasket leak. And give the valve clearances a check"
Motocross,36l1rr,KICKERMAN360,1 point,Wed May 20 05:46:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you for taking the time to give me so much info.  I don't have a soldering iron to make peak voltage adapter, so Ill go the route of checking for an air leak first.  I did see this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R5DhvkGQXs, where the guy was checking his stator with just a normal multimeter.  However in the manual it does not mention this method.   I was thinking about spraying starting fluid lightly around the intake past the carb to see if the bike accelerates. Don't see why that wouldn't work.  I'll try and resetting the pilot screw and let you know how it goes today.  Thanks again."
Motocross,36l1rr,KICKERMAN360,1 point,Wed May 20 12:15:46 2015 UTC,"I mocked one up using alligator clips, no soldering required (I was lazy). You can check other values with the multimeter but the peak voltage is the most important. It's also really hard to have a yes/no answer on if the stator is the problem unless you have a known working one to swap in."
Motocross,36l1rr,price1869,4,Wed May 20 12:23:30 2015 UTC,"Your timing is off.   wait, wait, wait ... I know, you lined up the marks on the sprocket perfectly, checked twice, blah, blah, etc.   The sprocket is press fit onto the cam and under certain circumstances can ""slip"" causing the timing to be off. Your choices are: 1. Take the cam and head to a machine shop and have them degree the cam. 2. buy a new cam on ebay. Personally, I found it cheaper and easier to just do #2.  (heh - #2)  Just to clarify - the cam chain sprocket itself is not press fit, but the piece it bolts to is. Same difference.  Edit: Not sure why this is downvoted. I'll put good money on this being the problem. I've owned and operated on 5 different '04-'06 CRF 450s in the last 2 years. I'm sadly very familiar with that engine."
Motocross,36l1rr,price1869,1 point,Wed May 20 13:58:32 2015 UTC,"Wow man. I think you are right.   I checked tdc and the cam alignment marks looked good.   Checked to make sure I was getting spark. That was fine.   Pulled and inspected the stator. Just to try and rule that out.   The valves are practically brand new. As well as the piston. The engine shop I used to do the work didn't inspect the came very well I'm assuming.   http://imgur.com/a/niHaR  I'm correct in the thought that the cam intake lobes should be roughly 180 degrees from where they are right now?  Everything lined up. Flywheel, crank, and cam indicator, and all at tdc.   I didn't down vote you BTW. I appreciate your time."
Motocross,36l1rr,price1869,1 point,Thu May 21 03:17:06 2015 UTC,"Usually it only slips a few degrees. How are you checking the valve clearance with the cam in that position? You might just need to take out the allen bolts, rotate the cam 180 degrees and bolt it all back up.   I'd give it a try. Then I'd fire any shop that's been inside the head cover of that bike."

I don't have feeler gauges or a shim kit to check the valves. I have to get a longer flat head screw driver tomorrow morning so I can loosen the chain tensior before I can mess with the cam.    If pull the cam bolts and rotate the cam, will the mark still line up? Or am I just rough estimating at that point. Also, when you bought a cam on eBay did u buy a aftermarket one like hot cams or did you get an OEM cam?"

I stole the cam out of the spare head when I needed it, so ... OEM.  Run down to Autozone and buy a set of feelers. They're like $8. You don't have to buy an entire shim kit.

Motocross,36ixt0,price1869,3,Tue May 19 18:55:50 2015 UTC,"Raced this weekend with the Steg Pegz, and because of the interest in my previous post, I wanted to post a followup.  Let me start with this disclaimer. I made wholesale changes to this bike between the last race and this one, and didn't have a chance to ride it inbetween.   Changes since the last time I rode bike:    Full suspension service and revalve from Factory Connection - So plush! Fastway footpegs in the low-boy position (10mm down, 10mm back - noticeable, but not the amazing difference I keep reading about. Steg Pegz   I'm new enough to mx that I didn't grow up doing it. I suck at using my clutch, and I'm horrible about squeezing the bike with my knees. But really, the knee thing is almost impossible. To effectively squeeze with my knees, I would have to be in such a hunched up stance that there's no way I could stay like that for 10 minutes, much less the 4 hours that it's taking me to finish some of these races.  As I'm trying to get serious about going faster, I decided to just dive in and see if the steg pegz are for me. Apparently they're not that popular here in the states, but the Aussies love them. I'm not going to say that I love them just yet, but my initial impression is that they're extremely helpful. My knees are well above the seat unless I'm crouched stupidly low, so I pretty much only have the option to squeeze with my calves. The pegs give you something to squeeze and pull back against.    When I initially put them on the bike, I thought they were a little too far back, so I moved them both forward about 1/2"". The left side seemed perfect during the race, the right seemed to be just a tick too far forward.  It pushed my foot up on the peg too far so it felt like I was fighting it a little. I'll probably move it back on the right side to the stock position.  So the real question - are they worth $150? To me, yes. Even though the photo doesn't show it, I would say I was squeezing the bike 50-60% more during this race than I was in the last one. I still have to be very conscious of it, but the end result is I'm way less tired, and I'm faster.  Edit: I wear Alpinestar Tech 8 boots which are pretty soft compared to a lot of other boots. The pucks hit me right in the leather patch.  Edit 2: Pic in case you forgot.  http://i.imgur.com/6XPMYjR.png"

Motocross,36h3ev,spottedmarley,1 point,Tue May 19 13:08:01 2015 UTC,Just get a 2015 YZ250F ... best of both worlds  Tons of power and light as a 250 .. or a KTM250-SXF if you can afford one  450s will soon be a lot like the 500cc 2-strokes used to be ... just too much power  the 250F's are already better than the 2-stroke 250s used to be  it's like every class in motocross has shifted forward to replace the class that was previously above it..   125s became 250s that are faster than the old 250s  250s became 450s that are faster than the old 500s

Motocross,36cpbu,Alsk1911,3,Mon May 18 20:32:20 2015 UTC,"Only for taking off. Starts can be either first or second depending on the surface.  EDIT: And if I'm in some really tight woods I'll kick it down to first. With stock gearing, the tight stuff can require a lot of clutch, even in first gear. Also in the pits I generally keep it in first."
Motocross,36cpbu,Ih8Hondas,2,Mon May 18 15:14:30 2015 UTC,"Where I used to go riding they had a communal area for prepping that was strictly first gear only, but other than that I didn't really use it much."
Motocross,36cpbu,ItsSomethingLikeThat,2,Mon May 18 11:06:30 2015 UTC,"Mostly just use 2nd and the clutch. If im on a track and its a really, really tight corner then maybe. Used to on my 125 a bit though, just to keep the revs high"

Motocross,36cpbu,Youwishh,2,Mon May 18 13:32:13 2015 UTC,"I do a lot of woods riding in northern mi. With the switch backs being so tight and the incline of the trail being so drastic, first gear gets used a lot. Using second instead would be so much more clutch work."
Motocross,36cpbu,Teamrayray,2,Mon May 18 15:56:33 2015 UTC,"At first I thought you were asking if I used first gear like fox gear, ansr gear, or Troy lee designs gear haha. But I actually use first gear a lot when I'm doing a lot of single track turny stuff. But I have a 450 which has a lot more power than your 150 which is probably why."
Motocross,36cpbu,AlcoholicCelery,1 point,Mon May 18 16:51:29 2015 UTC,"I use my 1gear mainly through long mud patches and things like that. If it's  slippery enough I have to use the clutch a bit to keep traction, that's about it though."
Motocross,36cpbu,CaptainGnar,2,Mon May 18 12:17:51 2015 UTC,I'd go for a higher gear in muddy parts to keep the torque as the lower gear has more aggressive power?
Motocross,36cpbu,DTN101,1 point,Mon May 18 17:39:51 2015 UTC,I have more trouble balancing than anything in these muddy sections. I have found I can just paddle foot through and use my clutch as traction control. Second gear or higher tends to stall out when I go at that slow of a pace. I do still have stock gearing though on a YZ250F.
Motocross,36cpbu,CaptainGnar,1 point,Mon May 18 18:50:33 2015 UTC,"Your having trouble balancing because your going too slow. Impossible to stall in second gear with clutch in mud, pin that bitch and feather clutch. Hell I prefer third gear mostly on 250fs in mud. Stock or not."
Motocross,36cpbu,Youwishh,1 point,Thu May 21 17:46:29 2015 UTC,"That is what I do in shorter mud patches, but the ones I mean are a good 30ft long or so and pining it never works out for me in those lol Maybe eventually I'll get better though!"

Motocross,36bzm4,KICKERMAN360,5,Mon May 18 05:33:53 2015 UTC,"Go to your nearest local race and see what the 85cc kids are doing. They're pretty quick these days. And then see which class he should enter and let him race. The short of it is motocross is expensive. Very expensive. Hate to break it to ya, but a top end on an 85 is the minor end of the spectrum as far as costs go. If your brother is any good he'll need suspension done which is more than the $150 for a top end (you'll be in the thousands). Added to that is motor work, tyres and other spares (probably even a spare bike). Your best bet for a sponsor at this point is your local shop but unless your brother is producing results (i.e. winning some local races) you're gonna have to do it on your own dime for a little while at the very least. Also, most ""sponsorships"" are only discounts. Only good riders (with pages of wins) get free stuff and only the very very good actually get paid.  Another thing is we all think we could have been the next Rocky Carmichael if only we'd done more riding but the fact of the matter is all the top riders (with some very few exception who had good financial backing) started when they were 4 yrs old and raced and breathed motocross and solely MX for their whole lives. Most top riders don't have much of an education either (it's sad but true, Carmichael ain't good with words) so you have to consider that. But yeah, enter your brother into some races and take it from there."
Motocross,36bzm4,Ktmktmktm,2,Mon May 18 06:28:41 2015 UTC,Go racing? Also even if he is the fastest one out there if his fitness isn't on par with the other riders he will probably not do very good.

They pretty much just go, or you can look at the owners manual for the hourly interval. They can make a really bad rattling sound when its about to go, but at that point its already gone."
Motocross,367v60,Mr_Flacid,5,Sun May 17 01:33:06 2015 UTC,"Depends on how many hours on your bike/how hard you ride it/ how responsible you are with your maintainance. If you take apart your top end, take the piston off, pull the crank up and down at TDC to see if there is any play in it. If there is any play in it, it's time to rebuild it."
Motocross,367v60,KICKERMAN360,4,Sun May 17 01:22:36 2015 UTC,"You sort of don't unless you strip the engine down. An hour meter is the best tool for judging how worn something is. But signs your bottom end is going is metal filings in the oil. When the bottom end went on my bike (CR125, it was rod bearing) it made a knocking noise and was really hard to start. It sounded like piston slap actually. You can check for play in the crank on either side of the main bearings with the side covers off. It's unlikely you can tell when your crank is about to go if you don't know the hours on it."
