KarmaConspiracy,3bco2w,morpen,5,Sun Jun 28 05:05:52 2015 UTC,"Possibly. They could be nearly any Nvidia reference card from the 600 series on except for the Titan Black or the Titan X. Some Nvidia reference cards have branding behind the fan   that says which card they are, although I think that's only for the 780 Ti and the 980 Ti. Most Titan cards say Titan near the PCI bracket on the cooler.  The most obvious Titan to me is the black single fan one - that's a Titan X. The black one with no fans is a Fury X, which was supposed to be AMD's tiny, liquid cooled ""titan killer"" but early benchmarks show it just below a 980 Ti at 1080p and approximately equal to a Titan X at 4K.  I have a 285. It's not bad, but with only 2GB of VRAM, it would likely be crushed by any of these cards."
