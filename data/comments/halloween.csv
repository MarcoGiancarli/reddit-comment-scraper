halloween,3dwhi1,caddywompas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:35:29 2015 UTC,"I've never seen either of the movies....can anyone point me somewhere online where I can watch them? I've already checked Netflix and they're not on there. If not, does anyone know where I might buy the DVD's from?"
halloween,3dwhi1,gingerlovingcat,3,Mon Jul 20 19:45:34 2015 UTC,"The second movie is still in production, so that's why you can't find it haha. But the first one is on Amazon for dirt cheap, like $5 last I checked. I've also seen it in the $5 bin at FYE before. Great movie, you have to watch before (or on) Halloween this year!!"
halloween,3dwhi1,gingerlovingcat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:02 2015 UTC,Oooh. What store is FYE? I'll def get it before Halloween!
halloween,3dwhi1,gingerlovingcat,2,Tue Jul 21 05:02:54 2015 UTC,"Stands for ""For Your Entertainment,"" but's really only ever referred to as FYE. Probably don't have one in your area."

halloween,3djpiq,wookydoo,8,Thu Jul 16 20:41:02 2015 UTC,"Atmosphere. Atmosphere is very important in selling an idea/mood and setting. Its hard to describe, but a lot of people forget about sense of smell. If you have a fake pumpkin patch, for goodness sake - make it smell like earth/dirt/moss/garden. Smell really adds to the convincing setting.   Atmosphere includes things like lighting and ensuring scary places are appropriately dark/cold. The small touches that help trick the brain."
halloween,3djpiq,OnionOnYourBelt,5,Fri Jul 17 00:51:28 2015 UTC,"Start with a mandatory costume requirement, because having people 'get into character' makes for a better party over all.  There are literally hundreds of great ideas online for Halloween appetizers, drinks and foods - as mild or as gory as you want.  Some sort of haunted attraction people can walk through is always good - horse barn, garden maze, whatever's feasible for your location.  Strategically-placed smoke machines and lighting (consider laser displays too) can add a lot of creepy, mysterious ambiance. And don't forget sound!  Eerie noises, sultry music, whatever fits best."
halloween,3djpiq,BuddhaRocks,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:50:25 2015 UTC,I second this idea about mandatory costumes. Our parties require it.
halloween,3djpiq,prawnfairy,3,Wed Jul 22 01:53:18 2015 UTC,"Do you have any games planned? That really livens up a party. I usually do ""Bobbing for Booze"" at my Halloween parties, which consists of filling a large plastic cauldron up with water and placing several mini bottles of alcohol in it. Each person has to bob until they get one, and then they have to drink whatever they caught. Horror movie trivia is fun too and you could have some good prizes for the winning team.  Another thing that people love: a photo booth. Doesn't have to be an actual booth, but just a set-up with a fun Halloween background and spooky props and a photographer. I've been to a few events that have had this and it was incredibly popular.   Hope you have an awesome party."
halloween,3djpiq,sp00kyscary,2,Fri Jul 17 19:47:27 2015 UTC,... Can I come?  This sounds amazing!
halloween,3djpiq,KnowYourSecret,3,Sun Jul 19 00:24:51 2015 UTC,"This party sounds awesome. If it's in the LA area, I'm coming lol.  Since it's outside, I'm going to assume there will be trees around the area? If so, I would say little touches like sparkly bats and crows placed in the trees would be great. Most people won't notice them right away but when the light hits the sparkles, it'll subtly illuminate the bats/crows as if they're hiding in the shadows, silently watching the guests. Make sure you use highly reflective/sparkly black glitter. If you want, you can mix some silver in there as well but I wouldn't do it solely with silver bc then the subtlety will be gone. You can probably do this with owls too.  If you aren't doing this already, I would suggest putting up string lights throughout but also placing some darker colored, more creepy lights in certain areas. You can tie this in with the idea above to add to the creepiness of the animals in the trees.  Building on the above, I would also add one or two realistic, creepy silhouettes in some of the darker, more isolated areas of the party space. I know you're going for a fun, sexy vibe but I think tying in more unexpectedly creepy components would be really great because if most of the party is centered around a fun, sexy theme, your guests will probably not be expecting creepy or scary decorations, which will probably compound the creepiness factor.  If there will be servers, I feel like having their faces painted like skulls would be cool but only if they're done realistically. OH! Also, the bartenders could dress up at butchers/murderers. I'm talking Dexter style black plastic aprons, that kind of thing."

halloween,3d3ngz,Maxito516,6,Mon Jul 13 06:56:52 2015 UTC,Either would be awesome.  I reckon you should go with what your budget allows and don't half ass it.
halloween,3d3ngz,BanjoPoundHerSome,9,Mon Jul 13 08:25:53 2015 UTC,I reckon you should go with what your budget allows and don't half ass it.   Should be the motto of /r/Halloween!
halloween,3d3ngz,Bauer22,6,Mon Jul 13 12:57:15 2015 UTC,"I went as Rorschach last year and got some good praise for my costume (if you are going to do, definitely get a moving inkblot mask ) but you will be a lot more confortable dressed as Alex and be able to see, eat and drink with out haveing to move the mask."
halloween,3d3ngz,redwalker,4,Mon Jul 13 12:31:50 2015 UTC,Do the mashup thing and try Rorschalex.
halloween,3d3ngz,timmy242,2,Mon Jul 13 15:53:35 2015 UTC,"Good idea.  Mashups are pretty hot lately, and it's a nice way to 'freshen-up' a classic like Alex."

halloween,3crslt,DarkDubzs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:41:09 2015 UTC,The Owl Man really freaks me out for some reason. http://imgur.com/8XJzRyh  I think it's because of the long curled fingers and jet black eyes. It would be a tricky costume to make but I can just imagine someone dressed like that standing in the shadows on the side of a house as Trick-or-Treaters walk by on the sidewalk. Right as someone notices you and does a double take just slip out of sight to really mess with their heads!
halloween,3co6h9,ClarkW_Griswold,5,Thu Jul 9 12:53:08 2015 UTC,"Alright! Lets figure this out.   First off, it works fine on mine, but I have RES installed, so I might be looking at something different. For instance, the ""My Subreddits"" pull down is above the Halloween header, not below it.  It is consistently above the header of other subs as well.   Do you have RES installed?  Is this an issue that's been happening for a while?"
halloween,3co6h9,TheBookWyrm,3,Thu Jul 9 13:00:43 2015 UTC,Yes.  It has happened since I subbed here just before Halloween last year.  I've just never dealt with it.  It happens in one or two other subs as well.  I don't even know what RES is. Figured that part out.. and I can now see all of them.
halloween,3co6h9,Dudecalion,2,Thu Jul 9 13:47:05 2015 UTC,Make sure you make a habit of backing up your RES data. I hate it when they update the plugin and I lose my shortcuts and tags and whatnot. I seem to remember reading this is especially a Firefox problem.
