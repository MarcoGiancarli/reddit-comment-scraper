Our seats were right behind one of the bench doors so when the players exited the ice they would look directly up at us. Best seats ever, I even caught a puck from Kovalev.   After a shift Matthew Barnaby comes off he looks directly up at my girlfriend, looks away quickly trying to dismiss the fact that he made eye contact with her, but as he does he totally made the ""eh I'd fuck her"" face.  I had never been more honored in my life.  But easy Barnaby, she was 17 at the time."

hockey,3e2y91,jmblumenshine,12,Tue Jul 21 17:35:09 2015 UTC,No way in hell Detroit goes back to the Central. If anyone moves back it's Columbus.
hockey,3e2y91,golf4miami,9,Tue Jul 21 16:07:53 2015 UTC,Surprised to see this from a Blackhawks fan. All Blackhawks fans I know want the Det-Chi rivalry back.  Moving Columbus doesn't resolve the issue. The NHL would probably have to move either Det or one of the Florida teams to the Metro. They probably want to keep the Florida teams together which means Detroit goes to the Metro which doesn't make sense since they don't really have any rivalries there. It's just simpler to move Detroit to the Central.
hockey,3e2y91,Sallum,11,Tue Jul 21 16:32:52 2015 UTC,"I want the rivalry back, but there is no way in hell Illitch lets them go back West. It's just not going to happen. They fought for many years to get out of the Central."
hockey,3e2y91,golf4miami,3,Tue Jul 21 16:35:32 2015 UTC,"To put it in perspective for other readers, Detroit is as far east as Tampa Bay."

hockey,3e2y91,PedalBike,11,Tue Jul 21 16:35:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly! If Detroit doesn't go back, just leave the divisions uneven. We've gained a lot of momentum over the last few years and began starting new rivalries. Moving back to the west fucks all of that up."

hockey,3e2y91,Elij17,8,Tue Jul 21 17:48:27 2015 UTC,Yes but Detroit is a bigger team and has an ownership who will put up a bigger fight to stay away from the Central.
hockey,3e2y91,golf4miami,2,Tue Jul 21 16:37:45 2015 UTC,"Also, I hate to be a dick but Detroit was in the west before Columbus was a team. Or fan base is sick of late games"
hockey,3e2y91,blueorcawhale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:46 2015 UTC,"Instead of moving Detroit, the NHL could troll all the balanced-conferences supporters by moving someone like Nashville to the east. It would make the conferences 14-18 but allows divisions to be equal in each conference.  Imagine how vicious the wildcard race would be in the east."
hockey,3e2y91,NaturalBornHypocrite,3,Tue Jul 21 17:34:31 2015 UTC,You have to allow crossovers then. Similar to what is done in the CFL.

hockey,3e2y91,andrewdt10,8,Tue Jul 21 17:40:03 2015 UTC,"I'd be furious if the wings got put back in the west. We did our time. Having at least one series starting at 10 30 every year is fucking brutal. It's easy for every other team in the east to say Detroit can move back when they have never done it, besides Columbus"
hockey,3e2y91,blueorcawhale,4,Tue Jul 21 16:29:39 2015 UTC,There are a couple reasons it wouldnt be all bad.  Renewed Hawks rivalry being one of them.  Also us west coast fans would be able to see more games.  but I totally understand the timezone crap it must be intollerable.

There's no reason why a team can't be successful in Atlanta. The Flames were profitable, but got screwed over by ownership.

hockey,3dzwk2,DonnoWhatImDoing,5,Mon Jul 20 22:31:11 2015 UTC,"From a PR perspective I would assume that when taking a picture that will get thrown up everywhere you likely chose players that define the team and will be there for sometime.  No disrespect to Demers, just his contract ends in a year and this could end being a ""who is that bearded guy next to Benn and why is he in the picture"" type of thing."
hockey,3dzwk2,lockedge,4,Mon Jul 20 22:35:05 2015 UTC,"Given Benn's recent twitter slip, perhaps they added Demers to take advantage of that newfound popularity?"

hockey,3e2ikm,ThisIsTheBlack,100,Tue Jul 21 13:32:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely interesting how this starts after the years where the Penguins last were really successful in the playoffs, includes two Conn Smythe winning performances for Toews & Kane, and probably the worst playoffs for Malkin (14-15) and Crosby (13-14).  When Crosby/Malkin don't score, Penguins lose in 4-5 games. When Toews/Kane don't score more than one goal in the first 20 games of a playoff run, they win the Cup. That's the difference of supporting cast each pair has.  That said, only truly ignorant fans still blame Crosby and Malkin, before injuries, depth, goaltending, defense, management, etc.,  at this point, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯."
hockey,3e2ikm,kikkerlaika,40,Tue Jul 21 13:45:23 2015 UTC,"Judging from the title (The Difference a Supporting Cast Makes) they chose that time frame to make that exact point.   According to the graphic, Crosby and Malkin have been better playoff performers recently than Toews and Kane.  That doesn't stop many people for saying that they aren't performing and yet praising Toews and Kane."
hockey,3e2ikm,twoerd,17,Tue Jul 21 14:34:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's pretty clear that the dude who made that wanted to show that - it's kinda what he explained in other tweets he also posted. But it's worth repeating, probably."
hockey,3e2ikm,kikkerlaika,10,Tue Jul 21 14:36:59 2015 UTC,"... no? The graphic is pointing out that supporting cast has more to do with playoff success than star performance. Which is great for you, since your stars have occasionally really underperformed at crunch time."
hockey,3e2ikm,modicular,6,Tue Jul 21 17:34:59 2015 UTC,"its not beating down Toews/Kane, its praising your GM/supporting cast.

How much staying healthy is luck and how much is skill... I don't really know."

Having enough depth only gets you so far. When you have your depth players taking the spot of your role players for an extended period of time, you can't expect your team to be very successful."

Yeah, this was supposed to show that Crosby/Malkin have performed just as well as Toews/Kane during their ""playoff failure"" years despite the drastic differences in team success.  That's why it excluded our cup runs.  Not intended to put down either group of players in any way.  I don't get how Hawks fans got all defensive with this, if anything it was using their players as the standard by which to judge stars, which should be a compliment."

hockey,3e2ikm,marshalofthemark,5,Tue Jul 21 18:05:17 2015 UTC,"Another factor to consider when comparing players is competition. Defensive rankings for that team in that regular season (i.e. least goals against) in brackets.  Pens - '07 Sens (10th), '08 Sens (24th), '08 Rangers (4th), '08 Flyers (18th), '08 Wings (1st), '09 Flyers (16th), '09 Capitals (19th), '09 Hurricanes (8th), '09 Red Wings (20th), '10 Sens (18th), '10 Habs (13th), '12 Flyers (20th), '13 Isles (21st), '13 Sens (2nd), '13 Bruins (3rd), '14 Jackets (13th), '14 Rangers (4th), '15 Rangers (3rd)  6/18 series against top 5 defences. Crosby: 32 GP, 25 pts; Malkin: 32 GP, 22 pts  4/18 series against 6th-15th ranked defences. Crosby: 22 GP, 23 pts; Malkin: 22 GP, 23 pts  8/18 series against below-median defences. Crosby: 46 GP, 70 pts; Malkin: 47 GP, 66 pts  Hawks - '09 Flames (23rd), '09 Canucks (7th), '09 Wings (20th), '10 Predators (14th), '10 Canucks (12th), '10 Sharks (8th), '10 Flyers (15th), '11 Canucks (1st), '12 Coyotes (5th), '13 Wild (15th), '13 Wings (5th), '13 Kings (8th), '13 Bruins (3rd), '14 Blues (3rd), '14 Wild (7th), '14 Kings (1st), '15 Preds (9th), '15 Wild (6th), '15 Ducks (20th), '15 Lightning (12th).  6/20 series against top 5 defences.

Toews: 18 GP, 16 pts; Kane: 17 GP, 13 pts  (Caveat: it's sort of unfair to lump a team with Zetterberg and Lids in with poor defensive teams - I'm pretty sure that 20th in goals against for the '09 Wings was a fluke. But both the Hawks and the Pens had to play them, so it should skew both sets of stats equally)  Divided thus, it looks like Toews and Kane have fairly similar numbers against all competition, while Crosby and Malkin are much more affected by who they're playing against.  One explanation is that Crosby and Malkin's regular season stats are inflated because they're just lighting up low-quality teams, and they're not all that far ahead of Toews and Kane.  The other explanation is that good defensive teams are able to focus specifically on shutting down 87 and 71 when facing the Pens, but the Hawks have so much depth that the same teams have to spread the attention around, making it easier for 19 and 88 to come through."

hockey,3e2ikm,Fred_Kwan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:22:40 2015 UTC,"Kane is .983 points/game in his playoff career, and Toews is .872/game.  Those aren't the numbers of Crosby and Malkin (1.18 and 1.09), but they aren't 'shadows' compared to anything.  Kane's numbers are good for fifth on the active list, and Toews is 11th. http://www.hockey-reference.com/leaders/points_per_game_active_p.html  edit: plus, because I'm still marveling that your post 'shadows, it's not even close' has upvotes, I'll add that Toews and Kane have played 15 or 16 more playoff games than Crosby and Malkin, which, it's harder to maintain statistics over a longer period of time, plus, those more games come from deeper runs in the playoffs, meaning tougher competition, meaning goals are tougher to come by."
hockey,3e2ikm,IronyHurts,7,Tue Jul 21 15:27:57 2015 UTC,Kane and Toews are great playoff performers.  Crosby and Malkin aren't chokers.  That's what this is supposed to show.  I don't get why Blackhawks fans are getting so upset over it (not directed at you personally).

hockey,3e2ikm,DriArcher,2,Tue Jul 21 18:19:37 2015 UTC,I am not sure you understand how sample size and statistics work.  A single event (a goal) is subject to a variety of factors as the number of events increases (although the sample size needs to be closer to 100 goals than 10) it becomes easier to determine what factors and to what extent they influence the event.  Crosby's and Malkin's regular season statistics and full career of playoff statistics provide enough events to determine their baseline production.
hockey,3e2ikm,Fred_Kwan,2,Tue Jul 21 18:23:40 2015 UTC,"I understand that over the long run, statistics regress to the mean, and that Kane and Toews have had some long runs.  :)  And a goal in the first round of the playoffs counts the same on paper as a goal in the conference finals or the Cup finals, but it's both more difficult, and more valuable to score a goal deeper in the playoffs, rather than early in the playoffs."

hockey,3e2ikm,Buonka,-7,Tue Jul 21 15:56:05 2015 UTC,"No. I'm applying the anti hawk circle-jerk reasoning. 70 point player? pshh. not elite. Intangibles arent a real thing. His defense isnt good because corsi says so. But Beliveau actually strikes me as a good comparison. Great leader, insanely hard working, lots of heart and a team player. He wasnt Lemieux, and he wasnt Gretzky, but damn it if his name isnt on the cup 17 times, and it wasnt by being mediocre or unworthy of his team. PS. The serial downvoting is proof of what im saying. It's relevant to the topic being discussed, but people want to react angrily to anything that suggest that Toews is better than his stats indicate. I think Crosby is WAY better than Toews for the record, but y'all need to get a grip."

hockey,3e2ikm,Fig_Newton_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:09 2015 UTC,"No one is arguing he's the best player in the league, but Hawks fans would like people to give him some credit instead of saying ""Well, he's on a great team"" (as if he's not part of what makes the team great and doesn't make the players around him better) or ""his high in points in a season is 70"" (even though he's better defensively and has more defensive responsibilities than pretty much every forward in the NHL except Bergeron and maybe Kopitar).   At the end of the day, it might not matter too much; he's an elite player and a future Hall of Famer (along with Kane, Crosby, and Malkin). But for some reason, anytime a discussion about Toews comes up, this is the typical response."

hockey,3e2ikm,TweetPoster,2,Tue Jul 21 15:30:24 2015 UTC,"If top-tier players wanted to change their focus from scoring all of those points to playing a defensive game while still putting up 80 points a season, they'd have a much easier time transitioning into that role, while players like Toews aren't capable of scoring those huge numbers because they aren't as gifted offensively.  If you've got the opportunity to shine offensively, you do it.  That's every player's goal.  Toews is a good player, but he's not top-tier."

It's how many points Crosby/Malkin put up in the postseason relative to their own regular season numbers.  One of the obvious reasons that some people think Crosby and Malkin are part of the problem is that both Pens players have consistently had significant dropoffs in point production once the playoffs start, whereas Toews/Kane by comparison see very little change.

hockey,3e2ikm,DriArcher,6,Tue Jul 21 17:27:45 2015 UTC,"How is that the issue or different from what others are saying in this thread? In the playoffs the depth of the Penguins get exposed, and the opposing teams can focus on shutting down the Penguins top players.  Even if you only look at Crosby's career numbers in the playoffs and compare them to other players regular season numbers - the only guy that outperforms him is Malkin. And he is still the best playoff producer (2nd being Malkin, again). So even if you account for those two producing less in the playoffs - they shouldn't be the issue people talk about when discussing the Penguins' problems in the playoffs.  I'm not sure why you got downvoted so much, but I also don't really get the point you wanted to make."
hockey,3e2ikm,ChicagoRunner,0,Tue Jul 21 16:40:27 2015 UTC,"To me, there are two underlying questions at play with the stats that were originally linked:  1) Crosby and Malkin aren't producing enough and that is a reason for the lack of success for the Penguins in the postseason.  2) Crosby and Malkin have reputations for not showing up in the postseason.  As I mentioned to another commenter, I don't believe #1 applies.  The linked stats, yours, and mine all indicate that they're putting up enough points to be comparable with other top 6 forwards experiencing postseason success.  However, I disagree that the 20% dropoff is can be explained away via ""depth"" alone.  Every single team in the NHL has their top guys targeted and focused on in the postseason, Toews and Kane included.  Here's two other duos that I did for comparison.  Corey Perry: .93 PPG RS, .93 PPG PS: 1.0 ratio.  Ryan Getzlaf: .99 PPG RS, 1.15 PPG PS: 1.15 ratio  D Sedin: 1.0 PPG RS, .88 PPG PS: .88 Ratio  H Sedin: 1.02 PPG RS, .92 PPG PS, .90 Ratio  And this brings me to my point, which is #2.  Over the last 6 years Crosby and Malkin have fully earned their reputations for not showing up the in playoffs... because they don't produce up to their potential.  Their dropoff is higher than many other comparable players, and this is why they get the label.  The fact that they aren't producing up to their potential, however, is not the reason for the penguin's team lack of postseason success, regardless of how absurd their numbers were in '09 (1.3 PPG Crosby, 1.5 PPG Malkin)."

hockey,3e2j3y,blazik,4,Tue Jul 21 15:37:14 2015 UTC,"Teams control a player's rights during Restricted Free Agency years so the player has less bargaining power. RFA players can only negotiate with their current teams (the exception is offer sheets but they are rarely used). This helps make younger RFA players cheaper than older UFA players for the same level of production.   Once a player gets old enough they pass into Unrestricted Free Agency and can sign with any team. So now instead of only being able to negotiate with one team, each player can negotiate with 30 teams. This helps drove up the price as there is always a team or 2 willing to overspend on good players."

hockey,3e2j3y,lmHuge,3,Tue Jul 21 15:19:30 2015 UTC,"Because an RFA tender at $4MM sounds too low for you?   For Holtby ya. He has a career .922 SV% and a .936 SV% in the playoffs. And he seems to be improving .    What 25 year old makes more than that?    Not a fair question. Salaries are going up across the board and Holtby is entering his prime years. We're starting to see unprecedented salaries in every category.    Varlamov make $5.9MM but he's no longer on his RFA.   Holtby is better than Varlamov. By a good bit too. And how good a player is, is not the only factor that goes into salary negotiations. There's age, potential, and leverage. In this case Holtby's age is perfect (reaching his prime), seems to be improving (high potential), and the Caps are not a playoff team without him (lots of leverage).   He probably won't get 8m, he'll most likely get 7-7.5m and he's well worth it (IMO). He's a great goalie that shines in the playoffs. If I were the Caps GM I'd actually take the risk and sign him 8m for long term (thank God I'm not a GM and don't have to be responsible for risks)."
hockey,3e2j3y,CaptainBaldy4Hart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:33:35 2015 UTC,"I disagree that the caps aren't a playoff team without him.

Not only that, he's better than Price was when he signed for 6y, 6.5m AAV, and very similar to how good Rask was when he signed a 8y, 7m AAV deal. Holtby definitely has a case for 7.5m/year"
hockey,3e2j3y,Roughly6Owls,4,Tue Jul 21 15:14:03 2015 UTC,"He's still on RFA. That's the key. No arbitrator has or will give that much money. Two year deal, maybe he'll get $6MM. On a one year he's probably looking at $5MM."
hockey,3e2j3y,CassiusTheDog,3,Tue Jul 21 15:17:00 2015 UTC,"So? RFAs typically get paid less than UFAs, but that doesn't mean they don't get paid a ton of money if they're worth it: see Tarasenko for the most recent example.  All of those contracts I just mentioned were signed by RFAs, which mean they're comparable contracts for Holtby's case, and in fact they were all signed by very similar aged players -- an arbitrator can definitely give him that much money."
hockey,3e2j3y,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:24:59 2015 UTC,The difference with Tarasenko's contract is that half of it DOES cover UFA status years. So unless the Caps are planning on going long term then there is no way Holtby should be getting over 6 a year. Tarasenko wouldn't have come close to 7.5AAV if he signed a bridge deal.
hockey,3e2j3y,gruesome2some,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:58:10 2015 UTC,"Sure, and that's an important consideration -- UFA years are typically 40% more expensive than RFA years. However, sometimes that doesn't matter: do you think Tarasenko's contract would've been 4m/year if it was only four years long?  To look at it another way go check out the Kane and Toews last contracts. They were only RFA years, and they made 6.3m/year. If you're worth the money, you get paid the money."
hockey,3e2j3y,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:21:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's true, but 6.3 AAV when there are a couple forwards making over 9 is very different than getting 7 or 7.5 AAV when the highest paid goaltender is only making 8.5 and the second most paid is goalie is nearly a million less than that."
hockey,3e2j3y,gruesome2some,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:31:49 2015 UTC,"Except that the best comparable contract when you consider RFA status and age is Bobrovsky's 7.4m/year. That is... exactly what you're saying is too high. And statistically, Holtby's very firmly in the Rask/Lundqvist range of goaltenders, who are currently looking at north of 7m in compensation if they're proven starters."
hockey,3e2j3y,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:56 2015 UTC,Agree to disagree I suppose.
hockey,3e2j3y,gruesome2some,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:58:00 2015 UTC,Term is definitely a key point there - imo 7.5 is reasonable on a 4 year deal but much too high on a 7 or 8 year deal
hockey,3e2j3y,killerbrand,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:31 2015 UTC,"Sure, but Holtby's arguing for how much he should be paid for his next contract -- the term has already been set."

hockey,3e2j3y,Shanghai1943,4,Tue Jul 21 15:50:40 2015 UTC,"Do you watch Holtby ever?  Comparing Holtby to Hiller or Ramo is sort of like comparing Hudler to Jones. They're both right-wingers, yes, but one of them is amazing at his job, and the other one is basically an average NHLer."

Even for 1M/yr I'm not even sure I'd prefer having Chiass in the lineup over Prince/Puempel or Paul (when he enters the league in a year or two). Dude hasn't been playing to his strengths since the first month of last season, just seems to be a slow turnover machine whenever he's on the ice"

hockey,3e2j3y,RSquared,29,Tue Jul 21 13:40:55 2015 UTC,"Except he's an RFA and this is arbitration - 1 or 2 years.  He's asking for Hank UFA years money.  $7m is defensible, though he should get closer to 6.  $8m is ""let him walk"" money.  What that chart tells me is ""don't overpay on goaltending, ever"".  There are good goalies at every salary band."
hockey,3e2j3y,RSquared,14,Tue Jul 21 14:05:22 2015 UTC,Bobrovskys contract was 7.425 and RFA. Cap has increased since then so % of cap has changed. I'd much rather pay 8 million for Holtby's under 30 years than his over 30 years.
hockey,3e2j3y,IGame4Charity56,7,Tue Jul 21 14:15:33 2015 UTC,"Arb can't use cap escalation as part of his decision.  Bob's salary alone this year is 8.5 which is the only possible comparable that Holtby's side could be using.  And I wouldn't take any goalie for 8m.  Not Hank, not Price, not Holtby.  Goalies today are too good."
hockey,3e2j3y,CROW_NOT_JACKDAW,14,Tue Jul 21 14:17:43 2015 UTC,Id take Price any day of the week for 8 mill.
hockey,3e2j3y,Minnesota_MiracleMan,9,Tue Jul 21 14:25:56 2015 UTC,I'd pay Holtby too. He wont get the full 8 but you pay a premium for elite goaltending.
hockey,3e2j3y,IGame4Charity56,7,Tue Jul 21 14:46:48 2015 UTC,"And the Habs already have problems filling out a team, now he makes that much?"
hockey,3e2j3y,Untoldstory55,3,Tue Jul 21 14:31:42 2015 UTC,8 million would only be an extra 1.5 from what he is making now and I fully expect we will be making moves soon most likely Emelin or Gilbert which would free up cap. Also we dont have any issues filling out a team our only issues are our scoring depth. Plus lets just say that after this deal which ends in 3 years he goes up to 8 million I would expect the cap to go up so that would benefit us as well.
hockey,3e2j3y,IGOR_ULANOV_55_BEST,11,Tue Jul 21 14:37:13 2015 UTC,price is the only goalie worth 8 right now.  and even then it wouldnt be a team friendly contract.
hockey,3e2j3y,Minnesota_MiracleMan,3,Tue Jul 21 15:32:43 2015 UTC,Price at 30 as a UFA is going to command 10+ MM on the open market. If Lundqvist got 8.5MM 2 years ago at 32 there's no way Price goes for less.
hockey,3e2j3y,IGame4Charity56,5,Tue Jul 21 16:08:29 2015 UTC,"And that is an extra $1.5 Million you can't spend on scoring depth.  Yes, in 3 years the Cap will go up. But $8 Million now isn't the same as $8 Million in 3 years. You can plan for Cap increases and contracts not looking as insane. But that doesn't change the fact that $8 Million now is insane."
hockey,3e2j3y,Minnesota_MiracleMan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:17:50 2015 UTC,8 mill now or 8 mill in 3 years regardless id take Pricey for 8 mill any day.
hockey,3e2j3y,Minnesota_MiracleMan,3,Tue Jul 21 15:25:03 2015 UTC,"And I think he's worth it. But have fun building a team around it. Basically, paying too many superstars, especially goaltenders, puts all of your eggs in the basket of drafting well and having guys on their entry level and low RFA deals max out their return. It isn't always the best basket to have your eggs in as it relies on solid drafting, which can be a crap shoot."
hockey,3e2j3y,WeatherFordcaster,7,Tue Jul 21 15:38:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Goalies north of even $7 Million is risky territory.  But beware, /r/hockey loves their goaltenders and a goaltender eating up tons of cap space is a great way to build a team. Because Price, Rinne, Rask, Lundqvist, and Bobrovsky have been SO great at winning Stanley Cups recently.  And before a butthurt Boston fan goes nuts, Tuuka Rask wasn't on a $7 Million Cap Hit when you won the Cup."
hockey,3e2j3y,Minnesota_MiracleMan,14,Tue Jul 21 14:45:38 2015 UTC,Rask didn't even play a playoff game when Boston won.
hockey,3e2j3y,kenata88,4,Tue Jul 21 14:50:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah that too. My point was more on Salary, I didn't event think about it that far."
hockey,3e2j3y,RSquared,4,Tue Jul 21 14:54:04 2015 UTC,"Lundqvist to be fair was a HUGE reason the Rangers made 2 solid runs. It wasn't his fault the Rangers didn't finish, he deserves a bit more credit than you're giving him. Same with Price, he's the ONLY reason the Habs are even relevant with the scoring depth that team has. I'll give you Rask he hasn't done much, and Bobrovski has had a ton of injuries lately so it's hard to judge"
hockey,3e2j3y,kenata88,5,Tue Jul 21 16:30:35 2015 UTC,"Is Lundqvist's salary handicapping the Rangers? I think so.  Can you replace Lundqvist with league-average goaltending and improve NYR to the point they did as well as they did or better? Not sure, I'm leaning no.  But his cut of the salary cap is a big rock in their stream.  The Kings and Hawks have shown that the way to win in a capped league is to get superstars for less than they're worth."
hockey,3e2j3y,gianthamguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:41 2015 UTC,"Well Quick makes $5.8m AAV, and LA and CHI are having cap issues as well. The Rangers get away with it by not having 2 forwards making $10m a year for 8 years, they built their team from the net out instead of the opposite. Not saying either strategy is better but it's a different approach"
hockey,3e2j3y,frimmblethwotch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:42:37 2015 UTC,"Hank is not handicapping us. It's spending $26 million dollars on a blue line that includes Kevin Klein, Dan Girardi, and Dan Boyle (who while not as bad as everyone says, does not deserve 4.5)"
hockey,3e2j3y,RSquared,3,Tue Jul 21 18:56:56 2015 UTC,"Rask took us to the SCF. He had a .985 sv% against the Pens in that series. We very well might have won that cup if Bergeron and Chara hadn't have been injured. I can damn near guarantee that 17 seconds doesn't happen if Bergeron doesn't have broken ribs.  Same deal last year. Was not at all his fault that the Krecji-Lucic-Iginla line decided to disappear against the Habs, and we still took them to 7 games. That series was a goal-tending duel, and goddamn was it close. Carey Price's goalposts were first stars in at least two of their wins.  I think Boston had a much better chance of beating the Kings than the Rangers did, and Rask is a massive part of that."
hockey,3e2j3y,Minnesota_MiracleMan,4,Tue Jul 21 17:37:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure the Canes are having a great time with Cam Ward's 6.7 AAV for the next few years.  For every good goalie making bank, there seems to be one that has dropped off."
hockey,3e2j3y,Tavisss,3,Tue Jul 21 15:19:40 2015 UTC,Don't even get me started on committing longer than 3 or 4 years at the top end money for goalies.
hockey,3e2j3y,Minnesota_MiracleMan,2,Tue Jul 21 15:38:49 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on these points and have been for a while. Like when Winnipeg commited to Pavelec long term at what 4.5? Ridiculous.  I'd rather give a goalie in today's landscape a three year deal at a much higher amount, like 9.5 or 10, than a seven year deal at 7 to 8.  That's pulling numbers out of my ass a bit, but I'm sure you get my point."
hockey,3e2j3y,serfis,2,Tue Jul 21 16:40:12 2015 UTC,"Its pulling numbers out of your ass, and it is quite the hyperbole and extreme, but I agree with your point.  Quick signed to a $5.8 Million contract is somewhat of a steal, until you look at the length of it. Goalies careers can end suddenly. They can randomly fall off. How much of Quick's success is the LA system? Not saying he isn't worth that, but the risk in the long term investment is pretty large.  But your point, I agree with, but it really only depends on how a team is structured. Say you are the Calgary Flames and have the chance to sign Carey Price. With their young talent and cheap contracts for the next 2 or 3 years, they can throw that type of contract at Price. In the Salary Cap world you must overpay in order to get the guys you want as well as to get the top end talent you need. But its how you balance it and apply overpayments. Generally, I would never overpay a Goaltender, but in the right situation, I would. I think the better way to look at it is that you can pay a league average Goalie $4.5 Million, as opposed to $7.5 Million, and take those savings to apply other places."
hockey,3e2j3y,Minnesota_MiracleMan,6,Tue Jul 21 16:59:30 2015 UTC,"Because Price, Rinne, Rask, Lundqvist, and Bobrovsky have been SO great at winning Stanley Cups recently.   Lundqvist has been a huge part in any success we've had for the past decade, which includes 3 ECF and I've SCF appearances.   I could come up with a similar list of highly-paid centers (Giroux, Spezza, Stamkos, H. Sedin, Thornton, and I could go on) and say ""yeah, these players have been SO great at winning Stanley Cups recently"". Those players getting their big payday isn't what prevented their teams from winning the Cup.   If you've got a truly elite, consistent goalie, you can build around that."
hockey,3e2j3y,gianthamguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:04 2015 UTC,"You can build around that, but the most successful teams in the post salary cap world have won Stanley Cups with average goalies or good goalies on Cap friendly deals. The average goaltender in today's NHL is much better than ever before.  It is the same for superstar skaters, but there isn't the same trend in those players consistently losing out like there has been for goaltenders."
hockey,3e2j3y,CharaSmash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:53:15 2015 UTC,"I mean all teams win cups by having great players on cap friendly deals, but that's not sustainable.

hockey,3e2j3y,mbleslie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:01 2015 UTC,"I would guess that TT's 6M hit was probably one of the top goalie salaries for the 2010-2011 season though. We never would have won the cup without him. It does kind of prove a point with not giving goalies crazy long contracts though, since Thomas revealed his insanity during the following year.  EDIT: As an aside, you can't even put a $ value on the shit TT pulled those playoffs. As far as I'm concerned, he deserved his lifetime earnings as a Bruin in the finals alone."

hockey,3e2j3y,iRTK,21,Tue Jul 21 14:03:04 2015 UTC,"His playoff stats are mind blowing, and that is even with being dragged down from getting blown out 5-0 by the Rangers in Game 7 two years ago.  But I still don't want to see him get $7M+."
hockey,3e2j3y,slowdownnn1,14,Tue Jul 21 14:09:45 2015 UTC,I wouldn't want to either.. but I think he deserves a number in that range.  I was one of the guys going WTF!? When I saw that number - and then I looked up his stats and the goalies he compares with. Dude's been good. Real good.
hockey,3e2j3y,GingerDirtyMitts,6,Tue Jul 21 14:14:14 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say what he deserves... goalies are complicated. As good as his stats have been, I'm not sure I'd say he should be in the top-5 paid goalies in the league yet."
hockey,3e2j3y,CROW_NOT_JACKDAW,3,Tue Jul 21 14:23:24 2015 UTC,im with you on he should not be paid in the top 5 range - main reason longevity. Holtby has only been around what two to three seasons?
hockey,3e2j3y,slowdownnn1,5,Tue Jul 21 15:17:07 2015 UTC,He absolutely does. I'd say he is right up there with the big dogs and he deserves to get paid.
hockey,3e2j3y,RSquared,6,Tue Jul 21 14:51:08 2015 UTC,"I guess it just depends on how long you feel a goalie needs to sustain a performance to be considered elite.  I think Holts has performed at an elite level so far, and I'm comfortable with $6.5m AAV (which is still a huge salary). But for me personally, I want to see him maintain this level for a little while before he gets a top-5 payday. $8m would be #2, $7m is #4 in the league I think.  Edit: He just finished his ELC first 2-year RFA deal and has only been the official starter for one full season."
hockey,3e2j3y,MediocreBadGuy23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:55 2015 UTC,"It's funny, because you ""don't pay for past performance"" but anyone who doesn't have the long-term stats yet ""hasn't proved he can sustain them""."
hockey,3e2j3y,slowdownnn1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that he has great numbers but I'd want to see if he could sustain those numbers for a few seasons before giving him 7m+. I'm not saying he won't, and I'm hopeful that he will. But goalies can be really hot one season and be abysmal the next. I don't want to give the guy Lundqvist money after one phenomenal season. Idk. I'm conflicted as hell on this. I think he deserves it if he can keep up his production."
hockey,3e2j3y,MediocreBadGuy23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:19 2015 UTC,"his playoffs are more than one stellar season - he's been unreal in 2 of the 3, and if you conveniently ignore that game-7 blowout, he's been amazing in all of them.  But contracts and arbitration are primarily focused on regular season play (which is what the contracts are paid out for), and I agree - he's only had one truly excellent regular season (although he showed stretches of brilliance plenty of times before this year)."
hockey,3e2j3y,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:08 2015 UTC,It also doesn't help that his worst year was the year of Adam Oates and his supposed changing of Holtby's goalie style. I think I'd honestly be fine with whatever contact he gets. As long as we get him and for a long time.
hockey,3e2j3y,slowdownnn1,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:59 2015 UTC,"I did the numbers earlier: Holtby's better (statistically) in basically every NHL.com category than Price and Bobrovsky were at the same age. Bob got 7.425m/4y, Price got 6.5m/6y. Holtby's worse than Rask at the same age in sv% and GAA, but had a better win percentage and the same shutout percentage with 40 more games, and Holtby was the clear number 1 in Washington instead of a back-up behind Thomas. Rask got 7m/8y.  So if we're looking at comparable contracts, Holtby's got a pretty good case on 7-7.4m for one year."
hockey,3e2j3y,THECapedCaper,2,Tue Jul 21 15:37:58 2015 UTC,"With Rask though if I'm not mistaken he signed that deal after a year of being the starter - he played 36 of the 48 games, with a .929. Also he played more than half the '09-'10 games with a .931.  Also I'm not huge on awards, but the league is, and Bob won a Vezina before he signed that deal.  I'm with you though - I've been banging the ""Holtby is elite"" drum for a long time, and he's on track to be a stellar goalie. He certainly has a case to get big bucks. I also think that the timing is awkward - he only really came into his own this year (not all his fault - Oates), and hasn't been fully established as a top-guy. You'd like to see one more great season before he gets top dollar.  Edit: Rask signed that deal after taking them to the Finals, with a .940 in 22 playoff games."
hockey,3e2j3y,ehr0c,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:29 2015 UTC,How many RFA years does he have left? I'd throw him a bridge deal at 6M and then make him want to get paid.
hockey,3e2j3y,nriney,9,Tue Jul 21 16:52:28 2015 UTC,"So since presumably Holtby is going to be awarded something in the middle of that, is he actually worth ~$6.5M?"
hockey,3e2j3y,rvabikenerd,11,Tue Jul 21 13:39:05 2015 UTC,"I think hes around that, even upwards of 7mil. He was top 7 in pretty much every goalie category during the regular season. Posted a solid .944 save % in this years playoffs. Hes entering his prime, and a goalie posting those numbers in his prime should probably be getting around 7mil."

hockey,3e2j3y,irishguy42,3,Tue Jul 21 16:01:43 2015 UTC,"I think Holtby is worth $6.5M, but the team was really hoping to lock him down long term at like $5.5M.

I do think Holtby has a great shot at being elite for a long time - but you can't really go up from his recent playoffs.

hockey,3e2j3y,Roughly6Owls,3,Tue Jul 21 14:08:27 2015 UTC,"He has to defend it, and the only comparable he can possibly post is Bob's contract on salary alone, 8.5m this year (which is terrible, though I'm not sure that they can say to the arbitrator ""one GM being an idiot doesn't mean you have to be"").  Carey Price/Bryz are the most likely comparables (remember, RFA contracts only), which puts Holtby solidly in the $6m range."
hockey,3e2j3y,RSquared,10,Tue Jul 21 14:14:31 2015 UTC,"I actually really like Bobrovsky's contract, though I do think it's a little expensive -- I don't like the way NHL teams lock goalies up to max term contracts.  Anyway, Holtby's at a career .921 sv%, 2.44 GAA, and he's won 56% of the games in his career. He has 20 career shutouts, more than one out of every ten games (11.2%).  With that in mind:   Bobrovsky just signed a 4y, 7.425m AAV deal. He's 26, so he signed it as an RFA and I think it counts as a comparable because of that, even though it has three UFA years in it. He's got a career .918sv%, 2.56GAA, and a 54% win percentage (admittedly, on a worse team). He has 11 career shutouts, which is 4.7% of his games. Price signed a 6y, 6.5m AAV contract in 2012 -- again, signed as an RFA, even though it takes him into UFA years. In 2012, he had a .915sv%, a 2.58 GAA, and a 49% win percentage. He had 16 career shutouts, 5.9% of his games. Rask signed a 8y, 7m AAV deal at 26. At the time, he had a career .926sv%, a 2.39 GAA, a 47% win percentage, and 16 shutouts (11% of his games).   Holtby sure as hell looks better than the first two players, and he has more games (and as a starter, instead of behind Thomas) than Rask did. Rask was making about 10% of the cap when he was signed.  As you mentioned though, every other highly paid goalie isn't comparable -- Schneider, Bishop, Lundqvist all had bridge deals until their age 27 season.  That means Holtby's basically trying to convince the arbitrator that he's worth more than Bob or Price, about the same as Rask, and that he's the most important player to the Capitals other than Ovechkin. That being said... he's got good stats to fall back on. Since the lock-out he has more shutouts than anyone except Price and is on the top-ten list for basically any stat if you limit it to guys who've played more than 100 games (that is, been the starter for more than half of the games in each season including the short one)."
hockey,3e2j3y,Roughly6Owls,4,Tue Jul 21 14:52:19 2015 UTC,"Good analysis.  I wouldn't mind signing to Price's contract, honestly.  Getting four UFA years takes us to where we know what we have in Samsonov, Grubauer, and Vanacek.  Bob had a Vezina when he got paid.  Rask bought up a ton of UFA years.    I'm kind of amazed at the number thrown out because I think Bob/Rask is the ceiling for comparables, and they are nowhere near $8 AAV.  I have to believe the other reports that they're looking at a long-term deal between 6 and 7."
hockey,3e2j3y,klabob,4,Tue Jul 21 15:16:18 2015 UTC,"Like I said originally, I doubt Holtby's expecting 8 next season -- if he knew the arbitrator would go with his number, I expect he'd ask for around 7m. His agent just knows the arbitrator will be giving him lower than what he's asked for.  This arbitration case has the potential to go real low though -- the number of good or even mediocre goalies who sign low-value RFA contracts because they're stuck behind established guys (Schneider with Luongo, Andersen with Hiller) until they're 28 is way larger than the number who become starters as early as Holtby has."

hockey,3e2j3y,mantiseye,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:54 2015 UTC,"Bobrovsky, Price and Varlamov are the likely comparables.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2015/07/13/why-taking-braden-holtby-to-arbitration-could-cost-the-caps-dearly/?postshare=4611436796326543"

hockey,3e2j3y,domaa,7,Tue Jul 21 14:22:52 2015 UTC,He sets the ceiling and the team sets the floor and the arbitrator sets the price tag in between.  Since they are $3m apart I think it is reasonable to assume that the arbitrator will split the difference and Holtby will have a $6.5m cap hit (which is in the area I think he deserves).  Him saying that he wants $8m (and the Caps offering him $5m) is just standard negotiating tactics.

hockey,3e2j3y,KlownFace,9,Tue Jul 21 14:17:51 2015 UTC,"Flower : 2.32 GAA , .920 SV% 10 shut outs. Playoffs: 2.12 GAA, .927 SV%  Holtby : 2.22 GAA, .923 SV% 9 shut outs. Playoffs : 1.74 GAA, .944 SV%, 1 shut out  Like I said , their stats are similar, except holtby was better in the playoffs. But I'm willing to bet that if Holtby played behind lovejoy Martin scuderi Cole and two AHL players, his numbers wouldn't be as good.  He doesn't deserve 7.5 or 8 million."
hockey,3e2j3y,DriArcher,-4,Tue Jul 21 14:36:04 2015 UTC,"Did you look at any other stats like holtby playing 70 something games which if I'm not wrong is the most by any starter, he was also in top 3 for shots taken in playoffs and regular season. And his wins which were 41 to MAFs 34. Holtby was too 5 in every league leading category except sa% which he was in 6th and MAF was first in shutouts and 10th in wins"
hockey,3e2j3y,KlownFace,9,Tue Jul 21 14:49:46 2015 UTC,Wins is a team stat.  I never said fleury was better than holtby. I simply said their stats are similar and he isn't worth that much money.
hockey,3e2j3y,The_Other_Manning,-3,Tue Jul 21 14:51:18 2015 UTC,Wins count for the team first and foremost but it's definitely a goalie stat go look on NHL it's always a goalie stat.  Teams play more or less confidently with certain goalies behind them which does account for worth and clearly the caps play better when Holtby holds it down. Besides his playoffs stats were unreal you posted them I mean cmon the reason I say playoffs is for MAFs incredible inconsistency in post season which is important arguably more important.
hockey,3e2j3y,KlownFace,4,Tue Jul 21 14:59:18 2015 UTC,Wins are not a stat that should be used to compare goalies. Wins are completely a team stat.

hockey,3e3cn2,WingsFan4Life,4,Tue Jul 21 17:47:07 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity...   Wings fans, what would it take for you guys to trade Pulkkinen or Jurco? Also, would you say they're sort of the lower equivalent to Nyquist and Tatar? If not, who would you compare them too?"
hockey,3e3cn2,AshytooClassy,6,Tue Jul 21 18:16:22 2015 UTC,"Everyone's opinion varies, but I'll give you mine:   Jurco - Worth more in potential than he has shown to be worth on the ice.  22 years old, 99 nhl games played, big body (something we kind of lack) and deserves a fighting chance on a scoring line with capable teammates Pulkkinen - So hot right now.  23 years old, didn't look good in his 30 something NHL games last season, probably has a higher trade value due to his monster AHL season.. RHS (which we lack).  Will probably be a career 3rd line scoring winger and pp specialist.    Who would I trade first?   Pulkkinen because of the higher value right now... but I'm not sure what I'd want for him..it'd probably be in a package for a top tier defensemen   Who would I compare them to?  Hard to say   Jurco really worked on his 2-way game (the red wing way) this past season and has 'the next Abdelkader' written all over him, if he can get a little more physical Pulkkinen has like a brett hull-esque feel (maybe it's just the slap shot) but I can't really compare him to anyone on the team right now because he's pretty different."
hockey,3e3cn2,congenital_derpes,3,Tue Jul 21 18:21:59 2015 UTC,"Jurco has more raw talent than Abby, which is nice."
hockey,3e3cn2,_iAmCanadian_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:54 2015 UTC,"I think the ""next abdelkader"" is a big slight to Jurco. He is probably my favorite player of the Goose, Tatar, Sheahan, Pulk group, just stuck in a shitty place with Babs last year"
hockey,3e3cn2,Caboose119z,2,Tue Jul 21 18:58:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know what it would take...  I'd put Jurco in the lower end range of Nyquist and Tater. I don't see the Wings being offered anything for him that would make the trade worthwhile.   Pulkkinen, on the other hand, I think he has a lot more potential. If he can learn the speed and flow of the NHL game, and thus translate his ability to find open space to the pro level, he could be dangerous. There have been folks comparing him to a young Brett Hull. And remember, it took Hull awhile to really develop into an effective NHL player, he was in his mid-twenties. Now, I'm not saying he's Brett Hull, but he has that shifty sniper play in him, and a wicked shot. I could see him being a top 6 winger for us in the next year or two, easily. It would take a lot to make me willing to give up the chance of seeing how he develops."
hockey,3e3cn2,DRW1421,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:26:05 2015 UTC,"Jurco is 6'2, defensively sound, and is as skilled as any player in the league. (okay that's a bit exaggerated). He had a stockhandling bid on YouTube go viral, which is what got his name out there. He's only 22 and has scored 33 pts in 99 NHL games, despite playing on the 4th line for most of the year last season. He has, imo, a much higher potential than nyquist and Tatar, and probably higher than anyone else in our prospect pool not named Larkin or Mantha. I think his upper limit would be a hossa esque player.  Pulkkinen is a bit small, his hands are nothing special, and he isn't exactly speedy. But he has a heck of a shot and he likes to shoot. I could see him being a career 3rd liner, but also a power play specialist with his shot. Set up 1 timers for him and he will score."
hockey,3e3cn2,flashin_leather,2,Tue Jul 21 18:41:26 2015 UTC,"Wow, he signed for peanuts. $750K. Jurco will probably get $1.2M then."

hockey,3e2o8f,InternationalCow,9,Tue Jul 21 14:42:22 2015 UTC,He will actually deserve the 8MM as he gets closer to UFA years and our cap situation fixes itself.

hockey,3e2o8f,Roughly6Owls,20,Tue Jul 21 14:51:56 2015 UTC,"Really surprised they don't want to lock him up long term. He's past the point where he needs to do a ""show-me"" contract in my opinion and they could get 3-4 years of UFA covered now I believe."
hockey,3e2o8f,slivr33,14,Tue Jul 21 14:49:00 2015 UTC,"They were trying to, but we don't have the cap space (with Mojo also a UFA) to give him 6+MM a season right now.  Well, we do but it would cost us more than paying him now and paying more later"
hockey,3e2o8f,burrheadjr,4,Tue Jul 21 14:50:01 2015 UTC,"I don't see what the problem is. There's $10.3m in cap space and as far as I can tell there are no roster spots that need to be filled besides MoJo and Holtby. Wouldn't $3.5m and $6.8m AAV be an acceptable offer to both?  Plus, most of your big contracts you probably want to shed have two years left, so how does signing Holtby to a one-year deal help?  Honest questions; I'm not familiar with the Caps' situation."
hockey,3e2o8f,twicetwotimes,10,Tue Jul 21 15:03:49 2015 UTC,But you don't want to be right against the cap -- it restricts trading flexibility and can cause big issues if someone's injured and you need to pay replacements (Chicago went into the playoffs with Kane on LTIR -- when he came back they were actually over-cap. If he'd come back during the season there would've been cap penalties).

hockey,3e2o8f,perogies,5,Tue Jul 21 16:02:45 2015 UTC,It was said during negotiations that the Caps were offering 5.5 and he wanted 6.5.  The 8 million is just a starting point and there is no way that Holtby expects to get it.
hockey,3e2o8f,ChocolateAlmondFudge,3,Tue Jul 21 16:17:47 2015 UTC,The players toss a high pitch when arbitration negotiations begin so that the middle ground is what they actually want.
hockey,3e2o8f,perogies,9,Tue Jul 21 16:22:08 2015 UTC,The Caps do want to lock him up long term but they haven't been able to agree on the price.
hockey,3e2o8f,vliegs,6,Tue Jul 21 15:16:50 2015 UTC,Teams don't want to sign goalies to massive bloated contracts anymore.  See Vancouver/Luongo.
hockey,3e2o8f,blu333,3,Tue Jul 21 15:54:03 2015 UTC,"The market is moving away from that tendency, but there are a lot of teams willing to give large dollar contracts to great / elite netminders who are going to be a workhorse. Schneider at 7 x $6m starting this year is a great example.  Of course, I will grant that players like Bishop, Mason, Varlamov, Fleury, etc. have only been inking 2-4 year deals these past two summers. So it wouldn't be unprecedented to give Holtby at most 4 years.  But Holtby is the youngest of the up-and-coming crowd so he wouldn't be as risky as some other candidates. A full length contract only takes him to 33, which isn't usually a bad age for a goalie."
hockey,3e2o8f,THECapedCaper,3,Tue Jul 21 16:33:38 2015 UTC,"Well Holtby apparently wants $8 million per year, for how many years i don't know, but is he worth that?  I don't know, maybe.  He's not a better goalie than Schneider, he's just on a better team.  $6 million for a long term seems a lot more reasonable... And movable if he drops off later in the contract which goalies have a tendency to do."
hockey,3e2o8f,Fig_Newton_,4,Tue Jul 21 16:37:42 2015 UTC,"Starting with a high asking price is just a negotiation tactic. His actual targeted salary is somewhere between $8m and the $5.25m the Caps offered.  I personally think Holtby is worth $6.5m - $7.5m. He impressed me as far back as the 2012 playoffs against the Rangers and Bruins (when he was still a 21-year old rookie). And he's only 25 so he not only has room to get better, but he's not as likely to drop off at the end of his contract. Schneider, comparatively, is starting a 7-year deal at 29 years old. We're likely seeing him at his peak now and that cap hit might be pretty painful when he's 35 and playing like it.  But don't get me wrong, I really like Schneider, too. I think it's a shame he didn't get any recognition for keeping the Devils out of 28th/29th in the standings."
hockey,3e2o8f,Fig_Newton_,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah i remember that 2012 series well.  Had a feeling he'd be around for a while.  Scheids was rock solid for us in Vancouver too, albeit as a backup."

He only played in 12 more NHL games in his career.  I cant think of a single Dman.  After a ton of looking for a Dman I came up with Norm McIver: 92-93 Senators: 17 goals 63 points.

hockey,3e33vi,BrianWilsonsBed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:31 2015 UTC,"I actually did consider him, but he really only had a flukey year in goal scoring. He scored 56 points, then 73 points (31 goal year), then 76 points.  He missed half of the next season but was still putting up a point per game. The season after that he had a torn groin and missed even more games.   So it really wasn't a fluke he was playing consistently at that level till his body broke down.  He missed about 36% of the possible NHL games since the first major injury."

hockey,3e33vi,hoopopotamus,4,Tue Jul 21 18:51:29 2015 UTC,"Nazem Kadri's 2012-13 season was a fluke, in my opinion. He went 18-26-44 in 48 GP despite playing 2C / 3C minutes (16:03 ATOI). His Sh% was 16.8, which is well above his career average (12.5%) and he boasted an 5v5 PDO of 108.2%, which is among the top 10 for the past 10 years. Also, his 5v5 P/60 (3.4) was double that of his next best seasons (1.7 in 2013-14 and 2014-15). I think that will stand as his career year, even if he gets to play 1C with some good talent on his wings.  On the other end of the spectrum is Nino Niederreiter's 2011-12 season. He went 1-0-1 in 55 GP for the Islanders, which helped lead up to his trade to Minnesota. His 5v5 PDO of 90.4 is one of the worst posted in the last 10 years. Not only was his personal shooting percentage very low (1.4% vs. a career 10.6%), but his line mates weren't getting anything done either (5v5 on-ice Sh% was 0.8%). He has rebounded pretty well with Minnesota and set career highs of 24 goals and 37 points last year at only 22 years old."
hockey,3e33vi,sjgoglin,12,Tue Jul 21 16:45:40 2015 UTC,I don't think Kadri's season was a fluke so much as it was he was playing in the AHL during the lockout & was already at game speed when the NHL returned. Same reason guys like Mark Fraser & Matt Frattin looked pretty decent that season too.

Overall: he revolutionized goal tending with his mobile style. He was controlled chaos and a fierce competitor. Won a vezina.

Those guys have tried to get arenas built for years."
hockey,3e2xod,StatGAF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:59:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that is only in regards to this specific process. Seattle can come along in a year or so after this evaluation process is complete and still get a franchise. Not the preferred or best way, and Quebec and Vegas have a serious leg up on the competition, but this doesn't exclude any other cities going the ""traditional"" route of trying to get an expansion team."
hockey,3e2xod,Minnesota_MiracleMan,8,Tue Jul 21 15:47:09 2015 UTC,"This was a definite ""Put up or Shut up"" move by the NHL.  That statement by the NHL says as much...  They had 16 expressions of interest and in order to figure out who was actually serious... they created this system."
hockey,3e2xod,Todrick,2,Tue Jul 21 16:01:40 2015 UTC,"If someone is serious, in say 2 years, are they barred from getting a team? Never once did Bettman ever say that this process was the only way to get an expansion team and never once did he say that this guarantees anything in terms of getting an expansion team. There is no ""only two teams will be added"" standard.  Seattle may be out for this process. But this process is only going to last another year. Seattle isn't out forever. They aren't out for the foreseeable future. Just for this process. Which may grant 0 expansion teams."

And I suspect Quebec, unless there is some sort of major problem with the Arena(I don't know the situation there) or ownership, Will get theirs.  That put's the League at 32 teams, the Ideal number for 2 Conferences, 4 Divisions.  At that point Seattle may get a team down the road when they have an arena... But it will likely be Florida, or some other floundering relocation."

hockey,3e2xod,Javs42,5,Tue Jul 21 15:37:24 2015 UTC,"None of this confirms that either Vegas or Quebec will get teams and none of this confirms that Seattle, Toronto, Hamilton, Kansas City, Houston, or Portland are ""out"" for NHL expansion in the near future.  Gary Bettman made sure to say over and over again in his press conference that none of this secures anything, and may be all for naught. At worst, with no teams granted, it is a formal way for Vegas and Quebec to present their cases for secure ownership, an up to date arena, viability, and growth to the NHL and it's current owners. Everyone likes to shit on Bettman, especially about Vegas, but this is him giving Quebecor the best possible chance at convincing Owners to expand to Quebec and grant them a franchise.  My overall point: If you want an expansion team, this is your best shot at getting it. But there is no ""if you didn't meet this deadline, no Expansion team for your city for 20 years"". If Seattle figures shit out they will go at the expansion process the same way they would have without this formal application process.  Also, shit on Bettman all you want, but this is him opening the door to Quebec and giving them as good of a shot as they can imagine."

That means he doesn't go to Detroit, and earlier Hartford. That means Pronger never leaves Hartford and potentially is one the early Hurricanes roster. Gonchar wouldn't have been drafted by the Capitals, which means he never would have been traded by them; in the haul for the Caps they received a 1st round pick they used on Varlamov. Caps traded Varlamov for 1st (& 2nd) round pick the former they used to select Filip Forsberg.  The butterfly effect of the whole situation just blows my mind. It changed NHL history"
hockey,3e34k2,everyyearis03,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:52:19 2015 UTC,Pronger would have been moved regardless. Hartford would of loved two or more players for Pronger instead of helping him develop.

The way I read it the NHL would allow a disaster draft if 5 players are involved in an accident where four of them lose their lives and the fifth has his knees shattered, leaving him permanently unable to play, while the NBA wouldn't as the fifth player didn't actually lose a limb.

hockey,3dxwmg,jonsayer,12,Mon Jul 20 14:11:38 2015 UTC,"My understanding was they get to draft anyone they want, with a limited budget with which to compensate affected teams. Then, once they have at least 14 skaters and 1 goalie, they get to pick from the bottom half of the roster of teams they haven't drafted from yet."
hockey,3dxwmg,Lndbrghwrstlr,7,Mon Jul 20 14:43:53 2015 UTC,"So like they could straight up take the prospected 1-14 picks for the next year's draft, and then select from teams..?"
hockey,3dxwmg,YouVersusTheSea,17,Mon Jul 20 15:03:13 2015 UTC,"They can draft anyone they want with a limited budget to compensate the other teams with if they have come to agreeable terms with that team. So... if some team want Crosby, the Penguins would have to work out a deal and give them permission to take him. Then, they get to pick one player from every team that hasn't sold a player in an agreed upon deal until they have the required roster number. It's not necessarily the bottom half of the roster, though. The teams get to protect 10 players and 1 goalie from their clubs AND development teams. Rookies in the NHL and first year prospects in the AHL are off limits. Players under 20 are off limits. The players chosen have to match the position of the player lost, as well. They pay those team $1m each in compensation.       And no, they couldn't take the prospected 1-14 picks for the next year's drafts because prospects aren't signed to teams yet, so they wouldn't be eligible to be chosen. They also wouldn't be able to take the top 14 picks from the previous draft yet because those players are likely within the 1st year professional or under age 20 exemption categories."
hockey,3dxwmg,Lndbrghwrstlr,3,Mon Jul 20 16:23:08 2015 UTC,"If the other teams have to come to agreeable terms to give their player away, why would they ever want to do it?"
hockey,3dxwmg,YouVersusTheSea,9,Mon Jul 20 17:15:30 2015 UTC,"You're misunderstanding this.      They aren't agreeing to ""give their player away."" Each team has to have a $20m life insurance policy on their team to be used only in the case of an event like this. If the entire team wasn't killed, and say... only 5 people were, the team can offer other teams money up to the $20m total insurance policy fund to acquire players.       If no teams agree to do that, they go through the drafting thing and each team gets $1m for each player that ultimately gets taken.       So... if a team can't limit down it's protected list to include all the guys they don't want to risk losing, they might negotiate with the other team to sell off a player for ""market value,"" rather than risking losing him for only $1m."

hockey,3dxwmg,YouVersusTheSea,10,Mon Jul 20 13:33:24 2015 UTC,"I could absolutely see that having triggered the NHL or even any of the other leagues to review their policies, however it does largely depend on how much they had kept them up to date over the years. While the Lokomotiv crash stands out to hockey fans and outside of hockey as well as it involved a significant number of deaths and quite a few very high profile names which made it bigger international news, these sort of events are unfortunately not quite as uncommon as many of us might think.   Wikipedia actually has an entire page listing accidents involving the injury or death of multiple members of sports teams. There has been an average of 3.25 aviation related team accidents per decade listed there going back to the 1940s and the Lokomotiv incident was 20th of 27 listed for total fatalities so there have certainly been other situations that would have warranted a review of these policies. That said, the Yaroslavl crash was the deadliest since 1989 so I would still think that it is likely to have triggered some review of policies, more so even than some other incidents to have occurred in the years prior, but I would hope that the leagues would review every such incident to see if anything can be learned from them, both on the side of increasing safety in the first place and dealing with the tragedy in the aftermath."

hockey,3dxwmg,YouVersusTheSea,13,Mon Jul 20 14:47:11 2015 UTC,"The NFL is technically the only American sports league that grants the commissioner ability to cancel a team's entire season in the event of a tragedy like this.       The plan is covered under section 16C of the NHL Bylaws. It's called the Emergency Rehabilitation Plan and basically says that each team is mandated to carry a life insurance policy of $1 million for each player. In the event of a catastrophe, the team would be allowed to talk to other teams about purchasing players under contract using the insurance money from the players' deaths. If the team is not able to fix roster with the available insurance money, the league holds a special emergency draft. Each of the remaining teams can protect one goalie and ten players from its player development and club playing roster. Rookies are off limits. No more than one player can be be drafted from a team. Each player selected costs the affected team $1 million."

hockey,3dxwmg,HelperBot_,4,Mon Jul 20 15:06:11 2015 UTC,"There is a process. The Board of Governors has to sit down in a meeting and evaluate the team's situation right from the beginning. If there was an accident that wiped out an entire team, they likely would  hold a vote and vote to allow them to cancel their season. But, if there was a bus crash or something and only like 6 players died, the presumption in the bylaws is that the team will continue its season as scheduled."
hockey,3dxwmg,weaselbag,6,Mon Jul 20 15:52:35 2015 UTC,"A vote to cancel one team's season would necessitate a complete rework of the schedule, change of travel plans, hotels, loss of employment for local team staff, lease concerns, etc.  It could happen, but for the sake of continuity, it would be easier to hold an emergency draft and resume the season, callous as that may seem on the surface."

hockey,3dz0p2,TheKert,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:28:06 2015 UTC,"That whole cramps ridicule toward LeBron is so stupid. You physically cannot play when you cramp up like that. There is no ""just tape it up and get back out there"". Cramps suck."
hockey,3dz0p2,WiscDC,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah that whole meme if just a mess. And it's more than just what I've mentioned earlier with it often being harmful for the player long term to play injured, or what you've said about it being physically impossible to play when you can't stand up.  If you are seriously injured, or even just in significant pain like with serious cramps, you are more than likely a detriment to your team out there, no matter how good you are. Everyone loves to see the guy come back from injury and score the big goal, it's a great story, but it's exceedingly uncommon and it's much more likely that by refusing to sit on the bench or leave the game to recover, that you are taking a spot away from someone else who would be more beneficial out there.   Unless you're a true top player in the league where your skills so far exceed any available replacement that an injury just brings you closer to the level of those regular mortals, the gap between players on a pro roster isn't generally large enough that an injured player will be bigger asset in the game than whoever might get bumped up in the lineup to replace them. Getting the big goal or basket or whatever while playing through a significant injury is not just overcoming the pain, it's overcoming the incredible odds against you doing so. It's a great feel good story (minus the potential long term damage) but it's not smart on a team level to reduce your odds to win.   I expect (or hope rather) that as statistical analysis gets more and more use in the NHL and sports in general, that we'll start to see less and less of players playing through noticeable injuries as we go forward. It's going to take time as it's a complicated issue to try to measure, you can't measure the difference nearly as easily and say seeing how player X performs with and without player Y on the ice. That's a very black and white situation, whenever player X is on the ice it's a simple yes or no as to whether player Y is out there as well. However, it's not nearly as easy to identify when a player is playing hurt, and even tougher to try to account for the degree of injury in any sort of weighting.  Hopefully once wearable tech starts to make it's way to the league we'll have some better ability to do that. It still would be far from perfect but a good place to start would be, over the course of a season, analyzing things like a player's average skating speed and then looking for anomalies such as full games where they were well below their normal for the majority of the game. If you can start to isolate individual games, or periods, where the motion data makes it quite obvious that there is a problem, you can start to generate a reasonable pool of data from which to work with.  I have to admit after all of that, my whole point of playing injured being a detriment as a whole is largely speculation since we don't have that data from above. I've seen some write ups on it before and there is some data out there to support it (I'm not sure where to find it now to post) but it is going to be of somewhat questionable value due to the limitations on both the quantity and the accuracy of the data. That said, what really gets me is how that is not the default thought process. It seems like it is completely obvious that you are going to be limited in performance if you are hurt and personally I'm of the mindset that I am going to assume you can't outperform a healthy teammates while hurt unless you prove otherwise. I don't understand why so many people take the opposite approach. Yes, sometimes someone becomes a hero doing something you wouldn't think possible, but that's just it, you wouldn't think it's possible, because you barely ever see it, and then this one time it happens and it's like magic. Why would you possibly think that hoping for miracle seems like the best course of action over putting yourself in a position where you don't need a miracle?"
hockey,3dz0p2,New_Slurm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:13 2015 UTC,"Also, a large percentage of that stuff involved fans saying Michael Jordan played with a fever. They forgot to mention that Michael Jordan missed time in the playoffs because of leg cramps. You know, because his legs didn't work when they cramped up either.  Edit: This also reminds me of how I've seen (not for a long time, thankfully) people make fun of baseball pitchers who can't play because one of their fingers is sprained or broken. Yeah, it's just one finger, but it dramatically affects his ability to play."

He had the awareness to be ready, not saying he could think the game on Lemieux's level, but he wasn't far off. Wasn't like that was Troy Loney or Jay Caufield finishing that chance (and, if it was, Mario probably realizes that and adjusts accordingly to take it himself)."

He recorded a grand total of 0 points. How one of those guys didn't accidentally hit a puck off of him and into the net or picked up the puck off of a line change and scored or something, I'll never know."

hockey,3dyvx1,arseniq33,95,Mon Jul 20 17:46:51 2015 UTC,"Lots of them actually switched to other teams. Like the Bruins... It really was, for some of them, an anything-but-the-Habs situation."
hockey,3dyvx1,slanifrenchie,7,Mon Jul 20 17:48:14 2015 UTC,"It still is.  Anecdote time: I work at a low-priced electronics store in Quebec City. We sell those Canadiens-badged headphones that are frankly not bad compared to what else we sell. Well, despite them being 33% off for a month during the playoffs, we have sold maybe 10 of them. The general reaction when offering them to people was ""Ugh, not the Habs"". So the ""Anything but Canadiens"" (ABC) mentality is still very prevalent here."
hockey,3dyvx1,Brunovitch,25,Tue Jul 21 06:23:20 2015 UTC,"Or would that kind of thing be heavily frowned upon?   Yes.  Im one of the few to have really made the switch.  Many fans in Québec will follow hockey in general and Habs a little more since most coverage in french is about them, but not a lot have made the swtich to ""habs fans""  a lot of them still live in the darkness!"
hockey,3dyvx1,artvandelay1994,13,Mon Jul 20 18:35:46 2015 UTC,That's crazy. I can't imagine a place that loves hockey so much just stop watching altogether. Are the differences between Montreal and QC so drastic that it wouldn't feel right to switch?
hockey,3dyvx1,Brunovitch,34,Mon Jul 20 18:56:56 2015 UTC,"Québec hate Montréal since Montréal was founded.  Its way bigger than hockey.  It's way bigger than any hockey rivalry.  If you think Boston and Montréal hates each other, this was nothing compre to the Nordiques.  Québec is the capital and it was also suppose to be the ""centre"" of Québec.  But, fast, Montréal took over the province.  Also, after to conquest, Montréal become the ""bastion"" of anglos in the province anmd Québec stayed mostly franco.  Most of the provinve always perceived Montréal as an Anglo ""chateau-fort"" in the middle of this french province.  The root of the hatred is really profound.     Since the lost of the Nordiques, thing got a bit more calm, and I don't beleive the hatred will become as fierce as before (habs did all they could to block the Nordiques to join the NHL the first time around, also fuelling the rivalry)  and now Habs supposevly work to help bring back hockey in Québec City, since it's actually good for business.  But, Québec City still have many radio and radio host (trash radio) dedicated to hate montréal."
hockey,3dyvx1,suredont,34,Mon Jul 20 19:05:19 2015 UTC,"A few years ago I was travelling in rural Greece and I came across a pair of middle-aged women outside a cafe speaking that unmistakable patois of Quebec French. Happy to encounter a fellow Canadian in the middle of nowhere, I went up to them and said ""Excuse me, are you from Québec?""   One of them looked me up and down, stuck her nose in the air, and said in the haughtiest tone you can imagine - ""Non. Montréal.""  So that about sums up the relationship between the two cities.  Also, fuck you lady."
hockey,3dyvx1,Brunovitch,6,Mon Jul 20 20:07:19 2015 UTC,"lol.  also, not that in french, we don't say Québec city.  we refer to province and city by just saying Québec.  So, will you might have been talking about the Province, they would think it was the city, so, that explain the hate.  hehe"
hockey,3dyvx1,ThePare,15,Mon Jul 20 21:06:21 2015 UTC,Why do I always feel responsible when a Quebecois acts like a douche to outsiders? Fuck you lady for giving us a bad rep :(
hockey,3dyvx1,suredont,3,Mon Jul 20 21:38:47 2015 UTC,"Aw, it's okay. So many of you guys are amazing. I know she's an outlier. And believe me, she laid alllllll around the out.   haha fat joke."
hockey,3dyvx1,suredont,3,Mon Jul 20 22:04:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know for sure; I've spent a lot of time in the province. I realized my ""mistake"" about 20 seconds after. That said, she read my comment into inter-city aggression instantly, so qu'est ce que fuck lady."
hockey,3dyvx1,Brunovitch,2,Mon Jul 20 22:01:49 2015 UTC,"Ah, yes.  Good old us hating each other and everyone else."
hockey,3dyvx1,artvandelay1994,5,Tue Jul 21 01:25:33 2015 UTC,"Huh, TIL... that is unfortunate for QC. Hope hockey returns to the city soon."
hockey,3dyvx1,MikeyTupper,5,Mon Jul 20 19:08:08 2015 UTC,"Let's put it this way: Quebec City hates Montreal, but in Montreal we don't really hate Quebec City. It just stems from a severe inferiority complex. Montreal is bigger and that seems to tick them off for some reason."
hockey,3dyvx1,kurtilingus,4,Mon Jul 20 20:16:05 2015 UTC,"Ahh, now this is a metaphor I can understand. Sounds very Dallas vs Houston/Cowboys vs Texans. I can assure you your indifference of QC most assuredly keeps the flame of hatred alive for them. Even worse is when you half-heartedly give some encouragement due to province/state loyalty. ""Hey, you guys made the playoffs? Good for you!"" and then proceed to not watch any of the game(s)."
hockey,3dyvx1,Hoof_Hearted12,2,Mon Jul 20 22:50:12 2015 UTC,"My feeling is that montrealers don't care enough about it to hate Quebec city. My feelings about QC are ""meh"", despite having a lot of family from there."

hockey,3dyvx1,Brunovitch,6,Mon Jul 20 17:48:09 2015 UTC,I just answer him!
hockey,3dyvx1,blazik,2,Mon Jul 20 18:35:55 2015 UTC,Would you switch back if Quebec gets the nordiques again?
hockey,3dyvx1,Brunovitch,2,Tue Jul 21 14:05:14 2015 UTC,"No.  I made the complete switch.  I live in Montréal too.  and it took me 15 years to switch.  Took me a long time not following hockey to make it.  But I became a hockey  fan again, mainly cause of Subban. I'm not about to let him go.  Plus, I don't like Québec city very much anymore."
hockey,3dyvx1,blazik,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:50 2015 UTC,What if there's some strange universe where sub an gets traded to the nordiques

hockey,3dyvx1,lurkerdontpost,4,Tue Jul 21 14:53:49 2015 UTC,"Some did, some cheer for the Bruins or even the Sens. Most would switch back."
hockey,3dyvx1,pluc61,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:08:22 2015 UTC,There's a good part that switched but it's not like they weren't any habs fans in QC before.  But a lot of people like teams with a lot of quebecers like Tampa back in the day...
hockey,3dyvx1,HopeImSane,4,Mon Jul 20 17:51:18 2015 UTC,I live in Quebec City but I'll still root for the Flames. Yeah I'll probably end up at one point cheering for the Nordiques (and it'll make me a hypocrite in the end) but the whole thing about how the new building was paid with public money (they even needed a special law to be voted -- Loi No. 204-- for it to go through) still pisses me off. Especially seeing how much Quebecor is ready to spend now on an expansion franchise.
hockey,3dyvx1,SenorPantsbulge,17,Mon Jul 20 18:45:15 2015 UTC,"They'll come. Trust me.  Been there, done that, literally got the t-shirt."
hockey,3dyvx1,PolarOpposites8,4,Mon Jul 20 17:40:41 2015 UTC,"Did you closely follow a team before? I followed the NHL of course but found it impossible to be a diehard of any team that wasn't ""mine"". I cheered for teams with Manitobans and players I liked but I don't know how anyone becomes a diehard of a non hometown team. I found it impossible.   I would like to say I was a big NHL fan before 2011, and I did have favourite teams, but I never followed any of them like I follow the jets."
hockey,3dyvx1,SenorPantsbulge,6,Mon Jul 20 18:22:12 2015 UTC,"I was always a massive hockey fan, but I never really had a favourite team. I was a Ducks fan, then an Islander fan, then a Thrashers fan - briefly - then an Oiler fan, all in pretty quick succession.  When they came back, I knew I'd found my group."
hockey,3dyvx1,PolarOpposites8,4,Mon Jul 20 18:35:23 2015 UTC,I was the same way. Nothing could replace a Winnipeg team.
hockey,3dyvx1,SenorPantsbulge,4,Mon Jul 20 18:45:05 2015 UTC,"I know it sounds corny as fuck, but I was the same way. I'd never go back to the way things were before.  I found out the Jets were officially coming back in the middle of a computer class. And I'm not ashamed to admit I happy-cried. People stared; didn't care. It was a beautiful day."

hockey,3dyvx1,FuckTheFuckingShit,4,Mon Jul 20 18:01:23 2015 UTC,haha I live quebec 99.5 % will switch back. And it ios a very conservative number. Sometime I have the impression that fans outside the region have no idea how popular the nordiques and hockey is here. It's understandable I guess.
hockey,3dyvx1,StoneG,2,Mon Jul 20 19:28:43 2015 UTC,"Shit, man.. the blue in their unis arouses me despite my hate for other teams."

hockey,3dyvx1,84awkm,4,Mon Jul 20 18:31:56 2015 UTC,I wouldn't go so far as to say geezers. I would say 25-30 and over will still be Leafs/Habs fans with the younger local kids leaning towards being a Sens fan.

hockey,3dyvx1,anonymousbosch,127,Mon Jul 20 17:43:12 2015 UTC,"Good.  While my city and our fan base benefited, Quebec should never have lost their team.  Time for the NHL to make a 20 year mistake right."
hockey,3dyvx1,DrDerpberg,103,Mon Jul 20 17:42:30 2015 UTC,"You make it sound like the league made a mistake; the reality that a lot of fans won't admit to themselves is that the team moved for financial reasons.  The league didn't move them.  They were a very small market team, playing US dollar salaries for players and getting Canadian dollar revenues.  And the Canadian dollar was tanking.  This was a Carling-O'Keefe decision."
hockey,3dyvx1,Podo13,12,Mon Jul 20 17:54:45 2015 UTC,"They were a very small market team, playing US dollar salaries for players and getting Canadian dollar revenues. And the Canadian dollar was tanking.   All of these are still true. I really hope history doesn't repeat itself."
hockey,3dyvx1,DrDerpberg,4,Mon Jul 20 17:57:03 2015 UTC,"Would probably help them if they were able to join while the Canadian Dollar was lower since the only way their revenue could go was up. The Jets left for the same reason IIRC. Not for total lack of support, but the CAD tanking really screwed Canadian teams up."
hockey,3dyvx1,Podo13,5,Mon Jul 20 18:14:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the Canadian dollar isn't as weak now as it was then either. It was in the high-60s cents USD. And it's still dropping along with the price of oil.   I guess the cap and revenue sharing will partly mitigate the problem, but I think it's unlikely the NHL would award  franchise if it thought those were needed to keep it afloat. I don't know how much Quebec has changed in the last 20 years but I don't think it's grown as fast as the cap."
hockey,3dyvx1,patismyname,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:55 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure, I just meant that if they were to join the league at a time when the CAD was at a low point and still be able to handle it financially, it would be totally fine onwards. Unless, that is, the CAD just keeps tanking for a prolonged time for some reason and screws over every single Canadian franchise."
hockey,3dyvx1,Minnesota_MiracleMan,54,Mon Jul 20 18:21:48 2015 UTC,"Look at what Bettman did to keep the Coyotes, Panthers, Penguins, (even the Thrashers) where they are.  You'll see back then that he never lifted a finger to try to keep the teams in Quebec City and Winnipeg.  Sure, there was no ownership at the time, yet the Yotes were run by the league for 2 years to make sure that they in Arizona"
hockey,3dyvx1,coolman1581,67,Mon Jul 20 18:08:15 2015 UTC,"He also worked to keep Edmonton, Calgary, and Ottawa from moving and had fair reasons to try and ""force"" them to relocate but didn't. He also never forced Quebec out, it was a decision by their Owners and it was tough to defend. What was Bettman supposed to do at that time to keep the Nordiques from moving? There are different reasons for the two situations (Quebec/Winnipeg compared to current teams) and they really are not similar."
hockey,3dyvx1,thekab,23,Mon Jul 20 18:31:12 2015 UTC,"Fucking this. People need to come to the conclusion that Bettman has done so much to grow the league since he took charge. The NHL has expanded and grown revenue wise at a record pace.   Sure, 1.5 seasons were taken away from us but it happens when you run a league. Hell, if you actually look into the lockouts bettman was just doing his job and not letting owners/players fuck him in the rear end financially."
hockey,3dyvx1,One_Eh,5,Mon Jul 20 21:39:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's fair to make that comparison when they're two decades apart.  The NHL is very different now than it was then, as is a number of other economic factors.  It was obviously not a terrible decision considering the Nordiques were struggling and the Avalanche sold out their building for years, won two cups, had a fantastic rivalry with the Red Wings and helped hockey really take off here."
hockey,3dyvx1,moffattron9000,13,Mon Jul 20 18:49:25 2015 UTC,"Obviously it only makes sense when its a Canadian team with tons of young talent.   It seems really weird that people come up with tons of excuses on why Quebec moved the first time, but always say that current struggling teams dont deserve to move. They basically went through the same situations without the actual attendance issues like some current teams are going through. Maybe they are different people, but really, atleast the Nordiques and Jets filled their stadiums."
hockey,3dyvx1,One_Eh,13,Mon Jul 20 18:23:06 2015 UTC,"I'd guess that the fact that they could fill their arenas as a part of why he was less likely to prevent a move. After all, if they're still losing money in markets at peak revenue, then there's little that can really be done there to change it. Compare that with a larger market, where long-term planning can lead to a more profitable team, eg, Denver."
hockey,3dyvx1,Minnesota_MiracleMan,4,Mon Jul 20 19:13:16 2015 UTC,"Thats a good point, havent really thought of it that way! Denver needed a hockey team, so Im really glad they were able to get a team, and support it and love players that I grew up idolizing aswell. They really couldnt have gotten a better team at the time."
hockey,3dyvx1,Becau5eRea5on5,6,Mon Jul 20 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"Winnipeg and Quebec had aging arenas as well as economic/currency issues. Both were issues the NHL/Bettman really couldn't control. Bettman never built an arena or changed the economy and currency for Phoenix/Arizona, Florida, Atlanta, or Pittsburgh. He didn't do much for Pittsburgh, Atlanta didn't have an arena in the near future and Bettman didn't do much to keep them in Atlanta and if anything was encouraging of a move to Winnipeg. Florida is going through some very rough times, but have an arena and are facing economic issues not because of a currency issue, but because of their market. They also have owners in a situation to invest the capital in trying to make the team work where they are. Nothing was keeping a group from doing the same in Quebec and Winnipeg. No one could and wanted to step up. Also, growing the game is something Bettman thinks, and has plenty of reason, can be properly grown. Phoenix/Arizona is really the only instance in which Bettman has stuck his neck out to keep the team in their current location. Has he tolerated some sub par situations? Sure. Do I think Arizona and Florida should probably me relocated elsewhere? Gun to my head, yes. But he has already approved of a relocation of a failed venture to Atlanta and is holding out hope that hockey can grow in the Miami/Phoenix markets like it has in Dallas, Los Angeles/Anaheim, and Tampa."
hockey,3dyvx1,DDB-,2,Mon Jul 20 19:30:55 2015 UTC,No one could and wanted to step up.   Ahem
hockey,3dyvx1,Minnesota_MiracleMan,6,Mon Jul 20 22:02:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not too quick to blame Bettman for letting the Canadian teams move. For one, those other teams you listed are American and have the benefit of a stronger dollar. Second, I believe both Edmonton and Calgary were both in big financial trouble in the late 90s or early 2000s and Bettman did help keep them in those cities.   The unfortunate reality was that it would have been very costly to try and keep the Jets and Nordiques afloat given the economy at the time."

hockey,3dyvx1,edditorRay,2,Mon Jul 20 21:22:36 2015 UTC,"How was he going to keep the Jets in Winnipeg at the time?  No salary cap, no revenue sharing, incredibly weak dollar, and the fans simply didn't support a losing team.  Bettman is responsible for us getting the Jets back, but there were many factors greater than one man that had us lose them in the first place."
hockey,3dyvx1,Sehs,3,Tue Jul 21 12:03:02 2015 UTC,"Lots of mistakes were made, not trying to put it all on the league by any means.

hockey,3dyvx1,JonnyBox,4,Mon Jul 20 18:06:58 2015 UTC,And the Canadian dollar was tanking.    Just like now!
hockey,3dyvx1,84awkm,3,Mon Jul 20 18:14:08 2015 UTC,Oil won't correct down far enough for the CAD to hit 'Move the Nords' levels for a long time.
hockey,3dyvx1,Mean_Mister_Mustard,4,Mon Jul 20 22:23:45 2015 UTC,What? CAD is in similar range now to the early 90s before the Nordiques moved. It was lowest in the early 2000s but the Nordiques were long gone by then.
hockey,3dyvx1,Brunovitch,7,Tue Jul 21 02:29:01 2015 UTC,"The biggest reason why the Nordiques moved was that the Quebec Colisée was antiquated even back in the 90s, and there was little to no interest at either the city or provincial level in funding a new arena. With no arena forthcoming, Marcel Aubut's group (and not Carling-O'Keefe, that company was bought out by rivals - and then-Montreal Canadiens owner - Molson in the late 80s) sold the team, and the NHL agreed to let them move.  At least in that regard, the situation is very different in Quebec City now, with an arena so modern that it pushed Geoff Molson's group to go ahead and modernize the Bell Centre to compete. And if you look at the teams Bettman fought to keep in place vs those he ""let go"", oftentimes the teams that left town were teams that didn't have an up-to-date place to play. No arenas were forthcoming in Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hartford, and the Thrashers were reportedly no longer welcome at Philips Arena, whereas the Coyotes and Panthers all had modern arenas, and still exist. Financial circumstances come and go, and fanbases can always be grown, but a new arena? That's a bit more complicated to build."
hockey,3dyvx1,Gnome_de_Plume,4,Mon Jul 20 18:22:51 2015 UTC,"no one mention it, but another reason for the Nordiques to left, was the ""no cap""  it made it hard to build a sucessful team and since the revenue was not high cause of the small Colisée and also because of the lack of TV right."
hockey,3dyvx1,Minnesota_MiracleMan,2,Mon Jul 20 18:42:50 2015 UTC,Though ironically they won the cup in Colorado the year after they moved.
hockey,3dyvx1,mick14731,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:34:48 2015 UTC,"The Coyotes and Panthers also now have ownership groups that are investing a ton of capital into keeping those teams where they are at. Modern Arena + Dedicated Owners are tough to move out. Not saying impossible, but of current non NHL cities, Quebec is the only other option that can offer those two immediate objects. Winnipeg was beforehand.  You (not you in particular, just generalizing here) can say those teams should/need to be relocated, but it takes two to tango. Just now, has Quebec entered the fold as a legitimate place to relocate a team as the new stadium will be ready for next season."
hockey,3dyvx1,moutonbleu,2,Mon Jul 20 18:35:38 2015 UTC,"If certain economist are to be believed, almost that exact situation is quickly approaching. A decline Canadian economy and depreciating Canadian dollar. It could be a rough next couple of years for the small market Canadian teams."

hockey,3dyvx1,DarthReilly,4,Mon Jul 20 17:57:55 2015 UTC,They might eliminate conferences and create distinct division. No east or west. Just 8 groups of 4 teams that are close one to the other. Reduce the games played outside the division and increase those inside the division. That would create epic rivalries. Then teams 1 and 2 of each divison makes the playoffs (a little like the Champions League format). Could be a solution.
hockey,3dyvx1,alpha11110,3,Mon Jul 20 19:43:24 2015 UTC,They might just have to deal with uneven conferences until the Seattle or Vegas group is successful.

hockey,3dyvx1,RelentlessNick10,12,Mon Jul 20 18:02:01 2015 UTC,"I was wondering about this after they said seattle wasn't submitting a bid....maybe they just go with 4 divisions of 8 instead of conferences.  You play everyone outside of your division once at home and once away (48 games) and you play everyone in the division 2 at home 2 away (28 games).  then 2 games at random from each of the other 3 divisions for the 6 games left over.  That way Detroit can be in the ""central"" and not be in the same division as any pacific time zone teams"
hockey,3dyvx1,hockeyrocks5757,22,Mon Jul 20 18:12:44 2015 UTC,"So it would probably go like:  Central:  Detroit   Chicago  St.Louis  Nashville  Colorado  Winnipeg  Dallas  Minnesota  West:  Anaheim  Las Vegas  Vancouver  Calgary  Edmonton  San Jose  Los Angeles  Arizona  Northeast:  Montreal  Quebec  Toronto  Ottawa  Boston  New York Rangers  New York Islanders  Buffalo  Southeast:  Pittsburgh  Philadelphia  Columbus  Carolina  Tampa Bay  Florida  Washington  New Jersey  The only problem is New Jersey isn't with their fellow New York rivals, but other than that these divisions look good.  Playoffs would be top 4 from each division, and the bracket would be:  C1 vs. C4  C2 vs. C3  W1 vs. W4  W2 vs. W3  NE1 vs. NE4  NE2 vs. NE3  SE1 vs. SE4  SE2 vs. SE3  when it gets to the third round, the Central winner will play the West winner, and the Northeast winner would play the Southeast winner.  They're also pretty balanced to.  Central is stacked, obviously.  The West has Anaheim, L.A., a promising Edmonton team, Calgary, and Vancouver, who have a year or two of playoffs left in them.  The Northeast has Montreal, Boston, Rangers, Islanders, a promising Buffalo team, and Ottawa.  The Southeast has Tampa, Washington, Pittsburgh, Columbus, and Florida."

Detroit is gonna do just find regardless of what division they are in.  Columbus is still a new team and needs all the help they can get to really dig in and become a stable, successful franchise.  Also since QC would almost certainly be in the Atlantic, moving Detroit to the Central means everyone else can stay put.  If they move QC into the Atlantic and CBJ to the Central, that means someone else has to move from the Atlantic to the Metro. Who would that be?  Can't be Boston (split up Habs rivalry).  Can't be Florida or Tampa (they're a both-or-nothing deal). Buffalo?  They wouldn't like that, but that would probably be the best option."

hockey,3dyvx1,CondorAvenue,5,Mon Jul 20 20:53:50 2015 UTC,It seems insane to restructure the entire division system because Detroit doesn't like having to stay up late a half dozen times a year.
hockey,3dyvx1,bigdon199,8,Mon Jul 20 18:58:19 2015 UTC,"not just that, but also a lot of west coast fans miss parts of games because they start while the fans are still at work.  And as much as restructuring the divisions seems excessive, from the NHL's perspective, detroit in the west would mean lower ratings in multiple markets, and with the rapidly increasing share media rights deals have on HRR, the NHL would much rather restructure the divisions than they would move detroit west.  The NHL has already shown that when they decided to make the conferences unbalanced just to make sure detroit wasn't* in the west, and make sure that every team in each division was within a time zone of the others"
hockey,3dyvx1,bigdon199,2,Mon Jul 20 19:29:27 2015 UTC,"a lot of west coast fans miss parts of games because they start while the fans are still at work.    a game starting at 4:30 is a much easier problem to deal with than one starting at 10:30.  You can DVR both games and when you come home from work, have dinner settle in, then you can watch your 4:30 game and zip through all the commercials.  In order to watch the 10:30 game you have to get up early and try and squeeze it in before you go to work the next day."

Regular season is one thing, but before the switch, the maximum number of possible playoff games in their own time zone - 7 out of a possible 28.    It wasn't just Detroit, Dallas was in a bad situation - in the same division as ANA, SJS, LAK, and PHX, so they are essentially 2 time zones ahead of 75% of their division.  Don't forget Minnesota in the same division as Vancouver. On top of that Winnipeg was still in Atlantas's division.

hockey,3dyvx1,NobleHound,8,Tue Jul 21 02:40:28 2015 UTC,"Here’s why we would have instant hate for the Nordiques and I’ll try a comparison with the hate we have for the Bruins. I’m a Montrealer by the way.  There’s a rivalry between Quebec city and Montréal that’s been present for ages.  Most Montrealers think this is a one-way rivalry, meaning Quebec city hates our guts and we just don’t care.  This is partly true, but it’s mostly a subset of smaller city vs. bigger city in the neighborhood type of rivalry.  Like Montrealers or other Canadian cities talk about Toronto but TO doesn’t really care.  I know this is true for some bigger US cities like NYC.  The thing is we do look down on Quebec city to a point… saying it’s a big village (they HATE that) and that if not for the Provincial Governement it would be much smaller (which is very true)... All in good fun.  Qc city had a sort of revival in recent years and became bolder and honestly more vicious in their criticism of Montréal (which has its own sets of problems to deal with, but that’s another matter)  Anyways, right now, having only one hockey team meant that we couldn’t have another point of contention… if the Nordiques come back QC city residents will become even more insufferable than they are now and would be punching above their weight category.   And boy would I love that!  The fact that Quebecor is the sponsor makes it even sweeter as they a reviled by a good part of the population (Think a smaller Comcast) and that the main equity holder is now the fucking leader of the PQ (a separatist party) just makes for a wonderful clusterfuck of hate flowing through the province.  If you compare rivalries, well the rivalry with the Nordiques would be like a sibling rivalry with that annoying little brother while the Habs-Bruins rivalry is a little bit like sticking it up the bully’s ass."

The biggest problem for them after travel is game times for their fans. Would it really be the worst thing ever to start Detroit's games while playing in the other timezones an hour eariler to appease the Detroit fans? I see that as a fairly simple fix, and really Detroit is a big enough draw that enough people would easily get off work a little earlier."

If they could add one more game then everyone  would play their conference  opponents  5 times a year.  Playoffs would look alot like today. Top 3 from each conference  get in then the next 4 best teams in the league  are slotted and play the 4 conference winners.  The conference  finals would be the winners of the bracket  facing off, re-ordered based on record/tiebreakers  This way Detroit  plays the Pacific  teams as much as any other  east coast team.   They would have 2 to 3 games with a 2 hour difference but at least it would be against  a rival  and games could start at 6 mountain  time 8 eastern  time."

If you watched Bettman's presser on this process, this application process is merely to test the market and identify if expansion is feasible and which cities are ready. Seattle can still jump in at any point and these deadlines seem to be more of suggestions than anything else.  Vegas and Quebec City will certainly win some brownie points, but I get the feeling that Seattle will be allowed into discussions if an arena is figured out soon."

hockey,3dzi7l,ManNotHamburger,8,Mon Jul 20 23:58:33 2015 UTC,When did they say that? Everything I saw they said there was no formal ongoing process to expand. That's why it was only a ticket drive.

hockey,3dzi7l,artvandelay1994,8,Mon Jul 20 20:43:07 2015 UTC,Yeah. There is probably a Seattle clause in whatever was agreed upon by the Owners.
hockey,3dzi7l,Minnesota_MiracleMan,30,Mon Jul 20 20:45:10 2015 UTC,right right because all these billionarie are falling over them selves to build a hockey/basketball areana in Seattle.  No one built it in ten years. So they are seeing something up there everyone else isn't seeing. If there was a huge desire for NBA or NHL. Someone would have stepped up. But no one has and no one will unless they city/state pays.
hockey,3dzi7l,Mbanks,13,Mon Jul 20 20:49:23 2015 UTC,If the minority of hockey fans think this issue is worth dumping the current Seattle city council they are beyond stupid. Seattle is growing just fine without paying for an unnecessary arena that always over promises and under delivers.
hockey,3dzi7l,PNWQuakesFan,4,Mon Jul 20 22:23:55 2015 UTC,"Well, building an arena solely from private money isn't usually the way things are done. I mean, it totally should be the way things are done, but these billionaires probably aren't lining up around the corner to build anything due to the status quo of getting city governments to fork over some significant incentives for them to do so. Also iirc isn't the city on a on a ""NBA first"" agenda? I guess the only thing I'm trying to get at is that Seattle seems to have a lot of pre-requisites attached to welcoming an NHL team that probably aren't that close to fruition at this stage of the game."

For comparison in the US, the NHL has no team in Atlanta (#8 TV market), Houston (#10 TV market), Seattle (#14 TV market), Sacramento (#20 TV market), Portland (#22 TV market), Indianapolis (#25 TV market), Baltimore (#26 TV market), or San Diego (#28 TV market).  All these cities host professional sports teams currently.  Most of them have more than one team.  The league also draws on one of the deepest talent bases in all professional sports (probably behind Soccer and Basketball globally).  Hockey is popular in Canada, the US, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovakia.  The game is growing across Europe in especially in Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Norway and Germany.  If any league can do it, it's the NHL."

To see the mayor of Quebec City and the president of Quebecor work hand-in-hand with a number of politicians to bully the rest of the political class on a provincial level with a special law. All so we could get a new, 400-millions stadium, all paid by public funds.  Don't get me wrong. I love hockey. I know I'll end up loving the Nordiques in the end (which will makes me a bit of an hypocrite). But I hate the fact that, as we are now living with austerity measures in 2015, and we could not have the foresight of not spending such a lrge amount of money with public funds 4 years earlier. The politicians who participated on all levels to this showed they were kids with a credit card who didn't gave a damn about busting the limit.  Oh well. What's done is done. The stadium is now standing proud and tall. I just hope others city such as Seattle will have the foresight to ask private investors to fund their new arena, or at least do it in a partnership where public funds won't be paying the majority of the bill."

Panthers and Canes are probably worth a bit less based on fan support and popularity but for all of the teams it may be a wash to relocate vs bid on an expansion team especially considering the NHL's hesitance in the matter

hockey,3dzi7l,lechuck333,2,Tue Jul 21 02:53:13 2015 UTC,"Ontario isn't the problem. Hamilton is. You have a rink in not a great part of town. You have no businesses to support it locally, a 20% poverty rate, low incomes...  So why house the team in a city that can't support it? I know people would come from elsewhere to watch, but if that's the case then stick it closer to those people.  I live and work in the Hammer. It's got a lot of personality but it's a fucking hole socially and economically...  Would there be an entire parking lot just for e bikes? Or would people just offer up their front lawns for 20 bucks like they do for the Ti-cats.  It is one of the least desirable places to stick a team amongst the cities that most often get mentioned. At least in my opinion."
hockey,3dzi7l,Mr_Bashdangles,2,Tue Jul 21 03:10:09 2015 UTC,"An NHL team would help economically. The fact that it's a Canadian team would help (unlike a city like Phoenix).

hockey,3dzi7l,lechuck333,3,Tue Jul 21 10:29:38 2015 UTC,"Been to Copps dozens of times for concerts, and other than Hamilton's stupid one-way streets in the downtown, it's pretty viable.  Link it nicely with the GO train and public transit and it would make some serious money.  Lots of Toronto folks who couldn't get Leafs season tickets might consider it if the prices are decent and it's easily accessible by GO.  As for local businesses, I don't think you would have much of a problem at all.  You could easily draw on Burlington for businesses as well.  Hell, Defasco would probably put their name all over it for public image."

Plus, you're right on the corner of the GTA, with 'ssauga and Brantford, St. Catharines and the Burles not that far at all. Plus, people from Kitchener, Cambridge or Guelph would probably prefer to drive to Hamilton than the ACC, Pegulaville or Detroit. I think it would be a solid move."

This is a place that has some of the highest property taxes in the province because it has no industry to tax.   As far as location of the city and the communities around it to draw from. Absolutely it makes sense, but on a much more real level. It's a terrible idea."

They compare it to Arizona, but Arizona has tons of competition for its sports dollars.  It has all four major leagues, plus very popular college teams, plus a bunch of smaller pro teams in various sports.  Vegas has a somewhat popular college basketball team, a minor league baseball team, and fights that cater mostly to tourists.  And a lot more locals with money to spend than people seem to think it does.  Not to mention that the arena is centrally located and easy to get to from everywhere in the valley.

hockey,3e1zwq,lippyjose,3,Tue Jul 21 13:15:52 2015 UTC,"I love the replay around 1:44 to see how well-placed that shot was.  Vernon was damn near at the bottom of the circle challenging him.   What I absolutely loved about Gretzky's shooting and what made him such a great scorer was his ability to shoot 'off rhythm'.  He'd wait just a split second longer or release the shot a split second before it seems like the shot should come.  Kinda like him shooting on the 'off beat'.  It's like he'd have a hitch in his shot and it seemed to throw a goalies ability to perceive it and move off.  Great players still do that and it's still effective.  Crosby is great at that, so is Kessel, so is Kane, so is Datsyuk.  They release the puck after/before when it ""should be"" released....and it throws off timing and movement.  It's pretty well-known that backhands are difficult for goalies because the release can be hard to read coming off the blade.  3 of the 4 guys (Sid, Kane, Pav) I mentioned above who are great at delaying that extra moment are also probably the 3 guys with the best backhanders in the league.  I've always thought it was interesting how Crosby uses a really small curve.  His blade being pretty straight means he can release the puck from anywhere on his blade, rather than the usual rolling of the puck to the toe.  This catches goalies off guard as its just harder to read.  Also, having that straighter curve really helps on the backhand.  Both Kane and Datsyuk use a pretty similar pattern.  It's a long blade that's mostly straight until around the mid-toe where there's a slight curve and a slight opening of the blade face.  (Both are similar to the Shanahan pattern.  Giroux uses this pattern as well).  So they both have the straight portion of the blade that allows them to release the puck at different points on the blade, making it harder for goalies to read.  And they have great backhands as well.  At the NHL level a 'quick release' beats 'pure speed' of shot just about everytime.  (That's what was fucking scary about Sakic---he had such a fast release and the miles-per-hour behind it---unreal).  Players don't have to have the hardest, in pure speed, shot to be effective scorers.  Being able to shoot 'off rhythm' and having a quick release that can be disguised are a big part of being an effective goal scorer."

hockey,3dzzct,FullSharkAlligator,21,Mon Jul 20 22:40:22 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine it's their first choice, or even their second choice, but if they intend to add two teams, they can't really say no to Quebec at this point, can they?  Expansion serves two purposes: long term growth for the league, and a short term cash infusion for the 30 current owners. You can make a reasonable case as to why Quebec would not be ideal for long term growth, but as far as the cash infusion case is concerned, their money is as good as anyone else's.  If I'm the owner of an NHL franchise that is currently losing money (or barely breaking even), I take the money from Vegas for sure, and you better believe I'd also take my 16.67 million share from Quebec, even if its not ideal for long term growth. There is nobody else offering to pay that kind of money right now."
hockey,3dzzct,dnx3,7,Mon Jul 20 23:05:22 2015 UTC,And adding a new market (Vegas) might make it more palatable to go back to and old one at the same time. Adding Vegas could make it better for Quebec to get a team this round.

Detroit and Cbj bitched for years being in the EST and having to stay up until 1am to watch reg season games. it losses ratings by fans that arent able to watch the game.   It doesnt help Quebecs situation that the dollar is at what, 76 cents to the US? If Quebec does get a team I'll be surprised."

hockey,3dzzct,Formerleafsfan,7,Mon Jul 20 23:41:23 2015 UTC,"The problem is pretty straightforward though:  New generations of Leafs fans, current and potential futures, may very well abandon the Leafs for the newer, more successful team. They don't have the same allegiance to the team as a result of being disenfranchised with the team's performance on-ice.   MLSE would never allow it, and despite the lack of success they're still the most powerful voice in the NHL from a purely fiscal perspective.   Hamilton is a possibility, but it's very much over MLSE's dead body."

All the divisions would become conferences with LV joining the Pacific, Detroit moving to the Central, and QC joining the Atlantic.  It wouldn't be as big of a burden for Detroit, because they would be playing the pacific teams the same amount wether they stayed in the Atlantic conference or joined the Central.  It would also reinvigorate Detroit's rivalries with Chi, Stl, and Col."

hockey,3dzzct,sdenoon,4,Tue Jul 21 00:15:49 2015 UTC,"I do not. I remember that it went to a vote, but the players wanted the current system.

Detroit's great, they have an amazing history, and I respect the hell out of the organization, but if it makes the most sense to move them, then do it.  Yes, geography sucks balls, but why should a new team have to have more of a negative impact just because someone else was around before?    Just because Detroit complains doesn't mean they should get special treatment, it should be based on A. What's the fairest thing they can do, and B. What's best for the league.  There are no rivalries for Columbus in the West, whereas arguably Detroit is better in the West than East in that respect.  Also, the travel impact (if I'm not mistaken) is less on Detroit than Columbus, so if that's correct, how can they possibly argue that they shouldn't be moved?  History is history, but teams should be treated equally and fairly based on the situation today."

If 'Lumbus goes, I'd assume Detroit would slide into the Metro since you can't move either of the Florida franchises out of the same division (for rivalry (read: monetary) purposes). Plus, Detroit hasn't been in the Atlantic long enough to really make a hated divisional rival, and they'll always draw a crowd no matter who they play, so it's easiest for the league to move them.   That being said, Bettman has said he doesn't think the conferences need to be even (that bastard), so I doubt this impacts anything at all and they won't re-align divisions again for a long time. I just wish we'd even up, because there is a bias against Eastern teams having to fight for the same amount of playoff spots with more teams competing for them."

hockey,3dzzct,MooseFlyer,3,Tue Jul 21 04:28:42 2015 UTC,"""Investor.""  At $500M for a team, you have to be a moron to buy an NHL team and expect any money back.  Forbes as of this year values the 11th most valuable NHL franchise at $500M, making essentially 2/3 of the league worth less than a theoretical expansion franchise, which by definition with no history and no certain fans in place should be at best close to the bottom.    They're obviously basing that on incomplete information, but don't pretend that an NHL team is an investment today.  It's a money pit.  If you're lucky, you'll break even, but it's not the NFL.  There are 3 teams that are guaranteed to make money, and everyone else is hoping, or going through a cyclical up phase.  On top of that $500M, you also have to pay for somewhere for the team to actually play.  Most arenas today are also north of $500M, meaning that with the NHL's cut the cost of an entry level NHL team today is over a billion dollars.    At a billion dollars invested, if you're meeting the long term inflation target of 2%, you have to make $20M a year to break even.  More if inflation rises.  The NHL is very protective of its numbers, but I'd wager a third of the teams in the league at best make that.  The only reason someone buys an NHL franchise today is because they are truly passionate about it, not because they see it as an investment or plan to make money off of it.  The only other option is that they're idiots."

hockey,3e1khw,deadlyernest,6,Tue Jul 21 06:33:50 2015 UTC,"This depends a lot on the goalie's ability to move the puck. Lundqvist, for example, will have less of an effect on the breakout than Bishop does. Outside of that, they are going to communicate with their D, but the degree to which they do depends on the individual team's systems"
hockey,3e1khw,hardcoreotter,5,Tue Jul 21 09:46:14 2015 UTC,"Ben Bishop's puck handling ability makes such a difference for the entire team. When he goes behind the net to play the puck one of the opposing defenders chases him leaving five Lightning players open with four opposing skaters covering them.   When Bishop plays the puck we always have a guy open. Both defenders will be in the opposite corners with the wingers along the boards by the blue lines and the center in the middle of the circles to break up the middle. Bishop has the option to throw the puck into either corner or launch it around the boards to either winger.  Bishop's numbers indicate he's an average goalie but we normally don't spend a lot of time in our zone because he's so good at handling the puck and getting it to other guys on the ice.  Fun Fact: In the playoffs Ben Bishop had more points than Drouin, Morrow, Sustr, Namestnikov, J.T. Brown, and Brian Boyle."

hockey,3e0owf,Rcg2005,9,Tue Jul 21 03:58:57 2015 UTC,"Injuries is probably the big reason our PP sucked last year.  I made a post on /r/penguins back in April that detailed the stats month to month of the team.  Something I noticed while compiling the data was that as our blue line diminished, so did the PP.  We had a small uptick when we started to get our Defensemen back, but it promptly dropped off after the Arizona game that saw Letang get injured.  Without any real PP quarterbacks out there to distribute the puck and get it up ice quickly the PP suffered.  Imagine Crosby and Malkin as the sights on a rifle.  You can have the best sights in the world, but without a firing pin the rifle is useless.  Although, you would have thought one of our remaining stars would have stepped up."

He is a right-handed shot, so if Nichushkin doesn't grab the spot, I think it has to be Sharp's. If he earns a space on the top line, the sky's the limit; his overall numbers took a big step back last year, but when he was playing with top 6 linemates, his production wasn't that far off from where it was in 2013-14."

hockey,3e0owf,FutureGeriatric,3,Tue Jul 21 03:43:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that Johnson won't continue to be one of the more productive players in the league, but rather that I don't see it as probable that he's in the top 5 in scoring, mostly because I don't think the Triplets can replicate what were the 3 highest 5v5 On-ice Sh% among any Forwards with at least 15 GP last year.  Given the quality of chances that they create (at least according to what basic shot quality metrics we have), I think that their On-ice Sh% will still be among the highest in the league, and I think that slightly increased PP production and a renewed opposition focus on Stamkos (who I think will once again be among the league's points leaders, especially if Drouin progresses enough to play on his Left Wing) will make up some of the difference, but I don't see him doing better than 13th in the league in P/Gm (which is where he was last year, if you don't count one-game wonders)."

Also, I wouldn't say Crosby has trouble scoring rookie Crosby numbers, last time he played 80+ games (I think a season ago) he got 100+ points. And the second last time he played 80+ games, he got 109 points.  Last season, Crosby had 84 pts in 77 games, and Crosby had the mumps a while and scoring was down league wide so it wasn't that bad for Crosby  2013-2014, 80 games, 104 pts  2012-2013, 2011-2012, and 2010-2011, he didn't play a full season. Was well over point per game though.  2009-2010, 80 games played, 109 points.  McDavid is going to be playing with Hall, Eberle, the Nuge on the power play, and maybe Nurse if he plays in the NHL this season? I think he'll get above point per game unless he get's injured."

That's some sneaky shit right there.   Voldemort wouldn't even have had a body if Dumbledore had been like ""No, he's not allowed to be in the Tournament. Fuck what that cup says, there are rules."""

No, if he hadn't let fake Moody put the Cup in the maze, then Harry wouldn't have Portkey'd out of there and Cedric wouldn't have died.  I agree about him being mean to the Slytherin kids at the end of book one though. Can you imagine the resentment the Slytherins felt towards Dumbledore?
