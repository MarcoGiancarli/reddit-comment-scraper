Have you been working somewhere else relevant in the mean time? I am worried because if you are very far along in the exam process with minimal or no relevant experience that could be an issue. They may not be able to pay you a full FSA salary until you get some years under your belt.  As for noting it on your resume you can of course put ASA after your name on the top and then in your first section list all the FSA exams that you have completed along with when you plan on going to the FAC. Or if you can think of another creative way to just simply spell out ""I've done everything but the FAC"" that would probably be fine too but make sure it's the first section.  Good luck out there."

Here's the thing. Actuarial material is not conceptually hard. It's being able to recall all of it and do a test in under 3 hours that's hard.  Yes, you need to conceptually understand the material but being able to drill the material into your head and regurgitate it instantly is more important. Test tactics are necessary.  Is there a better way of measuring future potential? Definitely. But right now, it's testing. By far, the number one thing employers look for when figuring out who to interview is exams passed. It doesn't matter how you passed them, just as long as you passed them.  As for when to take your exam, most people recommend one month of practice exams prior to your sitting. P is given every 3 months so you've got a lot of flexibility there.  I can't speak for Wackerly's text, but I don't recall there being any difficulty spikes when using ASM for P."

actuary,3e34sz,DirtyMikeNTheBoiz,2,Wed Jul 22 01:24:05 2015 UTC,"I agree that despite the odds of not passing, it's probably beneficial for the next attempt if you go and see the testing center and types of questions that are on the test.  See what the actual number of questions were asked in each of the categories compared to the range the syllabus had listed.  Also (this part might just be for FM) immediately after the exam, there's a print out that tells you how well you did in different categories, so you can see how well you did on the material you already know."

(annuity models, interest related stuff, some basic stock concepts such as puts/stocks). If so you should also be able to do FM. Pick your third exam based on what you feel more comfortable with.  Also if you did any courses that would fill a VEE credit then you can claim this after doing two exams, which is also quite useful. You can go here to check this."

actuary,3e2nfl,taooverpi,2,Tue Jul 21 15:30:27 2015 UTC,"Great. Do P, FM, then either MFE or MLC and apply for the VEE credits. With previous internship experience and analyst experience you should do just fine."

There are definitely some answers on the exam designed to trip you up (the variance, found correctly, might be an incorrect answer for a question asking about the SD, for example). There is no point spending a ton of time studying, then missing a question because you didn't read it correctly/rushed through and made a silly mistake."

I spent over 175 hours in the past 3 weeks studying every section in the actex manual front to back, save for the practice exams, and after my first exam on ADAPT I'm currently at only a level 3.  I'm freaking out over how unprepared I feel, like while I know the material I never anticipated how hard the typical exam questions are. I'm allotting 55-60 hours this week on ADAPT. What's the best advice you can give me to get up to at least a level 5? How did you go about pacing and memorizing the different procedures and tricks?  Oh, and congrats dude. Here's wishing you all the best"
actuary,3dzlq4,tetrology,4,Tue Jul 21 04:23:27 2015 UTC,"I started using ADAPT like 10-15 days before my exam, and the first test I actually lost points, dropping from a 3 to a 2 something.  For me it was because I studied entirely from a probability textbook, so I had zero readiness for actual test questions, I just understood the concepts  The point is that the more questions you do, the better you'll get at doing them. It almost didn't make sense, but all of a sudden a week into using ADAPT I was getting a ton better, and went from doing well on 3's to doing very well on 5's - something sort of clicked after doing enough problems.  In terms of pacing I think it's important to take the time you need to answer each question. I know it's 6 minute per problem, on average, but there are going to be some questions you can answer in like 30 seconds, so if you need 10 minutes to work through a given problem, use that time - it's better to spend an extra few minutes getting a question right than cutting yourself off after 6-8 minutes and guessing.  In any case, best of luck!"

actuary,3e0ith,ActuariallyInclined,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:36:06 2015 UTC,Well I was doing a double major of Stat and Actsc so I guess that's good. I still have stat :)   And yeah I totally agree with that. It seemed like a good idea at the time because of the overlap of material in my courses and the actuarial exams.

actuary,3e0ith,cohomologie,6,Tue Jul 21 12:52:53 2015 UTC,"From my experience, filling spreadsheets and making (often ugly) presentations for higher ups is what most people do in companies nowadays.   Sounds like a sad life, but it can become interesting when you start to understand what you are doing and how it helps out the company, because then you can get creative and independent with it.   But excel aside, what other things do you like: programming, data analysis? If so, data scientist or data analyst could be something for you."

I was thinking about 'data analyst', but that seems like such a broad term. My problem right now is deciding what to major in. Would a Stat major and CS minor leave me with a lot of opportunities?"
actuary,3e0ith,Phrich,3,Tue Jul 21 01:48:00 2015 UTC,"You're right 'data analyst' can be anything analytical. If there is one thing that I've learned in adult life is that doing something in practice is the only way to find out how it really is. Same for a job (that might be different in different companies). So maybe just choose a mayor and minor that have good job prospects and that you really like, and have faith, with the details out later ? Too bad I'm not from the US so I cannot comment too much on the study details. I'm a pure mathematician who worked as data analyst and now as actuary,and I do not know unemployed mathematicians..."

You might want to simply invest in something you're really interested in. My 2nd major was biology.  If you study something you like and get better marks as a result I think it will help your career more than picking the 'right' second major. You'll have plenty of time to force yourself to study things for the sake of career only when university is over and the real exams begin.

I am very happy with my choice so far (still in college but interning at a major Life Insurance company). A lot of my classes don't necessarily relate 100% to the work I do here but I have been very appreciative of what I've learned. I'm not writing proofs or solving systemic inequalities constrained to a budget curve, but I am tasked with thinking in logical/systematic ways and required to consider many controls/constraints when solving/diagnosing problems.  It's easy to get into the habit of saying, ""Oh I don't need to actually learn this - Abstract Algebra isn't necessarily something very important to being an actuary"". Make sure that you challenge yourself in your classes and learn the process and why formulas work because THAT is what is going to help out in the future."

I only have one major (which is actually Actuarial Science) and several minors (because certain minors can quickly be achieved by one or two additional courses).

The way Im thinking is if you are  covered for an x-2 loss, how can you determine what the expected value of a loss that is not x-2?   Edit: in other words something that is not x-2 is undefined in a sense, it can be anything."
actuary,3dwct9,InfinitPossibilities,2,Mon Jul 20 02:44:22 2015 UTC,"I think you're probably missing the part starting at 2 and going on to infinity.  The probability is getting tiny, but the manufacturer is still going to have to pay for that two.  So for instance, you don't include x = 4 when you set the range to be .6 to 2.  At x = 4, the manufacturer will still have a loss of 2 not paid by the insurance policy.  So you want to split it into two integrals: what you have from .6 to 2, and from 2 to infinity: 2*f(x) -- the amt not paid by insurance, times the probability.  Make sense?"

Get good at the geometric progression, both the sum to n and the sum to infinity, as you'll be using both a lot. Other than that some integration is used (useful integrals like ∫f'(x)ef(x) dx are given in the notes) but they aren't challenging. The only other thing that seems to come up a lot is linear interpolation, so get practice at that. There's also a chapter on basic stochastic methods that requires you to determine moments of probability distributions, but that's something that can be learned  Other than that it's mostly general reasoning. I wouldn't think FAC is necessary for CT1 unless you don't feel confident. I'd say that a good test is if the potential candidate can derive the formula for sums of geometric series without checking a book, they'll be fine.   I haven't done any other CT's yet (obviously) but I can imagine combinatorics, complex numbers, non-linear iterative methods etc. will play a part, and a candidate without a degree may benefit from the FAC in those cases."

You will not struggle for employment as a life actuary with experience.  GI work is quite varied, can be very specialised, often involves working with people who don't understand actuaries, usually requires more stats, and can be harder to find and change jobs.

actuary,3diz14,jyz002,7,Thu Jul 16 18:06:36 2015 UTC,"Go to actuarialdirectory.org Search by state or city. Sort by company. Bookmark the careers page from all of the companies currently employing actuaries.  Check them all at least once/week. Odds are if it is on indeed or monster or whatever, they have entirely too many applicants that aren't really qualified and your application might be overlooked for some mundane detail on your resume, etc.  I would highly recommend focusing on networking instead. Search the CAS and SOA sites for actuarial groups in your area and email them with a request to join. Go to meetings and introduce yourself. Go through the actuarialdirectory.org list and email a bunch of people; ask if you can spend a few minutes with them (in person or over the phone) to get their advice on getting into the field. Portray yourself as an ideal candidate, ask good questions, and at the end ask if they know of any opportunities you should look into our any people you should contact. And remember to thank them!   In my experience, you get much more interest in your resume this way. Also, if they have your details and are thinking about opening a position, they can interview you without posting and you have less competition. There are many small, independent consulting firms that may find an entry level person is useful to have, but they don't need a dedicated ""careers"" page on their website and dealing with the overwhelming responses from aggregation sites makes it difficult to find people, so the best ways to get into that is with networking and/or using a headhunter.  I would say don't just go on indeed, etc.  and apply and wait. It doesn't work. Treat finding a job like studying for an exam - you wouldn't pass P if all you did was pass a probability class in college. You need to put in the hours and effort. Good luck :)"

The private sector is definitely not the only place hiring entry level. Take a look at your local and state government websites and email their HR departments, include a resume and inquire of any positions. Data analyst looks amazing and it will open up a lot more doors as working with data and stats is huge in govt.

I passed 3 exams in a year,  getting a 9 on each, and it was not any harder than getting an A+ in the Math courses I take at a second-rate university. I found complex analysis to be much harder than the actuarial science material,  and anyone who does well in math should breeze through the exams with consistent studying.   I switched into mathematical finance because I found the stochastic models on MFE to be the most stimulating material in actuarial science,  but even that is being cut out of the curriculum this year.  That means that the only ""hard""  topics left in the ASA exams are credibility theory and maybe some of the more obscure nonparametric/Bayesian estimators on C. I think most people are just not used to putting in consistent effort into their studies,  and the exams are a bit of a wake up call to those people."

The word in of the questions are nothing like you've seen before. The questions are are tougher than what you're used to, sure, but it's the phrasing of the questions and amount of memorization that really gets to you.   2) FM requires 3x the number of formulas but is also no where near as hard. The first 80% of the exam is all interest theory and basically boils down to knowing how to take a present value of a lump sum and annuities.  The last 20% is the financial economics part and is essentially graph reading.   3) MFE is something else. Less material than P, but more formulas than FM. And the material is hard. Apparently stochastic processes is being dropped which is a huge change considering that was about 1/3 the exam. The rest isn't too bad though.   4) I'm sitting for C in October, but Ive gone through almost half the manual on the last two weeks.

actuary,3dgs83,Auready,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:59:15 2015 UTC,"Since no one else seems to be taking you seriously and I can't sleep, I'll try to chime in. Disclaimer: I am a rising senior currently in the midst of my second actuarial internship, so my experience is somewhat limited.   Exams are time consuming, but very doable. The biggest thing you'll need is discipline. Imo, discipline is way more important than intelligence when it comes to passing these exams. In my experience interacting with other actuaries, most are very satisfied and happy with their job, and are able to balance work/social life successfully. For me, personally, my schedule right now is work from 9-5, eat dinner and relax 5-7, study for however long I'm in the mood to 7-8/9?, more relax 9-11, and then sleep and repeat. I study roughly 3 hours on sat/sun, as well.   I've talked to several other actuaries, who range from studying up to 8 hours a day on weekends and a couple hours on weekdays, to ones who got to Fellow just by mainly studying during company alloyed study hours. So it really depends. But overall, work/life balance is very doable. Try to pass at least one exam before end of sophomore year so you can start applying to internships early. Internships are CRUCIAL if you want a good chance to land an entry level job. Good luck! :)"

It still doesn't hurt to ask, though - I've heard of companies rescinding offers when people try to negotiate on salary, but that's uncommon and I don't see why anyone would want to work for a company like that anyway.

If you do take it now, and eventually get an actuarial job, it is likely that you will receive a pay rise that will make up for the £250 you spent. Most employers offer an extra £500-£1000 per exam/exemption.  I don't think having the exam passed will give you an advantage however when applying for jobs, unless you are studying an unrelated course, in which case it would show that you have some mathematical ability (this doesn't sound like it case from your post, I assume you are studying a mathematical course)"

If you have covered most of the syllabus of CT1, you can still apply and they will look at your case individually.   You basically have to send them a copy of your uni syllabus along with a copy of theirs, and write notes to indicate where each point on the syllabus is met. If they believe your exam was difficult enough and you scored a high enough mark, you get an exemption. You only pay if it's granted, so it's worth a try if you think you have a chance!  If you can post a link to the syllabus of the relevant modules, and your exam marks, I can give you my opinion."

I've been slowly revising since April though so i'm definately doing it.  It sounds like you won't have an issue, as i'm sure the financial maths modules you did (MATH20912?) covered stuff like interest rate models, options, swaps, capital gains in fixed interest securities etc. As someone already said you may have an exemption, but i'm keen to take all the exams even if I could claim exemption (there could be something in the CT that wasn't covered on my course, or at least not from this particular angle).  I say go for it. It may not count for much, but it shows commitment and might give a little edge against a comparable graduate without it."

actuary,3daucw,Emtc2525,3,Tue Jul 14 21:03:43 2015 UTC,"Gotcha covered, mate. There are a couple of visualizations or tricks you can do to help on this.  First, I'm sure you've parsed ""equally likely to be any of the numbers 1,2,3...,m"" to mean that p(x) = 1/m and p(y) = 1/m. Good on you. But p(|X-Y|) =/= 1/m. So to figure this out, we'll choose an arbitrarily small m, like 3. You can do the arithmetic or make a table first, either way.    Y\X 1 2 3    1 0 1 2   2 1 0 1   3 2 1 0    So for m=3, E(|X-Y|) = (1/9)*(0+1+2 + 1+0+1 + 2+1+0) = 8/9.  You can repeat this for m=4 if you wish to deduce the pattern, but in a multiple choice environment, you can just plug 3 into the 5 options and see which one spits out 8/9 (and you may have to do m=4 or m=5 anyway).  For the ease of the reader, m=4, E(|X - Y|) = (1/16)*(0+1+2+3 + 1+0+1+2 + 2+1+0+1 + 3+2+1+0) = 5/4 = 20/16  So if you're clever, at this point you can realize that the probability will follow a pattern:  2/m2 -> m-1  4/m2 -> m-2  6/m2 -> m-3  ...  2(m-1)/m2 -> 1  m/m2 -> 0  Which naturally sums to an expected value of (m2 - 1)/3m.  (Just use the plug and chug method though, unless you're more clever than you are rote.)"

actuary,3daucw,Fred_Scuttle,2,Wed Jul 15 20:20:57 2015 UTC,Notice that your answer and the manuals answer are not the same for the easy case m=2.  You should be able to use this to at least see where you might be going wrong.  You could also use this to potentially rule out wrong answers and improve your guessing chance on the exam even if you couldn't figure it out.

I did the masters in actuary in UCD, so can give you a bit of insight into the course, cause we do all our CT subjects with the undergrads. The undergrad is good, it's gets you the 8 exemptions from ct1-ct8 and also ca1 which is the most difficult one. They start off with the easy cts in first year, and they do other subjects as well but I'm not sure which, but you can still have fun and not be totally consumed by study you do ct2 and 7. Second year is a litte tougher but still not too bad, ct1 and 3. Third year you do ct4 and six months placement and fourth year is the hardest by far, you do ct 5 6 and 8 and ca1, which are the hardest four of the lot.  You need to get As in all of your ct and ca exams to get the exemption. Now I did the 8 from ct1-8 in one year and got all the exemptions, so you should have no problem. You need to put in a good amount of work, but there seems to be a good class spirit in the years which is nice. A lot of people get jobs from their placement which is great! That experience is very valuable.   You do a lot of other stuff along the course as well, like linear algebra stats and excel courses, which can be useful. Excel probably the most important thing. The exams are much easier in college then the institute ones.  I can't say too much about working cause I have only research placement experience at the minute and I pretty much work on my own. It's good I like it. If you look online for salary it's gives pretty solid information. As a graduate you should expect to start on 30000 base, plus extra for your exemptions, and pay goes up with ever exam you pass. In comparison to other careers actuary is generally better pay, but most notably It goes up much faster than in other professions. A qualified actuary with 1 years experience (so about 4 years after college) can expect to be on 50-60k a year according to a recent salary survey conducted in Ireland. You can Google it and it should come up, 2014-2015. I don't have the link at the minute, I am on mobile.  I don't have any experience doing institute exams but from talking to people it's meant to be pretty horrible.

I was in one of the earlier calcs so I took a finance class and passed FM. After that/finishing calc I took a probability course and passed P. After that I thought I was statistically inclined and went straight for C. So for me FM -> P -> C -> MLC -> C.  Looks like most are due to the college load/courses at the time. All you need to know is P/FM are interchangable as first/second and MLC/MFE/C are interchangeable as third/fourth/fifth. P wont help you pass FM and vice versa, relatively independent. P and FM will both help you pass the latter three. But the latter three are roughly independent of each other. There are some mutual topics but they wouldn't help a ton."
actuary,3d385z,Humaetna,8,Mon Jul 13 16:15:11 2015 UTC,"The first four should be P, FM, MFE, and C (not necessarily in that order) now that MLC is (arguably) harder than C and doesn't give CAS credit. P before C, FM before MFE. Beyond that, it only really matters if you want to work around relevant coursework - e.g. take FM before P if you're taking second- or third-semester calc soon, C before MFE if you're taking diff. eq. soon, etc.  I've heard people argue that taking MFE immediately after FM or C right after P could be helpful, but in my opinion that wouldn't make much difference. At least in my case, all the overlapping material was what I remembered easily from the first two.  I personally did P -> FM -> C -> MFE. I took C before MFE partially because I wanted to have a third exam a little earlier in recruiting season (October vs. November), partially because I was taking a bunch of upper-level statistics courses that semester and wanted to take advantage of the overlap with C while that material was fresh in my mind, and partially because I wanted to make sure I passed C before I graduated and forgot a lot of that material entirely."

Those are the easiest, and great ways to get started in a particular branch of the industry. Then there should be a few other track-based tests depending on how well you did in the modules.  The big problems come up when studying for the Top Five. They are very difficult, much more difficult than the entry level ones I just mentioned. That's why you see so many questions about them! It's also why they're pretty cheap.   Of these, the easiest one is MLC. I recommend taking that first. It relies on a lot of memorization, but once you memorize your a symbols and s symbols, you should be good. Then comes C, which gives you good background knoeledge on statistical methods.  MFE is a lot more difficult, but the material is very useful to know for FM. FM gets to be pretty easy if you've figured out MFE.  Lastly, whatever you do, take P last. It is the peak of everything actuaries strive to know.  Do this, and you will have a very successful career ahead of you.  Edit: Don't listen to these trolls.

actuary,3d13bv,WhiteLightning10,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:47:10 2015 UTC,Thanks. I appreciate your answer.
actuary,3d13bv,heibochu,3,Sun Jul 12 17:57:55 2015 UTC,"1) I'd say experience and exams are looked at alot more, what degree you have would be last if the first two are lacking.  We also had two masters students as interns, underneath people with exams and experience with just bachelors.   2) See point 2. The market is flooded with people looking for entry levels.  I know with my line of work (group), we'd prefer you have strong tech (sql, programming experience, advanced excel).  3) DW Simpsons would be better telling you here, but I'd say you'll be awarded bonuses and raises if you get on a decent actuarial program.  That requires some experience or some great skills that can differentiate you.   Don't expect any negotiating power just because you passed a few exams."
actuary,3d13bv,heibochu,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:39:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Yes, I am not looking for negotiating power but at the same time I don't want to apply for a job with just 1 exam....and hence wanted to understand what is the right number of prelim exams to pass. Yes, I have good background in java programming and SQL, and now I am learning R, Python, and SAS. Any other software i should know that is specific to actuarial industry? Thanks."
actuary,3d13bv,heibochu,3,Sun Jul 12 18:53:24 2015 UTC,"On your 1st point about exams... getting your foot through the door would be most important than anything.  A candidate's marketing power increases dramatically with some solid actuarial experience and credentials.  I know areas in my company that lost people who found desirable opportunities immediately after their associate's.  So I'd say, don't be concerned so much on what you'll start out with.  You'll have a ton of options once you have the letters next to your name, to the point that recruiters will be calling you about opportunities that are available out there.  For your 2nd point, MS Office Excel.  Know your way around a spreadsheet and ways to quickly get things done with shortcuts.  If your knowledge with R, Python, or whatnot involve integrating with Excel, then you'd be seen as a tech guru, at least in my area."
actuary,3d13bv,musicalspoons,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:41:01 2015 UTC,"Good. Yes, I would like to get my foot in the door. And for this I am also open to internships. Besides this reddit and the usual job websites, are there any other places where internship openings are posted? Thanks for your feedback. I appreciate it."
actuary,3d13bv,azim40,2,Sun Jul 12 19:51:51 2015 UTC,"Contacting recruiters like DW Simpson's and Pryor's would be useful for information.  I've seen postings on the Actuarial Outpost forum as well.  If you decide to go back to school with an actuarial science master program, your school should have some information and career events.  I'm thinking internships maybe limited to strictly college students, but don't quote me on that.  Good luck."
actuary,3d13bv,azim40,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:36:45 2015 UTC,Got it. Thanks for giving me helpful tips.
actuary,3d13bv,MindYourQsandPs,2,Sun Jul 12 21:14:29 2015 UTC,"Other people should correct me if I'm wrong, but the most useful part of your master's will probably be the internship you get after the first year. Experience and connections are so important."

actuary,3d13bv,eapocalypse,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:46:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Just curious, as an actuary in a management role what percentage of your time do you spend doing actual actuarial work versus management work (managing teams, projects etc.)? What were your reasons to move into management?"

actuary,3d2y0y,ActuariallyNeedsHelp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:42:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't just apply to actuarial internships. I also applied, and interviewed, for internships in underwriting, finance, and data analysis. I got into the top 3 in a couple of them, but was never the top pick."
actuary,3d2y0y,ActuariallyNeedsHelp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:57:07 2015 UTC,"Like another person said, you're kind of limited to data analyst jobs right now. You're better off looking at those then trying to look at actuarial internships/EL jobs. Just study for the exams you can now."
actuary,3d2y0y,watersign,2,Mon Jul 13 16:51:53 2015 UTC,"data analyst jobs kinda suck but some are cool..but they are good jobs for younger people and if you get some experience and get a few exams under your belt,your acturial career can get started."
actuary,3d2y0y,broskiumenyiora,2,Mon Jul 13 17:38:32 2015 UTC,"¿Porque no los dos?  I graduated college with a degree in math and economics. I spent my first 2.5 years after college working as a data analyst and studying for exams. I, personally, didn't enjoy the data analyst job (though a lot of that may have just been the company), but I did learn some excel and SQL which helped a lot in my job hunt. Luckily, I had enough time outside of work to study and I passed P and FM in my time as a data analyst. Then I just started emailing actuaries all over the place. I used SOA explorer.... It's a google maps type thing on the SOA's website that lists all the registered actuaries in any given area and sometimes their contact info. Cold emailing works waaaay better than applications in my experience. I just recently got a job as an actuary and so far, I really enjoy it. It's not exciting, but it's pretty chill, which suits me well.  TL;DR you may have better luck starting as a data analyst and working on exams. Pass 2, then start looking."
actuary,3d2y0y,ActuariallyInclined,2,Mon Jul 13 03:33:45 2015 UTC,How do you not have any exams done? All those big Midwest schools seem to have test related classes if you're focusing on actuarial.
actuary,3d0vnu,NowAnActuary,2,Sun Jul 12 16:14:14 2015 UTC,"Hey there, NowAnActuary, I'm sitting for MFE tomorrow and I understand your confusion on these questions. I don't really know a clear cut way to do it so everytime one comes up I figure it out by looking at what's given.   For example, say you long 100 calls, that means you are spending money to buy 100 calls. Write that down.  Then you delta hedge it, delta will be positive meaning you sell stocks if you buy the calls (for puts delta is negative and if you buy the put you buy the call). So Stock Price times Delta is how much you spend in this example with the 100 calls. Write that number down. The net cost is the amount you borrow/lend (when you buy calls you're lending because the stocks you sold greatly outweigh the cost of the calls).  Now overnight you're going to get 1 days (1/365) worth of continuously compounded interest on what was borrowed/lent. Because here this is positive you now have this much on the second day.   So next compute how much the entire position is worth on the second day. Take the total amount you have from lending on the first day, add it to the new price of stocks multiplied by the amount of shares you sold (100*deltacall) which is negative this time because you're essentially buying them back, then add the 100 calls times the new call value because you're essentially selling them back. Now you see your total sum of cash on the second day and that is the profit.  Alternatively, you can just combine interest from what was borrowed/lent with the change in stock price times numbers of stocks owned/sold and change in call price times calls sold/bought.  Signs can be determined because this is profit so if you buy something make it negative because you're paying out that money and if you sell something make it positive because you're getting that money.  Hope this helps! Might be a little convoluted but I tried! Back to Adapt practice exams for me."
actuary,3d0vnu,XelaProductions,2,Sun Jul 12 16:31:34 2015 UTC,That second to last sentence is what gets me though. That is how I thought of it logically but the solutions say buying is a positive and selling is a negative.
actuary,3d0vnu,lynix,3,Sun Jul 12 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"I took MFE in March.  It eventually clicked for me when I just stopped trying to do it whichever way the manuals described with positive and negatives, and just kept it all straight while doing the problem (ie: interest is a cost, buy put is cost, etc) and then at the end if you've got more costs than gains you pick your sign.  Essentially, do all the math then reason the sign after you've got each piece that goes into the overnight profit."
actuary,3d0vnu,BlakesaBAMF,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:10:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. I passed MFE Friday and once i started writing ""spent $X"" and ""receive $X"" instead of worrying about +/-, they became extremely easy problems"

You can do so here: https://www.actuaries.org.uk/user 3) Acted are the supplier of notes for the UK exams. The notes contain the core reading (set by the ifoa) and extra reading and questions to help you understand them. I'd recommend you get the acted notes tbh.  4) you'll need to enter by the 10th August, according to the important dates section of the student website. 5) Pass. Better to enter for the exams early and let the faculty worry about that.   Good luck!"

actuary,3czadu,geocur1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:31:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely no to the objective, and to using an online resume builder (use a Word or Google Docs template instead). Including a summary can be useful for the sake of copying keywords from the job description to help get through HR's automated filters, but it's not totally necessary."
actuary,3czadu,tf113,0,Sun Jul 12 14:39:49 2015 UTC,"No, you shouldn't. The best advice I can give you is rather than use a third-party source to get your resume to  potential employers, why not just build a resume and email it yourself? You're an entry level candidate, let's be be real; you have no clear objective besides starting your career; using a third party source just makes you look lazy and incompetent.   Build your own resume the way you want it and email it to any and all hiring employers. Feel confident in the fact that actuaries are in demand and the supply is minimal. As an entry level candidate you shouldn't be using a third party source to do the tedious work for you."
actuary,3czadu,tetrology,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:06:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help! I just wanted to make sure what I should be including. What the summary does do is beef up the amount of words on my resume since I have only had 1 internship (not actuarial, more accounting) but if it shouldn't be on there I obviously will not include it. I will have my 2nd exam passed come the middle of August and graduate in December so I'm thinking the sooner I start applying, the better."
actuary,3czadu,tf113,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:55:19 2015 UTC,"actuaries are in demand and the supply is minimal   Some fields have it worse, but there are something like 3-4 job seekers per EL opening. I wouldn't call that minimal."
actuary,3czadu,tetrology,2,Sun Jul 12 14:32:05 2015 UTC,"I know I exaggerated, and it depends on location, of course, but the fact of the matter is that entry level actuaries fare off much better than many if not most fields. The exams are complex and difficult and the reality is that  there's only so many individuals that can handle that route, and that keeps the supply low."

actuary,3cub3j,cornbreadpandapants,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:10:49 2015 UTC,got it. Would you just stick to the TIA mapping cheat sheet and read the appropriate source material prior to the videos and problems? Did you utilize the TIA's PDF study guides at all since you already read the source material? How many weeks did you prep for; TIA suggests 18.  Thanks for the insight!
actuary,3cub3j,pinball777,2,Fri Jul 10 23:20:41 2015 UTC,Usually I like to read the material that is for the upcoming video then watch video and do questions.

I prepped for the 4/27 exam starting the second to last week of December, so...about 18 weeks.  The biggest factor for 5, imo, is practicing under real exam conditions (when you get to the practice exam stage).  Write out your answers & time yourself.  When grading, be conservative."

I would say the trickiest thing to learn for the exam would be calculating the expected values of weird derivative stocks (or similar).   There's an ADAPT problem in particular that comes to mind asking to find the expected value of something like (S(1) + S(2) + S(3))1/3. You have to do all sorts of fun algebraic manipulation to get it into a form that you can apply m and v2 to (which are previously derived from some sort of Brownian motion differential equation or something). Then you have to plug everything in correctly to get the new parameters.  If you had asked me to do something like that after going through the unit that actually goes over this material, I wouldn't have been able to tell you how to do it, at least up until a few days ago.  Nothing like this came up on the exam though."

actuary,3clyz0,EK22,3,Wed Jul 8 23:07:21 2015 UTC,"I'll give it a try: conditional distribution:  gives the probabilities contingent upon the values of the other variables  marginal distribution: distribution without reference to the value of the other variable  In a multivariate distribution, the most common case is two random variables, each with its own distribution (i.e. bernoulli, binomial, geometric, negative binomial, poisson, or uniform continuous, normal, exponential, and gamma)  Now, unlike single variate distribution, where you have one input and the distribution returns a probability, in multivariate distribution, two values (most commonly x,y) are inputs and they return one probability. Meaning each point on an area field has a corresponding probability associated with it. That's why when you are calculating the CDF, you are doing a double intergral (essentially adding up all the probability that each point on the surface returns).  With marginal distribution, f(x), it is giving the individual probability distribution of just x. It gives the probabilities of various values of the variables in the subset without reference to the values of the other variables.   For Conditional distribution, it is probability distribution of Y when X is known to be a particular value. That is why to find the conditional distribution, often f(x,y)/(f(x) is used. f(x) refers to the marginal distribution of x while f(x,y) is the joint distribution.   Knowing the conditional distribution and marginal distribution will allow you to calculate expected value, variance, or any other parameters of the probability distribution.   I know this is very broad but I have to go and will be back. Please if you need any help, more specific questions will be better."

I'd heard that some companies wouldn't ""accept"" the credits and would prefer you sit for the actual exam, but there wasn't anything to back this up.   I currently have P, FM, MFE, and C, and rather than writing MLC (which I'm hesitant to if I end up goign the CAS route) I was wondering if I should just go for the ""free"" credit.  Also I thought your experiences would be helpful to take back to share with some of the other younger students at my school as possible alternatives to grinding exams out."
actuary,3cklqu,mathtuary,2,Wed Jul 8 17:22:01 2015 UTC,"The CIA has really promoted it. I suspect it hasn't really taken off. The entry level market in Canada is extremely crowded so receiving an ""exemption"" or ""free"" credit as you call it vs. an exam pass probably doesn't set you apart from other candidates in a positive light. Also note that it's not recognized by the SOA so you will not get an ASA or FSA if you participate in this program."

The students transfer their credits to a corresponding British school and get exemptions for the British exam. From there, they once again do a transfer to the SOA for an exam exemption. That is my high-level understanding and I could be wrong as I have not really fact checked.   In terms of recruitment, my company has taken a stance that if it is accepted by the CIA, we will also accept it.

Since CAS is taking out their MLC exam I would advise you not to bother paying for the MLC credit, since you would be one exam short of your FSA if you do life, or have wasted your money if you do P & C. If you decide to do SOA or get hired at a life company you really should just write MLC . It is tough but if you have taken a course you will be okay. It also looks good on a resume, and gives you a good intro to long answer type exams.  According to the CIA, who gave a presentation on it, they did a survey and according to it employers do not care, as long as you have the general qualifications they are looking for (grades, exams/credits, experience...) . Seems to be the same attitude from people that are actually in recruitment positions when I have talked to them. However a lot of my coworkers that did not have this option seem to be pretty mad about it, though they could be upset because they all had to suffer through the exams. I personally feel it depends on the employer whether or not they will care, though keep in mind the exams show that you can balance that extra work on top of school and life, and that you are committed to the profession since you have put the time in and know what it takes to pass exams."

Managers don't teach their underlings how to use R because most managers don't know R. I myself have to teach my manager how to use R.

actuary,3cjiab,eriktheguy,3,Wed Jul 8 14:23:58 2015 UTC,"Here are some of the ways I've used vba macros in the workplace:  We had a tool that we used regularly in our workplace that we were required to run several times around valuation time. We would input the name of a particular file and the model would read the input data and output the valuation results. This was repeated between 125 and 150 times and it was done manually.  Many of the input files were similar, but not identical. They would combine different sensitivity tests in different combinations. So, I made a macro to automate setting up the input files.  The model (for reasons unknown to me) required the user to enter a captcha every 5 times that it was run. So, it wasn't possible to queue up several runs to go overnight. I used vba to take a screenshot, OCR the text, figure out the captcha and enter it into the input box, so that it was possible to effectively bypass the captcha and queue runs to go overnight.  Our models output several excel files that needed to be combined into a single summary file. I automated this so it was no longer a manual process.   VBA is more flexible than excel and so, a lot of models will use VBA to some degree for their calculations.  The short answer to your question is ""both""."

VBA's a crappy language in a lot of ways, but I think it's a great first language in that you can do useful things with it right off the bat (instead of that ""print a Christmas tree made of asterisks to the console using for loops"" crap) and it's an easy way to introduce OOP concepts. Then again, maybe my first-semester programming class just sucked.  Don't get me wrong, I'll be ecstatic if I can jump right into a role using R and never touch VBA again, but within the actuarial field (and at EL at that) that's pretty much a pipe dream."

Think frequency and severity. The frequency increases because now there are small claims below the threshold - but not as many as you expect because some people won't claim for small stuff. Think about what these claims might be and guess a frequency. No think about severity, all the 'large claims' are now bigger by the excess amount. The average severity will be a  weighted average of {freq(small)xclaims(small) +freq(large)x[claims(large)+excess]} divided by total frequency. If you don't want to think about what is happening/driving cost in the excess layer, a crude method is just take successive cuts of the mean and standard deviation using 'as if excesses', then just extrapolate the curves to excess = 0 i.e. {y,x}={Mean(excess),excess} - generally the curve looks like 1/ax so it heads off to a big number when x=0, you will have to use judgment  about when you take your tangent as the curve actually tends to flatten out closer to the $0 excess (as no-one makes $5 claims)"

You could just call up a repairer and ask them how much work they do for under $500  Alternatively just use competitor quotes (who have options for low excesses) to understand the likely loss cost below your current excess.  Using claims above the excess to inform losses below the excess is always going to be an extrapolation at best. If you think about what is driving small claims, it can be quite different from what is driving large claims - so it big claims do not provide useful information"

I manually adjusted the levels to 7 or 8, never bothered about my 'true' level. I suggest you do the same. When you're comfortable with level 7/8 questions, there should be higher chances of passing. If you're unsure whether you should do the quizzes, look at the weight of the topic in the syllabus. If it's like 5-10%, maybe just skim over? Personally never really paid attention to interest rate theory, and just focused on other parts."
actuary,3chw3b,ticky_tocky,3,Wed Jul 8 02:59:57 2015 UTC,"Do quizzes starting at level 1 with the notes next to you.  If you get more than 70% right, go up a level or to and repeat.  If you get less than 70%, do the same level.  And perhaps most importantly, for questions that you get wrong, WRITE OUT THE STEPS of the solution and see exactly how to do the problem.

Few comments:   The market performance bit is a little difficult to use and doesn't account for a reduction in risky assets as one ages. Do you account for catch-up contributions? Or, like the other guy said, that people will contribute more as they get older. Are you factoring in taxes? Why does the ""Uncertainty Test"" ignore the below median outcomes? Does this assume no Social Security or Pension?   I think you have some of this functionality, it's just hard to get to since you have to keep clicking back and forth."

Also, I think whatever number you are entering as your ""contribution per year"" doesn't stop after retirement when I think it should.  Edit: Nvm it does stop after retirement, It just seems like it doesn't because the threshold at which your money ""lasts forever"" is close to where ret. income = yearly contribution"

actuary,3cent3,Shynedown,3,Tue Jul 7 09:11:12 2015 UTC,"I would guess that for you, getting an internship would be pretty difficult and possibly unnecessary.   Certainly it would help you to find a job, but your challenge is to craft your existing skills, which seem multitude, into a package that is obviously useful and attractive in this new setting.  If you find one, I suspect it is likely to be through personal connections.  Which, actually, wouldn't be a bad way to find a job either, if you can come up with connections to people who understand the value of your experience.  I saw an employer panel at a teaching conference last week, and on that basis I would suggest:  1. As a career changer, you may need three exams.    This is more a proof of dedication than job training.  Depends, again, on how attractive you can make your other skills.  Certainly start looking hard for jobs after 2, and feel free to try even now or after your first exam is passed. 2. Learn about the actuarial profession.   Understand as much as you can about the different activities and projects that actuaries work on in different kinds of companies.  This will help you to confirm your decision and to respond intelligently to interview questions.  Goes to expressing how you personally will be valuable to your employer.   Lots of people pass exams, but not so many (none?) have your experiences in health care, your ability to explain technical things to people with no technical background, etc. 3. You are right to add technical skills.  VBA is probably number 1, but that may vary depending on employer/position.  I would consider adding an understanding of the R statistical software/language as well.  You could consider seeing if your local library has access to learning tree or lynda.com or something like that, or use Coursera, etc.  Also, we have a technical skills course that people seem to really like: http://www.theinfiniteactuary.com/skills  The differentiators that the panelists mentioned were:  Predictive Analytics Communication Skills Excell/VBA/R/Programming ""Do I want to work with this person?"" Initiative & Leadership Volunteerism  Prepare yourself to not get discouraged if this process takes some time.   The panel indicated that there is a significant need for more ASAs and FSAs, but that the number of candidates for entry level positions far outnumbers the number of positions available.  This means that once you do get through the door, you will have a great opportunity to grow your career.  Good luck!"

Also, I don't think that companies expect entry level candidates to ""have"" predictive analytics, but it was mentioned as something that would differentiate a candidate from the crowd.   PA was mentioned at various times during the meeting as something that is of growing importance to the field.  There were a number of college faculty in the audience that were saying that their students were having trouble finding a job with two exams and an internship because there are so many candidates that have those qualifications now, and the differentiators came as a response to that."

Even with a math degree, I feel my age will be a hurtle for an entry level position.  I still have possibilities in the current  industry I work, and have a willingness to pursue that if I'm disappointed too many times over with the Actuarial field.  A person at the university I attend has passed two exams, the P and FM, and has recommended that the speed at which you are able to complete problems is a big factor.

actuary,3cdbl7,hiltyhilt,2,Tue Jul 7 00:51:44 2015 UTC,"Ultimately it doesn't matter too much, as long as you are consistent. The convention is outflows are negative and inflows are positive.  In your example it isn't completely clear, but you could look at it that you are someone paying upfront for the annuity and receiving a payment of 1000 per year. In this case, the payments would each be +1000 because you are receiving the annuity payments.  Or you could look at it as you are a company paying out the annuity  to someone. In this case the payments each would be -1000 and the value you are solving for is the upfront payment from the client, which will be a positive cash flow."

actuary,3cdbl7,lametown_poopypants,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:29:16 2015 UTC,"Another spin.    You're telling the machine that you want 10 years of payments at 5% interest.  Since you want to know the value of the payments and only them, you have to assume that the future value of them is zero.  Now you're left with the PV and payments to enter.  The calculator won't be smart enough to give you a reasoned answer that you're looking for as in what's the present value since we know it's positive as well as the payments, but will know how to do math.    If you enter a positive payment, it will give you a negative PV so that as you make $1000 payments the PV will increase to zero at the 10th year.  The converse is true as well so if you enter a -$1000 payment each payment will decrease the PV to zero at the 10th year."

actuary,3c99fr,Boredatwork1324,2,Mon Jul 6 02:50:55 2015 UTC,"The death spiral shouldn't occur so long as the pricing actuaries are using a reasonable methodology.

actuary,3c99fr,Boredatwork1324,3,Wed Jul 8 00:22:04 2015 UTC,"Does the 3:1 rate band get pretty much all of the blame here, or are there other major factors?"
actuary,3c99fr,tf113,9,Mon Jul 6 03:50:05 2015 UTC,"No, not all to blame though certainly a piece of the puzzle.  Guaranteed Issue is the bigger problem, along with Rx.  The health exchanges started in 2014 and insurers did not have any real data on which to base the utilization of the newly insured, especially since GI had never happened on this scale before.  2015 rates were due before any credible data had been collected on the 2014 business.  Now that we have at least a year of data to work with, insurers are realizing they are underpriced, hence rate increase.  Also, pharmaceutical trend is spiking.  I won't pretend I am unbiased here, but Rx is largely unregulated and can do whatever the hell they want.  What irks me is this:   If commissioners do their job and actively review rates, he said, “my expectation is that they’ll come in significantly lower than what’s being requested.”   Like he expects all the health insurers are secretly all against him or something.  The purpose of the commissioner is to be sure insurance companies stay solvent so the state doesn't have to take them over - Obama's statement is in complete contradiction of this."
actuary,3c99fr,MustSeeReason,5,Mon Jul 6 04:28:15 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't put too much on the 3:1 band, since this isn't the first year it's in effect. Also, rate increases are high in states like NY, where age rating isn't allowed.  There's a belief going around that many carriers, especially many co-op's, may have priced too aggressively for 2014. Many of these insurers gained high market share, but if your product is underpriced then a high number of members only hurts you that much faster.  High increases this year may be due to these carriers seeing their full CY-14 results, having a better idea of what to expect from the 3 R's, and realizing they need to hike up prices in order to catch up.  I'm sure there are many other factors, but this is the one that sticks out most in my mind."
actuary,3c99fr,byram,3,Mon Jul 6 04:20:59 2015 UTC,"While they're not exactly small, rate increases in NY seem like they're quite a bit lower than those given in the posted article. And while the 3:1 band has been around for a few years, the marketplace hasn't; I'd still guess that companies expected an influx in young, healthy enrollees when the marketplace launched, and that that didn't happen. I'm looking for data on that now.  I've heard the same thing about aggressive pricing for 2014, though. Hopefully that's a more significant factor and rate increases taper off in the future."
actuary,3c99fr,tf113,2,Mon Jul 6 04:50:36 2015 UTC,"What isn't captured here is two pieces:  1) everyone was guessing at rates for 2014 and now they have some actual experience. There is the phenomenon that the lowest rated insurers are taking the biggest increases to get back to market average rates. Under pricing 2014 was a legitimate strategy going into 2014 and then take it back over time.  2) transitional relief whereby ""if you like your plan you can keep it"" has created anti selective markets in the Exchanges.  The market hasn't stabilized yet and once the risk pool settles well know more about what rates should actually look like"
actuary,3c9bus,Sengirvyr,3,Mon Jul 6 02:38:42 2015 UTC,Let's not beat around the bush here. What is your GPA and do you need sponsorship?  I'm an also UT grad (2014) with a shitty GPA and I decided to take the exams after graduation. I passed 3 in 6 months and soon after found a job in Dallas. I had no problem getting interviews for out of state as well and I didn't even have a math degree.
actuary,3c9bus,cowboomboom,2,Tue Jul 7 13:23:33 2015 UTC,"Good idea mentioning a sponsorship.  OP should definitely consider reaching out to former classmates, teachers, alumni, etc... on LinkedIn or Facebook to see how other UT students are faring in their new actuarial careers.  If you keep in touch, then they can think of you when their companies begin hiring.  Worst case scenario: they ignore you; best case: you get an interview.    Very few of the young actuaries I work with had their resumes picked off the top of a stack.  They mostly knew people that shared their resumes with the right person and helped them get their foot in the door."

Are you limiting yourself geographically? Have you had any interviews? Are you skilled with Excel, Access, SQL and the like? It seems strange that with three exams you haven't had any luck. It makes me suspect that there is something else going on here. Maybe your resume and/or cover letter are setting off red flags? Maybe you need to work on your interviewing skills?  Do you know anyone in the industry? Sometimes it just takes getting your foot in the door to make an impression. If I were you, I'd look at getting a position at a large insurance company in underwriting or something. You would be in a position to interact with other actuaries and to show them that you are a knowledgeable, hard-working person."

It might take another exam and a year of unrelated work, but it's certainly possible to get an entry-level job without an internship and with a bad GPA.  You should get some sort of job.  A temp agency could probably get you a job next week.  I think its important to do this.  It shows that you want to work, can work, and it gives you something to say in interviews."

I was also told (by the same recruiter) to look for an internship (not sure how to go about doing that since I graduated over a year ago).  I'm not sure why people talking about ""career changers"" when it seems like companies DEMAND that you have an internship.

I think you should start sending out CVs to a lot of companies, that is how I landed my internships in the past 2 summers, and I guess this strategy could work for finding entry level job. But since you have a low GPA, I am guessing you are facing difficulties in passing the initial recruitment stages.   Recruiters write you off completely after listening to your GPA for entry level jobs, so you should come up with a really good story about why you have a low GPA, and support yourself as a candidate by telling them why you are good despite the low GPA.   Hope that helps. All you need to do is land an interview, and impress the hell out of the recruiter."

actuary,3c78h8,smthsmth,0,Mon Jul 6 02:54:17 2015 UTC,"Not 100% on this. Still reviewing.  The way I remember it is that dS/S is Geometric Brownian motion and akin to the lognormal distribution.   The lognormal distribution has a mean of eα-δ.   α-δ is also the drift term in front of dt in the dS/S differential equation for Geometric Brownian.  To assign any sort of probability to the Lognormal Distribution, you must first obtain the median of the Standard Normal Distribution. Aka, you must subtract .5σ2 from α-δ in order to obtain (α-δ-.5σ2 ).  This is equivalent to subtracting .5σ2 from the dS/S term in Geometric Brownian. Which is also the process you use when converting from a Geometric Brownian to a Arithmetic Brownian.   In short, Geometric Brownian is lognormal, and therefore will have α-δ as its drift term. And Arithmetic Brownian is normal and therefore will have (α-δ-.5σ2 ) as its drift term."

actuary,3c6buo,suvasia,2,Mon Jul 6 05:36:31 2015 UTC,Nice to know and Mannion seems like a really cool guy. I just need to email him about textbooks and stuff and everything should be settled regarding that-btw notes would be great-Anything to get me through the year. Can't wait to meet you guys and thanks for all the advice!
actuary,3c6buo,rab7,2,Tue Jul 7 06:57:33 2015 UTC,"If you worked your ass off to get in,  you probably already have a good enough work ethic to have continued success in college.   Don't worry about being in the 2/3 that drop out. Just do what you do.  Edited to add: Your biggest issue at first will be adjusting from high school life to college life,  which really isn't so bad and takes maybe a week or two to get used to. But once you get it figured out, your good work ethic will let everything else come together."
actuary,3c6buo,Dunno_dont_care,2,Sun Jul 5 07:25:22 2015 UTC,Hopefully and yeah I've heard the biggest struggle and adjustment to college life is just getting used to everything and not the courses itself. I beleive I'm an independent individual so I should be fine on that aspect in regards for taking care of myself in college and thank you for the optimistic outlook.
actuary,3c6buo,ExceLestial,2,Mon Jul 6 02:38:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was already looking into Gamma Iota Sigma because well they're a risk management fraternity. And do you think I should switch over to the 4 year program then? Not going to lie, St. John's is a little expensive and if I could knock a year out-that would be awesome. I'm also assuming you have already graduated from the university-so how did you like the program?  I didn't expect a St.John's fellow in this subreddit so this was really cool and thanks for any info. Sorry to berate you with so many questions btw, I'm extremely curious."
actuary,3c6buo,nycixc,2,Sun Jul 5 13:23:56 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly enough, I'm actually at SJU right now (going to start my sophomore year in the fall), and I already passed my first exam (Exam P). Gamma is a fantastic organization for networking and whatnot (I'm fairly close with the whole e-board), and the Actuarial Club (who I'm also very close with) is also fantastic for getting prepped for the exams with their study groups. You do get prepped a lot in the classes for each exam, but there is a lot of study time on your own that you need to commit to. The difference between passing and failing the exams comes down, basically, to how much time you put in. Luckily, at SJU, there's a ton of great places on campus to get some quiet study time in. If not your dorm room, the library is always very quiet, there are quiet study rooms throughout campus, and you can always just hang out on the lawn if that gives you a better study environment. I'm very happy in the program, and there's a lot of great people in it. Feel free to let me know if you have any other questions!"
actuary,3c6buo,nycixc,2,Sun Jul 5 19:13:32 2015 UTC,"Wow in your first year? That's freakn awesome! I will definitely be looking at Gamma and joining the Actuary club btw and I definitely will devote myself to studying, but not to a point where my social life is nonexistant and yeah, one of the things I asked my orientation leaders is places people study because I cannot study in my dorm unless it's late into the evening. Thanks for the help and nice to talk to another St. John fellow!"

I had 30mins before the tour actually started and waited at the welcome center. In the welcome center there were all sorts of pamphlets...etc... and I came across one for actuarial science in St. Johns and how they offered a special five year program to students who had ""strong credentials"" (didn't specify what counted as strong credentials). I applied for the 5 year program on common app I believe and that's about all I know.

actuary,3c6buo,cac2008,2,Mon Jul 6 02:36:53 2015 UTC,"I'm the Public Relations Officer for the Actuarial Club at Saint John's University, and an upcoming sophomore.   The community of actuaries and the program here at Saint John's are excellent. You definitely need to study hard, but you have plenty of older students who want to see you do well. If you have a good work ethic and get involved with the Actuarial Club and Gamma Iota Sigma on campus, you will be absolutely fine. Fair warning, some of the University Calculus teachers aren't the greatest (particularly Gerber).  And at Saint John's, don't look at the other 2/3 as ""dropping out"", rather, look at them as becoming very successful Risk Management majors. It may seem like a demotion, but our school has such a great program and so many connections that there will always be plenty of opportunity for success.   Let me know if you have any questions :)"

Everyone is actually that pleasant haha that spooked me a little as a freshman too, but it's easy to get used to. As for Mannion, he is easily the greatest calculus professor I ever had. So long as you show up to class and do your work, you'll be fine (this goes for the majority of other classes, too). If you took AP Calc in high school, his class will be even easier for you."
actuary,3c6buo,sozzZ,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:51:23 2015 UTC,Couldn't fit calc ap into my schedule unfortunately it was either take 2 aps (calc/english) or take 4 (stats/english/spanish/psychology) so I took option 2 with the 4aps and I've loved all 4 of those classes.

actuary,3c6n7u,cac2008,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:50:36 2015 UTC,Don't forget SQL!  Good luck with two-three weeks.....I'm not sure people will take too kindly to that IMO  First option sounds the best tbh
actuary,3c6n7u,DLies,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:44:50 2015 UTC,"It seems everyone is in agreement that the cut-down internship would be a bad idea, instead I'm going to try and arrange work experience and hopefully make some contacts at the time.  Thanks again for the advice re. SQL. I've only a basic knowledge of it that I could do with improving.   Thanks for the advice!"
actuary,3c6n7u,actuarys,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:30:54 2015 UTC,"I think that the statistics options would be better if you're looking to gain exemptions. Even if they don't give you exemptions, I think they'll be the most useful when it comes to work and exams, as a lot of the first stage of exams are to do with statistics, finance, accounting and economics. You'll still need maths, but they it shouldn't be more complicated than A-Level/first year uni maths. By all means, take those modules if you're interested in them, I'm just telling you what would be more appropriate for the actuarial exams.  With regards to developing skills, I think VBA is a good one. I use SAS a lot, so you may want to look into that. I've heard SQL is also popular with actuaries, so that's another one to consider. Definitely gain an understanding of the different areas actuaries work in. Do you have a preference which field you go into i.e. life insurance, general insurance, pensions? Also learn the different areas within each of these fields i.e. pricing, reserving, capital modelling. One bit of advice I got when applying was that, for entry level positions, most firms don't really care about what technical skills you have, as these can be learnt on the job. It's more about the other skills you have i.e. communication, people skills, and generally what kind of person you are i.e. are you someone that would get on well with others, are you genuinely interested in the career etc. Obviously it helps if you have some technical skills, but they shouldn't be all you focus on. Are there any relevant societies at your university? You don't have to be the president or anything, just being an active member shows your enthusiasm.  I think getting an internship for 2-3 weeks might be tough. You could always ask for work experience instead for a week or so. As well as applying for graduate schemes, join recruitment agencies, as they'll inform you of vacancies you wouldn't hear of otherwise.  Best of luck with your degree and job search."
actuary,3c6n7u,u38cg,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:14:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! Interesting that everyone thinks the same about the reduced internship, instead I'll take your advice about work experience.  I still need to do a bit more in-depth analysis of the different areas, but from what I've seen so far reserving takes my fancy.  Unfortunately there aren't any relevant societies: it's a college which specialises in mature students, so societies are few and far between. Maybe I'll start one..."
actuary,3c6n7u,u38cg,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:14:04 2015 UTC,"The first option will definitely be the most directly applicable, and may earn you an exemption or at least make the studying much simpler.  It won't make that much difference to an employer though, so if you have a a good reason for preferring another stream, you'll never be in a better position to study it.  I think some knowledge of numerical analysis is a good thing to have simply to know the issues that can arise.  Don't go too far down the rabbithole of learning everything about programming.  I don't think it would be much of an exaggeration to say employers would prefer you did a menial customer service role and did well at it than became an expert on VBA.  Also, most interviewers were promoted to their current position because they didn't know the difference between SQL and VBA and they're not going to take kindly to having you explain the difference :p  Have you considered the sandwich year option?  Getting one of these is a lot of work but they are well paid, excellent experience and more of ten than not lead to a solid job offer.  As an aside, I got an entry-level position after an Act Sci degree as a mature student, so it can certainly be done.  Good luck!"

actuary,3c5tf7,sozzZ,2,Sun Jul 5 18:48:41 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you're applying for. I've had a lot more success in cold emailing people saying, ""hey, here's my github, is there anything there that you'd want to hire me for?"", than trying to apply online through HR.  It helps later in your career, when you run into other actuaries who actually know what github is, and you can use it accordingly. That way you aren't shooting randomly with the emails. I also have a generic, easy-to-read website for people who are unfamiliar with github."

Yes, maybe you get stuck working late from time to time (quarter end for life insurance, rate filings for health), I don't think it's as black and white as your chief actuary is purporting. At my company all the FSAs are family folks, including the chief.  I think your chief actuaries words are not specific to actuarial. You can get ahead in any career by neglecting your social life and working 70 hours a week and caring more about your job than anything else. Some folks want that.  Unless he means exams.

actuary,3c004l,cowboomboom,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:00:38 2015 UTC,"Do you mind PMing me the name of your firm? Anyways, actuarial salaries are mostly driven by successful exam progress. Most students will be MIA the weeks leading up to their exam, some people in your lives will not understand the effort/dedication it takes to pass these exams. I am seeing a lot of new ASAs who graduated only 18 months ago. There are kids out there becoming FSAs 2 years after graduation. You don't need to put your life on hold for forever. Pass your exams quickly and you can carry on with your life. Passing all your exams quickly shows that you are hard working and detail oriented. By and large, the kids who have had the fastest exam progress are also the ones moving into management positions. The actuaries who stop after 2-4 exams are the ones stuck in a cubicle with 20+ yrs exp. Trust me, pass your exams. Lawyers, investment bankers, private equity analysts, doctors, and management consults pretty much give up their first couples years of their working life and work insane 80+ hour weeks. As actuaries we need to study our asses off, I think it is reasonable."

I did university courses on the material like you did, and I did not do a single practice exam or use ADAPT. I literally just made sure I knew and understood the material and understood the different variety of questions. I got a preliminary pass of FM on the June sitting.   You should still be doing practice questions if you do not do adapt. Lots of them. Aside from that, good luck with whatever you choose to do!  ps if you want ASM 10th edition PDF pm me"

I think it covers everything adequately but he probably just didn't want to go through the hassle of including something that could be easily referenced else where. The hardest integrals I recall doing for P were by-parts integration that got a little messy for 1st and 2nd moments. That was more about staying organized than knowing integrals for me."

Adapt is a practice test system that does a good job of assessing your readiness to pass the exam. The levels are associated with that process.  The factors in the decision to get Adapt are: 1) What is the pressure to pass? Are you a 15 year old trying to prove you're smart? or Are you supporting a family and will be kicked out of the exam program?  2) Can you afford it? 3) How many practice problems have you done? Do you get them right? Can you do a problem in 4 minutes and get it right? Adapt can help with that.  You can also do it with an egg timer and the SOA sample questions.  The advantage of Adapt is that you have a reputable 2nd opinion of how ready you are.  Some people can reproduce that confidence on their own."

Finish studying as quickly as you can and hit up the practice problems, do as many as you can. If you go through the SOA problems and the ACTEX exams and are feeling confident you should do fine.

I wasn't comfortable with Ito's Lemma/GBM until I took several quizzes on them.  General advice for any actuarial exam is read each question again after you solve the problem.

If you have study days left (or just have the day off in general), try to get two practice tests per day at the end, and during the practice problem phase try to do a half day of problems and then a practice test at the end of the day. Good luck  *edit I really would try to be comfortable with adapt level 5-6 by the end. I've found that's a good predictor of exam difficulty.

Also, maybe center your name and contact info, make it look neater."

In talking to interviewers at the company I intern for, they all said that something that made resumes stand out (other than exams and programming) was their experiences outside of class. Well-rounded individuals are pleasant to work with and the ability to juggle multiple things in college lends itself well to time management and organization skills."

I'd also suggest learning SQL (pretty quick to learn) and VBA (I highly recommend this book) by recruiting season. If you're planning to take a third exam this fall, I'd add that at that time too, though it'd be a bit early to list it now if you're currently applying.  Formatting-wise, right-tab the exam dates to match the rest, replace the hyphens in date ranges with en dashes, and add in the missing space before ""Passed"" in the line for P.

actuary,3bjpgn,Exception1228,7,Mon Jun 29 19:53:42 2015 UTC,"First off, I'd suggest removing the company name from your post.  First-round phone interviews are usually pretty short (~30 minutes including their spiel about the company and position) and straightforward. Have answers prepared for open-ended questions like ""Why did you decide to become an actuary?"" and ""Tell me about yourself."" You should also expect a few generic ""Tell me about a time that...""-type questions, especially if you're interviewing with someone in HR. Be prepared to talk about anything that's on your resume, though for a first-round interview you probably won't need to go that in-depth. If you're not from the area, do enough research to say a little bit about why you'd want to live there. I usually only ask 2-4 questions or so after first-round phone interviews since they're so short to begin with, but it's a good idea to write down 8-10 or so beforehand because some of them will get answered before you ask them. Any questions you think of during the interview are also fair game, of course.  Remember that it's a personality test first and foremost - if you're resume is good enough for them to interview you, it's good enough for them to hire you."

You might want to try to get a job as an accountant at an insurance company.  You should also plan to pass more than 2 exams in 2 years, it only gets harder.  2 - Pass rates can be lower than that.  I can't speak for SOA, but on the CAS side, the pass rates are low all the way through.  That means that even seasoned exam takers who are successful actuaries and one exam away from FCAS will regularly fail.  3 - I wouldn't be concerned, but I would prefer that you had insurance experience.  4 - You probably need more statistics based on what you say.

I also got 4 other interview requests.  4.) Calc 3 at least and a stat course. There is some multi variable stuff in P."
actuary,3bdact,LennonVC,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:13:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips, I'll look further into the tax-retirement benefits. I just want the CPA/accounting degree in case I dont get any job offers (preferably like to stay in CA but would be willing to move if necessary).  Is it possible to finish one exam before graduation (my last semester I plan to only take one class)."
actuary,3bdact,LennonVC,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:59:18 2015 UTC,Takes about 300 hours of study for P if you have already have a sold foundation in calculus.

In regards to Calculus 3, I'll have to take it online  If say, I do drop the CPA track (but I still plan to get my accounting degree since there is no actuarial science degree at my school, University of Southern CA), will employers looked concerned that I took corporate finance and Calculus 3 online? My biggest worry is that I'll have a hard time finding an entry-level actuary job when I havent completed the exams or my qualifications are not as impressive as other applicants yet.   How severely I am limiting myself if I want to work in CA (doesnt matter where) for entry-level?   Thanks for the help."

actuary,3bdact,spartanburt,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:11:49 2015 UTC,Awesome. Basically try to ace the exams before looking for jobs then?  Employers wont be concerned if I have an Accounting degree either right? USC only offers a masters in mathematical and no course in actuarial science.
actuary,3bdact,steppe5,2,Sun Jun 28 20:27:03 2015 UTC,"Math would be better than accounting. But having an accounting degree probably would not stop you from getting a job. Do a job search for ""Actuarial student"" you will see most say something along the lines of.    Required Qualifications: Bachelor's or Master's Degree in Actuarial Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Economics or related field.   Must have completed 1 actuarial exam.  Must be an active participant in the Actuarial Student Program, taking additional exams for FSA. Must be able to interpret complex analytical data.

actuary,3b7so4,jebuz23,6,Fri Jun 26 17:39:22 2015 UTC,"If you don't need it to get the offer, it is definitely in your best interest to wait.  Most companies have defined raises for exams and you most likely wouldn't be able to negotiate the salary up as much as these raises (especially for EL).  Additionally, most companies pay for all your study materials and the exam itself as well.  So yes, if you didn't need those exams to get the job, you cost yourself a fair chunk of change.  At my company, approximately $6000 in raises (depending on exam hours), not including exam materials and fees. Oh and we have first time pass bonuses of $1500."
actuary,3b7so4,azim40,5,Fri Jun 26 17:50:54 2015 UTC,"I disagree if OP is a student in college.  Some things to consider:   You can't really be sure what will get you/won't get you an offer.  If you have 2 exams out of college you'll probably get some offers, but would 3 get you more?  Entry-level is getting crowded. I took a job in January that I was going to start in June.  I passed MFE in March and got them to give me the exam raise.  I wouldn't even say I negotiated it, I just asked and they were like ""of course"". Almost nowhere will you not get anything more for having an additional exam. I studied Actuarial Science in undergrad and a lot of people I went to school with held this philosophy, but I think a lot of them were looking for excuses to not try that 3rd exam in undergraduate. In my experience, the same people that argued this took significant time to themselves after graduation, so they weren't really concerned about the money in that case. If you pass more exams in undergrad you'll have less to take after, meaning you'll likely finish faster.  I've never heard an FSA say they wished they passed exams slower. The sooner you get to ASA/FSA the sooner you can get major promotions/job changes.  This will net you more money than the exam raise you're maybe missing. If I saw a resume that passed two exams in college and then had a long break I would be put-off."
actuary,3b7so4,FuckingLoveArborDay,4,Fri Jun 26 18:17:06 2015 UTC,"I'm speaking specifically about already having the offer already signed.  See my comment below.  I understand what you are saying, but you will find that some things in the business world do not work out the way you expect them to.  Many things are based more on money than common sense.  I deal with these types of stupid issues every time I hire someone."
actuary,3b7so4,azim40,-2,Fri Jun 26 18:23:29 2015 UTC,It sounds to me like you probably work for a very large company with a lot of red tape.  Most companies absolutely give exams raises for those exams.

actuary,3b7so4,FloydsMoneyTeam,5,Sat Jun 27 00:33:41 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, the base salary raise is usually the same regardless of when you pass the exam. In your employer's eyes, you passing before you begin work means less money they have to spend giving you study hours, so there's no reason for them to penalize you.  The only thing you might be missing out on is a one time ""first attempt"" bonus for passing on your first try."
actuary,3b7so4,CT_Adam,2,Fri Jun 26 17:51:58 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on passing those extra two exams!  Sorry to hear that your wage increase wasn't what you were hoping for.  As you've already noticed, the these things are handled differently from company to company, and there's clearly not a consensus ""yes"" or ""no"" answer among us.  I'd say the biggest takeaway from your experience should be this:   Questions like this should be brought up with your hiring manager/recruiter/etc.. after you've received a job offer, but before you've accepted it.   This is really the best window of time to ask salary-related questions because you're still in a negotiation stage and because it can get really awkward to discuss your salary later."
actuary,3b7so4,dodgers_fan,4,Fri Jul 3 22:48:45 2015 UTC,"It's possible that your company's exam raises blow.  What are they?  In my experience, pass exams ASAP.

I'm very surprised that they didn't raise your salary by the student program's amount if you passed exams in between when you received your offer and when you started.   As for raises for passing exams in a program vs outside, if all else is equal (experience, position, number of exams, etc), it really shouldn't matter. When a company hires you, they have a range of salaries that they pay students with your experience. They're going to pay you somewhere within that range, and you might have some ability to negotiate to end up higher in that range."
actuary,3b7so4,actuarial123,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:56:05 2015 UTC,"I do not give raises if a new hire passes exams after the offer is accepted and before the student program terms are signed on their first day.  I have a hiring budget and a student program budget, so I cannot do it that way or it will essentially look like I am overpaying a candidate with zero experience.  To be fair, I generally warn new hires of this if they express interest in taking an exam soon."
actuary,3b7so4,azim40,2,Fri Jun 26 18:00:30 2015 UTC,That sucks for them.  Hopefully you're very upfront about that.
actuary,3b7so4,FuckingLoveArborDay,0,Fri Jun 26 18:18:45 2015 UTC,"Well generally, it isn't an issue because who would want to pay for all of the materials and exam fees themselves, when they could just wait until they start work. Plus paid study time and first pass bonuses."
actuary,3b7so4,azim40,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:26:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know, Exam MFE I paid the student fee ($250ish) and got a $4k raise.  Already had a textbook for that, so I guess that helped maximize ROI.  Yeah, I guess I wasn't getting paid study time, but I was a student so all I did was study.  Again, this must just be your company, but I think I would expect a company to honor a first-time pass bonus between accepting and starting.  I get that this is how it works at your company - and that's okay - but I feel the need to respond to your comments to let anyone else reading know that isn't where it is everywhere."
actuary,3b7so4,FuckingLoveArborDay,0,Fri Jun 26 18:34:36 2015 UTC,"Well, it has been the case, for EL at least, at 2 of 3 companies that I have worked for and several other that I know of through industry peers.  They have a defined salary for EL candidates no matter what the actual exam total is before they start working.  Once you are employed, they are paying for an experience/exam combination and can justify it.  So yes, it is not that way everywhere, but it is in enough places to maybe just consider waiting."
actuary,3b7so4,azim40,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:38:46 2015 UTC,I suppose it depends on how you handle your merit compensation. You'd hope that a student in OP's situation would at least see a corresponding bump in their annual salary raise. Otherwise that creates some really perverse incentives.
actuary,3b7so4,actuarial123,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:24:06 2015 UTC,"You'd hope, but at my company you would be wrong.  Hopefully someday we will get a chief actuary that isn't just looking at the short term bottom line."
actuary,3b7so4,azim40,2,Fri Jun 26 18:28:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's frustrating I'm sure.

If you know a programming language you'll have an upper hand over other candidates.    Do not exclusively rely on HR; use the actuarial directory and send cold emails.

Employers will often have a required pace to obtain your credentials as well as a set exam pace.

She won't even know we're taking it unless we're going through her, which we only do for our first attempt. Are you asking this based on anecdotal experiences, or just what you've heard? If it's the former, your interviews were abnormal. If it's the latter, I would disregard what you've heard."

actuary,3b54tv,AKtuary179,2,Fri Jun 26 01:49:25 2015 UTC,"If you've already paid take the exam. I had 10 weeks to study for MFE and thought for sure a week before the exam I would fail. I got a week long ADAPT, took 10 practice exams, and passed with an 8.   That's my anecdote, but the important thing is that you're better off taking it and if you do end up failing you'll be better prepared the next time around. You really have nothing to lose; as someone else said employers don't care about attempts."

Many actuaries fail the exams. Hell, Milton Friedman (who was a pretty smart dude) failed some. Take a look at the questions posted in /r/actuary. You'll see a lot of people find it difficult to overcome low GPAs."
actuary,3aywai,CallMeAML,4,Thu Jun 25 01:10:00 2015 UTC,"Hi, I was an economics major in college. I think you're right to focus primarily on school. Actuarial exams are definitely important to getting a first job, but a bad GPA post graduation is harder to overcome than not having passed actuarial exams.  As for tips, I'd really recommend trying to study and pass exams during the summer. It can be hard with the internship, but I found it easier than studying while juggling a full course load. Maybe try studying for the September sitting of P?"
actuary,3aywai,actuarial123,2,Wed Jun 24 19:15:31 2015 UTC,I'm just glad you're not a intellectually pansy and bothered to take stuff that is actually challenging.   But id probably study during the summer when you have more free time.
actuary,3aywai,getonmyhype,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:24:33 2015 UTC,There should be courses in math and econ that correspond well to the exams. After taking probability class I was able to pass exam p easily with less than one week of preparations.
actuary,3aywai,jyz002,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:33:05 2015 UTC,"Just a matter of managing your time. Don't schedule exams around finals if you can help it. When you're tired and wouldn't retain material well by studying, use that time to work ahead in your classes instead. In that sense, I found it helpful to not try and stick to a particular schedule for studying."
actuary,3aywai,tf113,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:40:04 2015 UTC,"the summer is definitely your friend. And dont worry about passing a bunch in school. Wait until after you graduate and get a job where they'll pay for study material, study hours, and reward you with pay bumps and bonuses when you pass. If you can try and lock down a permanent job from your internship, that's definitely most important right now.   edit: that is, if you like your internship and the company it is with."
actuary,3b000h,elephantpurple,2,Wed Jun 24 21:36:18 2015 UTC,"There are online courses that you can take to get your VEE credits. Some are specifically designed for the VEE's, others are just regular courses offered through distance studies by certain schools. Also, you don't need to complete your VEE credits in order to start taking exams. You can write exams now, if you wanted."
actuary,3b000h,jplank1983,2,Wed Jun 24 22:09:46 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about the VEEs. They're fairly easy to get, and most employers don't care if you have them when you graduate. I'd strongly recommend taking an exam in either August (FM) or September (P) though - actuarial internships are incredibly important, most companies recruit for them in September-November or so, and you'd have trouble getting one without an exam passed."
actuary,3b000h,tf113,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:23:03 2015 UTC,"VEEs shouldn't be your main focus, but the classes that count for VEE credit are usually good to take anyway, so if you get a chance to take those classes, I would go ahead and do it. That said, employers care WAY more about number of exams passed rather than VEEs, so try to get P and FM out of the way before recruiting season.  Once you graduate and have your entry level position, you can take online courses (check out NEAS or ACTEX for that stats credit) in between exam sittings or before you start with the modules."
actuary,3ayq87,CD_Johanna,4,Wed Jun 24 16:00:39 2015 UTC,"The reason you don't pay off 3 * 270.57 is because you only need to pay the remaining balance of the loan, and Cathy has already paid some of that back by making her annual payments.  Start at Year 0: She has borrowed 1000 so she owes 1000 to ABS  Right before her payment in year 1: She owes 1000 * 1.11 = 1110 (this is the cost of borrowing money)  Right after her payment in year 1: She owes 1110 - 270.57 = 839.43  Right before her payment in year 2: She owes 839.43 * 1.11 = 931.77 (Again this is the cost of borrowing money)  Right after her payment in year 2: She owes 931.77 - 270.57 = 661.20  So ABS isn't giving her a break, but instead charging Cathy how much she actually ""owes"" to ABS.  In general, the prepayment penalty is assessed for 2 reasons that I can think of:   It costs the bank a certain expense to close Cathy's loan and account More importantly, Cathy will tend to prepay when rates drop below the rate at which she originally borrowed. For example, if Cathy can get a loan after year 2 for 8%, she'll borrow the amount of money needed to pay off the original loan and prepay. The problem for ABS, is that they now need to loan out this unexpected money at a lower rate than they initially anticipated. So ABS attaches a prepayment penalty to try and disincentivize Cathy's anti-selection   Hope this makes sense"
actuary,3ayq87,actuarial123,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:49:20 2015 UTC,"It is assumed that they have other customers. Those payments can immediately be loaned out to others at the same (or possibly better) rates. I think you're expecting her early payments to ""sit there"" until the end of her scheduled payment plan but they would be invested instead, so in theory, the bank isn't losing out. The exams are often theory based, so in practice they would expect to incur some cost in making another investment, which is why there is a small penalty."

actuary,3awxpm,colonelsmoothie,2,Wed Jun 24 13:02:03 2015 UTC,"It's very common for FCASs who work in reinsurance to switch into underwriting. It's client-facing, and you get to learn how to sell and how deals are done, which can help your career if you want to move up. Plus, you can make more in commissions than you would by being an actuary, if you're good."
actuary,3awxpm,MattDamonFace,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:51:22 2015 UTC,Can verify. This describes me. UW with actiarial credentials are found at executive levels in many reinsurance companies.

actuary,3awxpm,getonmyhype,3,Wed Jun 24 13:31:58 2015 UTC,The numbers you list don't suggest that UW has higher salary potential as what was listed above

I primarily focused my studies on the SOA 305. Of the 35 questions I got today about 20 were pretty much identical to problems I had already seen before, another 10 were a variation of a problem I had seen. I had to completely guess on 4 of the problems, but for the most part the SOA 305 covered my ass. There are only about 280 valid questions remaining in the SOA 305, I could probably answer all but 10 of the questions off the top of my head. Idk why I even bother buying study guides. I honestly believe that actuarial outpost is a bunch of people hired by EzraPenland, Coaching Actuaries, Infinite Actuaries, and DWS to stir up noise and excitement. SOA study questions were all I used to pass exam P as well. I used Actex for FM and MFE, but I honestly think I could have passed just using old SOA exams and their sample question pack.

actuary,3awjl1,mathieforlife,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:51:18 2015 UTC,"SOA sample problems are just old SOA exams, this is why I believe the difficulty of the actual exam is nearly identical to the sample questions. There are some super easy questions and some super hard questions. The idea is that you need to get ALL of the easy ones right and about half of the hard ones in order to pass. The last 20 questions in the SOA 305 sample question set are new questions made specifically for mortality table and simulations. Study the SOA 305. Live by them and die by them."

actuary,3ascvf,tommyjohnagin,3,Tue Jun 23 07:49:06 2015 UTC,"The study materials for MLC are really solid: the material didn't change too much with the style of the exam, plus it's been more than a year since they implemented the written section so things are pretty stable.  Both MLC and C are exams with tons of material, you're only going to have August and September and most of October to study... I'd go with MLC since you have at least some experience with the material."
actuary,3ascvf,10nc,3,Tue Jun 23 03:12:20 2015 UTC,"I'd go MLC first for 2 reasons you don't mention.   You took a class on it. The longer you wait, the less you'll remember.  ( P/FM order ) < MFE < MLC < C.  I think it's wise to take them in difficulty order. It's not a huge huge deal, but I do think it helps."
actuary,3ascvf,DecoysLoisDecoys,2,Tue Jun 23 12:44:53 2015 UTC,"To add to what others have said, keep in mind that taking MLC first would give you more flexibility down the road as far as exam timing is concerned, since C is offered more often and at different times than the rest of the exams you have left."
actuary,3ascvf,tf113,2,Tue Jun 23 16:09:26 2015 UTC,"Something to keep in mind is that you won't find out if you passed MLC right away. So if you take MLC first and start studying for C in February, you could find out halfway through that you actually need to retake MLC. I'm in that boat right now studying for C but still waiting on the April MLC results.   If you take C first then you'll know immediately which exam you'll be taking next. Although that does cut off a few weeks of study time for October and just set you up to be waiting on MLC exam results down the line.   I would probably go with MLC because of the extra study time but try and be honest with yourself after taking it about your odds of passing. Then hopefully you can avoid studying the wrong material while you wait for results."
actuary,3ascvf,AKtuary179,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:03:51 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm in a similar position as you. I passed MFE in march and couldn't take C in June because I would be (am now) on vacation.  I had to decided whether to do C, S, or 5 in October (I'm CAS). I ended up starting to study for 5. Here's why:  C is the last test I can take ""off schedule"" either Feb. Or June. Exam S (stats) is being offered for the first time in October, so I'd prefer to avoid the initial run. I start work in July and exam 5 has two textbooks available for free, which was also nice.  I don't officially start until July so I won't be able to get any funding for exam materials until then.   So, hopefully pass 5 in Oct, hopefully pass S in April. If I'm up for it, attempt C in Feb or June, if I feel that's cramming too much testing in, i can always wait until Oct of next year and I won't be any more 'behind schedule' than if I took C this October.   What also might be worth considering is if a coworker of yours is planning on studying for anything coming up.  I like when I know someone else is studying the same material as me so we can have a couples ""water cooler"" conversations about it from time to time."

If so they might have career days or networking events you could ask to attend. If not, see if your school has a career center that can offer some guidance. They usually like to help grads. You should focus on networking.   Search for actuary groups in your state/area on the SOA and CAS sites, then email them explaining your interest and ask to join. Check out https://actuarialdirectory.org/Default.aspx?TabID=1754 and search your state (or states you want to work in) and start emailing actuaries. I would recommend keeping track on a spreadsheet or something, because you will probably contact a lot of them. I've been emailing 1 person at each firm, and usually aim for someone with a title like ""senior actuary"" who probably is involved in the hiring process.   Keep your email short and say something like ""hi, found your email on the directory, graduated and passed two exams, looking for advice on getting started, can I meet with you?"" You might want to professionalize that up a wee bit. I've had about a 40% response rate for this. Provide your email and phone number.   Make a list of questions you want to ask and be friendly, polite, and genuinely curious when communicating. You should ask general advice, some of your own questions, and if they know of any people, groups, or companies you should also contact. Also ask if they know of any opportunities you should look into.  I've seen other people get jobs this way and it's what virtually every actuary I've spoken with recommends. I've only been doing it about a week but I've been asked for my resume a couple times for consideration in positions that they haven't announce yet, I've been added to an email group that sends out openings as soon as they become available in the area, and I've made some good connections at a local CAS group meeting.  You can try reaching out to a headhunter too. I've heard they aren't the best for EL but it could help, so you might as well try. They may give resume and interview tips, even if they aren't what ultimately connects you with a job.   There is always pressure to get a job and that's tough. If you wanted a job in fast food or retail, you could expect to land one in a week or two. As an actuary it's going to take a bit longer. Be patient, keep your head up, and keep working on improving your candidacy in the mean time!"

actuary,3aqr1f,Xerpy,2,Mon Jun 22 19:15:29 2015 UTC,TIA for P is excellent. I can recommend it highly. I used TIA + ADAPT.

I really don't feel good about it, but I've been staying after work each day until 9 or 10 and going at it on the weekends.  When you simulate a non-path dependent stock, you can just put your Z values in L1 and type the formula once in L2. I use that a lot, it's especially helpful when the problem asks for average stock price and you can just use 1-var stats on L2.   When solving for variance and you have to do the quadratic I typically store a to x, b to y, c to z, then when I do sqrt(b2-4ac) I store that as t.    That's pretty simple though.   Another one I like is for binomial trees, storing your probability of an up move as x, and discount factor (if applicable) as y. Sometimes before I'm in the payoff tree I'll use u and d as stored variables.   Sorry nothing really too helpful or incredibly time saving."

If they are not independent, just write it out like this...  Var = E(Var) + Var(E)  Don't think about solving it yet, just write out what the variance of the distribution is in terms of the parameters using the tables. Then plug those into the formula for Var and E. Then you have simple lookups from the tables provided.    For example, pretend the distribution is exponential with theta uniform on [0, 10]. Here are the easy steps:  Var = E(Var) + Var(E)  Var = E( theta2 ) + Var(theta)  <-- Var and E found from Exponential dist. table  Var = ( Var(theta) + E(theta)2  ) + Var(theta)    <-- this is the formula to evaluate  Var(theta) = 1012 /12  E(theta) = (10-0)/2  Then plug into the bolded formula above."

actuary,3aq0sw,CD_Johanna,3,Mon Jun 22 15:59:18 2015 UTC,"Hello! To solve for Kevin's overall yield rate, you just have to sort through all of the money Kevin spends and receives. The money he spends is sometimes referred to as ""cash flow out"", since it is the money that is leaving him. Similarly, the money he receives is called ""cash flow in"" since it is coming towards him. It might be helpful to think of it visually as money literally leaving and entering his wallet/bank/whatever.  With your your calculator, you have to make sure to use negative values for money that someone is spending and positive values for money that someone is receiving. When I was doing these annuity problems, I never thought about the terms ""cash flow in"" or ""cash flow out"". Just think of it more simply: money that someone spends is NEGATIVE and money that someone receives is POSITIVE. This is pretty intuitive since we all like to get money and we don't like to lose money!  From his perspective, Kevin loses 5000 at time 0 because he's lending Peter this money; this value therefore must be negative. Kevin receives payments of 400 from Peter at times 1, 2, and 3, all of which are positive because he is gaining this money. Finally at time 3, he receives 5278.91 from Martha because he sold her the right to the remaining payments (this value is calculated at the beginning of the solution), which is means this value also must be positive.   In summary, from Kevin's perspective: -5000 at time 0, +400 at time 1, +400 at time 2, +400 at time 3, and +5278.91 at time 3. This is summarized in the equation of value ""5000 = 400a3 + 5,278.91v3"".   Bringing it all together, when inputting these values into your calculator, you'll have PV = -5000, PMT = 400, FV = 5278.91 and N = 3 (since there are 3 payments of 400 and the FV is calculated at time 3).  Time diagrams are extremely useful for these types problems, and I would strongly suggest drawing one out for each and every annuity or cash flow question.   This is my first Reddit post so I hope things aren't too confusing. Please let me know if you have any more questions."

It's not immediately clear to me what would be the cash flow in vs. the cash flow out   it's a mater of perspective. just pick one and take it from there. i sell you a car: which cash flows are positive and which are negative? from your perspective the price you pay is a negative cash flow, from my perspective it is positive. regardless, the price equals the present value of future cash flows.  ""but at what interest rate?"" that's what the yield is: it makes the present value of future cash flows equal to the price. they have to either give you the price or the yield."

actuary,3am9gr,kazpandabear,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:24:31 2015 UTC,"Here is what I understand about it. Correct me since I'm not in the field (maybe soon though) and probably horribly wrong.  ACA doesn't allow insurers to set prices based on existing conditions. This alone would cause prices to skyrocket since all the ill people will want insurance. To balance this ACA requires everybody to get insurance by fining them for not having insurance (individual mandate).   To discourage insurers from trying to select the healthiest people there is a risk sharing provision. If you get a lot of sick people you get money. If you get a lot of healthy people you give money.  Insurers only have information on their own customers, and everything is so new and different that they have no idea what kind of draw they got (of healthy/ill people) compared to other insurers."

actuary,3am9gr,zech83,2,Mon Jun 22 03:08:58 2015 UTC,"They don't know what others got, but we know what percentage we got and that helps a lot because in Illinois the blues have most of the business and is likely reflective of the whole pool.the risk share you discussed is still unknown. Last I talked with our leadership we haven't received any payments from private or public exchanges to account for risk inequities."
actuary,3am9gr,kazpandabear,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:23:51 2015 UTC,"Are there risks of competitors under-pricing to gain market share? It seems like the risk adjustment and the risk corridor would encourage the competition to slightly undercut, specially in a state like IL where the majority of people are covered by one company.  Are you a UIUC alum by chance?"
actuary,3am9gr,zech83,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:25:57 2015 UTC,"There was a chance of that, but most companies were risk adverse and didn't offer if they weren't competitive in a state. Exchange offerings line up pretty well with discount strength state by state. I did go to UIUC, but wasn't in the actuarial science program. I was an economics major with a finance minor and graduated in 08. Due to the poor job market I passed two exams after graduating and then started working in health care consulting and am now on the carrier side.are you a UIUC alum as well?"
actuary,3am9gr,kazpandabear,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:22:47 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I guess economy of scales would make it difficult for any small outfit to undercut without grossly miss-pricing.
actuary,3am9gr,zech83,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:48:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. The exchanges are kind of like a shell game right now, the young healthy people in bronze and silver plans is what's wanted until the risk adjustments are made. At least this will give some transparency on the whole. In my opinion it would be better for the government to self insure by state to cut the risk and profit margin that's inherit in a fully insured product."
actuary,3am9gr,tf113,2,Sun Jun 21 22:57:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced that those benefits would outweigh the benefits that come from competition under the current system. Either way, I'd really like to see an econometric study comparing them."
actuary,3am9gr,zech83,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:42:06 2015 UTC,"A self insured product would still go up for bid every few years, could have trend guarantees, and they could have consulting firms do network evaluations to ensure the government picks the most competitive network. Hell, even if you did an exchange with multiple carriers and self insured it you could get rid of the margins, both risk and profit, and offer products for less."
actuary,3am9gr,tf113,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:53:23 2015 UTC,"You may have lost me. Are you suggesting that the government collect premiums and bear the risk, and just contract out administrative work to carriers? Or something more like government-written reinsurance for carriers?"
actuary,3am9gr,zech83,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:09:54 2015 UTC,"Bear the risk and contact out the networks and administrative work. That's what large employees like Boeing does. Due to the law of large numbers they (Boeing) are safe from high cost claimants because their risk pool is predictable because it's so large. The public exchanges would be predictable and they are already paying the risk, just now with profit margin."
actuary,3aijm4,meganopolis,4,Sat Jun 20 15:01:38 2015 UTC,"A financial calculator is almost essential for FM. You plug in the PV, FV, num/value of payments and it computes interest rate."

actuary,3aijm4,bluewolfcub,2,Sat Jun 20 15:45:21 2015 UTC,"You can pick a random interest rate like 5%, see that the value is way too high/low, and pick one much lower/higher, then interpolate the two"

actuary,3aijm4,smthsmth,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:53:33 2015 UTC,.025 isn't one of the answer choices. Finding .025 leads you to the correct answer.
actuary,3ahcpv,lotowarrior,6,Sat Jun 20 04:44:58 2015 UTC,Your best bet would be to network and meet other actuaries & actuarial students.

When I was in consulting, if you were willing to put in the work you'd move up the ladder in pretty short order.  It was really only limited by the rate at which you could master whatever projects you were working on.

actuary,3afiux,ShakeNBakes,2,Fri Jun 19 21:07:44 2015 UTC,"Being at small companies gives a person a chance to be involved in a lot more things. You'll be working with finance, claims, hr, uw, IT and will have a lot more exposure. That being said, generally it's harder to move up in smaller companies. They don't need 2 big bosses, so generally, you find that unless your boss leaves, there won't be a position to move up into. Where in big companies, they have large departments, where people usually leave, giving other people chances to move up."

I would take those first. You should be able to past both within 4 months, just take FM in Aug and MFE in Nov. P was hard for me because I never took a probability class and my calculus was very rusty.

Any breaks/brushing your teeth/eating food, you're also hitting the flashcards.  Make two piles: a yes and a no and sort the cards by whether you know them.  Only redo the nos, don't waste your time on the yes's.  Hopefully the no pile is dwindling.  Sunday: depends on Saturday.  Did you magically kill it?  Did you get above 2/3 of the problems right on that last real style exam?  If so, you get to only take 2 tests on Sunday and spend the remainder memorizing the shit out of those formulas.  If you didn't (and realistically, I wouldn't expect you to), you need to do another 3 tests.  All Sunday tests are real style.  Sunday night, no matter what, get a full nights sleep.  So fucking key.  Monday you're not taking any practice tests.  You need to save your brain for the real thing.

I am contacting you as I’m interested in any actuarial or catastrophe modelling roles you may have available at (insurance company). As a company at the heart of Lloyd’s, (insurance company) offers the opportunity to work on a large variety of business classes, which I am extremely keen to learn more about. As one of the largest Lloyd’s syndicates, the wealth of knowledge and expertise (insurance company) has to offer is something that has attracted me to the company.  The modelling and prediction of future events based on past events is something that has always interested me, and a career where I would be able to apply the quantitative and analytical skills I have acquired throughout my degrees in a business environment is what I am looking for. My placement at (previous Lloyd's insurer) provided me with an introduction to the actuarial profession and the way a London market insurer operates, and has only strengthened my desire to remain within the industry.

Decided to give it another shot after I had more experience and it worked out this time around. I should get credit for Exam S, I think. Someone correct me if i'm wrong.  Realized I didn't answer the question. The material on that exam appeared easier than Ito Lemma's and I figured I'd pass MFE soon after. Didn't give it much thought. In retrospect, passing MFE first would have made more sense."
actuary,3a6x3c,tf113,2,Wed Jun 17 18:59:18 2015 UTC,"And to respond to your edit, taking MLC third made a lot more sense pre-WA than it does today, and it was obviously a great idea if you were looking into it shortly before WA was implemented.  For what it's worth, they're removing a lot of the tougher SDE stuff from MFE in the near future."

You'll get credit for exam LC, but to get full credit for S you'll need to pass ST either this coming October or next April.

I spent over a year half-heartedly looking for a job in that field, but realized I didn't enjoy typical engineering that much, so wanted to go into research. I then realized it would be difficult to get to where I wanted to be without a PhD, and I wasn't really feeling like spending 5+ years of my life to get one, coming out with six figures of debt (I was lucky enough to finish undergrad with zero debt). I've always been more mathematically inclined, so my parents, who are both in insurance, suggested I look into becoming an actuary. I passed FM in August, P in November, got a job offer later in November, and have been working since January. My unique background actually helped me stick out like a sore thumb when I came in for the interview, and gave me plenty to discuss during."

C, while working full time, was a different beast all together. I got 130 study hours from work and failed my first attempt. My program paid for the TIA online seminar, and I think transitioning from self-study/only reading the manual to video lessons taught by an instructor caused me to not pay attention as much (I was guilty of spacing out/playing games on my phone in college classes). I'm going to go through the ASM manual for the sections I did poorly on and actually learn the material this time around, rather than just memorizing how to of the problems."

Not to disagree with your points, just offering an example.  Do some math tutoring for money while you're taking those exams and you'll have 'work' to put on your resume.

actuary,3aat08,tf113,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:22:47 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer to focus on school rather than splitting my attention between school and studying for actuarial exams   Remember that it's a lot easier to pass exams while in school (if you're not working heavily at the same time) than to pass them while you're working, which you'll need to do as an actuary. The last thing a potential employer will want to hear (or see on your resume) is that you can't balance studying for the exams with other obligations.  If I were in your position, I'd take FM in August, P in September, and MFE in November, and start applying for jobs as soon as you pass P. Most companies hire most of their actuaries in September-November or so. If you're dead set on taking time off after you graduate, at least spend it doing something cool - traveling is the obvious suggestion - instead of just sitting at your parents' studying."

actuary,3aat08,s4gres,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:08:30 2015 UTC,"That makes more sense. If you aren't already, I'd suggest looking into data science as well - your Master's degree would probably be more valuable there, you wouldn't have to take exams, and the work itself would involve more math.

actuary,3aat08,tf113,-3,Thu Jun 18 16:30:27 2015 UTC,they will most likely not hire you because you show no work ethic.   Because passing actuarial exams does not show any work ethic...   ITT: cocky people that can pass actuarial exams with 2 hours of studying.

actuary,3aat08,s4gres,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:20:01 2015 UTC,Have you been passing exams studying less than 200 hours? I feel like that's lower than the average student. 15*52/4=195.
actuary,3aat08,zech83,3,Thu Jun 18 18:32:43 2015 UTC,it took me about 50-100 hours to pass each preliminary exam and about 150-200 hours to pass the FSA exams. I would say that was average for the school i went to.
actuary,3aat08,s4gres,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:05:27 2015 UTC,That seems way lighter than what people post on the actuarial outpost especially for MFE/MLC/C.
actuary,3aat08,zech83,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:19:36 2015 UTC,"IMO, actuarial outpost is not composed of the average actuary. There is a small portion of users that are very intelligent. Most of them work for actuarial study websites / promote their study materials. The rest are, for the lack of a better term, not smart.   Websites give out the ""200 hour"" rule for a couple reasons. 1) to emphasize that exams are hard and 2) make people buy study materials. But at the end of the day, it all depends on the person. For some studying 200 hours for preliminary exams is fine, but those people will most likely never make it out of the FSA exams."
actuary,3aat08,s4gres,2,Thu Jun 18 20:25:06 2015 UTC,Agree to disagree. The people putting in 200 hours are passing exams on that site and clearly have put passing exams as a priority and I feel that's about right for the last 3 prelims. If you're taking classes on the exams too then I think that may our disconnect as that would obviously decrease the amount of time needed to study.

actuary,3aat08,s4gres,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:48:31 2015 UTC,At my undergrad top students would finish 4 exams or more with two internships (or something over achieving like triple major/research) . FM and P are passable by college freshmen assuming high school calculus and a desire to be an actuary from the get go.   I'd say on average pure math students are mathematically stronger than applied students.
actuary,3aat08,PassionVoid,-1,Tue Jun 23 01:45:02 2015 UTC,"Thats funny, i've been in the industry for 10 years and feel like my comment is still the average, especially for the prelim exams. Yes, the FSA exams are harder and its closer to 200 hours."
actuary,3aat08,tf113,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:45:52 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I don't know then. All of the FSAs I've talked to believe the 100 hours per exam hour rule is pretty accurate. I talked to one FSA who studied for over 500 hours for one of the FSA exams."
actuary,3aat08,s4gres,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:12:59 2015 UTC,"That's nice to know. I've been in that ballpark for the prelims, but I've been somewhat worried I'd still need to put in 350+ for each FSA exam."
actuary,3aat08,tf113,2,Thu Jun 18 22:09:26 2015 UTC,the FSA exams take about 2.5 times the studying.
actuary,3aat08,s4gres,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:46:38 2015 UTC,"I based that off a guess as to how much time the typical person spends studying, not the amount of time I personally spent. I feel like 150 hours each for P and FM, 200-250 for MFE, and 250-300 for C is pretty typical - but again, that's just a semi-educated guess and not based on my own study time."
actuary,3aat08,u38cg,0,Thu Jun 18 18:48:31 2015 UTC,no. passing exams shows you are smart. doing good work and getting shit done shows you have good work ethic.
actuary,3aat08,u38cg,2,Thu Jun 18 20:08:58 2015 UTC,"Short answer: no.  Long answer.  Firstly, where you are in the world bears on how many exams are normal.  In North America, you're expected to have done quite a few.  In the UK, to have done any is the exception.  Once you get to a certain number of exams, you need to have the commensurate experience.  Having all of them and experience - well that puts you in the weird guy pile.  Why would I want someone who didn't want a job at all?  How long will it be till he heads back to his parents?"

actuary,3aat08,u38cg,0,Fri Jun 19 18:15:42 2015 UTC,"Actuarial work covers a vast number of areas and roles, so it's difficult to generalise.  That said, there's a reason it often comes up as one of the top quality of life professions.    One comment - a masters isn't needed.  If you're doing it for career reasons, make sure it's worthwhile.  If you've got a pure maths degree, you should be able to toss off a few exams by the end of the year and start looking for internships or the like.    I'm in the UK, though, so more local advice would be good."
actuary,3aat08,SuperSmashedBro,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:56:33 2015 UTC,I'm from the US. I want to do my master's partly to have more time to get some research experience in case at the end of it I become certain that I want to pursue a Ph.D in math. I've enjoyed pretty much every single course I've taken up to this point(even all the non-quantitative ones) so I feel like taking more courses even if it's purely for its own sake.   I really enjoy being a student and feel like my education is ending too soon so I'm not sure if I want to start working just yet and I'd much rather study for a dozen exams that take 200-400+ hours of study each rather than working immediately.
actuary,3aat08,zech83,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:58:33 2015 UTC,If you're a shoe in PhD candidate the exams shouldn't take you that much time to study for. The first three can be completed in under 150 hours each.

actuary,3aat08,colonelsmoothie,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:36:53 2015 UTC,I'm not worried about the difficulty of either and from what I understand the difficulty of the actuarial exams stems from the volume of information moreso than the depth. The only issue is that I wanted to focus on my master's and on getting research experience so I wanted to know if I had the option of taking a year off after my master's(assuming that by the end of my master's I decide not to go the academia route and decide to become an actuary) to study for the actuarial exams(instead of studying for the exams while doing my master's).

actuary,3a6w7n,SwedishLovePump,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:24:32 2015 UTC,"I am employed, but new to the industry, so take this knowing that I am not an expert.  When calculating reserves, a lot of assumptions go into the calculation.  For example, estimating lapse rates, mortality rates, termination rates etc.  An experience study allows a company to look at their past experience for a given product.  That can be used to 'fine tune' or adjust the assumptions that go into reserving or possible even pricing (I don't do pricing so I have no idea how it works.)  For an example, imagine you assume 6% lapse rates on a particular product.  That is built into your reserving information etc.  Maybe you have been selling that product for a long time.  So you could look at the historical trend for your company in particular.  You do so and realize that your specific company has only seen lapse rates closer to 2%.  You would obviously want to adjust your assumptions to match what you are actually 'experiencing'."

I agree 100% about the prelims, but I actually enjoy studying for my FSA exams (at least I think I do between study periods like right now) because the material is useful/good knowledge/aids in understanding."

actuary,3a6frg,casact921,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:26:17 2015 UTC,"P&C person here.  It all comes down to the answer to this question.  How large of a pay cut are you willing to take? The larger the pay cut, the more chances you have.   Even if you've done P&C your entire career, it's not easy to switch to between different lines of business. If you have 15 years of auto experience, you're going to struggle to get a position doing workers comp even with a FCAS."
actuary,3a6frg,doc89,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:56:07 2015 UTC,"I mean, I unfortunately cannot take a pay cut right now. But I would take equal to my post-FSA pay even if my current company outbid them.  I am very bored with my job and do not have a good feeling about future opportunities at my current company unless I relocate. I would need a very large pay increase to consider relocation."
actuary,3a6frg,casact921,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:31:47 2015 UTC,"FSA can't sign SAOs so it essentially has no value to a P&C company, especially if you have no experience in P&C. You won't start at the bottom but don't expect to get fellow level salary.

actuary,3a6a6g,CD_Johanna,3,Wed Jun 17 15:46:33 2015 UTC,"Man we have some hardcore people here.  I try to do every problem, but I also have a time limit.  I'm not spending more than 10 minutes on something if I'm not getting traction.  If I have genuinely no clue how to do something, I'll look in the notes to try to figure it out, then look at the solution and see if a step or two can prod me into understanding.  Then, at the end of my study time, when I am inevitably freaking out and feeling far behind, I try to stick to doing at least half of the problems (and not the first half, at least every other problem so you see the full variety of questions).  Really though, towards the beginning when you're building the foundational concepts, you should do as many problems as you can."
actuary,3a6a6g,10nc,3,Wed Jun 17 23:38:45 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm going to go against the grain from everyone else. My study plan consists of going through TIA as fast as possible without doing a single practice problem at the end of each section (there are some ""exercises"" at the end of videos which I will pause and do though). Then I start on the easiest setting on ADAPT and bust through as many probs as I can. Passed P and FM first try doing this and I'm feeling good about passing C in two weeks.  So to answer your questions: zero."
actuary,3a6a6g,DesertDrummer,3,Wed Jun 17 23:49:41 2015 UTC,"If you are going to skip problems, do like odds or evens or every third. Honestly though I would make the time to do them all, it's the best way to learn.  From what I remember, I could do a section and like 20-30 problems in like 2 or 3 hours."
actuary,3a6a6g,AsSubtleAsABrick,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:18:28 2015 UTC,I used ASM for most of my preliminaries and I did every question except the last one from each section. The last question usually seemed excessively hard and I felt ok skipping it.
actuary,3a6a6g,jplank1983,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:44:31 2015 UTC,3 months for FM is way more than enough time to do all the problems in ASM
actuary,3a6a6g,ActuarialGrape,-5,Wed Jun 17 15:49:29 2015 UTC,"You also told me in another thread that 2 months is more than enough time to prepare for any preliminary exam.   But when you make statements like these, how many hours per day are you studying?   And compared to other actuarial students, would you say your math abilities are average, above average, or prodigious?"
actuary,3a6a6g,jplank1983,3,Wed Jun 17 16:05:45 2015 UTC,"Even though I'm not the person you replied to, I'll give my thoughts:   I'd say 2 months might be a bit tight for C or MLC or maybe even MFE. 3 months is sufficient though. When I studied, I made a table of the chapter in the manual and how many questions were in that chapter. I took the total and divided it up so that I was doing roughly the same number of questions per day. (i.e. if there were 900 questions and 30 days, I'd be doing about 30 questions per day). Then I marked off how far I needed to be every week. i.e. Whichever chapter came after 210 questions, 420 questions, etc. These were my checkpoints. It was ok if I struggled with a section and got a bit behind as long as I did questions from the other sections faster and made up the time in order to be where I needed to be each weekend. This worked well for me. Some days I spent a lot of time studying, other days less. I don't remember exactly how many hours I studied each day, but it was a lot and I didn't go out with friends as much. On the other hand, I think it's a good tradeoff to study more now than to have to re-take the exam and give up more time later re-studying. My math abilities are above average (I think) when it comes to the type of math that hasn't shown up on any of the exams and average when it comes to the math that's actually relevant to the exams. The vast majority of the exam material was new to me."
actuary,3a6a6g,jebuz23,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:51:47 2015 UTC,"I used Finan for FM so I'm not too familiar with ASM for FM, but I did every practice problem in Finan. I used ASM for MFE and did every problem, but I also had more than three months, so I can understand the time crunch.    I don't think there's a magic number like ""Only do 5"". Do as many problems as you think you need to in order to feel comfortable with the concept.  If you've done a couple and gotten them right with no hesitation, then maybe skip to the next concept.  If you're still struggling and aren't sure, do a couple more.   In my opinion the practice exams are more important than the practice problems in each chapter. Make sure you leave yourself enough time to take enough of those (the real way) and also make sure to go over the ones you got wrong so that you don't get them wrong again. If being able to have a couple weeks to do that means you skip some practice problems now, I think that's worth it. Although, like you said, in a perfect world you'd do them all."

No. You will just have to continuously study and make sure to understand everything.  If you do have previous knowledge of the material, you should be fine. I passed FM yesterday and studied for a month, ~3 hours a day, but I also did have previous knowledge of the material.  Good luck!"
actuary,3a4fzb,Skidvish,17,Wed Jun 17 03:48:50 2015 UTC,"None.  I've done a few things where a basic understanding of sequences and series was actually helpful but we have computers for that.  However, I'm a big believer that there is more to being a successful actuary than only knowing what it takes to do the job. Being able to think and understand how/why certain mathematical topics work is more fundamental than being able to just solve a bunch of problems."
actuary,3a4fzb,jenkinsear,4,Wed Jun 17 03:59:48 2015 UTC,"So is it like, ""if we can get a students mathematical competency to x level, that person will have the mental capabilities to solve the problems for the job."""
actuary,3a4fzb,jenkinsear,2,Wed Jun 17 04:36:57 2015 UTC,There is a major push by all actuarial orgs to force you to think like an actuary. A part of that is mathematics. Have I ever used my understanding of the mlc pricing formula for a life insurance product? Nope. But it lays out the fundamental issues we deal with and how to think about a rate.

actuary,3a4fzb,jplank1983,3,Wed Jun 17 05:56:06 2015 UTC,Sql and excel
actuary,3a4fzb,u38cg,3,Wed Jun 17 12:54:01 2015 UTC,Mostly just Excel. The actual math is important only to the extent that it gives you a good foundation for the concepts that you'll actually be using in your work. i.e. understanding a formula that relates X and Y will help you understand the effect on one variable if the other changes.
actuary,3a4fzb,peterxyz,4,Wed Jun 17 14:28:40 2015 UTC,"To be clear, there is literally no job on this earth where you will actually do Calc 101 maths on a daily basis.

If you pass FM and MLC you get credit for the EA-1. Definitely get MLC if you have passed P and FM.  Unlike SOA exams working in the field will really help you pass EA-2L and EA-2F. Are they harder than FM and P? I am told they are.  I work for a small third party administrator.

actuary,39ultp,10nc,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:49:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks... at this point I am just completely unsure of what I want to do with my life, and becoming an actuary sounds like a pretty good option right now... I am worried that while having a great salary becoming an actuary would limit my growth past a certain point (salary and responsibilities). I am also wondering, how much time do you get off a year, and how many hours (studying and working) do you do a week usually?"
actuary,39ultp,10nc,2,Sun Jun 14 22:52:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think an actuarial role limits your growth: you can always switch to finance/product management/whatever managerial, but it's a great way to get into insurance/business.  There are several CEOs/CFOs that started as actuaries.  Time off/study hours vary a ton.  We get 300 study hours a year at my job (so almost 2 full months off of work for studying, though nobody I know takes their study hours that way obviously).  I work generally 35-40 hour weeks including study hours.  We get 20 days off a year plus 10 holidays.  But again, that's just me, other people have totally different situations."

actuary,39u35o,ejaculantern,17,Sun Jun 14 19:57:15 2015 UTC,I work in consulting and I cannot go ten minutes without talking to someone. To be honest I think the profession is trying to move away from the introverted stereotype.
actuary,39u35o,maptan,8,Sun Jun 14 20:13:45 2015 UTC,"To be honest I think the profession is trying to move away from the introverted stereotype.   Agreed, not just in consulting either."
actuary,39u35o,ActuarialGrape,2,Sun Jun 14 20:19:33 2015 UTC,Definitely! We deal a lot with actuaries in traditional insurance roles. Some are introverted and some are not but I think you would find this mix of people to be present in many office environments.
actuary,39u35o,maptan,2,Sun Jun 14 22:40:54 2015 UTC,Any tips for branching into consulting from more traditional actuarial roles?
actuary,39u35o,mathieforlife,2,Sun Jun 14 20:47:36 2015 UTC,"I went straight into consulting out of university so I may not be the best resource. My one thought is that consulting has a lot of turnover, people who leave after 2-3 years. As a result, we always tend to be short people with around 2-3 years of experience. If you're at this point in your career try sending out a resume."

I graduated from UW and got my current job through my co-ops. The consulting firms hire co-ops in their later terms so don't get discouraged.

actuary,39u35o,maptan,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:56:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I never went to ASNA or got involved in the Actsc club. The thing at Waterloo that speaks the most about you is your work experience. You're already off to a good start because you are working at an actuarial internship. I bet you can name classmates who have not yet had that opportunity.  As I gained experience through my co-ops and passed exams my time using jobmine got so much easier."
actuary,39u35o,mathieforlife,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:00:28 2015 UTC,"I always hated that haha, i've prided myself on my ability to talk, interact with people etc. But I guess those come up more in the interview, than getting the interview itself.  I did actsc club just to try to throw myself into the community a bit and learn from them cuz i switched in late from accounting and had no clue what I was doing,and companies seemed to be hiring more from ASNA lately so I thought why not.  It's all relative though, I'm sure you've seen how the competetive levels have been shot up lately (e.g. prelim pass times), and thoughjobmine has definitely gotten better for me than when  Ifirst started out, when Manulife is hiring 20-30 coops a term+sun life, london life etc etc, though there are tons who haven't had the opportunity, it's still pretty hard standing out :/"

Introverts will be introverts and extroverts will be extroverts, no matter the profession. The reason the actuarial field has a reputation for being introverted is because people who are good at math tend to be introverts. It's not the profession that's introverted. It's most of the people entering it. If you do not consider yourself one of these people, you will be fine."

actuary,39u35o,Epicwarren,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:09:35 2015 UTC,"Corporate P&C insurance intern here, I'm finding that my company and similar companies are looking more into making their environments more collaborative. Replacing cubicles with shared desks, more team assignments, etc. A bit part of this is a marketing-style push in corporations to recruit millennials, who are often attributed to preferring teamwork and less of a 9-5 office life. They have a big need for millennials, as evidence suggest a LOT of insurance professionals retiring in the next few years (source).  I say all this because while the other comments are saying ""just go consulting"", there is evidence to show that even insurance work is becoming more people-oriented. I'm assuming you're a young adult like me, and the standards have changed in our generation - we are much more extroverted in our work and crave teamwork talent, so companies are responding. It's a matter of finding the particular firm that has gotten with the program already, and has people you can enjoy life with."

However, average deferral rates have declined slightly from their peak of 7.3% in 2007.  The decine in average contribution rates is attributable to increased adoption of automatic enrollment.  While automatic enrollment increases participation rates, it also leads to lower contribution rates when default deferral rates are set at low levels, such as 3% or lower.

actuary,39lhlm,azim40,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:52:58 2015 UTC,"You aren't taking into account stock price increases. They increase proportionally with dividends in the dividend discount model. Therefore each year you will have the same annualized return because prices and dividends are increasing at a constant rate. I.e. even though you received a larger dividend, the beginning of year stock price is larger by the same factor, resulting in no annual return percentage increase no matter how many years the stock is held.  Edit: I do see how this is misleading because intuitively you jump to annualized holding period return on the stock, which is what I assume you calculated.  The question doesn't do a good job of explicitly saying ""annual rate of return on the stock"".  I wouldn't expect a poorly written question like this on an exam."
actuary,39lhlm,azim40,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:52:52 2015 UTC,"So basically, I just have to imagine that the stock is being sold and rebought every year?  Also, do stock prices ALWAYS increase proportionally with dividends? (Unless otherwise stated).   I wouldn't expect a poorly written question like this on an exam.   Well.. this question IS from a past exam! ;) But hopefully I won't get unclear ones on mine."
actuary,39lhlm,smthsmth,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:20:41 2015 UTC,"I believe, unless stated otherwise, you assume dividend discount model. So yes, if dividends increase, stock price increases.    Many edits: I take back what I said about the wording.  This is holding period return as well. You could solve for annual rate of return taking into account gain on sale of stock and dividends paid (solving for i and finding future value of previous dividends at time of sale). The way they worked it is just much easier for constantly increasing dividend and stock price."

The guy at Prometric doesn't have to abide by SOA rules. You do. With exam C, we have a list of formulas provided. This list appears on the screen during the exam. If the guy at Prometric prints it out for us, we are still not allowed, per the SOA, to use it. Because the tutorial is a Prometric thing, not an SOA thing, taking notes before the timer for your exam starts is essentially going into the exam with a formula sheet, as far as the SOA is concerned.

It's just a matter of putting in the time, which you'll still need to do if you put them off. Speaking from experience, it's damn near impossible to find actuarial work without an internship, and to have a good chance of getting one you'll want to have at least one exam passed by recruiting season this fall. Going to grad school isn't necessary if you want to be an actuary, and it's not as beneficial as you might expect.  In the US, actuarial assistants usually start in the high $50k to low $60k range, more in high cost of living areas, less for some companies (GEICO starts you in the low $50k range, for example)."

If for no other reason, if an interview per 10 applications were anywhere near typical, the chance of only getting one interview in ~180 (like I have) would be absurdly low. I know other people who've had just as much trouble as me, too - though admittedly, that does include a couple people who did have internships.  There's definitely something to be said for just being in the right place at the right time, though. The one interview I got was from applying for a job that wasn't even looking for EL."

I will also qualify that I graduated from a small class, probably only 10 domestic students - and the lowest total for exams complete was 3.  Most of us graduated with 4-5.

actuary,39iw4i,Andy06r,4,Fri Jun 12 14:09:48 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that majoring in Actuarial Science is a waste of time. The point of an Actuarial Science program is to hold your hand through the prelims. I majored in Math and have a MUCH deeper knowledge of math and statistics than my coworkers who majored in Actuarial Science. If you aren't 100% certain about being an Actuary, I would major in something more broad (like Econ, Math, CS, whatever).  Edit: Another thing... many interviewers want to see skills that go beyond knowledge of the actuarial field. If you can demonstrate that you are capable of learning independently and passing exams, that exposure to a different field can ONLY help you."
actuary,39iw4i,daveyfck1,3,Fri Jun 12 01:08:54 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that all of this is totally dependent on the program. I majored in actuarial science, didn't take a single exam prep course, and took more upper-level stats courses than most stats majors. Majoring in actuarial science also gave me the flexibility to take more programming courses than I'd have been able to take as a math major.  Trying to make sweeping generalizations about actuarial science degree programs doesn't make much sense since they vary so much from school to school. It's important to look into the actual coursework for all the programs you're considering."
actuary,39iw4i,tf113,2,Fri Jun 12 20:40:04 2015 UTC,"I see people responding with this all the time. I would like to point out that the majority of my classes were not prep courses for the prelims. In fact, most of the prep courses were optional.  Majoring in Actuarial Science is what you make of it. I know many students who majored in AS and took higher level math courses over the prep courses, while learning about the industry / other skills from certain AS courses. Real Analysis, Topology, etc are great courses to take, and while you do have a deeper understanding of mathematics and statistics than some of your coworkers, you'll almost never need to use the skills acquired from those courses in your work.  That being said, I do think it can be beneficial to major in math/stats and pursue the ASA+ credentials. I just think it's a bit harsh to call the AS program a waste of time. Your claim that the AS program merely guides students through the prelims has probably been formulated based on what you've read online, and though it may be true for some programs, those programs are not indicative of great AS programs."
actuary,39iw4i,SofaKingAsian,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:21:15 2015 UTC,"Right?  I never understood the ""don't major in actsci"" circlejerk.  I think it's all of the old school people who didn't have that as an option in school.  Personally I think that some of the management, cs, finance, etc. courses that usually accompany an actsci degree are more beneficial than real analysis and other advanced math courses.  Most actuaries work in an office environment and should therefore know more about business if they aspire to move into upper management.    Also, those that argue that an actsci degree is useless in other fields are also incorrect.  It would be pretty easy to articulate your knowledge of economics, finance, stats, whatever in an interview or even on a cover letter.  Do they think every actsci graduate who stalls on exams is unemployed or something?"
actuary,39iw4i,azim40,0,Fri Jun 12 19:11:53 2015 UTC,"I just graduated last year and actsci was an option for me. It was probably a little harsh of me to call it a ""waste of time"", but unless you are seriously committed to becoming an actuary any other related degree would be better. I would argue that it is easier to leverage a more broad degree into an actuarial position than it is to leverage an actuarial science degree into another field. It's much harder to explain to an interviewer how your skills are applicable if they've never even heard of AS.  Regarding the poster above you, I'm sure he's right. There are probably some truly great AS programs out there and I would agree that college in general is what you make of it. But my opinion is not formulated based on what I've read online. Many of my coworkers who majored in AS have a much more difficult time understanding complex math and statistics. Sure, they may have graduated from worse programs, but that's just my experience."

The program that I'm looking into is considered a Center of Actuarial Excellence by the SOA, so it seems like a very good program.  There does seem to be (based on course descriptions) a lot of emphasis on and teaching for exam prep (and they're all mandatory courses), which limits the amount of math/stat/econ courses that I can take - unless I want to be there for more than 4 years, which I don't.  I'd be taking more math courses with the minor in my current program choice than the actuarial major. I am more curious to find out how marketable a degree in actuarial science is assuming that I decide against becoming an actuary.  I'm leaning heavily toward the job of course but I also don't want to close off too many of my options."
actuary,39iw4i,randomjackal,3,Sat Jun 13 02:06:08 2015 UTC,"I did Econ (and Comp Lit--go figure), but if you have your sights set on actuary work, get a math major as well.

On the other hand, if you decide at some point to NOT be an actuary, the act-sci degree won't be nearly as much of an asset as a math degree.  EDIT: Comp Sci is good too!"

I've personally talked to TFA teachers, spent a day in an actual class, and read occasionally about it. I'd really encourage you to read up on the criticisms of TFA. Basically, they're the Wal-Mart of teaching. TFA would have you believe poor schools don't need more money to teach poor kids, they just need good teachers. If that were true, then why do rich people send their children to expensive schools with huge budgets? Are we to believe rich people are acting irrationally?  But more to your question: TFA will give you something to talk about in interviews, but not much more than volunteering a few hours each week to tutor. You could hypothetically become an ASA in two years, but in reality you'd likely be too stressed/over-worked/tired to study and pass any exams.  If you want to be an actuary you should study for an exam this summer/fall. You should start researching internships and be ready to apply ASAP in August.

Act sci won't give you near the thrill as the PhD. The five years might be worth it next to spending five years studying for exams and finding out you hate the career. Act sci is much less academic than beanactuary.org would lead you to believe and much more business oriented. Especially as automation and technology grows.

I would also argue that there are a healthy amount of actuaries who could see themselves doing engineering or CS in another life, so it's not an uncommon deviation.  Like you said, the money isn't an issue for either field, so what I'm seeing here is a subject you have a passion for with no downside but some extra classes.

In its most generic formulation, it belongs to the class of no-arbitrage models that are able to fit today's term structure of interest rates. It is relatively straightforward to translate the mathematical description of the evolution of future interest rates onto a tree or lattice and so interest rate derivatives such as bermudan swaptions can be valued in the model.  The first Hull–White model was described by John C. Hull and Alan White in 1990. The model is still popular in the market today.     Interesting: John C.

Actuarial science and data science are both very applied in most cases. The math is easy at that level. However they can both get pretty deep and theoretical (not on the exams). I wouldn't say one is a more challenging subject than another.
actuary,397j9v,ahnjuhla,2,Thu Jun 11 22:15:29 2015 UTC,Ultimately the goal is be happy with your job. Coming from a strict monetarial position I'm pretty sure actuaries average more. However money does not mean happiness (as you mentioned with work life). I'm sure you could find a job in both fields that are a joy and ones that are painful.    If you do change to cs there are companies that will like your actuarial background. We have some cs employees that have taken some exams.  So don't feel that you wasted your time. The study skills and thinking skills will be extremely helpful.

My company pays for the exam fees and materials all while I am earning a salary and building my 401k. There is absolutely no other career out there like actuarial.

My university had a program where aspiring teachers get teaching experience in actual schools right away in the first semester of freshman year, and every semester thereafter.   After my sophomore year, with the experiences I had, I realized I'm a mediocre teacher. Under any other circumstances I would've pushed through and tried to become better,  but due to circumstances in my family life, I couldn't risk trying to become better and being miserable in a job with very little pay.   I needed to switch to a career that would make more money,  and when I heard about my school's actuarial science program and realized I wouldn't have to stay another year (because most major switchers do), it was an easy decision"

Loss aversion and the sunk cost fallacy of article  Sunk costs:       Many people have strong misgivings about ""wasting"" resources (loss aversion). In the above example involving a non-refundable movie ticket, many people, for example, would feel obliged to go to the movie despite not really wanting to, because doing otherwise would be wasting the ticket price; they feel they've passed the point of no return. This is sometimes referred to as the sunk cost fallacy. Economists would label this behavior ""irrational"": it is inefficient because it misallocates resources by depending on information that is irrelevant to the decision being made. Colloquially, this is known as ""throwing good money after bad"".

Rational economist types would say that I should quit right now, but personally I'd feel pretty bad having invested 5 years of my life into something like a phd and not even getting an arguably useless paper for it.

You could also calculate this as an annuity due but would have to adjust for the last payment (add 1), since the formula doesn't include a payment on that date."

Personally I have always used only annuity due because one of my colleagues said those are easiest to work with when you get to mlc(which is true). I then just discount the pv/av if I need annuity immediate.  So I guess my advice is just look at t and work it with whichever annuity you like best and discount/accumulate as needed

actuary,3911nw,smthsmth,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:26:41 2015 UTC,"You have to pay attention to when the payments start and at what time you calculate the accumulated value. For instance in this problem, you are depositing 1200 at the beginning of each year, yet the problem asks what the value is exactly 11 years after the first payment. Most annuity due problems I've seen have payments start at the beginning of the year but ask for the accumulate value at the end of some year. Hope this helps!"
actuary,3911nw,StewpidNick,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:01:09 2015 UTC,"recognize: if it is a pv problem and constant term that is not ""moved"" then it is annuity due, if it is a fv problem and there is a constant term that is not ""moved"" it is s angle n, if all are moved then s double dot angle n. if all terms are ""moved"" in a pv problem then it is a angle n. by moved i mean either accumulated (1+i)n or decremented by vn.  btw: you wrote s angle 12, it should be s angle 11, ASM recommends counting by adding the ratio of the terms to the last term, minus the first term and divide by ratio. 2015->2016, 2016-2005= 11, 11/1=11. easy pnimonic for me to remember counting inclusive is #Z, z e [0,10] = 11. how many numbers are there from 0-10? 11."

actuary,38yuct,blackscholes69,3,Mon Jun 8 02:09:02 2015 UTC,"If you're on the SOA side, it sounds like you might enjoy exam C, just FYI.  Interestingly, the SOA just cited some research from The Economist (warning: PDF direct link) that says, among other things,    There is an apparent skills gap in the area of predictive modelling and advanced analytics. Predictive analytics is an important area of growth for employers of actuaries, increasingly underscoring competitive advantages by driving improvements in areas such as product design and risk management, as well as sales and marketing. But primary research indicates that employers do not think that actuaries come equipped with enough knowledge of and experience with the quantitative tools for the predictive modelling function. Statisticians and computer science graduates are generally sought out to fill the core modelling roles. Employers see actuaries as valuable in providing the industry context to tie the models to business value, helping to develop the correct models and then communicating, liaising, and interpreting the model outputs. But many employers suggested that actuaries need a stronger understanding of the models and how they work in order to fill these positions. The predictive modelling function is most advanced in the P&C space, though Healthcare is quickly catching up. Actuaries with a few years of experience in predictive modelling units or working with large datasets (particularly sector-specific datasets) are highly prized and reportedly difficult to find.    So it sounds like you're headed in the right direction, at least in the long term.  The exams may be an extreme handicap in the medium-term, though."

If not you can always do a combined Actuarial Studies/Commerce degree so if the actuarial job market doesn't look promising you can still go for other jobs in e.g. finance etc"
actuary,38w9eb,spagheric,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:08:12 2015 UTC,I'd say yes. But you need to build your skills and experience during uni and not just study - i.e. heaps of extracurriculars and try to get an internship in your penultimate year. Job prospects are good to those who earn it.  (i'm from Australia too)

There is no reason why you couldn't begin the process of switching careers, but 6 months to find and el job would be difficult. You'll probably need to pass at least two exams. Assuming you haven't started studying yet, you'll need that long to get through the first two, passing both on the first try. Then you've got to figure it will take a while to actually land some interviews and get that first job.   Do you live in a large metropolitan area that has a lot of companies that employ actuaries? That would be helpful unless you and your SO are prepared to move.  Have you visited actuarial outpost.com? You can read for days about career changers like yourself (and me 7 years ago.)  It's definitely harder now than in the past to enter the field, but you have some experience that would be an advantage if you went into the health side."

As expected, we find that real return estimates by DB public pension funds are positively related to fund size, fund age, international asset diversification, state income, and corruption levels. However, more interestingly and importantly, we document that real return estimates by public US DB pension funds are positively related to cultural measures of individualism and masculinity, and negatively related to uncertainty avoidance"

Plus, on days I had class, even with a 45 minute commute and 9ish hours at school I got home early enough to fit in a practice exam at night. I even managed to go out with friends every other weekend after studying, sometimes both Friday and Saturday.  As to what I was thinking....it didn't make sense to take fewer credits, I had to make rent, and I had to take exams if I wanted to be an actuary, so I really didn't have much of a choice other than to grin and bear it and remind myself that that'd all be over with soon. That said, I know people who work harder and make a hell of a lot less progress from it - in the grand scheme of things, I could've been far worse off.

I probably didn't go with the most efficient study method for C - I didn't really retain the material well when I took practice quizzes (i.e. 10 similar problems in a row) on subjects I was having trouble with, so I just took practice exams until I knew every section well enough - meaning I went through problems I already knew how to do over and over and over again. It worked, and I did have more free time at that point, but god did that get boring. Still, I'm not totally convinced there'd be a ""good"" way to study for C, at least for me.

I got lucky when the CEO asked my actuary boss for a report that she had no time to do. I self appointed myself to do it and even though it was seriously error ridden it was good initiative and according to the boss it saved her at least 2 weeks of work. We were able to complete the report, the ceo loved it which made my boss love me in return, which made her to stop seeing me as an intern, which led to get a contract this week to stay on board.

For the LHS, that's pretty obvious; the RHS gets there by taking the amount actually in the account, and adding the additional amount that would have been in the account if the withdrawals hadn't been made.  It might be more intuitive to set it up as  10000*1.0410 - [1.05K(1.046+1.045)+K(1.044+1.043)] = 10000  so the actual amount in the account (10000) is the FV of the initial deposit (10000*1.0410) minus the FV of the withdrawals (1.05K(1.046+1.045)+K(1.044+1.043))."

The equation should have everything on the left hand side with opposite signs and only 10,000 on the right.  That would represent the amount fully earned (had it been left in the bank) minus the withdrawal 1.05K times the years of interest lost and minus the withdrawal K times the years of interest lost (try distributing the ""K""s and see if it makes more sense).  10,0000(1.04)10 -1.05K(1.046 + 1.o45) - k(1.044 + 1.043) = 10,000  Or alternatively (with the distributions):  10,0000(1.04)10 -1.05Kx1.046 - 1.05Kx1.o45 - kx1.044 - kx1.043 = 10,000  2) This question is answered once the above suggestion is followed.

From what I understand this is the 2nd best market for actuaries (The first being New England area).  I passed Exam P and Exam FM 3 months apart.  This actually was a talking point in some of my interviews.  I made sure to develop my excel/programming skills and made this clear on my cover letter and resume.  I had an entire section on my resume describing 2 different excel projects I had made that read almost like job descriptions.  I made sure to high light my knowledge of vlookup, sumif, and pivottables.  A former co-worker of mine also transitioned to actuary after 6.5 years of teaching.  He wasn't getting any bites on his resume until he edited it to include mention of specific excel functions like vlookup and sumif.  We speculated that companies were filtering resumes with these keywords (among other things).  For what it's worth, I had a B.S. in math education from a big ten school, as well as a master in curriculum and instruction.  Both had about 3.8 GPA.  My recommendation (as I believe this is what helped me) is to pass P as planned and aim to pass FM in Oct (same months I did it).  Have a resume and cover letter ready to start applying to jobs after your second pass.  I did this and had a job offer by Thanksgiving.  Make sure your cover letter explains why you want to switch now and that you're looking to stick with actuarial work.  Don't bash your current job/profession, just make it clear that if they hire you you're not going to change your mind 6 months in.  Do some humble bragging as well (e.g. Passed Exam P with a 10 on your first attempt).  Again, make sure your resume and cover letter mention your abilities in excel/vba and that your are working to improve them.   Feel free to PM me if you get stuck on any exam stuff, too :-)"

actuary,38jd4d,gatsbys_dream,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:50:38 2015 UTC,"For what its worth, people would probably be more impressed with an index/match knowledge than vlookup. I'd probably just leave that off the resume all together though and save it for the interview."

actuary,38joh5,sozzZ,5,Thu Jun 4 23:58:25 2015 UTC,It's actually quite relevant so don't worry. Get a solid grip on SQL and using ms sql server and you got a great marketable skill for an EL position.

I am currently an Accounting major and i've taken a few finance classes so I actually have a decent understanding of TVM, I looked at a random example from some website of a FM example problem, and although I didn't solve it I knew the concepts of what it was asking and how to go about solving it (minus one formula I was unaware of)"

For some people, it would be less due to just how smart they are. So I would think that it would be possible, but it would be very difficult. It depends on how fast of a learner you are and how hard you're willing to work I would think."

I passed P on the first try and put in about 150 hours including 22 practice exams (that alone is 66 hours)  I have never heard of needing 500 hours for P or FM.

After tutoring basically every 200 level and below class in my uni ten times, I know every basically every calculus and algebra trick.

Same thing with insurance cashflow projection software programming. I've worked in pricing and ALM and after a while it's all the same to me, and you have to deal with other people's horrible code, and sometimes you have to write horrible code because of ridiculous time constraints and the fact you're adding code on top of other people's horrible code, and you have to live with the fact that you have to produce horrible code. I'm doing some work in R right now about policy holder behavior which is pretty interesting but same thing about the time and resource constraints, can't really make the final product as good as I want regardless of how much overtime I put in.

I signed up for ChemEng coming in and after sophomore year decided to switch. I knew the exams would be a bitch, but that life would be pretty easy thereafter.  Don't get 'shoe-horned' into the career, that's asking for unhappiness;  make it a conscious decision and go into whichever career full force. What fulfills you?

So basically what you're saying is that we can predict future stock prices and form confidence bands using the random walk procedure (which wouldn't predict up or down, just a range, because it's a random walk).  That's kinda what we covered in my TS class - part of the class was a project where we had to forecast the stock market. We got points for trying, not for doing it - because our professor told us you really can't forecast if it's going to go up or down, you can just form a range.

You won't miss out on anything going to one over the other.   Grade inflation/deflation isn't a secret, you don't possess some intimate knowledge nobody else has. Recruiters know this and if they don't, it's their ignorance not your grades holding you back. Having higher grades could be just as detrimental according to your rationale.

Side advice from a classmate that was really helpful: he said the fact that everyone's been telling me to go to Berkeley and yet I've been so hesitant to commit shows that deep within LA is what I want--and reading your response just reaffirmed it--I know the answer, it's just been me holding me back (sucha cheesy 80s fighter movie cliche but relevant)  Also: I'm still open to responses from anyone, this doesn't mean thread closed!

actuary,37uxzd,twaggerz,7,Sat May 30 16:42:36 2015 UTC,No one can answer this question for you and it sounds like you know the pros and cons.  I ha a similar decision to make at EL and opted industry - mostly because there was more exam support and I figured that I could also go consulting after attaining my fellowship but it's really up to you. Big four doesn't just fall in your lap very often so that should be a consideration.
actuary,37uxzd,jenkinsear,3,Sat May 30 18:59:11 2015 UTC,"You may also want to consider how good you are about studying outside of work. I used to work in life pricing and am currently at a Big 4 firm. I personally found it much easier to get and prioritize study hours when I was in insurance than where I am at now. In the end, the actuarial career progression comes down to the exams. That being said, you will find success and fail stories in either industry so it does come down to your personality."
actuary,37uxzd,Efu,3,Sat May 30 20:05:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry too much about being 'worked harder' at a Big 4 firm. You choose how much you want to work. If you choose to work 15 hour days for an entry level salary, that is on you. I don't think you should make a decision based on how hard you think you will work in either role.  I think one of the main points to consider is the 'soft skills' aspect of consulting. Although you won't be expected to demonstrate too much at an analyst level, progressing in a consulting environment will require you to hone your soft skills alongside your technical skills. Some people find that unappealing, in which case I imagine they prefer corporate where they can get away with being a dedicated technical resource.  The other point you already mentioned, which is the breadth of exposure versus depth of exposure. Only you know which of those sounds better to you.  Last point: I'm not sure which system of exams you are writing but I presume it is the US system. In the UK system, pricing experience is generally less useful for passing exams, in comparison to reserving experience. That isn't a hard-and-fast rule and I don't know how applicable it is for the US system, but maybe someone else here can comment."

actuary,37uxzd,spartanburt,2,Sun May 31 11:44:50 2015 UTC,"I would say take the consulting job.  Why do I feel qualified to answer your question you wonder?  Because I've done both, that's why.  I actually changed careers into actuarial science, at a time when hiring was pretty quiet, so I found it very difficult to even get interviews; I took the only job I was offered, after a long search, which was an analyst at one of the big 4.  It was one of the worst experiences of my life, but hear me out.  I started off cycle (in February) instead of with the new college grads, so I didn't really have a peer group to compare things with (like what reasonable expectations are, when it's ok to say no, etc.) and I didn't go through the formal training with the rest of them until July.  I am someone who has trouble saying no and I got crushed.  Another thing working against me is that instead of having one busy season like most people, I happened to have a mix of clients where my work peaked twice a year, right before the spring and fall exam sittings.  Again, I realized too late that I should have protested this.  I also had a terrible people manager (he was widely regarded as the worst).  It wasn't until a couple years in that I realized the other managers scheduled regular meetings to check up on their employees.  Timesheets didn't come naturally to me, but I found that they didn't seem to bother the kids that didn't come from an industry without them.  All the more reason to start off with them.  The people in the big 4 are really fun.  There are endless happy hours, trivia nights, sports leagues, etc.  And they are legitimate alcoholics.  Maybe a large insurance company in the city is similar, I don't know, but from what I saw consultants seemed to have the most fun by far.  If at some point you get sick of exams and decide to pour your energies elsewhere (either professionally or not) you'll be way better off in consulting.  Some insurance companies will actually fire you for not keeping up with exams, but if that's not the case, there just won't be as much opportunity.  My reasons for leaving were 1. That I didn't want to work in pensions, 2. Totally burned out from working and angry for killing my exam progress (more on that later) and 3.  I came down with some very serious health issues and I just couldn't maintain the schedule.  I know a lot of consultants will say they'll never go back, but I don't quite share that sentiment.  I've never shied away from a lot of work, but looking back I realized just how horribly inefficient and poorly managed that office was.  It was the amount of pointless work that bothered me.  I mentioned that health issues contributed to my burnout; I would have really like to hold out for a better consulting gig, one that was up to date on software and filing practices, one that had a better culture of sharing work, one that paid OT or otherwise recognized the harder workers, but I had a serious eye condition and I was in an extreme hurry to downsize.  Now that I'm in insurance, I do enjoy the lighter load, but I'm not as generally happy or optimistic about the future now.  There are great insurance companies out there I'm sure, but I'd say at least start in consulting if you have the chance."
actuary,37uxzd,broilking,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:48:17 2015 UTC,"I agree that this is a tough decision and I would base it on what you value for the first couple years of your full-time career. Working at an insurance company can give you some guaranteed experience in a certain field, as well as enough time/support to complete your actuarial exams. In a consulting firm, you'll gain a variety of exposure, but the type of exposure will not be guaranteed. For example, it's possible that you could spend a lot of time working on work that isn't exactly actuarial (ex. project management). Not saying that isn't valuable, but at an insurance company you KNOW that you'll be learning from the base up for whichever department you're in. Nevertheless, I think most people will agree that 2 years at a consulting company will teach you more than 2 years in insurance.   Part of the reason for that is the hours, like you mentioned. Hours will be longer and more irregular at a consulting firm, and if you take any study days, you'll likely have to make up for that by working harder in the following days (since work is very deadline driven).   Both are great opportunities, but if I really had to choose one to start off in (I've had experience in both), I would choose consulting. You'll get to work with a lot of talented people and you'd learn a lot more in terms of soft skills as well (from giving presentations, meeting clients, etc.). Your first few years of full-time will be harder, but it'll pay off if/when you transition over to an insurance company."
actuary,37uxzd,sozzZ,1 point,Sat May 30 23:45:03 2015 UTC,"Are both the positions in life or is one p&c? Honestly, I'd probably go for the insurance company because it's more laid back and you're guaranteed to get your study hours in generally."
actuary,37uxzd,peterxyz,1 point,Sun May 31 01:05:16 2015 UTC,The position in the big 4 is a graduate program so whether the work is related to life or not depends on the projects that come in I guess. I think they would mainly be GI and health from what I've heard
actuary,37uxzd,SixMileDrive,1 point,Sun May 31 10:55:46 2015 UTC,"well then consider that you're also deciding between types of insurance - which one appears.

actuary,37scgn,bisonlover444,19,Sat May 30 00:14:37 2015 UTC,"For a little more detail, with some attempt to be objective: The SOA leadership, in general, wants to expand internationally.  Emerging markets need actuaries, and the SOA wants to expand to those markets in order to credential their actuaries.  This makes sense, as there's a lot of institutional knowledge in the SOA, so these markets don't need to develop their own actuarial institutions.  CAS wants to partner with new institutions in those markets, but does not want to take a leading role in creating them.  These markets don't just need life, health, and pension actuaries - they need P&C actuaries too.  Without a P&C path, the SOA can't really expand into those markets.  So, they wanted to combine with the CAS to get that P&C path.  CAS says no.  So the SOA decides to independently offer a P&C track (general insurance) with a credential - FSA-GI.  This is the start of the slapfight.  SOA uses the CAS directory to blast email the CAS membership and offer members the ability to  get a free FSA in addition to their FCAS. SLAP!  CAS responds, saying it is against the terms of service for the directory to be used that way.  They bring ABCD charges against the President of the SOA. SLAP!  He sues the CAS and ABCD.  SLAP!  AAA steps in, and says that the FSA-GI credential by itself is not good enough to sign SAOs for P&C.  SLAP!  SOA threatens to sue the AAA, saying that the FSA-GI is a good credential, and by not recognizing it they are violating anti-trust rules.  SLAP!  AAA, responding to the threatened lawsuit, kicks SOA members off the board.  SLAP!  I probably missed some suits and countersuits there, but that's the gist of it.  I agree with the position of the SOA leadership that the profession should grow and consolidate internationally, but their actions have been extremely unprofessional."

First they tried to make it so you could be credentialed without ever taking an exam/by a college degree. Then they became power hungry wanting to takeover the CAS. Then they went after the AAA, after the AAA said their new credential wouldn't qualify for regulatory purposes.  The CAS would work with them again, but there's still some cray cray people running the place.  Go ahead and register for P. While the SOA cray cray people don't like us, we still like the SOA. The SOA members can't directly vote to put people on the ballot and elect them to office. I don't know how it works exactly."

actuary,37qygz,tf113,2,Fri May 29 19:58:31 2015 UTC,"The p-value does not have anything to do with the probability distribution of any value of interest. It represents P(Data | H_0), not P(H_0 | Data).  Take what was probably the first example of hypothesis testing you saw in Stats 101 - we have measurements of some statistic based on samples from two populations, and we want to know whether the two population means are different. The p-value is not the probability that the two populations have different means. The p-value is the probability that we would observe the results we did if the two populations have the same mean. We have no idea as to the actual probability that the two populations have different means.  Similarly, in the case of the chi-squared test, we have no idea as to the probability that our data actually follows the distribution we're testing against. All we can do is say, ""Let's assume it does follow that distribution. What's the probability of observing values that deviate this far from that distribution?"" That probability is the p-value.  The reason we can't let H_0 be ""the population our data comes from is not Poisson distributed with mean 2"" is closely tied to the fact that we always calculate p-values based on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. If all you're assuming is that the population is not Poisson distributed with mean 2, it could follow any other distribution. You can't calculate p-values, or other associated probabilities, without knowing (or assuming) the distribution you're calculating those probabilities from."

It's just the average for people with a master's degrees. There are other graphs that break it out by years of experience and highest degree. They break it out by managerial responsibility and they list 75k for the median salary if you have no managerial responsibilty (with a Master and 0-5 years experience) and 80k for the median (with a Master and 0-5 years experience). Which page did you find the 120k with 0-2 years experience and a master? The 0-2 that I see does not break it out by degree and has 75k as the median.

I felt similarly myself when I was going through exams (3-8 years ago), but I don't think ""it was easier back then"" is supported by any hard evidence.  edit: I do agree though that pass rates of upper level exams vary too much to form good conclusions (without a lot of analysis)"

Perhaps one of the more objective ways would be for current candidates to do practice problems chosen from both 2015 sitting and 2000 sitting, on questions based on papers that are exactly the same from both sittings, and see how they do. I think one thing that /u/toofpik didn't point out is that while Bloom's make it ""harder"" since you have to understand concepts for sure instead of just memorizing facts, they also accept more answers, including those that you need only broad knowledge of (maybe even outside of studying).

In the end, it will just make me a better actuary than I otherwise would be and will help to preserve my salary. I'm simply trying to look at this as objectively as possible.  Now to my point: I don't have evidence by way of any sort of statistical study to definitively say that an exam offered in 2015 would be more difficult than an exam offered in 2007. Measuring 'difficulty' would be tough to even unitize, quantify and then objectively measure; you would only be able to get at this information through qualitative responses or subjective, non-standardized quantitative responses. Frankly, I don't need to conduct a study and neither does anyone else. You could simply take a pre-2011 exam and compare it any post 2010 exam and decide for yourself and attempt to put any personal bias aside in doing so.   Further, and more importantly, the incentive is there for credentialed actuaries to make the exams more difficult; it preserves their salary -- they would be foolish not to implement such changes with the influx of candidates. I don't like to speculate here but I will, I'd bet that this is at least part of the reason this conducted in the first place.  Let's entertain your idea though. If I were to conduct a survey, I would literally bet my life on this outcome (your's too): If you had 100 CAS credentialed actuaries that work in ratemaking take one historical version of Exam 5 offered from 2007-2010 and also had them take an exam offered in either 2011 or from 2013-2015, and then asked these individuals which exam was more difficult, an overwhelming majority would say that the exam administered in 2011 or from 2013-2015 was more difficult."
actuary,37n0g5,toofpik,1 point,Fri May 29 21:55:33 2015 UTC,"The 2011 pass rates were lower. I have an indifference in saying that the 2010 exam vs the 2012 or 2013 exam was harder.  If I were to give a personal opinion, I'd say the 2013 exam was longer but not harder. I might even lean towards easier.  2011 and 2012 were more difficult due to there not being a bank of questions to pull from. The examiners report holds a tremendous amount of value. That wasn't offered prior to 2012 I believe. The examiners report has made understanding how to answer things a lot more transparent and easier.   2011 due to the low pass rates are some of the hardest exams in years. They had the lowest pass rates in decades including every exam offered after. 2014 had some of the highest pass rates seen. There was a concerted effort to move the pass mark up. Unfortunately comparing pass marks doesn't tell you much, I think pass rates give some insight.  For prelims I think there's a consensus that they were the most difficult in the late 90s and early 00s.  Generally speaking the further you go back the easier things will always seem. The new exam materials always hit the oldest stuff first. Those older questions make up the base of your knowledge when studying. Chances are those older questions have been tested in subsequent years in various ways, further making them seem easy."
actuary,37n0g5,TheLincolnMemorial,1 point,Fri May 29 23:58:22 2015 UTC,"You made the claim that they implemented higher levels of Bloom's taxonomy in order to artificially increase the difficulty of exams to prevent a glut of mid-level candidates (i.e. are artificially restricting supply).  Whether or not the new questions cover more material or are ""subjectively harder"" (which is what would be determined by your proposed survey) doesn't actually matter to your claim.  If they were attempting to restrict supply, they would be attempting to lower the number of people taking the exams (which hasn't happened) and/or pass rate (which hasn't happened).  It would be far easier and far more effective for them to restrict the supply by raising the passing score, causing more people to fail.  Why is the CAS stated reason for the changes to exams not enough? I.e. that the previous ""lower Bloom level"" tests were not as useful in preparing actuaries for their future roles as they could be.  Your claim is also opposite to my experience in the SOA, where the leadership has continually gone out of their way to simplify the exam process and to offer easier credentials. They actually eliminated a few exams and replaced with a series of incredibly easy modules. The SOA, at least, is definitely not restricting supply in the way you said the CAS is.  Why doesn't your ""it's in their best interest"" reasoning apply to the SOA?  I also think that your opinion that you deserve a better credential than people who got their credentials 5+ years ago is extremely conceited."

This tightness appears also driven by a skillset mismatch: at this level, employers are looking for actuaries with a balanced toolkit, who have demonstrated leadership, managerial and communication skills; reports suggest that it can be difficult to find the right mix of these non-quantitative skills."""

You said you know stats, being able to talk briefly about normal distribution, lognormal distribution, expected value, and variance/standard deviation might be handy.  You also might want to familiarize yourself with the general idea of pricing insurance.  I had a question regarding it in one of my interviews.  The jist is that the premium clients pay needs to cover the expected losses, the costs of handling claims, other business costs (building maintenance, taxes, etc.) and desired profit.  Since the expected loses are difficulty to know when the premium is set, we use statistic and probability to estimate as best as possible what that portion of the costs should be.  The idea of collecting and analyzing credible data to predict an expected loss per policy and increasing that amount to cover other expenses and profit was sufficient enough to answer the question asked during my interview.  It sounds like you should be pretty fine with the Excel, but expressing knowledge of functions like vlookup, sumif, etc. usually helps as well.

I've come across Black-Scholes before. Not sure that my partial differentials are up to it, but I'll take another look.  One thing I was thinking about last night: insurance companies are in competition with each other; if that's price-based competition, then isn't it crucially important, not only to price risk, but to price it more accurately than the competition? Individual actuaries and their professional bodies may want to share knowledge - but do leading insurers do their best to keep their best models secret?"

Enter ""Like a good neighbor, state farm is there"" vs. ""Progressive - Our rates are so low, we'll show you the competitor rates"".  Some information is shared, some by legal obligation, other pricing methods are kept secret, like you said.  Plus different companies can  remain competitive to different demographics depending on what discounts, etc. are offered.  Remember most clients won't care about 'accurate' pricing, they'll care about cheaper pricing."

In the US, individual health insurance since the ACA has been extremely price-elastic because (1) people directly compare rates and choose coverage annually through the marketplace, (2) subsidies are directly based on market pricing, and they augment small rate differences from consumers' perspective, and (3) the ACA is fairly new and companies are still figuring out how to price based on it, leading to volatile pricing.

One friend had a US-based employer that didn't cover the tax, so he had the coverage dropped from his package. The only time I've seen it be useful is when a friend had a serious accident.

There's a little bit of flexibility beyond that - a lot of things legally have to be covered, but as long as you cover those things and pay out as much in claims (relative to premiums) as you're supposed to, you can structure coverage however you want. Note that a lot of specialty insurers have had to switch to more traditional products in order to be ACA-compliant.  The bare-minimum plans (actuarial value of 60% or more) are actually less significant than ""silver plans"" (actuarial value of 70%-80%), since (1) individuals' premium subsidies are based on the cost of the second-lowest-premium silver plan available to them, and (2) most people on silver plans qualify for further subsidies toward their deductibles, etc."

First off, if you want to become an actuary, a degree in math is a very good thing to have. As you've probably ascertained, being an actuarial student (someone taking exams) requires a fairly adept knowledge of math. Many people will tell you that you need to be a mathematical prodigy to be an actuary. This is a fallacy. As long as you're the type of person that studies hard, can think quickly, understand some basic mathematical formulas, and find the time to practice, you will pass exams. A math degree will bolster your ability to do this. It may even be overkill for the preliminary exams. Regardless, a degree in mathematics in not necessarily required (you will have many people tell you this. They do not know what they are talking about.) Generally, a STEM degree coupled with some knowledge of insurance and economics should do the trick. If you enjoy math though and are considering studying it, go for it! You'll be a very valuable candidate for a lot of jobs (actuarial or not) with a mathematics degree.  As far as an actuarial science major, it can be a blessing or a curse. As many people mentioned, if you don't want to become an actuary (your interests will change over time. Trust me.) it may hurt you when applying for other jobs. Secondarily, a degree in actuarial science may get a mixed response from some hiring managers. Some may view you as a highly polished candidate with a great knowledge of the field. This can land you a job. Some may view you as a more generic acturial candidate with mixed incentives.  The actuarial career track in a war of attrition for the first 6-10 years. To become a full-fledged fellow, you will need to pass 9 exams and complete several modules. This takes thousands of hours of effort outside of work. That being said, they are looking for someone with a great deal of commitment and self-motivation. That being said, and at risk of sounding overly critical, which candidate would you hire?  A. Johnny with a degree in Math from NYU. He passed three exams during his undergrad because he is a passionate, self-reliant person who has a long term goal in mind.   B. Sam with a degree in Actuarial Science from the University of Averagequerque. He passed three exams during his undergrad because he needed to to graduate.  This is hyperbole, but it can illustrate the mindset of some hiring managers that need to differentiate between nearly identical candidates. Most candidates with actuarial science degrees do make great candidates for jobs however. You just don't want to fall into the ""I need to study X in order to do Y"" trap.  In short, there are just three other things you need to know.   You should go to the best school FOR YOU and study what you want. Don't compromise the education you'll have for a life time because stupid people tell you stupid things. If you can get into MIT or Harvard and want to go, go for it. If you don't want to, don't loose sleep over it. Just make yourself a competitive person. Learn some economics and programming languages. Explore in college if you can. Don't get bent out of shape if your grades in college aren't as high as the English Major that lives down the hall."
actuary,37jd8a,JessyHeisenburgh,1 point,Thu May 28 23:54:57 2015 UTC,"Wow! Thanks for such a great response!  You may have seen in my other responses, but I would like to go for math but still consider being an actuary as a possible career plan (and according to you and others this a perfectly reasonable thing to do).    Now, if you don't mind me asking, what major did you go for? And also, was your original plan to become an actuary, or did you have something else in mind that eventually changed to the actuarial path?  Thanks again for the detailed response!   Also, my brother is an English major and may or may not have some words about the ease of his coursework hahaha"
actuary,37jd8a,JessyHeisenburgh,2,Fri May 29 14:25:10 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! It was a pleasure to write it. That sounds like a great plan so far. I'm two years out of college myself. The best advice I can give is start studying something with a purpose (like math) and try it out. In college, I double majored in Biology and Economics. I loved science and strongly considered going down the Pre-Med track. I was at a top national university so the curve for pre-med became very steep very quickly. I maintained halfway decent grades but med-school wasn't an option. Given my science background and the analytical skills behind it, I decided to transition into an economics major to give a greater sense of practicality to those skills for the job market. I've had the idea of trying to become an actuary in the back of my mind for several years. I initially ruled it out because I thought my background was inappropriate for the field, but I decided to pursue it seriously about a year ago after speaking with some individuals who were established in the field. Haha well I'm sure his coursework is very difficult. I'm never one to pick on English majors for their work ethic. Essentially what I was trying to say is that STEM fields usually give lower grades than fields involving liberal arts. So if you here of someone saying that they have a 3.8 or a 3.9 as an English major, and you don't have that as a Math major, don't sweat it because you're not doing anything wrong."
actuary,37jd8a,bisonlover444,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:53:35 2015 UTC,"You're on a roll here with these great responses!  Anyway, very interesting double major in Biology and Economics.  I'm glad to hear it's all working out for you.  Math is going to be the route I take (so far) as I enjoy it and I know I can do something with it, no matter what.  And yes, I agree that the grades for the two subjects do not exactly match up completely and my brother would most likely agree!  I hope you don't mind me continuing with questions, but have you started looking for a job as an actual actuary/assistant or are you in the transitional period still where you're just studying and passing tests to start getting involved?  Thanks again!"
actuary,37jd8a,eriktheguy,3,Mon Jun 1 19:02:48 2015 UTC,"Hello! Currently a college senior majoring in Actuarial Science. To my understanding, majoring directly in ActSci can be a bad thing if you decide down the road you don't want to be an actuary. Actuarial employers will hire math, stat, finance, business, even biology majors, but other fields don't necessarily hire actsci majors. I found a way around it (though possibly crazy) with my university's actsci program. We have certain minors nearly built into our actsci major, so by taking just one extra accounting class, I have a finance minor, one extra econ class and I get an econ minor. So on and so forth, I now have 5 minors in Spanish, Econ, Finance, Math, and Business Analytics.  I would like to also point out that there are plenty of actuaries who majored in something completely unrelated to math and pass the exams without prior math education (beyond the basic required whatever). Not sure if I really answered your question to the fullest degree, but that's my 2 cents. If you decide to major in math, maybe take a few classes on the side pertaining to where in the actuarial field you would like to go. For example, I plan to go into Healthcare, so I have registered to take an Economics of Healthcare course within the next year at my university (which conveniently fits my requirements for the additional econ minor I'm pursuing!)  Best of luck!!"
actuary,37jd8a,ExceLestial,2,Thu May 28 01:44:18 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's an interesting system at your school.  I'm probably going to just major in math and like you said maybe take some classes on the side pertaining to actuarial science, as I'd imagine that can only be a benefit.  Thanks for such a detailed response and best of luck to you too! I've heard healthcare is a great field to go into as people always need it so good luck!"
actuary,37jd8a,TrueBlonde,2,Thu May 28 10:30:54 2015 UTC,"Go into math unless you're sure you want to be an actuary.  I did a Master's in math without knowing what an actuary was and then decided full stop to get out of the PhD track and had little idea what I would do for my career.  1 year and 3 exams later, I was employed as an actuarial student and making about twice what I did as a graduate student with a good NSERC grant.  But most people who went to school for Act Sci tell me the same thing, the program is basically about preparing you for exams and jobs. If you are interested in math for math's sake, just go to school for that and you can still easily go into Act Sci or a dozen other fields when you finish."
actuary,37jd8a,estrellez,1 point,Thu May 28 04:32:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, that sounds like a good plan if I stick with math as a major.  I'm not truly positive I want to be an actuary--I'm pretty indecisive--and I was sort of treating is as something to do should I want to settle into a career and not do grad school etc.  Thanks a lot for the response, best of luck with your career!"
actuary,37jd8a,notGWBush,3,Thu May 28 10:22:38 2015 UTC,"If you're also considering grad school then majoring in math would be your best bet. An actuarial science major is not necessary and most people online actually look down upon it. The biggest benefit that an actuarial science major would bring you is networking. You'll be alongside other aspiring actuaries and have access to alums and most likely companies will specifically look to hire actuaries from your campus. Regarding exams, either is fine."
actuary,37jsjq,MoMerry,3,Thu May 28 03:28:28 2015 UTC,"I can give some input, i passed both P and FM this year   I found P to be a little trickier than FM. Plus, doing all those integrations and stuff was a pain in the ass. You'll learn soon that although there are many formulas in FM, you will be using your calculator like a goddamn wizard instead of those formulas. Also, the second part of FM, which is the Derivatives section, may seem daunting at first, but the questions on the actual exam are usually pretty easy. In short, FM is just a lot of alegbra combined with quick calculator fingers. I preferred that over some of the horrible integrals i had to do for P. As you go through the definitions, you'll realize they follow certain patterns that make them easier to memorize. And like i said, while you definitely should know all the definitions, you will eventually be able to use your calculator to solve all your basic annuity and bond problems by simply inputting the given info."

actuary,37gi4y,jyz002,2,Wed May 27 15:59:55 2015 UTC,"Location won't count against you if you're a good candidate.  Your prior experience has to show me, as a hiring manager, why I should call you over someone else.  At the entry level market, I realistically want someone I can tolerate, who can tie their own shoes, and who will actually think about the job as opposed to being an automaton that turns a crank.  If you can demonstrate that with your resume, it's likely I'd at least give you a call.   If whatever field you're coming from has any office/professional type exposure, you should not have a large disadvantage.  One problem is you may be off-cycle since a lot of companies are taking on soon, or just took on, entry level staff.  The market gets hotter as the college recruiting cycle turns back into gear in a few months.  I know that's not the best news, but it's better than nothing.   Also what /u/ShakeNBakes said is good advice - apply even if you don't meet the exact criteria.  The criteria are written for the perfect candidate and a lot of times, that candidate may not exist so the company will cast a wider net and see what they can find."

I do a lot of horse trading with my accounting department.  I consult with the product development team.  I work with claims.  I get asked questions from IT about my needs as a technology user.  I get to deal with our external auditors.  I get to manage projects with consultants.  I don't have a very routine job.  I could sit in front of the computer all day and sometimes have to, but that's rare.    What I find interesting is that there's a lot of puzzles to be solved.

actuary,375rjq,zech83,1 point,Mon May 25 13:01:09 2015 UTC,"I have always felt the computerized may be a little unfair this way. Some people seem to get more conceptual questions that one either knows or doesn't know and these free up time for other math intensive questions and therefor make the test easier in some ways. The counter argument is that if you don't know it then it is one less that you have the opportunity to work out. Would be interesting to pass rates given X amount of these questions. To be more specific I am thinking of graph questions and questions where they typically say which is true, I, II, III, IV, or some combination of those."
actuary,375rjq,TheHopefulActuary,2,Mon May 25 14:29:20 2015 UTC,Completely agree. On FM I had at least 5 concept questions in a row. Weird as hell.
actuary,375rjq,spartanburt,5,Fri May 29 05:10:42 2015 UTC,"When I worked in consulting failing exams was almost the norm for the spring sitting, because our busy season was Jan-March, give or take.  Hard to study when you're getting home at 9 or 10 pm and likely working at least half-time on weekends.  I know there was one girl who took 5 tries to pass C.  I know people who are in their 30's and still working on the prelims (as am I) who have gotten plenty of promotions, raises, even changed companies in the meantime.  Failed exams suck for sure, but it's not worth getting too worked up over, just keep at it."
actuary,375rjq,ShakeNBakes,1 point,Mon May 25 15:18:56 2015 UTC,At what age did you start taking exams? It seems a lot more common for people to stop at ASA or ACAS in consulting.
actuary,375rjq,spartanburt,3,Tue May 26 02:33:17 2015 UTC,"It is.  It's due to a mix of them being less necessary, due to the wide variety of projects, and the limit of how much of a beating the human body can take.  I'm not a great example.  I started at 25, passed the first 2 relatively easily on my own (no company study time since I was in a different industry).  Started in consulting at 27, only passed MFE and the SOA mods in the 3 years I was at that company.  Now I'm in insurance, and after seeing both extremes I realize I'll never like this profession and am currently planning my exit.  I figure I'll just take C so I have some stats clout for interviews.  I never really considered pursuing fellowship, even at the beginning.  The reason I said I'm not a good example for the travel time is that there were significant gaps along the way.  Like I said I was a career-changer, and at the time actuarial hiring was very quiet, and more and more colleges were adding it as a major, so after two exams it didn't seem wise to keep pouring time into them when it was far from guaranteed I would ever find a job in it.  Then when I was in consulting, I could have fought harder to protect my study time if I cared, but that place pretty much killed any love I had for the career.  I mentioned the typical busy season, but my clients were actually such that my peak work times were right before both the spring and fall sittings.  I mean they really effed me good, just through oversight, and I had who was widely regarded as the worst people manager in the company.  I knew my days there were numbered, I just didn't know what I'd do afterwards.  Halfway through my time there, I developed an eye condition that threatened my sight, so again, it seemed silly to pour time into these exams when a rather likely outcome I was facing was moving into my mom's basement to wait for my eyes to fail.  And I forgot to mention till now that because I changed careers, I had to go back and do a couple VEE's in that time frame as well.  So really, I don't mean to scare people into thinking the exams will take forever; if you really make them a priority they're doable.  My point was really that there are plenty of people who don't just fly through the exams, and failing a few here or there is quite par for the course.  TL;DR - I didn't mean to scare anyone into thinking they'd be taking exams till they're 35.  Those people either took long breaks or had other unique circumstances that brought them there.  Failed sittings are common but don't set you that far back at all time-wise, so long as you keep plowing through."

They do this so if we want to study with someone we can. I saw someone failed MFE 6 or 7 times before passing. These exams are a pain in the ass don't sweat it. Just keep going and going.

If you're getting that many interviews it means you're definitely a qualified candidate, which should be encouraging.  It sounds like you just need a little more practice and you should be all set."
actuary,374kyt,Ongg,-2,Sun May 24 21:14:21 2015 UTC,"I dont know how much more to practice though...Ive worked with my colleges career center to practice interviews, and ive asked my adviser for typical questions that companies would ask (he used to interview interns for many different companies) so im prepared for them.  And i make sure not to sound like a robot either. I memorize more of a flowchart of ideas that helps me highlight the most important parts of my resume. When certain questions are asked, i usually use the same stories each time, but i never memorize a scripted answer for that. I just say it how i remember it, but since ive told them so many times it usually flows pretty nicely.  Plus those 2 on campus jobs i have have me dealing with parents and professionals all the time, mostly informing them about what they need to know about our university. So im definitely used to dealing with people older than me and in higher positions. Im very easy going, and i always have my interviewers laughing somehow. I have an ""Interests"" section on my resume and they ALWAYS ask me about it, and i take the time to tell them funny stories of when i acted in my high school plays that always makes them laugh.  Dont even get me started on how much research i do on the company...i once contacted an employee that one of my professors knew to tell me what the workplace was like and how the people are and what to expect from my interviews.  Im gonna stop ranting now lol...maybe go do something fun and come back when im less irritated/sad. Thanks for commenting btw!"
actuary,374kyt,azim40,12,Sun May 24 23:34:57 2015 UTC,Be a normal person. No interviewer wants to hear your canned shit for everything. We want to know if we will enjoy working with you. It sounds like you are too concerned about the interview formalities and not the actual conversation.
actuary,374kyt,zech83,3,Mon May 25 04:26:36 2015 UTC,"Yes to this, have you watched film of yourself? If you're canned material is good and one can't tell it's been said a million times, then it's fine... otherwise you may want to mix it up a bit. I never realized it, but working at a Hollywood video and a Banana Republic for sales really helped. It forced to find a way to quickly find a connection with people outside of what I was trying to sell them. When I got my first consulting job I remember being able to quickly connect during small talk. A working knowledge of fantasy sports, local restaurants, fashion, and other non-work topics let them know late nights and lunch breaks weren't going to be painful. Now I use that skill to connect with clients during breaks as no one wants to talk for four straight hours about how their health plan is going or can be changed."
actuary,374kyt,aspiringactuary4,2,Mon May 25 04:53:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i used to make videos back in high school so i actually got one of my professors to help film and mock interview me. It helped a lot with body language and stuff.  Thats why i like 1 on 1 interviews, to find that connection that you can go on a tangent for away from the actual interview. Usually they relate to something in my ""Interests"" section and we talk about music for a while, which is awesome conversation compared to stupid interview questions.  Thanks for your input!"

He told me other people from his program got jobs at PayPal and NASA. IMO those boot camps are only worth it if you want to change career completely.

If per chance you haven't had an actuarial internship you probably would have been better off trying to find a summer one. It's late for that now, but there are a few winter ones you could apply to while continuing to search full-time. No harm in applying to both.  I would definitely say study for MFE. I'm attempting to study for the July sitting while balancing an internship starting soon. Probably unlikely I'll pass, but in your case you can also add sitting for MFE to your resume. Should be a little boost while you search.   And at least in my mind it should realistically be easier to study while looking for a job then working one even if they give you study hours. I'm curious if people who have had this experience already think it's the case."

I meant I'm curious as to whether current actuaries found it easier to study while looking for a job or while actually working but typically having paid study hours (granted these vary in number and aren't always a thing). I imagine it might also depend on whether it was consulting or not though."

But if you really intend to do it in one month, I think you're gonna need way more than 30 hours. Possibly double that.  (Also, go Binghamton!)"
actuary,370omm,andrew_h83,1 point,Sun May 24 16:08:21 2015 UTC,"It may be possible but you'll likely have to study more than 30 hours a week; I would expect you'd need at least 40 hours a week.  Personally I found that the material on MFE is far more dense than it is for P or FM. If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't try to condense it into a one month period. Considering the time and money you have to commit to the exam, you're almost certainly better off spending the extra time to be confident with the material rather than rushing through it and bearing a large risk of failing."

I skipped stochastic integration and Chapter 26 of ASM (interest rate models), which if I remember right only cost me two questions on the exam. Focus on really understanding Black-Scholes so you can intuitively figure out the formulas for different option types and practice for speed on easy binomial trees and simulation problems, and that should get you most of the way there."

Edit: You need calculus II

actuary,36yggm,PassionVoid,2,Sat May 23 21:03:44 2015 UTC,"Reality check here:  A lot of my friends who are accounts / becoming accountants were only required to take a first year calculus class in order to qualify them for their intermediate accounting courses. For the actuaries at my university, you're required to take calc 1-3, differentials/linear, stats w/ calc, and several other math-related coursework.  That being said, I would highly recommend Khan Academy in order to get your feet wet again. Was a life saver for calc 3 and when we branched into diffeq's.  Other than that, check out The Infinite Actuary and the SOA 240 practice problems. And if you want to purchase a textbook, check out Actex Probability for Risk Management."
actuary,36yggm,nycixc,2,Sat May 23 06:05:33 2015 UTC,"As for b, sort of. You get paid study time off of work, but it's nowhere near enough. For my latest exam, I got 150 hours at work and studied 450 total. For six months straight, I would work a 6-7 hour day and study for 3 hours. That's basically your entire day. I consider myself a pretty smart person (4.0 dual degree with honors in university) and it's still a huge time commitment and I have failed exams. Compared to most, I've gotten through the exams pretty quickly - it took 5 years from my first exam until I got my FSA. During a lot of that time my entire social life is put on hold and I don't see some of my friends for 6 months. If you spread the exams out more obviously you'll have more free time, but at the expense of taking more time to finish."

You'll also have London Life in town so a great opportunity to start your network right away.   As for your degree, I would highly suggest looking into pursuing an actuarial science degree rather than just a general degree. The company I'm interning for this summer hired 17 summer students, each of us  actuarial math majors. Though it's possible to get into a company's agitprop program without it, it definitely puts you in a better position to prepare for exams and get offers.    It's a great career. You agent going to find the type of compensation and benefits in any other career. If you don't believe me, check out DW Simpson's statistics on salaries.  Gotta remember that even when you graduate, you've got years more studying ahead of you. There are 8 very challenging exams and a number of other requirements to become an FCIA/FSA/FCAS, which you NEED to do to continue in the career. If you can handle the math, enjoy problem solving, and like the idea of a desk job it's secondly a great choice for you!"

Hopefully I can find my passion, and follow it through. From what I've heard though, the actuarial field in Canada is not so great at the moment. Do you have any information on that?"
actuary,36y4hc,sooneroo,2,Sat May 23 18:56:25 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen so far and from what I hear from talking with many of the actuaries at my company and my mother who is an actuary of 20 years, the demand for actuaries is higher than ever and growing at that. Though there are also more actuarial students than ever...  Actuaries are in more demand than ever before, and with ERM exploding, the demand for those with a CERA should definitely rise as well. That's my thoughts on the matter based on what I've discussed with many of the actuaries at my company. Also, actuaries are being used in roles far different that just pricing and reserving and other traditional roles. Areas like internal audit, ERM, and even corporate compliance and marketing use actuaries at my life company (yes there are a number of actuaries in marketing at my company). I've been  placed at a financial services sister company for the summer where I am part of the corporate research  department which is almost exclusively actuaries. I've seen so many actuaries used in these  nontraditional roles that I feel quite good about my future employment prospects.  I just started my first internship two weeks ago. I have no exams (writing FM in June) and a 3.6 GPA through two years of university. So by no means did I have exceptional qualifications. That said, my soft skills and technical skills (Excel and VBA) are ahead of the vast majority of other students. You've just got to make yourself better than the competition some how, then you should have no trouble.  This is largely based on my personal experience and I am just a student/intern. So keep that in mind when considering what I have to say."

Be an actuary if you like taking and studying for exams and you like learning about business. I thought actuarial science was a math oriented career with a little bit of business, but turns out it's more business oriented with a little bit of math. Glad I got out before I was in too deep"
actuary,36y4hc,ahnjuhla,1 point,Sat May 23 04:54:10 2015 UTC,How deep were you before you changed your mind? Was there a catalyst?
actuary,36y4hc,mathieforlife,0,Sat May 23 17:20:00 2015 UTC,"I guess not very deep at all. I passed P on my first attempt and got an actuarial internship at a major health insurance company. Worked there for one year, full time during the summer and part time during the school year because my university was right by the office. Got stuck on FM because of how heavily finance oriented it is and I didn't have background in those concepts. Still wish I could've passed it because the mathematical skills needed for the exam are not terribly advanced, and I felt so shitty about myself each time I failed. My manager at my internship also ended up being horrible and somewhat vindictive so my internship ended about a month before I graduated at which point I started looking at jobs in different fields such as data science/software development. I got two job offers and will be starting my new career in about a week.  I guess actuarial science just ended up not being for me or maybe I would've done better under different circumstances, but my general feeling is that if you are looking for a mentally challenging job you could do better than actuarial. The technical skills you need are not standardized as in everyone knows little bits and pieces of different technologies, and you just learn as you go. I guess that's true in most industries but the thing is, there was no attempt at a consistent work style - as long as you get some semblance of what your boss wants (which is not always communicated well) it doesn't matter how shittily put together the project is.   The type of person that I think should go into actuarial is one who really really enjoys learning about business and who is okay with projects not being defined very clearly and not knowing if your results really made any difference. Some people are okay with that so more power to them and the very nice raises they get with each grueling exam that they pass. It just wasn't for me.  Edit: I was a math major (I didn't want to get pigeonholed in actuarial science)"

How much previous experience did you have to the material before starting to study and do you have any recommendations as to what to use to study? Thanks!!"
actuary,36rwqy,twentysacked,1 point,Sat May 30 09:28:32 2015 UTC,This is super encouraging to me as I just hit about 200 hours of study for Exam P. I take the exam on July 18th. I'm using adapt and will be at EL 4.5 within the next week or so. Theres almost no way I will get to EL 7 so I am so happy to read this. Confidence is growing!!!!

My suggestion is that for the next 20 days or so, you take an exam on 1 day, then review the problems you got wrong on the next day, and repeat up until the exam. I took a practice exam the day before the exam, then rested until exam time.  You got this brother!"

actuary,36t26l,steelmania75,10,Thu May 21 22:03:20 2015 UTC,"Being succesful on these exams is all about being honest.  As others of said, I really don't think you were 'just on the edge' of passing, sorry.  An EL of 3.95 isn't good.  What are you doing to improve.  Simply throwing yourself on practice test after practice test isn't going to help if your not taking extra steps to improve your understanding.  Are you going back to your study manual and reviewing sections you consistently miss?  Are you going over the questions you're getting wrong on your practice exams?  Your goal should be 100% mastery.  Spend a day (or two if necessary) going over each question you get wrong with a fine-toothed comb.  Get to the point where you can complete the question correctly with out a formula sheet or solution guide.  A lot of people say the real exam is around a 5.  I tend to agree with this.  So what should your EL be?  A 10.  Here's why:  Everytime you get a certain percent correct on a practice exam (I think it's 66%) your EL increases regardless of where you were and what the test difficulty is.  This means you could get an EL of 10 by just taking level 1 tests and dominating them.  Sure this is a little inaccurate, but it's just how it works.  So my suggestion is to work your way up from an EL of 3 to an EL of 6 by taking exams that match your EL.  Get better by reviewing the problems you get wrong.  If necessary, go back and review your manual.  Once you get to EL of 6, keep taking level 6 exams.  You should be doing well enough that even though you stay on level 6 your EL keeps getting higher.  That being said, make sure you stay sane.  Don't burn out, take a day off if necessary.  Side note:  When i'm taking practice exams if I know I don't know the answer I leave the question blank.  There's no point in guess the correct answer.  Leave it blank and get it wrong so you know to go back and practice it.  Anyway,  I'm glad to here you're planing on taking the exam again.  Good luck!  Feel free to ask for help on any questions you get stuck on."
actuary,36t26l,jebuz23,4,Fri May 22 04:09:22 2015 UTC,Leaving it blank and not guessing is such good advice. I tried to explain that logic to my friends and they didn't get why.
actuary,36t26l,duncanbishop24,1 point,Fri May 22 13:27:12 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna try that!  I think it gives you a chance to see what your real score would be without guessing.  Sure you may get a few right guessing by sheer luck, but most of the time you'll miss them all."

Based on your ADAPT scores, you're probably a bit farther than one or two questions away from passing. They start you at a level 3, so the fact that you didn't get bumped up until your final exam leads me to believe you have some work to do. Just keep doing practice problems, including quizzes in the areas you have trouble with.."
actuary,36t26l,TrueBlonde,6,Thu May 21 23:26:18 2015 UTC,Study more. That's the solution for any exam you fail.
actuary,36t26l,taooverpi,2,Fri May 22 01:11:59 2015 UTC,"There are tolerance ranges associated with the categories, and depending on the distribution of the questions you could have had a mix against you.  That your General Probability is low, is a little telling that you likely have some work to do.    Good luck on your next go, if you keep your momentum going, you'll pass next attempt."
actuary,36t26l,eapocalypse,2,Thu May 21 23:29:13 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be confident going into an exam unless I was at 5+ on Adapt. 6/7 is a pretty safe bet. You need to do a lot more tests and make sure you are studying the tests after you do them until you can do the ones you got wrong easily. You were likely more than 1 or 2 problems away from passing like the others said.
actuary,36t26l,bolzcas,1 point,Fri May 22 03:21:02 2015 UTC,"I scored high in one category and low in two and got a 5, so you probably just missed passing."

It looks all over the place from my point of view.   The only other thing I can comment on is, SQL should take you maybe 1 or 2 days to gain practical knowledge. Then just find on online tutorial that will check your syntax, so you can gain actual experience. Do maybe 10 minutes a day of these tutorials, and you'll be set for SQL."
actuary,36kzzq,99demo,1 point,Wed May 20 05:29:57 2015 UTC,"[Fearful student]  In regards to the minors: Spanish: My parents put me in my first Spanish class when i was four. Ive been passionate about it ever since. When I graduated from high school and saw my academic advisor for the first time, she said ""wow. Lets have you take a placement test for those spanish skills"" and half an hour later she told me that i had gone beyond the bounds of placement s o they would just throw me into the 300 level and that if i accepted that, i could have a minor with only four classes. I agreed and completed my Spanish minor two years ago. I have since then also become a published author in my university's language department academic journal and my minor gpa is a 3.77. Finance: the minor is essentially built in to my major with the exception of one course, Cost Accounting. Im taking that in July, and it should be an easy 4.0. Economics: essentially built in with the exception of one elective course of my choosing. In my sophomore year i found i most enjoy the healthcare part of the actuarial field, and so i will be taking Economics of Healthcare to complete this minor. This class will be in January, in my last semester. I am very very very much looking forward to this class. It is offered only in Januaries of even years, so i quite literally arranged everything around being able to take this course. Mathematics: this minor is built into my major. I believe the requirements are calc 1-3, which ive completed, linear algebra, also completed, and Diff Eq (taking this Fall) Yay for a freebie :) Business Analytics: This is a brand new minor at my university. It wont even show up on my transcript as me pursuing it until this Fall. My R Python Excel Wizard professor created it and i am extremely excited and hopped on this opportunity the very second i saw it. I met with him and he told me based on the various courses i have to take, like Econometrics and Risk Management and whatnot, that he would grant me the minor if i take only two additional courses: R Python and Excel Wizard (not actual name of course lol). So of course i hopped on immediately. I feel both are extremely relevant to the field.  In regards to SQL i didnt know it would be that quick!! Fantastic! Thank you for the info."
actuary,36kzzq,sitsathomeallday,1 point,Wed May 20 13:12:43 2015 UTC,"[actuary here]   The number of minors looks copious but are also largely relevant. When you interview, if you have a decent reason why you picked so many,  you'll be fine. Also don't fail any - if you fail any, for whatever reason, people will assume you 'took on too much' which generally people don't like.   R should be sufficient. Its fine to just demonstrate you know how coding works - learning languages specific for jobs can come later. SQL is useful, though you already have a lot to do, so should be a low priority.   Put down your intentions to sit exams on your cv. Employer won't mind when you passed the exams as long as you did pass them.  Can't speak for gpa, I am UK based.

actuary,36i8lv,Actuarial,3,Tue May 19 16:29:29 2015 UTC,"This is very nice to hear.  Currently as a teacher, I'm very much looking forward to a job of ""Get there, do work until it's time to leave, leave.""  As for 'down time', I've heard from a lot of people that you can fill this down time by studying or looking at other people's projects to see if you can learn something (e.g. open up an excel file and see how they programmed it).  Is this true as well?"
actuary,36i8lv,jebuz23,2,Tue May 19 16:38:33 2015 UTC,"Early on, yes. As you get more and more projects, there's always something you can refine either by automation or detail. This is especially true in larger companies, where work can be diffused more easily when you get overloaded or want to start taking study time. If you're in a consulting job, you are much more likely to be working 50+ hours per week during busy season, but you are also more likely to be billing your time hourly."
actuary,36i8lv,Actuarial,5,Tue May 19 16:44:07 2015 UTC,"In consulting, there's usually opportunities to fill your time just because there's so much to do throughout the year. For example, I had 2 hours of time today, so I looked at timelines for my clients and saw what projects could be moved up, if something could be moved up could an intern do it? If so, I could go about prepping work files for that project, never not busy I guess."
actuary,36i8lv,twittalessrudy,1 point,Tue May 19 21:04:14 2015 UTC,On the point of    of course you're in a salary so you wouldn't benefit from the extra hours   I haven't heard of many companies that do not compensate at all for working more than a standard workweek. My company's end-of-year bonus is a function of hours worked over expectation. I know a couple people with similar programs.
actuary,36i8lv,SwedishLovePump,4,Tue May 19 18:12:31 2015 UTC,"In consulting, all your time is tracked (that's how we know how much to bill to clients, if client teams are profitable, etc).

It's not like I'm there writing ""ok, it took 3 hours to do A, 1 hour to do B, 1.5 hours to do C..."". I just come in, do my shit, and go home at the end of the day. My manager likes me to stay at least for a full day, but I know others in different areas who will come in on a Friday at 10 and leave at 3 and no one cares.

actuary,36ifn0,djacobson726,1 point,Tue May 19 17:56:05 2015 UTC,"I emailed them.  Their response:   Thank you for contacting us. The difficulty level of the exam is figured by Adapt. You don't actually need to be too concerned with it as it appears you are doing just fine and you can continue to take exams and you'll be prepared.   The difficulty level of the exam is an average of the questions it contains. So Adapt is likely pulling in some harder questions. This is actually a good indicator, as once you've exhausted a section it means you're probably well prepared for that type of question.   The actual exams tend to have questions from 3-6 difficulty on Adapt. There is no magical difficulty level of an exam in Adapt. Instead, as you progress in EL, you should see the variety of questions and difficulty that you could potentially see on an exam."

actuary,36f18h,M4r3,10,Mon May 18 21:49:22 2015 UTC,"The nominal interest rate is not a ""real"" interest rate. It's an interest that is multiplied in order to fit a year.    Suppose nominal rate of interest is 10% p.a. paid quarterly.   a) Find the effective annual rate of interest.    10% nominal is the real interest rate of 10%/4 quarterly. That gives us 2.5% effective, quarterly interest. So, we have the ""real"" interest rate, but only for the quarter. If we get interest compounded at this rate every quarter, it is compounded for the year 4 times. (1.025)4 . That gives us about 1.1038, or 10.38% interest.   b) Find the effective rate of interest over 3 months. First of all what means over 3 months?    It is the rate that is effective every quarter (12months/4 = every 3 months). So, yeah, 2.5%."

About your other question, I find it is much better in the long run if you try and understand things intuitively rather than trying to fit things to a formula. I think that the core reading makes things seem more complicated than they really are, and you can easily be confused trying to understand the formulae."
actuary,36f18h,Servaphetic,1 point,Tue May 19 21:36:00 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice! It annoys me a little that the core material explains someting in a certain way and then calculates the examples in a totally different manner that only confuses. I can do the examples in my own way with much more intuitive sense than written in the core reading.
actuary,36f18h,MatchTheOdds,1 point,Tue May 19 16:41:55 2015 UTC,"You've got a great explanation here from FleetingWish. In honesty, I'm not too sure why nominal rates are ever quoted, it would be an awful lot easier if everyone just applied the effective rate (since that is the one which makes the most sense and is actually applied in calculations).   With respect to your other point, I'd advise you to go with intuition if possible and learn to know when to accept things for what they are when necessary. If you have good intuition for a certain section of the module, that's great, if you don't, it's probably not the end of the world. It's probably not time efficient to intuit every single result and attempting to understand everything fully/intuitively might fail you in later modules (CT8 in particular has a huge amount of hand-waving material, due to the avoidance of measure theory).  My main advice would be to do lots of past paper questions so you're not shocked on exam day."

Thanks for the idea ;)
actuary,36brd5,aspiringactuary4,3,Mon May 18 02:35:12 2015 UTC,"I think P&C tends to be more varied, because there are a lot of different P&C lines. The amount of modeling and forecasting you'll be doing (versus fairly rote, easy ratemaking stuff and fairly brain-dead reserving work) is going to depend a lot on:   The size of the entity you work for, The line of business   I've seen P&C lines where pricing is as easy as this: the president of the insurance company decided it would cost $100 and the regulators thought that was a fine price.  Simultaneously, I've seen P&C lines where pricing involves GLMs with over 150 variables. Homeowners coverage can be like that. I've worked on rate filings with greater than 1,000 pages.  In terms of the lines, themselves, health insurance is relatively short tailed compared to a lot of P&C lines. That means that the liabilities are settled much more quickly, so reserving work on the health side is generally easier than, say, professional liability insurance or workers' compensation insurance (on the P&C side), for instance. I've heard it's almost as short as automobile coverage, which tends to be really quick to close. If anyone knows different, I'd be interested. For those on the health side: work comp claims can take 10, 20 years to close. Probably the longest tailed line I've worked is pollution liability. That can take 25+ years for a claim to close.  When that's the case, it's a lot harder to predict how much a claim will wind up costing over time. If things pay out quickly, then by the end of the year, there isn't that much ""unknown"" to predict. Compare that to claims that take 20 years to close. At the end of year 1, there are still 19 years of development to go. There is a lot less known about the claim relative to what you will eventually know about the claim.  I think that there may be a bit more predictive modeling on the health side in general, but that isn't going to be the case all the time (such as in the cases I mentioned above), and I would imagine you're also somewhat restricted in the data you can collect? On the P&C side, it's more about what you can justify collecting. Beyond that, to some extent the sky's the limit.  I think P&C is probably a bigger growth market because there's such a wide (and rapidly growing) variety of P&C products. There are a lot of types of health insurance, sure, but there are WAAAY more types of P&C products. So you're kinda talking apples and oranges here. Within P&C there's so much variation in how much math is involved that you can't really generalize."
actuary,36brd5,M_Bus,1 point,Mon May 18 06:08:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for the long reply! Would you say this generally applies to P&C vs. Life as well? Life will involve more randomness / predictive modeling?
actuary,36brd5,M_Bus,2,Mon May 18 16:36:15 2015 UTC,"Actually no. I think that Life is slightly different. My understanding, and this is fairly limited, is that life has a lot more to do with capital management.  The reason is this: with life insurance, the likelihood of a claim is 100% because people die eventually. And on average, it's actually not difficult to predict the number of people that will die in a given year because life tables haven't changed dramatically in a long time. More to the point, though, with life insurance you know how much a claim will cost in advance. With P&C, if someone gets in a car accident, you don't know in advance if it's a fender bender or if they drove through a storefront and did tens of thousands of dollars in damage. With Life, you agree in advance how much you're going to pay out if someone dies.  Finally, if I buy life insurance at the age 30, you know that I'm probably not going to have a claim for a while. If I have auto insurance, I might have an accident today. So in terms of timeframe, there's a big difference in terms of what kinds of things you can invest in. You wouldn't take my premium dollars from auto insurance and put it in a 30 year bond because you might need that money tomorrow. But you might do that with my life insurance premiums, because you probably won't need money to pay out for a while.  So with life insurance, you are much less concerned with predicting losses and much more concerned with figuring out how best to maximize your investments. So my understanding is that Life (like Pension) is more about maximizing investments. Health is more similar to P&C, in that it's more concerned with losses than it is with investments.  Edit: I get it! Life insurance is more complicated than I painted it out to be. I guess I would edit my response to be this: life insurance has a different relationship to claims than P&C does, and as a result of that relationship, life is going to be generally more focused on capital management and market considerations than P&C. In P&C, actuaries don't do MUCH with capital management OR market considerations. We do a LITTLE, but not a ton."
actuary,36brd5,TrueBlonde,2,Mon May 18 17:00:00 2015 UTC,"with life insurance, the likelihood of a claim is 100% because people die eventually.   Vast oversimplification. People lapse and some products are helped by lapses and some aren't. Life insurance is very tied to the market - how will PHs choose to direct their investments in fixed vs variable? What about taking loans and partial withdrawals? What about using waiver of premium or long term care riders? How much will the claim cost if the PH dies (the DB is basically the face amount minus the AV which is always changing)? How much will hedging cost if the market goes up or down?  You're right that there's a lot of capital management, but you vastly simplified life insurance. It is a lot lot more complicated than just looking at mortality.  Additionally, reserves are a lot bigger of an issue for life."
actuary,36brd5,M_Bus,1 point,Mon May 18 19:13:59 2015 UTC,"Well that's fair. It's just a very different beast than what I'm used to dealing with, because the uncertainty around claims is not quite the same. E.g., in P&C, a policyholder can have one or multiple claims at any time in the policy period (or beyond, depending on the coverage), so we're much more concerned with that. The severity of claims is only very obliquely affected by market considerations, so capital and markets don't get nearly the same focus.  I mean, obviously if it were as easy as looking up someone on a life table and waiting, there wouldn't be a ton of exams. Didn't mean to tread on anyone's toes. I admit to being pretty ignorant about life insurance. But it does sound like I was at least right about one thing: it's pretty different from P&C."
actuary,36brd5,PassionVoid,2,Mon May 18 21:16:07 2015 UTC,the likelihood of a claim is 100% because people die eventually   This is flat-out false.
actuary,36brd5,M_Bus,1 point,Tue May 19 03:39:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're not the first person to point it out to me.  If a policyholder stays with you and doesn't alter their policy, it's true that everyone dies eventually.  It would have been better for me to state that the role of claims is somewhat different than in P&C, where a single individual can have multiple claims over multiple years, and those claims have severity that is only minimally correlated with the market under most conditions.  Instead, I gave a WAY oversimplified view of life insurance, but in fairness to myself, I did point out that I was ignorant in the first sentence of the post."
actuary,36brd5,azim40,1 point,Tue May 19 04:20:09 2015 UTC,"Huh. That sounds kind of boring to me, so maybe P&C should be my route. Although, everyone wants to do P&C it seems, and the exam process is harder..  So it sounds like Life would have minimal predictive modeling."
actuary,36brd5,M_Bus,2,Mon May 18 17:04:38 2015 UTC,"If we did minimal predictive modeling, I would be out of a job."
actuary,36brd5,TrueBlonde,1 point,Tue May 19 19:31:25 2015 UTC,"I think that's right, yeah.  I think P&C has been experiencing some rapid growth recently, yeah. I don't know what the job market is like for entry-level actuaries right now, but I suspect it's a little tight. But I think that it may have a lot of opportunities that you won't find as much in the life/health side, and I think the work is probably more varied and interesting, depending on what you want to do.  The exams aren't easy, but if you're already interested in predictive modeling, you probably won't hate them AS much. Exams 7 through 9 have a fair bit of predictive modeling stuff on them. I recall Exam 7 had at least one paper on GLMs, a couple on various claims models... I think Exam 9 had a paper on K-Nearest Neighbors cluster analysis... so if you view those exams as more along the lines of ""this is something I would be studying anyway as background"" then you'll probably have an easier time of it.  I BELIEVE that it takes an average of 7 years to pass all the exams, but that's an average. I failed quite a few (I was in an MBA program for two years in the middle and didn't spend as much time studying as I should have) and I still managed to finish in 6.  Anyway, if you have time, I would recommend trying to land an internship or two. Maybe then you can get the flavor of the different sides for yourself and see what you want to do.  Also, most of the ""entry-level exams"" (i.e., through exam 4/C) are applicable for both SOA and CAS, so you don't have to decide right away.  If you DO go casualty, go to the CAS. I don't think most casualty consultancies or casualty insurers take the SOA ""General Insurance"" track very seriously. I think the CAS is the way you need to go if you want a job in casualty."

actuary,36brd5,TrueBlonde,1 point,Mon May 18 19:24:54 2015 UTC,"There are lots of applications for predictive modeling in life. For example, if you have a variable annuity, what do lapse rates look like under different market conditions? How does that change if you add in guarantees? How do you create a model that accounts for dynamic lapsation? For life products, predictive modeling is huge for figuring out renewal premiums on a seriatim basis. If someone has paid $300 a year for the last 20 years it's pretty easy. But what if their payments look like  10,000 0 0 30,000 0 100 0 0 1,000 10,000 0   What do you predict they'll pay for this year? You need to know in order to manage capital and set up reserves. There's a huge difference between them paying $0 and $30,000. So what do you do?  Underwriting is another big area for PM. It takes about 30 days from when a policy is applied for until all underwriting is complete. You have to get blood tests, medical tests, the works. Not fun, right? PM is working on figuring out good risks based on credit scores, BMI, height and weight, auto accidents, job, etc - all sorts of data. Then, you can get an underwriting decision INSTANTLY with absolutely no need for any bloodwork. But... which variables do you look at to figure out who you can insure risk free vs who isn't a good risk?  There's a lot more, but those are just some examples. There's a lot of really cool stuff being done."

actuary,36brd5,secret_word,1 point,Mon May 18 21:32:52 2015 UTC,"These would be things you would learn along the way.  Essentially, lapse rates vary based on a number of factors, one of which is the interest rate environment.  For instance, policy holders with a guaranteed return higher than what they could earn in the market will very likely hang on to those policies.  Our stochastic models predict lapses based on different potential interest rate environments.  The differing premiums are something that would be seen on an FPA product.  Essentially, the policyholder can pay whatever they want, whenever they want.  Obviously, this makes modeling cash flows and investments quite challenging."
actuary,36brd5,Meztez,1 point,Tue May 19 19:40:40 2015 UTC,"P&C and health use a lot of similar concepts. Mathematically, health is closer to P&C since you use shorter term projections and have shorter claim lengths. Actuarially, it's closer to life insurance, since you're focused on mortality and morbidity. IMO it's easier to transition between P&C and health (job wise) than it is life to health. It's weird that health is under the SOA - I think it would fit better under the CAS."
actuary,36brd5,Meztez,1 point,Mon May 18 12:16:32 2015 UTC,"I work in life/health.  When I was just starting out, I ended up reading books intended for P/C to learn about reserving and managing health business.  Unlike typical life insurance, it's very short term - premium comes in and then goes out quickly as claim dollars.  At the time (not sure if it's changed now), there wasn't a lot of literature meant solely for health business.  We do use predictive modelling and due to my firm's smaller size, this is the only life line of business we use it on."

You really should be either all in a target retirement fund or not in one at all. The target retirement funds are just a mix of stocks and bonds, so you should either allocate 100% to that or invest in index funds in the same proportion."

When things like this happen, it's not so much the fault of any one individual, but rather the fault of the organizational structure that failed to put in appropriate controls. This really sounds like a control failure if it could have been prevented by tying to a different, credible source of data that was known in advance.   The responsibility for controls falls on actuarial management and any other ""peers"" in the loop of the control process.   Bottom line: it is a system failure, not an individual failure. Any company that implicitly bets on individual infallibility is taking a highly unnecessary risk."

You have already realized your error and spent your weekend determining how to prevent something like this from ever happening again.

It doesn't matter how many times someone has done something or how comfortable they are with the concepts. Mistakes happen. If anyone is on the hook for this, it is your boss. He is the one who needs to justify why he felt that this important task was not worthy of his review. I've been in the field for years and I still get peer review on everything I do, whether this means getting the more junior guys to double check my technical work or getting a more senior colleague to check the judgment stuff.  Honestly, while I understand how you are probably very worried about this, from an outsider's perspective it doesn't sound as serious as you think. No policyholders lost their savings, no one lost their job. Some capital was allocated sub-optimally. It will be corrected going forward, and there are no real consequences from the sound of it."

I also struggle to think you're even going to be in a ton of trouble.  If I were your leader I would actually apologize to you directly for leaving you on an island and would own the screw up as a break down in the peer review process and my own ability to manage work flow in a way that ensures checks and balances are in place.  The only thing that you can use this as is a learning experience.  ASOP 23 has a whole section regarding reliance on data provided by others.  Technically speaking, you are not required to audit the data, you are however required to test the data for reasonableness and ensure it aligns with you professional judgment.

actuary,365tcl,99demo,3,Sat May 16 22:44:55 2015 UTC,"A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT  OP, my advice is that you should consider that many others have gone through this before, AND SURVIVED.  Sure, their screw ups may not have been exactly comparable, but the feelings of shame or guilt were still as strong.     Just remember, OP, that what you are experiencing could have been something much worse; i.e., take a look at the defecation-storm and world wide humiliation campaign that Monica Lewinksy went through!!  She probably couldn't ""eat, sleep..."" or probably ever enjoy her life, FOR YEARS. Having her name branded along with the word ""slut,"" ""disgrace,"" ""whore,"" ""un-american,"" and ""terrorist;"" for ever. Never mind all of the other endless negative media attached to that unfortunate soul.  Or, similarly, at least you're not being beat up constantly, as some teenagers have to unfortunately go through, at school; for their mistakes or lifestyles. And, as you may well know, OP, these teens don't always survive this torment.    So, my advice to you is, if all of these other people were able to make it through their crucibles of shame, there's no reason why you can't.   And, out of the 80+ years of your life time, this little smidgen of shame you're going through will only haunt you for around 2 weeks at the most, I'm sure.  In all, being an actuary, you have to admit that 2 weeks is pretty insignificant, in comparison to 80 years!   Cheers, and best of luck."

From what I've been reading, actuaries must be gods of checking their work well. You mentioned another project, did you make a mistake there as well?  Don't worry too much about it.  What happened as a result of your mistake? Depending on the severity of the effect, your coworkers will forget about it after a while. And if you switch to a different company, you'll most likely start with a clean slate. The business cycle goes too fast for people to be able to care about something that happened a while ago.  Don't be afraid to get your work checked. Actually, that was a standard where I worked (again, different field). Even the VP of my department would send out parts of a report to be spot-checked.  Check your work, and ask a colleague to also look over it quickly. Show your supervisors that you learned from your mistake by not letting a big mistake happen again. Small ones that you can correct can be fine, and as long as you have a system in place to check, you'll be fine."

Just keep yourself to a really disciplined schedule: I'd suggest every other day practice tests.  So Day 1: 2 practice tests, 2-3 quizzes in Adapt, Day 2: Hardcore review/memorizing whatever you got wrong/necessary formulas and then repeat.  Until you find that you're not really needing a whole day for review and memorizing, in which case you should JUST be testing every day.  You don't really have enough time to be going through the manual in a traditional manner, you need to be doing practice problems right now.  Good luck!!"

actuary,35zut3,Kamuii,4,Tue Jun 2 00:39:37 2015 UTC,"People on here who know me from the AO probably know who I am here, so I don't mind giving these details out.  I was an actuarial science major for 3.5 years and switched in my last semester to mathematics (statistics emphasis). Worked in actuarial education independently for a year, did it for 2 months full-time, did actuarial education + full-time actuarial analyst job for about 9 months, and I'm moving on to a healthcare technology position while doing a M.S. statistics degree from a top-20 school (and doing actuarial education when I have time). I have 4 exams currently and am waiting on (hopefully) a pass on MLC.  Let me just say that I am 100% glad that I switched to the math degree in the last semester. I had interviews during these last two weeks which only considered me because of my mathematical statistics degree, and there is no way that an actuarial degree would have put me in consideration nor would it have prepared me for the interviews.   Really, most of the crap I had to deal with in this field was getting into the first job. I spent at least 3 years searching for internships and FT positions (2 years internships, 1 year FT positions) and came up empty on the internships. I only have the FT position I do now because I was in the area, and I guess, I seemed competitive because of my statistics degree (I can't think of any other reason for it happening).  After working for 9 months in my current position, I thought to myself, do I really want to do what the FSAs here are doing and do what I'm doing for at least another 2-3 years? Do I want to miss out on doing graduate-level work and becoming a statistician? Obviously, the answer was no for both of those, and I am hopeful that I will be able to pave an alternate path for myself. Plus I needed to live closer to home (6 hours away).  Pre-ASA is the time to move around, I've read. Trying to move after is more difficult."

The stroke of the pen risk with respect to the politics and political pressures are almost unreal.  First, it was transitional policy relief and extending pre-ACA rates and policies for nearly 3 full years, which was suddenly thrust on us in November of 2013.  Pricing assumptions - out the window.  System preparation you've been doing for 3 years - out the window.  Processes you expected to have in place - out the window.  So, effectively you had a situation whereby the government bends to political pressures without apparently really considering the impacts to the industry.  Now you have King vs. Burwell, while we've just sent all our 2016 rate filings out the door.  If the Supreme Court does not rule in favor of maintaining the subsidies - all your pricing assumptions are again out the window.  It isn't clear whether or not states will allow you to refile or make you wait until next year.  And in a year and a half we'll have a new President and no one knows what new challenges that might put in place with the ACA.  We could be unraveling all of this work yet again, and going in a brand new direction.  We really have a situation where it seems like each year when we file rates we can't know what new interpretation or adjustment to the law that is completely unexpected is not being accounted for.    While some carriers may have written a good deal of new business, a lot of that business was written at a loss.  A portion of that is due to transitional policy relief, a portion of that is due to experience just deviating from expectations, and going forward you have to think there are economies of scale which are going to tend toward dominance by a single carrier in each market.  Prior to the ACA, if you weren't the dominant player and couldn't negotiate the best deals, at least you could compete on risk selection and underwriting.  But now we can't even get there, so the big player is going to negotiate better deals with their overwhelming market share, leading to better rates, leading to better deals etc.   Anyway, that's my .02.

Personally I don't find those strong enough recommendations to pick Act Sci as your major, but that's just me. As a member of the recruiting committee for my company, I don't often find that non-act sci majors are barred from attending recruiting events like job fairs or one-off presentations that I may give at a university, so the networking is often available to other majors if you just have some initiative and put yourself out there. And regarding exam prep - definitely can't beat getting college credit for studying for exams, but at some point you're going to have to study on your own time. If not on the preliminary exams, then on the upper levels. If I see a candidate who has a math or econ major, for example, and has still managed to pass exams in college, then that is a stronger candidate than an act sci major who has passed the same exams, all other factors being equal. If act sci is your major, then there's an expectation that you have a certain number of exams under your belt, and if you don't, then it raises a big red flag. I'll wonder how you'll manage to get through the rest of the exam process once you're on the job, when you couldn't pass them when passing exams was your job.   Anyway, that's just one man's opinion. We hire a bunch of act sci majors, and a bunch of non-act sci majors. They all do pretty well. Study what interests you, and pass exams in whatever manner works best for you. Cheers!"

actuary,35y8uz,colonelsmoothie,1 point,Thu May 14 15:39:41 2015 UTC,"That's not entirely true, depending on the program. I would guess that most would require you to at least finish some core math classes like linear algebra, discrete math, and maybe real analysis. So you do learn something. However, actuarial classes eat up a lot of the time you could have spent in upper-level math classes that could help land you into good graduate programs."

That's a terrible comparison. Let's have a good candidate and give him an AS major and compare that to a bad candidate and give him a different major. From that comparison, you concluded that AS should be the way to go. But by saying that, you're implying that to pass four exams upon graduation, you need to be AS. That's definitely not always the case as there are undoubtedly good candidates in majors apart from AS.  E: To clarify my argument, you weren't comparing majors, but rather good candidates versus bad candidates, which is pointless."
actuary,35y8uz,doc89,2,Thu May 14 17:45:16 2015 UTC,"I think most people agree that actuarial science coursework is generally easier than general math coursework.  If that is the case, we would expect a candidate majoring in actuarial science to have a higher GPA than they would have had the same candidate majored in Math.  Would you disagree with this?  Further, I think most people would agree that majoring in actuarial science makes it easier to pass exams than majoring in math.  If this is the case, we would expect a candidate majoring in actuarial science to have more exams passed than if the same candidate majored in math.  Would you disagree with this?  This is based mostly on my own experience; I strongly believe if I had majored in math I would have had a significantly worse GPA and fewer exams passed by the start of my senior year (when most people will begin looking for full time jobs) than I did majoring in actuarial science.  I think this would have made me a significantly less competitive candidate.  I now work for a major insurance carrier.  I'm involved in recruiting and have sat in on many discussions regarding hiring (both interns and full time) and never once have I heard someone say ""...yeah, but he was an actuarial science major.  We need someone who really knows number theory for this role.""  Securing interviews is all about exams and GPA.  Securing jobs is all about nailing the interview."
actuary,35y8uz,sooneroo,1 point,Thu May 14 18:24:02 2015 UTC,"I somewhat disagree your first statement since harder majors should attract more diligent students and should not result in a large discrepancy of GPA compared to other majors (by large, I mean 3.7 to 3.2 in your other post). Also, the fact that GPA's of AS majors highly correlate with their exam success fudges the matter even more.  I do agree with your second point that AS majors will have an easier time tackling exams, but you may have some confirmation bias toward AS majors. Just because you're majoring in AS, it does not mean that you are guaranteed exam success and if you major in anything else, you are not guaranteed exams success as you implied in your original post. There are definitely some bad candidates coming from AS majors (and from what I understand, these are also the ones who complain about the poor EL market since they're not qualified enough for actuarial positions, and they can't land jobs elsewhere due to their degree).  Finally, exams is not the only measuring stick. I believe that other majors (particularly math) develop sharper analytical skills and perhaps more diligence than AS due to the difficulty of their coursework combined with studying for exams.  Whatever the case, we'll just have to agree to disagree and leave it at that."

I don't believe in ""guarantees"".  I believe in bell curves.  The probability of passing X or more exams as an AS major is significantly higher than the probability of passing X or more exams as a math major for most people.   Finally, exams is not the only measuring stick. I believe that other majors (particularly math) develop sharper analytical skills and perhaps more diligence than AS due to the difficulty of their coursework combined with studying for exams.   None of this matters for landing a job.  And every study I have seen on the matter shows all students regardless of major retain virtually nothing from their coursework.  Picking a math major because you believe it will ""sharpen your analytic skills"" seems extremely silly to me."

I'm basically taking the classes that the econ majors take, plus courses that will help me pass exams. So if your school's actuarial science major gives you a good mix of econ, statistics, and a couple computer science classes I would say go for it. If you want to go with an econ, stats, or computer science major (or some mix of them) that'll work too.   Honestly, the only major I would not go with would be straight up math. You're just going to be stuck taking a bunch of theoretical math courses where there's a huge emphasis on proofs. But that's just my school, so again, it's something you're going to have to look at based on your school's major requirements."

Why would you back yourself into a corner? Go with a Math, or Econ degree.  Even if your school has an amazing actuarial department, chances are you can still take their classes without majoring in it.  HR people might pick you, thinking you're more qualified as a actuarial science major, but that's about it. And it's all speculation on my part. But when you get to the hiring manager, they will not care.  Just do a math or econ degree, whatever it is, and make sure to get internship experience."

I believe the original question conveys the correct message (I knew exactly what they meant when I read it), so if your not receiving that message, try to find ways of understanding what the author intended with out seeing the solution.  I completely see where you're coming from on your confusion, but I think with enough practice you'll 'get' how they word some questions.  As another user pointed out, don't over assume.

I can only hope that passing my next exam in July will be enough to put me in the top tier of candidates. It's a rough path to go down.  I'd recommend finding a career path that is closer to where you are right now."
actuary,35md03,TrueBlonde,4,Mon May 11 18:32:54 2015 UTC,"I would guess that's more to due with only having one exam, not because you're changing careers. You generally need two to be considered and three or more to stand out."

That's a bummer, I'm sorry to hear you haven't had any hits yet - I hope you have better luck as time goes on. Best of luck on the July exam, hope that does the trick.  As far as the internship - is there any opportunity for people in our situation to land one? I haven't looked into the possibility yet because it seems like it would be nearly impossible to do that with a full-time faculty position. But if not having an internship is a dealbreaker right now..."
actuary,35md03,getonmyhype,1 point,Mon May 11 18:43:29 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, all internships go to students. I get the impression that related work experience and demonstrable skill with relevant software is roughly equal to firms that don't offer internships at all. Firms that do offer internships hire from their intern pool first.  If you're going for a biostat MS, you should prbably find work doing biostats."

As I say in my cover letters, I've reached a ceiling in terms of professional challenges and opportunities for advancement. More informally, teaching is doing the same thing over and over each year and no teachers in my state have received a raise in about 8 years which nobody told me this coming into the job.  My personal satisfaction from the job has been waning as well. I have never stopped taking it personally when students fail, and there are always students that fail. My professional output relies on the work habits of teenagers, which is rarely satisfying. There are times I feel like most of what I do is being ignored by teenagers. The reality of teaching makes you lower your expectations of people and I'm tired of that.  I'm smart, disciplined, and driven enough to do something more productive with my time with better compensation and I'm ready to move forward. As an actuary, the testing process would put me more in control of my professional destiny, I would be able to apply my math skills and knowledge to real challenges, and I would be working with motivated people to make actual accomplishments.

actuary,35lxy2,SirIssacMath,1 point,Mon May 11 18:34:38 2015 UTC,The reason the min thing comes up is because if you do the integral with respect to x (dx) the area will split into 2 different lines. That's why it's better to use the joint here and do dydx directly.

actuary,35ik52,Hutch3232,0,Sun May 10 18:49:13 2015 UTC,"Whether you agree with the politics of social security or not (I personally do not believe it is morally right for a society to have to pay for something individuals should be responsible enough to save for themselves.) It is an undeniable fact that the life expectancy when Social security started in 1935 was ~61 and today it is ~78 in the US. A shift in the distribution of life expectancy of that magnitude is obviously going to continue to be incredibly costly since the age is 65 I believe. Furthermore, I believe it is disingenuous to call it a 'public retirement fund' when it is merely those receiving benefits get a transfer of money from those who pay taxes. But that is neither here nor there. Conversely, I imagine millions of people now depend on that check for better or worse. It would be better if we could just magically get people to start saving for their own retirement as if SS isnt there, but that is difficult to do as well. Additionally as the article mentioned, it doesnt help that the people who are the most consistent voters isnt people my age who recognize the obvious structural problem of the age difference vis a vis when SS started. The people who vote most consistently are senior citzens. I dont think this comes down to a flaw in SS (although as I stated I am oppossed to it existing in the first place.) If tomorrow you moved the age back up to where it was when SS started, ie ~74 I think it would no longer be an issue.  But who is going to vote for that, absolutely no one of course. IMO this problem isnt mutually exclusive to SS just a general flaw if you ask someone to vote on whether they should keep getting a check or not, 100% of the time they are going to vote to keep the check. Im not saying just senior citizens are the problem I am sure if my generation was the most consistent voting block it would be underfunded liabilities for free college or whatever. The theme of the problem is that if you have someones vote determine whether they get checks (reguardless of whether they paid in or not) they are going to vote to keep the checks rolling. IMO thats why I favor constitutional republics over democracies, but thats again off topic. tl;dr: SS has a structural problem due to shifting of age demographics that did not adapt since the program began in 1935. Attempting to solve such a complex problem in such a confined place  is not the best way to go about it because their is no right solution regaurdless of the politics."
actuary,35ik52,Ryan_Rigato,1 point,Mon May 11 03:20:42 2015 UTC,"i really enjoyed reading this, thanks for your thorough response.  may i ask why you favor a constitutional republic?"
actuary,35ik52,Blayzovich,2,Wed Jun 3 12:40:15 2015 UTC,"Well its not that a constitutional republic is perfect, it is just the best option of all the bad choices (to paraphrase Churchill's thoughts on democracy). The fundamental flaw in democracy is that there are no minority protections. And I don't mean minority in the new sense of the word (i.e. someones race). I mean it in the traditional sense of whoever loses the election. Democracy sounds great when you can have catchphrases like 1 vote 1 person (yay we are all equal !). But what happens at a fundamental level in democracy: when 51% of the population decides they want to steal from the other 49%, its all good because it was through democracy. The idea behind a constituational republic is crucial to me because we need minority protections. I think the hardest portion for people to swallow, is that even if it is people that 90% of americans think are bad they still deserve the same protections as everyone else (i.e. the racists/homophobes/etc.) The reason this is crucial because who could possibly decide what is good and what is bad. As long as you do not infringe upon the rights of others. Another counter arguement people make is something along the lines of 'the founding fathers believed in a republic and they owned slaves therefore a republic is morally wrong.' First off thats a red herring arguement and has nothing to do with the ideas behind having a government that has enumerated powers. But on a more fundamental level I would argue that  a constituational republic deals with the dilemma of slavery quite well, after all slaves are people and they deserve the same unalienable rights as anyone else, it is just that their rights were not being protected. Furthermore, how would a democracy have been any better. I am sure for the majority of those years, giving up free labor for nothing would of never passed a ballot proposition.  And this is exactly what happened as many southern states  voted to restrict the rights that should have been guarunteed. One final thought on this, maybe democracy would be better if every voter was properly informed, but I have taken quite a few political science courses and trust me you really aren't more intelligent about how our government was formed as a  result of taking polysci 101. Now don't get me wrong I don't think it is one big conspiracy or something, it is just much easier to do one liners like 'those who believe in a constitutional republic want to kill social securtiy, so basically they want to kill your grandparents.' The problem is that old people are the most reliable voting demo and will be easily persuaded by the threat of someone 'taking what they earned' when in reality SS is just a monetary transfer from young to old. If people would be more informed they would realize that money is being transferred from the least wealthy statistically (young people trying to get their start in the world) to those who should have accumalted a lifetime of wealth (senior citizens). Now conversely I see the problem with just yanking SS away because old people did epxect that money to be their for their retirement and it isnt entirely their fault, I mean it is difficult to blame them for being naive about it not being a retirement fund and really just wealth transfer at best and theft at worst. But these kind of in depth discussions we are having right now dont fit on a bumper sticker. I mean just today I saw a bumper sticker that said 'save Socical securit, vote democrat' when that couldnt be farther from the truth. The issue is way more nuanced than can ever be put on a bumper sticker, once again a constitutional republic wouldnt solve all the problems it is merely slightly better than the worse options, but I mean we need to use the best form of government we can. And I mean anyone who has ever watched a presidential debate knows that the only other thing that is guarunteed in life other than death and taxes is republicans and democrats pandering to old people over who loves SS more, because old people are the most reliable voting block. Dont even get me started on debates, because no one watches them and then they just turn into soundbits, and people pretend like they know a candidate because they heard a 30 second take that was probably taken out of context. Again, nuance. Anyway sorry for getting off topic, I just try to do the best I can to accurately portray both sides of an arguement because I absolutely  disdain what discussion about politics has sunk towards the lowest common denomenator."

When they say they take a cut of your salary, the company pays an additional fee - equivalent to a %age of your salary - to the Recruiter. You pay nothing.   The reason for recruiters is that actuaries are still difficult to find. More specifically, actuaries with the right experience are hard to find. Graduate roles and internships are competitive because many many people fit the profile for them - no experience,  a couple of exams etc.   Need a pricing actuary who has worked for ten years in GI to lead a new team you are creating? Different ball game. The good ones probably aren't looking for a job. They need a Recruiter to call them and say 'hey there's this great job you'd be a good match for' to get the ball rolling.   This is why Recruiters typically don't work with graduates. They help companies fill niche roles, whether that's niche because of the experience required, or sometimes because of the location (eg they need someone who's willing to move to bermuda)"

If you really believe you deserve more because you bring something extra to the table (amazing programming skills or a great background) then it might be worth it to ask for more.

actuary,35b3dm,life_contingencies,2,Fri May 8 16:56:20 2015 UTC,I used the FM videos but I'm assuming the P ones are similar. They were essentially a replacement for the manual. I used the video lessons + adapt exclusively for my exam and passed pretty comfortably.
actuary,35b3dm,justadownswing,2,Fri May 8 17:22:16 2015 UTC,Seconding this for FM but this does not apply to the MFE videos in my opinion. I think TIA + a manual is better.

actuary,358g7z,joshforgets,2,Thu May 7 23:49:08 2015 UTC,"I would not say it is bad, but leave them off.  They might ask you during your interview if they want to know"
actuary,358g7z,dougan037,1 point,Thu May 7 23:51:29 2015 UTC,"That's fair. I've seen other people's resumes on here and never came across one mentioning their scores but I wasn't sure why. Giving them a question to ask is good enough reason for me, thanks!"
actuary,358g7z,Goldburst,2,Fri May 8 00:09:17 2015 UTC,"One of my professors (who was a chief actuary at some company in the past) once said, ""I don't care if you get the highest 10 or the lowest 6, they're both passing scores.""  From what he said, to what I've heard from many others (including on this thread), I think leaving scores off the resume would be safe, and won't be a vital factor when deciding whether to give you an offer during/after the final interview round."
actuary,358g7z,jebuz23,2,Sat May 9 02:30:27 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth I got a 10 on P and a 9 on FM and left them off my resume. I mention them in my cover letter, so there's a chance for them to be brought up. During the interview they wanted to know more about how I study for them and if I needed to retake them than what my scores were."
actuary,358g7z,colonelsmoothie,2,Fri May 8 02:33:58 2015 UTC,"OP: as you can see here, there's not really a general consensus here. Getting all 10s and passing your prelims quickly is definitely an indicator of intelligence. Some hiring managers will look on something like that positively whereas some other hiring managers will be insecure. Imo you don't want to work for a manager who thinks getting a 10 means you overstudied. Getting a 10 and passing is better than studying for a 6 and failing and having to take it again.  FWIW I leave my scores off since I'm an experienced candidate and it takes up too much space. No one really cares about your scores after you've been working in the field for a few years."
actuary,358g7z,zech83,-1,Fri May 8 16:18:42 2015 UTC,"Ha, I don't think it is an issue of insecurity in the slightest! If someone scores all 10s they have poorly allocated their time. The ability to balance thoroughness and efficiency is an incredible skill-set that a string of tens demonstrates you simply don't have or have yet to learn. I want incredibly gifted candidates who understand the balance."
actuary,358g7z,PassionVoid,4,Fri May 8 18:42:42 2015 UTC,There is no way to know how much studying is needed in order to get exactly a 6 until you actually take the exam. Getting a 6 means you were lucky enough that you knew your particular set of questions well enough to avoid a 5. There is no skill involved in getting exactly a 6.
actuary,358g7z,colonelsmoothie,1 point,Sat May 9 01:22:58 2015 UTC,Too many people study for an 8 and then end up getting a 5. It's better to shoot for a 10 and end up getting an 8 (or better yet a 10) than it is to have to retake an exam. And maybe someone who studied 100 hours and got a 10 is a better candidate than someone who studied 600 hours and got a 6. Your logic doesn't demonstrate that someone with a string of 6s has good time management.
actuary,358g7z,zech83,1 point,Fri May 8 22:36:39 2015 UTC,Getting a 10 is different than getting a string of 10s. If someone gets a 10 or two and a 7 and an 8 I would think they're very promising. If someone gets some combination on their first four exams of 9s and 10s I'll think they should reevaluate how they allot their time.
actuary,358g7z,zech83,1 point,Sat May 9 19:49:41 2015 UTC,"If someone studies 100 hours and gets 10s that great, but I don't think the norm for people getting 10s. In my experience, people who constantly get 9s and 10s have major deficiencies in other parts of their life. I disagree with the shoot for a 6 mantra I have heard from some people. I believe a 7 or an 8 to be ideal, and that after taking a few exams one can distinguish the difference between having a slight, a working, and a complete understanding of the material."
actuary,358g7z,dinapolice,3,Sat May 9 20:24:35 2015 UTC,"I review resumes for my organization and I really like to see exam scores on the resume. I get excited about high scores. What I found is that people that get 9 or 10 are generally talented and didn't put in too many hours to get their scores. I also like to see when a candidate notes that they passed on first sitting.  If a candidate does not include their scores, but passes the resume screen, we do ask for the entire exam transcript (passes, fails, scores)."
actuary,358g7z,dinapolice,1 point,Fri May 8 21:28:26 2015 UTC,See I would have never thought of mentioning that to put that I passed it on my first attempt. My guess is that that's something in the cover letter?
actuary,358g7z,zech83,3,Fri May 8 23:47:44 2015 UTC,Cover letter or in your resume. We consider passing on first attempt to be a very good thing.
actuary,358g7z,dinapolice,1 point,Thu May 14 17:11:56 2015 UTC,"Wow, I've never been asked for my transcript. It always comes up in interviews, an one needs to be comfortable talking about what they learned from failing if they have."
actuary,358g7z,zech83,2,Sat May 9 20:15:02 2015 UTC,"It's the way of the future, now that the market is becoming flooded with candidates with multiple exams. We needed a way to differentiate star candidates quickly."
actuary,358g7z,colonelsmoothie,-6,Thu May 14 17:13:04 2015 UTC,"I would judge you poorly for putting them on your resume. If you got a 10 I will think you don't manage your time effectively as you've over studied and should have hobbies, friends, and organizations that you should be spending more time with. Less so if it's P or FM as those are easier and a candidate may not know if they are overstudying, but the last three preliminary exams for sure. Furthermore, I wouldn't more pass all your prelims in college. No one really wants to pay anyone with no experience the amount that people expect to receive with 5 prelims. Also, I was in consulting for a few years to start my career so a failed exam isn't a red flag when I interview candidates. It's something most actuaries will have to face at some point. Hope this helps, and best of luck."
actuary,358g7z,zech83,3,Fri May 8 06:04:31 2015 UTC,"Pass as many exams as you can during college. Ain't nobody got time to study after work. The sooner you're done with all the exams, the better."

actuary,358g7z,zech83,2,Sat May 9 20:17:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  For what it's worth, I'd agree with your original comment if it weren't for the fact that the entry-level job market is so competitive. It'd be great to be able to pass 2 exams in college and put off the rest until you're paid for your study time. But there are probably enough 4+ exam candidates to fill every entry-level opening, and I'm sure a lot of them would work for 1-exam money, so it's tough to take your time on the exams and still be competitive."
actuary,358g7z,PassionVoid,2,Sat May 9 20:35:33 2015 UTC,"I can see that; there are resumes I review now that blow my original resume out of the water. I'd say ideal to ensure one gets hired anymore is to get 4 passed, high GPA, 2 internships, a leadership position in a club or organization and multiple years of volunteerism with the same organization."
actuary,358g7z,zech83,1 point,Sat May 9 20:55:19 2015 UTC,How well were you managing your time when it took you three straight sittings to eventually pass MFE with an 8?
actuary,358g7z,PassionVoid,1 point,Sat May 9 01:24:44 2015 UTC,"I wasn't; there was an arbitrage opportunity at work where I was able to work overtime at time and a half at my consulting firm that I took advantage. My starting salary was about $65,000 but when working 50-70 hours a week due to healthcare reform and short staffing I was pulling in well over $100,000 for three years right out of college. Leveraged what would be equate to over 5 years into a position on a internal consulting health economics team for a major health insurance company where I work directly with several vice presidents, attend client meetings as the lead financial resource, write value story press releases, and design many of our pre and post sale analytic tools. I know that I am behind on my exams compared to my experience. I know this because I am in a position, and at a salary, in an actuarial program that is higher than is ""allowed"" given I am not an ASA yet. I am not suggesting this is the ideal route, but it was successful for me. Regardless, there are a lot of quirks I've seen people rip into resumes about and adding ones score is just another oddity, regardless of score, that could separate a candidate in a poor way."
actuary,358g7z,zech83,0,Sat May 9 20:11:47 2015 UTC,"Sure, adding scores is pointless, but I don't think getting higher than a 6 should be held against someone, and anyone who would hold it against them isn't worth working for. What if I learned everything for P in college, studied hard to pass my final, never studied for the SOA exam itself, and scored a 10? Does that mean I'm bad at managing my time? I think studying to get a 10 and getting a 10 is better time management than studying to get a 6, getting an unlucky draw of questions and getting a 5, and having to retake it."
actuary,358g7z,PassionVoid,1 point,Sat May 9 21:00:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed, don't study for a 6. Agreed, getting a 10 is better than a 5, but getting an 8 and saving 200 hours of ones life is better than getting a 10 for most people and I would like to work with people that understand how to be efficient with their time. To fully caveat as you clearly love your hypotheticals, maybe you're a murderer and and it's better if you were to study that extra 200 rather than killing people, maybe you love studying and that provides the maximum utility for your time. Regardless, I believe whatever scores one has earned, adding them is not just pointless, but possibly detrimental and being efficient is something I value and feel is valued in the workplace.  EDIT: Also, I'm not holding a anything higher than a 6 against them. I was explaining how a high score can be seen as a negative because that is most likely why this question arose, the candidate in question likely wants to ask if it's good to put their high scores on a resume. I personally shoot to get a 7 or an 8 when afforded the luxury of study time."
actuary,358g7z,zech83,0,Sat May 9 21:20:05 2015 UTC,"The issue is there is no possible way to know how much studying is necessary to achieve any given score until you actually take the exam. And even then, it completely depends on the questions you draw. What if I study to aim for a 6 and get a 10? What if I don't study at all and get a 10? What if I study to get a 10 and get every single question wrong? It's unfair to say someone has poor time management because they scored better than the bare minimum. If I take a final and only need a 70 to get an A, am I going to study for a 70? No, I'm going to study for a 100."

actuary,355ecg,jebuz23,3,Thu May 7 12:53:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Being the only actuary means you're an actuary in title of only, not in practice. Especially starting out. If OP had some industry experience it might be different. But I promise he/she will just be a data analyst who takes exams."

Also, this is just an ancillary company which is two floors above a major health insurer with an actuarial team of 10+. Since I'm the only actuary physically in the office, I'll be working a lot with the actuaries of the parent company.   As for not having someone to be there to study with, I don't really mind because I prefer to study alone anyways."

Exam raises are about 3500 to 4000 for all the prelims except FM which is 2000. FSA exams are 6000. There is also an FSA and ASA bonus. Study time is between 10 to 14 days per exam. I also get a bonus but I don't know the exact percentage. But it is an all right amount.  My benefits aren't even that crazy compared to other people I know but you are getting absolutely ripped off.

actuary,357daq,DopestTrip,-1,Thu May 7 22:37:49 2015 UTC,"It was 10 years ago when I dropped calculus. It was the only class I had to put what I perceived to be ""too much effort"" into, although I did enjoy it. Yes, it was foolish and lazy. I've since gone back and completed my degree, taken statistics, which I loved, and am trying to improve my life by working towards an analytically based career. I can only take my time studying and put more focus into it than anything I've done in my life. Are your choices in life the same as they were a decade before? I know it will be the hardest thing I've done academically, but if I fail, it won't be for lack of intelligence. It will be due to inadequate preparation. Please reconsider with this in mind, and if you have advice about the calculus, I will put it into action. If I pass P, I plan to enroll at UTD for their FM prep class. I don't have the funds to take a lot of formal class, but I did begin by investing in the full CA program. I've also been investing my time and enjoying the frustration and tedious nature of the problems."
actuary,357daq,plnd2ez,3,Thu May 7 21:46:16 2015 UTC,"Dude, you're getting some harsh responses on here, but it is kinda true: you need to be deeply familiar and comfortable with calculus if you want any hope of getting much past P and FM. To more directly answer your question though, I'd say you'd be ok skipping: power series, most trig-related things, vector calc stuff (divergence, gradient, curl, line/surface integrals), and that's about it. Do literally everything else, until you know it forwards and back.  My recommendation would be to not spend your money on classes, but on books and study manuals instead. Buy a standard calc textbook, and work through it voraciously; do every single problem you can (especially with double integrals, I feel like 2/3 of my time prepping for P was doing double integrals). The SOA website has a nice list of recommended reading to prepare for exam P; I think you should head over there, check out a few of those books, and become intimately familiar with their material.

I will start studying for FM this weekend however I have not taken any calculus classes yet. I will take calc I this summer though, before the August sitting. Is it safe to skip those same topics?"
actuary,357daq,g33k101,3,Thu May 7 22:24:08 2015 UTC,"For FM you should be fine with the simpler Calculus concepts. It's much more algebraic, and when you do usw calculus it's mostly exponentials. Learn how to sum series, and focus on interest theory if anything."
actuary,357daq,daveyfck1,1 point,Thu May 7 22:57:34 2015 UTC,Alright! Thank you plnd2ez.
actuary,357daq,daveyfck1,1 point,Thu May 7 23:00:25 2015 UTC,"I am okay with diving into calculus even more, and see it as an investment, even if it's not specifically for P material. If you think it's possible to learn with text and videos, I will try these first. It may take twice as long as a college class, but I've already spent so much money on the CA program, and will have to find a few hundred if I were to enroll right now. I will look on the SOA site further to compare the calculus manuals. I appreciate knowing the few areas where I don't need to focus, so I can practice everything else with more energy. Thank you!"
actuary,357daq,assoyster,3,Thu May 7 22:31:46 2015 UTC,"Lile the others said, if you don't know calculus like the back of your hand you're wasting your time."
actuary,357daq,LordButano,2,Thu May 7 22:41:56 2015 UTC,You definitely need u substitution and integration by parts (or tabular integration). Honestly if you aren't really comfortable evaluating integrals you are going to be screwed on the mgf and multivariate questions.
actuary,357daq,aspiringactuary4,1 point,Thu May 7 18:50:57 2015 UTC,"I've been practicing the basic differentiation and ingegration rules, such as chain rule, power rule, etc. I'm working on integration by parts and u-substitution with definite and indefinite integrals. I am getting more comfortable with integrals the more videos and problems I work. It may take hundreds, but if I know exactly what sub-topics to focus on, it will be a big help. For instance, I see trig used in some of the integration problems, and I assume it's better to use the strictly algebraic examples."
actuary,357daq,jonkl91,2,Thu May 7 21:57:40 2015 UTC,"Learn tabular integration. It's an extension of integration by parts and it will save you SO MUCH time on some common problems. You can safely ignore the trig stuff (for now), as it won't show up on P."
actuary,357daq,jonkl91,2,Thu May 7 23:25:12 2015 UTC,In my opinion you should have the calculus concepts required for P in your back pocket the same way you just know how to factor polynomials or things as simple as that. Otherwise you'll spend too much time any questions that have a calc component. You'll have way bigger fish to fry on that syllabus so I wouldn't touch it until you feel like you have a deep understanding of the prerequisites.
actuary,357daq,aspiringactuary4,2,Thu May 7 22:51:54 2015 UTC,You should be comfortable with integration in multiple variables. Integration by parts seems to come up a lot. You might consider focusing on learning calculus first.
actuary,357daq,ActuariallyInclined,2,Fri May 8 14:10:47 2015 UTC,"Before exam P, I was cocky about math. I shat on every calculus and math course I took, and got a 5 on both HS AP tests without studying a wink. The Exam P material made me fucking cry. More than once. It is incredibly hard. You will have to spend hours and hours and hours, and then more hours, going over the material. Then you will take a practice exam and get absolutely demolished, then you'll have to take your frustration out on something (maybe slam your notebook on to the ground and scream)... then you'll have to painstakingly go over every single mistake you made until you understand that problem so well you'll never make that mistake again.  Part of passing Exam P is being able to quickly and accurately perform double or sometimes triple integrals. Honestly, it sounds like you're going to need to study calculus until July or Sept before you even start studying for P.  There is a reason actuaries get paid well, and it's because it takes more than dedication or smarts alone to pass the exams. It takes large amounts of both. Unfortunately, and I hate to say this, you don't seem cut out for it. The combination of repeatedly dropping calculus in college (I'm assuming Calc I), with getting stuck at univariate probability concepts... It just doesn't bode well."
actuary,357daq,RazarTuk,1 point,Sun May 10 22:15:58 2015 UTC,"I know the prep and passing exam P will be my most intense academic challenge. Maybe I won't be cut out for it. As of now, only part that is making it impossible is my lack of Calculus background. I dropped those classes at least 10 years ago with very little interest in calculus or hard work at the time. It has become apparent I will not be able to get a thorough grasp of calculus (though I like trying!) without formal instruction. I've found a class locally at community college that begins next month and am starting to apply/ register. If I am successful and still enjoy the work at the end of the class, wouldn't that be a better place to assess whether I am capable?"
actuary,357daq,summitbound,2,Mon May 11 17:23:28 2015 UTC,"Yes. The reason people are being so harsh is that you are coming across as naive. You state ""As of now, only part that is making it impossible is my lack of Calculus background"". That's a pretty big thing. That's like me saying the only preventing me from going to college is that I didn't pass high school! Calculus is a foundation of the exams and you need to re-evaluate your timeline. People make mistakes and change and you probably aren't the same person you were 10 years ago. I would say to take Calc 1 to 3 as they just give you the foundation for the exams and once you get past those you will have a better understanding of what you can and can't do. I wish you the best of luck!"

It can't be profitably written in the private sector for the entire market.  Unemployment benefits is another example of this.  For both of them, you can't charge the rates that are needed. You'd have to require nearly everyone to get it to avoid adverse selection, and people living in flood prone areas would have to be subsidized by people in non-flood prone areas.  Even with that, they manage to screw it up. aka the Hurricane Sandy in NJ. That might be a better example of fraud though."
actuary,35228p,ShakeNBakes,2,Wed May 6 17:21:35 2015 UTC,Why is flood insurance better provided by government? Doesn't that just end up as a subsidy to people who foolishly live in flood plains?
actuary,35228p,allofthethings,2,Wed May 6 16:23:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, in a way. But people are going to live there no matter what. Private insurers won't write business there for a reasonable price due to the risk, so very few people could afford it. And who would be left to pick up the pieces after something like Katrina that causes widespread flooding? The government.

Which improves quality, etc., and may lower cost to consumers even after accounting for the higher fixed costs. Deprivatization in general brings about many of the same effects as a private monopoly would.  Access to a variety of products also benefits consumers directly in that plans with the same cost from an actuarial standpoint may have different values from a consumer utility standpoint."

There was a comment here recently that said ""you only pass an actuarial exam once, so make the most of it"". I'm inclined to agree. A high grade in a class or actuarial exam means you have a stronger foundation for future material.    I agree there may be diminishing returns to the time you commit to studying. 10 hours gets you an A-, but 30 hours will get you an A. Sometimes that happens. Draw the line where you see fit.    Personally I aim for as high a score as possible. Programming I do as a lower priority, when the studying is done."
actuary,3525kr,aMunster,2,Wed May 6 14:52:47 2015 UTC,"whilst I do agree, I'm wondering if it matters to an employer. In the UK all the employers can see is your grade. The highest is a 1st class degree, which requires an average of 70%. The extra studying required to get higher I just feel as though I'm doing it for the exam rather than for pure knowledge."
actuary,3525kr,Servaphetic,2,Wed May 6 14:56:38 2015 UTC,"For graduate schemes, you are applying before you receive your final grade specification. Many online applications (Deloitte, KPMG, Aon-Hewitt etc) will require you to input both your expected grade and the grades you have received in your modules so far, so they'll see there if you're scraping a first or getting 90%+. Whether a recruiter in HR will find this interesting is another question, but, in my opinion at least, you should aim to score as highly as possible. If nothing else, like aMunster said, you'll undoubtedly have a better understanding of the material if you do extra studying."

Once you have your first job, your degree almost becomes irrelevant, and nobody will care what grade you got. Apart from the person who read my CV and decided to give me a phone interview, nobody ever asked me what I got.  If you ever decided to go back to studying, for example a PhD, then I'm sure your marks will become relevant again.  From a pure ""getting a graduate job"" perspective, at least in my company, they would rather hire somebody with a 2.1 and work experience (not necessary relevant - retail, bar work etc) than somebody with a first and no experience.  The hiring manager who hired me actually told me that work experience was the most important thing they were looking for, and that they wouldn't hire somebody who has never had some sort of part time job.  You may find the high mark more satisfying, if so go for it. Don't expect it to guarantee you a job though!

actuary,3525kr,sitsathomeallday,1 point,Wed May 6 15:38:55 2015 UTC,"There's no point getting a high first unless it is for your own, personal self satisfaction.   Once you land your graduate job, no one will really care what degree you studied.   When trying to land your graduate job, noone will really care about what your module scores are.   Work experience and personability count for far more than any other factor. The degree criteria is just a filter - to wither 5000 applicants down to 2000. Then after that, the degree is somewhat irrelevant.   Use your time to do something fun  or interesting. You'll probably end up talking about your interesting travelling, or the football team, more than you will about your statistics module, in an interview."
actuary,3525kr,user_naem,1 point,Wed May 6 19:45:19 2015 UTC,It is worth studying for really high marks if you have a realistic chance of winning some sort of undergrad performance prize or if you simply like studying. Otherwise there are probably better ways of spending your time.   The difference between a bare first and a really good first is minimal as most places are after 2:1 or higher. Even those shops which ask for transcripts won't care.
actuary,3525kr,Mogmiester,1 point,Wed May 6 21:32:22 2015 UTC,"Short answer: No  Longer answer: Nobody asks (or cares, really) how good of a grade you got.

Keep your head up, keep improving your resume and skills, and you'll land one. With that said, limiting your search to 1 city will make things more difficult.   Also, assuming you'll pass actuarial exams, especially close together is kiinnnda risky.

My thesis, along with the fact that my uni has no actuarial degree or club, made it clear that I'm great at independently working and studying.

I think the ADAPT exams are hard to gauge your progress as well, because different scores mean different things depending on your earned level. What other people have said is true. ADAPT lets you easily look at what sections you do poorly in, and creates quizzes for those sections. You'll hate it, because you quite literally are quizzing yourself on the worst subjects. But you'll learn and do better on your next exams.   I recommend taking the TIA practice exams (the first 4 are free). If you can consistently get 20/30 on those I'd say you're good to go.

I personally recommend using The Infinite Actuary for lessons.  I don't like books/manuals.  I have used TIA for all the prelims I have taken so far and it has worked great.  I would highly recommend purchasing TIA and then looking at the video lesson list.  Paying attention to length of videos, etc, I would then make a schedule for each day between now and 10 days prior to the exam.  Then I would use the last 10 days to do practice exams.  I highly recommend using ADAPT from Coaching actuaries for the last 10 days.  It really helps identify problem areas, build confidence, and if you take it seriously it will prepare you for the test environment.  That has been my go to route, and I have successfully passed several exams in roughly the same time line you are looking at while going to school full time and working full time."

actuary,34s1rz,tf113,1 point,Mon May 4 03:12:51 2015 UTC,"It really works well for me.  They go through the material, then do an example problem or two.  I follow that up with a few practice problems then on to the next one.  I am typically a pretty fast learner though and I know some people who need much more time and dedication to each subject.    Good luck.  If you end up getting ADAPT, a word of advice.  My buddy and I study together.  We are both older, career changers, and we had heard that the exams were SO HARD.  Because of this we stressed a lot and got our earned level up to over 8 (in about 10 days.)  It paid off well as we both passed with great scores, but in reality the actual exam is about difficulty 5ish.  If you take it seriously, meaning sit down for 3 hours and don't cheat or look at notes, then getting to level 6 or 7 will really signify that you are going to pass.  For some reason, I see a lot of people get hung up on level 3 or 4.  I guess they didn't learn the material that well because for most of these exams the first time through ADAPT we get a level bump up to at least 4.5 or higher.  So for anyone reading this, if you are struggling and not getting to level 6 or 7 within only a few tests, you probably didn't spend enough time on the material."

actuary,34s1rz,whataguy,3,Mon May 4 03:08:00 2015 UTC,"Well if you want to be an actuary, you'll need to spend a lot of time working out practice problems that aren't exactly grounded in reality. Keep that in mind.  FM is easier than P overall, in my opinion, even if you don't have a background in finance. If you're going to take more calc classes (P covers concepts up to third-semester calc), take FM first so you have a chance to cover some of that material before P. If you're not going to take any more math classes anyway, it doesn't make much difference, though taking FM first still wouldn't be a bad idea given your background."
actuary,34s1rz,colonelsmoothie,1 point,Mon May 4 03:25:33 2015 UTC,"I've commented above that you can likely do P in this time, but I would say that FM is much easier in this time frame.  P is simply a lot of material if you haven't had much exposure to discrete and continuous probability.  Also, you will need to do basic integration, integration by parts mostly.  If the following topics are completely foreign to you, that would be a bad sign: sets and subsets, counting, combinatorics, probability distributions, z-table, double integration, change variable.  In contrast, I studied for FM in 6 weeks with no prior exposure to any of the material.  I simply used TIA and then ADAPT and it worked great.  I'm not sure I could have done that with P.  With P I had taken discreet and continuous probability as well as calc 2 (integration).  Then I just needed about 2-3 weeks of exam specific study and I was good to go.    Frankly, unless someone has taken discreet and continuous probability I would say that FM is much easier."

actuary,34mx8x,jenkinsear,1 point,Sat May 2 19:46:32 2015 UTC,I know that one of the reasons the FM syllabus got reduced was because college classes weren't able to cover all the material in one semester.
actuary,34mx8x,ActuariallyInclined,8,Sat May 2 20:13:34 2015 UTC,"Weird, that seems backwards to me. Colleges should be asked to bend to the syllabus the soa believes is appropriate not the other way around."
actuary,34mx8x,jenkinsear,3,Sat May 2 20:31:59 2015 UTC,"It's really strange. It seems like the sole reason for changing FM is to cater to schools.  Here's an excerpt from the SOA Document   With the added derivatives material, FM cannot be covered in one semester. Most schools have taken one of two approaches. One is to place the FM derivatives material into a second course, which then also starts coverage of MFE. This shifts the problem, but does not solve it. The other is to offer FM as a four credit course. This creates several logistical problems. Moving the derivatives material to MFE may alleviate this problem. Candidates (regardless of where they study or work) must buy two books for FM. While the second book (McDonald) will carry them through MFE, the SOA has many candidates who take FM but not MFE. This is an expensive burden.  Furthermore, at some schools, the MFE course uses a different book altogether."
actuary,34mx8x,ActuariallyInclined,1 point,Sat May 2 21:38:54 2015 UTC,"As a student about to finish college, option 1 was what my school did. A course for 3/4 of FM, then a course that finished FM and started MFE, and finally a course that covered the last 2/3 or so of MFE.  I didn't really have an issue with it. I guess it could be difficult logistically (though not extraordinarily) if a student wants to have FM exam completed before they interview for an internship fall of junior year and they need to complete two courses to cover the material."

It's sold by an insurance company and based on an agreed number of lives. It might be, for example, that the scheme only derisks the pensions in payment but not the active or deferred members, or alternatively only buys the bulk annuity for lives with the largest pensions (as the largest 10% of lives might have 50%+ of the liabilities)."

I'm sure the markup on these jerseys is huge, so the company definitely comes out ahead even if they sell jerseys for half price. It's a neat concept, but definitely not practical."

If you think there is more than a 1/7.5=13.3% chance that he will get traded, buy the insurance.  From the company's perspective, they probably buy the jerseys wholesale for about $50 so even if a person collects, they make $25 profit instead of $100.

His reasoning was that it's unlikely that ""you'd have to go through all 38 numbers before hitting the one you picked"".  The flaw is of course you'll likely hit multiple numbers multiple times, but still it was intriguing and after some research I discovered that you actually have a ~61% chance of hitting your number before running out of money.  I made an excel sheet simulating this, making sure I could recreate the 61% figure so I knew the model was right.  The reason the house still has the advantage is that the variance absolutely kills you.  If everyone went to a casino and played till their number hit, there would be those that took hundreds and hundreds of spins to get there, which I saw in my model.  So we agreed to just stop after ~40 ish spins and hope that 61% was on our side.

You also mention an appreciation between mean and variance.

You get -x with probability 37/38 and 35x (or whatever they give you) with probability 1/38.  In fact the variance is the reason anyone gets hooked on gambling. If you want the best chances of winning the most money you should put all of your money on your first bet, the more trials you play the less variance has to do with it and the quicker your results will reflect the known probability (law of large numbers)."

I try to avoid work-related thoughts when I'm not at work. Come to think of it, why am I even here on a Saturday?"
actuary,34kx9u,PassionVoid,1 point,Sat May 2 15:20:35 2015 UTC,I was in a pick-em league with some co-workers. We all had our own spreadsheets to make our picks.  Mine used a Monte-Carlo type calculation. It didn't work very well.
actuary,34kx9u,glberns,2,Sat May 2 16:55:42 2015 UTC,"I program for fun, if that counts?  I play WoW, so all the RNG aspects of the game I'm constantly applying actuarial knowledge too.  It's sort of amazing how many people just don't get probability.  There's a part of the game where you send your followers (computer characters) on quests, and if those quests are successful, you get a bonus.  The game tells you the chance of being successful; (part of the game is picking the right followers to maximize your chance of success).  Some times people in chat will have a 96% chance of success and the quest fails.  Inevitable people start talking about how the game 'must be broken' or to 'submit a ticket'.  I used to try to explain that 96% chance of success means we should expect 4/100 to fail, and since thousands of people are running these quests it's not unreasonable that this person happened to be one of those 4.  I don't try to explain that anymore.  I also watch a lot of sports so I'm typically analyzing the sports analysts opinions and statistics.  For example, a certain player leads the league in playoff goals scored.  Does that mean he's the best playoff goal scorer?  Maybe not, some series go to seven games, other end in 4.  Maybe he's just had more games to score in because his team can win a series early.  Or sometimes if a team is down by one or two, they'll pull their goalie for an extra attacker.  It gives them a better chance to score at the risk of making it very easy to be scored on (goals scored on an empty net are called 'empty net goals').  If this league leading goal scorer score a large of of his goals as empty net goals, that IMO should be the same as some one score a lot of full strength goals.  I'm fun at parties, trust me :-)    One that I think people around me honestly enjoyed though was when I ran a confidence pool last NFL season at work.  Instead of just the typical 'most confidence points wins' I had some trophies for 'Most weeks won', 'Most Efficient picks' etc. Even had a play-off bracket.  Used a lot of Excel for that, which made it super easy."
actuary,34kx9u,jebuz23,1 point,Sat May 2 16:28:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wouldn't say that I really USE the knowledge for my hobbies, but I too think a lot about the more subtle stats aspects of sports like you described.  My old roommate is an actuary as well and we're both huge college football fans, and he's pointed out that a lot of coaches seem to make the mistake of playing things ""by the book"" (as far as when to run/pass, when to go for it on 4th, when to kick FG/punt, etc.) when really they should deviate from it based on the flow of the game.  Example, if it's a low scoring game, field position is more critical, so be more conservative, if it's a high scoring game, you're not going to catch up by kicking FG's etc.    Every once in a while you hear of a high school coach who goes for it on 4th every time.  Obviously high-risk but when you looked at their stats the gains from those risky plays made it worth it.  Just think how it changes the game if the D has to STOP you 4 times in a row every single drive.  In high school a teacher once explained a practical application of standard deviation as follows:  if you're in a 4th and 2 type situation, you'd rather have an RB that averages 3 or 4 yards a carry with a low std than one you gets 10-15 yards a carry with a higher variance.  Not sure if that's the kind of info teams track but cool to think about nonetheless."
actuary,34kx9u,spartanburt,1 point,Sat May 2 20:47:17 2015 UTC,"Some teams might track that type of stuff. I know that some hockey teams have moved into ""higher analytics"".   It sort of reminds me of a good example of ""bad stats"" in which a certain outfielder has a high number of errors. The short version is that he has so many errors because he attempts hard plays, as opposed to not even attempting (which in turn doesn't get recorded as an error). I would love the opportunity to work for a team I love (I'm from Chicago so Cubs/Hawks/Bears/Bulls) in the front office analyzing these higher level stats and recommending plays/players as a result."

If it's not on a resume, we assume it's not good enough to meet the threshold.  However, I do agree that working on technical skills and higher level conceptual understanding so you can automate useful things would be good areas of focus.

actuary,34l2ui,MindYourQsandPs,3,Sat May 2 02:31:54 2015 UTC,"I posted this because I wanted to give a little insight into how difficult it can be to change a public pension plan, especially a big one.  Think about it.  States have thousands - tens of thousands - of employees.  They usually require some sort of law to start and change a pension fund.  In this case, the Oregon legislature passed two bills targeted at ending a COLA and a supplement.  I'm not intimately familiar with Oregon, but I'm guessing that passing a couple bills takes awhile and the effort of several dozen people.  Bills to change public pension funds can get contentious and frequently attract media attention.  Now, two years later, the courts strike one of these laws down.  The other one, they find, is constitutionally protected.  Essentially, to eliminate the COLA, you have to now deal not just with laws, but with Oregon's constitution.  Good luck with that.  Discussion is welcome, as always.  P.S. Favorite line from the article: ""That will create an 'actuarial nightmare,' OSBA's Green said.""  At least someone is thinking of the poor valuation actuaries."

actuary,34fclj,trapperjustin,2,Thu Apr 30 18:00:40 2015 UTC,You need to expand on a few sections.  It's like there is no content at all...
actuary,34fclj,lametown_poopypants,2,Thu Apr 30 20:03:16 2015 UTC,"I would revise the exam sections to be either all SOA or all CAS.  Make 2 versions of the resume, send the right one when applying for jobs.  It isn't that hard.    Agree with /u/s4gres about the need to quantify your accomplishments and re-wording your bullets.  The one about minimal direction just makes it seem like you pissed away the time without supervision.    I don't love the qualifications section, but it's not terrible.  I would emphasize other items than just Excel in the MS suite.  VBA is good to note, or common programming languages like C.    Edit - If this resume crossed my desk when I had my position open a few months ago, I wouldn't have interviewed you.  No offense implied, but giving you my opinion as someone who hires."

actuary,34f17i,verkacat,3,Thu Apr 30 16:37:03 2015 UTC,Honestly? You could probably pass right now if your truly comfortable with all of that. But it'd be iffy. A month should be more than enough to grind on some office exams. Buy yourself 2 weeks of adapt and do nothing but exams up until your test day.
actuary,34f17i,logrusmage,3,Thu Apr 30 18:59:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, especially given your advanced coverage.  I studied around that same amount of time, and about the same daily hours and I passed easily.  I had never seen any of the material and was completely ignorant.  If possible, get through the material with 4-6 days and then do adapt exams.  I felt that method worked great for me."
actuary,34f17i,whataguy,4,Fri May 1 02:05:51 2015 UTC,"It's enough time, but you have little margin for error. A skipped study day will set you back seriously."
actuary,34f17i,colonelsmoothie,2,Thu Apr 30 16:49:54 2015 UTC,Yeah but if that happens I figure I can make up the hours on a different day. (Not that I plan on skipping study days!)  Thanks :)
actuary,34f17i,s4gres,2,Thu Apr 30 16:58:47 2015 UTC,"yeah, if you're smart"
actuary,34f17i,MuffinMopper,2,Thu Apr 30 20:48:04 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't have been enough for me.  I studied on and off for about 3 months, with a couple weeks were I wasn't working.  Although obviously, if you know how to answer all the questions its enough time."
actuary,34f17i,Frustrated_Walrus,2,Thu Apr 30 21:42:36 2015 UTC,Buckle up.
actuary,34f17i,sozzZ,2,Fri May 1 00:17:46 2015 UTC,"Yes but you'd have to be dedicated. I would spend one week drilling derivatives: different payoffs like butterfly, collar, straddle, etc. Also put-call parity and swaps are important. Then spend the rest of your time doing practice problems and memorizing formulas. I also assume you have mastered the financial calculator, that's a big time saver.  May I ask why you're only studying five days a week? With such a narrow margin for error I can only recommend studying every day if you don't want to end up with a 5."
actuary,34f17i,ActuariallyInclined,1 point,Fri May 1 02:40:02 2015 UTC,Yeah that wasn't covered in my courses. Thanks.  I have yet to buy a financial calculator. But I will! Soon! We weren't allowed to use one for the course I took.  I'm living away from home this summer and was going to use the weekends to visit family and boyfriend. Perhaps I'll spend more than 4 hours studying during the weekdays.
actuary,34f17i,wewaysawin,2,Fri May 1 02:57:27 2015 UTC,That should be enough time. It sounds like you already know 80% of the material. Just make sure you do a lot of practice problems.
actuary,34f17i,SweetGeorgiaSam,2,Fri May 1 03:30:45 2015 UTC,"It took me 75 hours starting from scratch and got a 9.  I think 80 is enough even if you know the material.  There will be new topics for you and you'll need to get used to the ""trick"" questions where they give you a variant that prohibits you from directly using the formulas.  I'd get the syllabus and read everything you don't know (like derivatives markets maybe). Then do coaching actuaries to practice the problems types,  and see if you really know your stuff as well as you think."

actuary,34dqi0,actuaryresume,3,Thu Apr 30 09:17:02 2015 UTC,"Just some things to consider, I'm certainly no expert, but below are a couple things that came to mind as I read your resume:  You might want to include some key words when describing your excel skills (e. g. used Excel to analyze and create monthly reports using such functions as vlookup, sumif, and pivot tables).  From what I've heard some places filter their applications based on key words before a human ever even looks at the resume.  A friend of mine went from no calls in 2 months of applying to 2-3 interviews in the same week after adding keywords to his resume (This was in the fall, so it could have nothing to do with his resume, but it also doesn't hurt)  Some have said that it's appropriate to only next the next exam you're sitting for.  Otherwise you're sort of counting your chickens before they hatch.   I'm not 100% sure about that, but something to consider.  I personally struggled a lot with my skills section.  I consider myself fairly well-versed with technical skills, but also didn't want to oversell myself and seem like I was lying.  ""How do I communicate exactly how skilled I am in excel, sql, etc.""   When I told people that as an actuary I needed to be very good at excel, they would tell me they were very good at excel, but then wouldn't even know that you could put functions in cells.  How could I make it clear that my skills in excel go past just using a glorified table layout?  I ended up putting some bullet points to go in detail on my excel skills and then list other skills i had."
actuary,34dqi0,jebuz23,3,Thu Apr 30 11:46:57 2015 UTC,I'm not a fan of putting things on your resume that you haven't accomplished yet.

(Especially if becoming an actuary doesn't pan out for you - everyone knows what statistics is, not everyone knows what actuarial science is.) I wouldn't worry about the lack of exam-specific classes in the statistics major - first of all, a probability class will be required as a statistics major (likely the same class that is required for actuarial science majors), and you can take classes on the other exam topics as electives. Second, actuarial exams are all about self-study. Even with a probability class, you'll need to do many practice problems on your own. Once you get out of college, there won't be any structured classes - so if you can't pass the earlier exams without any a class, you'll have a hard time passing the later exams."

actuary,34csqx,actuariallyesteban,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:45:50 2015 UTC,"Hi, thank you for commenting. Do you think the major's exam tailored classes helped you prepare for exams more than regular math classes would? Did you manage to get an internship through UCSB? How was your life after graduation and job searching? Is the UCSB Act Sci department well know within the actuary community? Sorry, I have never met anyone who went there for act sci."
actuary,34csqx,actuariallyesteban,1 point,Sat May 2 04:23:02 2015 UTC,"There are classes for all the SOA prelims (P, FM, MLC, MFE, C) but they you wont be able to pass an exam with just the class. The exams are much more in depth than what the classes cover. However it does help studying for the exam easier since you have most of the basic knowledge down.   I wasn't a very good student so I did not get an internship but luckily was able to find an entry level actuarial position a couple months ago."

actuary,347o5g,watersign,3,Wed Apr 29 00:23:50 2015 UTC,It may look bad to have a gap in your employment history... Maybe a month or two tops but other than that it might look bad to companies. But that's just what I've gathered from reading career threads
actuary,347o5g,Boogertits,2,Tue Apr 28 23:43:19 2015 UTC,"That's a shame; everything should not be about work... Even if I decided to go on a backpacking trip, or ski-bum for a winter would that be true?    Is it relatively bad to take a break because of the fact that corporations want you to keep progressing your career, or the fact they want someone who is controllable/less likely to leave on a whim?"
actuary,347o5g,jebuz23,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:22:58 2015 UTC,"It's a lot of things.  You're right, there's a differences between choosing to not work for a while (e.g. backpacking trip) vs. not be able to find work for a while, but it's very hard for companies to see the difference on paper.  All they see is that you didn't have a job for 6 months.  If it's the latter, then they start to think there is some reason you weren't getting hired by other companies.  Even if they don't see that reason, do they really want to make the mistake that other companies avoided?  Plus, even if it was by choice and you're still a very capable employee, that was 6 months you weren't developing your skills, and even worse, forgetting some of them.  Remember, the job market is competitive.  It's  certainly important for you to do what makes you happy, but each blemish moves you a little lower in the pile, and if you don't have enough positive traits to make you stand out, having an extended leave from work could be the difference between getting that interview or not.   they want someone who is controllable/less likely to leave on a whim?   Of course they don't want someone who is likely to leave on a whim.  Who would?  ""Hire me but I might bail""?  They need to feel like you're a worthwhile investment."

That said, have you voiced these concerns more directly with your manager? If you're going to quit if things keep going the way they're going, there's not much to lose in asking more directly for greater responsibility or a change to a different role."
actuary,347o5g,hello61,2,Tue Apr 28 23:46:33 2015 UTC,"More so than less. I asked for more responsibility, but the fact is our company does not seem to stray far from the monthly monitoring bullshit."

actuary,347o5g,colonelsmoothie,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:32:28 2015 UTC,I've heard it's much easier to find another job when you're already employed? So I would definitely look for av better position but don't quit outright until you have that new job. My .02 cents.
actuary,347o5g,SixMileDrive,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:15:15 2015 UTC,Hi. Get a new job before quitting. Set the start date for your new job to be 1 month out in the future so you get some time to travel.

actuary,3418g6,jplank1983,5,Mon Apr 27 17:57:15 2015 UTC,"EDIT: WARNING, LONG RANT.  I have pretty much accepted I'm not passing this time. I'm sure I will get a 4 or 5 which is ultra depressing since this is technically my last exam.  Is there ANY initiative to improve the quality of questions? I feel like FSA exams are 50% memorization, 40% trying to decipher what knowledge they want you to vomit on paper, and maybe 10% of analysis/critical thinking (which largely ends up be rattling off a memorized pros/cons list). What exactly is this proving? I have the bulk of the knowledge, but you really have to be able to answer EVERYTHING since you never know if you are interpreting their question correctly.  And this shows in the answers to the old exams. When they start the answer with ""Many candidates performed poorly.."" and then blame it on them not doing something right, not because the question is faulty. Or because it is insanely specific and obscure, like they comb through the study manuals for the few paragraphs that weren't covered and make a question based off of that.  If they want to pass roughly 40% of candidates then they should feel free. But they just artificially make this happen by the awful questions. If the questions are reasonable and relevant to the material then the tests would be so much less frustrating. I am not learning anything here.  The time constraints too. They say they are trying to test how well you understand the material but you don't even have the time to really think or consider a lot of things. It's just a knowledge dump of anything remotely related. I have no idea what imposing a strict time limits accomplishes. For every FSA exam I've taken I am basically writing the entire time and then don't have the time to go back and reconsider anything. If they gave more time they could ask some questions that actually tested your critical thinking skills.  Oh, and the FAP and FSA modules have the same problem of insanely poorly worded questions with tangential relation to the material covered, but at least those they generally give you some feedback about why you didn't pass. I have pretty much accepted that my first submissions are always going to fail and then I will get feedback about what they were really looking for and pass on the second submission.  And the worst part is I feel like the skills required to pass these exams have zero relation to your professional ability.  /endrant"
actuary,3418g6,AsSubtleAsABrick,6,Mon Apr 27 21:08:40 2015 UTC,"God, I am so with you on this. I was looking over the last LFV-U exam this weekend to prepare.  One question asked a calculation question that was off the syllabus - it appeared later in the reading on a page that wasn't on the syllabus. Their comment in the solution?   It was expected that candidates would also be able to apply their knowledge of correlation matrices to calculate diversified economic capital. The majority of candidates attempted to calculate the diversified EC measures and many got partial credits, some also did well in completing the calculations.   No, I'm sorry, I shouldn't be required to remember how to calculate something that briefly appeared in the FAP modules.  Another question's answer:   Only 21% of candidates were able to correctly provide the complete formula.   Well gee, don't you think that maybe this was a really bad question then?  And then for my favorite. The question asked:   Calculate the DAC at 12/31/2013 using projected cashflows assuming unrealized capital gain of 100.   The solution?   This question provided less information than is required to provide a numerical solution. The top candidates recognized this.   WHAT THE FUCK YOU CAN'T GIVE US A TON OF NUMBERS AND TELL US TO CALCULATE ONLY TO BE LIKE ""Just kidding, we didn't actually give you enough information, this was actually a trick to find out who actually knew this lolololol""  /endrant"

I feel like the FSA exams are a lot better than the FAP modules though. I'm not sure what feedback you're talking about. At least with respect to the interim and final assessment, all you get is ""questions x and y were pretty bad"" but that doesn't mean the other questions were good, just that those two were the worst. So you have to redo it blind.  What irritates me the most is when there are mistakes in the model solutions. How much effort is it to get your own rubric corrected so that we can learn from it."

actuary,3418g6,TrueBlonde,2,Wed Apr 29 22:14:47 2015 UTC,Which is fair. But you think they'd take the time to double check things.

Notice that the RV x|y=10 is the intersection of two sets of points:    The set of points where 0<x<y<50 (the purple triangle) the set of points where y=10 (the line).   The only places where those two sets intersect are on the line, and only between 0<x<10.  Since all points in the purple triangle (including those on the line) are equally likely, X|y=10~U(0,10)."

With exam P, you can benefit a lot from memorizing the formulas instead of deriving them each time. Do a practice problem. Pretty self explanatory.  Do problems of chapters you're weakest in first. Read chapters of the manual (if you haven't read them already.)   I would highly recommend buying or making your own flashcards for studying if you have small gaps of free time at work.

If I were you, I'd just stick to an Ontario school since you are from there. Personally I think Waterloo will be better for your career as an actuary than UoT because of the famous coop program.

From a hiring standpoint, UWaterloo students do give a better impression than UT (presumably due to extensive interviewing experience). However, being a UWaterloo alumni myself, I must say that going to UWaterloo does not gurantee you an Actsci job. It increases your chances but you still need to compete with other UWaterloo students and the current lack of demand. Majority of my classmates in Actsci ended up not finding Actsci positions and working in other (related) fields.  This is for Ontario..

All the statistics about the actuarial profession in America do not apply to Canada because the supply and demand for actuaries is drastically different. There are fewer private healthcare plans here due to public healthcare and less demand for liability/casualty insurance due to the legal system. Getting an H1-B visa to work down south is not realistic for a recent graduate. For example, my university produces ~40 graduates every year even though my province (Alberta) only has about 5-10 entry level job postings per year. I passed 3 exams in less than a year, had a 3.6 GPA and never heard back from any internships or employers. The starting pay is only about $40-50K because the market is so saturated.

I struggled in upper division courses- real analysis, algebra, linear algebra. The concepts didn't come natural to me, and I didn't understand everything at first, or second, or third time around. But generally, I am much better at math than other subjects, which is probably more because I enjoyed math in high school and college and did not care much for other subjects rather than naturally being good at math. Nowadays I prefer to learn about humanities and social science (history, ethnic studies, sociology, geography), which is something I now wish I would have studied before I graduated.

Really, as long as you're good at algebra and calculus, you've got the math skills you need. That's about 20% of what it takes to pass these exams.

Actuarial work rarely attracts people who can breeze through the all of the exams. Those people get bored with the tedium of the job.  Creating such a dichotomy is dangerous. You are automatically giving yourself an out by allowing the idea ""I'm not gifted at that."" A healthier way to approach it is to say ""I did not put the work in to pass."" This mindset will allow you to deal with failure in a more constructive way. When you fail you can figure out how you can work harder or smarter, instead of saying ""I'm not smart enough."""

actuary,33qnrl,ryunator,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:29:43 2015 UTC,"Oh I see. The p' and q' is what is confusing you. Here is how I think about it. If we draw the double decrement diagram p1 is the probability of going to state 1, and p2 is the probability of going to state 2. This is the part that you probably understand. So what does p'1 and p'2 represent? The book says that they are the probability independent of all other probabilities (or if the other probabilities didn't exist), and it's not really intuitive what that means.   So I draw a picture.   What would it look like if we ignored all other forces of mortality? Well, it would look like a single decrement model.  0 --> 1  So 0 goes to 1 with probability p'1, if u1 was the only force of mortality. That is the the definition of p'1. We can solve all the things in this simplified model using the formulas we're already familiar with.   Most commanly p'1=e-integral(udt)  And simularly we can draw a picture of p'2 and solve things about it.  0-->2   Ok, that was fun, but the problem is not asking us about single decrement, it's asking us about a double decrement  0-->1  v  2  Those probabilities are pretty much useless in this setting. Luckily we know some things connecting the two. Such that the u1 (t) is the same as what we used in the single decrement model. (since the p'1 is defined as what the probability would be if u1 (t) was the only decrement). We can use all our multiple decrement formulas:   pT = e-integral u1 t+u2 t  q1 = integral(pT*u1 (t))  q2 = integral(pT*u2 (t))  and we can use the formulas we have equating p with p'.  With all that said and done, here is the solution.  We are given q'1 = .04 so that's in the single decrement model.  0-->1  In this model we know that p'1=e-integral(u(t*dt))  (1-.04) = e-integral(u(t*dt))  u in this decrement is 0.2kt2  .96 = e-0.2k/3   You should get k ~ 0.612  Now that we know k we can calculate the 2q2. So we need u2. Since uT = u1+ u2, you should be able to get that u2 = 0.8kt2  The official solution solved for the 2q2 by remembering that   2q2 = integral(2pT*u2 (t))  =integral(e-kt2x0.8kt2 )  and solving this integral, but I set it up and didn't feel like doing integration by parts. So I solved it a different way.   I used the formula 2p'2 = 2pTexp(2q2 /2qT)  So I just needed 2p'2 and 2pT. For that remember that 2pT = 2p'1x2p'2.  So let's go back to our single decrement models  0-->1  2p'1 = e-0.2k*8/3   0-->2  2p'2 = e-0.8k*8/3   2pT = e-k*8/3 or (2p'1x2p'2 )  Then we have all the elements to solve the problem, and you should get 0.64 answer D.  I know this seems like a long solution, but a lot of this is explination. All this took me about 5 lines of work on my paper. I skipped a lot of steps, but let me know if this makes sense to you, or if you don't understand a particular step."

Geography has a significant impact on health cost even outside of unit costs or practice patterns of providers. Local attitudes toward health, exercise, eating habits etc can be major drivers of costs in a region so I'm not surprised these pockets exist where behaviors have a large impact on outcomes.  I would be interested to break apart genetics and general health status from behaviors. It seems like some of these pockets are likely somewhat homogenous in terms of genetic makeup so it would be interesting to try to analyze individuals of similar genetics living elsewhere to try to normalize to just the impact of lifestyle related factors and regional attitudes/actions."

actuary,33aulh,TrueBlonde,4,Tue Apr 21 11:48:36 2015 UTC,"This is 100% true, and I appreciate you reiterating this fact. I have a weakness for helping others and do so for my career, sacrificing my own needs in the process. I think just never feeling like a priority is starting to get to me in ways I wish it wouldn't."
actuary,33aulh,aspiringactuary,7,Tue Apr 21 13:03:57 2015 UTC,"Another poster said ""if he wanted to find an hour to have dinner with you he would find it."" I think this is true, but it also needs qualifications.  Personal anecdote: I'm super busy with exams and pretty much was committed to not dating until I finished, because I just didn't have time. Then, I met someone. Do I have a ton of time to spend with him? No. But I make sure that 3 nights a week I make time for us to hang out. Sometimes it's him coming over at 9pm and watching 2 hours of TV before we go to bed. Sometimes I have more time. But I always make time for him.  There's a difference between my relationship and yours, though. My bf and I have been together for < 6 months. You guys have been together for > 12 months. Your bf probably knows that your relationship is ""safe"" - you've gotten past the initial getting to know each other stage, you're both on the same page about it being long term, and so he's confident enough in your relationship that he knows he can kind of disappear for a few months and you guys will survive.  Is that totally fair of him? Not really. Does it suck? Most definitely.  So why can't he spend an hour with you every night? Well, after a long day of thinking and always being ""on,"" sometimes the last thing an actuary (I'm stereotyping here) wants to do is something else you have to be ""on"" for. Actuaries are often introverts, and even though I'm sure he enjoys spending time with you, it's just another thing that would drain his energy.  I know it sucks, but try to find unconventional ways to spend time together. He has to eat, right? Maybe you could go to the grocery store together or meet him at McD's on his way home. He needs to shower every day. Maybe he works out. Try to find small ways to integrate yourself into things he already has to do every day just to get 5-10 minutes of quality time with him. It's not adding anything to his plate since it's something he already has to do.  As for the dinner with his parents - hold off on that. Sometimes when I'm super busy with exams/work, I know that I need to put things off until afterwards. Knowing that I'm putting things off is almost as stressful as not putting them off. Like, pretend you have a gallon of water you have to drink. As long as you know that's all you have to do, you can manage it. Adding things to do later - like dinners - is like placing water bottles next to the gallon and saying ""hey, I know that gallon is a lot so I'm not going to make you drink this water bottle now, but once it's gone you'll need to drink this too."""
actuary,33aulh,venomoushealer,2,Tue Apr 21 13:31:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you, thank you, TrueBlonde! Your feedback and suggestions are really helpful.   He's absolutely an introvert and your analogy helps put things in perspective. I think you're also correct about being in the safe zone at this point.   Acknowledging all that and having a better understanding of the workload, I still wish he would make an effort every now and then like you do for your significant other. It sounds like a lot of actuaries recognize the toll it takes on their SO, and I'm not sure that's the case here. His attitude is very much, ""it is what it is,"" and that's what I think is making this much more difficult for me."
actuary,33aulh,dinapolice,13,Wed Apr 22 20:53:50 2015 UTC,"Medicare actuary here.  Bid Season is a monster. My fiance and I are very independent people, but the solitude imposed on her during Bid Season is pretty demanding. Of course, I feel bad about not giving her the attention she is due, but we always more than make up for it with summer vacations and fall quality time.  It may seem like poor prioritization, but preparing for a spring exam and filing Medicare bids is enough to stress out the most experienced analysts.  The business demands between Feb and June are hard to believe, but I assure you that they exist. It isn't uncommon to work 100+ hour weeks. No matter the amount of preparation we put in, some new curveball comes along that throws a wrench in even the most well laid plans.  Even the few moments that we can come up for air, the last thing we want to do is have plans or be obligated to do anything......for anyone. This includes ""we"" time.    Tl;Dr Bid Season is no joke. Anything that can cause stress should be avoided.  Being available without having expectations is one of the biggest gifts my fiance gives me when she doesn't have to."

He's an FSA so exams are no longer a factor, but he is putting in ~14 hour days, 7 days a week right now. I admire his work ethic, think he's worth it, and want to be okay with all of this...but no matter how I rationalize it, my needs are being neglected and it's affecting me in ways I wish it wouldn't.    Not to stereotype, but his weakness is definitely communication. A little effort in changing how he says things would go a long way in making me feel like more of a priority. But I know now's not the time to bring that up, either. I agree with venomoushealer, bid season can fuck itself."

actuary,33aulh,pixienat,2,Tue Apr 21 22:22:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. It's a consulting firm with a small office so I know the expectation to pour in tons of hours is there. I guess what I really was hoping to find out is if anyone ever says ""I'm taking off at 7 tonight so that I can celebrate my girlfriend's birthday.""

Apart from at a ridiculously senior level (I.e. exec-director level), where you're not really an actuary anymore anyway. Even contractors would rarely do this. The actuarial profession is one with a valuable qualification but you're really only fully applying yourself with that to one place of work at any one time. Happy to be corrected on this if people have other views though.   However, similar to what you're asking, once qualified, actuaries can earn extra on the side by marking exams or marking assignments/mocks for ActEd.  Finally, some actuaries can get into writing articles for magazines and such."

actuary,330fvh,steppe5,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:11:24 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar situation. I'm sticking with the actuarial career path to achieve early retirement. Unfortunately I didn't discover FI until my early 30's, about 2 years ago. Long story short, I have about 17 more years left of work until I can retire. Which will be earlier than most (~age 50), but I'll still have worked almost 30 years."
actuary,330fvh,toodleoo77,0,Sat Apr 18 16:20:43 2015 UTC,"Theoretically you're right. However, 10-15 years is about when your career peaks. It's hard to retire on 1.5m at 35 when you could retire with 3m at 40."
actuary,330fvh,Actuarial,5,Sat Apr 18 18:43:05 2015 UTC,It's easy when you don't need 3 million. It's easy when you value freedom over fast cars and fancy vacations.  I'd rather spend Wednesday morning in my small house with my family than driving my Mercedes to my cubicle.

It seems a little steep, but experienced actuary salaries in the US range somewhere between $150,000 and $250,000 with some making more than that.  A goal of 5 years is a little unrealistic, but perhaps not impossible given a decent salary and a solid investment strategy."

actuary,32z9ay,periAct,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:18:16 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. To me, ""Java is too verbose"" is just the canonical example of a dumb critique of a programming language. Though I can't say I've ever heard Java suggested as an alternative to VBA."
actuary,32z9ay,tf113,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:34:24 2015 UTC,"java being too verbose is one of the valid criticisms, actually but it's more that java is not a language designed for exploratory analysis. it seems to me that actuaries should be interested in languages that lend themselves well to that type of script-like programming. there are lots of script-like languages that are also very efficient, fast, well designed, etc. Java isn't a that bad a language and it looks like it's always improving but it's just so not made for exploratory data analysis."
actuary,32z9ay,periAct,0,Mon Apr 20 20:55:10 2015 UTC,"java being too verbose is one of the valid criticisms   It's not one I've ever put much stock in personally. When you're using Java to build the type of application that it's best for, having verbose, explicit code is an asset, at least to a point. Yes, it becomes more of a liability if you just want to put together a quick, simple script - but at that point, verboseness is just one item on a long list of reasons why you shouldn't be using Java.  If nothing else, the verboseness issue is overstated. It seems like every programmer who started in the last decade learned Java first, started learning Python a little bit down the road, then started bashing Java because of bad memories of having to type public static void main(String[] args) at the start of every program. Not without good reason, either - Python would be a better choice than Java for just about every program ever written in CS 101 - but the fact that Java's bad at things it's not supposed to be good at doesn't detract from it much, in my opinion.  As for the rest of your post, I couldn't agree more. The ubiquity of VBA - a language that's objectively awful but still good enough when it comes to scripting - goes a long way toward illustrating that. I'm a big fan of R (even though it's got plenty of issues of its own), and I could see it becoming hugely popular in the actuarial field if and when Revolution Analytics takes off under Microsoft."
actuary,32z9ay,tf113,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:19:30 2015 UTC,"i'd love F# to take off even more! There have been a few articles about it, in contingencies even. It does look like R's place is secure for a while and that's of course good news.  It appears to me that a lot of sophisticated programmers like the java platform and ecosystem but they're not crazy about java the language itself. The programming connoisseurs in the java world seem to be into scala and clojure and they leave raw java to the plebes."

I don't think there's much difference between 3 or 4 exams in terms of getting hired.  Some/many employers (in the US) will look at 5 exams as a negative.  Getting your GPA up to 3 will be the biggest thing you can do to help your employment chances.  You likely won't make it through most HR screenings without that.

This is why:   Getting your GPA up to 3 will be the biggest thing you can do to help your employment chances.   And that's not realistic until graduation. Even with the 3.5 I'm pulling this semester and a perfect 4.0 on some easy classes over the summer it's still unlikely to hit 3.0. I was being generous with 2.8, it's rounded up from like 2.76. I mean, I just don't know if it'd be better to apply in the fall, or wait until the spring when I have a better resume. I feel like if I apply in the fall and get rejected, companies will remember my name when I re-apply later and will reject me again."
actuary,32uh25,SixMileDrive,2,Thu Apr 16 23:47:59 2015 UTC,"Why did those people with 3+ exams not get hired? BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF EXAMS IS ONLY A PART OF THE BIG PICTURE. Getting to the first round of interviews is indeed tougher for people with less exams, but you still have a lot of time to raise your GPA (to 3.0 at least), get more experience through internships, clubs, volunteering, etc, learn excel and vba, and so much more until you start applying around September.  Last November, I was a senior with 3.05 gpa and only 1 exam passed, with no actuarial internships. But I took the time to tailor my resume/cover letter for each company after doing tons of research about the company. Then it became just a numbers game. I applied to 2~3 non-actuarial analyst/actuarial internship/full-time actuary positions at insurance/finance/consulting firms every night for 2 months straight. The proportion of invitations to first round interviews was quite low as I feared, but I applied to so many places that it worked out to enough number of positive responses to land a job offer as a product analyst at an insurance company.  You don't even necessarily have to become an actuary right out of college; preparing to become one will make you a desirable candidate for plenty of analyst positions. Although I won't be an actuary when I start working in June, I am happy that I will be doing similar type of work as a product analyst while continuing my journey to become an ASA."

Also, I took 1 VBA class back in college, but I definitely know my way around MS Access and Excel.  That being said, you know my response is biased because clearly it worked for me haha  The reason my employers were cool about it is because pretty much every firm has specialized software.  Regardless of what you know, you have to learn their system from scratch.  Inasmuch, you wont be writing code; you're just inputting parameters and letting the system run itself.  Yeah, there are jobs for actuaries who write the software, but that's not every actuary.  Knowing software language is sort of like how every established actuary's eyes glaze over when you try to discuss concepts from Exam P/1: you need to learn it just so that you can be familiar with it when it comes up, but you won't be doing the nitty gritty calculations/code writing."

Basically, just say you just found out about it and that's that.  As to applying for jobs, there are many things to consider. I personally did not know about actuarial until late senior year in college, and didn't find a job for a whole year after graduation. You need to just keep passing exams while applying to jobs. 2 is almost considered a min requirement with the competition today, so shoot for the next ones while applying for jobs.  Meanwhile, have you gotten your resume checked by your peers? If not, post it on Actuarial outpost's career section (or here, but you will get more responses there) and get a critique. Locations can be another issue-- are you geographically limiting yourself?  From your post, it seems like you are getting most if not all of your actuarial info from this subreddit.

actuary,32tsi9,aspiringactuary4,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:26:15 2015 UTC,"3.8 with a double major, well done. I'm sitting here with a 2.8 because I was a complete idiot my freshman year... Like, an idiot beyond comprehension. Almost got kicked out of school. Been solid since then but it's hard to bring up a GPA from the 1s.  I'd think that with 2 exams (assuming you're now studying for a 3rd?), a full-time job (somewhat related maybe? Business or insurance or risk related?), and a 3.8 GPA in a Business and Econ major you're at least a candidate that gets a second look, I can't imagine you having much trouble finding a job with 3 exams."
actuary,32tsi9,taooverpi,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:05:02 2015 UTC,"People, generally speaking, want to help out.  We all feel empathetic to those trying, and we want to see them succeed.  Here's my story:  Networking, for me, turned out to be a great avenue to getting a foot in the door.  I went from having a small network, 1 exam, and no offers and then I started reaching out and probing.  I got a few interviews which turned into a larger network.    I passed 1 more exam, had a few more interviews (with some of the people in my network), and kept all my connections up to date.  Within 1 week (just last week) I received two offers from one company (different teams) and a third offer from a different company--almost entirely due to networking.  I wouldn't have thought that simple/brief conversations with people who had ""made it to the promised land"" would pay such dividends.  Reach out, reach up--especially to those in your area and offer to treat them to insert beverage here (oftentimes those with the job you're seeking will pay anyway), and listen to their stories.  They will inquire about you, and be honest.  Let them know you're looking for work.  Ask them what skills you should improve upon.  Remember them, and follow up.   It only takes 1 connection to lead to an offer.  Do yourself the favor, and get acquainted with more than 1 actuary.  Once enough people see that you're willing to put in the time to do whatever it takes to get through the exams/networking, one of them is bound to have an opening nearby.  Make sure you're ready for the door when it opens; in this market, doors don't stay open for long."
actuary,32t8cy,OopsNoBullets,2,Thu Apr 16 15:04:54 2015 UTC,Already? Damn. I'm only about halfway done with the material (had to stop for a little because schools getting busy). Hopefully 3 months is enough time

actuary,32t8cy,Boogertits,2,Thu Apr 16 17:25:16 2015 UTC,If you're using ASM make sure you budget a lot of time for the last 5 chapters. They're much harder than the first 20.

actuary,32t8cy,Boogertits,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:20:10 2015 UTC,I didn't find TIA to be great. It leaves out detail on numerous sections. I would recommend going through ASM and then do ADAPT practice exams.

actuary,32tb1a,the_dann,2,Thu Apr 16 15:24:36 2015 UTC,"I was an intern working in an accident and health department at a p&c firm.  To my knowledge, the company would only pay for the CAS path, or at least that is what it seemed liked. Everyone on the team was going down that path. Only one manager was a FSA, and was one for a while (before getting there).   Where are you on your exams? If you not up to uppers, take the joint exams and make a final decision in a year or two.  What lines of business have you worked in?  Do you have any preference when you were looking?   Your manager and coworkers can help make a more informed decision"
actuary,32tb1a,shermderm,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:52:06 2015 UTC,"I've taken P and FM and am studying for MFE currently, likely C next as your advice suggests. That's promising about the CAS path as my preference is to be on the P&C side, although that being said this is my first actuarial position, so I don't have any first hand experience in any areas."
actuary,32tb1a,shermderm,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:02:19 2015 UTC,"Like you said, take MFE then C.  At that point you should be able to make a decision.  If you are still unsure reach out to an actuary at a health firm, and see if they are willing to speak to you"
actuary,32t5yb,cowboomboom,5,Thu Apr 16 14:46:27 2015 UTC,"Shout out to a fellow longhorn! Basically, you choice comes out to your money needs. Do you need money right now? If so, then get an analyst job or entry level insurance job (Underwriter, Claims Adjuster), pass exams on your own, and do either an internal transfer to the actuarial department or apply to other companies. Which is what I did and I had no problems getting interviews with 3 exams and 1 year experience as a claim adjuster even though my GPA is on the low end. I will be starting my first actuarial job next month.   If money is not an immediate concern and you don't mind paying or borrowing the other 50% for grad school, getting the master degree is a good plan. The master program is pretty much the same as undergrad at UT and plenty of company come to recruit on campus. Just off the top of my head, the Big 4, AIG, State Farm, Allstate, Liberty, USAA (which LOVES former military), Towers, Cigna, etc. The fall career fair usually has 10 to 15 companies looking for actuarial students and the spring career fair has about 5 to 10. (Although you can still go to those careers fairs as an alumni). So pass at least one exam in your first year and that's enough to get your a summer internship. Master degree from UT, 2 exams, and an internship = guaranteed full time offer.   So MA in AS is definitely easier way to get your foot into the door because it gives you more access to networking opportunities, career services, and internships. So unless you do horribly and keep on failing exams, you will most likely end up with a good job. However, you got to pay for it and it takes 2 years. Working while taking exams is less certain and studying for exams on top of working a full time job sucks. I had no social life for like 5 month straight and I almost quit after falling the first time. (Took me 4 attempts to pass 3 exams during a 5 month period).  Also, know that you want to be an actuary before going down the Master degree route cuz MA in AS is not good for anything but AS. If you want to do other stuff, I recommend getting a MBA from McCombs. Your GPA is on the low end but as long as you explain it out in your essays and get a high GMAT, getting in is possible cuz admissions love former military types. (I did UG at McCombs and was a temp in the admissions office for a semester.)   Good Luck!"
actuary,32t5yb,cowboomboom,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:45:01 2015 UTC,"This is incredibly helpful. I was actually an undergraduate learning assistant for calculus classes at UT, so I'm hoping that will help my chances of getting accepted.  It seems that sometimes students are admitted to the MA in AS program with funding each semester as Teaching Assistants. Maybe that's something worth looking into... although yeah I'm worried a lot about my GPA."
actuary,32rohj,adrianmendez16,9,Thu Apr 16 04:06:37 2015 UTC,I'm studying for MFE too. I recommend ASM manual with a whole lot of ADAPT practice exams from what my peers have told me. Good luck
actuary,32rohj,2g2h,3,Thu Apr 16 04:16:19 2015 UTC,+1  I used both ASM + ADAPT and was more than prepared for MFE
actuary,32rohj,ActuarialGrape,2,Thu Apr 16 04:52:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestions! I will get the ASM and will most likely get the exams too.   Good luck to you too.
actuary,32rohj,ksutton92,2,Thu Apr 16 05:08:47 2015 UTC,Agree. Used ASM for material (no practice exams) and then did a month of practice exams through ADAPT.

For MFE, I did ASM manual and followed it up with ADAPT practice exams.  I ended up having a month for practice exams, which looking back was too long for me.  I was going crazy near the end.  I'd suggest maybe 3 weeks tops, but obviously that's open to preference."

I prefer to give my old materials to people in your situation, since once people have a paying gig the company usually takes care of it.  Plus everyone I know is well past MFE.  You're right that you're going to have to be more selective about your purchases from this point on.  I personally believe ASM is the best, and from my colleagues it seems to have the best track record.  I also have some actuarial brew tests which I found very helpful as well.  Feel free to email me at robfindlan@gmail.com"
actuary,32rohj,spartanburt,2,Sun Apr 19 18:35:33 2015 UTC,"Ok I read through the whole thread and I'd second most of the opinions on here.  Likely the reason people are recommending skipping the ASM practice exams is because they overshoot the difficulty.  But the also start out easier and get progressively harder; doing the first 2, maybe 3 at the most might still be worthwhile, if you have the time.  The brew exams I mentioned are closer to the difficulty of the real thing.  ADAPT is also worth every penny."

I'm pretty confident you have 0 chance to get a job in the UK with 0 experience and 1 exam (SOA too, not the UK version). There's lots of ppl struggling to get an entry level job in the UK as well, so I doubt they would hire internationally.

actuary,32renn,shizzler,2,Thu Apr 16 03:54:14 2015 UTC,"Most entry level jobs won't ask for exams. The ""nearly qualified"" positions are usually looking for a couple of years of experience. In the UK, people generally don't start the exams until they already have their first job (and employers don't expect them to have started before getting the job!)"
actuary,32renn,shizzler,1 point,Thu Apr 16 09:23:12 2015 UTC,Thats rather interesting to know and I didnt know that!  Over here you won't ever be considered for an interview without passing the first exam. Coming in with 2 passed is even better so I've been told.  Some places (here in the USA as far as I can tell) will set aside hours for you to study should you want to take more exams while employed.  So how do graduates get work experience without taking any exams prior to employment in the UK?
actuary,32renn,shizzler,1 point,Thu Apr 16 11:57:15 2015 UTC,"Yes there does seem to be a different view in both countries. I've never met anybody who did any exams before getting a job, but some people do get exemptions from certain exams if they have covered the material to a reasonable standard at university.  We can apply for summer internships similar to the USA, but the majority of entry level applicants don't have one! For a lot of people, the job will be their first (although any work experience, even unrelated to actuarial, is seen as a positive)  We also get study days (I get 52 days per year to use, in addition to my holidays).  I wrote an FAQ on the UK system, but I don't know much about foreign applicants and how they are viewed unfortunately!  https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/2xggcb/uk_actuarial_exams_faq/"
actuary,32renn,allofthethings,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:16:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for explaining how acturial students work over there!  It's surprising to know all that now because as I mentioned in my comment before that here in the USA you are only taken seriously for any acturial job if you have any exams under your belt, usually related to the position of hire.   Exams have a ton of merit here it seems as far as entry level goes.  For example, ive been told that if you have at least 2-3 exams done when applying for any sort of position, you're taken very seriously.  From my university ive been told that most people usually take courses to prep them for the P and FM exam taken before graduating, which is what Im doing.   So with all that said, how are exams viewed in terms of merit in the UK? And what are acturial interns called over there?  To my knowledge most starting actuaries are called analysts or assistant analysts here."

actuary,32p8xt,smthsmth,1 point,Sat Apr 18 03:54:23 2015 UTC,"... ok, another way to think about it is:  you know it is a pdf, and the integral over both variables must be 1. you also know that X doesn't depend on Y, so you can make that integral the ""inside"" one, and make the outside one integrate over Y. X doesn't depend on Y, so it's marginal is just some constant, call it c. Now you know the pdf of Y is c, over the given range (0,3x2) which you can recognize as the uniform pdf."

However, if you're willing to take a few more courses after you graduate, accounting would be good because, like you said in some other comment, it's required for a finance class. Corporate finance is required for getting the VEEs done, which is required for some things I believe. I'm in my second accounting class. Accounting is really easy if your a math major. It's not that boring if you have an okay professor.  Computer science would be good if you either A) just wanted to take a class that you'd enjoy or B) planned on taking more computer science classes. The programming knowledge you get from CS 1 is pretty minimal (source: CS AP exam) compared to what you actually would want to know in the field. Then again, it would be better to say you took a computer science class or have programming experience in a math-related job application than to not say that.  My vote would be: take computer science and if you really do want to be an actuary take your VEEs at night school or community college in your spare time."

actuary,32iafd,hello61,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:31:13 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with the other posters and recommend the accounting class. For some actuarial roles (such as financial reporting), accounting is essential. While accounting is easy to learn, and you can always learn it on the job, you'll have an easier time getting used to such a role if you already know accounting. In contrast, while programming is important for actuaries, Java isn't - VBA/SQL/SAS is. If you could take a course in one of those languages, I would recommend it over the accounting class, but between Java and accounting, I recommend accounting (especially since you already have some programming experience)."

actuary,32g1x4,MuffinMopper,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:06:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this is ever used in practice, but here is an example which comes to mind (similar to ABACADABRA problem):  Suppose that there is a chemical factory.  This factory has a safety procedure in place, but in the event that several independent events happen in succession, the factory will explode and cause a huge loss.  An example of this would be forgetting to add solvent on day 1, forgetting to regulate the temperature on day 2, and then forgetting to notice a problem in the control room on day 3, causing an explosion.  An insurer wants to calculate the loss of this happening.  Suppose that there are 5 events that must happen in succession, ABABA.  If ABABC happens, there will be no disaster.    The insurer knows the probability of each event during each sequence of time, but wants to know the expected amount of time until ABABA occurs.  We can define this as martingale.  Each day, the person bets 1 dollar.  If A comes up, they win 1/P(A), otherwise they win nothing.  If they win, they bet all their winnings on B the next day, and win they will have 1/P(A)*1/P(B) dollars.  They will then bet it all on a A the next day, ect.  The person keeps betting till they get ABABA or lose it all.  This process will stop when ABABA first occurs.  We know that at this time, the expected value of all bets will be 0, since it is a martingale process with fair betting.    The total revenue for a casino will be n, and the total expenses for the casino will be 1/P(ABABA)+1/P(ABA) + 1/P(A).  Now we solve the equation, E(value of bets) = 0 = 1/P(ABABA)+1/P(ABA) + 1/P(A) -n.  Solving for this we find n = 1/P(ABABA)+1/P(ABA) + 1/P(A)."

That being said, I wouldn't recommend getting a masters in data science for the same reason why I wouldn't recommend a masters in actuarial science. I'm of the opinion that it's a marketing stunt and overly expensive. You're better off with a more traditional masters in CS or Stats."
actuary,32ec6y,BuhlmannStraub,6,Mon Apr 13 02:23:15 2015 UTC,"In the P&C world Towers Watson has quite the monopoly for most needs when it comes to specialized software like Emblem (GLMs), Radar (Rating Algorithms) and ResQ (Reserving). However one area that is extremely competitive is Machine Learning methods applied to insurance pricing, the reason for this is that no one really knows exactly what they are doing when it comes to Machine Learning techniques, it's not a standard like GLMs and because of this there are a lot of companies that are trying to excel in this field.  I work in the R&D department of a relatively large insurance firm and while we always look at what other specialized software companies offer... We try to see what we can do in house with tools we already have like R (R is sadly an extremely underused software in the insurance world). This way we can explore our own methods and even develop full fledged tools. However once our needs expand past our knowledge or what we have time for we move on to external consultants and software firms."
actuary,32ec6y,BuhlmannStraub,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:12:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed reply! I'll look into these tools for sure. I'm not surprised machine learning is such a valuable tool in your field. I imagine every company in the industry is knee-deep in data, trying to develop tools to map and derive meaningful conjectures from it all the time. Machine learning is a fascinating and lucrative field as it is, and you guys (actuaries) do some really cool work that lends itself exceptionally well to it. I definitely think it would be worth my time to seek out an affiliated project!    I don't quite have the the skills yet, neither mathematically nor in CS, but that's definitely where I'll be very soon. Would you recommend seeking out some sort of internship with an insurance company with the goal of trying to identify where their software needs lie in practical application? Do you think they'd even want to have me around if my reasons for being there were self-serving with little interest of seeking employment?"
actuary,32ec6y,colonelsmoothie,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:10:40 2015 UTC,"There are two parts to this, one part is that a lot of companies will deal with these problems through consultants because its cheaper than hiring specialized people. The other thing is that companies that would hire someone for these tasks would be very wary of hiring an intern that would have no intention of staying mostly because they wouldn't want someone going company to company spreading their secrets.  With that said, go for it and see what happens."
actuary,32ec6y,ShakeNBakes,2,Mon Apr 13 15:43:13 2015 UTC,"Also, big firms like Towers Watson buy out smaller startups. For example, EMB and Pretium were two companies acquired by TW. That's how TW ended up with Emblem and Pretium in their product list. So if you're looking to get into actuarial software dev, consider a startup if you're willing to take the risk."

Also the level of specialization needed for actuarial software is very high, meaning it might be challenging to develop just one piece of general software.  I think your best bet to develop actuarial software would to get a position where you would work on existing software so you could identify any shortcomings and then create a solution yourself."
actuary,32fsaf,ChalkSticks,6,Mon Apr 13 13:14:49 2015 UTC,Yes. The PV functions are invaluable for FM. Bring both calculators and use the BA for financial stuff and the multiview for other stuff.
actuary,32fsaf,TrueBlonde,4,Mon Apr 13 13:25:37 2015 UTC,"Use the BA II for TVM, and use the 30XS for everything else."

At some point (I can remember where exactly) I got to problems where finding the present value (or future value or payment, whatever) was just a small part of the problem, and BAII helped immensely in speeding up my work on those problems.  Also, have you gotten to linear interpolation to find i?  I'm sure at this point you'll reconsider using the BAII.  You can bring both.  I, like many others, used the multiview for most of the exam and the BAII for just the annuity  and TVM problems."

The article mentions participant apathy, but really I think its unreasonable to expect people to be husbands, wives, dads, coworkers ect. and also be able to understand AND do something about a poor 401k fund. Not to mention a 401k is something people rarely think about, its challenging enough for most to plan for child's 4 year college tuition, let alone retirement which can be decades away.   On top of all this, employees are at the mercy of whatever fund their employer chooses, so if you only have 15 fund options ranging rom .8-1.8%, is the fee disclosure intended to make you look for another job?  tldr: fee disclosure is adding another unreasonably complex personal financial decision on the employee, to solve the problems fee disclosure intended to, treat the systemic causes of exorbitant 401k fees."
actuary,326m5y,SalmonHatchery,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:58:18 2015 UTC,How does fee disclosure add another decision? Doesn't it just highlight a decision people haven't been paying attention to?

actuary,3261bo,CD_Johanna,3,Fri Apr 10 21:46:35 2015 UTC,"Sure, we integrate by parts:  [;a+\int_{a}^{\infty}[1-F(x)]dx=a+[x(1-F(x))]_{a}^{\infty}+\int_{a}^{\infty}xf(x)dx = \int_{a}^{\infty}xf(x)dx;].  The ""infinity"" term in brackets vanishes by definition of F, the other term cancels with the a."

actuary,3261bo,MateoAngelo,2,Fri Apr 10 22:08:55 2015 UTC,"Forget looking at a proof, just draw the picture. The last integral from 0 to infinity is shown as the shaded area in the picture below. Now, imagine estimating the shaded area using horizontal rectangles, where we don't allow the value of x to vary from the width of the rectangle by more than a given amount. Then, the width of the rectangle will be x, and the height will be inversely proportional to the slope of F inverse of x, i.e., proportional to the slope of F(x). So then our integral is basically just xf(x), which is the same as the integral we use to define E[x].  If you're familiar with the Lebesgue integral that's what I'm describing doing.  http://imgur.com/VyPKqNv"

actuary,3236xf,aevyn,1 point,Fri Apr 10 05:11:33 2015 UTC,Thank you! This is the answer I was looking for. I do believe I'll be going the actuarial route. And I don't mind product development or valuation as I have taken some classes involving the topics.
actuary,3236xf,ActuariallyInclined,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:52:48 2015 UTC,ERM (enterprise risk management) would probably interest you. There are currently a lot of actuaries working in that area and it's growing.
actuary,3236xf,blueCALC,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:56:46 2015 UTC,CFA is the way to go if you want to do portfolio management
actuary,3236xf,blueCALC,1 point,Sat Apr 11 19:39:28 2015 UTC,Which is what I figured but if I wanted to go into the risk management aspect would it benefit me at all? I have taken a few statistics classes as well as econometrics and economic linear algebra and enjoyed them thoroughly. I just didn't want to be a stats major. I do however feel like I'd like the work that I'd get as a result of doing the QFI/CFE tracks.
actuary,3236xf,TrueBlonde,2,Fri Apr 10 07:20:08 2015 UTC,"there is risk management involved in both in the work a CFA and FSA does. But as you said in your thread, your focus is mainly finance related. In that industry, the actuarial designation kinda means squat. Also, there's no guarantee you'll work in finance as an actuary which is why I recommend the CFA route."
actuary,3236xf,blueCALC,1 point,Fri Apr 10 09:44:44 2015 UTC,An FSA is really only good for being an actuary. The amount of work isn't worth it unless you're staying in actuarial.

actuary,3236xf,getonmyhype,3,Fri Apr 10 16:42:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like that's an extreme comparison. Also, how does anyone in college know what they want to do without actually doing it and just studying it? Obviously I looked into actuarial science and found myself interested by it. I've always known that I wanted to work with finance and risk and felt like being an actuary would fulfill that desire. It's not like I decided to be an actuary on a whim."

actuary,322v6g,sooneroo,7,Fri Apr 10 03:17:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty much exact same thing happened to me except my interviewer actually came and got me (not sure which is worse. Having them wait or them coming to get you). She mentioned I was in the wrong building, I apologized and she said it was fine. I ended up getting the job so either it didn't matter or I was such an outstanding candidate that they hired me in spite of the faux pas. I'm going to guess it was the former.   My bet is that in situations where there are two buildings or something along those lines it probably happens fairly often. If the hiring people were really bothered by it, they would instruct their front desk people to make sure the interviewer is in the right place, or be more clear to begin with."
actuary,322v6g,jebuz23,3,Fri Apr 10 04:28:58 2015 UTC,Was this at Chubb? Same thing almost happened to me. But I doubt this is the reason it cost you the internship. It's not your fault the receptionist gave you a wrong impression.

However, I received the email denying me only a few days later. It didn't feel too good lol.  I also ended up getting a position elsewhere, so it's not all too bad I suppose. This incident was just something I've wanted to ask someone for a while now."
actuary,322v6g,crastle,1 point,Fri Apr 10 05:01:12 2015 UTC,"Obviously I don't know why this specific organization turned you down, but if I was looking at hiring you this wouldn't affect the decision. I would actually go ask the front desk person why they let you sit in the wrong building after paging the person you were to meet."
actuary,322v6g,ActuariallyInclined,1 point,Fri Apr 10 14:39:11 2015 UTC,"If it did cost you the job, it doesn't sound like the best job to have.  Think about it, if choosing wrong in a 50-50 chance is frowned upon so much, then imagine how they would react when you make a tiny mistake (which is definitely going to happen).  Edit: There could be a million different reasons why they didn't hire you.  It might honestly have nothing to do with you.  I have personally seen companies not hire the best candidates for whatever reason.  It's like dating.  You might be rejected even though you did nothing wrong."
actuary,322v6g,redditleopard,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:36:44 2015 UTC,I doubt it. I did a similar thing when I was interviewing in the fall. I drove to the data center by mistake after lunch a with someone from the company. I was pretty late but still got an offer afterwards. If a company rejects for a stupid mistake like that they're probably not one you want to work for.
actuary,322v6g,colonelsmoothie,1 point,Sat Apr 11 19:45:45 2015 UTC,"It may have hurt you but probably didn't cost you the job.  If you were the best candidate they would have thought slightly longer but then offered you the job; if not they may have tossed you out a little faster than they would have otherwise.  Also, if you interviewed with multiple people only the first one would have cared."
actuary,322v6g,jebuz23,-4,Fri Apr 10 13:47:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe. If the competition was so tight that the only thing separating you and the other candidates was that 15 minute mishap. In reality the person they took was probably more qualified either because they had more exams or better work experience, etc.  You need to make yourself so far ahead of the competition (4.0 Princeton math with 5 exams and 3 internships) that minor errors won't hurt you. Remember, Jackie Robinson wasn't just an okay baseball player. He was so good that it would be a crime not to take him, not matter what race he was."
actuary,322v6g,anotheralt88,3,Fri Apr 10 03:51:45 2015 UTC,"I agree, this shouldn't be downvoted, it's actually pretty decent advice.  People try to pick apart why they weren't hired think of the craziest reasons (omg I wore blue tie and my interviewer had red tie, am I fucked?!) instead of  reflecting on the real reasons.  I guess it's easier to say ""Well that was some bullshit, I couldn't even control that"" than ""Well I suck a little bit, I better get better"".  Jobs go to well qualified people that interview well.  As colonelsmoothie suggested, anything could affect a decision, but only after all the 'normal' factors have been passed over."
actuary,322v6g,inputnamehere,2,Fri Apr 10 17:17:50 2015 UTC,why would this be downvoted? Sounds about right to me.

actuary,322v6g,anotheralt88,1 point,Fri Apr 10 12:00:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Most of the time for EL, the top candidate simply has more exams and a better GPA than everyone else, unless they were so socially inept as to be unhireable. However, these kids tend to not be socially inept. I'm not saying you really need to have a 4.0 from Princeton with 5 exams. I certainly didn't have that when I got hired. But if you did, you'd get hired without any trouble. Even if you were 15 minutes late to the interview. Just saying."
actuary,321l9v,manifolded,7,Thu Apr 9 21:05:48 2015 UTC,"The thing is your background doesn't lend itself towards the exams really. Obviously your a smart guy but you'll still have to put in time studying for FM and MFE similarly to someone without a phD level background. You can pass the first two exams, doable in like 3 months for someone on your level, and then see what happens. I guess apply for EL jobs.   My question to you is why do you want to be an actuary. Seems like you already have the credentials to be a formidable quant, why don't you go that route. Or data analytics/mining. I feel like a lot of actuaries chose the exam route over higher education because that was their best option at the time. You have plenty of higher education and now want to revert back to the start of the exam track. In effect all your hard work would be reduced to a slightly higher EL salary. Why not wrap up the degree and get a job at a bank that pays more than most actuaries could make without an FCAS.   You talk about programming but most actuaries are programming stuff in SQL or VBA that is used day to day (Some used R and SAS and I would like to use that one day as well). Nobody is coding any actual software with innovative languages or techniques. So most of your knowledge would be extra compared to the job at hand particularly in the beginning stages.   Just looking at the situation objectively. Since this is an actuarial forum everyone will encourage you to do it and enter the profession anyways. I am an actuarial student also so I am speaking with some perspective here. an actuary is a good career but I wonder why you don't shoot for something more geared towards the skills you already have. Especially since you are in NYC where there are a million opportunities around."
actuary,321l9v,sozzZ,2,Thu Apr 9 22:37:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input!    The thing is your background doesn't lend itself towards the exams really.   Oh for sure, I don't think that my studying theoretical math will help me with the material - rather, I think that having to study for qualifying exams in advanced material is a good comparison to having to study for tough exams in actuarial science . Thought being, if I could do it for theoretical math, I could do it for actuarial math too, if I put in the work.   I think the issue with being a quant is how unappealing the work-hours seem. It sounds to me like actuaries can work 50 hour weeks and make somewhere in the 100-200k while in their late 40s. I've also gotten the impression that with enough experience and exams passed, that this is more than possible. That sounds a lot nicer than a 60-70 hour week as a quant! Not sure if that's exactly true, but it's definitely the impression I've gotten.   I think I'd prefer not to wrap up the degree as I'm not entirely sure it's a smart financial move - it'll take me at least 3 more years (maybe more) to finish my PhD, and based on what I've seen on job postings for NYC, it's not even clear that there's a significant benefit to having a PhD. If that's the case, might as well drop out now and start working - 3 years of experience over a PhD that may not be valuable, in summary."
actuary,321l9v,bkberry352,3,Thu Apr 9 23:13:01 2015 UTC,Have you considered data science type positions? With your background (programming and math) you could be pretty competitive. I've found machine learning to keep me interested from a theoretical perspective. Starting salaries (without having to take exams) can certainly be higher than actuarial (not sure about mid-career though).
actuary,321l9v,casact921,3,Thu Apr 9 23:40:30 2015 UTC,"Thought being, if I could do it for theoretical math, I could do it for actuarial math too, if I put in the work.   I was ABD in a math PhD program (passed quals, coursework, candidacy exams, everything but dissertation) and left for actuarial work. I'm currently struggling through the actuarial exams. It's two completely different skill sets. In grad school, all that matters is that you grasp the concepts. Yeah the quals are timed - probably 6-10 intro grad problems in algebra or analysis or topology in 3hrs or something like that - but they're not trying to ding you on time, they just want to you demonstrate you have the breadth of knowledge necessary to start in the program. In actuarial exams, everybody grasps all the concepts - it's not rocket science. So, instead, the exams test for speed. It's a dead sprint through the material. Break-neck speed, no slip-ups. If grad school is a marathon, actuarial exams are a 5K, but you don't pass unless you're in the top 30% of the contenders. And half the field is runnin a sub 18min 5k, easy.  So, not to try and freak you out, just wanted to give you a heads up. I know of two math PhDs in our company off the top of my head who started off in actuarial and bombed out of the exam program. And it's not cause they're dumb (they're not) or because actuaries are soo much smarter (we're not) but because they spent 6 years in grad school training their minds to be slow, methodical theorem proving machines. No part of that training helps w/ actuarial exams."
actuary,321l9v,Vengoropatubus,2,Fri Apr 10 04:22:31 2015 UTC,"Depending on your willingness to relocate and work for an unprestigious firm, you could probably get a job this summer. If you want your pick of jobs, pass Exams P and FM this summer and fall and interview next fall. You'll definitely get offers north of $50,000   eh, i'm married and live virtually rent-free in my great-grandparents house in Queens. My wife works/goes to school here, so relocating is unfortunately not an option. Maybe I'll do research for my doctorate program and try to take both exams this summer - Thanks!"
actuary,321l9v,vVvTime,2,Thu Apr 9 21:18:37 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar position I think. I was in a PhD program that I figured out wasn't right for me. I had a healthy amount of programming background, and a math undergrad. I left grad school without a master's degree, then studied for and passed P and FM.   I applied to a few positions after I passed P, and didn't hear anything back. I failed my first attempt at FM because I didn't study for the right things, but I did a better job studying for the next date and passed.   It wound up too much time to get myself out there with two exams though, and I accepted a position with an insurance company in a programming capacity.   In my job search, there were a lot more companies that were interested in programming ability than a 2 exam actuary. If I'd waited longer, I probably could've found an offer, but I had four offers in hand before anyone got back to me for an interview about an actuary job.   That said, the actuary exams gave me a good explanation for what I did with my time out of work. No one was terribly bothered by the fact that I left grad school, which makes sense because a lot of people are leaving grad school."
actuary,321l9v,vVvTime,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:16:04 2015 UTC,"I was in a pure Math PhD program for a little over 1 year (decided about 6 months in to just get the masters and leave, wasn't in love with it) before I became an actuary. I took exam P in May, finished school in August, took exam FM in October, didn't start a job until the next February. I had a very similar background with respect to REUs and such, although I didn't get any papers published.  I think you should probably do it a little less rashly than I did, although it's probably a lot easier to find a job in this economy than when I was looking for a job. With your background you can probably pass exam P without really studying (I'd say 10-15 hours just in case). Exam FM you'll probably need to at least buy a manual, and study like 40 hours.  At least in my experience, it's somewhat hard to get an interview with an atypical background, but once you get an interview it's very easy to get offers. I think the math background is very helpful for actuaries, because aside from obviously being good at math, being good at proof-writing translates very well into the sort of written explanations you'll have to give as an actuary.  Also, forget about making 100k-200k in your late 40s... you'll be making 100k after like 3 years assuming you don't fail your exams. Sure as hell beats academia, where you get to work 60+ hour weeks and make 30k in a postdoc when you're 33."

Currently, I am memorizing all the formulas again. Most I know rather well and am focusing on some of the rare ones involving increasing/decreasing contracts, double force of interest contracts, contracts with interest set to 0, and cases when the force of interest or mortality is altered. Earlier today I did all the SOA MC sample problems that I've missed multiple times, about 20, and next I plan to go through the written exams problems I've missed, about 30 between the SOA prior exams, the SOA sample, and the Coaching Actuaries written exams. Does anyone have the TIA practice exams and solutions they may be willing to leave somewhere online for me?

I feel really ready; Through 3 ADAPT exams I'm around 7.5 EL, and I got about 90% of the SOA 309 right, so it's just coasting into the exam at this point.

actuary,31ybuj,Vengoropatubus,2,Thu Apr 9 16:39:14 2015 UTC,"I almost didn't check your link before linking you to that exact article. Glad I looked!   You convinced yourself that the mean of the average is the mean, probably by saying average = sum/N, then E(average) = E(sum)/N = N*E(single)/N.   Then, using the fact that Var(a * x) =a2 * Var(x), and the fact that var(sum) =sum(var), we can say Var(average) =Var(sum/n) =Var(sum) /n2 =n*Var(single) /n2 =Var(single)/n, so s.d.=sqrt(var) =s.d.(single)/sqrt(n)"

actuary,31ybuj,jebuz23,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:39:51 2015 UTC,"Another way of looking at it is that they are asking about a population average, using a random sample.  This makes it an inference procedure.  Since there is more inherent ""error"" to the measurement than would be present for a completely known group, we use DeMoivre's equation  s.d/sqrt(n).    I know there's a few others where they simply ask the probability of a group n.  When they ask for the ""average of n randomly selected individuals"", you should think inference."

If you do fine on the math stuff because you LIKE that stuff more, and don't like the finance stuff, you should think hard about whether being an actuary is right for you."

If I felt like I had any chance of getting it right, I answered it. Otherwise, I obviously left it blank.  I answered every question on LC because with only 15 questions you are starting to play with fire by leaving some blank. I suppose if you have absolutely no idea you should leave one blank but it isn't recommended.  EDIT: I used the ASM manual for both, so I can't speak to the difficulty of ADAPT or TIA. I found that the real deal was significantly easier than any practice exam in ASM."

actuary,31u7r9,trapperjustin,2,Wed Apr 8 10:27:37 2015 UTC,You may be tired of hearing it but I know tons of people with exams who are having trouble finding internships. I represented my company at a career fair and we got over 100 resumes and I would say 90% had at least one exam. It took me almost 2 years to find an internship and I had an exam and a high GPA. Once you have experience it is much much easier to get another internship. But your advice is helpful and it never hurts to apply.

Depending on what programming they want. Typically VBA is the best all around skill to know. Cover letter should not be a summary of your resume or rehash it. Pointless redundancy. P and FM are basically joke exams compares to the rest. Even 2-3 years ago having only exam P is not enough for an internship anymore, and this was at a school with an actuarial science program and a pretty good campus recruiting scene."

actuary,31slj2,SirIssacMath,-1,Wed Apr 8 04:38:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know. Kinda sucks. I'm going to join the Actuarial Club and try to network this summer, but I don't have many connections. I know, but I'm applying to recently added positions. Yeah, this is probably a big one. My GPA is low because of a horrifyingly bad freshman year GPA, so despite the fact that my GPA since then has been 3.2-3.3ish, I can't put my GPA on my resume so I just leave it off. True, but I still have demonstrated that I can pick up any language quickly. It's not. I know they are. I passed P with flying colors. If I don't have an internship this summer I'll be doing FM and MFE."
actuary,31slj2,jonkl91,7,Wed Apr 8 02:18:21 2015 UTC,The GPA may be why. You say that since your bad year your GPA is at 3.2 to 3.3. That isn't too good. Also a lot of times when you leave your GPA off the resume it is automatically assumed it is bad and your resume is thrown away. Not saying it's bad but I represented my company at a career fair and there are so many resumes that we have to find some easy way to filter them out. Your resume is probably getting filtered out for whatever reason. There are just so many resumes that are impressive that it really is hard to decide which one to interview. You seem like a bright kid. What sport were you a national champ in? That would be enough for me to pick up resume (I don't do that at my company). Network and you will get someone's interest who can give you a referral. I applied for internships for like 2 years before I got one. Only 2 companies called me back. One of them I was not qualified for because they required coding knowledge and I had very little. I aced the other interview and was offered an internship and I am currently working full time. Someone told me that you don't need 100s of job. You only need one. So keep applying and networking until you find that one. Also it may be your resume format. I have seen some horrendous formats. Also what pops up when your name is searched online?
actuary,31slj2,PassionVoid,3,Wed Apr 8 02:25:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice. I know my GPA isn't great and it haunts me every day. I may be able to get my major-only GPA up above 3.5 by the time I graduate... But then again, I'd be applying to jobs in May when most were filled by January.  I don't want to say my sport, because I like to remain anonymous and it's a sport where you could pretty easily figure out who I am IMO. But I have also been networking, contacting friends who know actuaries, et cetera.  As far as my resume, I'm having my actuarial science advisor help me with it. The format is good, although one of the first things he pointed out was ""you left your GPA off, was that on purpose?"" so I'm sure everyone else notices that. He also told me that they may wonder why I am interested in actuarial science when 3/4 of my ""experience"" listings are as a developer, working with code.  In terms of searching my name, nothing incriminating. Twitter page, facebook page, and some development work I've done."

actuary,31slj2,the_dann,3,Tue Apr 7 22:29:59 2015 UTC,Nailed it. I leave it off my resume because it's in the 2s.
actuary,31slj2,the_dann,3,Wed Apr 8 02:19:08 2015 UTC,"They may have already found someone. Assuming there's nothing seriously wrong with your application you likely just need to increase the number of applications you're sending out.  Another piece of wisdom I've learned is you really want to try and be different from the other applicants, whether that is through your actual application or the method you apply. If you think what you're doing is what the typical applicant is doing then it's probably going to take a while to find a spot."

I also have some other things which make me stand out (so I thought) such as a national championship in my sport. But perhaps they just already found someone.  I also am sending out as many as I can, but for each one I'm trying to write a nice cover letter pertinent to the job and make sure my resume objective fits the description well so it can take 30 mins for each one."
