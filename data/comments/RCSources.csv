Also why not release this new scamming site. Some ppl said that there was a virus behind the adress that was named for the new shop.   Maybe max. 80-100 new customers registered on their temp store because of the sample thing. Some of them could have used the same password that they use on other pages/shops so gathered data would be worth... hm.. likely nothing? Who wants to go through all the pages and try to login with the gathered data? Same with adress. Its no problem to find this info on google nowdays and if it's the same person that was behind gaga he already had good amount of data from these times, i guess. Also in their temporary shop there was no payment option available where you actually had to give them important info. Some ppl even got their products (not free samples) but someone on this subreddit even reported it was ""on the way"" for about 3 weeks. And if I remember correctly they also shipped from EU...  I beleve him. He has too much problems because of that customer that ripped him via paypal and just invested everthing he had left to get a new shop going to compensate the loss. Customs could have sized a lot of our samples and checked the 2-cb-fly and found another substance that was actually sheduled in his country...its likely considering the reports of the fake product. Maybe a lab also scammed him and he was in a hurry and didnt want to invest more money/time to get an own gc/ms tests of all compounds..."

I know it goes against the grain for this sub, but RC's are only legal to but without the intent of consumption. If they decide to investigate your package (which happens) get a warrant for your location (which they can do) and find that any of these chemicals are being used in any illicit way other than scientific data... you will be prosecuted.   This doesn't mean don't go through with your ventures it just means don't use anything personal to you. The most personal information you should use is your address for shipping if that. When using your address it should be encrypted or at the very least ran through a simple encryption type self destructing platform.   Other than that USE bitcoin. Even if it is the most simplest version of bitcoin... QPAY'S LibertyX. You can find it all over in Cali. No ID needed, no bank info. Just cash to bitcoin immediately. For free.   As far as available psychedelics.

RCSources,3duskq,katza601,4,Sun Jul 19 18:04:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the review, bro!  I'm glad you liked the stealth.  :) haha  To get the residue from the bag, a simple alcohol wash will get it out and all you need to do is dry it out at room temperature.  5-meo-mipt is a relatively stable compound, so little if any degradation will happen.  That said, I'll get smaller baggies just to make it easier.  Thanks for the suggestion!  I haven't tried vaporizing it.  How did that go?  What sort of vaporization unit and temp did you use and how much material?  Did you convert it to a freebase first?  Sorry for the million questions, just really curious about this!"
RCSources,3duskq,Golden-Era,2,Sun Jul 19 19:32:45 2015 UTC,I've vaporized the hydrochloride before with great success. I just loaded 25 mg into a Vapor Genie and consumed it all in one draw and held it in. I blasted off into a overwhelming emotional-lability state. It was dope.
RCSources,3duskq,blackmortem,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:58:01 2015 UTC,"Sounds tight, I'll have to give it a go.  How long did it last?"
RCSources,3duskq,Golden-Era,2,Sun Jul 19 20:10:42 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly it was around an hour and a half, maybe even two."
RCSources,3duskq,blackmortem,2,Sun Jul 19 20:25:49 2015 UTC,Roughly same as orally. 6ish hours.
RCSources,3duskq,blackmortem,2,Sun Jul 19 20:32:27 2015 UTC,"Damn, I don't remember tripping that long when I vaped it. I'll have to give it a go again."
RCSources,3duskq,Golden-Era,2,Sun Jul 19 20:45:00 2015 UTC,The first 3 hours are significantly more psychedelic for 5-MeO-MiPT especially when vaped. It may just be that it calmed down into that MDMAish body high it has and you didn't recognise that you were still tripping because it's nothing compared to how hard you were just tripping. I definitely didn't come down all the way until T + 6 or 7 hours though
RCSources,3duskq,pink_e_pie,2,Sun Jul 19 20:49:47 2015 UTC,"Conversion to freebase wasn't necessary but a bit of residue was left on the pipe, so I may try a freebase in the future. A glass dick was used with a teacandle. Heat slowly as vaporisation occurred at ~1 inch above flame. I figured I could just do an alcohol was to get it out of there, but I was unsure as to what rate degradation would occur with exposure to oxygen while I wait for it to dry. Vaping was a similar experience to oral but unique. It brings out the early psychedelia phase of this chemical. I have noticed both orally and vaporised that the effects for the first three hours are significantly more psychedelic than the latter 3-4 hours.  Edit: Dosage was 20mg vaped and 11mg oral."
RCSources,3duskq,Sonur_Odins,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:06:40 2015 UTC,"Drying an alcohol wash shouldn't take more than an hour, depending on how many mL you use, shouldn't be much.  I've had some powder in a baggie sit at RT with no loss of potency over a few weeks, but prefer to keep it in a cooler, in the dark, at least for peace of mind.  This is really much more stable that something like metocin."
RCSources,3duskq,Golden-Era,2,Sun Jul 19 20:16:15 2015 UTC,"Your lab should have a vacuum evaporator for exactly these kinds of things! Ok, this might be overkill for said task and you should be sure of your rig before adding solvent, but science!"
RCSources,3duskq,Sonur_Odins,3,Sun Jul 19 20:51:36 2015 UTC,"Haha I actually got a vacuum purged recently for processing dabs.

I've tried MDPV as well, but that was pure evil and quickly threw it out.  aPHP is quite nice insuffulated, typically as 10mg every 5-6 hours.  It takes about 10-15mins to come on and that lasts a couple hours and moves off into general physical stimulation without much euphoria.  Senses are very enhanced and the desire to work is strong.  The urge to redose is not particularly fiendish, and the comedown is okay... Mostly a headache and less patience with others.    Side effect wise, I've noticed it blocks my ability to recall memories and vocabulary readily, and discoordinates my physical actions (clumsy).  These are concerning enough to me to scale my usage back considerably, like once a week at 5-10mg on a day off, instead of 20-30mg every day (in 10mg bumps) for 2 weeks as I had be trialing.  It's okay, but there's a price to pay."
RCSources,3durr2,Golden-Era,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:07:47 2015 UTC,"I'm quite attenuated to stimulants, and I'm wondering how it would stack up compared to ethylphenidate, or the two big illegals (hypothetically, are the binding values higher or lower regarding dopamine transmission?) I take dexmethylphenidate daily for ADD and find that quite similar to cocaine, perhaps even better than all but the very best cocaine. Amphetamines have a much more clear headed high for me, with a euphoria that's much more focused than NDRI's but I seem to be hypersensitive to the physical side effects of amphetamines, so that's why I moved to the NDRI team in my treatment."

The euphoria is good for a couple hours, then falls off into general stimulation for a long time, but without much anxiety.  Caffeine gives more anxiety than aPHP.  I'd rate it better than any coke I've ever had, but I'd still prefer vyvanse/adderall any day.  No hangover or urge to dose the next day, though I've heard vaping it will basically turn you into a fiend."

RCSources,3drrqg,pink_e_pie,2,Sat Jul 18 22:54:04 2015 UTC,I just signed up with coinbase and bought some coins.  Seems easy enough but it's going to take over a week for the transfer to go through.  What setup should I use if I want to buy and spend bitcoins right away?
RCSources,3drrqg,ShuddupAustin,5,Sun Jul 19 00:32:49 2015 UTC,"Get a personal desktop wallet instead of using an exchanges wallet. It's much faster (usually between 30 and 90 minutes, no BtC transaction is instant as at least 6 blocks have to be solved for the transfer to complete/an hour is the case like 90% of the time). Not only are personal wallets faster, they are the most secure way to handle and store BtC. Those big scandals everyone read about involving MtGox and other exchanges that stole millions worth of BtC? They were just like coinbase and the other competitors. You are storing your money on a wallet on their servers. You are trusting your Btc/money/CC info with a third party. They can be compromised/hacked and your wallet can be stolen or worse, theoretically they can pull a fast one and you'll lose it all. A personal desktop wallet can only be compromised via someone using your computer manually i.e. someone steals your computer. Even then they have to know a complex series of passwords you set up and break through encryption.    I personally use Electrum for my wallet. https://electrum.org/"
RCSources,3drrqg,Automatik1,2,Sun Jul 19 01:56:02 2015 UTC,Are you saying this software will let me use my debit/credit card to buy bitcoins in 30-90 minutes? Or is it just a wallet to store them in after you complete the exchange
RCSources,3drrqg,loudpackballin,3,Sun Jul 19 05:46:53 2015 UTC,"No, you'll still have to obtain your bitcoin the same ways, the difference is you actually have your bitcoin and not someone else. Also some sites will block your account if you send directly to vendors since that would 'make them an accomplice'  This is really just an extra step in safety, both for your money and anonymity - buy the coin and immediately store it in your personal wallet, bonus points if you set up your wallet through tails without an internet connection and purge your memory before booting back to your regular OS. As long as you always backup your wallet, this method means that no one should be able to pull your coin out without the passphrase, even if they have your actual computer.  I personally wouldn't use bitcoin for clearnet/legal chems, but if you're worried about being investigated, want a better deal (for a little trust), etc, then this is the absolute best way to go."

Unless you have a fool proof legal defense to show that what you were purchasing was being used in a laboratory setting (e.g. GC/MS equipment, full reagent set, rudimentary chemistry equipment) then I believe chasing a veritable drug dealer across the Internet for stealing your money is giving law enforcement a huge lead to investigate everyone involved. And when it comes down to it, you don't want to be involved with them at all.

RCSources,3dn1fm,Dabblin,-5,Fri Jul 17 22:50:53 2015 UTC,"Do you know how much time it would take them to track everyone down and determine whether the research was legitimate or not? Besides, the law is 'not for human consumption' so all you would have to say is you have the chemicals for collection at this stage and plan to do research later on. It's not that big of a deal.  So, A: I don't think they are going to bother. If they were going to bother, they would have a long time ago. They have better things to do.   And B: They are mainly going to worry about this company A: not paying taxes, and probably not having permits or W3s for their workers, and theft, so they are going to just deal with that. Law enforcement knows about the RC scene. You don't think they do? This isn't a 'huge lead'. It is nothing. If anything, it will just make them look at vendors more closely which could be a good thing because it could legitimize research chemical companies a little more. The law has already stated that research chemicals are legal, and if you don't intend to consume it, and even if you don't intend to sell for human consumption and make that obvious (which I think IC did based on all of their Reddit posts in threads that talked about consuming their chemicals, thus saying they probably read that people were using these chemicals illegally and still sold to those people) then IC is going to get FUCKED and that is it. Law enforcement does what they can. They are busy, but they eventually outlaw things based on harm to the community or whatever, when they get the time.   If anything, just edit any posts you wrote about human consumption to something different and then delete the comment (reddit saves deleted comments).

The point of my comment wasn't to condemn, it was to encourage exercising an abundance of caution to our community here.   Think of it this way. If law enforcement served a search warrant at your house due to this investigation (which happened to low level consumers in the UK and USA)  and found chemicals labeled 2-fluoroAMPHETAMINE, etc., you tell me what you think would happen.

Still, you make a good point, but I think most of the people who were even arrested had admitted at some point to human consumption, and, like I said, I believe they were going after people who were ordering large amounts, that would indicate dealing.

A plea bargain means that you still take the conviction, with a reduced sentence, which also costs thousands of dollars more since your lawyer has to come up with some convoluted explanation as to why the crime you committed wasn't ""that bad"". You've missed my point entirely. This isn't about the direct harm to yourself. I'm encouraging everyone to be overly cautious to prevent harm to themselves, their families, and this community. The point isn't to prevent a conviction or sentencing from being handed to you, it's to prevent the creation of an environment where that was possible in the first place.

I have dealt with shitty vendors in the past and still got my order. This is the first time I've ever seen anything as crazy as this from a US vendor. At least on this magnitude. He did it so well. With other vendors, I had warning that people weren't getting their shit and avoided them. He seemed to have gotten orders out, then suddenly scammed a fuck load of people. He'd been around for a long time fulfilling orders. He had a large customer base, which is why so many people got scammed.   I might have been naive, but this is partially the name of the game.

However, even though I called him smart, I think he really is an idiot. Somebody will find him. Locally, he is probably a scammer too. There is no way he made enough to just leave the country. Even if he did, he is going to end up scamming people there too and probably be killed unless he was smart enough to go to the UK or something (where he just end up without a job because even there he will probably try and fuck people over and steal from his employer, if he is even able to get one without a work visa).   This guy is dumb as fuck. I hate to say it, but I hope a gang gets a hold of him. I really don't like to incite violence, and I'd rather the IRS or somebody just got him fucked for stealing all that money he won't pay taxes on. If that doesn't happen though, he probably fucked over a gang member and they really don't mess around.

Bringing unwanted attention to the scene is worse than losing your money, as it could potentially result in higher interest from LEO either directly or indirectly (ie. Thru this coin service investigating them for fraud). Think about it, would you rather walk away with a monetary loss or lose the ability to order these compounds....because that's what happens when more attention is directed towards this scene.   Vendors have gotten shut down because some asshole filed a complaint thru paypal. The bottom line is don't spend money in this industry if you can't afford to lose it and please don't bring unwanted attention to the scene because it hurts us all.

They could both agree to do this, so it would only make sense if the same third-party handled all vendor transactions (in separate accounts obviously) included in their service. The drawbacks are 2-fold, but I think a fair compromise for all: the service would take a small fee and the seller would have to wait to receive payment. If handled in volume, I think the fee could easily be small enough to make the buyer happy for it.  Of course, you could choose not to use the service, but ideally you'd want 50% of transaction totals through the service so if the vendor jets, they lose half of their unconfirmed shipments.  As for who the third party is? It'd almost have to be several people, distinctly separate people for that matter (no 5 accounts between 3 people, etc) to keep the whole thing from getting tied up in case a user or two happen to get arrested or in an accident. Decentralizing is the only safe way to go if you're not going to run a legit business, which is what I'd personally prefer for grey-market.

Of course, these thoughts are not to be taken as advice, just trying to start some simple discourse.  However, I do agree with you about finding something cool with a longer half life than B.F.

I'd be a bit put off for being the first to try an opioid compared to say a psychedelic.  The law is really all that's stopping someone from growing their own poppies and making heroin.

They could have really made a mint by charging a bit more and actually delivering on their promises.

Think about it, if you're getting out of the business for any reason at all, why not take a few thousand dollars for free on the way out and then disappear? Nobody can contact the authorities about it because it's a legality issue. It's a huge scumbag move and completely immoral, but unfortunately not everyone in the world is a good person. It sucks but it's reality.   Be skeptical, and be aware that this can happen at any time to anyone when you're ordering these things.

He played our small precious community perfectly.  And he probably is eating popcorn, counting the Bitcoins as they continue to stack up in his account.

I'd hate to be the one to say this, because it goes against a lot of my beliefs, but is there anyway to rat that/those fuckers out, starting with  LEO and the major crypto currency sites like Coinbase?

Edit: yeah this guy lost a shitload of karma. The community has seen the tracking number, there's the start of a paper trail. I wonder if it was printed or bought in Florida. Plus the guys who got the first only shipment all have or had tracking numbers. I wonder if those came from FL as well?

Surely there are a few here who have connections with LEO and maybe they can run the prints, under the table?  If so, please remember to wear latex or rubber gloves while unpacking.  Also, one could take macro pictures of said fingerprints to share with all here, as everyone can be a resource.   Is it possible to call USPS with the hoarded out TNs and ask for information regarding the return address?  In the mean time, maybe over on one of the lawyer subreddits where actual lawyers meet and chat with Law School students can shed some light.  After all, Lawyers tend to be some of the biggest drug users I know of!  Maybe we can find a Lawyer Redditor who is willing to help,perhaps even go as far as Pro-bono.    And the Computer techies out there who know how to trace and hack, I pray they come out of the woods and chip in.    EDIT:  I also would not be surprised if there is a Coinpayment Subreddit or Coinbase Subreddit, or any crypto currency subreddit where someone can chime in with some knowledge.  EDIT2:  Think about it.  If the fingerprints come back hot, as in already in a data base (meaning prior offenses of said culprits), that alone could be grounds for a search warrant.  And if they really are carrying substances that fall under the Federal Analogue Act and selling them, it seems a lot of problems would arise for our enemies.  Even if no one is convicted, it'll still drag their dumb asses through the legal system and require substantial amounts of cash.

I'll email them again, but I think it is increasingly likely that they just pulled a very successful clearnet exit scam."

Finally grams of Etizolam for only $50, and Clonazolam for $80."" I went to the bank and deposited some cash, got ready to buy some bitcoins and make a purchase with IC. But after this week, everything with them went to shit.  I'm glad I didn't order from IC, but I am really devastated because my hopes were so high. Where else can I find domestic diazepines for the reasonable prices of old?  The best I have found is Qualityetizolam and after doing business with him twice, I'd say hes very professional.  But those fucking prices!  $85 plus shipping for a quarter gram of Clonazolam.  Fuck man. Why can't I find domestic powder reasonably priced in the USA?  When the hell is TMB coming back to save us all?  What happened to DLL?  The scene kinda sucks right now, unless money is not an issue."

Priority mail is usually 2 days and the 3rd day is usually a fall back. I'm interested to know if people who received a previous order had priority 3 day. Also, this is the first order that doesn't show up on the dashboard when you log in to USPS. Which uses mailed to address.  edit: I think we can all agree that in that slim chance they do what to make it right that only one email is needed.

They may be tricking us in purpose because emails are tracked on clear text sometimes, and there are actually multiple tracking  numbers.   I  am being an optimist though I'm like 90 percent sure we're fucked. But I'll say this,  a LEGIT vendor sent something from cali (I'm in the NW)  and the pkg is in North Carolina right now.

I doubt I'll get a reply today either (emailed them today again, like you) but hopefully they will just restock or whatever and get the orders out.   I wonder if the 'website being down' thing was a bunch of bullshit too and they were waiting on product then, maybe trying to get more money to get a bigger order? Ridiculous.

You have purchasing power and decided it was a fair deal to buy at the originally arranged price. Nobody forced you to purchase. You have no claim to mistreatment because they lowered their prices after your order.  They were likely able to offer that drastic of a reduction because their prior business, like yours, allowed them more funds to purchase in bulk. There has to be a cut-off somewhere and you're it.

I emailed them again saying that it still didn't come and they have not responded to that after almost 24 hours.  I'm sure it will all work out in the end, but it is rather annoying that they keep stringing everyone along with this ""just wait one more day"" crap when they know full well that the packs never got shipped."

It is strange though that the contact was so quick yesterday, up until right before the actual problem got solved, but maybe their email load isn't that heavy. I think they said they have a PR guy so I guess he can do the emails 24/7 which might explain why he is able to answer what I'm sure is a flood of emails so quick.

I think the implication from the ruling is that there's a requisite level of expertise needed to determine ""legality"" in this case. That is to say, one could be aware of the CSA, but not have the requisite chemistry knowledge to be able to decide for oneself what is covered by it - one can have the layman knowledge to obey the law, but not the expertise to arbitrate. There's a certain strange logic to the ruling that I think I get, but which I'm having a difficult time articulating.  Either way, very surprising ruling."

It's definitely a massive source of them, but this chemical completely disappeared off the map in less than a year. It was rather immediate too, you figure there'd be some places with leftover supplies or some illegal production somewhere but nope. MDMA is illegal everywhere and it's WAY easier to source than this stuff, which sucks because it's one of the only chemicals that people refer to as ""better"" than MDMA."
RCSources,3dgq01,al_eberia,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:19:09 2015 UTC,"China produces the vast majority of them though. Sure there are a few labs in Europe but nearly everything comes from China so what they ban/discourage will impact what is sold. Several of the largest EU countries (Germany, UK) have banned it so even the European labs would cook up something different that could be sold in the most places rather than something legally limited.  Edit: There was also tons of very negative media hype directed at it in the UK and there were also some deaths attributed to it.

Even though when they do understand it and think they know what theyre taking is often spurious. But those counterfeits are just going to be substituted for cheaper alternatives than 6-APB.
RCSources,3dgq01,draz93,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:11:52 2015 UTC,"MDMA is not a research chemical, though. Unless you're talking about a country other than America.   The only instance I've ever heard of it being used for human consumption in America is recently with mental health treatment. The other time I heard of it being used was when it was better defined as a research chemical, in the 70s."
RCSources,3dgq01,nuitk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:00:46 2015 UTC,"MDMA is not a research chemical, though   Yeah thats just what I mean. Besides the specially sanctioned trials they do nowadays in the 70s there was no analogue act so human research and and use for things like psychotherapy was legitimate."
RCSources,3dgq01,nuitk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:12:42 2015 UTC,Or they've just realized that people are willing to buy just as much of the alternatives that are allegedly much easier/cheaper to manufacture.
RCSources,3dgq01,Vegetano,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:09:27 2015 UTC,i heard the synthesis is quite hard also
RCSources,3dgq01,shtuf,0,Thu Jul 16 08:47:19 2015 UTC,"I heard the synth isn't the easiest, often leaving inactive or unwanted byproducts like 4-apb as a large percentage of the yield.  No one has ever posted results from of an official purity test, but myself and many others have had great luck with the batch that Tic was selling. It was sold as the Hcl form of 6-apb and it looked like little tan pebbles - very unique.  Whatever it is/way - I prefer it over MDMA or any other empathogen any day of the week. Longer duration, decrease in urge to redose, less toxic feeling hangover (none at all for me so far)...basically what I refer to as ""rolling for grown ups"".  6-APB isn't the only chemical on a lot of people's wish-list that clearly the suppliers aren't able to meet customers' demands. 4-MAR and phenmetrazine have long been in demand in the black market by stimheads yet no one has stepped up to the plate to produce them. Methaqualone (thanks to Wolf of Wall Street) is another that comes to mind. A lot of folks in the nootropic/self-improvement cmomounity would really like to see Tianeptine's ancestor, Amineptine, made available as well.  What I wouldn't give to be Shulgin for a few days back when he had his DEA license and access to just about any precursor. He could probably homebrew any one of these chems for personal sampling purposes very quickly."
RCSources,3dgq01,amphoteric12,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:50:48 2015 UTC,"When you said ""Tic was selling"", do you mean what he's selling now isn't 6-apb? I haven't talked to him for a few months but I think he's still selling it."

I made my second order Saturday, claimed was shipped Monday, and was told if I don't see it Thursday they will reship.  It usually takes 3-4 days for me to receive from their location 3-4 so that is not out of normal, but on the longer side.  I feel comfortable with everything though for three reasons 1. My first order was very quick, professional and of high quality 2.  I feel their generous offers for reships is not due to ""them knowing they weren't sent"" but either due to A. Honestly knowing they will get there in the stand of time given, so it's really no more than a token of good will in case something did go wrong 3. People making recent orders are getting tracking  And this is more anictodal but in my experience, scam vendors just take some orders and stop communicating, not keeping making efforts to keep users informed.  Fuck dll made some growing pain mistakes, I waited 2 months for a 300 dollar order, but I still consider him the best in recent past. So in summary I feel I will get the $100 plus order in limbo, even if it requires a reship.  That said my order contain almost every product they ordered minus three, and frankly if I require a reship the only way I will keep a positive outlook of their services is if I get an extra sample or at the very least some extra product.

I am missing orders 2 and 3 of 5. Received order #1.  Our team is every bit as disappointed as you I'll bet, since there's several of us, but it is too early to say that they are an active scam.  Don't order any more, that's for sure... but there have been plenty of instances where people get really upset through a forum where one person suggests XYZ and the rest worried about it get up in arms and it turns out to be perfectly understandable.  The fact that the RCs in question, when taken internally despite warning, induce a strong craving effect makes this a complicated situation."

I don't know either.   I do know our team is missing an order and we have asked for a reship.   I do know that based on the numbers,  either the people who have spoken up are all of them,  and placed dozens of orders per person, or there's a bunch of people that got theirs that haven't spoken up.  Or a huge silent,  screwed over group of people   I know if we as people are worried about being burned and see other people worried and see no contrary evidence,  scares like this happen.   Until it is absolutely clear there is no other possibility that created these circumstances,  it may be too early to judge.     Again.  We probably have more tied up than most people.  $200+  We are concerned too.  However,  I personally have had a longer ship and arrival times for vacuum parts.

The puking period of the trip I had some very strong vertigo going on and I suspect that to be the cause of me puking, it happened twice and both times were when I stood up from laying down.

The 5-MeO-MiPT was in a relatively large bag for 200mg of powder and taped on the inside of plain folded card-stock. It was also unlabeled.

RCSources,3dg0sw,effrightscorp,2,Wed Jul 15 23:54:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your review!  I appreciate you taking the time to do the write-up.  I have a few things I'd like add:   I have taken care of the adhesive issue IMMEDIATELY.  There will be no more problems going forward as I am gluing the envelopes shut.  Tape would be a red flag and easily 'characterize' my packaging. The bags are 3""x 4"", and while large in comparison to the powder sample, the residue can be recollected after drying an alcohol wash of the bag.  PM if you'd like the instructions!   Please let me know if there's anything else I can do better or any products you'd like to see.  Thanks and I look foward to hearing about your experience. :)"

RCSources,3dbxr5,Intothekhole,6,Wed Jul 15 02:02:20 2015 UTC,"Waiting on two different shipments that were shipped ""without tracking"". I emailed them yesterday and they said if it hasn't arrived by today then to email them back for a reship. I think I have a 99% chance I'll be emailing them back for a reship. sigh  My international orders and my purpleghost orders have all arrived before IC.   If this keeps up for the majority of the community is it safe to say we'll list them as a unreliable or scam vendor? I hope they pull thru because the [US] needs more reliable vendors. So....fingers crossed. Let's keep each other informed."
RCSources,3dbxr5,RandomWildThing,2,Wed Jul 15 11:56:36 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what they emailed me too. But they know it's not coming...why are they wasting my time for another day?
RCSources,3dbxr5,Redditor_on_LSD,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:17:05 2015 UTC,"I have one that was shipped with tracking supposedly one day after the one without tracking was marked shipped, and it looks like it'll be here tomorrow. If the one that I didn't get tracking on doesn't arrive, I'll have to shoot them a message."
RCSources,3dbxr5,hypherism,4,Thu Jul 16 09:08:17 2015 UTC,"I just placed an order last night and I am not worried about it at all. I think they are just swamped and struggling to keep up, especially after their issues with their webhost and stuff. I believe everyone just needs to be patient and their orders will arrive. As far as I know, I have not seen anyone say that they never received a package, just that it took longer than they were told it would  EDIT: and just a heads up, my order was a little over order 1300 and /u/JenGarden said their order about 2-3 days ago was nearly 1200, so they are getting lots of orders every single day, so be patient everybody"
RCSources,3dbxr5,Beasm,3,Wed Jul 15 14:51:15 2015 UTC,"My order was shipped friday, promised to arrive monday, and has yet to show up. No tracking even though I payed for it, so yeah I'm a little pissed off to say the least."
RCSources,3dbxr5,xPario,2,Wed Jul 15 15:03:45 2015 UTC,"I'd send an email and ask if you really feel the need, but I personally would give it a few more days and then email them for sure"
RCSources,3dbxr5,Beasm,0,Wed Jul 15 15:08:23 2015 UTC,"I wonder if they actually shipped the ones and you didn't get it in 4 days from ship date, got a reship.. would you get double your order?  Edit: of course you would. Genius!!"
RCSources,3dbxr5,Dabblin,0,Wed Jul 15 21:54:12 2015 UTC,"When I received my first package that had tracking, it shipped on 7/3 and arrived 7/8. That's about 4 business days, so if it were shipped Friday it's probably time to be concerned if it hasn't arrived by end of the day Wednesday.   Maybe they shouldn't have said Monday for an arrival time, but I would say give it time. :)"
RCSources,3dbxr5,JenGarden,3,Wed Jul 15 17:45:45 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Sure, priority mail might take 4 business days, especially around a holiday. But all of these people (myself included) that didn't get tracking still don't have our orders? I don't buy it. Priority mail never takes more than two days for me; it would be absurd for all the non-tracked packages to coincidentally be taking the max days for Priority mail to arrive.  I'm feeling more jerked around now than I did when they my paid order was just sitting out there a week unshipped."
RCSources,3dbxr5,LadyOnAvon,2,Wed Jul 15 19:24:14 2015 UTC,"When I had tracking, it took 4 business days. Not the fastest shipping ever, but we did a review when we got it.  We received the tracking notice late at night on 7/3, so we assume it was shipped 7/4. Considering it was a holiday, it may have shipped in under 4 business days, I don't know. All I know is the data in that link there.  Our most recent two orders we placed were shipped together, and our tracking number is active and moving as of yesterday. We have had updates today. We're optimistic and have every intention of updating the community when they arrive. :)  While I agree that it would be absurd that all non-tracked packages are coincidentally taking the max shipping time, consider this scenario.   An employee/contractor at IC screws up and doesn't tell anyone. They just say they shipped a bunch out. They shipped them, but it was later than they said because they decided to blow off work for a bit to go to the lake on a nice summer's day. They just fibbed about it because they were worried about losing their job. Or they got behind because they had a bunch of packages to take care of in one day. Maybe they have depression and had a bad day. There are lots of simple explanations that could make this same thing happen.  Who doesn't know someone who has done that before? It still sucks, but it may also be the whole company getting burned by one shipper. We simply don't know and it's too early to tell for sure.  What I do know (and from personal experience working with Reddit as a customer base) is the power of suggestion can be super powerful. Keep in mind hundreds of orders have been placed... how many people exactly are commenting here? 10-20 individuals tops? Even if we assume 5 orders per person and 20 people commenting, that's only 10% of the number of orders they seem to have taken. That's still quite the assumption... but I would also bet that the people most likely to vocally complain are ones that have the most to lose, like our team here. (Nearly $250 in several orders.)  If those other people aren't commenting because they're happy, that's a very good success rate as a whole. It still sucks for some of us, but I'm personally trying to look at the big picture here. We simply don't have evidence that a majority of people are not receiving them, just that the people who haven't are being vocal about it.  We have two packages without tracking, so please don't think I am dismissive! I am there with you, and hoping our wayward package arrives today. We have nearly $250 in samples in transit, we feel your pain here. :| Heck, I need them to get here so I can get lab time! Otherwise I am polishing beakers. Yay."
RCSources,3dbxr5,JenGarden,2,Wed Jul 15 21:10:57 2015 UTC,Totally. Imagine expecting 20-30 orders a day and getting 2-3 times that!
RCSources,3dbxr5,JenGarden,2,Wed Jul 15 15:01:40 2015 UTC,"Especially if they have several locations and some of which aren't stocked with every product, it's just a matter of time but I'm confident that most people will be receiving their orders, just not as quickly as they had hoped"
RCSources,3dbxr5,Beasm,2,Wed Jul 15 15:06:05 2015 UTC,"I have been getting a nice WD this past week, that's for sure. 7 days without amphs. Oh lord."

RCSources,3dbxr5,PANTIESINABUNCH_,3,Wed Jul 15 22:49:44 2015 UTC,Welcome to the club.
RCSources,3dbxr5,xPario,5,Thu Jul 16 00:13:20 2015 UTC,"I also have active tracking on my package, and a promise to reship the missing one. I am seeing the most recent package which is two orders in one tracking like the first order I received.   Considering how many people are ordering (my order from 2 days ago was nearly order 1200) I think they just got hit with a lot and just couldn't be prepared reasonably because there is no real marketing data.  It is a lot easier to say ""they should have known...""  than to get an idea of volume and staff up for it,  especially if the revenue to hire more shippers wasn't there until orders came in.   Assuming ~1000 orders since the 27th, they are processing at least 60 orders a day. Considering they probably also have to manage their emails and customer service and all these threads too,  I could see them working hard at shipping them all especially if they were caught off guard by the sheer volume.   Especially if they have day jobs too.   There isn't a lot of active market research on the rc market.  Normal businesses have a lot in the way of marketing data before launching. As frustrating as it can be,  I feel it is not fair to evaluate what as happened by the same standards as like amazon.  I have had a worse experience buying parts for a pressure cooker at a specialty store, and they have access to more market research than any rc vendor could have...    I really want to order again,  we definitely will when our order arrives.  Last time it was 5 business days to the PNW.   (Edit: Corrected a spelling error)"
RCSources,3dbxr5,JenGarden,3,Wed Jul 15 07:02:16 2015 UTC,Holy shit...I didn't even realize the order numbers. Mine was in the 700s. Last week. Holy shit.
RCSources,3dbxr5,Redditor_on_LSD,2,Wed Jul 15 15:13:39 2015 UTC,"Right? Who could ship that much alone in this time period? The order I received already was number 490 something. It's been 16 days or so? a thousand orders in that time is a lot to handle logistically.  I think it's much more likely that one employee screwed up and shipped a bunch of packages a day or two later, forgot the tracking numbers or in fact, did exclude them because they felt it was safer (whether that's accurate or not), and said they shipped it earlier to cover their butts.  Who here knows an employee or a team member at a job they've worked at that lied to cover an accident or just being lazy? I'll bet literally everyone... I'm still holding out hope. The tracking number I got yesterday AM is active and the package is in motion, so unless I get a box of dirty socks I think things are back on track. :)"
RCSources,3dbxr5,JenGarden,2,Wed Jul 15 17:54:05 2015 UTC,At least 6 people all received the same tracking number.

RCSources,3dbxr5,adam2222,7,Thu Jul 16 21:11:41 2015 UTC,yeah my guess is they just said they shipped them to buy themselves some time
RCSources,3dbxr5,JenGarden,3,Wed Jul 15 04:36:11 2015 UTC,"Or it could be that the company as a whole is OK, just one shipper dropped the ball or something like that.   From my experience consulting for online retailers (my day job) it could easily be one person making a mistake, or saying they shipped them one day and shipping them another day because they were afraid of being fired or whatever for being late. It could just be one employee screwing up and trying to cover their butt. That happens so much in business it's practically a cliche."
RCSources,3dbxr5,Redditor_on_LSD,2,Wed Jul 15 05:13:34 2015 UTC,"This is what's pissing me off...because I was told I should wait today to check my mail then email again if I don't receive it even though it's been 4 days. Like dude, if you know it's not coming then you're just wasting my time."
RCSources,3dbxr5,adam2222,2,Wed Jul 15 14:59:59 2015 UTC,"I placed an order last week.

RCSources,3d95gm,neep6,3,Tue Jul 14 15:33:59 2015 UTC,Did you have to sign for the package?
RCSources,3d95gm,neep6,-1,Tue Jul 14 15:43:15 2015 UTC,"Good question. I'm not actually sure, because I was not present when the package when it was delivered, and my mailbox had other (regular mail) stuff in it, so they left a note. I picked it up the next morning at the post office (I tend to do this a lot so it doesn't alarm me).  I actually just checked tracking to clarify, ""Notice Left (Receptacle Full/Item Oversized)"" looks like it didn't require a signature."
RCSources,3d95gm,phagemasterflex,3,Tue Jul 14 15:53:30 2015 UTC,It says on their website they require one. Do you think regular shipping would be fine with their stealth? They say it takes much longer but I'd be willing to wait.

With new substances, it's hard to get an idea of how it affects people unless people talk about it.  I have yet to try my al-lad, 1p, and I'd like to get lsz some time, but not in a rush to source it.

Last time I said that I got downvoted to hell, but look at the facts.  1) They take a bunch of orders that somehow disappear. 2) Offer to reship lost orders but take 2 weeks to do so and are still taking orders in the meantime. 3) They post info about stocking 3 very desirable chems after sending out a few of the orders that were backlogged in order resolve some of the negative reviews. They claimed to have been totally caught up and ready to take and fill new orders just before they advertised all the new products. 4) Disappear a day or two later from the forums and stop responding to emails.

RCSources,3d9e5x,katza601,3,Wed Jul 15 00:39:02 2015 UTC,"I'll add to that.  Somewhere between fact 2 and 3, they lowered their prices by half.  I ordered on the 27th, same as you.  I had to hassle them over email to actually get them to ship it, (who knows if they actually did).   It shipped last Thursday, July 9th, 12 days after I ordered.  This was the day they lowered their prices, so I talked to their PR guy and I was told I would get a half gram free of 2-FA on my next order. So I place another order.  Then 2 days later they add new products, my 2nd order still hadn't shipped yet.  I talk to their PR guy and he said if I placed a third order, they could add it to my 2nd one and add a little extra since I'd be paying for shipping twice.  This all sounded fine to me, third order placed.  A few hours later, my 2nd order gets marked as shipped, but not the 3rd.  Guy says, oh they must have already packaged it, your 3rd order will go out later. (It was marked as shipped Monday)  Nothing has arrived.  I'm not really shook over it, it was only a little over $100 in total, but damn did I want that 2-FA. :P  TL;DR I'm a dumbass who is easily incentivized into placing more orders and throwing money away."

RCSources,3d26tt,Intothekhole,7,Sun Jul 12 22:42:25 2015 UTC,"Alright this is going to be my final InfinityChems post. Sorry OP if this is only tangentially related to your question.  To start off, I’d just like to apologize to IC for being a huge asshole about this; that is not a good way to effectively get my point across. I’m going to try and be more helpful here and hopefully give him some constructive criticism.   Here are some of the problems I see with his operation:   Shipping:   According to IC, in addition to a “PR guy” and someone working on the site, he also has four people on the payroll that ship out orders who are separated by large distances and seemingly go long periods of time without communicating with one another. That seems like a bit of a clusterfuck of an operation that I have never seen with any vendor, in either the grey or darknet markets. Surely it would be 100x easier having one or more employees from the same general area that ship out the orders?   And suppose (as was the case for me), you order three different products from IC: would these all be shipped out at the same time or would these be covered one to three different individuals? I was also not provided tracking on my order although other people were, which he explained as being a problem with one of his shippers. That should really be standardized instead of being at the discretion of an individual employee.    Site Transparency:   His site went through these problems for 2+ weeks without him making much of an effort to close up shop and handle them, all while taking on new orders:     When I placed my order, my payment went through, although his site didn't register it and my items were still in checkout.   When my order confirmation was sent to my email, it went directly to my spam folder. I'm not using some obscure web email account either, I used gmail. That's also a major problem.  He admitted to losing a huge number of orders due to backup issues, which may or may have not been resolved.  His site was unaccessible for large periods of time.      Testing   This is more aimed at all RC sites and not IC in particular, but I still thought it warranted mention:   Like all RC sites, IC is buying his chems from Chinese vendors notorious for being unreliable and shipping out the wrong thing on a regular basis. That’s actually pretty par for the course for anything from China, where “Made in China” has come to mean “of unknown and poor quality”.  As someone making money shipping out these chemicals to people, I feel like it’s not too much to ask to make sure what you’re sending is actually what you say it is. That means getting a GC MS data sheet for all products you’re selling. Don’t these Chinese companies provide that to you or is he literally relying on personal bioassays and simple reagent tests to do this? In the case of something like MXE, this WILL NOT distinguish between MXP, which was being shipped out by many Chinese suppliers recently in response to a possible backlash from the Chinese police.   He has said that he will be sending samples of his product(s) to  Energy Control (a GC MS testing company). That’s great news, but I feel like he should have done that as soon as he got it before sending it out to people when he has no way of knowing if it’s actually what he says it is. If you’re going to pretend that you’re some respected research chemical company selling chemicals “not for human consumption”, testing your shit ahead of time is not too much to ask for. Simply taking a picture of your product’s consistency tells us nothing when 99% of organic chemicals are some form of white crystals.   Final Thoughts    There’s a lot of things sketchy about this operation that I’m deeply suspicious of. It’s doesn’t seem likely that he’s scamming, but he’s at the very least being incredibly unprofessional. When you’re dealing with so many issues, it’s not normal to “make it up to everyone” by making even more RC’s in your shop available when you clearly haven’t resolved the mountain of problems affecting your operation, including simply getting your backlogged orders to your customers (in my case, I still haven’t even received tracking on my order that I purchased 13 days ago). Surely that would complicate problems by making you promise thing you can’t deliver.  Tl;dr: I’ve officially thought about this for too long.  Edit: He definitely just scammed everybody. My only regret is trying to listen to other people's POV here when it was clear what they were doing."

RCSources,3cyssl,sstthrowawayyyy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:58:18 2015 UTC,"Legally, he's completely correct though.  Analogue act prosecutions are only ever applicable when said analog is of a substance scheduled either in Schedule I or II.  You are much more protected in a legal sense ordering things like MXE or Etizolam (which does not apply at all to the Analog Act as it is a thieno, not a benzo) than you are with things like fluorinated amphetamines, 4-substituted tryptamines or the novel lysergamides.  That said, ""not for human consumption"" goes a long way, longer than most people let on. Back when the DEA was raiding smoke shops in 2012/2013 for selling Spice/K2 a big portion of their evidence for the case was from sending in undercovers wearing wires and asking the store owner if the ""incense"" would ""fuck them up"" or get them super high.  It's a bit harder to demonstrate legitimate use for research (or rather feign it) from an end-user side, but is possible...  I would bet anything under 25g though would just result in a love letter, all things considered. It's often too hard of a case for a prosecutor to pursue when trying to establish human consumption on behalf of the recipient.

Someone just happened to have logged all the vendor ratings from SoS?  I highly suspect the people running this site are involved with sabotaging SoS and likely used scanning tools to grab their vendor database.  You seem to be plugging it in multiple locations.

If your making a solution, take your oral syringe and squirt a couple milliliters of your solvent into the bag. I use everclear with etizolam. It will dissolve all the powder stuck to the bag and you can just pour it back out into your receiving container. Loss will be minimal this way."

We might sell them, but we would only have about 10g or so of 4-AcO-DMT, 4-HO-MET, and 4-AcO-MET. We will post an update if we end up receiving it on time tomorrow."
RCSources,3cv228,allthereis_isnothing,3,Sat Jul 11 03:13:52 2015 UTC,Yeah that's definitely not enough to hold supply. You could however sell $10 samples for 100mg for them to poll interest and see if the tryptamines would be a viable chemical to sell. I'm assuming you don't know purity yet so this could also be a good opportunity to test purity and see if your supplier is providing you with high quality tryptamines. Best of luck Infinity chems.
RCSources,3cv228,tugsfordrugs,4,Sat Jul 11 03:25:37 2015 UTC,"For sure. We honestly should of sent this batch along with the MXE to Energy Control. We got a little ahead of ourselves and just said fuck it and sent the MXE instead of waiting for the tryptamines. But in the next few days we'll try to get another pack sent to Energy Control. Anyways, we are positive on the quality of these chemicals due to business with this supplier in the past, and it being the same batch, but alas, data does not lie, and that's what you folks want and need."

Sure, I do see room for improvement though.  I got samples from him of his AF, a-pvp, ethylone, and 5-MAPB. Everything was quality but I haven't tested the 5-MAPB yet so I can't say on that.  Communication was a little touch and go at first but apparently the email service he was using had been down. Once that was sorted out things got moving.  The only issue was my samples were labeled 1, 2, 3, 4. I had to ask what those numbers corresponded to. I'd like to see some standard codes on his website to match up with. I'd be too easy for that to get mixed up on a per customer basis, especially being a drop shipper. I tested conservatively because I wasn't entirely confident but all was right.  The other thing was that some of my PGP messages were responded to in plaintext.  I'm interested in getting more AF in the future so hopefully things improve.  Montfort, isn't this like your 3rd website now? I know one was .onion but you had another clearnet. Why so many sites?"
RCSources,3cvpn9,OpieBot,4,Tue Jul 14 09:48:01 2015 UTC,I had a very similar experience and the exact same issue with the numbering.  When I contacted him and finally figured it out I realized that the numbering corresponded to to the to my order receipt as in it went top down (1-6 in my case).  My only issue was that I never received a tracking number.  I had been contacting him daily and ended up receiving the package before I ever received the tracking number.  I was getting a little worried because I made my order just a day before all of the drama unfolded on reddit but I was happy when I received my order.  I ended up making another order and requested a few samples.  He told me they do not normally do samples but threw in 1g of A-PVP as a free gift which is pretty cool.  I will be contacting him on monday for the tracking number so hopefully I get it this time.  I plan on writing a review of my experience once I receive this new order.
RCSources,3cvpn9,Hydrosnowcone,3,Sat Jul 18 10:54:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah when i asked about the numbering it did correspond to the same order that they were listed in the email. You just wouldn't know that without inquiring. I've seen a lot of steroid vendors that will have a list of codes on their website to match them up with. Just seems like that would be easier.  And yeah, I forgot to mention that there wasn't any tracking. It was a free sample I was doing an SoS review on and I didn't want to bother asking. This was during all the drama so I wasn't even sure if it would come. I was quite surprised that it came in about 4-5 ish days. Pretty quick.

To me, potency wise: purposechem>psychotropix>DLL. Overall preference for me: purposechem>DLL>psychotropix. However , people have this theory about MXE called tuning and the more I do, the more I it starts to resonate with me."

RCSources,3cq7yp,tugsfordrugs,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:22:47 2015 UTC,How much is purposechem per gram? I don't have the ability to check on things like that right now.  Why did you rate DLL higher than psychotropix overall? I assume because of pricing? My last batch of MXE that has lasted me around 6 months was from the vendor turcs off the DNM. He was crazy as fuck (can't emphasize that enough) but I got lucky and actually received my package. Hands down the best MXE I've ever had in my entire life. The stuff is so precious which is why I still have some left over for the right moments.  I assume by tuning you mean doing the drug enough to get used to the experience? Or...?
RCSources,3cq7yp,tugsfordrugs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:58:51 2015 UTC,"I think he's on the clearnet at 25 a g,  5 g minimum . Tho his prices on the other side are a bit cheaper I think. And DLL's seemed a lot more euphoric with more of serotonergic loved - up haze and seemed a lot smoother on my body. Psychotropix packs a punch but the high seems a bit dark with some rough edges and definitely feels taxing to my system. Purposechem is super smooth and even more euphoric than the others,  reminds me of an MDMA roll after tuning. Yes, I guess how you described it is what I understand tuning to be.  I never used turcs but I did use rcsupplier14 like last fall and it was the worst MXE I've ever had. I'm glad those psycho MXE vendors finally got replaced by people who most obviously aren't getting high on their own supply."
RCSources,3cq7yp,loudpackballin,2,Fri Jul 10 05:54:39 2015 UTC,"I will definitely look into purpose! Thanks for the heads up. Us MXE lovers gotta have each other's backs!

We can have a small amount of verification in reagent testing however."
RCSources,3cq7yp,TreesWillRise,3,Sat Jul 11 00:51:22 2015 UTC,"Reagent testing for a supplier who markets high quality research chemicals for their buyers is an outright joke and disgrace to buyers.

Sure its crude but how many times has this community been burned by lack of clarity when buying chemicals. If we allow for the suppliers to keep sending us random purity chemicals, just pure enough so our reagant turn the right color, jokes on us."

That needed to be fixed two weeks ago. When my order confirmation was sent to my email, it went directly to my spam folder. I'm not using some obscure web email account either, I used gmail. That's also a major problem. He admitted to losing a huge number of orders due to backup issues. Has that been resolved? Who the fuck knows... oh, and my order was placed after this supposedly became an issue, so it shouldn't even be a factor for me. His site was unaccessible for large periods of time, sometimes days.   Rather than take the time to solve these issues and send out more than a half-hearted apology to his customers, he's decided to TAKE ON MORE FUCKING ORDERS! Jesus fucking christ is this guy incompetent.

RCSources,3cil8h,Dick_In_Yo_Mouth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:55:45 2015 UTC,"Right. I read that on here during my research. As I said, even assuming the pellets are only .5mg instead of .7mg, they are still cheaper than the liquid which the site says is .5mg/mL. Basically it is $120 for 75mg (assuming they are actually .5mg and not .7mg) pellets and $135 for 60mg of liquid. If someone could double check my math that'd be awesome but I'm pretty sure that unless the liquid is actually STRONGER than what the site description says, it's more expensive per mg."
RCSources,3cil8h,austinnuma,2,Wed Jul 8 05:04:08 2015 UTC,"Quality is the same, but I can't really think of many reasons why the solution would be more expensive. More convenient to dose? PG could be more expensive than fillers? Instead of just pressing a pill (which I understand isn't simple) they have to measure out powder, PG, dissolve the powder in PG, and bottle it. Or perhaps they just didn't put too much thought into pricing, I have no idea.   Ninja edit; they (etiz and cLAM) maybe seemed a little more potent, but it was probably just placebo."

RCSources,3cg4lw,killalores,3,Tue Jul 7 21:06:20 2015 UTC,That sucks. I placed a order with him almost a month ago. My order was shipped like 10-15 hours after payment and I received it 2 days later. They seem to be having some trouble lately. I wanted to purchase some Clonazolam pellets but they have been out of stock for weeks :/
RCSources,3cg4lw,Themoronidiot,3,Tue Jul 7 17:33:05 2015 UTC,"Same here. I got payment confirmation 4 days ago, but no shipping. Also, he won't respond when I ask about it. Disappointing, he sounded like a reputable vendor."

RCSources,3cg4lw,katza601,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:42:20 2015 UTC,"He does eventually respond. I think I've gotten responses to all emails in 48 hours or less. My order said complete, awaiting shipment for over a week though before they finally sent off the first half of mine. I'm still waiting on my second package to be shipped. He really does need to close shop for two or three days, catch up on everything, and reopen. The fact that he's making people wait so long while still accepting and filling new orders is what irks me."
RCSources,3cg4lw,JenGarden,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:41:59 2015 UTC,"Right. I have one order that should be arriving today, but the second one is twice the size and I was planning for a 5g order shortly, now I am concerned.  I would love to give /u/InfinityChems the business, but I chose a domestic vendor for a quicker turn around time. Right now, assuming 3 days for arrival if it ships today, it will be nearly the 10 days I was quoted from Dharmachem. I understand delays, but we waited to long to place our first order in the lab here and now we're behind schedule.  I would be happy with just a response to my email or PM, it would help a lot towards making me feel like reordering again would be a good choice."
RCSources,3cg4lw,InfinityChems,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:49:14 2015 UTC,"All orders ~July 5 were dropped off today. This isn't a one man company.

Everything on this site is being updated tonight hopefully. As of now, we haven't responded to any emails we have received today, and will respond to them tomorrow morning.

Thank you for all you do, and letting me know. I can imagine the influx of orders has been difficult to deal with! :)  Jen DT Labs"
RCSources,3cg4lw,JenGarden,0,Thu Jul 9 01:49:16 2015 UTC,"I've never ordered from this vendor before, but I feel qualified to back him up and tell you that you're somehow being unreasonable. Why don't you stop being a whiny baby and cop some 3-MeO-PCP from one of the 20 local dealers that obviously supply it?!  Let's also forget that his site is still broken as hell and he's still accepting new orders, that's not important."
RCSources,3cg4lw,JenGarden,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:37:25 2015 UTC,"Well, I have worked with a lot of companies and owned a business, so I can relate to getting backed up. The problem for the business owner is when there's a huge surge in orders like this, stopping new orders causes other problems.   People getting mad because they can't place an order Loss of potential new orders to other vendors Once the orders are back up, it takes a couple days to get back to where you were   Since profitability = how service can be improved through hiring more help, I get it. It's frustrating a bit... but InfinityChems also provides research samples of some very in-demand compounds. It's hard not to see it both ways."
RCSources,3cg4lw,LadyOnAvon,0,Wed Jul 8 16:59:18 2015 UTC,"It's not even remotely difficult to implement a feature that stops accepting orders, don't act like it is. He's fucked up every step of the order processing apart from the me giving money to him part."
RCSources,3cg4lw,JenGarden,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:38:59 2015 UTC,"It's not hard, you're right. It's just that any time a business stops taking orders, it takes time to get the order ""pipeline"" back at full capacity.   If you're shut down for say, 2 days, you lose out on those days' of orders for those days, possibly permanently if they go to other vendors. Then when you go active again, you need to let people know again and the order volume for a day or two is probably lower than it would be if you hadn't shut down. So for nearly a business week, you miss out on a lot of potential revenue. From a purely business standpoint, it is a bad decision to shut down orders under any circumstances. Some vendors may elect to do so, but I can see why one wouldn't as well.  Sorry you're upset though. I'm not trying to say you're wrong for being mad or anything, just that I can see why they might choose to continue with a backlog. I hope your issue gets resolved quickly! :)"

Talking to him about it may be your best bet as a reagent test isn't too helpful in this situation. If it was me I'd probably chalk it up as a minor loss and dispose of it if I felt it was impure, but it's up to you really."

I was thinking of mixing it with some sort of stimulant to counteract the sedation, but heard this can be a dangerous combo.

RCSources,3cai97,IMG_9999,2,Mon Jul 6 11:30:42 2015 UTC,I was sceptical too but considering that they obviously sell in larger quantities to some customers its likely that they buy really large amounts from their lab. So they should get it really cheap and customers who order smaller amounts benefit from this.  I will order some 5-mapb too this week as soon as I can get some bitcoins. Too bad they only accept bank transfer for orders over 1000 / 1500 euros so I have to talk to my bank first to enable online banking for my account to buy some coins.  I will review it as soon as it arrives but propably not this week. Had some really good/potent mapb from fox-chem before but it costs twice as much. If you dont plan to order this week I'll inform you about quality as soon as possible

I heard they had problems (while selling as gagachem) with one person or even more people who odered and payed via paypal.

I assume that's using a 1ml syringe, so maybe a max solubility of 50mg/ml in distilled water?  I usually use warm tap water when making solution for injection, and stir a little bit.

Although i would say codeine is safer than most opiates, it is very weak so its not really more safe.  Youd have to take a higher dosage to get to a low dose of something else.  Scopolamine is natural and dangerous along with many other natural psychoactives.  Morphine is natural but can be very dangerous  Thebaine is natural but would kill you before youd feel recreational effects  On the other hand, LSD is synthetic and very safe.  Just because something is natural, doesnt make it anymore or anyless safe"

This is my only gripe. I've been spoiled in most vendors i deal with still ship the same day if you make their cutoff  times, and the offer express. But in sure they have their reasons for operating this way.  Shipping for me is 3 days from Fla to Ma..   It's weird that thieno rc sites don't have overnight yet lots of other rc supplies offer overnight, even dnm. Kratoms as well, almost always offer express  And he's a good talk to. Very gregarious.

RCSources,3be8gk,shtuf,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:14:53 2015 UTC,What was the experience if you don't mind sharing
RCSources,3be8gk,shtuf,2,Sun Jun 28 23:31:30 2015 UTC,"""The half-life is huge and using every other day is simply not sustainable at medium-large doses, and 3FPM at least contributed substantially to my extreme heart palpitations and involuntary hyperventilation which saw me hospitalised (my heart rate was through the roof and remained at that level for a good 3 hours after being hospitalised, subsiding gradually but still high now after being later discharged and palpitations are still present). Other factors to consider which slightly dilute the credibility/shock of the story: hadn't eaten in a day, took a small amount of caffeine (50mg in the usage period), a day without sleep. Not a very healthy situation I admit and I was probably slightly excessive with my dosages in general and frequency of redose, not too excessive though. If it were slightly generous doses that caused the issue then such a tenuous relationship based on a small increase is extremely dangerous in my opinion, particularly when the lingering presence definitely has an accumulative yet invisible presence.  Rough idea of usage over 14 days (day 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, I didn't use at all): Day 1: 600mg binge spread out over an all-nighter Day 4: 200mg spread out over a night Day 7: 200mg spread out over a night Day 10: 50mg Day 14: 200mg spread out over an all-nighter (3 hours after last dose experienced severe vasoconstriction with right foot going numb as well as an assumedly sky high heartrate, 7 hours after that exerienced major heart palpitations, hyperventilation, numb/freezing extremities, increased impact of cognitive deficiency though very tired I couldn't understand anything + had no balance) I wouldn't describe this usage as ridiculous, but I've definitely experienced the scary-side of it and feel like I was very close to death.""

RCSources,3be8gk,Shadowattunement,2,Mon Jun 29 00:25:03 2015 UTC,"If they discharged you in 3 hours odds are it was you needed some food/fluids after abusing yourself.  Any follow ups?  What is considered a sky high heart rate to you?  It varies person to person.  I've seen plenty of people who think 120-130bpm is scary high, in reality if you're healthy it's not going to pose an issue without any other circumstances surrounding it.   Sounds like anxiety mixed with no food to me"
RCSources,3be8gk,shtuf,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:32:45 2015 UTC,120-130bpm is the range I average when I'm stimming pretty good. I don't start getting scared until I see it in the 140's and rising vs falling. Curious though - as a medic (as I infer from your username and seem to recall you speaking as in previous posts) - what is truly a dangerous heart rate from stimulant usage? Is it more of a factor of the combination of BP + HR? My blood pressure oddly always seems to be fine in times when I feel uncomfortably geeked.
RCSources,3be8gk,roionsteroids,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:26:24 2015 UTC,"True, all the tests they did on me confirmed no underlying heart issues. Though the long metabolites are an issue in my opinion, and I'm pretty sure were the cause of my bad experience.  I believe it was exacerbated by anxiety/panic attack which caused me to hyperventilate, but they sent me in for the crazy high heart rate even after I started regaining feeling in my extremities and had calmed down. It was 175bpm.  Even though I just ordered 10gs of MPA, I did have a cheeky little line/drip of 3FPM and I do love it. It's just I had a bad experience with it which makes me extremely wary of long term use."
RCSources,3bd624,I_Found_Four_Oh_Four,2,Sun Jun 28 02:34:12 2015 UTC,Just got some Nifoxipam the other day simply because I saw it was available while making an order for something else.

RCSources,3bd624,All_Day88,0,Sun Jun 28 20:30:04 2015 UTC,"I don't use any substances for human consumption, just laboratory research. What I can say from my studies and what I have read is that it is an absolutely excellent anxiety reducer. It lasts a long time, is nearly impossible to black out on, and has a high affinity for sites responsible for muscle relaxation. However, unlike etizolam, I feel it could be quite dangerous if used accidentally / purposefully consumed with other downers, so be careful in that respect.   TLDR; Has the potential to be the most functional with least side effects benzo out there for anxiety and if that is what you are looking for I think you will l love it. I hope that answers your questions.  Edit: From what I can gather from my equipment, between 1.5-2mg seems to be the sweet spot for nice anxiety relief and anything above that is just a heavier version of the former, without much more 'intensity', so to speak."

I can order at 10am and have it next day. There is an option to not have reChem appear on the package.  Very consistent shipping and quality which justifies the higher prices but they do add extra if you order larger amounts.    ChemsCanada is good at times but their product is very inconsistent.

All these different sources offer at LEAST pg solutions, and those are just as effective at dosing with a proper measuring utensil.

RCSources,3batz1,onelightinthedark,2,Sat Jun 27 13:00:51 2015 UTC,"Anxiety from not sleeping, poor nutrition, and deyhydration are your biggest enemies. Force some solid protein and a decent vitamin stack while drinking plenty of water at the very least. Vasodialotors, such as l-argnine/ctiruline, niacin, and agmatine can really help with the negatives of these stimulants. Avoid caffeine like the plague - I've found it can cause near panic attack anxiety levels when stimmed up on 2-fma and the likes. Have a benzo or at least something like clonidine to counter the adrenergic rooted stimulus that causing the high heartrate/blood pressure.  To answer your question about whether 2-FMA and 3-FPM can be used within succession, or even in combination, with one another...yes. I've had active doses of both within my system at the same time, but please also remember that tolerance, weight, and other factors come into play so if you do insist on trying it tread lightly and work your way up to what feels comfortable."

The test subject always stays hydrated, takes vitamins, and eats small high-calorie foods when researching. The BP only gets slightly over normal -- 118/80 usually -- when 2-FMA is tested; I just wanted to make sure that administrating  3-FMP the day after 2-FMA wouldn't cause any nasty side effects, co-contamination, or withdrawal.  I have a constant heart rate monitor, BP device, and the usual things to smooth stim use out if the test subject starts feeling unwell under testing.  Can one switch from 2-FMA to 3-FMP in a day with no I'll-consequence?  I know stims are more psychologically addictive than physically, but it's best to ask to make sure for health reasons."

I've got an order from them held in customs in NYC since 6/17 and I have a feeling customs snagged it or isn't letting it through.

Just happened to me last week. Missed the signature opportunities both times and it just got sent back to the vendor. Emailed him about my troubles and it's on it way right now.

RCSources,3b8f3p,Wild3y3s,5,Fri Jun 26 21:43:03 2015 UTC,"Oh trust me, I am well aware of the limitations of this scale, and the prices of lab grade balances :)  The scale in question is, per manufacture I believe, +/- 0.005g, which is not great. I find personally it's least accurate at the extremes (close to zero and close to 20g). I wouldn't trust it with anything less than 20mg.  That said, I have a set of calibration weights (1mg to 100g, al sorts of increments), I run it on a solid granite surface, calibrate often, and use the draft shield where possible, and the results are surprisingly accurate. I still only do volumetric dosing for anything below 20mg though.   You can get a decent mg accurate lab scale for about 400, which isn't terrible, considering you can go into the thousands pretty easily."
RCSources,3b8f3p,6c696665696e74686572,2,Fri Jun 26 21:48:56 2015 UTC,"Like others, I definitely agree that it shouldn't be used for weights under 20mg but it actually held up pretty well when I tested it against a very expensive analytical balance which goes to the fifth decimal place (hundredth of a milligram).  I weighed out some portion of a substance into a gel cap and weighed it on both scales. The Gemini displayed 46mg l, the lab scale displayed about 45mg. I think for $20 I can deal with 1mg off as long as I'm not weighing NBOMes, DOx, or fentanyl analogs I figure I'll be ok."

They along with a lot of other companies all just got restocked so they sent the orders out just recently, as promised. Sounds like you just weren't paying attention."
RCSources,3b4r9d,hitman2989,2,Fri Jun 26 00:11:39 2015 UTC,"Ordered at the end of March.  They didn't change the status of my item back in April until I emailed them again to confirm they received payment, then they didn't mark it as shipped until I said 'hey how come you've not shipped it'.  Then when I said it hadn't arrived, they responded in May asking has it arrived. Soon later said they would REship it. In mid-May they said they would 're'ship it in one week. Then they asked me when I paid for it. Then they said it would be shipped on like the 10th of June and then eventually this week. So it's been like one month since they said they shipped it and nearly three months since I ordered it, during which time they made multiple promises to 're'ship it in the immediate future.  so yeah it was a pretty rotten customer service experience and no information provided unless I asked for it, most of that information being false. Ffs they almost certainly didn't even ship it when they marked it as shipped, that's a bad sign. Tell me why a reputable company would do that.  but it arrived now so what have I got to complain about, being strung along for nearly three months with 'I'll send it soon'. It's like the internet version of the rl dealer that keeps you waiting for five hours telling you he's round the corner whenever you call.  I'd like to see when they made clear that they were out of stock, show me what I should have been paying attention to, I read their blog updates that offered incorrect 're'shipping times. And it seems like every other customer I have bothered Googling up recently has been pissed off too.  Didn't even want to knock them too badly, maybe the guy has been having a tough time, but I don't like your tone...  oh and I had to dig out some fucking alternative email address to contact him as well so it was hard to even get in touch in the first place  other than that 10/10 service"

RCSources,3ax8mv,thewanderingblade,2,Wed Jun 24 19:49:26 2015 UTC,"I believe a distinction needs to be made between the U.S. Federal Analog act and other laws. I assume from your comment that you're referring to the Analog Act in which a chemical has to be substantially physically or effectually similar to a schedule I or II substance and intended for human consumption to be illegal.   Even though 5-MAPB (in this discussion) falls under this law, being a clear analog of MDMA, there are other laws that even schedule III (or IV, or V, or even innocuous things like baking soda and salt crystals) can fall under.  Consider that many states also have generic 'designer drug' laws on their books that outline how you can even get arrested and charged with an illegal substance if you represent something inactive as an illegal substance. People can go to prison for selling sea salt as crack under these laws. As such, it's really up to the prosecutor to decide if they want to cut you a break or throw you in jail if you end up getting caught with something like, say, Etizolam - even though it doesn't technically fall under the Analog Act nor is it explicitly illegal in most states.  I'm curious of an example in which an RC that is effectually similar to a scheduled substance is being openly sold for human consumption in the United States. Not that I don't believe you, but I'd just find it fascinating. A little over a decade ago in my state they were arresting people for possession of piperazines."

RCSources,3as3ta,Madcap70,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:25:03 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what they look like  There is 13 of them because he shipped my order late, so he added a bunch of extra ones."

RCSources,3as3ta,Shadowattunement,3,Tue Jun 23 03:04:54 2015 UTC,Never bought from this vendor but ordered 10 tabs AL-LAD wirh 150mcg from LizardLabs.eu before they changed their buisiness model. First I tested one tab but just got some bodyload and no visuals. My friends reported the same. Made a break for 2 weeks and tested 1.5. Again nothing special but had some OEVs. Couldnt beleve that these tabs dont work and took 1.5 tabs one week later. It was a great sunny day and I listened to some awsome music in my backyard. Suddenly it kicked in and was so intense. My OEVs were damn colouful and everything was breathing and moving in all direcrions. I think it has a lot to do with setting and you expectations. If you had a grat trip before on this substance you expect something similar the next time. You take it and wait until it all starts and that could be a problem. But maybe its just me that I have the wildest trips when not expecting anything great. Was the same with real LSD and 1P. And my trips get more intense when Im alone or just with one (max 2) friend(s) at home. Also I sometimes need to look at some nice psychedelic artworks and listen to psychedelic music to let my self go and start tripping. (f.e. Art like this from Cameron Gray)
RCSources,3as3ta,PsychedelicVisions,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:06:21 2015 UTC,You need at least 300 ug of al-lad before it starts to do its job.
RCSources,3as3ta,PsychedelicVisions,3,Tue Jun 23 15:05:13 2015 UTC,This is why I just don't trust people laying their own blotter.   It could be bunk or way overdosed.
RCSources,3as3ta,higherfydrant,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:30:51 2015 UTC,"I agree, I didn't know he laid the tabs himself until after I bought them. I figured it would be fine though. I'll probably just go to the DNM for AL-LAD now, so I can at least see others feedback. I can't really find much feedback on SpaceCrystals AL-LAD. Plus from what I can see, prices on the DNM are cheaper per tab, I should have just gone there first, but since AL-LAD is legal in USA I figured I'd use clearnet."

RCSources,3as1wo,Wild3y3s,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:22:52 2015 UTC,I tested it last night. I started off with 5mg and felt a slight nausea and some threshold effects and boosted another 5mg which developed into some light to moderate effects and was a pleasant experience. This is my first time taking the substance but the effects do seem to match what I read online. It's definitely an interesting substance which I look forward to experimenting with in the future.
RCSources,3as1wo,Wild3y3s,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:08:27 2015 UTC,"Sounds decent but sounds a little weak. For my test subjects, 5mg produced a good bit more than threshold effects. As a matter of fact, some didn't want anything else with just 5mg for 4-5 hours."

I recently tested 5-MeO-MiPT from BCLS, I'm waiting on trying to recover my infotomb account to upload the results, but let me look up what the marquis was....  Marquis was a yellowish brown, almost a mustard tone.  Might I ask how you found these resources? I googled a bit and only ever found one post on bluelight: http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/512598-Marquis-Mecke-Mandellin-results-for-stim-empathogen-2C-X-RC-s-amp-more  My result for marquis is slightly more browned than that one. My results for all 3 roughly match that persons results. Compared to yours, mine is slightly more yellow. Yours actually looks a lot like my mecke.  I just did an allergy test of ~1mg from a solution I made (5mg/mL) last night, felt very slight effects from it, which is what I'd expect from something dosed that lowly.  My powder is a very light tan.  Hope this info helps!"

Please send us the transaction ID via e-mail or send us a message on here with the ID. Also include your order # if you can. We'll get this corrected ASAP and refund you a little extra for time lost OR send you an order in a week with extra product in it.  We sincerely apologize for this mix up and do not want to be indebted to you for anything. We have no malicious intent behind this delay and hope to hear from you soon. Sorry for this issue and we hope we didn't royally screw up our reputation with you.  Get in touch with us. We will close this out today. Extremely sorry about this.
RCSources,3apnxw,PurpleGhostChemicals,3,Mon Jun 22 14:56:04 2015 UTC,... Why wouldn't you just send another dollar?
RCSources,3apnxw,katza601,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:15:39 2015 UTC,"Good vendor and very helpful, cant wait to order from them!"
RCSources,3apnxw,Dubstep95,3,Mon Jun 22 15:46:53 2015 UTC,"Look, it sounds like this one is YOUR mistake.   He likely saw your BTC and didn't have an order in mind or on paper that corresponded with your amount because it was off... OR he saw you shorted him (intentionally or not) and decided to put your order on hold.   Though ethically he should complete all orders before closing shop it seems he did all he thought he could do and went off business until he restocks. Which means he probably isn't reading messages or reviews.   Here is the thing, a lot of BTC services snatch a little fee of coin for transaction especially if it's such a small amount like $40. You need always buy more coin than you expect to use that way you can account for not only fees but fluctuation. The value of your coin can change in seconds.   If I remember correctly this specific vendor not only warned about that but later on his site I think he posted that he has two btc deposits not accounted for. So when he comes back you'll likely have your order processed. It's a minor hiccup in the system. I get it you wanna get your shit now or go to someone who can make it happen. But these guys have a thousand people jumping on them the second decently priced good quality mxe is put on the shelf. I think it damn near knocked DLL off the grid. It just goes to show its tough business to do work in front of a live critical audience. Give him a chance... be patient."
RCSources,3apnxw,YouNeedAnAccount,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:56:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback on this post for us. We did not delay any orders/refunds out of neglect but just have to confirm amounts. Some of our customers deposit to the same address so if anything doesn't match up we just need to wait in order to be sure we have the right person's order to BTC.  We will work with this individual to resolve this ASAP. There is no malicious intent behind this delay. We hope to fix this issue today with /u/Dubstep95. Extremely sorry for the mix up.

RCSources,3apnxw,brandononrails,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:17:55 2015 UTC,We will definitely let it slide in certain circumstances but if the BTC amount sent doesn't match up to an order we have on file then it is hard for us to be certain it is for that order. We usually try to communicate with the customer if it doesn't match up (assuming we know who might have sent the amount). We will work with this person to get this resolved ASAP. We will NEVER hold a BTC amount or otherwise be indebted to a customer intentionally. Hope to get this resolved.
RCSources,3apnxw,PurpleGhostChemicals,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:41:55 2015 UTC,This vendor was nice enough to help me get my refund and showed great communication and people skills even though i was abit annoying and that's an A+ in my book is customer service.
RCSources,3apnxw,Dubstep95,2,Tue Jun 23 12:23:32 2015 UTC,/u/Dubstep95 -- we will refund your BTC ASAP after receiving the transaction ID from you via e-mail or reddit message. We will also give you a little extra BTC for the trouble and a free shipping coupon if you ever decide to order from us again but we understand if you don't want to do that. Please give us the order # it was attached to as well if you still have it so we can close out that order via e-mail or PM.  Extremely sorry for this mix up and hope to close this out with you.  EDIT: Refund done and free shipping coupon (1 time use) given out to Dubstep95.

I would say smaller ziploc-style bags would make the material easier to work with. I've seen black bags in convenient sizes, those could be good for light-sensitive materials like 4-AcO.  Printing all labels and addresses would be cool too, but I don't know how much goes into that.

I called my local post office and they were able to track it down, told me it'd be delivered in two days, and it was indeed.   Their public tracking website really sucks. The very nice local postman on the phone said he could see the whole progress of it on their internal system, so if it doesn't update after several, several days, call your local PO and ask very nicely if they could help look at your package's current location."

If you had read everything I wrote you'd see that I said, ""no one knows why their website is directing to spam/virus links."" If all the answers you are getting are the same and no one has been able to answer your  question sufficiently enough for you, maybe no one knows the answer?   Reiterating the question every time is not going to get you the answer, and I'm pretty sure at this point the only person who can answer this question are alkyl-research. Since you seem to think repeatedly asking the same question is necessary, I felt it necessary to give you the same answer you've been given by 5 or more different people in this thread."

I'm saying every person who has responded to you in this thread has given you the same or similar answer, they don't know why it's popping up as spam links.   They have given you the information they DO have, since it's obvious you didn't see the sample threads and what they said people assumed you might want all that information. Obviously you don't, although I'm not sure how anyone could have known that until you started acting like a self-righteous twat.   Could some brave person come in and answer your question? Sure, I guess so. But, seeing as how it's 5 hours later and you still don't have the answer you're looking for, I'm pretty sure that's not going to happen.

RCSources,3a8pby,blackmortem,3,Thu Jun 18 04:00:24 2015 UTC,Degraded 4-AcO-DMT is actually just psilocin. So either way you're going to have fun with it.
RCSources,3a8pby,2c-wasted,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:28:20 2015 UTC,Yeah I've read that but does it lose potency?
RCSources,3a8pby,blackmortem,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:53:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. I know psilocin itself is more potent that 4-AcO-DMT, but I don't know if the degradation of it leaves a byproduct (besides psilocin) with significant mass. If it doesn't it would probably gain potency.  When I had 4-AcO-DMT it turned brown, then almost into a black tar like substance. The potency seemed to be similar but the trips had a more introspective and sinister feel to them. Could have been set and setting though, who knows?"

RCSources,3a7nmz,EnviousNoob,3,Thu Jun 18 20:00:48 2015 UTC,I honestly don't think they did ship them.  They told me they'd do re-ship of an AL-LAD order where I was sent 1p-Lsd and I got no shipping notification and don't believe it was sent.

I also recall a few weeks before they closed off, there were multiple shipping issues from the Poland distributor where many US residents were not receiving orders or getting 1P rather than AL-LAD or the other way around.

Emailed them a week ago and the response was Since it was sent regular mail they have no idea what happened to it, Sorry.   I had ordered 10 tabs from them a few months earlier and got my order in about 10 days.  I'm guessing it never really shipped or a whole shipment got stolen somehow.  Sucks cause now i'm out $230 dollars."
RCSources,3a7nmz,SmokinHerb,2,Fri Jun 19 21:17:42 2015 UTC,"I guess it's possible that a shipment or an entire batch of shipments were intercepted before it left Canada. Maybe that's why they stopped shipping to the US but if that was the case they shouldn't have kept taking fucking orders.   Interestingly enough I also ordered 5/16, same product & quantity.   I'd ordered from them previously without incident, it took a little long sometimes up to 20 days but it always arrived.   At this point I'd rather have a love letter to at least know what happened to it but I truly think it was never shipped and they pocketed it.    One package being intercepted I'd believe but 3 orders intercepted with no love letter? I just don't buy it."
RCSources,3a7nmz,IMG_9999,2,Fri Jun 19 21:21:39 2015 UTC,It's pretty clear that after reading these replies that they were selectively scamming or just outright stealing money.

RCSources,3a45go,TehStickles,4,Wed Jun 17 02:14:07 2015 UTC,I'd love to know how long the effects last for you...I'm currently looking for a benzo to help me sleep and I think this might be the one  Still gonna keep looking and might just buy 10ct of a bunch of different ones and try em all I dunno yet   What dose did you take?  You didn't mention that at all
RCSources,3a45go,All_Day88,4,Wed Jun 17 02:44:47 2015 UTC,"Aloha brother, I'll try to answer your question with as much insight as possible. First, it's necessary to disclose all Diazepines I have personal experience researching throughout 16 years of adult life, majority of the those years spent as a drug addict. For the sake of this thread and educational value, to those reading this I am going to divide the Diazepines into two categories: Prescription U.S.A Diazepines, and secondly non-prescription Diazepines which are either true research chemicals or legitimate foreign pharmaceutical Diazepines such as Etizolam and Phenazepam. I've used a and abused thousands of dollars in xanax. I have a lot of experience with lorazepam, diazepam, klonopin, temazepam and I always go for the highest common amounts of milligrams per pill I.e. xanny bars, 2mg klonopin, blue valiums and so on. I've had on occasions in India, Pakistan and Nepal Benzodiazepines like nitrazepam, bromazepam and likely others I've been given in substitute by unregulated chemists who have had only obscure benzodiazepines ( but I don't recall all the names). As for RC Diazepines, I've used a couple grams of Etizolam over the last few months. I've tried a Flubromazolam PG solution from DLL, Diclazepam PG solutions from the same source, and also his Clonazolam PG solutions. But ever since he and TMB shut down, I've bought powdered substances from Qualityetiz. This included merely Clonazolam and Etizolam, for I personally find these two RCs most helpful. As for Etizolam, I find it clear headed, highly anxiolytic, fast acting and the least sedative of the two. I also love how it's hard to black out on it when barely abused (opposed to xanax). Etizolam leaves me functional during the day and motor control loss is minimal compared to all Diazepines tried. The only downside is the short Half-Life. I understand there are many who feel that would be an upside. To each their own. Clonazolam is roughly the same price, twice the potency, just as fast acting (love them Triazolo rings), but it's Half-Life is much longer compared to Etizolam, so I dose much less often. Its hypnotic effects and sedative effects are much more pronounced compared to Etizolam. I find clonazolam better for relaxing after a hard day, and Etizolam great for use during any time of day."
RCSources,3a45go,happy_fart,2,Wed Jun 17 09:48:21 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you on the clonaz for night, etiz for day time. The best part is , this morning, no hangover, no drowsiness. Only maybe a little afterglow. I'm loving this chemical. I could see myself getting out of hand with this so I'll have to be really fucking careful"
RCSources,3a45go,happy_fart,2,Wed Jun 17 13:29:10 2015 UTC,"When ever I purchase a decent amount, 90% gets handed over immediately to a trusted family member, who then will stash the bulk of my order.  We agreed on a personal daily allotment for my monkey, so he never gets too big and harm reduction is taken seriously by this proactive arrangement.  It has saved my life many times, in more than the obvious way-  everything from blackouts to car accidents, to acting stupidly in public and, of course, death or O.D."
RCSources,3a45go,All_Day88,2,Wed Jun 17 19:03:34 2015 UTC,I took 0.5mg around 650. Started feeling the effects around 8. I was on some other stuff at the time so I'm goin to give it a go tomorrow while I work to see how functional it could be while moving around. I've never had .5 of any benzodiazepine hit me as hard as this did. Very excellent chemical just not to be used daily. I can see that being problematic.   I should also be getting flux order tomorrow. Haha keep in min I got a package from Sweden before I got a pacakage from domestic. Go figure.  Good stuff dude all in all n2p0 is legit I'm going to look into their other products the have to offer. Especially because they take cc. Honestly I think he's a great vendor.
RCSources,3a45go,All_Day88,2,Wed Jun 17 03:23:01 2015 UTC,"My flux order is coming tomorrow too!!  Scored three boxes of 50 from him for what would get me two boxes at east ugh.  Consern really needs to get back to me.  I'm waiting on samples from labtrade too...if I like those, I'll be buying bulk and saying fuck this domestic overpriced etizest...so we'll see.    I'm interested in trying clonazolam though for sure, as well as diclazolam and pyrazolam.  And whatever flub is the good one lol I need to do more research when I have time.    I'll keep an eye out for a full report from you when you can try the clon and nothing else   Edit: I ordered from flux last Wednesday and asked him to ship it late so it'd show up Monday (meaning Friday or Saturday) since I didn't want it sitting there all weekend and I get tracking on Monday that isn't updatin at all.  Doesn't even say the post office has the package, just that he printed a label.  Pretty sure he got it out last second Monday but whatever.  I expected to come home right before usps came Monday and thought it'd be there but nope.  All good though.  He's good people"
RCSources,3a45go,2piradians,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:27:20 2015 UTC,"I think yours is fine mine was like that too but started updating today. You'd think the dude would complete an ordering one day and send it out same day.  When you see 2-3 day shipping you expect it at your house in three days not three days after they finally complete the order.   But whatevs I'm in no rush just wanted to get a little benzo binge in before I get tired of it again. I get fed up with the memory loss and stay away for a couple months rinse, em repeat. I think 30 clonaz and 50etiz should be a fun month or so haha"
RCSources,3a45go,2piradians,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:39:55 2015 UTC,Oh yeah it finally updated and said it'll arrive tomorrow so I'm happy.  It should be a good week.  I have some MD from east coming Thursday.  I found out recently that I like those.  They work great if you have a full stomach or just need quick relief.  I was cutting them in half and dosing 2mg and got great effects.  I wish they were smaller though.  They need to be a lot smaller.  1mg pills meant to dissolve under your tongue should be tiny
RCSources,3a45go,happy_fart,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:44:24 2015 UTC,"Sheesh, I must be the only person around here who finds clonazolam more or less useless. That might have something to do with my 3mg a day flub-lam habit though."
RCSources,3a45go,2piradians,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:35:17 2015 UTC,Haha that might have a shit load to do with it. I've hear lots of reports of flam permanently frying your tolerance. Maybe 2-3mg of clonaz is what you need

Diclazopam or clonazolam would be much better.

They've never been anything special to me (even actual fent, never liked it) but then again I was a heroin addict for almost nine years.    U-47700 sounds interesting...thought about trying some out but I know if it even felt slightly good, it wouldn't end well so I stay away.  There are definitely a lot of vendors out there selling both though.  I'll check and see if I bookmarked any   The search engine works great though.  Search u-47700 or the fent ana and sort by new and check them out.  I know there's a big one that sells sprays   N2p0 I think it's called   http://www.n2p0.com/ Yup they have pfbf sprays. They had a lot more options last time i was there though   For what it's worth I've never used an rc opiate that's even held a match to the real thing (and this is back when the best fent analogues were easy to find.

I have experience with both and hated them though.  Horrible duration and not really euphoric.  Even banging em I wasn't satisfied.  Sold it off to a friend (NOT as heroin) that enjoyed it and got some actual dope and opana ir  Hated might be a strong word.  Disliked would be better.

RCSources,39y6qz,All_Day88,3,Mon Jun 15 19:41:29 2015 UTC,I dont think either butyr-fent or acetyl-fent are scheduled at the moment. Butyr was popular a month or two and not sure about acetyl but I cant find anything saying theyve since been scheduled. Do you have a link?  Either way I'd say your best bet of the lot is the pre-prepped nasal sprays of PFBF from N2P0 if the extra cost isnt too big an issue.

Legit euphoria, but still issues with duration.  Not good when it comes to opiates.

I completely forgot who it was I ordered from.  I remember emailing Spade and Space, and you mentioned Spade has it so I might have ordered from that person.  I think it's actual MXE, it was a reliable vendor, but I never have had experience with dissociatives. Is this really what they are like? I had a terrible time and just wanted it to go away. Why do people enjoy it so much? Everything was really blurry."

RCSources,39jire,amphoteric12,2,Fri Jun 12 11:31:30 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah it'd be very handy. We've taken 6-APB similar to this from buckledbonzi.com before, it was a white talc like powder, kind of clumpy. Had the same purple marquis result.. We dosed at 150mg and it produced a slightly stimulating high, it felt good, slightly serotenergic but it was mild which would indicate a low purity. Seemed to last a good while though.  This batch is somewhat slightly tanner if that means anything but the texture and consistency is the same. If 150mg produced a mild high in the past perhaps 250mg might bring us closer to full effects of 6-apb? Provided that's what it actually is of course"

RCSources,39axq5,Vanishedintheair,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:09:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, I have had some extremely euphoric experiences on DLL's A+ MXE. I got a batch right after the debacle of him selling B grade stuff, I got some a bit after which I gave out to people, and I luckily grabbed some right before he disappeared this last time. It can be very euphoric and I don't feel it had longer legs.   It hits me in the usual time MXE hits me, 30-60 minutes, it's always taken me a bit longer for onset. It lasts about 3-4 hours. The thing about DLL's is it can end in stimulation that lasts for an hour or two afterwards, which is exactly why I wanted to test it for purity.   I don't think it's MXP, but that's just my opinion, based on trying lots of different MXE. Anyway, hopefully in a few months it'll be cleared up.  ETA: I also don't think it's MXM, as DLL's MXE in the past two months has always had quite a bit of euphoria IME. I could be wrong, and it definitely happens more often than not.

RCSources,39axq5,Neur0doc,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:09:16 2015 UTC,"in terms of medicinal value, there could be some at low doses like you said <20mg doses.  Personally I find mxe HIGHLY addicting and if I get a lot, ill be shooting 500mg to 1000mg a day in no time. I can't put it down. This stuff can be worse then heroin adn cocaine for me in some ways (minus the withdrwaal aspect of heroin).  One value it definitely has is to help detox from opiates.. you need highish doses for this (50mg+) but you can have a heavy opiate habit and mxe with completely stave off withdrawals.  I have found mxe works exactly hte same on me if I am on the vivitrol shot (once a month injectable naltraxone) or off it. Naltraxone blocks the opiate recepters so it doesnt have any opiate affinity with typical full agonist opiate recepters, somehow it just kills teh withdrawals wihle your high on it. Great way to detox and have fun doing it.  When I am binging hard and doing 100mg shots multiple times a day, I do start to get negative side effects...which is to be expected. Beause after being abstinent my first 50mg shot will throw me into an mhole and ill be good for a few hours before wanting to redose."

I would fix the coupon prompt section during checkout before advertising it though... unless I totally just missed it (I looked thoroughly though).   I think it's a good chance for people (if they haven't) to get their feet wet and see that for a fraction of the price, (responsibly homemade) PG solutions are the way to go.   All in all, good luck!  Edit: spling"

I'm trying to figure out if my hunch is correct or not, about rcfor.me and their sender address being flagged by customs.  Another person here seemed to agree it's possible. Did you happen to order from the same vendor or different one?  Anyway, I'm through with overseas orders after this whole ordeal."
RCSources,39aifa,happy_fart,2,Thu Jun 11 22:03:55 2015 UTC,No I was debating ordering from then but I saw some unfavorable reviews and shit. I went with another Chinese vendor.

RCSources,39aifa,happy_fart,2,Fri Jun 12 04:21:03 2015 UTC,That pack is said and done haha. Having another one with bulk schedule 1 coming from china that I'm worried about. RCs are not scary at all compared to controlled
RCSources,39aifa,gay4baileyj,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:49:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Schedule I USA substances carry much more risk.  I'm genuinely interested in hearing how this plays out for you!  Thanks for always remembering to update/respond respectfully.  You're a gentle man and a scholar. Also, I have great news.  My rcfor.me reship arrived at my local post office today.  According to TN updates, it traveled erratically again, 4/5ths the globe, straight from Shanghai and through N.Y. Jamaica sorting facility, then through two different Maryland USPS sort facilities.  Eventually left Dulles international airport at Maryland ( yes I know there are two Dulles international airports), and from there straight to Hawaii where, just like Jamaica, N.Y., both have customs offices.  Fortunately, it arrived at my small home town USPS office and should be received at home with in 24 hours (unless something horribly goes wrong, lol).  Total days from reship until tomorrow, 8 days, not including weekends.  Edit:  simple question for any and all.  I thought all international packages are subject to USA  customs.  This package has had two chances of being forwarded to two various customs inspections, yet it didn't.  Not to mention the first shipment was most likely seized in San Francisco customs.  After three weeks of no response from  customs, and no love letter from uncle Sam, perhaps their computer systems are not as synched as previously suspected.  Maybe, there is a reason rcfor.me shipped from Shanghai to N.Y. Maybe they used a different return address and maybe packaging was more professional and stealth this second time around. So here's my kinda stupid question:  How many international packages from third world countries ( such as developing countries, with all due respect, i.e. inbound from   China, India, Pakistan and the likes) go though customs mandatory?    Aloha, Your friend, Happy."
RCSources,39aifa,happy_fart,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:52:10 2015 UTC,"All packages go through customs. I think China is just not scrutinized, lots of things come from China to the U.S.  With my package, it was labeled as a different chemical with a chemical inspection paper from China and it was not stealthed at all, just mbb. This was a $1600 order. It cleared customs in 5 hours though so I can't complain. Think it's safer that way for rcs  The postal system is fucked up alot. Did you use a 10 digit zip code? They bounce around a lot if they have a problem like that. Someone I sent a package gave me the wrong zip code and it's missing still 1 month later."
RCSources,39aifa,gay4baileyj,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:54:13 2015 UTC,"JUST GOT MINE!...Oh how.excited I am. The stealth was amazing, better than TMB!.. All label numbers coincided with each product.  I will now weigh, test and report.  I took dozens of pictures, from the freshly received box that I signed for and every aspects to the unpacking.  A black sharpie pen was used to blot out any critical information, including a lot of Chinese Characters. I planed recently, before receiving the package, that I'll do a one-thread review of all vendors dealt with so far (about five). But this I plan on making this rcfor.me gift the most elaborate review with dozens of pictures in a.separate thread.  All I need to do is test.  I'll start by making a really weak and small BF solution, incase the other two baggies are mislabeled.  Anyway I got a question for you all because I forgot to use an old digital  camera and without thinking used my smart phone camera. I never uploaded pictures to imgur or whatever before, but I'm scared of the data behind each uploaded picture, like exif data or something like that.  (I'm not very techy, rather hike, surf and garden). So do you have any advice before sharing with r/rcsources hence the world?  Edit: Thank you to everyone here. Sorry to the people I gave bad vibes to a few days ago in the Apostles thread. Aloha nui loa, all.  Edit two before I forget ( hehe hence the testing begins):  the first package seized in San Francisco customs had a 300mg 2fa gift.  Of course the reship didn't have the gift.  Understandable.  I'll just go domestic unless that new Canadian dude proves super duper legit).  Or if Infinity restocks soon.  Either way I'll be contacting Apostle and watching closely. Okay Pau Hana, time for cruise da couch.  Cheee!"

RCSources,39aifa,happy_fart,2,Wed Jun 10 14:00:47 2015 UTC,"You're a benzodiazepine too, nice meet you brother.  My China package has been stuck in San Francisco customs for nearly three weeks.  The vendor reshipped, but someone here brought up the fact that the sender's address may have been red flagged by customs.  I'm never going to buy overseas again, for all I know my address is red flagged too, if customs employs such technology which is plausible this day in age.  Sometimes I wonder if and how many LEO troll these subreddits to collect information/data.  Now that I think of it, they can probably figure out who I am based on I.P. and personal conversations on reddit.  It's difficult to gauge how connected computer technology is and how the authorities utilize such information."

It's 2015 and technology is insane.  Anyway I don't feel comfortable dealing with customs ever again, unless it's like some Ebay stuff.  The probability of future seizures is intimidating, and that's obviously what they want.  So buying from overseas is not only a risk, but playing into the enemies hands, either way.  :("

RCSources,39aifa,NothngIsFckedHereMan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:27:07 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Perhaps this stroke of bad luck during my first overseas purchase has permanently ruined any attempt at additional chances of getting my helpers through customs. In all honesty, I thought the liability would be low, because Hawai'i is half way between China and California.  I never expected the carriers to overshoot the islands and take it all the way to Cali, as I thought Hawaii would have it's own customs set up and such shipping patterns are unreasonably erratic."

Clonazolam is longer lasting, twice the potency and has stronger sedative and hypnotic effects.    They are my two favorites."
RCSources,399i2i,discobiscuits-,2,Wed Jun 10 20:42:07 2015 UTC,"Was sent 5 Tizor etizolam pellets as a sample, they arrived fairly quickly for first class shipping (They ship priority 2-3 day for actual orders domestic) The pellets came looking proffesionally pressed, not crumbly or anything with a split for halving in the middle.

RCSources,399i2i,HunchCanoe,2,Wed Jun 10 15:42:24 2015 UTC,"They are only on the avoid list because they added the name of their branded etizolam, which is called Tizor, to the wikipedia page to be alongside the other brands Etilaam, Etizola, Sedekopan, Etizest, Pasaden, and Depas.

Isn't it obvious that I wasn't praising Apostle, but genuinely thanking him and sharing some encouragement and positivity?  I have yet to order from him, but have watched his group orders grow into an actual website.  I've noticed time, effort and dedication which I wholeheartedly respect- again, not praise but an observation that I can relate to personally. At the same time I have noticed an unfair amount of negativity towards him.. And now towards me for merely encouraging a brother?  Is that justice?  This is a relatively small community, one about drugs and obtaining drugs which may or may not break the law.  In this game, justice has been and will always be dictated by those playing the game.  There are certain rules that remain unspoken, such as don't fuck with other people without good reason.  Maybe here it's known as retiquette.  Outside the context of the law, in which this forum remains grey, it's better known as street justice.  Of course, I'm not going to personally show up at your doorstep, but you get my drift.  I'm not a vendor, but it's obvious that there are legal risks to this game.  That deserves respect above all- again it's not something to be taken lightly or fucked with without good reason.  I merely ask that people show a bit of respect and kindness, have dialogue and try to educate one another. In return, they'll receive two fold the etiquette.  That said, if someone doesn't show respect, doesn't contribute any positivity and over all just cowardly attacks another, they too will be received with such courtesy."

Sometimes they do the calculation depending on your needed CAD output, but sometimes you have to give them a close USD ammount they do the conversion and you will know you still have to add a couple of more USD to reach the target CAD ammount. It can be tiresome because they have to cancel the order each time you do the calculation, but that is their job and their fault they do not know how to calculate (some times) your needed CAD output to USD."

They also claimed that they would do all the necessary research and even get a purity test if requested. However reviews of the site seemed to indicate they'd either take the money and send you a product that's 30-40% pure at best. So I was just trying to see if there were any reputable custom synthesis places that might do a better job at a somewhat decent price.

So 5 days to USD - that beats lots of  USA domestic shipping times; first class AND some priority.  He didn't actually include the bonus product unfortunately and i can't really bitch about free shit but I did just email him to ask him and of course compliment on shipping times (not really in his control however except he shipped when he said he would)

Your selling these in batches of up to 5k how many pellets do you have? Must be a house full lol What the heck are those 3 chemicals? Can't find much about them and what I have sounds very strange..    Looking forward to your reply :)
RCSources,38sb2n,ssteve631,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:54:08 2015 UTC,"I don't mind at all.    No it is not. What gives you this impression? This batch was only 100,000 pellets. I am a very small vendor, this is how I am able to maintain a high level of product and service quality.     GHRP-2 = Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide 2 Selank = A nootropic peptide Alpha Arbutin = A melanin inhibitor   If anyone remembers that a user posted here about misusing the product and claiming it was low quality? He emailed me demanding a refund, but instead of refund him I paid to have that very same batch tested again, a process which is over 10x more expensive than simply complying to his demands. Well after the test results got back it appears that the Etizolam is still >99% pure! Test1 Test2 Test3 - New Batch ... Fuck shady customers..."

RCSources,38l3iz,GaelicReaum,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:22:34 2015 UTC,"No problem. Thanks for the excellent experience. I will order again and review again. If there are any other sites you would like to be reviewed on please let me know and I will. Safe or scam I should review on I suppose.   Also if you could stock some quality chems to replicate the ""borax"" formula I would definitely order that semi frequently also. I'm on mobile so can't look it up but it will pop up on Google from a reddit users post. It almost perfectly simulates a very popular chemical people would take at a rave. Its basically 5-mapb, 2fma, and one of the 4-something-something tryptamines. I think if you had all of those in stock or as a kit it would be very popular if you advertised it. Just an idea as I am currently trying to source these, as others I'm sure. Maybe ill email you to give you the exact tryptamine etc. Thanks much for providing an outstanding service. Hope you keep at it! The clonazolam is excellent quality."

If you wanted to do that, you should have deducted the total amount that you have measured out from the bag over time which would leave you with 'X' amount stuck to the bag. Even then you're assuming that the vendor put exactly 'Y' amount of the 4-AcO-DMT in the bag in the first place.  Instead, you could cut open the sides of the bag and scrape off the remainder of the powder with a credit card. This is the way I do it and it works pretty well for me."

Like an absolute idiot, I took 4 ""minuscle"" shots of 190 proof everclear after meticulously transferring the contents from the bottle to waterbottles for my friends.  I can handle my shit after two shots of 70 proof rum, but on this occasion the intoxication was truly unlike anything I've ever experienced (and I'm not stranger to drinking large quantities of diluted liquor). My poor condition had me extremely concerned. I was piss drunk within 10 minutes, couldn't even stand up. I passed out two hours later and woke up fine.

I've never heard of the only effects being extreme body load for one hour, and then back to baseline. There was effectively no psychedelia (in the sense I know it) during most of the ""trip.""  If the experience had been milder, I'd still be advising caution.  And yes, I recognize that everyone responds to substances differently.

However, I have never heard of any psychoactive chemical SOLELY producing body load.

I know the body load feeling, it doesn't take long to go away but time feels way slower so an hour feels like the entire evening. I also got the tears your talking about too but I wasn't sure if they were from the drug or from the times I started at lights, or just from laughing so hard I was crying. I'm pretty sure the tears were from laughing I like couldn't even handle how funny shit was. All around that stuff is really good in my opinion."

RCSources,38keiz,RxDealer,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:11:38 2015 UTC,Same thing happen to a friend of mine with there 4-aco-dmt. The chems effect didn't seem right at all.
RCSources,38keiz,RxDealer,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:48:09 2015 UTC,"Bad idea not to measure your dose, but I've taken doses from 15mg to 100mg (yes, really) and the 100mg dose was an amazing experience.  I also had a reeeeallly bad time on 30mg.    The issue with this substance, imho, is that the experiences are quite variable and you 100% cannot attempt to direct the experience in anyway.  It's best to sit back, close your eyes, pop on some calming music and keep benzos or a bottle of wine ready if you experience anxiety at any point.  I've never had issues with mushrooms in the same way I have with 4-ACO-DMT, but my best experience with 4-ACO-DMT kicks the ass of mushrooms.   I think that the reason for the difference from mushrooms and the variability is the likelihood that 4-ACO-DMT is an active compound that is metabolized into another active compound (psilocin and god knows what else).  I have insufflated and the experience was far different, which I attribute to bypassing first-pass metabolism and changing the cmax of pcilocin.  Any slight alteration in your metabolism of the substance, could result in a varying experience.  Whereas, with mushrooms you have pcilosibin (a mainly inactive compound) being metabolized into pcilosin (a very active compound) so the effects of one are all that really matter.   P.S. Don't do 100mg like I did.  I think I was trying to punish myself when I did this and I'm really lucky it turned out the way it did. If it had gone in the other direction, I can't even imagine how bad it would have been because it practically stopped time for me. I remember closing my eyes while listening to Darkside's ""Great Gig In The Sky"" during what felt like hours only to open my eyes briefly to realize that I was only halfway through the same song. A minute and a half had passed, if that."

RCSources,389n7z,HunchCanoe,2,Wed Jun 3 02:09:10 2015 UTC,"Search knborganics and pass their test. Prices are high but because it's a church, they are locally and federally protected by law to sell sacraments (mxe, in two variants, being one of them). I've been a member for two years (senior level) and that's when you can start ordering larger amounts. There are limits on how much can be ordered in a time frame. 5 mapb available too (and very pure). Been working with them for years, you order on a Monday, and it's shipped Tuesday (barring any crazy health issues or storefront problems). Do not spread this far and wide, he can only handle so many customers. All mxe is shipped in 25 mg doses."

Even IF he ships out and gets you the said material you are looking for, his whole religious angle is exceedingly dangerous and stupid. It's great that he does seem to get packages out, but there is absolutely no way this defense would work!  Just look up how many cases have actually won based on the religion defense. I can name one, and that's Santo Daimo. Even the Church of the Inner Light has never actually had to defend it's sacrament in court. How many Rastas have tried this defense and won?    Please, even if you want to play with fire and buy from him, don't spread that around. Not because it's such a great, hidden secret, but because it's incredibly stupid and naive to think anything that guy says will fly in the face of the American justice system."

He told me yes there is pressure, but he has actually sued Louisiana over his rights to create a church that provides these services and he is on the 'winning"" side. Again, I understand your views, but I've had 2 day shipping, responsible amounts of compounds sent, exams to complete, and moved up in the church. The architecture of the church is well thought out, and the feds/local government refuses to touch him because of religious protections in Louisiana. It's different state to state for a reason.   Anyway, nothing but positive for me, and the last two years has been consistent. It's up to the readers on this board to choose what they think is best for them. They offer BTC and bank transfer.   No I'm not a shill, but knb was my intro to the rc scene, and he taught me responsibility and respect for all psychoactive compounds. I appreciate your response and respect your opinion, but I'll recommend a vendor that has treated me well in the past with no hesitation. You have to pass a tucking test to just get in, and I promise you, if you don't study you will fail  That's enough if my rant.

I always err on the side of caution, and the religious argument has very little chance of holding up to scrutiny, in my opinion. We're already skirting the edges with the not for human consumption angle. This looks like another Webtryp waiting to happen.

If anything I thought the towa Migjt be a tad weak because of the price compared to the depas.  Now I'm thinking the depas will be exactly 1mg while the towa are a little stronger maybe due to lab standards or something.  No idea really.    If anyone has tried the towa sublingual let me know.  They're kind of small, and I was planning on cutting one in half and trying it sublingual for the hell of it incase I just ate.

Please update me on how they are vs the towa brand.  Only reason I ordered them was to up the total I could order and because I was curious about the price difference.  Nice pay check last week so why not.    Hoping I get a tracking email soon...maybe it was delayed because they were busy who knows.  But once it's shipped I know I'll have it within a week
RCSources,386ltq,GetHyyer,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:15:37 2015 UTC,I did! I did the same my first order because of the 90 limit. I will definitely know about the sublingual effects very shortly - was starving after work so I had a decent sized plate of lasagna and then did 2mg sublingually. Curious as to the difference ingesting them that way versus orally as well as if that bypasses a full stomach.   Let me know how that shipping goes! I may be re-ordering again soon.
RCSources,386ltq,filterbubble,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:56:03 2015 UTC,"I always used to sub my kpins.  They seemed like they were meant for it lol dissolved so quickly and tasted great.  Even the white 2mg were completely dissolved super quick.    The towa are about the same size as the 2mg kpin from memory, but I have a feeling they won't dissolve as quickly because of the coating.  Let me know!    Sublingual works amazingly though from my experience.  It's a shame the etizest MD have been reported to be weaker or I would buy some in case I need super quick results or just ate a meal.  Seems like the etiz is wasted completely if you take it within 30 mins after eating even a medium amount of food which sucks.    This is the only thing that makes me consider a pg solution.  But I don't want to mix it up myself.  I might just buy a bottle pre mixed for this very reason since the MD brands suck.  Unless the towa or depas dissolve quickly.  We'll see.

RCSources,385hov,preference,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:24:41 2015 UTC,"I'm tired of waiting for DLL, but I still trust him.  Besides, his prices for domestic stuff are the lowest I've found.  $55 for a gram of etiz and $15 for a 100mg PG solution. flubromazelam was the same price if I'm not mistaken, in fact during his sale event I think the grams of FLam became cheaper than $55.  I mean the prices are just downright unbeatable, especially yet regardless that he's domestic, for over seas sales always have a chance of getting pinched by US customs and over seas prices are higher for the most part. I'm praying he'll come back and get his operations running smoothly again.  Hell, I ran my own business for over four years, roughing it solo every day  of the week without fail and holding down the fort all alone.  A person can burn out easy working  that hard, and part of me feels he's in the same boat that I once was. Also, think of how hard he had to work and money he's invested to build not only a solid reputation, but a large clientele who, I assume, gnaws at the bit daily by visiting his page twice a day (guilty of that myself). Once I read here on rcsources that DLL is in this businesses because he genuinely likes selling rcs.  Everything I've witnessed suggests that is most likely the case.  After all, he's not gouging his customers and is still probably making 8-10x profit even after selling his products for amazingly unbeatable prices.  Here's my math, and please feel free to correct me of I'm wrong, or simply chime in: 1 kilogram of etiz from China or India maybe costs him $3-$5k.  That's a mere $3-$5 per GRAM! He's able to flip that kilo, legally, for over $50k. Yet he remains (or remained) the least expensive vendor with the most large following. Would he, even would you, give up so much?... All that hard work and sweat, all that profit, so easily?  Meanwhile, trusted domestic vendors like qualityetizolamusa probably are buying kilos for roughly the same price, instead turning $3-5k into $150,000.  One hundred fifty thousand mother fucking dollars profit!    I feel ripped off, yet happy that I no longer need the streets and that whole scene (y'all know what I mean) only to pay $5.00 for a xanny bar, or $3.00 for a damn Valium. So that said, I really can't complain.  But turning $5k into $150k is impressive as it is frustrating to me. Makes me think, if my businesses didn't go bankrupt and I still had the cash, I could use my India/Pakistan connections (spent years there)  to somehow get a few kilos shipped out here to the US, and follow in DLLs footsteps.  I think our domestic community needs it right now. Edit: spelling."

One seized shipment, one raid, and that ""150 grand"" is down the shitter.   By the way, not starting an argument - you are 100% correct, but it's the price you pay for delivery instead of finding a source locally who may be a shifty shit. A friend I know was ripped off getting ""real"" drugs today, and I haven't had that occur yet once.

RCSources,386obj,galmse,3,Tue Jun 2 10:34:54 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly reliable.  As of now they are having trouble with Credit Cards, so you have to use Western Union, the process of them picking the money up from the moment you send it can take up to two days. When using Credit Card this waiting stage is ZERO.   Once they have the money and approve the buy then they ship that very same day. The Xpress shipping, in my experience, consistently takes 3 days to arrive. It is supposed to take 3 working days, but I have gotten a package sent a Friday and arrive a Monday. I live in Southest USA.   I have never tried regular shipping, I understand it does work for the US, but it is not insured as far as I know, so I doubt they will replace a lost regular parcel, but again I do not know.  Xpress is well worth the extra money, their prices are already more than fair for an American vendor.  My recommendation, considering Western Union and Xpress Shipping fees, is to buy as much as you can at once in order for these fees to be less than 10% of the actual product's price.  Regarding shipping, it is quite discrete and unassuming, and it contains all the legal documentation, remember you are not buying anything illegal, but it does have to comply with regulations. The company is professional and complies with regulations (e.g. safety sheets, etc)."

There were documented cases of people consistently having bellow average experiences with a particular batch of 4-AcO-MET, and BCLS was swift to acknowledge the issue and make up for their customers; they also stated the fact on their front page and they are actually selling the degraded batch at a super low price.   You make it sound like you opinion is enough of a basis to discredit a company that has consistently surpass every customer's expectation, except maybe with regards to their communication which can be slow if you need personalized attention.

As soon as you have any confirmations you see it on the status page, at 3 confirmations your coins tumble and are sent to the wallet of your choice in less than 30 minutes.  you get fresh bitcoins, not just another tumbler users coins."

I'm not doing anything illegal and really just want to use BTC to shop with RC vendors, because that's what most of them accept.  As a side question, assuming there's a version of helix I could use.  Would you recommend I buy the coins on Coin.Mx then send them to helix, then from there send them directly to a separate wallet?  If so, what would you recommend as my final wallet?  I'm sorry for asking you to basically hold my hand but this stuff is very intimidating for the uninitiated and I don't want to go to jail or see my limited funds frozen for doing something that is within the bounds of the law."
RCSources,37vcyb,footlockervip,2,Tue Jun 2 14:43:56 2015 UTC,"even though the RC's are legal in my opinion you still have reason to tumble. First of all what happened with circle can theoretically happen with any btc exchange. They have to protect them self from illegal, illicit, and high risk activity.  Take my advice, do not go searching for a clearnet tumbler and send your BTC into it, most are scams.  Are you sending the BTC to a persons private wallet? If so you could probably just send straight from coin.mx without a problem. Tumbling is an extra step in your operational security.   The reason youd want to tumble would be to protect your self if the vendor did go down (which many RC vendors do). You may think what your doing is perfectly legal becuase your not buying for human consumption but thats not how the government sees it. RC dealers are arrested all the time. This has been happening since 2004.  As a buyer you are generally a lot more safe.  The reality of it is this. Depending who the recipient is of your BTC, your btc exchange may choose to shut you down or freeze your account. That is less likely with coin.mx then with the bigger guys like circle, etc..  Tumbling through helix light costs 3%. Its a nominal fee for peace of mind.  Tor is extremely easy to use. In fact it is basically a 2 step process.   copy and paste this address into your search bar https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en   click to download the bundle. unzip it if windows or drag it to your desktop if mac.   double click to open the tor browser   Thats it, that browser is tor. you now have access to any hidden web service. and site you visit in that window will be anonymous for you as well as your IP is masked.  This is the address for helix light http://grams7enufi7jmdl.onion/helix/light  copy and paste that into your TOR browser window you now have open. check my next message for instctions how to use helix light"
RCSources,37vcyb,footlockervip,2,Tue Jun 2 15:34:11 2015 UTC,"This is only necessary IF you decide youw ant to tumble  create a blockchian online wallet (this is the blockchain service related to btc)  https://blockchain.info/wallet  ok, you downloaded the tor browser bundle, instealled it.  Now you double clicked to open it, all it is is a web browser like google chrome or internet explorer. you can go to only difference is you can navigate to .onions as well.  paste this address for helix light http://grams7enufi7jmdl.onion/helix/light  paste in your blockchain wallet, this is where the tumbled coins will be sent  then it will give you a deposit address where you need to SEND your bitcoins to. This is the wallet address you give coin.mx to direct the coins to helix light.  viola, watch teh status screena dn get clean coins in 30 mins.  The nice thing is now you can browse ALL the hidden marketplaces to buy rc's and drugs  https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/wiki/superlist is a trustworthy list you can use for adresses to paste into your onion browser.  and if you decide to send straight from coin.mx to your vendor you'll probably be fine.. but what vendor are you using? part of what matters is how high traffic they are which can be a determining factor i youw atn to tumble."

RCSources,37rvgk,drugsuser,1 point,Fri May 29 23:01:46 2015 UTC,"I feel ya. But his AL-LAD used to be 100ug, and now it's 125ug. Most AL-LAD that's sold (like from LL) is 150ug. Like you said, he probably lays his own blotters of AL-LAD.  On the other hand, his 1p-LSD is 100ug, which is the only dosage I've seen it sold (again, like from LL). So I'm hoping that his current batch of 1p-LSD is just from a bulk supply of pre-laid blotters he got from a reliable source.

You won't be vaping all of this at once so don't worry. Just keep vaping until you feel like you're where you want to be.   Heat underneath the foil with a lighter about 1-2"" inches away. The a-PHP will turn into a clear liquid. Take the heat away and let it cool down. After the clear liquid goes back to normal, heat it the same way, maneuver it around the foil, and chase the vapor with a straw or hollowed out pen. It smells and tastes kind of gross at first, but you'll get used to it. Just be careful with the heat, you don't want to burn it. Once it turns dark brown/black it's done."

RCSources,37njse,Chemical-Alex,14,Thu May 28 23:10:47 2015 UTC,"Since nobody else felt like letting them know I thought I would go ahead and explain a bit about the proposed law ans what it looks like now.  Currently the law appears to only apply to substances intended for human consumption that do not fit the categories for exemption (foods, etc..).  The purpose of the law is to take the enforcement of legal highs away from the MHRA and Trading Standards and into the hands of the Police and Crown Prosecution Service (which is where it should be).  I think the purpose is to really just go after headshops specifically. As well as lay the foundations for a new kind of drug law which we will be lucky to see much of yet.  What will be interesting to see will be:     - What are the boundaries for what is ""Psychoactive"" or not     - How substances that have not been tested in humans are treated     - How a ""guilty until proven innocent"" approach will work in reality for this     - How they expect to prove ""intent to supply"" in such cases (are they really only going for the big distributors?)     - Are we getting closer to a system where drugs are controlled based on their harms ?     - How the government will prevent their crudely patched together blanked ban from covering harmless substances like food supplements (and will they? We do live in the country that makes Vitamin B12 a prescription only medicine lol), or from restricting legitimate chemical companies from operating properly     - Are we moving towards a more regulated system altogether? The wholesale medicine distribution license was made a hell of a lot easier to get last April - any layman can get involved  All in all I think its quite a good law.

RCSources,37njse,LABTRADE,1 point,Fri May 29 19:28:54 2015 UTC,"You have read it wrong. It has to be intended for human consumption AND produce a psychoactive effect.

Thing is if it is only going to affect ""for human consumption"" RC products/vendors, I don't see why anyone really cares too much about the scope of this. I would really want some more input before I relax...  I did read several places say it won't be an offence to possess, so surely even if it is a ""legal high"" of the ""for human consumption"" variety one could just order it from another country? Assuming they are representing the bill accurately..."
RCSources,37njse,LABTRADE,1 point,Fri May 29 19:59:19 2015 UTC,"Its not badly worded, it is actually very specific. Yes this law is not much to care about.  Importation is covered illegal even if it is for your own use (personal possession)."
RCSources,37njse,theskepticalidealist,1 point,Fri May 29 22:03:01 2015 UTC,"You do know that everyone is saying it doesn't just cover ""for human consumption"" use right? Did you see that David Nutt interview saying this would ""destroy brain research"" in the UK because now any psychoactive substance is illegal? Where he complains that if he wants to import some substance for (actual) research he would have to wait a year and a half for approval even if it's not a specifically scheduled drug. Everywhere I see saying the same thing, so it seems pretty clear this is about saying everything is illegal unless you're on their exceptions list. So regardless of whether a substance is marked ""for human consumption"" it will be illegal by default because it's ""psychoactive"".   The whole point of the law is to stop new RCs coming in and them needing to blacklist the new ones. If it meant what you say it means it would change next to nothing except for street smoke shops.  In the old rules it was seen as everything's legal until they blacklist it. With this it changes to everything being illegal unless they create an exemption for it.  I didn't want it to be this either but after furious googling I am struck with the reality that this will be the end of RCs (as well as stuff like Kava and Kratom) in the UK.   When places start shutting up shop there will be mass sales and everyone will try and stock up. I recommend planning ahead, maybe get in there early and then grab some good deals at the end... Then maybe Darknet might start to developed some more. After all a multi million (billion?) £ industry is going up in smoke especially as this will likey spread to almost all the western nations"

Research on the human brain often requires human consumption of a psychoactive compound, hence why this law would restrict research.

RCSources,37ldty,IMG_9999,1 point,Thu May 28 16:08:22 2015 UTC,"Well it seems like a majority of the problems are only with orders that included MXE.

This time I ordered two bottles of clonazolam solution, and it was again probably about 5 days until I received it. I think I may have gotten lucky and snagged him at a good time, but regarding the mxe if he is having problems with his supplier or something and is trying to get it resolved he may not want to worry anybody with an announcement about it and he just wants to get it resolved on his own without being harrassed.   24 days is a pretty long period of time, and I haven't tried to contact him via email so I can't comment on that, but I fully support him and say to give him the benefit of the doubt, he may just being experiencing some sort of problems that he does not want to share with the public. I'd just keep trying to contact him via his email and explain your situation and see if you can get a response from him, he really is swamped with all the orders he receives considering he's running a one man job from what I hear, so it's quite possible he somehow overlooked your order or something of the sort.

I'm starting to think this pattern isn't just about business, it might be about safety. Anyway it's one way to rationalize it..   Last this happened i got notice of shipping very late at night, so maybe it'll happen again. I think I'll save my worry for the weekend and find another source if necessary.

It's a little hard to pin down a source, but I've recently been dealing with purposechem.com and they've been exceedingly helpful and communicative. Only ""problem"" is a minimum order of 5g for $125  3-MeO-PCP is great as well, but I'm sill following tracking on my order and it hasn't left for the states yet (this is from lsresearchchemlab). I've also heard bad things about people's China to US packages getting stuck or left in customs for a long time, but LS offers 100% reship in the case of customs issues.  If you're in a bigger hurry to get a dissociative, go with purposechem. Or maybe DLL if they really do come back tomorrow with MXE in stock. Otherwise go to purposechem. Infinitychems is supposed to have MXE in at a really awesome price too, but got knows when that'll be."

It's the weirdest thing at high doses, but it's always euphoric, and music sounds amazing. I like to put on disasterpeace's Fez OST, and just drift off into other dark worlds.  I love MXE so much I abused it regularly at extremely high doses plugged and IM'd, so now, what a normal person takes orally to get into the M-Hole (70-100mg), I need to take intramuscularly to catch a strong buzz. You'll like it, just heed my advice and don't take too much too often, or you might never get the magic back"
RCSources,37c3o1,hypherism,2,Tue May 26 21:10:23 2015 UTC,"For the sake of safety, YES, invest in a gemini 20 scale off amazon. It's $20.  For the sake of your enjoyment get a milligram scale. 20mg can mean the difference between a nice M-Hole, and a catatonic state you won't remember any bit of. And once you blackout on MXE, you might be unfortunate enough to find the rest of your stash ""missing"" the next morning :P   Especially if you ever plug, IM, or use potent chemicals like the 2-C chems or 3-MeO-PCP you're going to need a mg scale."

RCSources,37c3o1,Frehaz,1 point,Wed May 27 18:00:08 2015 UTC,Yeah. I only ordered 5g cos it was a better deal. They do have a 1 gram listing for $50. Ask about samples too if you're interested in any of their other products.
RCSources,37c3o1,hypherism,4,Wed May 27 18:23:20 2015 UTC,"Check out 3-Meo-PCP.  I've heard many good things about it, and was thinking of ordering some soon.  Experience reports categorize it as being a bit more metallic than mxe or k but definitely on track to being a classic disso.  I believe they have it stocked on lsresearchchemlab.com at around 50 a gram.  Might be worth grabbing a milligram scale though, dosage can be quite low and I wouldn't want to mess with eyeballing something like that."
RCSources,37c3o1,CRaMaX,2,Thu May 28 03:52:46 2015 UTC,"I've tried 3-MeO-PCP & MXE and found them to be nothing alike, MXE possibly being my all time favorite chemical and the PCP being an experience tried twice and wish to never repeat. For me, MXE is only describable as the trifecta between Ketamine + LSD + Opiates all within the single drug, extreme euphoria and visions with a bit of PCP style 'mania' thrown in - amazing stuff. 3-MeO-PCP on the other hand was a 6 hour headache of clouded thoughts with euphoria replaced with an unpleasant stimulation where nothing felt comfortable and i felt to need to move constantly; there was some strange thought patterns but nothing notable - was unable to sleep it off either and had to wait out the entire duration. Normal MXE dose 30-80mg either insufflated or plugged and my two PCP doses were 10mg once insufflated once sublingual with identical effects.  MXE was unknown supplier via darknet purchase, 3-MeO-PCP was from  deboralabs product appeared very clean and pure was fine white fluffy crystal. Anyone else had an experience like this?"
RCSources,37c3o1,lapernap44,1 point,Thu May 28 06:46:50 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of in the same boat.  MXE probably my favorite chemical.  Have tried 3-meo a few times, I think it's quite a bit different from MXE, less warm and friendly, more likely to have a somewhat unpleasant time; but certainly has some redeemable qualities.    How does your MXE plugging go?  You mix it in water?  I've only ever eaten, sublingual and insufflated.  How does the experience differ?"
RCSources,37c3o1,WightLightY,2,Tue May 26 15:30:13 2015 UTC,Plugging was the strongest of all ROA's i have tried and would repeat again for sure. Just mixed in with ~6-8ml water it dissolved pretty quickly at room temp.
RCSources,37c3o1,lapernap44,1 point,Wed May 27 02:00:01 2015 UTC,"Off topic, but what is a very safe dose for a first time MXE user? And what is a good price per unit of product?"
RCSources,37c3o1,TheNarcissisticIdiot,2,Wed May 27 04:09:40 2015 UTC,"Really they're all pretty safe, as I don't think you could do any serious harm with MXE.  But I'd start with 10-15 mg either insufflated, under your tongue, or swallowed in a capsule.    The price of MXE seems to be going up as it becomes less available.  A good price per unit is purely subjective, but I'd have no problem paying $40-50 for a gram of quality MXE.  There seem to be some good options in the $25-35 range currently."

RCSources,37c3o1,TheNarcissisticIdiot,1 point,Wed May 27 20:53:42 2015 UTC,"BTC is pretty simple.  I'd recommend opening an account on circle to get your BTC.  You could also do localbitcoins.  The vendor will give you a BTC address to send the funds to, then you generally let him know when you do that.  If you get your bitcoin from an online exchange (like circle is), be sure to move your coins to a few different wallets (or tumble them), before you send it to the vendor's wallet.  Don't send directly from your circle wallet to the vendor."

And they let me keep the half sheet of al lad. That is pretty good customer service considering they aren't going to be doing retail business or shipping to the US  anymore and they had no reason not to tell me to go fuck myself or just not send it.

RCSources,373yx1,dh888,4,Sun May 24 19:16:34 2015 UTC,Tryptamines are not the most stable compounds when stored outside a freezer.
RCSources,373yx1,roionsteroids,3,Sun May 24 20:28:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip, I'll throw the rest of my tryptamines in the freezer. Up until now they'd been stored in a light-proof bag in a dark spot."
RCSources,373yx1,dh888,3,Sun May 24 21:47:41 2015 UTC,"Anything can be kept in a freezer.  For optimal storage of basically any compound, you want a cold, dark, and dry place. Airtight too."

RCSources,3736ff,Dyecraze,5,Sun May 24 13:06:21 2015 UTC,Says the mxe is out of stock. This would be nice though. Seems every us source is out of mxe right now.
RCSources,3736ff,Neur0doc,4,Sun May 24 14:40:38 2015 UTC,I ordered some clonazolam yesterday morning I'll let you guys know if it shows up/how it is when it comes
RCSources,3736ff,wtstalin,2,Sun May 24 20:50:42 2015 UTC,"Well, they have MXE, so they have piqued my interest. If someone goes for it please report back on the quality! Considering the relatively low price I would assume it is not the highest quality..."
RCSources,3736ff,be_it_known,1 point,Sun May 24 14:38:24 2015 UTC,Unfortunately our we are currently out of stock of MXE. We will be getting some in the next few weeks and the quality of it will be A+ crystal.
RCSources,3736ff,InfinityChems,2,Sun May 24 20:14:55 2015 UTC,i just posted a review. they're def legit with good shipping times and quality cLam.  i can't speak to other products yet. shipping was 23-26 - not bad esp for memorial day weekend and a sunday thrown in there just to slow it down a little more.
RCSources,3736ff,drimilr,2,Tue May 26 20:34:16 2015 UTC,Did you ever get your order?
RCSources,3736ff,Vanishedintheair,2,Fri May 29 04:21:58 2015 UTC,Just curious bout shipping times. I need to make sure my order is before and after a very specific time. Reason? Ppl im living with will be outta town n if the order shows up when they get back they'll get all paranoid bout wat im buying etc... a real headache. So im curious if u guys have sn average shipping time? Im im in Midwest of the u.s...  Thanks!! Hope to order soon!  :)
RCSources,3736ff,strangeflow,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:38:28 2015 UTC,"I ordered some clonazlom last afternoon. I will let you know. I sure hope its not a scam. The website is built very nicely ordered pretty easy with a nice checkout. Option to bill one address and ship to another which I have noticed some sites don't. Pay with btc or a few others, checkout used coin payments.com would love for this to be a decent site for rec benzos. Eastnootropics was super reliable but just too expensive with no bulk discount. But you can some great quality etizolam from concern in 3 days priority shipping. Sig required though."

RCSources,3736ff,Neur0doc,1 point,Sun May 24 19:29:50 2015 UTC,Unfortunately at this time we are only accepting Crypto Currencies.

RCSources,3736ff,DustBunnyMN,2,Sun May 24 23:50:34 2015 UTC,We would like to thank you for your order and I can assure we are not a scam. We have already shipped out a decent number of orders so everyone should be seeing some reviews shortly. Then I believe everyone will be able to order with confidence.

RCSources,374dn1,monalisafacial,2,Wed May 27 11:21:26 2015 UTC,"opiate fans tend to like to get their product quick. if personal experience is worth anything, i'm worried about my fix today, not tomorrow's fix.  side note: i am no longer worried about getting fixes, thank god!"
RCSources,374dn1,drimilr,2,Wed May 27 20:05:59 2015 UTC,Full Disclosure: Opiate Addict here. I tend to just source from around town while I await the package. Although I bet we give the Postal Delivery people and extra extended version of the waiting out the window stink eye
RCSources,374dn1,monalisafacial,1 point,Wed May 27 21:04:10 2015 UTC,"yeah i would too if i were still active. however where i live, local sourcing is near impossible. lots of cities have it, but i dont own a car and dont hang with other opiate users so an hour drive just is impossible."

RCSources,37300a,luckie_c,2,Sun May 24 11:39:17 2015 UTC,"I second this guy! Was expecting two weeks and took 9 days, gave me a few extra pellets and seems to be one of the few to ship clonazolam to the USA."
RCSources,37300a,awall621,1 point,Tue May 26 15:38:05 2015 UTC,Have yet to try the clonazolam.  I had no issues with stealth and it came quickly. I enjoyed the Hexedrone they have.  My only problem with it is the lack of information available on this chem.  Not many experience reports.   I'm having a hard time with the Parafluorobutyrfentanyl (PFBF) spray 250 x 0.6mg.  It may just be my tolerance issues but I notice nothing when I spray each nostril once.  It has the potential to be so dangerous that I'm not about to keep spraying till something happens.  I read that one spray could be the difference between a nice nod and dropping out.  If I order PFBF again anywhere I'll stick to powder so I can make my own solution.
RCSources,37300a,Xx-DeepBlueC-xX,1 point,Mon May 25 04:02:10 2015 UTC,"no, no no, do two or three sprays, i am low tolerance too. it worked perfect.it's so diluted that a spray wont kill you  otherwse.. i'll take it.... pm."
