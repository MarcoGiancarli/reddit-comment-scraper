dyinglight,3dos5n,lifeisabeach63,2,Sat Jul 18 00:45:56 2015 UTC,Yes more or less. There is a perk that will make it random on if the repair will use up a slot.
dyinglight,3dos5n,SolidAegis,2,Sat Jul 18 01:04:30 2015 UTC,It seems super stressful at first but as the game progresses I find that you're getting so many weapons that you don't even use all the repairs before finding better stuff.
dyinglight,3dos5n,breadcrumb123,2,Sat Jul 18 03:25:59 2015 UTC,"oh okay cool. Yea the first time I tried this game I got stuck on 'Siblings'. I was just kinda playing the game casually, not really thinking or collecting items from my surroundings. and I think I basically had shit weapons and most of them were broken. so I got killed everytime by Rais's mens.  So I kinda gave up (was only playing for a few weeks while on break from grad school). Now its summer and I started a new game and have more time, i've been collecting items and crafting, etc etc.  I made this short knife w electricity. holy cow. I was just doing the siblings mission and freaking rekt all of Raiss men w that electric knife. Felt so good. I'm taking a break now, still haven't technicaly finished the mission. gotta get the bolter sample"

dyinglight,3dod2n,drunkhoboboy117,3,Fri Jul 17 22:32:45 2015 UTC,That depends on if you have dups in both your carry and your stash. Like two sets of lock picks one on you and a set in your bag. If that is the case then you will lose alot.
dyinglight,3dod2n,SolidAegis,2,Sat Jul 18 01:06:54 2015 UTC,"It is not permanent, no. It only moves all the stuff you have into your stash."
dyinglight,3dkggo,CheesyJeevesYT,6,Fri Jul 17 00:11:34 2015 UTC,Yeah I found one too http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=482891625 I got it off the first guy I've seen with a gun he was in the slums at that gas station where you roll the bodies over looking for keys. Not sure why it's more powerful but I haven't found any rifle to come close to it's damage.
dyinglight,3dkggo,JaggedJosh,3,Fri Jul 17 00:54:58 2015 UTC,YES THATS IT!  The guy on the roof right?
dyinglight,3dkggo,JaggedJosh,2,Fri Jul 17 07:49:51 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's him. wonder if that gun always spawns with him."
dyinglight,3dkggo,DarthSnoopyFish,2,Fri Jul 17 08:14:45 2015 UTC,This is the only spot where you can get that powerful police rifle. I accidentally sold mine so I started a new game and spent a few hours grinding my power up then went to that police station. Got the same gun again and transfered it to my main character.
dyinglight,3dkggo,Shizrah,2,Fri Jul 17 09:23:13 2015 UTC,"Same I use. It's the only gun I've ever used simply because I like the ""tap-tap"" insta-kill."
dyinglight,3dkggo,Danielmjames,3,Fri Jul 17 06:55:41 2015 UTC,I found one (1) in the entire game that was a decent bit higher than the standard police rifle. I never found out why but I held on to it.

Instead, take this time to explore the arena and grab all the loot from the 3 or 4 chests scattered around. You don't have to continue or worry about time until you press the button on the container. There's two pistols in two different chests and an extra shotgun, I believe. As well as various firecrackers and throwables."

dyinglight,3dj94w,Iyagovos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:55:49 2015 UTC,So you'r saying there's no fix for this?
dyinglight,3dj94w,TaintedSquirrel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:25:11 2015 UTC,Turn the draw distance as low as possible.  You can also edit the CFG to go even lower than the slider allows.  What's your draw distance set to right now?
dyinglight,3dj94w,Riddla26,-1,Thu Jul 16 21:49:13 2015 UTC,Every thing is maxed right know cuz I know I can handle anything but these random fps drops r killing me.  But I'll try it and see if it'll stop
dyinglight,3dj94w,Riddla26,3,Thu Jul 16 21:54:12 2015 UTC,"Every thing is maxed right know cuz I know I can handle anything   No, you can't. I have twin R9 280X's and GTAV automatically maxed itself out and runs at a constantly solid 60fps (well, until the last patch). Dying Light I have to turn down mostly because Crossfire is insanely broken. Drop the distance slider. Over 50% it's basically redundant and all it does is load more textures into memory. Also turn off motion blur because it's damn annoying and a big performance sink. Turn aniso down to x8 and AA down to x2 or x4 as they are mostly redundant on regular sized monitors too. On one R9 280X I now - after months of tweaking - achieve 50-60fps with these settings. Also a big thing is to make sure you haven't applied any ""core unparking"" fixes, because they'll likely harm your performance more than anything else.  You are VASTLY overestimating the power of your card and your CPU. It's not even a Fury X and that's only just comparable to a GTX 980. Difference between us is I'm using an Intel i7 as well, so I don't have the AMD issues with draw distance. Just because you have an 8 core CPU doesn't mean ANYTHING will use all 8 cores properly, because right now in gaming they don't.  In addition, 6Gb of ram is kinda low.  Also, Dying Light has some inherent issues."
dyinglight,3dj94w,Iyagovos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:52:44 2015 UTC,"Aw shit my bad I worded wrong... I ment anything that was dying light settings wise, not by my graphic card can handle any game it throw at.  Sry for the confusion.  And also how would I know I have this ""core unparking"" and how do I take it off"
dyinglight,3dj94w,TaintedSquirrel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:25:52 2015 UTC,"If you don't know if you have it on, you probably don't have it on, don't worry about it. :)  Also Dying Light may be a couple of years old now but it is a pretty intensive game still, as I say I have to turn stuff down to get it working right. Crossfire has issues with water and blood textures flickering but even with the performance increase it's hard to run properly.  As stated previously the render distance slider is absolutely redundant past 50% anyway, so I'd knock it down to 40% or so and see if you have a noticeable performance increase, it's just going to be about tweaking it until it's ok for you."

dyinglight,3dhgfc,paradoxofnight,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm debating on whether the grind to get the SS suppressor is even worth it. For one, you have to level up the NH skill tree AGAIN, which as I stated is about as much fun as pulling teeth. And you're not even guaranteed a skill point each level after reaching level 21. And even with the spit, SS is still massively over powered, especially if you're up against a group of 2-4 Survivors. Unless you can get all of them at once with 2 spits, someone is still going to be able to spam the hell out of SS. And lets be honest, if you can get all 4 Survivors with one or two spits, they're probably not that good to begin with."

dyinglight,3dfxz3,ManWithYourPlan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:03:31 2015 UTC,"Nope, there is a creative parkour route.  Go into the courtyard area. Go straight back to the wall of apartments. Right hand side has a ledge you can hang from. Hang on it, and turn around towards the right. Look for the overhanging lamp post. Jump and grab it. Turn back towards the apartments. Jump onto the landing. There is a gap between the porches of each apartment. Jump in between them upwards and you will eventually reach the top floor.  Tricky part. Put your left (or right) touching the balcony. Jump and move slightly so that you land on the balcony instead of the porch. Turn and jump and grab onto the roof. The korek machete blueprint is hidden up there in a little nook between one of the little rooms on the roof, and some barrels. It's in a blue utility box. Kick it like 70 times and it opens."

If the survivor throws 2 flares quickly he will hit a lenghly cooldown before he can throw another.  Also, take note of the radius of the flare on your minimap.  A lot of the time survivors think they are covered but they have actually stepped outside the protective area.  I've gotten a lot of pounces with them standing just outside the range."

They teased vehicles and a new map a few months ago but have gone fairly quiet about it, but with the Hellraid dev team joining them on DL, numerous mentions by Techland of ""making something big"", and them saying to stay tuned (probably for Gamescom), this makes me think they went back and improved the map/vehicles and made a big expansion out of it."

dyinglight,3d3qtw,livinglitch,11,Mon Jul 13 07:42:59 2015 UTC,"The early stages of the game are rather challenging, especially if you play on hard mode. It's not really until you start to get Blue weapons that you can take on a number of Zombies before repairing your weapon. It also depends on what skills you have in your Survival tree. It also helps if you have the 'Lucky Repair' perk (Unlocked at Survival level 7), which can give you a chance to repair your weapon without it using one of your repair slot.  But really, when you're just beginning the game isn't suppose to be easy. You're meant to survive by playing carefully and knowing when to fight and when to flee. That's what makes Dying Light so much fun."
dyinglight,3d3qtw,SchmittyBoss,4,Mon Jul 13 08:30:53 2015 UTC,See thats what I assumed I just started this game a month ago and I got two different games near the end of it im 80% done with the story and the first half felt like scary intense survival now its like a freerunning zombie beat-um up game. I love both sides of it.
dyinglight,3d3qtw,ImFree123,3,Mon Jul 13 15:09:47 2015 UTC,"Are you aiming for the head?

dyinglight,3d3qtw,CCCPironCurtain,2,Mon Jul 13 18:51:44 2015 UTC,"The moment you play with a friend. Solo it can be a challenge to plow through a herd of zombies. The moment my friend joined the game we get creative and try crazy stuff like playing tennis by dropkicking zombies back and forth.  It does take the challenge away though. Like schmitty says the game is more about knowing when to fight and flee. (They did not implement all the parkour so you could just safri duo you way through the game.  One of the best times for me in game was at a night time mission hiding from a shitload of volatiles, slowly progressing through to my objective while deciding what groups of normal zombies i want to fight or avoid. (vague on purpose so i don't spoil the story)"
dyinglight,3d3qtw,leelee9000,2,Mon Jul 13 12:45:04 2015 UTC,"Just run away until you get better weapons. Also use the environment to kill zombies. Its rough going in the beginning, but that's part of the fun."
dyinglight,3d3qtw,daggah,2,Mon Jul 13 15:18:14 2015 UTC,"I just found big groups and killed them till I leveled up a couple  times and that helped. And I like blades much better than blunt weapons, felt like I chopped off heads and sped stuff way up. You can also save money, buy a strong weapon, and upgrade and enhance it. And get the dropkick move soon as you can, that helped me a lot!"
dyinglight,3d3qtw,TekTrixter,2,Mon Jul 13 19:08:42 2015 UTC,"Well, sending zombies flying off of bridges or buildings with a flying drop kick is hilarious, so there's that.  And later on in the game when you get more powerful weapons, you can tear through hordes pretty easily.  Especially with upgraded/modded bladed weapons of purple quality or better.  Finally, durability is much less of a problem later on when you get two key skills that A) reduce durability hits on your weapons as you use them, and B) give a chance to not use up a repair slot on a weapon when you repair it.    And you'll eventually run into random encounter escort missions where, upon completion, the NPC offers to refurbish your weapon.  This restores the repair slots.  However, at the point I'm at in the game, with roughly 30 hours in, I'm finding that I'm replacing my weapons often enough with better ones that I don't ever break my weapons enough to bother refurbishing them."
dyinglight,3d3qtw,TekTrixter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:44:34 2015 UTC,Use your feet! The kick mechanic is there for a reason. Try kicking the biters down and then hitting them in the head. Also remember that choosing your fight and using freerunning to find ways around dangerous areas is a huge part of the game.

dyinglight,3cj3z7,MrEpicFerret,14,Wed Jul 8 08:46:05 2015 UTC,That's honestly one of the most impressive elements of this game. The zombie AI and the environments are so well done a lot of stuff like this could easily pass for a scripted event to someone not familiar with the game.
dyinglight,3cj3z7,Giant-Midget,11,Wed Jul 8 13:03:43 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely.  So many times when I first started playing I'd be running through the streets with a couple of my friends and we get into these moments that were like movies. Friend has a zombie grapple him, I come in and kick it off then hack it to the ground. Another comes up behind me I didn't see, and another friend takes him out.  Nowadays though, it's even cooler. Running through the streets with my 2 buddies with all end-game stuff, someone's on the Road vaulting over zombies, drop attacking others. Another one of us comes flying in from a ledge to drop kick one into a spike trap. Then you have someone bobbing and weaving through a group, quickly slashing out with their blade cutting each zombie down like their some kind of samurai.  I also love the ""free"" feeling you get of being split up, and then going for something like an airdrop. You all slowly converge on the same point, so some of you are grapple hooking up to ledges, others are vaulting from zombies to roofs, jumping off to trash piles, while the other is taking a zip-line from a higher up area.  So awesome"

You break a whole weapon killing a zombie; in cases you don't even kill it! That's not hard at all, that's tedious. So I pose the same question, is there ANY way to switch it back to normal because I have gotten relatively ahead and don't want to play it through again.  EDIT: OP I found the solution. Go on Play Campaign in the main menu and press X (for Xbox) or Square (PS4) to show advanced settings. You can change it from there! I'm happy now :3"

dyinglight,3cg9mt,TheConnorKenway,3,Tue Jul 7 17:59:36 2015 UTC,Shouldn't be that hard. Just throw a couple weapons at em and they should die.
dyinglight,3cg9mt,DrDrums18,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:03:45 2015 UTC,"It sounds simple, but this is actually the absolute quickest way. I was playing with some kid the other day who just kept headshotting it by throwing his weapons and it died within about 40 seconds. He didn't even use propane tanks or explosives.  If you're not as good at getting headshots, throwing them at its arms will help take its breastplate armor off, and then you can throw machetes at its stomach, which is another huge weakness of the demolisher."
dyinglight,3cg9mt,TheGardenOctopus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:56:38 2015 UTC,"I just beat it last night solo. From what I've gathered and what I've attempted at several times, your best bet is to lure them to some electric traps and roast them for a little bit, then throw all the propane tanks you can find at them. Hitting them with guns or slashing them does not help. Throwing weapons at them does help break down their armor, however.   And don't forget to use the time gates spread around the arena to gain more time.  Also, it helps to memorize WHERE the propane tanks are before the final battle. You can do that in the round before, where Bolters are running around. You don't have to kill any of the Bolters if you don't want to, so you can spend that round getting ready for the final round if you want to."

dyinglight,3bkaej,Nikolai_Blak,3,Tue Jun 30 00:22:35 2015 UTC,Have you gotten an emote to throw money in game yet?
dyinglight,3bkaej,thatoneguy0101,2,Tue Jun 30 03:28:43 2015 UTC,Anyone savvy enough to explain how he built this and why it isn't the most unsafe thing I have ever seen.
dyinglight,3bkaej,MotoMini94,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:44:03 2015 UTC,For shit's and giggles...
dyinglight,3bkaej,thatoneguy0101,2,Tue Jun 30 04:21:00 2015 UTC,I understand now...
dyinglight,3bkaej,7V3N,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:39:12 2015 UTC,"Well it plugs directly in the wall without any sort of storage or safe keeping, so nowhere near safe,"
dyinglight,3bkaej,KingRufus01,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:20:25 2015 UTC,"Well he used a taser and assuming the entire sword is conductive metal it would carry the current all the way through, the tape is a resistor and doesn't conduct electricity so he can't shock himself other than purposely touching the blade."
dyinglight,3bkaej,Jamesxxxiii,2,Tue Jun 30 13:32:22 2015 UTC,Doubt he played dying light before making this. Video is old
dyinglight,3bkaej,buddy-bun-dem,0,Wed Jul 1 16:37:59 2015 UTC,"This is frickin' cool, but the presentation did it no justice. Like, it sounds like he made this video directly after a one-night-stand celebrating the success of his new innovation. It needs some more ZING! Some WOW! And a little more BOOM-SHAKALAKA! Like, you feel me? That sword has the potential to change lives, or rather, end them. It deserves more respect than a half-assed presentation."
dyinglight,3bj67t,vbl,13,Mon Jun 29 17:38:00 2015 UTC,It's really just the shotgun from my experience. The police rifle and the handguns are pretty solid. Never used the military rifle enough since I would only single shot anyway.
dyinglight,3bj67t,alternisidentitatum,6,Mon Jun 29 19:57:21 2015 UTC,"I gotta say I disagree with people saying the shotgun is bad, I've had an easy time using them and it is my favorite gun. I think people are using them a bit too far away from the target, point blank range with them is great and I've killed many volatiles, humans, and zombies easily."
dyinglight,3bj67t,WillBlaze,2,Mon Jun 29 21:51:28 2015 UTC,"That's another thing, though, that most games fuck up. 12ga buckshot is effective at at least 30 yards. Even further if the barrel has a choke tube on it. Most video game shotguns have an effective range of about 10 feet. Fuckin pisses me off.  Sorry, rant over."
dyinglight,3bj67t,ilovetheganj,5,Mon Jun 29 23:52:02 2015 UTC,Game balancing > Realism
dyinglight,3bj67t,IAmTriscuit,2,Tue Jun 30 00:02:30 2015 UTC,Confirming this... It's just the shotgun that's terrible.
dyinglight,3bj67t,evilking9090,4,Thu Jul 2 07:03:25 2015 UTC,"The shotgun scales quite litterally to a gun in a fps like CoD. Rougly after 5 meters the damage scales down considerably.   I have killed the goons with a 1 shot headshot 2 meters away... Scary stuff.   Same thing with the bigger guys, I was terrified to get so close, but 2 shots from a double barrel is enough to kill one of those goliath beasts"
dyinglight,3bj67t,complete_misanthrope,2,Mon Jun 29 21:08:02 2015 UTC,"well for realism shotguns are actually kinda shit for the situation you're describing.  it sprays pellets.  if you use birdshot it won't even kill a person, just piss them off."
dyinglight,3bj67t,ObsidianOne,3,Tue Jun 30 00:51:09 2015 UTC,Birdshot at close range can certainly be lethal.
dyinglight,3bj67t,complete_misanthrope,2,Wed Jul 1 05:41:13 2015 UTC,"can be, but if you're wearing body armor and a hockey mask like raiz' men its not likely"
dyinglight,3bj67t,sdrow_sdrawkcab,2,Wed Jul 1 05:44:25 2015 UTC,That's IF you use birdshot godammit  If you are using buck shot or a solid slug then your target is not going to be walking away.
dyinglight,3bj67t,complete_misanthrope,2,Tue Jun 30 04:56:07 2015 UTC,even buckshot if they're wearing any kind of protection will have trouble.  and where the hell are you gettin slugs in an apocalypse
dyinglight,3bj67t,sdrow_sdrawkcab,2,Tue Jun 30 06:14:13 2015 UTC,At a hunting store
dyinglight,3bj67t,complete_misanthrope,2,Tue Jun 30 08:17:04 2015 UTC,".......ok there.  i guess the game should have had options really.  but that would be a lot to add in for guns, which have a very minor role in this game for the most part.  I rarely used guns once i learned to throw weapons."
dyinglight,3bj67t,sdrow_sdrawkcab,2,Tue Jun 30 08:23:34 2015 UTC,"hey, I'm not arguing either side of the usefulness of guns, just correcting them that shotguns are quite dangerous  I don't even play dying light"
dyinglight,3bj67t,complete_misanthrope,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:27:07 2015 UTC,wait.....why are you here?  and i know they're dangerous.  was just not the best thing to kill someone with is all i'm saying.  shotguns weren't designed with killing people in mind as much as moving targets that are flying.  not that they aren't very good at that anyway.  humans are fragile creatures.
dyinglight,3bj67t,sdrow_sdrawkcab,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:38:34 2015 UTC,"I followed some links and found myself here, and commented because misinformation irritates me."
dyinglight,3bj67t,complete_misanthrope,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:58:47 2015 UTC,"Understood, i was just suggesting a way it would fit the game world better.  definitely not saying they aren't deadly, especially depending on the round.  a lot of video games have problems with shotguns and realism because the ammo shotguns can use and the effect they can have is incredibly varied.  they can have anywhere from one solid piece of metal, to a bunch of nails, to rock salt.  They can spread immediately out of the barrel, or travel pretty straight all depending on the gun and the shell."
dyinglight,3bj67t,sdrow_sdrawkcab,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:39:07 2015 UTC,"yeah, although almost all shots and slugs can travel a few meters with minimal spread, unlike in games where they spread like sand"
dyinglight,3bj67t,complete_misanthrope,0,Tue Jun 30 10:37:49 2015 UTC,"Why bother including it? Why dick us around with ""birdshot""?"
dyinglight,3bj67t,complete_misanthrope,0,Tue Jun 30 01:48:19 2015 UTC,"sounds like something i would do in a game actually.  people are too used to these weapons being all powerful explosion cannons so make it a normal birdshot gun just to fuck with people.   but really, shotguns aren't lethal until very close range.  there's no such thing as ""headshot"" unless you're one foot away because the pellet's spread.  actually a headhsot would probably do less damage because it means half the pellets would end up flying above them.  shotguns aren't like rifles, they don't fire a single bullet that g oes straight.  imagine instead of throwing a baseball at someone's head you threw a handful of marbles.  yeah you'll hit the head but a lot of the marbles will miss and they won't hurt nearly as much unless your grinding it into their face from point blank.  thats just what shotguns do."
dyinglight,3bj67t,ummahusla,-1,Tue Jun 30 02:24:14 2015 UTC,I was quite close to the bandit. We were in the school basement. A slingshot would've been lethal at this range.  It's just bad game design.
dyinglight,3bj67t,SlipperySimian,-1,Tue Jun 30 02:28:38 2015 UTC,"i dont think its that bad.  i think all the other shotgun movies are bad personally because shotguns really aren't that great for killing people.    this is a hack through life game, not really a typical shooter.  so i can see why they'd want to make the guns less powerful."
dyinglight,3bj67t,ummahusla,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:57:43 2015 UTC,"I have around 35 hours of game, and all I had tons of pistol and rifles, have no experience with shotguns, but i'm satisfied with them, to be honest. Will buy a shotgun from store, and test it, later.  Additionally, if you perform a headshot, enemy head should blow up."
dyinglight,3bj67t,LordSyyn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:50:28 2015 UTC,You can get a free shotgun from the mission with the crazy army guy that blows himself up. Just gotta go back into the compound in the part that was just blown open. You will find his corpse and a shotgun.
dyinglight,3bj67t,ummahusla,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:14:32 2015 UTC,"Nice, do you remember a quest name by the chance?"
dyinglight,3bj67t,aborschtion,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:01:08 2015 UTC,"Not a name, but it involves turning on the gas pipes after they die/turn off. Quest initiated from the bottom level of the tower."
dyinglight,3bkfht,ummahusla,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:11:19 2015 UTC,"I counted 24, but you can have a look at the side quests list on IGN (although it may be slightly out of date)."
dyinglight,3bkfht,xopherjames,2,Tue Jun 30 03:33:55 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a bit weird, because I already completed around 24-25 quests, and I still have around 5-6 quests to finish."

However if you are playing on the newer Hard mode then they are still a pretty big threat but only if you try to fight them, other wise it becomes fairly easy to avoid them all together and make your way around."
dyinglight,3bjz5r,SolidAegis,2,Tue Jun 30 02:18:27 2015 UTC,"So I actually didn't manage to ""run"" though the volitiles. For some odd reason I was litterally able to walk through it.  The zombz jumped into the pits. I was shocked that hours of failure equivicated into a single golden success."
dyinglight,3bjz5r,SolidAegis,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:02:30 2015 UTC,Use camouflage and the boosters for speed. I did that and walked through that part. Well obliviously i didn't just walk.
dyinglight,3bjz5r,Aurick411,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:23:21 2015 UTC,"Hmmm while Ive never used boosters, the camo should prove useful today."
dyinglight,3bjz5r,podgie08,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:38:36 2015 UTC,"Camo is interesting in that area - for some reason you can also use takedown on those volatiles where you can't in other areas, I just used camo, then used take down on them as I walked slowly through the area."
dyinglight,3bjz5r,SolidAegis,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:02:23 2015 UTC,Also figured out that those are immune to shots of any kind.
dyinglight,3bjz5r,SolidAegis,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:10:07 2015 UTC,Did you shuffle?
dyinglight,3bjz5r,SolidAegis,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:51:23 2015 UTC,the booster for speed comes with the other two when you unlock it. should be in th survival tree as well as the camo perk. you will have to mix two different plants together resident evil style.
dyinglight,3bjz5r,SolidAegis,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:45:20 2015 UTC,"Well yea, I have the skill, I just havent put the time in to collect herbs and such."

I personally only collect the ones for the med pack and the night vision and really only if I come across them while roaming around.

dyinglight,3bgbgx,HardCreek,10,Sun Jun 28 23:46:06 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea. Stop watching his fucking videos and feeding him. If it's obtainable on console, we'll figure it out.  He obviously is up to something. Either he's a dick or he's after views and points and kid shit.  Sick of people falling for this YouTube ad revenue shit.  It's like people just google a new mystery in any video game, make a shit video or mod something, and reap those several tens of dollars of ad revenue so they can tell their mom they're gonna be rich soon so don't kick me out."

dyinglight,3bgbgx,BabyMallard,3,Mon Jun 29 05:57:33 2015 UTC,"It's because he made a big thread asking everyone to help him find it, he found a glitch method to get it and pretended like he found it all by himself, everyone called him out on it and what he thought was going to be a popular YT video took a nosedive after all the people he betrayed called him out. Notice that video and the one before it have disabled ratings."
dyinglight,3bgbgx,zerpderp,2,Wed Jul 1 14:07:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info; I should have figured it was obtained through a glitch- looks like SYN1ST3R saw the thread after all.
dyinglight,3bgbgx,christopherhi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:10:33 2015 UTC,Is there a text version of how to get it? On mobile right now but youtube isnt working
dyinglight,3bgbgx,_No_Fatties_,4,Mon Jun 29 17:14:56 2015 UTC,"The best part is that when we've all gotten the items, he's gonna be like "" oh, I was the first person to get those!"" And guess what, nobody will give a shit because he's a prick."
dyinglight,3bgbgx,Kappaftw,3,Mon Jun 29 06:42:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If he had shared his findings with the rest of the community, everyone would be grateful and have him to thank for demonstrating how to get the weapon. Instead, he keeps it to himself and comes off as selfish and inconsiderate."
dyinglight,3bgbgx,voyager40,3,Mon Jun 29 22:52:37 2015 UTC,"Except the weapon is obtainable, and a handful of people have already got it on console. Not only that, but it's confirmed that the blueprint is obtained from the flower pot on the rooftop, not through some running challenges, like you said. EDIT: Nice ninja edit, by the way."
dyinglight,3bgbgx,DyingtoLive2,2,Mon Jun 29 00:43:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about it, hence why I'm trying to get more information. I realize that those were your screenshots in the original thread, but multiple players have since then obtained the weapon. I just don't think it's fair to the others who want to enjoy the game that people should try and keep them from getting the blueprint."
dyinglight,3bgbgx,wanahlun,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:47:40 2015 UTC,I really want to call him some nasty names as I helped feed this with locations and such and I don't know how to get the blueprint... :/

dyinglight,3bdknr,guitarguy4511,6,Sun Jun 28 16:03:59 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why you're so offended just because a white guy uses that word one time. Go listen to ANY modern pop/hip hop/rap song with an African American vocalist. I can almost guarantee that the word ""nigga"" will be repeatedly used in the context of a black person, whether they are considered a friend or not. They never talk about how they are slaves in some way. You can't be upset just because one white guy uses a word that (according to modern African American society) is okay to use openly in the presence of a black person, as long as the person using the word is black as well. Its hypocritical and its childish. Stop playing the race card every chance you get just because he's white. If anything, you're the one being a racist."

You're offended because society had told you that's a bad word. Or because someone has used that term offensively toward you in the past.

If someone didn't live in America or know American history they would have no reason to find the word offensive. It's offensive because it was used a long time ago by a lot of people. Now it's used by a very small minority, and we flip out when it's used even in reference to just the word, without any slur or derogatory implication at all.   I'm using rational thinking. I'm not supporting use of the word and you'll find I haven't used it once. I just don't like people being hateful toward someone for using a group of letters in a non hateful way."

I'm just saying you are the one who had to point out he's white. Why? Does it matter what color he is? I definitely can see how people would be offended by it. I'm not an idiot, I know how to see multiple viewpoints instead of degrading myself to insulting others like you do when failing an adult argument. But I'm sure you've called someone stupid or called something retarded. Or said something gave you a heart attack when it startled you. I had ptsd after a major heart attack at 26. Didn't bring up good feelings when people said that for a while. Does that mean you can't say it anymore? No! Because I know you aren't talking about me nor are you causing me another heart attack.   Point is, it's his username. He didn't say it in his text or direct it at anyone. If he wants to call himself a name so be it. But he never said anything directly aimed towards a black person. You brought race into it. You can feel offended and still also be racist, the two aren't mutually exclusive. So get off your high horse and move on. You aren't and have never been a slave. It's just a word. Thing can only be as offensive as an individual takes them to be, and again he hasn't used it in an offensive way. Fear of a word only increases fear of something itself. The sooner we stop being afraid of words or afraid of hurting anyone's feelings and tiptoeing around, the sooner we can be blind to race and see people as people."

dyinglight,3b9ujf,Strategy1O1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:38:41 2015 UTC,"1) You can use the good weapons, but do so only when you REALLY need to... such as a part you are having trouble with (you've died at least once already doing whatever). It will spoil the intensity of the game and the ""fear factor"" the game first has if you're just running around with the Korek Machette or any other 1 shot weapon very early.  2) In regards to game difficulty/ability to kill zombies - it changes dramatically. Once you get weapons that do approximately 250 or more damage, you're able to start wiping many zombies in one or two swings in the slums area.   My recommendation is just take the game slow, get as many airdrops as you can(feel free to use guns/explosives against human enemies). Early on just run, and scrounge for loot in buildings, unlock crates and police/med vans as often as possible. Don't worry about fighting zombies very early, only do so when necessary to collect loot or for missions. Once you get 100+ damage weapons, then you can start to battle zombies more, but be careful at first because its easy to get zombies coming from all directions if you get too cocky. After you get a bit into the game and you have weapons that are doing 400+ damage it seems like its much easier to go out at night, and taking on hordes of zombies during the daytime is not a big deal.   Honestly, don't cheat the game too much, otherwise it ruins that fun ""fear factor"" the game offers and you'll also lose that feeling of becoming a badass over the course of the game as you progress your skills and weapons.   It really doesn't take long before you get some great weapons and skills that allow you to become a zombie killing machine, so don't spoil that progression path unnecessarily."
dyinglight,3b9ujf,Negative1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:28:23 2015 UTC,"Hell, I need to play coop. I'm struggling in private mode. Yeah, first off, I suck at gaming, I know. DL is too hard for me, even on loser (normal) mode. Frustrates the hell out of me.  To get good weapons and skills, you need to do well in the game to earn XP... But it's damn hard to do well in the game when the enemies have such an edge on you. Hence, vicious circle. As just one example, the game basically says ""Oh, you're doing well enough to earn 55,000 XP? Here's a grappling hook to make the game much easier for you! Oh, you're struggling? Here's an oar that doesn't do jack. BTW, it'll be dark in 14 seconds, LOL.""  No, I don't have the grappling hook; I've only read about it. I have something like 6,200 Survivor XP after 15 hours of game time. Pathetic. It's REALLY frustrating for me to lose a ton of XP when I get killed. I hate this design choice. I'm struggling; the LAST thing I need is to be punished and set farther back for not doing well!"
dyinglight,3b9ujf,Strategy1O1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:12:22 2015 UTC,"If anything I doubt its that you ""suck"" so much as perhaps the approach you're taking to the game.  1) If you're still in the slums and the air drops are still coming in, prioritize these. If you're out in daylight hours just sprint immediately as soon as your controller starts rumbling and you see the drop fall from the plane towards it. These level you up MASSIVELY. You could probably just farm air drops for a day by sleeping during the night and going out at daytime for airdrops only.  2) Avoid most combat until you get weapons that are 100+ damage per swing. Until you get weapons that are 300+ damage you shouldn't even consider taking on hordes of zombies.   3) Get good at the ""parkour"" system. Staying ontop of buildings and having height over most zombies will keep you safe most of the time. Just practice during daytime, and get used to running over rooftops, jumping, climbing, and running around/past zombie hordes. Even if you lose survivor points, you don't loose agility/power points I believe, and this will allow you to get faster running/climbing and stamina so you can evade zombies easier.   4) Loot all the things! - early on in the slums you should be able to get into most 2nd floor or higher buildings and loot supplies without much combat involved at all. That will allow you to build weapons with blueprints (use youtube/google to get locations of good blueprints), and make medkits and such to an abundance that you can always heal yourself and have explosives or good weapons to kill zombies with.  5) Shoot humans, Melee zombies - Living humans are best dealt with by using bullets, the police rifle or the german 9mm pistol (use google for location) are best for killing Rias men or any other living humans that try to fight you, because they all dodge/block melee weapons a lot and dish out lots of damage early on. Later once you're good at the game AND have good melee weapons you can fight them with melee weapons instead. This will prevent a lot of deaths, if youre saving bullets for the living instead of the dead. Also KICK zombies first, then melee(early on), as the kick will stagger them allowing for easy melee hits, and use less stamina.   6) Avoid night if you want the game to be easier- the game has many safehouses you can unlock and avoid night completely with. During the daytime the worst zombies you have to deal with are the big goons and the crazy fast virals or whatever(when you make lots of noise). If you're staying on roof tops and taking things somewhat cautiously this should make the game much easier.  Honestly when I first started playing the game felt surprisingly hard (not overly so) due to the fact you could barely kill one or two zombies with a pipe/wrench before you got overwhelmed by other zombies, and most of the human enemies would kill you quickly because they blocked all your melee attacks. Once you get higher ranked and more power/agility skills the game becomes MUCH easier... in fact towards the middle and end of the game you'll almost wish the game was harder (I don't like hard mode for lack of search feature, because objects on Xbox one dont stand out very well if you ask me).   Honestly its just how you approach the game. Your character starts out very weak, and you have to try to evade and avoid combat, but as the game progresses your character goes from weakling to bad@$$ motherfv<ker.   Biggest starting advice though is to focus on running to air drops ASAP, look to the sky when you hear them coming so you can already start running that direction and then use your mini map for the specific directions. If you get to them quickly you'll never have any competition for them and they'll boost your level significantly, thus making the game easier as you'll get better weaponry for loot and sale."

I think it's based on preference, but I see the game more as intense rather than horrifying. There are definitely many moments that will get your blood pumping, and many things that will creep you out, but overall I don't see it as scary. There aren't really any jump scares, and the ones in the game are scripted and easy to predict. Plus, the fact that you aren't completely helpless definitely makes it less scary. You can run and jump away with ease, but you also have good combat skills. Hope this helps."

It all depends how deeply immersed you get into games, and how easily impressed you are. It has all the classical nightmare elements.

It's extremely tense in parts but overall there's much more great action than there are tense situations.  I'm not a fan of horror games either, it feels great atmosphere wise though.  Though... I have got to admit there were a few times at 2am when I had to stop playing until it was daylight... The damn school... Too creepy."
dyinglight,3b6ju4,Riddla26,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:47:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the night is pretty scary earlier on in the game. But, you can simpily just go to sleep and only play in daytime. Only a handfull of mission are in the night. I too hate horror games, I still have yet to complete many horror games I've bought that scare me. But, this is not one of them. It's one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time! Absoluty loved every moment of it."
dyinglight,3b6ju4,DrIronic,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:36:12 2015 UTC,"Get it. I'm a complete pussy when it comes to horror, I am legend had me scared shitless with nightmares for weeks for fucks sake. But I love this game. Sometimes something will sneak up and scare the shit out of you, but then you are really mobile. There's almost no invisible walls that don't make sense, and you can dodge and fight really really effectively wen with weak or no weapons."
dyinglight,3b6ju4,kigid,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:17:09 2015 UTC,"As people are saying, the night parts will probably startle you, you're up against pretty much totally superior zombies and you try to evade them. You have safe zones though, they can't get in (lights on the zones kill them so they stay away and die if glitched inside) and if you are in one you can fast forward to daytime. You're pretty powerful, the ideal gameplay is during the day and you can easily evade zombies. Standing on a car makes you invincible so it's easy to get away. You're nowhere near helpless."

dyinglight,3b6ju4,slyspy257,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:19:57 2015 UTC,"My 3year old plays this( i know i know dad of the year) and has no issues sleeping at night. He knows zombies only exist in games and movies. He wont kill the bad humans in the game though because he says they ""are people, not zombies daddy"". He would watch me play all the time and one day he asked for the controller. Kid can do quests by himself and jump around like nobody's business. But i had to tell him everyday for a couple weeks that zombies only live in the TV and that we dont hit or hurt people. Although he does hand me the controller at night because he gets a little freaked out if 4 or 5 volatiles start chasing him.   But it really is a fun and deep game. Hoping for more in depth quests in DLC since we have completed the main storyline."

dyinglight,3av3tj,Packersrule123,17,Tue Jun 23 19:17:03 2015 UTC,"hell no. actually i bought it and then it pretty much ruined the game for me. i had already completed the story and this DLC killed the game for me.  Now, to be fair to them.. I loved the game so i bought the DLC without question or review. My bad.  I did however read this.   It’s time for you to go on the offensive! Enter the Stadium, the most famous landmark in Harran, and delve straight into the carnage. Go alone or join forces with other survivors to test your combat know-how against relentless hordes of the Infected. Unlock new skills and become the champion of Harran’s stadium.   and assumed it was a DLC like ""Mad moxxie"" or whatever on Borderlands. Meaning, i took their word for it and thought it was an arena with endless hordes and loot drops etc. It isn't even close to that so I dont know where the hell they came up with that description.  Everything about the description is a lie. You dont ""delve straight into the carnage"". You delve straight into running around to hit timers. Then you kill like 3 enemies in a timer, then like 9 and run to a dynamite timer. Its in a shitty parking garage. ""relentless hordes"" ... nowhere to be found. ""Unlock new skills""... ok... you unlock a bow, which is a weapon not a skill... ""become the champion of Harran’s stadium."" on a meaningless leaderboard by having the fastest time.   Also, you start out with all your gear gone and when you quit out you will also be gear less and have to go through the shitty process of restocking your inventory, which that in general was a fuck up that I cant believe made it past beta. Multiple times in the main game you have to redo your inventory after the forcibly take it.. why not just include a button that give you your entire setup back? WTF.  I also admit, I did not finish the DLC. Maybe it got to that point but I dont see how. It seemed to me it was a limited number of like time trials where you have to run and jump on shit etc. Occasionally some enemies came out, like those big dudes with sledghammers..... two of them. You had to kill them in a time and then. Yep, thats a horde alright.  Also... you (or whole party) can only die 3 times and it resets the whole DLC. I think I got to level 13 or something, I dont remember. I do remember that the beginning trials are all annoying and shitty. Honestly, if they would have at least included a free play mode for people who don't care about the leaderboard it would have made it at least bearable. I dont care about a bow.   Speaking of annoying and shitty, there is an announcer who booms over the loudspeakers. The voice acting is terrible and it will drive you crazy if you play it more than a few times without turning it off.  So, it basically feels nothing at all liek the rest of the game. Its totally out of place, a complete piece of shit and shouldn't have been considered a DLC in the season pass. Its that bad. So bad, i lost faith in any further DLC from them.   tldr: it sucks shit in my opinion, one of the worst DLC's of all time."
dyinglight,3av3tj,WickedRaccoon,2,Tue Jun 23 21:19:33 2015 UTC,"Well. I'm usually cautious of bad reviews on things. But you sound generally disappointed and angry that you bought it.

To be honest I didn't expect it to be great, only considered it because I went and bought a psn card for the sale on battlefield 4, supposed to be available to 6/23. It gone. Damn Sony."
dyinglight,3av3tj,PCwins,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:23:49 2015 UTC,"well, im playing on pc with a buddy. thought the main game was fun. its repeditive for sure, the quests are all the same basically, but the running around drop kicking zombies is fun. the dlc basically takes everything fun about the game away and leaves the shitty parts. i highly doubt anyone bought the game to do timed trials where you have to climb on poorly designed levels. i also hate when a game purposefully gimps you to increase the difficulty or whatever. the dlc gimps you by taking all your gear away. i hated the storyline where they gimp your skills, its just stupid. i dont know if you got there yet but there is also a really shitty dream sequence level in the game which sucks. also, some climactic moments in the game are reduced to button push sequences, which is just complete trash imo. this game is fun for the run around killing parts. it also looks great. the multiplayer vs mode is pretty crappy though. maybe the next dlc will be better but i guess im kinda remorseful i spent $59+$19 on this game when i could have just waited til next year steam sale and bought it for $20 to coop with my buddy, which is where i found it most fun."

The chances of finding 2 of the same gold is equal to (the chance of finding a gold/number of different gold items)2 and this guy managed to satisfy that chance about 25 times. Nope.  He only shows off 2 weapons: both sickles and both have the same damage, handling, and durability. Duped.  About 4 stacks of King mods. Duped.  Some insane amount of money that I didn't care enough about to read, at least millions though. Likely made from selling dupes."

Across the street is a window that is a great grind location. The only thing you have to watch out for is the projectile vomit. Shoot the vomitters with a rifle and they will charge you and join the parade of screaming zombies! I recommend shotgun, rifle, good melee weapon, and anti-gadoid gun. Of course you could use firecrackers, but wouldn't you like to finally use the anti-gadoid gun?"

dyinglight,3aqxiv,King_Fappington,2,Tue Jun 23 13:35:27 2015 UTC,The chest doesn't really have a zombie in it. I was grinding the last levels and zombies can't get into this house. I was just blasting them out the window with the shotgun as they climbed and then fell past. There were lots of bodies around so this one glitched through the wall and just happened to end up in the chest.  If you knew that and were asking for the location of the spot I will screenshot it for you if you would like.

I liked the game but having played through it twice (NG+) I don't feel like it was really worth all that money. From now on games will go into my wish list on Steam and I'll wait for notifications that there is a price drop.

It took me a while to memorize the courses and get them all down to memory. I even had to redo some because Steam decided not to count them towards the achievement. But each time went to redo them, I passed on the first try. Its all a matter of knowing the course and just being capable at basic parkour. Tiptoeing to Gazi and Blue District are probably the best courses to start off on. Hopefully this helped."

I'm honestly glad that they didn't hold your hand and draw a path out for you. You have to find your own way to get to where you need to go.

The shotgun, on the other hand? Fantastic. It's my go-to for dealing with Goons and Demolishers, to hell with the noise.

I think some people just aren't aware that it keeps searching even after it says 'no matches found'  It keeps repeating the search until it does find someone.

dyinglight,3a631a,iiSisterFister,11,Wed Jun 17 16:43:45 2015 UTC,They actually patched it a long time ago balancing it. The only reason you're having a tough time is because you played maybe 1 or 2 games and then quit.  You have to level up and learn how to play the mode before you get good. You aren't just magically going to be good at something you've never done before.
dyinglight,3a631a,Id_Quote_That,-6,Wed Jun 17 15:06:24 2015 UTC,"How is it balanced when I can literally not even get close to a survivor because they can see the ""hunter"" through walls.   If I even attempt to make a move I get uv'ed, ""but just use the spit"" only works if you can actually get a direct hit (good luck with that) and if you get close only someone who has the reaction speed of a dildo is going to stand there and get hit.  I could play and level up to get more skills and see if that makes it better but it would be hardly worth it when it takes at least 3+ matches to get even half a level up because even getting one kill is extremely hard against anyone that has played the game more then 5 minutes."
dyinglight,3a631a,krikit386,5,Wed Jun 17 15:20:34 2015 UTC,"Hit and run, hit and run, hit and run. Dont keep trying the same tactics, and use your spit for Area Denial, not just damaging  Its great for separating players. It takes a while to get good, but sucking at something is the first step to getting kinda decent at something, yeah?"

dyinglight,3a631a,Id_Quote_That,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:13:28 2015 UTC,Just watch some guides on tips/tricks as Night Hunter then. I'm a Level 60 Apex Predator and know from experience that it's only hard when you aren't maxed out on skills.  Without Survivor Sense the game would be way too easy for the hunter.  Just have to learn how to outmaneuver your opponent and not run in and try and claw them to death.
dyinglight,3a631a,whydoieventryanymore,2,Wed Jun 17 15:28:29 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXW_X978-ZM   Take a look at this guy. He's low level; only has the ground pound. He still manages an almost perfect game vs two players. The Zombie isn't meant to tank. He is designed to single the humans out and eliminate them one by one.   Sorry if the DLC didn't live up to your Left 4 Dead Tank ownage days. Unless you complained about the ""underpowered"" zombies in that game too."
dyinglight,3a631a,LouisCaravan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:06:01 2015 UTC,"They put out two patches so far, so the balancing has come a long way. Unfortunately, a lot of Human players just like using the mode to farm for Golden Weapons, so you'll come across a lot of players just using whatever glitches/exploits they can to either win or just go AFK in a wall/floor.  If you're interested in some combat strategies/tactics, I've got a YouTube channel with about 50 Night Hunter videos up. Feel free to check them out! Some have audio, but most have detailed strategies/tips in the Description section."

I have yet to see one join when im with more players, while they all seem to compete to get into my lobby the moment im alone to get easy wins with their nigh hunter.  I hate when they have no energy left and they are somehow still flying around, when they throw spits at you close range because you have no other way to kill them without loosing all your bullets and the insta killing expoding zombies spawn from nowere in your face and kill you (they sometimes even climb now,at least small houses).  Waste of medkits and  flares for what? for a blue weapon with less than 1000 damage...NO REWARD FOR SURVIVORS after this frustrating mode.  The night hunter and the hives need less health when they invade solo players.  I bet the ones saying the night hunter is underpowered only say it because they want to have fun toying with solo players instead of playing it properly against teams anyway. I have my gameplay experience to prove this.   A whole night on hard with 3 players and no nigh hunter joins. Im solo and night hunter arrives after 1 minute. I back out and restart and again, 1 minute and invaded again.  This happened more than twice and it was after the night hunter buff patch."

Every single other gun I've seen, whether it's been a handgun or rifle has been blue and done the same damage, lower than even my weakest melee weapon for 90% of the game.  Really though, guns aren't very good. The only times I've used them is when forced by the story mission, or having to fight a safe building full of Rais' goons where zombies won't be a problem.

Even with everything on low it's 40-50 or so, but raising them doesn't make a massive difference. It's like I'm being kept under 60fps by something in game. Performance dips coming over the lip of tall buildings but goes back to normal levels.  Full screen is on, VSync is on (tearing is horrible with it off even on one card)."
dyinglight,39ihc0,KingKaiGaming,0,Fri Jun 12 11:59:35 2015 UTC,Oc to 4.5 ghz. That took me to solid 60 in all games. Maybe it's your cpu not fast enough of graphics aren't an issue. Check your ram too
dyinglight,39ihc0,KingKaiGaming,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:04:56 2015 UTC,"ROFL. I'm sorry, OCing does not give that kind of performance increase (tests show between 5-10% performance increase, which equates to about 4fps in my case) and especially not when my CPU usage isn't even nearing 100% already on a brand new Haswell chip that's basically top tier. If I need to OC this chip to run a 2 year old game then there's something wrong with this whole industry. It's also massively irresponsible to recommend without prior knowledge (or really understanding what you're doing), it shortens your components life span, generates a LOT of excess heat and can cause a lot of system instability.  Also, FWIW, I had it OC'd to 4.2Ghz already - now removed because it did absolutely nothing except caused it to get very hot and crash more often, 4.5 is just asking for a burnt die on this chip, though my cooler may be able to keep it under control it would still be ridiculously hot. Even with the unlocked multiplier OC'ing Haswell is not very stable on certain configurations.  Just oh yeah OC to 4.5Ghz like it's a standard number without enquiring about cooling or whether I even have the unlocked multiplier version or ANYTHING, are you mental?  Look I don't mean to be nasty about it but that's absolutely absurd advice.  RAM usage is about 5.5Gb, the RAM is fine, my components are fine, all other games are fine. Jumping to hardware oc without even considering software options outside the game is just ludicrous, I really hope you don't give anyone who doesn't know what they're doing that advice in the future."

I oc to 4.5 ghz with same setup and I get 60 fps solid now at 1440p.   7fps. So 6% or so difference, which is exactly in line with what I've said. I also highly doubt it's solidly 60. This is not going to stop it dipping to 30 under load on my rig in the slightest. 50fps is floating point, resting, no action going on framerate. It's not suddenly going to give me the kind of overhead to hit 60fps solidly. Taken on an average play session, 53fps would mean you already got 60+ for typically more than 90% of play time.  I get 50fps doing nothing, so my average is likely nearer 40 or 30. A 500Mhz overclock is NOT going to give you that kind of performance overhead.   Don't bash on what works.   I don't. This doesn't work. Let's not forget here that I can max every other game in my library without problems, including MUCH newer games.

Crane acts like I cared when he died, like they were best friends from being kids, but they had only known each other for a couple days and Raheem was a cocky dick to Crane when helping him train.  Rais was just the joker from the dark knight.  ""Chaos is the only blah blah blah let me kill my own guys real quick cause I'm a fucking bad ass."" He was full of all the typical cliches.  WHO THE FUCK writes these characters and then who reviews them?  Shouldn't they know as writers that cliches are just the worst?  Yea I would love for a new story line, or continuation.  One where the writing was at least somewhat decent.  Maybe we get more of a back story on Crane, meet people from his past who are now trying to cash in on the outbreak.

dyinglight,397qnj,trollshep,14,Wed Jun 10 11:47:29 2015 UTC,"i thought it was great.  yea, a lot of the quests are just boring filler, but even then i still had fun running around the world climbing, jumping, running, and of course killing :).  the only thing hard in the beginning is that since you're low level and have crappy weapons, zombies are hard to kill.  so only kill what you need to, and just run past the rest.  you'll get better weapons soon enough and then you'll be knocking down the dead in one or two hits."
dyinglight,397qnj,z01z,6,Tue Jun 9 21:45:32 2015 UTC,"Is the beginning as hard as the critics say it is?   No, it moves rather quickly in normal mode if you do things like quests and recover airdrops. Survivor skill determines the quality of weapons you find.   How much can you do after you perfect it? (does it get boring after you beat it?)   A lot. I've beaten it now 5 times because friends were late to the party. The story isn't the fun part (not bad or good, kinda fun to joke about with friends though--those Crane monologues!). The real fun is in running and fighting with friends. Whether it's racing to an airdrop, clearing out the bridge, or just sneaking through night, this gameplay is just fun.   Is it a good balance between survival and messing around or is it mostly about finding stuff and surviving like State of Decay?   I think I answered that above but, it's a good balance especially on Hard mode. In hard mode, you have to actually work for your loot and have a buddy cover you while you lockpick. The emphasis is definitely not on survival like SoD, but you can do that to get the most out of blueprints.   Anything else I need to know?   Find buddies to play with. It makes it so much more fun IMO."
dyinglight,397qnj,7V3N,3,Tue Jun 9 22:41:21 2015 UTC,"I heard the same as you and was told that the critics were to hard on it.  I took a chance and I bought the game (about 6 months ago). The only issue I had in the beginning was learning to aim as I wall jump from a hanging position(took three tries before I got it).   The part that I will never get tired of is the night time chase sequences. Having to think on your feet as you are running to stay alive is quite fun.  NG+ adds more difficulty by not letting you see the special infected(night time runs) and increasing the damage need to take any zombie down.  The only real issues I ran into is it taking a few tries to get trophies. A few are glitch.  Edit: The balance is survival in a state of decay only until you understand the mechanics. After you understand the mechanics then the balance tips to exploration. The only pro tip I have is what I learned from dead island, do not become attached to weapons because you will find a better soon and even crappy weapons can be amazing in the right hands."

You may personally have a harder time with it now though, because I'm guessing there are less people online cooperating on the story missions.  I did a lot of the harder stuff (night missions, bolter mission, etc) as a group which cut down the difficulty curve.  Still a lot of fun IMO, the zombie killing when you get a decent weapon is really great.  Early on you're a weakling for the first 3-4 hours (unless you cheat and look up where to find weapons)."

I did coop the entire game with a friend though. That made it awesome, and more enjoyable than playing it alone. I would still enjoy it alone, though.  I have it on PC and Xbox One. It's great on both."
dyinglight,397qnj,Jaypee_,2,Wed Jun 10 02:49:29 2015 UTC,"If you tend to play frequently/ for long periods at a time, you will finish the game pretty quickly. However, it doesn't mean the game is bad. If game duration doesn't really matter to you, then definitely pick it up."
dyinglight,397qnj,squeakychair,2,Wed Jun 10 03:07:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, yes. Even if you never do the coop, it's still great."
dyinglight,397qnj,slugnola,2,Wed Jun 10 05:25:36 2015 UTC,"I bought it only a few days ago. Bought it last Saturday(Wed now) and I can say that I will be playing this for a while. It isn't as hard as they say, no way, definitely ain't as hard as Bloodborne. It only takes a day or even a few hours getting used to. Then you enjoy it so much. There's so much things you can do. I can't answer your second question obviously but yes, this game highlights ""Free Will"" perfectly. Tbh I think there's so much to do. Just don't use any glitches. I haven't and I wouldn't. The one thing I admire so much in this game is how the environment changes at night. You go from ""Yeah let's F shit up!"" to ""Holy shit! Run like Mayweather!"".. anything else you should know? Buy it. Not a penny more, not a penny less."
dyinglight,397qnj,BadWhippet,2,Wed Jun 10 07:25:31 2015 UTC,Great game I think youll like it! One thing that is the end (50 hours in) will get boring unless you make it fun by doing personal challenges and playing with friends
dyinglight,397qnj,NolanHPerry,2,Wed Jun 10 11:18:03 2015 UTC,It's a great game. There is some grind to it. It is basically an upgraded version of dead island.
dyinglight,397qnj,KrAEGNET,2,Wed Jun 10 12:43:30 2015 UTC,"I LOVE the game (and I'm not a great fan of zombie games).  The beginning isn't at all hard if you take the advice of the game and remain on roof tops and use trap devices as they are gradually made available to you.  I say this as a pretty crap gamer.  Yes, you have to pound a zombie quite a few times before it will die when you only have a table leg as your weapon, but it's not long before you're able to slice a mob of zombies with one swing and reap all the hit-point glory for it!  It's not really a survival game though.  Yes, you have to forage for stuff, but this is to make more and better weapons.  You have to unlock designated shelters by clearing the property and making it safe.  There are plenty of optional side quests and challenges.  The parkour is great without being overdone and unrealistic.    The game is divided into two modes: day-time where there are tonnes of 'biters' (ordinary zombies) wandering around.  But by night there are 'volatiles' that are bigger, stronger AND faster than you, so you need to play by stealth at night because these are VERY hard to take down.  The impetus to venture out at night is the promise of double agility and power (hit) points which means you level up a LOT faster and can buy stronger weapons.  I'm on my third replay!"
dyinglight,397qnj,LVBTC,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:37:06 2015 UTC,Alright cool. Kinda like Sniper Elite 3 if you go stealth like the game says you will be fine. If you run and gun the chances of dying are extremely high especially if you are new to the game.
dyinglight,397qnj,mclamb,2,Wed Jun 10 14:25:21 2015 UTC,Buy it cause its a great game but if you can buy it from GameStop preowned because you might beat it in a week and it doesn't have much replay value
dyinglight,397qnj,Hello-Universe,2,Wed Jun 10 13:46:27 2015 UTC,"Beginning not hard. The first night though = heart palpitations (but still not hard)  I have only played once or twice after beating story, to tie up loose ends on the side missions. Got the first DLC and never played it to the fullest.  I think the focus is more surviving and doing missions. Messing around can be fun and help you build up stats quicker but I like to play with focus, so I kept to task at hand.  In regards to going to a relatives house you will probably be spending half those days glued to your gaming system. I used to log somewhere between 4-6 hours a day playing."
dyinglight,397qnj,Credix,2,Wed Jun 10 20:17:30 2015 UTC,This is the only game on the Xbox one I've enjoyed.
dyinglight,397qnj,Schwarzengerman,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:48:22 2015 UTC,"Do you play any games on PC? Dying Light has Dev tools and custom maps on the Steam Workshop on PC which adds a lot of value to the game.  The Steam Summer Sale is June 11 - June 22, and the game will probably be heavily discounted (50% maybe)."
dyinglight,397qnj,Schwarzengerman,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:30:25 2015 UTC,Sorry no PC. Xbox One only.
dyinglight,397qnj,noonespecific,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:58:32 2015 UTC,"It's a really fun to play game. Like, really fun. They nailed the game mechanics, items and fighting. The quests and story aren't boring either - quite the opposite. Open world questing, you make your own agenda, chase after your own story.  But after a while it does get boring. I finished about 95% of it and for some reason could never touch it again. It gets tiring leaving the safe house, running around, adrenaline pumping... I just eventually set it down.  But I'd suggest anybody play it, still one of my top 10."
dyinglight,397qnj,GarthVolbeck,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:18:31 2015 UTC,"If you like parkour and open world games, Dying Light is your best bet. The beginning is not that easy, but that's mainly because you don't have any good weapons at your disposal.  I've played 40+ hours now, got every level maxed out, completed every mission, so I'm kinda bored now in my own game. But I have a friend who plays it too and he's got numerous missions left, so I just join him. So if you have the chance to play it with a friend: certainly do that.  Good night, and good luck."

dyinglight,397qnj,Alabugin,2,Wed Jun 10 16:52:19 2015 UTC,I'm not sure actually. Been awhile but I want to say yes.
dyinglight,39853l,_C_R_A_N_E_,3,Tue Jun 9 23:08:12 2015 UTC,Did something exactly like this not too long ago. Pretty similar results.  http://www.reddit.com/r/dyinglight/comments/38gh8g/loot_from_100_gre_lockboxes/
dyinglight,39853l,neverdiveintothepit,-1,Tue Jun 9 23:09:41 2015 UTC,"yes, pretty similar... did you track the weapon upgrades too? btw, where did you open your GREs?"
dyinglight,39853l,neverdiveintothepit,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:19:48 2015 UTC,"Can't say I did, no. I was more focused on the weapons. I opened them in the Striped Dragon Hotel."

dyinglight,39853l,Zeke2k688,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:13:23 2015 UTC,They explain it a little hete and there bit it plays well on its own. I suggest watching a 5 minute recap on youtube
dyinglight,39853l,blueapplepiedude,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:21:23 2015 UTC,Cool. Thanks
dyinglight,396q2h,gigimck,3,Tue Jun 9 17:30:31 2015 UTC,I found the final mission a bit frustating and once finished was left a bit de motivated to complete any left over side quests. So I would definitely enjoy for few more smaller missions before going after the boss.
dyinglight,396q2h,fozzibare,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:53:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I play in clusters, usually when the kids are at their father's house, so I am not ""regular"" with it. I think I will just play all side quests and explore a lot more before I finish the main storyline. I think it would be underwhelming to finish and then go back to small missions. Maybe build up my character more, etc. :)"
dyinglight,396q2h,grainzzz,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:56:30 2015 UTC,"I've done all the side quests except for one (getting medical supplies). I'm sort of in the middle of the final main story mission, so I'll have to go back to the slums after I 'beat' the game. Plus I've still got all those challenge missions to do (ugh)."
dyinglight,396q2h,grainzzz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:29:13 2015 UTC,Seriously. I spent a good few hours failing on the parkour bits last night.
dyinglight,396q2h,discwing_duck,2,Thu Jun 11 18:31:41 2015 UTC,I always like to complete the side quests before the main especially if I feel like I'm getting close to the final mission. I feel like I can get more out of the game and my character will be  more prepared for whatever awaits him.
dyinglight,396q2h,JDlx,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:54:01 2015 UTC,feel   Thanks for the input! I think you're right! I think side quests would be sub par after finishing. I have so much more exploring to do on the maps! I think will stretch that out first before I wrap up the storyline!
dyinglight,396q2h,juicybananas,2,Tue Jun 9 19:55:11 2015 UTC,"I stopped before leaving the Slums and banged out all the side quests there, and then finished them all in Sector 0 before doing the final mission. Got the achievement.  At the end of the day, 90% of them are stupid fetch quests for little (or no) reward beyond survivor points. You could not do them - ever - and it wouldn't detract from the game a bit. If you're going to not miss stuff, I suggest the quarantine zones - for the survivor packs around for XP and that makes it worth it IMO.  Without spoiling it - The last mission could be really tough, or it could be really easy depending on how you handle some parts of it. There is definitely some tough parkour sections, which were my ""hardest"" (i.e. had to repeat the most) part of the final mission, but depending on what abilities you have and how you use them that part is probably easier than a section before it."
dyinglight,396q2h,_C_R_A_N_E_,2,Wed Jun 10 13:30:54 2015 UTC,If you're already at the final mission you may have already missed some side quests so you might as well finish the final mission.  Some the side quests depend on certain areas being around and the environment changes a bit during the main mission. Something I consider a serious bug in the game.  edit: the bug being you are allowed to progress the main mission even when a side mission will get removed.
