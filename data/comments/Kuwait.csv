Kuwait,3e4w8l,spectrag,-1,Tue Jul 21 23:52:21 2015 UTC,People are over reacting to this DNA thing.
Kuwait,3e4w8l,azizborashed,2,Wed Jul 22 03:24:28 2015 UTC,"I happen to think people are underreacting.  There is a reason why widespread DNA collection is usually shot down in the courts of other countries, or not attempted at all due to the backlash and public outcry that would be sure to follow.  It is especially concening that the same government that will throw you in jail for insulting religion (god forbid you don't have the same views as the majority of people here), insulting the rulers of allied nations, or being critical of bombing another nation would be the keeper of this database.  Like all the bullshit security theater measures taken after 9/11, I doubt a DNA database will actually prevent any acts of terrorism (Are suicide bombers really worried about getting caught?). This DNA database is simply another overblown reaction to a tragedy that is meant to make it look like politians are actually doing something to make you ""safer"", while they use fear to push through something that they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise, just like the TSA, extended spying of the NSA, and countless other bullshit such as the Patriot Act.  When these things happen, the terrorists win.  They want you to feel scared, and change your way of life, and erode your freedoms.  They have largely succeeded.  They make the fear, we do the rest.  I know I have sidetracked from the specific issue of the DNA database, but it is all related.  I remember what it was like before 9/11, and the other events worldwide such as the tube bombing.  It was better.  When I travel now, I worry. Not about terrorist, but about having my rights violated by governments.  Sorry about the rant, back to Kuwait's particular situation.  Is it a tragedy? Yes.  I feel bad for everyone that was affected by this horrible act that took so many innocent lives.  However, I personally don't think a DNA database is the answer, and worry about the many potential abuses that could be carried out with it by a government that has Kuwait's track record, as well as question it's usefullness as a deterrent to terrorism."

How does the government having my DNA erode my freedom?  Isn't collecting DNA like collecting finger-prints?  If I plan on sharing my living space with somebody, I'd rather know that the person is documented. Just a thought.  I don't think this is meant to deter the terrorists (they're choosing to die, as you said), but rather to get at those who think they can get away with assisting in such matters. It would be near impossible to wipe away evidence at that scale.  Man, I just worry about incompetence in general. When it comes to utilizing such info. Not about giving up my DNA info."

I used to live in Jleeb and all the kids that bullied us kids were ""bedoons"". Its just that, Kuwait is known to create a class difference amongst its ""citizens"" (We are citizens too to be honest for giving our everything to this country)  Infact, if Kuwait offers its citizenship to my family for contributing to this country for the last 70 years (yep, I'm third gen) I would gladly take it. Instead, I can't get my ""aqama"" sorted out, lol. And things aren't looking to be better too going forward.

And what do you mean ""speak about what people done to you and other people""? seriously? You think people are heart-opening and welcoming when you're bedoon?, go do a quick twitter search and see how crazy people responses are, if you think people give a fuck about me, I've a bad news for you.. you cant even tell people you're bedoon no more..youll be looked down upon and get mistreated like shit, I had a class in uni about human rights and we exposed this subject, leaving the class with 50% with/ 50% against bedoon/forgiens .. showing you this is another well established statistic that people arent all ""heart opening and welcoming"""

And the point that people  will mistreat you and look down on you when you tell them you're bedoom depends on the circumistances and the reason you even told them you're a bedoon, none gives a shit you're a bedoon, gay or black unless you start shit and pull attention to that. Like theres no reason to tell people you're a bedoon unless theyre a goverment worker, but hey.  I have no clue what the class was about so i wont speak about it but ill point it out again, i never said everyone is ""heart opening and welcoming"", everywhere in the world theres minorities that feel discriminated.

Kuwait,3dboxa,thegatekeeperzuul,4,Wed Jul 15 13:56:53 2015 UTC,that Bedoons are originally from somewhere else and they migrated here   The annoying thing about this line of thinking is that it ignores that the entirety of Kuwait's population was from somewhere else and migrated here.  We're talking about an old trading port where people are accustomed to moving from one place to another. You can't make the argument that some people are the original inhabitants and others aren't because it doesn't hold water.
Kuwait,3dboxa,zombieHunterq8,2,Wed Jul 15 01:43:02 2015 UTC,"Your predicament sucks bud, all the bedoon are fucked. I'm of the opinion that youth that are bedoon shouldn't pay for their forefathers mistakes (assuming they have actually lied about where they're from). To play devils advocate Kuwait has a cradle to grave welfare system and they really don't want an influx of new citizens to take care of. More than that is the idea of being a ""true"" Kuwaiti and having the family name to back it up which I don't particularly agree with but that's a fact. I sympathize man, I do, it's absolutely not your fault whatever mistakes were made in the past and you shouldn't be forced to literally have no nationality based on decisions you had no part in. I for one think anyone like you deserves the same passport the rest of us have but sadly it's just not that important of an issue in Kuwait. Kuwait is not a nation that particularly cares about human rights issues such as the bedoon and frankly I don't think you'll see huge changes in the mentality about it anytime soon.

Kuwait,3dboxa,DesertTwitch,0,Thu Jul 16 02:10:58 2015 UTC,"I hate to sound like a jerk, but let us face reality. Your father is not bedoon because he was born bedoon. You did not lose your passport privilege because you are simply bedoon either. There is an issue going on which goes beyond the validity of your family existence in this country prior to 1965. I can't speculate on what issue could be, but there is a problem and you will not receive citizenship because of that problem.   Yes there is no reason why you should carry the mistakes of your forefathers... but thats life and passing the blame is a case present almost everywhere in the world.   The point is, there is no point to stress yourself about why you're bedoon now (mistakes of your parents and politics) or when you'll become Kuwaiti. But rather its better to look at the bright future ahead of you.   You're almost done with your University degree I suppose? This is very important. Too early to think about getting married and having your own family. Get your degree. You'll be treated like Kuwaiti in terms of employment too because of your mother, no? So then you'll get a decent job easily.   The only difference you'll have in comparison to other Kuwaitis is that Kuwaitis will spend the first four years of their work wasting money left and right and getting [mentally] ready for marriage. While you'll be saving money to go abroad for a citizenship.   If all goes well, by the age of 25 you'll be able to travel abroad and get your shit together.   When all that happen, you can start the family that you want and no one will complain about you. You'll have a University degree, a job, hopefully you'll no longer be bedoon or at least on the right track of gaining citizenship.   You can come back to Kuwait four or five years later once you get your new citizenship and passport... or maybe just settle abroad. Advantage of coming back is that you'll be close from your family. Advantage of staying abroad you'll be able to own a house (yes this is the point that bugs me a lot xD).   If you think about it, its really not that bad... I have lived about seven years abroad away from my family and loved ones for my education that will influence my paycheck and my future lifestyle. So living four or five years for a citizenship is something even more important than higher education and you can DO IT.   :)   Good luck"

Yes I just checked the Civil Information statistics. Assuming that 55 percent are devoted muslims and fasting Ramadan, that would leave us with about 208,000 women fasting Ramadan. Muslim women are not permitted to fast during their period. In fact, they are required to pay 1 dinar in cash every ramadan day they don't fast it. So basically during the 30 days of Ramadan you have 208,000 women walking the streets handing out 1 dinars. Women periods can be from 2 days to 7 days. Lets just say for the sake of simplicity it will happen ONCE for each of them. Remember I already reduced the number of women fasting by 45 percent too. Basically with this dumb rationalisation... you have 208,000 dinars trying to find its way to random strangers on the streets. People who get it are usually street sweepers, cleaning staff at work, those men that bag your stuff at coop... etc.   Now this is just ONE example of handing money during one month, by one gender, from one nationality, in very specific age range.   Don't make me expand this ..."

Not that most people who ask for money are cleaners that are lucky if their employer actually pays them their 50 kd salary.   Also in breaking news: Kuwaiti charity was donating to ISIS. All charities should now be banned as they are all likely donating to terrorists /s

Kuwait,3d3xku,holdingon4life,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:10:45 2015 UTC,"I doubt there's a source or if Kuwait will even provide one, but yeah it has been stated a few times. I also don't doubt it, because it's so easy to trick people into donating. Just tell them it's for Palestine or Syria and they would donate. You never really know who gets the money and there has been a few incidents when people who tell you to donate steal the money (you'll have to ask people in certain mosques and they'll give you a few names). Nobody really looks at what ""charities"" are really doing. You can check cancer research charity scandal in USA (guy who made the charity took all the money and less than 5% of given to cancer patients)."

Its just the US officials were concerned and his concerns were addressed by our officials.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure its happening by my personal analysis. But I keep it to myself since I don't have a definite source to back me up.  Edit: Mistaken zedscat with OP"
Kuwait,3d3xku,loolykinns,0,Mon Jul 13 12:48:20 2015 UTC,"Source woudnt exist because charities that supposidly go to syrian refuge cant get receipts. Go ask isis in twitter if they have ever been funded by some one from kuwait or their bait charities. You wont find a solid source and the reason I compared two charities from different locations is to show they are all corrupt in one form or another.   Write "" kuwait funding isis in google"" and you should get 20 articles. I read a few and could refute some statements but ill keep his for you to decide."

Second link, well, doesn't say anything about Charity being the funder (If that's even the word).  Don't get me wrong, I'm almost sure there are individuals (Or at most unofficial or shady charities) that supports in a shady way (My personal analysis, nothing necessarily true). But nothing have been said about the more official and bigger ones."
Kuwait,3d3xku,loolykinns,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:01:54 2015 UTC,"I made two statements in my post and so I linked both. I never said it was a large charity, where did you get that specification? I said charities which in Kuwait can be anyone pretty much, people make tiny organizations that are just them and say it's for Syrian refugees and direct them towards groups in Syria. Seriously Kuwait has been a major source of funding for them due to lax laws to terrorist financing there wasn't even a law on the books against it until relatively recently so ""charities"" did whatever they want.  Don't mean to be an asshole but if you're not interested in learning why should I be interested in teaching you? If you google Kuwait terrorist financing you'll find a ridiculous number of articles. Nowhere did I imply they were large charities and definitely not implying it's state sponsored support, it's just that anyone can call themselves a charity in Kuwait."

Kuwait,3csvtf,ggaggamba,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:51:39 2015 UTC,"A few years ago I lived in Fintas and then Mangaf. My first place (furnished) was in a large apartment complex, and my second (unfurnished) was the 2nd floor a villa. I moved to the villa after I received my iqama (visa 18) and my household goods & dog arrived in country. My 3br/2bath flat was KD350. I was the first tenant as the villa's construction was recently completed, and I'd say the quality of construction and the fittings were good quality. I did have some problems with the electricity when using space heaters during the winter, and the owner was immediately responsive to get that sorted. There was also an onsite haris who lived downstairs who took care of things very well. Since there were no apartment buildings in the immediate area there was no hassle with people parking their cars randomly all over the place. The neighbourhood in Mangaf I lived was mostly Kuwaiti families, which is the main reason I moved there; I was one of the few foreigners living in the area. I was close to the Hilton's beach resort, which I was a member, so I'd walk there rather than drive because parking there can suck.  Near Highway 30 is the Sultan Wholesale Center and plenty of small shops. The drive to Fahaheel to do shopping and errands was quick, but parking there is dreadful. On the weekend I'd do my large shopping at the Geant hypermarket at the 360 Mall and the Lulu market nearby. The Sahara Country Club is in that area too, and it's a great club to join, especially if you're a golfer."

Why did the moderator agree to remove it if the post didn't violate any rule and wasn't abusive? People shouldn't be able to remove a thread if people have been replying to it.

Tons of posts have been removed from this sub, but I can only remember removing 1 post that was blatantly abusive and racist. Aside from that 1 post, I've never removed any and neither have any of the mods. So, if a post has been removed, it was removed by the person who posted it, not the mods."

I believe this sent a very strong signal to Kuwaitis... many caught on it and immediately the next day raised their flags and updated their whatsapp photo/status.

Kuwait,3b7j7x,kingofmen123,11,Fri Jun 26 18:08:53 2015 UTC,"""We need stronger military presence to defend ourselves from ISIS"" We don't need a stronger military presence. We can start with better accounting methodologies with certain Islamic charities then we can discuss the education system. ISIS is not an army its an ideology, they only exist because certain countries back them up financially and militarily because they serve their interests. Conscription solves nothing. The biggest winners of the conscription program will be those who get the contracts to build the barracks bring military equipment/clothing/boots etc."
Kuwait,3b7j7x,fmarkuza,-1,Fri Jun 26 19:51:05 2015 UTC,"I agree that we need better accounting methodologies with all Islamic charities (this should also be done ASAP!), but you cannot ignore the fact that our military is weak in Kuwait.   If you want proof, then look at how little time it took Iraq to capture Kuwait when they last invaded us. Sure, you may use excuses such as ""our army is smaller"" or ""we were not ready"", but the fact remains that we are weak. I am sorry to use such an example, but remember Israel had a smaller army when they first started, (but better technology and training) , yet they are able to defend themselves from surrounding enemy nations. If you do not believe in that example or see it as not fair, then look at what Napoleon did with a small army. Do you want a third example? Look at how the Germans ""almost"" captured Russia (or at least killed many millions with an army fraction of their size by far). We also need to learn from the situation in Iraq where ISIS appeared ""overnight"" and took over 1/4 - 1/2 of their country. If we do not train our military to protect us and fight future wars, then we'll just be easy bait. How many planes do we have? F-9? F-16? Apache Helicopters? Why are we using the patriot system instead of more sophisticated / better ones? Why do we need to rely on the U.S every minute? Can't we protect our own country? We need to start evolving even though this idea may seem naive to some people. I do not necessary mean that we need to have military bases around the world like U.S or go into every situation. Instead I want our military to be a force not to be reckoned with. If people attack us, then there should be consequences. If we are attacked, then we should be able to defend ourselves. Do you really believe our military is strong? Ask most of the Kuwaiti Citizens especially those who are older than 35+ and saw what happened to our military when Iraq came.   I would like to also point out:  ""The biggest winners of the conscription program will be those who get the contracts to build the barracks bring military equipment/clothing/boots etc.""  Yes, this is true, but it's our fault for not being technologically advanced and lazy. Every country is investing in military research and advancement while we? If we were advanced we could make those on our own, but to an extent we have to rely on people for military equipment/ clothing / etc.    I also don't want to neglect education in this matter especially government based education."

There's an announcement and an interview with the main parliamentarian responsible for the law.  The 35 years is in reference to delaying the beginning of the training. For example, an 18 year old that wants to go to university can delay their training until they're finished with their studies up to 35 years of age.  Additionally, military service is just one part of it. It's civil service rather than conscription, so working with various government departments is a possibility.

Just don't give up when you are confused about something. They use a lot of references you'll probably not get if you're a starter, just give it time. It's a great website that covers all interests.  To start, what are your interests? do you like video games for example? if you do, head to /r/videogames and click subscribe on the left bar ""sidebar"". Now, high-rated posts from that subreddit will appear on your frontpage (i.e reddit.com). Do so to all subreddits you like and the same thing will happen, they'll all be combined in your frontpage.

Kuwait,3axfih,tbc34,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:16:53 2015 UTC,But aramex would charge 16kd including shipping + customs right? I paid 16kd customs + 30 kd myus shipping charges.
Kuwait,3axfih,tyhme,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:41:42 2015 UTC,"No, shipping + customs fees, as well."
Kuwait,3axfih,tbc34,2,Wed Jun 24 11:44:51 2015 UTC,"They are all about the same honestly. They all have to deal with Kuwait customs at the end and most forwarders use either Fedex, DHL or Aramex.   So it just depends on what annoys you the least.   Personally I use Aramex for single packages that aren't a rush and can take their time.   I found DHL to be the most consistent for quick deliveries when dealing with customs. Though just this week I had some USB cables go through extra customs check for some reason.   Like I mentioned earlier at the end of the day they all deal with Kuwait customs bottle neck and their arbitrary custom charges."
Kuwait,3axfih,nibaq,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:32:54 2015 UTC,I've been shipping via Fedex (MyUS) lately and my packages don't sit more than a day or two at customs.
Kuwait,3axfih,tbc34,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:18:07 2015 UTC,"In my Experience they all take about the same time in customs, its just that aramex(SnS) dont update their shipments on time, your shipment could have reached kuwait 2 days earlier and they still didnt update on website."
Kuwait,3axfih,mark248am,2,Thu Jun 25 16:48:00 2015 UTC,SnS customer since 2001. Lots of ups and downs but I've kinda settled into the perfect formula.  Aramex SnS for shipments that are heavy or not in a rush for MyUS for everything else  Recently MyUS updated their system so they now charge on actual weight and not volumetric weight. This means most of the time you're going to pay a lot less than before.
Kuwait,3axfih,Savvaloy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:05:05 2015 UTC,"NO MORE VOLUMETRIC WEIGHT? what.. thats the best thing i read in a while lol ... yeah that sounds great for gathering shipments, then shipping directly"
Kuwait,3axfih,iiCUBED,2,Thu Jun 25 16:39:10 2015 UTC,"Postaplus has been my go-to for about a year now after Aramex lost three orders in a row. I get something sent about every week and they haven't lost anything yet.  Also, there's mrbabu.com. You ask them to buy something for you, they ship it over and you pay with Knet or cash. A bit slower than postaplus but when I can't get my credit card to work with a site because it only accepts American billing addresses, they come through."
Kuwait,3axfih,neelhtaky,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:30:35 2015 UTC,"Ive never Tried Postaplus honestly, but mrbabu.com feels like a ripoff company IMO ... because they put stuff that are on xcite.com or blink.com.kw website and put extra fee's as of they are the sellers of them.. and for international stuff.. they charge you as much as SnS and like 5-10 KD more or something.. if you know the regulations of online ordering then you shouldnt have to mess around with mrbabu.. its just an option for those who dont know how online ordering works"
Kuwait,3axfih,BusyDizzy,2,Thu Jun 25 16:42:35 2015 UTC,"Ive only used Fedex, but shit's expensive as fuck. I thought it was the most reliable though since I was sending important documents."
Kuwait,3axfih,loolykinns,2,Wed Jun 24 16:51:05 2015 UTC,"I've consistently had bad experiences with Aramex. Packages almost always come late, and worse damaged! I've had crushed boxes, soaking wet boxes, and items missing from the boxes. Customer experience is frightfully bad as well."
Kuwait,3axfih,mark248am,2,Sat Jun 27 06:53:53 2015 UTC,"Trying Postaplus now, just waiting for the last shipment to arrive to my US address before I consolidate ""group"" it ... last time I didn't know how to use this feature and had paid 4-5 KD per package sent :( , will report my experience once everything arrives as the 1st time didn't count.    EDIT: Packages arrived , with each one costing around 3.500 on average .. mind u they were all under 1KG ... assuming I ordered something that heavy or more it will probably cost more money .. at this point am not totally satisfied with PP and wish they just ditch the Volumeteric weight all together .. gonna try Myus as another redditor suggested and see :)"
Kuwait,3axfih,loolykinns,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:59:15 2015 UTC,well update me if you ever get around that.. wondering if MyUS new system is actually true and costs less!
Kuwait,3axfih,manafo,3,Tue Jul 14 22:18:57 2015 UTC,"I use PostaPlus. They might cost a tad more than Aramex, but they're very sincere and personal in their service.  They made a mistake once and lost my shipment like ""We lost it. We literally can't find it. Not here, not in our office in Dubai, not in our office in US. It vanished"". They asked me for any invoice and the next day, the carrier came with the amount I paid for what I bought (Was around $320, converted to KD was around 100KD).  Month later I received a call like ""Hey, remember the package we lost? We found it. Want it or should we ship it back? Oh you want it? Great! We'll send it tomorrow, just give us back what we paid you as compensation. No need for delivery charge, its on us"". So I just received my package and gave them back the $320.  The delivery charge was, like, 15KD or something, which I haven't paid (More money for chocolate and coffee!)"

Kuwait,3av7fw,TheScorpio32,2,Wed Jun 24 07:47:20 2015 UTC,Should be the same rate if you pay in advance. You can also get a mobile modem from Xcite or Blink and not have to pay extra for that.   Also I heard Viva has a one time 1tb package. Doesn't cap you for 100gb a month but 1tb for as long as you have the card.

Kuwait,3apl6b,mark248am,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:50:32 2015 UTC,"The problem with bricks is that they're high-maintenance material.  Haven't you walked through Hawally, Salmiya, or Jabriya?

Unlike bricks rubber can't be eroded by either wind or water, nor can it be broken apart by plant roots or be torn asunder by any little shake in the ground.  Also falling on rubber is less painful than falling on bricks from personal experience."

After spending the last 4.5 year in the U.S. I realized that people back home don't actually have things to do besides going to the mall/cinema, camping/chalet, soccer/gym or ""dewaniya."" And if there are people who actually have hobbies it is smothered by society. For example, am into micro controllers and that type of electrical engineering, however when I searched for places that sell these type of equipments, in Kuwait, I only found one place, and they sell stuff more than 10x their actual value."

Gaming in the board game or 'Magic the Gathering' sense.   I know we have a solid crochet and knitting community as well - not to mention enough craft/art stores to indicate we have several groups that are into that in Kuwait.   From all the exhibits, I can tell photography is a big thing here as well.   I think I'd like to see a good metal or woodworking community spring up in Kuwait. I haven't seen any evidence of it yet, and I'm so clumsy by nature that I'm always fascinated by folks who are talented in that area."
Kuwait,3apl6b,DesertTwitch,2,Tue Jun 23 09:13:48 2015 UTC,So a hobbies store is missing in Kuwait based on your replies. You raise some interesting points. I study in England and I see quite a few hobbies stores which we lack here in Kuwait. Will definitely look more into it.

Kuwait,39tsui,mark248am,5,Mon Jun 15 06:39:11 2015 UTC,You are missing the point here. What I'm saying is that the sound quality is sub-par for the basic cinemas compared to international standards. Not everyone can shell out bucks for premium tickets.   For about 1 KD I can get enjoy a kick-ass audio experience in a basic cinema is Malaysia or Singapore with 7.1 surround sound and DTS. It's sad that consumers think that basic audio quality should now command a premium.

I haven't been to any cinemas in the far east but I have been to basic cinemas in Europe and Grand Cinemas sounds wayyy better than the places I've been to over there. Actually none of the cinemas I went to could compare to the ones we have here, we're actually pretty lucky. Too bad everything is fucking censored like hell.  Regarding the cost, Kuwait is cheaper than London for example, I used to pay 10pounds for a ticket to a regular shitty ass cinema down the block from my hotel. In Kuwait its KD4 for the IMAX 3D cinema so it's a good deal in comparison.  Basic audio quality (dolby digital) is the standard in Kuwait and nobody here believes that it should command a premium. Imax and 3D do command a premium though."

Kuwait,39tsui,camelstash,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:55:27 2015 UTC,Good sound reproduction should be standard requirement at the movies. You shouldn't have to pay premium for it. The only reason IMAX may be sounding better is because it has a brand name to keep up.
Kuwait,39tsui,mark248am,3,Mon Jun 15 03:04:43 2015 UTC,"I paid that premium to watch the 1st avengers at imax. I hated it, the poor visuals, the sound, everything.

Had a migraine soon after.  With interstellar, they didn't have any 3d showing when I went for it. So I see you were lucky. On top of that, it was way too bright, like someone fucked up the settings again, this was was a huge let down. So now, I've lost trust in public opinion on this topic.

You really should realize that by now people are gonna suspect you.  On the other hand, as you say you don't give a fuck so you're either ""chayf nefsk"" or you really aren't controlled too much by your sponsors, which would be ideal.   Just sayin bro, you just gotta accept this fact if you haven't already. I will add that you seem to be a stickler for quality in general so homeboy may not really know what he's talking about or just went on a bad day, or either knows more about this stuff than you, or knows...what John Snow knows."

It's just a typical Kuwaiti family, they usually have a driver of south east asian descent. They cooked a different rice brand and the girl was talking to ""Raju"" and he was complaining about the rice.  How is that racist?

Kuwait,39f9oi,DrSuperZeco,0,Fri Jun 12 08:32:34 2015 UTC,"Taken out of context maybe it is racist. However, knowing that this is Marina FM, then the Kuwaiti guy with Indian accent is actually a character from the Dewaniya show that airs around noon. So is it racist to have a Kuwaiti playing indian character in the radio? and is it racist to have that character in a rice advert? I've seen enough American movies to know that it is okay for different actors to play different nationalities/races."
Kuwait,39f9oi,DesertTwitch,2,Sat Jun 20 23:26:54 2015 UTC,"You have to admit a Kuwaiti guy playing a goofy Indian does have elements of 'blackface' to it. Strictly speaking, Kuwait doesn't have the same racial/cultural memory as the US, so I understand folks here not being /completely/ offended by the commercial - but it is cringeworthy for me. It's not like the country lacks Indians to play Indian roles."
Kuwait,39f9oi,DrSuperZeco,-1,Thu Jun 11 20:26:23 2015 UTC,I don't know what you mean by racial/cultural memory as the US... but I know that in Kuwait we never enslaved any race and everyone here is in his/her own well.
Kuwait,39f9oi,DesertTwitch,5,Fri Jun 12 15:08:14 2015 UTC,"It took some searching to find proper sources on the internet, but in The History of Kuwait Casey mentions briefly that Kuwait was involved to some extent in the slave trade that was going on in the region during the 1800s and early 1900s.   Also, this French websites lists the dates of official Abolitions: according to them, Kuwait officially abolished slavery in 1949.  So technically, yes, Kuwait was involved in slavery - and anecdotal evidence is easy to find of old families in Kuwait who used to own slaves.   But here's the deal: Kuwait and the US have a different relationship with slavery in their culture and history. Slaves intermarried with their owners and integrated easily enough in Kuwait's society that there's little information of historical slavery as part of the country's cultural history - unlike the US, where it's still a painful cultural memory for them, and American society in general is still sensitive to issues of 'white vs black', etc. <-- this is what I meant about 'racial/cultural memory'.   'Blackface' is when a white actor paints his face black to play the role of a black man in early Western cinema - the role is often racially stereotyped and offensive, especially  considering the power dynamics between white and black people in the US at the time, and their history of slavery. Wikipedia has a good article on the history of 'blackface' in America.   So considering the power dynamics between most Indian migrant workers and Kuwaities, a Kuwaiti putting on an Indian accent and playing up the stereotypes has, in my opinion, an element of 'blackface' to it."

As for official abolition of slavery, Kuwait signed all the 1926, 1929, 1930 and 1949 agreements in relation to stopping slavery and forced labor. This was all part of the country accession into a modern and civil State. Kuwait also signed so many other agreements and those agreements did not necessarily mean that we have the problems related to what those agreements tried to tackle.    So technically, yes, Kuwait was involved in slavery - and anecdotal evidence is easy to find of old families in Kuwait who used to own slaves.    No, you're confusing the readers and your self by generalizing the fact that two or three local families had slaves working in their household as baby sitters, help and bodyguards and as a slavery in its known terms. And you said it your self, slaves in Kuwait have integrated into society almost immediately.    'Blackface' is when a white actor paints his face black to play the role of a black man in early Western cinema - the role is often racially stereotyped and offensive,   I thought the more common act is Yellow face? Anyway, either way... the Americans still do it when they try to show Arab characters in their movies. I still don't see what is the big deal. If you're Kuwaiti, I appreciate the fact that you were taught abroad and came back home with high level of sophisticated intellect. So cut the bull crap and stop using words like ""power dynamic"", ""stereotyping"" and ""blackface""... Kuwaitis are still simple people with decent kind hearts that have not yet experienced the bullshit you've indulged your self with and spraying all over us."

I checked my previous post on my FJ tint and I paid KD160 but the FJ has small windows and no sunroof so as I mentioned the price may vary.  http://248am.com/mark/kuwait/my-fj-tint/  Don't listen to the guys recommending share3 zeena, they really have no idea what they're talking about. You want a tint to reduce the interior car temp and Share3 zeena is just a colored tint of poor quality and nothing more.

Everything else requires training and learning. Being a firefighter or a detective is not for someone who doesn't really commit."
Kuwait,386pg6,loolykinns,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:11:13 2015 UTC,I've tried time and time again to focus on college but to no avail. I usually do well for a few semesters and then I reach a point where I just stop giving a damn. I've come to realize that I'm going nowhere if I stay in this career path. That's why I've decided it's best to change my career choice.
Kuwait,386pg6,loolykinns,3,Tue Jun 2 09:05:13 2015 UTC,"Studying isn't a career path. Going to school is a phase everyone goes through (virtually speaking). Let it be collage, university, high school, military camp, computer certificates training bullshit, and the list goes on.  Bottom line, you do go through training and learning eventually. But its better in a school than a training facility. Even when it comes to forensics.  Seriously, drop me a line. Let's talk it over coffee and explain things."

Main thing is dont drop out of university."
Kuwait,386pg6,DrSuperZeco,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:28:19 2015 UTC,"Hi. Maybe computer science isn't for you, but I think college is becoming a necessity these days. Especially in Kuwait, just having any college degree will make the bureaucracy so much easier. What took people months with paperwork took me weeks because of my college degree.   I know that with the police / military, and maybe even with the firefighters, having a degree will put you on a fast track for promotions and you'll get more responsibility. You'll enjoy your job more.  As always, the decision is yours. If you want to give college another shot or even talk this through a bit more, send me a PM and I'll do everything in my power to help you get through it. I'll even sit down in study sessions with you.    Good luck.  Edit: I totally think that if you're not enjoying your major, you should definitely think about changing it to something interesting. We can even look for majors together if you want."
Kuwait,386pg6,DrSuperZeco,2,Tue Jun 2 09:53:30 2015 UTC,"19 Years old is still young. How long have you spent at University so far? 1 year?!   The fact that you joined computer science and then jumped to the fantasy of becoming a firefighter, a detective or forensic scientists shows that you're still lacking guidance regarding your career. Some might call you immature, but you're only 19 so its not your fault... it is our decision makers fault that failed to guide our youth towards jobs they really need by making them more appealing.   There are two parts to your problem. One about degrees and the other is about the subject of the degree.   You must distinguish between whether you want to only get a job that put you in uniform or being what you probably see in tv! meaning, you can get into police job with high school degree, you can work in a forensics lab with highschool degree and you can work in a firestation with highschool degree... the thing is... in all those cases, you'll be at the bottom of the ladder. So think of CSI, you wont be the cool Nick Stokes or Lieutenant Horatio Caine ... you'll probably be that dude who secures the crime scene and not allow people to cross... or that person who carry stuff around the lab to storage and insures that the lab is equipped or bring orders into the lab.   You must understand that becoming a firefighter, a detective or a forensic scientist all require a degree... a University degree or equivalent.  To become a firefighter there is usually a scholarship program that opens by the Ministry of Higher Education. They send students to the UK to get degree in firefighting. Since you're just 19, you may be able to apply for the scholarships now. If you're already a scholarship student, ask to switch concentration/Universities and they might send you abroad. Check the MoHE website, they have announced new scholarships yesterday, maybe firefighting is listed maybe not.   To become a forensic scientist you need a science degree in general. I don't know the name of the degrees exactly, but I know for a fact its not a degree in forensic science (though some Universities do offer such a degree). and I think Computer Science also gets into forensics.  And to be a detective, you need to join I think Saad Al Abdallah Police Academy that is 3 years study and gives you a degree equivalent to University degree.   If you've given up on college as u put it, then allow me to ask what makes you so confident that you'll do better once you start studying another subject?! No matter what is the name of the degree you'll be studying, you'll always have 4 years of education. You'll always do courses that you wont like, you'll always truggle, and you'll always have to work hard... very hard to pass.   So really, the question is are you the man that can rise to the challenge? or a quitter that will bounce from one thing to another whenever they're faced with a challenge and hoping that somehow sometime they'll make it through!   Let us look at the root of the problem. I'm pretty sure you're an intelligent and hardworking person or else you would have not made it to University and got into computer science!   Is it the subject of computer science that is making life difficult for you? Or do you just lack motivation?   Personally, having done part of my studies at Kuwait University, I can understand how the whole University atmosphere is not really suitable for studying. There is very little guidance from the academics, there is very little encouragement from your environment, and the horny boys and girls all around are making the whole situation unbearable! Factor into that any family problems and then its a miracle that you even have the energy to come online! haha!   For the above I can only offer few tips, and probably the most precious tips you'll ever receive...    block out everything other than your studies, push you self hard and get the degree. No matter what is the subject... as long you're inside the University... do your best to exit with a degree. Push yourself to finish the computer science degree... and try to pass even with low grades. After you graduate the GPA wont matter. With a University degree you can get almost ANY job you want in Kuwait. Including becoming any fantasy you ever had! With a University degree, the worst case scenario for you is getting a government job that pays you 800 dinar a month and all they want from you is to show up at 7:30 in the morning and sip tea until 2 pm!  Try to take electives in majors other than your computer science... I did that myself during my undergraduate studies as back up plan. I was struggling with my major as well and thought in case I couldn't continue with my major then I can switch to the easier major. That way if say at year 3 I had to change majors, I wont start from zero at the new major.  As a science person my self, I found psychology and arts are waaay tooo easy for me, so I took credits from both up to level 3 where I was not allowed to take any of more credits.  Try to go abroad. It might be good for you to have such great change in your life so you can move on. As I said, MoHE have scholarships opening right now http://www.mohe.edu.kw/dayrah   By the way, normally I wouldn't recommend going abroad at such a young age as you may get easily distracted from your studies.   ALTERNATE ROUTE: Well, lets face reality, not everyone is made for University degree... and as I said, you're you're an intelligent and hardworking person considering that you made it to AUK computer science program. If you want to get over with education as soon as possible go to المعهد التطبيقي http://www.paaet.edu.kw and in two years get a degree. Their education will be very easy for you. All my friends that flunked out of University went there and they were A students and graduated on top of their classes."
Kuwait,386pg6,DrSuperZeco,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:11:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks alot for taking the time to read and formulate such a helpful response. Few things I guess you should know about me. I graduated High School at age 16 and I got into Computer science solely for the sake of having a college degree. So, I've never actually chosen this major due to personal interest. The reason I've decided to create this thread is because I had a final exam that I flunked miserably today not because it was too difficult, but because I was simply lacking any desire to do so. Which is why I proposed that I change my major rather than getting stuck with it and going nowhere."
Kuwait,386pg6,mark248am,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:43:22 2015 UTC,"Okay then, its only a phase you're going through... many guys go through it, i went through it my self too. Don't throw away what you have right now because you flunked an exam. A University degree is your best bet for decent career. A computer science degree is good. All your other options are shit in comparison. Good luck making sound decisions."
Kuwait,386pg6,DrSuperZeco,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:05:06 2015 UTC,Also you mentioned the degree for Saad Al Abdullah police academy which is equivelant to a university degree. How can I go about applying there?
Kuwait,386pg6,suicidalfitnessfreak,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:47:59 2015 UTC,"They advertise for it around this time a year in the news papers and tv. Bare in mind that it will be very difficult to get in. Think of it this way... to get into AUK Computer science degree programme, you're competing with all secondary school graduates with SCIENCE major and HIGH GPA. Not so many people when you compare it with police academy where you're competing with ALL majors and a GPA requirement lower than the one for science degree. Meaning you're competing with more people... also you'll be competing with people who have wasta which is extremely rare when applying for University. You'll also be required to pass physical exams and stuff... Good luck with it!   Another route is to get University degree and then only do 1 year at the academy and you'll start with decent rank right away."
Kuwait,386pg6,Sentient64,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:03:13 2015 UTC,You probably need a college degree for forensics.  Becoming a fire fighter though should be a easier task. Check their website for information or a contact number to call and ask http://www.kfsd.gov.kw/
Kuwait,386pg6,herolike,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:45:23 2015 UTC,Is there any way for me to get a degree in Forensics? I would probably do a lot better in a major I'm actually interested in

Yeah some days its shit, but other days its great..same like everything else in Kuwait.

Kuwait,386z75,manafo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:55:47 2015 UTC,"Don't forget about device location, and environmental effects even things like double-glazed glass makes a difference. Also congested areas are usually slower.  There are sooooooooo many variables, that the only proper way to compare them yourself is to re-run the test several times a day, for days at a time, and if required, in different locations.

Kuwait,37oi51,Ecchii,1 point,Fri May 29 15:41:41 2015 UTC,"There is an official rule, I'll try to find it but I'm not making any promises.  Here's the thing though. Most of the cops that are going to give you shit about it, do not give a fuck about the official law behind it; especially if you're not a citizen.  And it's more iffy to carry one around due to the events of the past few years (stabbings in malls/gas stations).  You can carry one in your pocket if you want. You won't be randomly frisked, not even at check points. But if you do end up being frisk'd, and someone sees the knife and doesn't like your explanation behind it, he'll give you shit about it."

The logic is simple, why are you walking around with a knife? Tool my ass.   I don't know but you can justify that.   Yes I recommend that they dismantle it and then dispose of it. These kind of home-made stuff are becoming concern after recent rioting.   If you're breaking the law, hope they catch you. If you're not, then I don't get the point of the throwaway account.

Additionally, online realtor listings are on the rise, and seem to be more credible than classifieds in newspapers.

Was in Shaab block 8 yesterday and it was a mess, there were cars going both ways and no one could move. I've looked online at listings, the ones I can read in English anyway, and the majority of rentals in my price range seem to be in Fintas, Eagila, Mangaf, Mahboola, but unfortunately that is entirely too far for me. I guess I ought to just go take a look at some properties to get a feel for the neighborhood in Salmiya and Shaab.

Kuwait,37gi81,RationalMonkey,2,Wed May 27 13:53:43 2015 UTC,"I believe prices are jacked up regardless if you are a local or expat. Often expats get more options, as some signs and landlords explicitly display denial of rental to locals. for example if an average rental of 3 bedroom in south surra cost around 600~700 KWD, I find it hard to believe landlords would increase the current inflated prices."
Kuwait,37gi81,manafo,4,Wed May 27 17:56:32 2015 UTC,"I am Kuwaiti and my wife is Egyptian-Kuwaiti.  When we were apartment hunting an Italian friend of ours told us about available apartments in the building she had just moved into. She was paying ~600kd for a two bedroom.  We called the management and asked (in English) about availability and rent. 750KD. We figured they were high-balling us and decided to go check out the place anyway.  When we get there and we're being shown around, my wife was switching between English and Egyptian. 850kd. Wtf?  We come back a few days later to run a little experiment: my wife goes in and asks about rent, I stay in the car and do the same thing over the phone. This time we both speak Kuwaiti. She got 900kd, I got 1400kd.  We went through similar things in a lot of places we looked at. We picked the place we're in now almost purely because the management were straightforward and honest about the rent."

Easy to spot since there are some large old ships parked right outside in the sand lot next to it.   The Museum of Modern Art is located right next to it, the Dickson and Sadu House further down the road as well at the Amricani Cultural Center. You could museum hop and be done in a few hours."

Kuwait,37abhj,kwibus,1 point,Tue May 26 14:26:10 2015 UTC,"Not the best museum in Kuwait, but nevertheless worthwhile visiting is the 'Kuwait House of National Works: Memorial Museum'. With scale models, sound- and light effects the tragic history of the Gulf War is brought to life. It is certainly not the most professional museum in the world, but more 'entertaining' than other museums in Kuwait. The history of the invasion itself is very tragic of course, and to gain an understanding of the country and its people it is necessary to become acquainted with what happened."

I did a google search and couldn't really find anything that would shed much light on the differences between them. I even started doubting that MoC explained it right in the announcement.  Either way, ""much higher data per second"" doesn't necessarily mean you'll get better latency than you previously did, so if that's accurate, you might not really experience much of a difference in gaming latency, but you might just be able to download things faster."

Luckily there are private shops that do it without the hassle of dealing with ministry of interior nit picking your additions.

In fact, I think Kuwaitis are going over the top and exaggerating their treatment of migrant workers.  Have your friend personally witnessed any mistreatment or disrespect to migrant workers?"
Kuwait,366jzy,DrSuperZeco,1 point,Sun May 17 12:36:09 2015 UTC,"If you are not sarcastic I will tell you two stories happened to me when I was young:   First story : Do you remember the shooting incident in Salmiya, well I was 14 years old and I lived in Salmiya in that time and I do remember the following February The military lined up Tank for parade near Nasser Alsobah mousque So the ignorant brat me that who haven't seen any military equipment in my life decided to take a picture and in that time I didn't have a good mobile phone that can take a good picture so I took my friend Nokia 7610 and as soon as I took that picture all hell went loose by the police/military personal that were there at the time. It is understandable and they called me over me and my friend and we went and told us to hold our position till further notice ( remember I am 14 years old at that time ) and they call a police car to take us to the station which is again understandable. When they arrived the brave me told them that my friend had nothing to do and I am the one who took the picture not him and they should take me alone to prison if they wish ( I was scared but seeing my friend crying over nothing he did led me to do this ) they didn't reply and took us and putted us in the back of the police car ( it was Ford Crown Victoria ) and after 10 to 15 minute they took my friend out of the car and I remember clearly there were a big fucking tree next to where the police car that we were in. one of the two policemen took my friend back to that tree and about 2 min and brought him back but not in the car they told him that you can go I was relieved. Then it was my turn one of the policemen the same who took my friend dragged me out of the car to behind that big ass tree, and when we arrived there the first thing that he said was, to which terrorist organization do you work for I was shocked and terrified by that question as I have never did anything wrong in my life prior to that incident then I said ""I didn't know it was Haram to take a picture of a vehicle in the public"" I said Haram instead of forbidden by mistake next thing you know his hand was on my cheek and it was the fucking hardest hit to the face I ever had in my life and he asked that question 4 times and each time I tell him the same but this time I said forbidden not harram. and he kept hitting me. and after a while he dragged me back to the police car. and I sat there for about 15 minute alone as they were generous enough to let my friend out.  and after that said 15 minute the other policemen came to the car and he sat in front and told me he will let me go if I don't say anything to anyone about what that other policemen did and I said ok and he let me go.   The second story : in 2007 I was 17 years old I used to livie in midan hawalli and at that time I lost my wallet which had all my credentials and the most important one was my Civil ID. So, I had to fill a report in the policestation that I lost my wallet in order to place an order for new Civil ID.  I went to the policestation that was next to us the one that is in the back of Al-Jamil private school and I went in ( this is the first time I enter a policestation in my life and I saw a reception stand with 3 police officers in the back and I went in and greeted them, then I said I lost my wallet, mind you that I am Lebanese and wallet in Lebanese means jazdene and I know in means in Kuwaiti pooq but the ignorant me thought everyone know what jazdene means, so I told the police officer that I lost my jazden. he burst out laughing his ass off for a good 2 minutes then started mocking my accent, my Lebanese accent for as long as I was in the police station which was around 5 minutes and after that I left the policestation without take the notification paper because I was sick of his mocking and left.   and Since then I tried my best to stay the fuck away from their way.   What I do is I try my best to speak in Kuwaiti accent when I speak to Kuwaiti, and when I am something I need to do that require me to interact with Kuwaiti employer, I keep my mouse shut and when I see him free I greet him and stay shut and wait till he ask me what do I need and then I proceed with that I want from him.   I know I am resident and he is citizen and this is your country so that's why I am doing exactly that :)   and following my favorite quote : ""يا غريب كون اديب""  and if you want a migrant workers stories I got few that happened to me, or to my friend, or I saw with my own eye"
Kuwait,366jzy,MeNoSpeakAmericano,1 point,Thu May 21 06:33:50 2015 UTC,"I read that. So where is the disrespect and abuse towards migrants and expats? Regarding the first incident, the things happened that way mainly because you were 14 and you were taking pictures of something you were not allowed to do. Yes it may be police abuse or police brutality or whatever the correct term is. But after all this is a third world country where our police officers get part of their training in jordan and egypt simply to learn how to keep shit in order when there is very limited police resources/manpower, a language barrier and culture difference with more than 60 percent of the total population.   Regarding the second story, this is the way Kuwaitis are... anyone would have laughed at your ""jazdene""... heck i'm chuckling right now as I type it ;/  The most important bit is this one: ""Since then I tried my best to stay the fuck away from their way."" and for those in charge of law-enforcement this is exactly what they're trying to achieve and the fact that there are people who say that it means they have achieved their goal in making people stay out of trouble. I am a Kuwaiti and I my self always say that I'm following driving regulations to the letter not because I'm a model citizen or because I am avoiding a traffic fine... but I do it because I am do not wish to interact with police officers. The fact remains that those who end up being officers on the streets are the ones who failed in highschool, could not go into University, college or technical education. You can imagine the kind of environment they grow up in and the kind of attention they had from their families. This is Kuwait, education is free, the only thing stopping anyone from education is the effort to walk into the class room. Btw not everyone in uniform is without education, there those who do get University degree and then join the police or get police education equvelant to University degree. But to my knowledge these people get higher rank upon employment and they are not the ones we the public usually interact with.   ""and if you want a migrant workers stories I got few that happened to me, or to my friend, or I saw with my own eye""  In my opinion, the examples you brought above are not what is usually meant by abuse of expats. This happens to anyone disregarding their nationality and they can happen to any of us if we live anywhere else in the world."

Kuwait,366jzy,DrSuperZeco,2,Sun May 17 22:30:19 2015 UTC,I had the same assignment last semester. We went out interviewing workers. The struggle is real.
Kuwait,366jzy,azizborashed,5,Mon May 18 19:30:14 2015 UTC,"I had a Pakistani dude doing some work in our house last week. My father been chasing him for weeks and weeks. The guy kept skipping appointments and not answer the phone when called from a number that he recognize. We finally got hold of him when my father called him from number that the guy did not recognize.   Anyway, the guy finally kept his word and came in on the date (though four hours late). While he was doing his work he kept complaining to me and my father about how difficult life is in Kuwait. I minded my own business and kept looking on my phone doing whatever I was doing. The guy complained that he's paying the Kuwaiti government 600 dinars per year for health insurance... My father was surprised of the high rate especially in a welfare state like Kuwait. I googled that quickly and it turned out the insurance is actually 50 dinars per year. So when I mentioned that to my father, the man giggled and moved on to another subject.   He complained about his sponsor too... and how much that sponsor is charging him to get his visa renewed. That story I am familiar with... we had an Egyptian guy that worked on another room before this guy came in... that Egyptian guy had similar story and about how he's unable to pay his sponsor to renew the visa... and that he's unable because he didn't get paid for his previous job and that the man is holding a payment. We chipped in about 500 dinar for that guy and he promised he'll bring it back by the end of the week once he cash in a check. That guy took the 500 and disappeared over two months now.   There is a similar story with the tiles guy, the pluming guy, the builder, the welder... and it keeps going. Everyone needs money for some reason... everyone is being scammed by someone... and eventually most of them did get some cash from here and there because their story was to emotional.   Did we believe their stories? Trust me when I tell you, their stories are 95% bullshit. I say this because I spent my entire life in construction sites around this people sort of people. This is their nature, their way of living. They dont think they're lying and those Kuwaitis, like my father, who are very familiar with them don't consider them either to be lying... he just thinks its their nature... their way of living.   Most of those people are doing better than me, you and probably everyone here. They probably have government jobs in the morning, working those side jobs in the evening (illegally), over charging us and they use cheap untrained labor. They always claim of ill-treatment and such story always followed by financial hardship. They usually test the waters with these kinds of stories and depending on how deep you fall for it their stories will adapt.   Yes there is probably a migrant worker offended here or there... but people in general do get in arguments. If you want me to recollect the number of times I have offended a migrant worker, or witnessed someone that offended a migrant worker I'll say zero. Never ever. However, just in the past three weeks I was offended by migrant workers three times. One by an egyptian lady that was very rude and very crazy, another by an indian man who did not offend me personally but offended my mother right in front of me, and the third by another arab/probably egyptian guy.   The immigrants disrespect is such a broken record brought by some foreign entities mainly to use as leverage in international meetings. What we should actually have is a campaign about how immigrants disrespect Kuwaitis.   Kuwaitis have provided opportunities to make decent living for about 3 million expats. That is 3 million families around the world! Most of them are free to break the law and get more than one job they were contracted to do, they take advantage of subsidized electricity, water and food... some come to Kuwait only to take advantage of the health care system which will do surgeries that costs tens of thousands of dinars and all they have to pay is a 50 dinar insurance a year. I can go on and on and on...   Bottom line is, there are good people that will acknowledge the good things. And there are bastards that no matter where they are they'll always complain. That is perfectly fine this is how people are. But the problem is with the lame ass locals that go all saints on us like your fellow guy whose got that school assignment (probably assigned by some lame ass westerner teacher that thinks s/he knows it all but in reality they don't even know where their asshole is).   Yes I used lots of ass... i'm craving some ass right now. I should get off the internet now."
Kuwait,366jzy,DrSuperZeco,0,Mon May 18 20:03:03 2015 UTC,"Last year I had a summer job at the entertainment center in 360 mall. People there treated my foreign co-workers like shit, but treated me with respect because I’m a Kuwaiti. As soon as I hid my ID and put on an accent, I was treated like shit. The problem is how locals perceive foreigner’s, foreigners are here to make an honest living. for some reason people feel like it's their responsibility to make the foreigners life as miserable as possible."
Kuwait,366jzy,azizborashed,3,Mon May 18 21:57:06 2015 UTC,"Aha so you're comparing how different the expats are being treated in comparison to how you get treated? Well, for a start... People in general will deal with those who don't speak their language differently. They will deal with those from different cultures differently too. And this goes to you as well, what you may consider rude may not be rude in other cultures... Its got nothing to do with Kuwaitis or being in Kuwait. You will be treated that way too when you work and live abroad. Heck, just look at Black Americans in America and asians (indians/pakistanis) in the UK and see how much they complain about disrespect, discriminating treatment and whatever just because of the color of their ski despite being born and bred in the coubtry and probably four or five generations in! So please spare me your immaturity and claims of purity. You're a human being and may very well be just another hypocrite (and probably are if you look closely at your actions)."

Kuwait,35qhc8,tonsofreports,3,Tue May 12 17:53:33 2015 UTC,I have an app idea. All the bus companies in Kuwait have a GPS system. Is it possible to fetch the location feed from their server and input it to a transit app. All the ads on it could reap you some good money.   Never have to miss a bus again.  I know I know you guys don't travel by the bus. But think about it.
Kuwait,35qhc8,faraz4reddit,1 point,Tue May 19 02:41:56 2015 UTC,"i get that the kuwaitis are frustrated with the state of the traffic on the roads. But seriously, if the bus network was improved at least the non-kuwaitis would be more inclined to use it...but no !! raise the salary requirement for the driving licenses and let the poor saps that get left out deal with the shit service, dust and heat...because hey...its not the kuwaitis problem since they dont have to deal with that.  really like your idea btw. i dont use the bus. but i would consider it if apps like those existed."
Kuwait,35qhc8,aj021,1 point,Tue May 19 20:34:22 2015 UTC,They exist. Not in Kuwait. Transit apps. Nokia has one. Now Microsoft. But obviously they don't have access to the gps data of the bus companies.

Kuwait,35qhc8,Dombachecha,1 point,Fri May 15 11:37:58 2015 UTC,Why does the water in a pressure cooker not turn into steam even though the temperature is greater than 100 degree Celsius?
Kuwait,35qhc8,faraz4reddit,1 point,Tue May 12 18:02:08 2015 UTC,"Thing is, water only boils at 100 degrees Celsius at 1 atmospheric pressure. In the case of the pressure cooker, since the pressure has increased, so does the boiling temperature. Notice in this table that the higher the pressure, the higher the saturation temperature."
Kuwait,35qhc8,nothingkwt,1 point,Tue May 12 20:52:23 2015 UTC,:)  What's happening at the molecular level?
Kuwait,35qhc8,faraz4reddit,1 point,Tue May 12 21:05:49 2015 UTC,"Greater pressure means the molecules are more tightly packed, so perhaps that makes the forces (dipole, viscous, etc) that bonds them together stronger. I don't know for sure, I would have to look it up."
Kuwait,35qhc8,nothingkwt,1 point,Tue May 12 21:14:33 2015 UTC,Its correct. More vapor pressure the less molecules escape from the surface of the water and slower the rate of boiling because now it will take more energy to overcome the partial pressure of water vapor which is very high in the pressure cooker.

Kuwait,35od0u,iq8,6,Tue May 12 04:38:04 2015 UTC,"I use meth whenever I'm at a certain friend's apartment, twice a month usually. Its fun tbh.  Most people addicted to it here is because everything else is fucking stupidly expensive by comparison.  Heroin and meth have the same price per gram but   heroin has a stigma attached to it.  Alcohol and weed became a lot more expensive.  Hash is often 60% tainted unless you bite the bullet and buy in bulk.   I don't really see people getting off meth anytime soon.  The government needs to bend over and allow alcohol back."

Kuwait,35od0u,shadowq8,1 point,Thu May 14 13:31:22 2015 UTC,Don't talk about shit you don't understand.  Meth only keeps you up if you don't stop toking.  Taking a few hits to be alert and energetic then stopping for a while doesn't affect sleep that much.

Kuwait,35od0u,nibaq,4,Wed May 13 05:13:06 2015 UTC,I am glad that your friends are fighting their addiction and leading better lives.  I hope you don't mind answering this but what is the appeal of meth for people in Kuwait?  You mentioned alternatives yet what made your friends choose meth. All I know it as a cheap drug like crack and seen the before/after pictures and articles on what happens to the people addicted to it.
Kuwait,35od0u,tbc34,6,Tue May 12 09:28:10 2015 UTC,"The appeal is that its cheap and the friend I know basically was a moron and thought he was invincible. Its really the mentality of ""OH im not 7mar like the rest of those addict, I know how to control myself"" inna enta rayyaaal, youll never get hooked on anything. Also ALOOT of peer pressure and bad friends."
Kuwait,35od0u,zombieHunterq8,5,Wed May 13 04:58:00 2015 UTC,"Also, let me put it this way. Dopamine is what your brain produces when it wants to reward you, for example; You eat a delicious meal, your dopamine levels increase by 50%. And from sex your dopamine levels increase by 100%. Guess how much meth/cocaine and other stimulants increase? 250%   So meth will become addicting physically (because your dopamine receptors will not produce as much anymore) also the phsycological addiction of having this immense feeling of happiness that you will never get naturally no matter what. THAT is the danger of the drug, it will make your normal life 10 times shittier."

Kuwait,355jkr,mark248am,9,Thu May 7 07:53:48 2015 UTC,"Nothing like saying a sub is dead to show how lively it is.  Personally there should be more events posted on the sub. As easy as it is to say make reddit meetups. There always going to be issues on location, time and if anyone shows up.  Having public events posted that anyone can attend is a better way to encourage other redditors to personally get together and hang out at an event people are interested in.  Thats how we did it back in the blogging days. Someone would post on a new restaurant or event then couple comments later and you got a group that never met going out to check out it out and blog about it.  Also I would have to disagree with quantity vs quality. There is the reddit voting system, if it is a quality post it gets up voted and ones that are spam get down voted where no one can see them.  On a side note. I just noticed the side bar on /r/Kuwait/ and that needs some love. Lots of questions and issues can easily be addressed with more information on the side bar."

Kuwait,355jkr,iq8,3,Thu May 7 12:05:23 2015 UTC,Raise more awareness of what reddit is to the general kuwaiti public. No one really knows about it and we should at least have stickers behind our cars or something.  shekly ill be the first to have his reddit account in the back of his car instead of bbm or kik :P

He doesn't need any promotion imho.
Kuwait,355jkr,BustingYoBalls,5,Wed May 13 12:56:38 2015 UTC,kill ads and that includes events. if people want to check events that are larger and better sources available.    Absolutely agree on this part. I suggest adding an event Subreddit or links to major sources on the sidebar. There is no need for ads and events on the main page of /r/kuwait.

Kuwait,355jkr,ataripixel,3,Fri May 8 19:51:30 2015 UTC,"As the most active moderator here, I'm very happy to see this. I'm just a normal guy who likes Reddit, web design, and happens to live in Kuwait. I've tried a few times to get more involvement here, although they were feeble attempts, but it's never really caught on, besides, I'm just not the right person for the role of sub motivator/idea generator. I'm better suited for the web design side.  So where do we go from here? I think we're still small enough to get this right. I'm not an expert on how to promote a sub, or how to successfully run/grow a sub. It would be great if we had a group that makes those decisions together, like a board. Any ideas on how to best do this?"
Kuwait,355jkr,Sentient64,3,Fri May 8 11:24:38 2015 UTC,Reddit should help bring the geeky crowd together in a space.   This. A million times this.

Kuwait,34x9gd,Sentient64,7,Tue May 5 13:01:50 2015 UTC,"/r/Kuwait hasn’t really come to its own yet. Each person here seems to have a different interpretation of what it is there for. Some see it as a place to vent, ask for help or to understand the culture.   Personally, I check it every now and then to see if if there’s anything new. I rarely do, then I forget about it for a couple days. This sub needs to show more activity, thats the only way to attract people enough to stay and contribute.   I think tagging posts are a great idea to help add structure and define what /r/Kuwait is about.   Lots of different people visit the sub for different things and opening it up to different groups through tagging will improve that.  They are active subscribers that visit regularly who post and comment, while others just lurk and check every now and then to see what is going on. We should be open for all types of visitors and give them a reason to subscribe and hopefully be more active later.   Here are some tags that I think would useful to the sub:   [Events] I enjoy Events. There are a lot of events that occur which we only find out about after the fact. People should get a heads up. Examples include events hosted by Dar Al-Athar, and local universities. Events should have name, date time, location in the title in that order to make it easier to read and know what is going on. For instance:  Nuqat and Dar Al-Athar for screen writing workshop.   [Event] Screenwriting workshop. May 13-19,4:30-730pm,Dar Al-Athar (Yarmouk) http://nuqat.me/en/workshops/theimaginationexpress  [Requests] These tags should be for people asking for help or looking for information. We get those a lot like how to deal with fingerprints, or how to deal with local customs. Usually posts have a bunch of questions of what, where, when, who and how in the body text, under the title.  [Media] Video, pictures, etc., that are relevant to Kuwait. For example: the Vice video that was repeatedly posted over and over again. [Local] This can be for open discussion on what is going on in Kuwait: be it an open forum, or a place to vent about what we deal with locally. [News] Link to news articles and concerning Kuwait whether domestic or international."

Kuwait,34x9gd,DrSuperZeco,0,Wed May 6 12:46:29 2015 UTC,"these flairs are so visually offensive. they're too visually dominant on the page i hate them.  so the main issue here is the fact there isn't much content. shouldn't we be brainstorming on what to do to get this section moving? like how do we bring new people in, what kind of discussions would arouse interest etc..  tags are useful when there is a lot of content and you're trying to organize it. the issue here is lack of content not too much content so these tags are just in the way and are annoying. Plus I don't understand how these ugly tags are going to make this section more active..."
Kuwait,34x9gd,DrSuperZeco,1 point,Thu May 7 07:38:44 2015 UTC,"I agree, they suck. Maybe you could point me to a better color palette or another sub to copy? These are just the default colors that Reddit provides for flair.  There might not be a lot of content, but I still think flair has its place. I'll be adding filters soon, so the flair will provide functionality, not just visual cues. I'm hoping there will be a lot more content in the future, so maybe they will come in handy then?"
Kuwait,34x9gd,holdingon4life,1 point,Fri May 8 10:56:56 2015 UTC,Yubba reddit itself isnt popular in kuwait except among mchickens and we all know how creative those guys are. We need more kuwaitis using reddit and then we can dream about increasing the size of r/kuwait

There is nothing interesting going on in Kuwait, if we talk about politics we'll end up in prison, if we talk about economy we'll end up getting sued, if we talk about arts we could have this page blocked, if we talk about history we'll start wars between different participants, if you start posting links the whole section will be filled with nothing but spam.

I'm not sure how this relates to whether we report something as spam or not, but the other things you mention are interesting.  We can discuss whatever we want here since it's anonymous. How can you get arrested if no one knows who you are? The Kuwaiti government has no jurisdiction over the Reddit servers, so it's not like they can get your IP address. Reddit does give governments access, but it's on a very rare basis where international laws are broken, not freedom of speech.  If Kuwait blocked Reddit, the government would suffer lots of complaints from around the world on how closed minded they are and how they are hindering discussion and freedom. I'll be very surprised the day this happens."

Dreams do not effect the world nor are they predictions of the future.  Dreaming always happens,  just most of the time when you wake up you don't remember it, and when you do remember you make it seem like it has some significance when it doesn't."

I heard but I'm not sure if it's true that there are 3 broad types of dreams in Islam. Again I am not sure this might be fake or real.  1. It is simply the working of the mind and the subconscious of the person who is dreaming. 2. It is a dream that is false and its source is evil 3. It is a true dream

Kuwait,34pp32,nibaq,2,Sun May 3 15:42:07 2015 UTC,If you find make your order from 6alabat it would be much better... I don't know the cake shop but the advantage of 6alabat that it is dedicated for online orders and you'll be able to track your order online. They also have live chat incase you want to inquire about your order. Other local cake shops may offer online orders but everything is done manual and unprofessional. My wife once ordered a birthday cake from a local shop and she received a confirmation but on the date of the birthday the cake never showed up. Good thing they were supposed to delvier the care couple hours before the birthday which allowed us to chase them up. The lady owner was very rude and simply said it was not her fault (LOL!!). We ended up getting cake somewhere else cuz they were unable to have any cake ready! such a poor service ;/

That being said, I honestly suggest you try new hobbies (Shopping isn't a hobby).  A lesson I learned from my older brother. He told me no matter how passionate I am at something, always try different things every once in a while. You don't know what you'd end up liking (Let alone feeling comfortable and be good at). If failed, it'll make you appreciate what you like already and will get a break from it for a while to come back to it more passionate (And most likely better at it).  This happened to me. I hated diving (Even though I got the license), but I liked playing the violin (I'm an utter noob, just can't find the right place to practice). I'm bad at 3D modeling, but relatively good at game development. Bad at drawing and my doodles are weird, but apparently my wife likes my cooking (And so does few friends). I can't dedicate myself to sport, but so far my 3 plants are growing and looks healthy.  Long story short, try new stuff and discover new hobbies.  Hobbies hobbies hobbies. I can't stress it enough.

And to have the courage to do it in front of everyone including the car owner who has absolutely no interaction with her.

Kuwait,33xd00,Lollielove,5,Sun Apr 26 15:29:26 2015 UTC,"Well it's basically cloaked racism with deep fucked up roots. It still exists to this day.  It means nobility of descent. For generations family members (males & females) that are considered ""thoroughbred"" refuse to marry into any family that they deem not ""noble"". Nobility in this case means you must be descendant of a well-known tribe or family that inhabited Kuwait hundreds of years ago and still maintain their pure blood status.  That's for urban families.. if you have a tribe name at the end of your name (Bedouin) and you're Kuwaiti for generations that will qualify you as ""a9eel"".  There are no exceptions, if your family for example started marrying into other families that are not thoroughbred you will be regarded not of noble descent because you have mixed blood.  Now, that's what I think it means if anyone thinks I'm wrong please correct me.  You can find list of families that are considered to be thoroughbred on Google, listing them here will start a shitstorm and I really don't want to deal with drama because I don't believe in it to begin with."

Kuwait,33xd00,MubarakMMutairi,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:27:56 2015 UTC,It's a term that some members of Kuwait use to distinguish themselves from Kuwaitis that they see as 'Other' or of a lower-social standing.  It is also meant to signify to the listener that said family/clan derives its power/prestige/legitimacy from the myth that they have always inhabited Kuwait.  I say myth instead of fact because people have always been coming and going out of Kuwait before people even called it such and no single family can prove that it has always lived in Kuwait or that it had a permanent base within the town's borders.

The title itself alone is inaccurate since ""any other place in the world"" aren't all the same, they deviate radically.  Personally I think the problem with Kuwait's general internet crapiness is directly related to the infrastructure of the cables that wire out connection to the rest of the world. I think they should somehow (and someone) get to that to make (basically) a major debug.  On the other hand, as you pointed out, these companies (if they at all have any desire to evolve) should get their shitty acts together and actually provide the service they promise us when they put up their pages for out ""feedback"", that they eventually ignore.  I don't know who in the company is responsible for this, but whoever they are, they're holding back a major portion of the experience of living in Kuwait by half-assing their jobs.

Kuwait,33bbbj,Sentient64,8,Fri Apr 24 11:32:08 2015 UTC,What you miss more: Hardeez or Hungry Bunny?  Is the lag better or worse for gaming where you living now compared to Kuwait?
Kuwait,33bbbj,Sentient64,2,Tue Apr 21 07:55:40 2015 UTC,"I now live in the US and I DEFINITELY without a doubt miss Hungry Bunny. Fast food in the states is a JOKE quality wise... there's nothing like driving around at night and grabbing a quick bite to eat while not compromising on quality. Ugh above all what does a nigga need to do to get a good shawarma around here?! Maybe it's just me but shawarma here in the US (even in major cities with significant Arab population) does not ""feel"" the same.  The lag is not much of an issue here unless you live in some rural area."
Kuwait,33bbbj,holdingon4life,2,Tue Apr 21 12:53:03 2015 UTC,"Besides personal relationships that were special, what are some things, events, restaurants, locations from Kuwait that you miss?"
Kuwait,33bbbj,aat91,2,Tue Apr 21 06:20:06 2015 UTC,"I grew up first in Bneid Al-Ghar then moved to Salmiyah. I miss walking around aimlessly with my friends in the Marina above all. I used to visit Kuwait every winter break during my first 3 years of my undergrad, and without I would hit up this place called Al-Azraq on Amman street. It was a no frills place that did a TON of business cuz their food was just that good. And I would kill to taste their Kenafeh again. drools while crying"
Kuwait,33bbbj,notstudying,2,Tue Apr 21 13:22:03 2015 UTC,Why do you miss it? Other than it being the place you were born in and spent your childhood in.
Kuwait,33bbbj,holdingon4life,2,Tue Apr 21 07:00:53 2015 UTC,"Nostalgia and a general sense of belonging. This is a topic that needs in-depth discussion possibly over a sheesha haha. But I felt like I belonged there even though I was a second or third class (I forget which) resident. Also I barely feel at home in India anyway, and now I have been in the US for 8+ years I don't know what home is."

When you were here, did you spend most of your time around Kuwaitis? Indians? ...who? What kind of a lifestyle did you have? I think that makes all the difference in here."
Kuwait,33bbbj,holdingon4life,2,Tue Apr 21 15:19:10 2015 UTC,Why did you have mixed feelings about Kuwait?  When did you leave Kuwait?
Kuwait,33bbbj,notstudying,1 point,Tue Apr 21 11:41:48 2015 UTC,Mainly because I feel like I belong there somehow. I was born there. I grew up there. I NEVER saw it as a foreign land that my parents moved to from India JUST to make money. My dad had worked in Kuwait for 30+ years. He recently retired and moved back to India with my mom... but we don't have anything to prove that we belonged there. I would need someone to sponsor me a visa for me to visit Kuwait just like any other foreigner. I hope I am making sense I am trying to say that I have a sense of some belonging t0 Kuwait (even after all the discrimination me and my family have faced). Sorry for rambling.   And I moved out when I was 17 to the states to get my undergraduate degree.
Kuwait,33bbbj,notstudying,3,Tue Apr 21 14:38:02 2015 UTC,No offence but i don't know why do indians take discrimination personally you should know that kuwaitis discriminate between each other and so does many other nationalities in kuwait.   I hope you can come to kuwait soon and relive your childhood memories <3
Kuwait,33bbbj,notstudying,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:16:50 2015 UTC,Because its one thing to discriminate and its another to look at them like they're subhuman. Like they Dont deserve your compassion. Animals get treated better.

Go to any supermarket and watch how the middle aged ladies talk to the guys who push your trolley for you (why is that even a thing), go to the airport and see how they treat the trolley pushers and the travelers from any Asian country (not including middle East). See how they're treated in hospitals, police stations, anywhere that's public owned really, the tea boys, the maids, the drivers, the porters, the guys who clean the streets. The upper class get bunched in with them too. So include businessmen, doctors, dentists, nurses, engineers. If you are not Arab or white you're not treated like you're worth much. Just put yourself in their shoes and I guarantee you will be insulted and angry by it. How about you make an ""Indian"" friend? One that's been here for a year. Ask them what it's like. Actually ask anyone who's not Kuwaiti. If you don't see it maybe you're part of it?"

Kuwait,33bbbj,devistation,8,Tue Apr 21 05:51:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly I feel bitter. My dad was in Kuwait pre gulf war 1 and worked in Kuwait for 30 years and when he left, he left like any other foreigner. Granted Kuwait enabled us to amass whatever wealth we could (definitely better than what we could have done in India) BUT we left like that those 30 years never mattered in a sense of belonging to the state. We were never respected for putting in that much time and effort in running a business in the country which not only profited us but my dad's Kuwaiti clientele as well. I don't know if I am right in feeling bitter about this but this is me ranting and opening up which I have never done before to anyone, in person or on the internet."

Kuwait exists but just as someplace my parents work. I dont have any emotional bond to the country,just a nice place to live in and with some people who think I shouldn't be there-got a job in q8 in gulf bank but decided not to take it up eventually coz I don't really have any attachments here except for friends-most of whom now live in other countries...i enjoy the culture and the people and the language but most of the time i got the feeling that there was no point to my being there.   kinda wish my parents had gotten a job in some other country so i could relate to people who speak nostalgically about their time abroad or in their home country as a kid participating and being welcomed.I feel nothing good or bad,was just background noise.  edit:I dunno why I replied to this comment. just wanted to show that as a kid I didn't really care about the money-what was more disappointing was seeing all the interesting things happening around me-kuwait culture wise- and not really being a part of any of it or even having a chance to.90s kids represent! me and my friends who watched ktv2 still sing watani habibi with great enjoyment..."

Kuwait,33bbbj,coconutslpash,3,Tue Apr 21 09:05:00 2015 UTC,"Never faced any BLATANT in-your-face racism but I could just feel it you know? Like you are being looked down upon for your nationality, wealth, class and your place in the social structure. I am a Muslim and was brought up in a religious family of Muslims. BUT once I grew up and hit my teenage years, it all came to me...being Muslim doesn't matter. I knew we Indians were nothing but second or third class foreigners and nothing more. My family actually thank God was blessed to live comfortably in Kuwait with my dad having a nice little business of his own. But at the end of the day, we were all the same to you - drivers, cleaners, maids, labourers. Everytime I entered Kuwait alone (without my family), the border control officer at the airport would barely even look at me in the eye. He would throw my passport back at me and a couple times it fell on the ground.  I went to an all-Indian school because we could not afford the American or the British schools. It further cut me off from mingling with Kuwaitis as much as I would have liked. The only time I ever mingled with the locals and the other Arabs was when me and my buddies played football/soccer in the many public football grounds, which was pretty often haha (what else is there to do am I right? :).   I would like for Kuwait to be more open minded, more tolerant and please everyone just respect humanity regardless of their background or their ethnicity or their work. One day the tables can change and who will then care for those of us that were high and mighty once? At the end of the day, we are gonna be worm food so what is this ego and pride (that you were born into, not earned) going to get you?  Sorry for the rant, I have never ever taken this out of my chest."

Kuwait,33bbbj,DarthSully,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:19:03 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. I'm a Kuwaiti from a good family, and I hate how discriminatory Kuwait gets. I go to college and see a million Indian drivers being forced to wait for god knows how long in the super hot laser sun because of the girls are think of themselves as princesses.  But in reality, this is partially due to a ton of indians and egyptians fucking up a large part of Kuwait. The roads are dominated by horrible drivers, both indian and egyptian, and that results in a lot of young people really disliking indians and egyptians for that. Also, indians and egyptians (a lot of them but not all) spit everywhere and make the places dirty. Now Kuwaitis are nowhere near perfect, but we don't do the uncivilized things some Indians and Egyptians do.  Every now and then I see an Indian who's acting like a real human being. Driving properly, using signals, drives with regard to other cars, more Indians like this than Egyptians, and when that happens, I have the upmost respect for that Indian for doing his part in making the driving experience in Kuwait a little less shitty.  I may have taken this topic elsewhere, my bad lol. Anyway, I totally agree that Kuwait could be a ton more respecting, open-minded, and tolerant of everywhere. And not judging people based entirely on their appearance and start judging them as human beings for a start.."
Kuwait,33bbbj,Sentient64,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:32:29 2015 UTC,Social norms are created by a society. When one has different social norms than you its hard to accept them. The same is said about you when you visit their countries and other place too. How about we judge people by the kindness of their hearts instead of petty things?
Kuwait,33bbbj,DarthSully,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:11:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. However, bad driving and spitting on the floor aren't social things no matter how you look at them. And even if it's part of their culture (which is, come on, it's absurd), they live here in our society now, the least they could do is clean up their act to a socially accepted manner.  If I go to a western country, I have no right to judge a couple for kissing in public or something. I mean, I personally wouldn't judge them, but someone else from my society might be judgmental towards that."

The over whelming sense of pride (God knows where you guys get it from) and over inflated egos was very apparent. I felt like the non- Kuwaiti Arabs (that were admittedly less wealthier than Kuwaitis) related to us Indians more. I wish I had more of an interaction with Kuwaiti youth as I grew up but unfortunately I went to an all Indian school and not a Kuwaiti school or the British/American schools."

Oh god I hate seeing how prideful and egotistical Kuwaitis generally are. They get it from being from a Kuwaiti bloodline, but let's face it, so what? who gives a fuck if your daddy is from this family or not. I've met and known enough Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaiti Arabs to know that your origin is entirely meaningless except for genetical effects on your personality in extreme cases.  My best female friend is from a beduin family and my previous best female friend is from a ""7athar"" origin. The girl from a beduin family is infinitely a better person than the other girl. I've known people in a reverse case too, where the beduin-originated person is just retarded and a bad person. Origin has nothing to do with your pride or ego or anything. This is mostly why I wish individualism is a bigger thing in Kuwait. It would severely lower the unnecessary pride that comes from the bloodline which is just narcissism that isn't even based on anything real."

I know America, Americans, and their culture very well, according to movies, tv shows, some people I've known over the internet and facebook. Are they like that in real life? Or would I get shocked at how different life is there?  You have no idea how badly I want these questions answered from someone who lived and was born in Kuwait but now lives there (especially for years).

Most kuwaiti and american free lancers ive spoken with charge about 200-600 kwd for my simple website. (About 10 webpages with multilingual support)  The prices vary on custom design vs template, support level and a few other things.  Companies I've talked to in Kuwait have prices starting at 1500 kwd. Except for Gulfweb which gave me a quote of about 500.   In the end it really depends on what exactly you're looking for. You're best of talking to the companies yourself and clearly explaining what you need to get accurate quotes (I crudely drew a site map + landing page in paint for example). Ask for the protfolios of everyone you talk to so you have a rough idea of what they're capable of."

Kuwait,32p5wt,TiesCenter,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:54:21 2015 UTC,"Hi there, I hope I can help you out as much as possible since web and mobile is my field and I'm doing my own startup. I'll give you some recommendation although I have not worked with any design/web firms. (I have however worked with startups but what I'll say does not come from my experience with them).  1. Mobile first:  1.1 Mobile App:  I would honestly recommend considering the option of creating a mobile app rather than a website. Simple because of the power and ease a mobile app gives you. A mobile app can allow you to   access your client's contacts, social accounts which you can use to advertise your product use the mobile's notification system; which probably be something you are going to probably need if you are developing a subscription-based service. Mobile notification are a really nice way to let your user know something without them opening the app or website. offline access; This probably doesn't apply if you are using an online service but nevertheless it is an accessibility. much richer experience; I found that while developing mobile apps, I could use heavy backgrounds or heavy libraries (heavy means big file sizes, ~MBs) which otherwise in websites I would not allow myself to use because it will make the page slow. With mobile however, as a developer/designer I am free to use whatever resource I want no matter how big it is because they are all available within the app itself and loads instantaneously. Pages go much more quickly unlike a website. cross platform; this is not true for all mobile apps but it might appear likely to yours if as I think it is, it won't require any feature specific to a platform (ie iOS-specific features/Android-specific features etc..) if so then consider cross-mobile platforms which allow you to create a single app and deploy to multiple platforms. I use PhoneGap which is nice because you design the app as a website and then deploy it to iOS/Android/Windows/BB. Also this allows you to hire only one PhoneGap developer and more Web-developers (who charge lesser than mobile developers) to develop the app rather than having a team of mobile developers. easy market presence; if your idea is not in the mobile market yet chances are that if someone types keywords related to your idea on the AppStore or PlayStore, your app comes on top. What's more is that you can get some extra publicity if your app get featured.. etc.. etc   1.2 Mobile friendly website   Google SEO. You are going to want to have your website come up on top of search results if you are going to need any business come to your site. Google will update their site rank algorithm to rank website that mobile friendly higher than websites that are not. They used to do this before, but this update has more rigorous checks to make sure that your site is truly mobile friendly. 60% of people use a mobile/tablet to browse a website. Not much to say here. This point should be the biggest reason why should go mobile.   2. Performance  Make sure that the site loads quickly irrespective of the content in it. I had a site that had 3s load time on the homepage. Shortening that down to 0.2s gave me 120% increase in people who visited that site.  Also there are now new technologies in the web market that allow you to have a much more seamless and richer experience. Consider speaking to a webdev about Backbone.js and Angular.js if you can.    3. Appeal  Make sure you have some points on how to have your users stay with the site as soon as they visit it customers. For example this article mentions how color is useful for capturing attention.  4. Social Networks  Other than having share buttons or like buttons, I recommend integrating login/signup with social networks in your site. I found that 80% of users registered in my site were registered with me using either facebook or twitter. Also have a look at paywithatweet.  5. Have a clear idea of what you want  A nice exercise for you is to go around different sites, (awwwards, CreativeMarket are my favorites) and pick out things that you like. Then present it to your firm and tell this this is what you want. When I was a junior web developer I found that it was easier for me to understand what my employer expected and I was able to deliver that to the point.   6. Make sure you get what you want  I have seen alot of cases of web firms either extend months after their deadline or give a shitty product. Make sure you have a very strict and clear contract, taking care of deadlines and never compensate for anything they do wrong (that is not covered by your contract, so make sure you cover as much as possible). Having a friend who is a web-developer can help in advising you when they carry out their work.  These are points that I think you should keep in mind and probably consider when are going to expect some result from the firm you will be hiring. I have had a ridiculous history of website, design and startups and that is most of all that I know."
Kuwait,32o8xk,BustingYoBalls,4,Wed Apr 15 11:22:30 2015 UTC,"Hi bustingyoballs, i have sent numerous emails to blizzard back in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, all they gave me was a ""we'll consider it in the future"" type of bullshit. Been there done that, recently quit competitive online gaming in 2010 because of this bs...latency, ping levels and stable connections need to be better, Fiber optic cables need to be spread out. There needs to be improvement from BOTH the ISP's and the gaming company.  for the gaming companies atleast have a server in the middle-east, shit maybe even turkey or saudi arabia. But it looks highly unlikely.   For isp's have a stable reliable connection and for  the love of God implement fiber optics in areas that do not have any and are working with 2-6mbps connections."
Kuwait,32o8xk,Feyasko,3,Wed Apr 15 13:24:18 2015 UTC,"You are correct. Both parties share the same problem. However with my experience, I found that there is nothing really wrong with my 2mb Qnet connection. Here's why:  In Call of Duty, getting matched online with people either from Kuwait or any Arab country is rather common. When this happens a host is chosen out of all the other players that the rest connect to. Most of the time, the connection can be compared to LAN gameplay.  In League of Legends, there is no host but servers provided by the company that gamers can connect to. This results in lag for us since the connection travels a great distance.  I have also compared the latency of a fiber optics connection and a DSL connection but only on league of legends. And I can tell you that the difference is barely noticeable.  You asking Blizzard is a step. However, if every Arabian gamer took part in that same process I'm sure something would change. Numbers talk!"

Kuwait,32o8xk,obeya,4,Wed Apr 15 14:17:32 2015 UTC,"Getting a server on ME is a lot more complex then I had originally thought, since Arab countries don't connect to each other directly but rather have to ping back to Europe and back.   As explained by LoL staff:   ""To be transparent, the biggest challenge for the Middle East region is to find a server spot that improve latency for the whole region and to make sure there are enough CCU (concurrent players) at a given time to ensure reasonable matchmaking.  For example, if we put servers in Egypt, players in Saudi Arabia may have a worse ping because of Internet infrastructure: most connections from Saudi would through europe first before going back to Egypt. And vice versa. There are potential solutions for this so don't lose hope but what we are saying this is not just a simple geographical equation. The Internet infrastructure is not that simple."""
Kuwait,32o8xk,Zbaidy,2,Thu Apr 16 10:51:40 2015 UTC,"You can always switch to playing DOTA2/CSGO both those games have servers in Dubai for us middle eastern players and ping is about 30-60. I do realise you might not like DOTA2 and prefer LoL over it, just saying that you should give it a shot and try it out now that the latency is low maybe your experience will get better."
Kuwait,32o8xk,yourstress,2,Wed Apr 15 22:13:35 2015 UTC,"That's indeed the way to do it, and certainly about time to do it too!  People complain about high pings every day. Not that our internet isn't alright, but if it was perfect, we'd still get high pings cause we're playing on european and US servers.  Nobody can really ""fix"" your latency. You might be able to improve it with a VPN but in the end, like OP said, it all comes down to distance from the game servers."
Kuwait,32o8xk,Sentient64,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:31:12 2015 UTC,"The amount of effort I put in talking to Blizzard and Qnet (my ISP at the time) is a lot, a lot. The results I got back were closer to zero than zero.  Companies won't invest in a server in our region just because we requested it. But hey, feel free to knock yourself out and try your luck."
Kuwait,32o8xk,aat91,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:03:02 2015 UTC,"For me the problem is i don't like playing with arabs because they always fight and rage at each other and sometimes it leads to IRL fights and i've seen this happen over a game.  Valve offers you DOTA servers in dubai, but many companies have bad pings to dubai (it was decent until the last major route breakdown)"

I would also highly recommend applying at the hotels and resorts. There are several 5 star and 4 star establishments. Also the Avenues mall and Sharq mall.

Kuwait,31urd9,MightyMushroom,8,Wed Apr 8 10:04:01 2015 UTC,Kuwait was dragged into the conflict because it's a GCC member and that happened because of GCC fears of Iran creating a satellite state in Yemen and thus threatening Saudi shipping.  The dumbassess that call themselves the 'Islamic' state are just fucking up Iraq and thus aren't a threat to Kuwait because a) they're so far away and b) there's a reason the Americans have a base in our state and that is to fuck up people who think about fucking us up.  Also I doubt Kuwaitis would like to see their resources and manpower helping a state that was kind of a dick to them 2 decades back.

Kuwait is a liberal country with somewhat conservative aproach towards life. Yes, maybe the ""don'ts"" the fella mentioned is applicable, but I also encourage you to be your self, and explore kuwait and the culture as it is.  I encourage you once you are here, to indulge in discussions about religions, politics..etc. because a lot of us here are educated and open minded. Who ever can speak to you English fluently would be the type of person you would talk to freely.  The conservative part comes when you are in public, and it is preferred that you behave the way everyone behaves in public here. And that is, no over-display of western habits of hugging  women while you treat them, no PDA, and no loud talks about booze and drugs..and the such.  Also, no mentioning of politics loudly specially in a critic fashion, but again, those who speak English fluently would be the only ones to understand you, but that is an indication again that they are well educated.

On the other hand, our soldiers need to experience war first hand. It is nonsense to have a military that never fired a rifle or encountered another human being!"
Kuwait,30uqrz,DrSuperZeco,0,Mon Mar 30 22:00:18 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I am wrong but from what I understand it is important for Kuwait + Saudi + GCC to control Yemen, more specifically the western part of Yemen, as that is where a majority of oil tankers pass by. There are 2 major choke points for oil transportation from the GCC to the West which are Hormouz Straight + Bab Al Mandib - I think one of the major reasons why we are intervening in Yemen is to make sure Iran doesn't gain control of that important shipping area and possibly threaten to cut off oil flow which would is the lifeline of our country (Iran has threatened to close Hormouz Straight before).   It also appears that Iran is heavily arming certain groups in our region - is it not in our best national interests to make sure these groups and Iran's influence doesn't spread?  Again I would love to hear the oppositions thoughts on this as I do believe that I am spoon-fed a specific narrative from the media and I'd love to get a complete understanding of the topic. From I have read most seem to agree that it is unconstitutional, and I do find myself agreeing with them."

Kuwait,30uqrz,Feyasko,2,Tue Mar 31 11:29:13 2015 UTC,"I think an open discussion is extremely important for such an important topic. My goal here isn't to convince anyone to change their positions, it is just to gain an understanding about the opposition's views (other than that the operation is unconstitutional). The reason I want to hear the opposition's opinions is because we are only being sold a one sided narrative in terms of GCC media. Even though I find myself leaning more towards accepting the necessity of the operation, hearing what the other side has to say is very important in my opinion.  Yes, the Amir gave the greenlight, but we must also be informed about the entire situation so we can ask relevant questions and understand the rationale behind the decision. In the end the Amir is a human, and humans make mistakes. If we don't ask about both sides of the equation we won't find out the mistakes until it is possibly too late.  Should I have been wrong about anything I have said please correct me -"
Kuwait,30uqrz,whispen,2,Tue Mar 31 13:18:24 2015 UTC,"Dig deeper and you will find the answer, other than that, i would like to refrain from discussing as i believe that these types of discussions would bring up/increase the segregation (التفرقه) and harm to this country's national unity (تضر وحدة الوطنية في هذا البلد) both of which we dont need any of after that ""karamat wa6an"" debacle. It's happened/happening, the Amir green lighted it, back your Amir's decision and your country's decision. Note, the Amir doesn't take decisions out of a whim he has counselors and meetings with other leaders of the region to come up with a well thought-out decision.   With this i would like to close off and say that this is my opinion, glad to hear everyone else's, sorry some dont like it and some do, oh well, how about we move on to a better discussion, one that would not cause problems and would hopefully create solutions to make our country better? say like being better civilians of this once great country by respecting it and to pursue in making our society better again. Improve ourselves mentally and physically in all aspects of life, be sincere with our work, respect one another, to be respectable to the environment etc.   Thats a discussion we should be talking more about...sadly everyone wants to talk about politics and point fingers at so and so with no evidence or legal claims other than hearing it from person x or reading it from newspaper x.

Kuwait,30oo1u,yourstress,1 point,Sun Mar 29 12:37:12 2015 UTC,"I second Coffee Villains - they have an Instagram account and take orders through texting/Whatsapp. It's a small micro-roaster and at 5KD for 250 grams it's not exactly cheap, but they roast the beans in-house and know what they're doing.  Edit: wrong word used."
Kuwait,30oo1u,DesertTwitch,1 point,Sun Mar 29 12:40:15 2015 UTC,Coffee Villains is a bit out of my price range but thank you for the suggestion. I'm used to spending a max of 5kd a kilo so 20-32kd a kilo is a bit too crazy for me.   I wanted something different from the standard coffee chains like Starbucks and caribou.  Illy and Lavaza look like interesting suggestions ! I'll try them out sometime.
Kuwait,30oo1u,loolykinns,1 point,Mon Mar 30 07:33:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not being offensive or anything. But if you think spending 20~30kd on fresh and good tasting coffee is too much, go back to drinking instant coffee. I know spending x4 the price you usually spend on coffee sounds wrong, but don't expect good/fresh coffee if you're not willing to spend on it.  Go to Caribou, Starbucks, Coffee bean, Lavaza, Illy, Illak (Pun, not real), you name it. You'll see that the pack they sell you is months old (If not almost a year). A month or two is fine, 6 isn't (You can ask for when they're roasted, if not printed on the pack itself). It taste like old tyres juice (Especially Starbucks).  Go to Caribou and ask a barista to get you some coffee from the blend they sell in their brewed coffee (Not Americano... Seriously). They're much fresher and cost as much as 20kd~30kd a kilo. You can ask for 1/4 of that.  I personally prefer you go on with Coffee Villain. I personally tried them. I like them. I keep their coffee beans for special occasions, like, beating my wife in Worms Armageddon.  If you don't mind waiting, you can go with Stumptown Coffee Roasters. They roast it when you order it. I do order from them every once in a while."

Kuwait,30oo1u,DesertTwitch,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:53:13 2015 UTC,Have you only ordered from Stumptown? What about Blue Bottle?

Kuwait,30hjz1,SometimesLonely,2,Fri Mar 27 13:06:10 2015 UTC,"Hey. So I just became an 'open water' PADI certified diver a couple of weeks back. PADI certification is great because of their international reach and recognition.  So their license works virtually around the globe.  There are many PADI affiliated dive centres around Kuwait but the one I used was Nautilus Diving Centre. Great owner and great instructors (Syrian, Irish and Kuwaiti). I did it with a couple of my friends but you don't need anyone to enjoy it. A couple of girls were doing it by themselves with Nautilus. Was great fun and I would highly recommend it. Have fun!  Edit: You will have to do an online course at that start and it will cost you KD 40. Once you are done with it you have to give an exam at the dive centre (easy) and have to pay the remaining KD 100. TOTAL COST : KD 140. Now you have to keep in mind that you will have to buy your own 1. Scuba suit (required for cold water diving). 2. Goggles and snorkel. 3. Fins 4. Scuba shoes. All this cost me KD 98 ( bought from Nautilus centre and included a KD 20 scuba bag)."

This is walking, not sniffing shit under the fridge, where dogs have an advantage over us.  Just a piece of advice: If you have a dog but you're too lazy to walk it (or walk with it), then you have bigger priorities than having a dog in the first place."

Kuwait,2zgs39,The_Boudzter,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:02:47 2015 UTC,"I don't recommend that you take a bus.  It is better to take a taxi.  Since, all the meters are broken in all the taxis, you should pay him 1 KD per 15 minutes of driving.  Going to the Avenues from your location should cost 2 KD.  Make sure that you make the arragement before you even sit in the taxi.  Also, When you arrive at your destination, physically get out of the taxi before you pay him.  If he argues, then just slam the door and walk away since the price was already agreed upon prior. If you phone for a taxi, it is a different story and going to the Avenues might cost you about 10 KD."

If you're honestly being humble about it and not intentionally braggy, people will pick up on your earnestness and won't be offended at all.   There are still people who will think less of you for not speaking Arabic, but that's a declining minority these days.   I'm in a similar situation, and I found that showing a willingness to learn the language as you go also helps a lot.

Learning the language is not a difficult thing especially if you already know a little about it. People from all cultures and everywhere in the world don't usually respect those who live among them and don't speak their language. It is a sign that they are good as they are and they have little respect to the culture they're in they don't even want to bother and integrate themselves.

Kuwait,2z44d6,jaargraine,2,Sun Mar 15 11:11:16 2015 UTC,"A merchant family is a family that has some sort of commercial trade attached to its name like being the official representative/reseller in Kuwait for cars or electronics. Generally speaking they are ""a9eel"" because a9eel families have been here a long time and in the past they were also merchants (owned boats for fishing or perhaps trade routes to India as examples), so naturally they had the advantage when the newer companies wanted or had to choose who to resell their products in this region. This is what I understand but I could be wrong.  As for whether they have distinct cultures, no they are Kuwaitis after all so their culture is the same as the rest.   Are the new-money business families considered ''merchants''? There are conflicted accounts about the merchants.    I don't understand this."

Kuwait,2yxq2w,yah5,2,Sat Mar 14 09:08:11 2015 UTC,"The college of women is shit, stay away from it. Most students at the college of women are backward because only the extremely religious Kuwaitis put their daughters in that college. the college is girls-only and the professors there are just as backward as the students.  Foreign students are rarely granted scholarships in Kuwait, but there are universities in the West with scholarship programs that sponsor foreign students (e.g. Sciences Po in Paris and Fulbright Program in USA - through those university programs you can get a scholarship only if you plan on conducting political science research about Kuwait).  I think AUK does grant scholarships to foreign students, contact them if you want more information. But Kuwait is not a good place for those seeking higher education - most Kuwaitis prefer to study outside because Kuwait's universities are very overcrowded, there aren't enough places and resources for Kuwaitis let alone foreign students.  English is good enough. You probably won't be able to find work in Kuwait with your current degree. Even kuwaitis are struggling to find jobs in Kuwait."

It's a competitive environment and the government isn't going to waste its time helping non-Kuwaitis when there are so many Kuwaitis who still need financial help.  Kuwait's great if you wish to work in higher-education or are pursuing research on the region's politics, history and/or culture, but as a student who is neither a citizen (of either Kuwait or another GCC member-state) nor has family here to fall back unto it's not the best.
