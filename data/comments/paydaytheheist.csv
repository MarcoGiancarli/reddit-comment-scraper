It doesn't have to load an entire webpage and social media bullcrap to go along with the video, it automatically plays at the best quality available, it has 60fps even if you decide to upload in a much smaller quality, it auto loops without any visible break, it easily allows to to slow down or speed up the video, and I can save the video simply through the right click menu.

Not so much any questions that I'm actually even remotely interested in. I'm fine with them getting some time to prepare answers, but while the answers may scream PR response, the questions shouldn't.  I'm not there to watch people give Almir or whoever a verbal blowjob, I'm there because I want answers to questions even if they may not be the most convenient ones from Overkills standpoint.

paydaytheheist,3e1iai,xomm,3,Tue Jul 21 10:04:52 2015 UTC,Chimano Customs and Bernettis are the most efficient fyi.
paydaytheheist,3e1iai,vikingrGER,4,Tue Jul 21 06:21:03 2015 UTC,Interceptors are pretty much strictly superior to Bernetti. They trade a bit of ammo (which shouldn't be a problem in the first place) for unconditionally OHKOing greens and vastly higher accuracy.
paydaytheheist,3e1iai,Menolith,2,Tue Jul 21 15:41:37 2015 UTC,"At the moment I think the Interceptors are probably best for Ovk if you're using an explosive crossbow, or the Chimano Customs if you're using a HE Judge, to optimally reach 4 detection risk. On OVK aim for enough damage to 1-shot greens (33 I think?) with as much accuracy and mag size as possible as a secondary consideration. Lasers of some sort are a must. ALWAYS aim down sight."

Don't get cash off the bus in Rats day 3, don't cook meth on day 1/cook off, don't bag engines on Big Oil, just run bags back to the van on Shadow Raid.  For the bus on Rats day 3, I actually never got ON to the bus for a very long time due to fear of causing whatever it was that made the bus blow up.  Then I watched a video and thought ""really? that's it?  You just have to defuse c4 after picking up the cash?""  And now I wonder why the bus gets blown so often, because it's really not that difficult of a mechanic.  Shouldn't really happen to anyone except their first time, and that's if they have no idea there's going to be c4 there."

At least we think. We had 2 exsplosions in a row - even while we seemed to observe both players (one host, one non host) each player disarming the c4 the instant it appeared (it often did appear late)"
paydaytheheist,3dxi5i,mattbru77,10,Mon Jul 20 13:58:05 2015 UTC,This is why it's best for the heist's host to go in the bus and defuse the c4 solo and leave the defense/bags to the rest.  Usually the desync can be avoided this way.

paydaytheheist,3dxi5i,SavvySillybug,2,Mon Jul 20 22:59:34 2015 UTC,Most pub hosts I've encountered yelled at people for bagging it so I pretty quickly caught on to the idea of not bagging it.  Also some people shoot the hostage all the way down because they don't know how hostages work. Never do that. It delays assault waves forever and makes the heist easier. And any hostages closer than that one will be the first to be traded.

paydaytheheist,3dxi5i,dashieHD,-3,Tue Jul 21 00:41:04 2015 UTC,If you bag it and throw it on top of the shelf in the corner room with the camera controls in it the cops cant get it. Makes it easier to move out to the helicopter in the end too!  Also fire never gets in that room so no worries about it burning  EDIT: I guess cops can grab it off the shelf? Never experienced it myself though.
paydaytheheist,3dxi5i,KodekGB,11,Mon Jul 20 18:18:25 2015 UTC,the cops cant get it.   They often pick it up through the wall.

paydaytheheist,3dxi5i,SavvySillybug,5,Tue Jul 21 13:16:08 2015 UTC,"Explosives can knock it off the shelf quite easily, and the cops can get it. And they can carry it into the room, and get killed by the fire, and then the coke burns and everyone loses.  The helicopter can spawn on the other side of the appartment, and then it just got 70% harder to move all bags into the helicopter. Not to mention that it's annoying to get the bags down in the first place, I usually shoot an explosive arrow against the wall to get the money bags down if we got any on our way up, just because I dislike trying to get them from up high like that.  Meanwhile the coke desk is 100% safe from fire and cops, and exactly inbetween both helicopter spawns. You can bag and throw it outside in one swift motion, and it's right where it would be if you tossed it after you got it off the shelf, but regardless of which helicopter spawn is used."
paydaytheheist,3dxi5i,dashieHD,3,Mon Jul 20 18:22:06 2015 UTC,"Explosives can knock it off the shelf quite easily...   I'm sure this happens to some people, never experienced it   The helicopter can spawn on the other side of the apartment   I feel like it spawns on the left 9/10 times, but that is a fair point. Fairly easy for me to move the bags with a dodge build/speed perks tho. Same with grabbing them from off the shelf, just jump and grab one.   the coke desk is 100% safe from fire and cops, and exactly in between both helicopter spawns.   tru tru, can't argue that.  To each their own I guess, I hate going in that middle room at all tbh. The shelf works well for me but I get the benefits of leaving it on the coke table. I'll keep this in mind when I play pubs."
paydaytheheist,3dxi5i,SavvySillybug,2,Mon Jul 20 18:50:56 2015 UTC,"When you host, do whatever you prefer. But general consensus among pubs is to leave it on the table, and it's a safe choice. Picking it up will likely label you as a noob, and might even get you kicked.  I personally make sure to announce it beforehand that we should leave the coke on the table, and sometimes I kick those who do it anyway - less because it's terrible to pick up the coke, and more because if they can't follow basic instructions I don't want them in my team..."

I told him ""Don't be a little bitch. Live with your mistake and learn from it."" Host didn't kick him either, which I appreciate.  We proceeded to complete the rest of the mission and I like to think he won't mess up again.

paydaytheheist,3dxi5i,citodon,6,Mon Jul 20 13:28:01 2015 UTC,Shoot the windows of the bus out so you can throw them out quickly after grabbing. Open the lids to all the briefcases exposing all the money. Have your whole team on the bus and have a countdown to when everyone begins. Everyone then picks up 2 cases of money and throws the bag out of the nearest window. This is how I got the achievement. It also helps if someone has inspire just in case someone didn't make it off the bus in time.

It's a team oriented game, and if I don't have a team I'm playing with, it's in my interest to improve everyone else in the game.  This means ESPECIALLY in stealth stages I prefer when people goof that they stay so we can talk about what happened and why. Sometimes I know. Sometimes they have to tell me what happened just before the detect. In any event, I'd rather help you learn (even after you botched a pro mission) than have you go back into the pool of pugs ignorant.  That said, play around and make friends. There's people who are inexperienced and ""saw a guy do it this way"" and try to follow it like a bible.

You can't lose exp so just go for anything with decent rewards.  Mostly it just means doing overkill and not the difficulties below that. Deathwish has a huge ramp up in difficulty but hard-overkill is not actually all that different.  But yea, you can't go backwards, so as long as you complete some heists you will eventually get to 100."
paydaytheheist,3dzv5k,Viruzzz,9,Mon Jul 20 21:51:19 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that, the way the XP curve works, level 85 is roughly at 50% of the experience needed to reach level 100. You're not even halfway there!  If you really need XP fast, get a crew together and ECM rush Election Day. Even after the nerfs, it's still some of the fastest XP in the game. u/Viruzzz will be able to tell you more. I wouldn't do this though, it gets boring fast and it sucks the fun from the game.

paydaytheheist,3dzv5k,nathanj0872,2,Mon Jul 20 21:53:57 2015 UTC,"Well, first advice would be to just do different heists and have fun, but thats not what you asked. Rats with all loot (cook all meth, steal back meth, empty the bus) gives the most XP atm. Combine that with a 20/25% stealth bonus and your friends will be 100 in no time. For the 20% stealth bonus I would recommend Election Day cause both days can be done on lower difficulty in just a few minutes.  Other than that, Hotline Miami/Hoxton Breakout/Watchdogs give pretty decent XP  edit: Forgot about Cook Off. You can get all the xp you want depending on how long you're willing to cook"

They should just remove any negative multipliers and make the positive ones bigger. A +15% EXP bonus is nothing I would play Four Stores for, a +50% bonus however is quite a bit more.

paydaytheheist,3dy8dv,Viruzzz,16,Mon Jul 20 21:17:47 2015 UTC,You can phrase what the system does in two ways.  It discourages repeating heists extensively and it encourages playing heists you rarely play  or  It punishes playing heists you enjoy and forces you to play nonenjoyable heists to progress.  The thing is that those two actually both describe the system pretty well. sure one of them is emotionally loaded but regardless that is how a lot of people felt the system worked and made the game less fun. Any system that does that is really really really bad for a game like this.  The reduction in the percentages has pretty much entirely fixed it so group 2 doesn't exist anymore which is fantastic. It made the game better and I think reverting that change would be completely insane.

The only way to accumulate huge penalties is to play 1-2 heists exclusively. For xp farmers who want to be the max level as soon as possible this slows them down a bit and makes them overall enjoy the game's other heists and become all around better players. Or they could just keep grinding the same heist over again until they no longer get any xp and complain about it on reddit while only being ale to run around like a chicken with their head chopped off on Shadow Raid.

Since then many more heists have been added, but it was absolutely a problem back when we had about 3 viable heists for good experience. -30% on certain heists is still more than continuous +15% on several heists, that's the fault of the shitty heists not the good heists."
paydaytheheist,3dy8dv,ChiefChecker,-8,Mon Jul 20 16:48:34 2015 UTC,"The system was changed because everyone hated it and complained on the forums.   Can't go throwing around everyone so lightly since I am a part of the general collective that is everyone and I didn't hate it nor did I complain because I understood the mechanic and didn't play the same heist a million times in a row. At launch there were Bank Heists (4), Firestarter, Rats, Watchdogs, Framing Frame, Big Oil, Jewelry Store, Ukrainian Job, Four Stores, Nightclub, and Mallcrasher. Including the pro job variants that's 18 heat bonuses which I never once had more than one 10% penalty at a time. And when I had a penalty, I played something else because it was obvious.   What you don't seem to realize is how long I've been playing.   What you don't seem to realize is how long I've been playing. And I don't need a stupid flair to feign experience."
paydaytheheist,3dy8dv,BryJack,7,Mon Jul 20 17:32:33 2015 UTC,"Firestarter and rats were the only two to actually give reasonable enough experience to level with. The rest you might as well not play with how slow it was.   It's not a flair to feign experience, I've played since release, and even in beta.   Just because you never had a big penalty doesn't make it a good system. I didn't either, but I was level 100 for the most of it so it didn't affect me anyway. However, it only matters what the average player thinks and they absolutely hated it.   Putting high penalties on the high experience heists isn't a good solution, it just shows you how shitty other heists are that you can still level faster with -30 than doing other heists. That's a problem with balance."
paydaytheheist,3dy8dv,Somefive,10,Mon Jul 20 17:38:11 2015 UTC,One of the most stupid things with the heat bonus is that bought Heists count to the negative side but you can't get your positive heat bonus from a bought Heist. Really? With the fucked up crime.net that's just idiotic. I kept the negative bonus on Shadow Raid for months after I rushed to 25 with it.

I've got about 600 to 700 hours before infamy 2.0 and now I'm at 1200. I earned every single level of my 2600 and I probably put more time into this than most of the players you can meet on crime.net. Don't try to talk to me like that...   Is it my fault that Ovk added a new mechanic to the game which wasn't desirable at all and which you just wanted to skip? A mechanic wich a lot of players loathed? I don't know one guy who can genuinely say he found the new levels interesting, fun or just worth it.   I just cut the time for leveling as much as possible to come back to  the fun part of the game again.

paydaytheheist,3dy8dv,Paremo,5,Mon Jul 20 20:16:53 2015 UTC,Serious question. What's wrong with people only playing one or two heists? If a heist gives a stupid amount of cash or experience can't we simply fix that? How does it affect your game experience?
paydaytheheist,3dy8dv,Paremo,4,Mon Jul 20 16:46:43 2015 UTC,"There is nothing wrong with it at all, if they enjoy those heist's that much, let them keep playing it!  But what happens is that when they do decide to play a different heist, they have no idea what is going on and are generally unhelpful. They might be phenomenal at Rats but suck at Big Oil.  On OVKL and below its not such a big deal but when you get into DW lobbies you have a certain expectation that people you play with know how the heist is run."

paydaytheheist,3dy8dv,uss1701jb,2,Tue Jul 21 08:53:14 2015 UTC,"There is another downside: The viability of using crimenet to pick a game goes down even further.   During the double XP time, for example it was impossible to join a public shadow raid to stealth (and hosting one was kind of hard). That wasn't too bad, since only madmen would play shadow raid in a public game anyway, buy even earlier than that something kind of similar happened to rats with rushing.  Now you might not care to much about it, but I think OVERKILL cares a lot. Crime.net is one of the first things a new customer sees and if he leaves then and there because he has trouble finding a game he likes they won't sell anymore dlc. (The powergamers aren't the most accepting bunch either)."

paydaytheheist,3dysn8,PappyVonSnaps,-3,Tue Jul 21 05:05:31 2015 UTC,"No, you actually don't. Most you need is 14 point dodge, that's plenty enough for both DW and Overkill. I know, because I run it. The extra points that aren't wasted climbing a tree for 1/2 skills that I will never use, and never have used due to not needing them can be put to better use. For example, Masterforcer build (Inspire+Saw) with dodge, something generally not done pre-Grinder. Or a pretty much pure Tech-spec. LB and SB are both a waste, imo."
paydaytheheist,3dysn8,B11267,7,Tue Jul 21 00:40:59 2015 UTC,"The more dodge you get, the better is the dodge you get. 10% more is better the more you already have. To make up some numbers:  If you have 10% dodge, and get +10% dodge, you dodge 20% of all bullets. This doubles your dodge chance, but the bullets that hit you go down from 90% to 80% and that's just a tiny boost. You're still getting hit a lot.  If you have 80% dodge, and get +10% dodge, you dodge 50% more bullets, because 20% used to hit you, and now just 10% hit you, so that just doubled your dodge.  So while 10% may not sound like much, if you're already maxing your dodge elsewhere, this will matter much more than it seems at first glance.  I believe realistic numbers would be 65%-75% sprint dodge. It does not sound like much of a difference, right? But if you look at bullets that hit you instead of bullets that miss you, it becomes bigger.   100-65=35% of all bullets still hit you. 100-75=25% of all bullets still hit you.   You get 10% more dodge - but you get around 30% more effective health.  Yes, you can play without SB and LB. And I personally don't think LB is that useful. But dodge gets exponentially stronger the more you stack of it, so every point is worth it.  Just imagine if you had 98% dodge and could get +1% dodge. You'd outright double your effective health. You know - just to illustrate my point again. And another +1% dodge would actually make you invincible. Despite it still being just 1% dodge.  More dodge is strictly better dodge. And you can bring great weapons with low concealment still. An explosive bow, pistol skills, a 25 concealment Interceptor or LEO. Fugitive has a few bad skills way down, but you get such beauties as Swan Song and Bullseye. Swan Song is nice to murder whatever murdered you, get into a safe position for people to revive you, and if you still have time left, you can spam left click on the bow to generate some ammo for it. Bullseye is wonderful to reset your armor gate - doesn't matter that it's just 4 armor or so, it will stop everything short of a sniper bullet. There are a few skill points that could use better uses, but the higher tiered skills are absolutely, positively, wonderfully amazing.  And besides, with a well optimized build, you can get Swan Song, SB&LB, Bullseye, Run and Gun and Hidden Blade in Fugitive, medic bags, inspire and pistol skills in mastermind, and have enough points left to get shinobi, transporter, die hard, and stun resistance. And I don't know where else I would want to put those points.  Grinder has some powerful builds without the dodge, but that, in my opinion, is a combination of strong regen and the fact that your dodge doesn't get high enough that 10% start mattering. I personally like running grinder dodge anyway, but I've also enjoyed a Ghost build with ECM Feedback, because you really don't need points to make Grinder great. It also doesn't get much better with skill points, so there's that.  If there is one thing Grinder gives you, it is freedom. Freedom of movement, freedom to take damage, freedom to take whatever skills you like, freedom to take whatever gun you prefer. LBV with Bulletproof and C4? Why not! Regular Mindfug but with Grinder instead of Rogue? Why not! Mastertech with inspire and C4? Sounds fun! Ghost and enforcer? Well... I guess, if you feel silly?  Grinder is lovely. And I will admit that my earlier post was actually pretty wrong. ""You need all the dodge you can get if you run Grinder in a suit, though."" What was I thinking? Grinder doesn't need dodge, it just gets a little better with it."

paydaytheheist,3dysn8,stallon100,2,Mon Jul 20 19:29:21 2015 UTC,"Explosive bow is a fantastic support weapon, but not the best primary. Since it does not benefit from ammo pickups, you are completely reliant upon ammo bags. The refire is slow, and missing an arrow can be disastrous. You also have to 'reload' the arrow which takes a little getting used to at first.   As a support weapon, it is fantastic. It will one shot shields, as well as knock off dozer face shields with ease and at range. It is also extremely concealable, and works wonders with a dodge pistol build.  I use the explosive bow alongside a LEO in my fugitechmind build, but save explosive arrows for dozers and shields only.   edit: fugimind, not tech..."

paydaytheheist,3du4yh,SavvySillybug,4,Sun Jul 19 23:04:33 2015 UTC,"TF2 at least is funny about it. Most other games just scrap the blood and give us nothing in return.  Fallout: New Vegas doesn't let you gib humanoids. At all. This includes enemies in the DLC ""Dead Money"", who only really die when you gib them. It was... a little bit harder for me to complete that DLC. Killing Floor doesn't explode heads upon a headshot, it just makes the head collissionless and makes it fold backwards a little bit. I can never, ever properly tell if I shot their head off or not, and if I'm wasting my bullets still shooting at it. GTA: San Andreas took out two important things: kicking someone while they are down, and people dropping money when you kill them on the streets. This means two things very early on in the game: One mission where you are supposed to kill someone, and are given a baseball bat? He becomes immune to damage whenever you knock him over, which the baseball bat does a lot, so you'll have to wait a few second for him to recover before you can punch him again. The best solution is to just run him over with your car instead. The other thing it means? You rely entirely on jobs to get money. That early mission where the most expensive haircut gets a positive response from Ryder, and everything else makes him insult you? Yeah, you will have to do some taxi missions before that if you want to be able to hear that response, and you'll have to do some side missions constantly just to stay monetized. Also, there's apparently lines for picking up money, and the only place they still play is in a mission with a burning house in Los Santos where there's some money drops. I was quite surprised when I saw a money drop for the first time, and discovered that there was a line for picking it up, since it was apparently the only one in the entire game.  TF2 is pretty funny and honestly, compared to the other things they do in Germany? I can take it."

The skill gap between Overkill and Deathwish is huge. Like, with a proper build, and not making many mistakes, I could see myself soloing most Overkill heists. Deathwish? I want a highly specialized build, good teammates with equally specialized builds, and the right amount of skill... and then if everyone plays well it's not too hard.  I would like a gamemode that says ""challenging for pubs"" while still possible with your above average Overkill crew. And I would like a gamemode that says ""You really should not attempt this without perfect builds and Teamspeak"". Don't even give it achievements. Just make it exist so people can get their 320 noscope MLP progamer skillz on.  I want a difficulty that I can look up to, not one that's the next step up the ladder. When I finally get all the Deathwish missions done, I want to feel great. But DW is not hard enough to be the end-all be-all with all the updates that made people stronger.  But I also want a step inbetween Overkill and Deathwish. Overkill is so trivial I'll test a random build out on it, and take two people along who have no perk decks and a random mush of skill points anywhere they please. As long as I'm bringing one explosive gun and Inspire, I can carry confidently. Deathwish needs so much skill, experience, and good builds that I feel bad for hosting it, because I'll likely be kicking anyone below infamy 3. You just don't get a decent DW build going without infamy. You just, don't.  I vote for two more difficulties. Heck, make the harder one a DLC if you like. I'd buy it. But I want something in between DW and Overkill so I can take serious builds for a spin without bringing my ace game and kicking stupid people all the time."

Vaults are in different places, doors are reinforced, escape vans get turned around and spend a minute coming through the other alley, the passcodes don't work and bain frantically spends a couple minutes making social engineering calls for a new one a la hoxrev's keycode.

paydaytheheist,3dw34o,Somefive,4,Mon Jul 20 13:09:54 2015 UTC,PD2 also has such a event on Hotline Miami day 2. There is a high chance that three Bulldozers will be on the top floor near the vault. Sadly Dozers in PD2 are a joke :(
paydaytheheist,3dw34o,SgtTittyfist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:20:33 2015 UTC,"The 145+ dozers were basically sprinting saigadozers (afaik if you have <80% health it's one hit to take down armour one hit to take you down), and the GL40 didn't stun them."
paydaytheheist,3dw34o,Somefive,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:51:43 2015 UTC,"I just got my golden masks in PD:TH (Heat Street can go fuck itself) and I really have to say that Bulldozers aren't a big threat. The problem is that the M308, which is obviously the best weapon in the game, is also the best way to deal with them. Only 13 headshots and he is dead, while your mag holds a whopping 16 rounds. If even two guys focus fire on him he is dead within just a second. The only truly threatening thing is that he essentially one shot drops you if your armor is gone. They are still much bigger threats than the PD2 Dozers with DLC, but much less than them if you don't own any.  Also armor isn't directly related to your health in PD:TH by the way. The way they made the enemies hit harder is quite fascinating. On easy your armor is as powerful as ~25% of your maximum health (excluding Thick Skin), while on OVK145+ it's only as strong as ~2.5% of your maximum health. Having less than 100% health won't weaken your armor."

The AK begs to differ. The entire technician weapons are about high power/low ammo efficiency weapons, and the AK doesn't fail to disappoint. It just doesn't have the ammo handling or accuracy of the m308, but it has much more damage and RoF.   If even two guys focus fire on him he is dead within just a second.   Assuming you don't get ambushed by two dozers in the remaining time, considerng there isn't just one, but four dozers in the vault.   The only truly threatening thing is that he essentially one shot drops you if your armor is gone.     He takes out ~80% your health last time I checked, I have survived dozer hits with no armour on 145+, though I had full health beforehand.   Also armor isn't directly related to your health in PD:TH by the way. The way ....   I'm aware. I said <80% health because that's the amount of health you need to withstand a hit with no armour.    Having less than 100% health won't weaken your armor.   Yup, however the screen flares red faster, but your armour is constant. No Arguement there."
paydaytheheist,3dw34o,Somefive,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:52:53 2015 UTC,"The M308 is the best weapon. It's really not debatable. It has no recoil, flawless accuracy, fast reloads and more than enough ammo. If you got a good trigger finger it will outmatch the AK in terms of DPS.   As much as I prefer the Reinback and AK myself, the M308 is simply the best weapon. Stat."
paydaytheheist,3dw34o,SgtTittyfist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:56:07 2015 UTC,"It's highly debateable, there's a lot better balance in PD:TH than in Payday 2. The downside of the LMG is the accuracy Reinback has the accuracy it needs with proper recoil, single action reloads (makes back-jump sprinting and whatnot pairable with reloads at an advanced speed) but is nerfed by the ammo pool of M308 (which, unlike the Reinback can't OHKO heavies on 145+) AMCAR has more ammo, is even more accurate (granted it applies in like, one spot, but still) but has significantly less damage. I'll take the AK for sheer power any day, and for Tromboncino's FWB 145+ run he took it too.  The Bronco has taken the meta because the BS-9 is BS, Stryk has not enough ammo relative to a full clip, and crosskill is just weaker. The GL40 isn't always used, except in solo play, where it provides the edge you need against shields. The Mark 11 is silenced (ie No Mercy stealth advantage) has a high RoF and the Compact-5 is basically inverted from PD2.  Eh .. Locomotive has too much dropoff."
paydaytheheist,3dw34o,Somefive,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:12:34 2015 UTC,"You simply must realize that you are not playing to your full potential without the Bronco/M308/GL40 combo. It's similar to how the CAR-4 and Commando 553 compete in PD2. Both are very powerful, but many would argue that the CAR-4 is still the superior weapon. The AK in PD:TH is certainly a good gun, but it has to compete with the M308, which it simply can't."
paydaytheheist,3dw34o,clipninja,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:18:24 2015 UTC,"The codes not working is almost a guarantee, it's easy enough to do the heist solo because of how easy it is to kite on Diamond.  The 4 dozers can change the technique from 3 holding while one person snags the loot, to two holding and two snag the loot. IMO it wasn't much of a difference, though it would be nice to see 4 dozers in vaults on deathwish."
paydaytheheist,3dw34o,joethehoe27,15,Mon Jul 20 19:56:49 2015 UTC,"I feel like all difficulties should be rebalanced, not just OVK, DW, or something inbetween. There's no reason beyond learning how to play the game to play on any difficulty below OVK, and even then normal and hard are basically for players just starting. Very Hard should be at, if not close to, where OVK is at right now. Hard could be a bit harder, but not as hard as Very Hard. OVK would become the new inbetween, not easy as shit but not hard as balls, and DW - well, I don't know about that. Maybe more DW-only things - Stuff like the bridge missing on Watchdogs day 1. DW exclusive events that make the game slightly more difficult simply because of a strategy shift or the requirement of extra skill.   P.S. - Normal still has SWAT turrets, right? That's pretty dumb for the newbie difficulty."
paydaytheheist,3dw34o,clipninja,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:15:21 2015 UTC,I think it's important for the easiest difficulties to have toned down mechanics of the harder difficulties.  That way new players have a chance to learn without being punished too hard

Very Hard needs some tweaking done to make it harder, but that's about it."
paydaytheheist,3dw34o,DerFelix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:56:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I frequently see people who are level 30 in OVK games and they manage to do okay.  Five difficulties is plenty. Just because someone is experienced at first-person shooters doesn't mean you should be able to skip to the fourth difficulty after a day of playing.

But going on the internet and finding the perfect build is making it easy for you. People spent a lot of time thinking about and testing builds until they found stuff like the dodge builds. If you are new to Deathwish you are going to fail a lot. But if you find the quirks of the game of course after a while you know how it's done. If you play enough even notoriously hard games like Dark Souls will seem easy to you. That's practice and doesn't mean the game is too easy.  If you look at stats like achievements you will see that almost nobody can do Deathwish, so the people posting here are harcore fans and don't see that for most people Deathwish is something they will never achieve.  On topic: I think you are right that there should be a difficulty like that, simply because Deathwish is basically just too many enemies with too much health that do too much damage. There is nothing that really changes about how the game works, you just have to minimise damage to yourself. The health differences alone are a huge jump and I think the game would be more fun if you have more room to experiment with builds and items but still have a challenge."

Deathwish with optimized builds is still (arguably) easier than hard difficulty in PD:TH in my opinion, which means lots of experienced players in the previous game can do well in the second. In about half the maps, there's usually a really good point to hold, meaning deathwish is easier.  While I'm not saying deathwish is ""easy"", I'm saying it's certainly doable if you play smart without a perfect build. An awful lot of failures IMO come from people moving off or going Rambo. Stay as a pack, use cover, and communicate, and deathwish should be doable enough by average players on ~75-80% of the maps."
paydaytheheist,3dw34o,Heroic_Sheperd,7,Mon Jul 20 11:44:03 2015 UTC,"I'd rather they tweaked the damage a bit for OVK, there's not much of difference between Very Hard and Overkill. Have Skulldozers spawn on OVK for a start.   I'd also love them to buff dozers. I've been saying they should make dozers immune to stun effects and take 75% less damage from explosives. HE rounds and other explosives made it far too easy to steamroll over everything, especially dozers who can be stunned for a silly length of time, plus it would make sense because they wear bomb disposal suits."

I don't like to play DW, I think difficulty isn't about making you ultra-vulnerable or making enemies bullet sponges, it has to be more elaborate. Deathwish is too tense for me with all the frailness of the player, takes away all the enjoyment, while overkill is nowhere near the challenge it once was some time ago. A mid-ground would be very welcome, it would surely renew the game."
paydaytheheist,3dw34o,thepedge,11,Mon Jul 20 01:06:30 2015 UTC,"In my opinion; no. If we keep releasing new difficulties the entire system will be pretty FUBAR. Hard's too easy and Very Hard is too hard, let's make a new difficulty called Kinda Hard. Not that I'm tryin' to be insulting or anything as I do agree with some of what ya said though.  But I feel like they could just beef up overkill ever so slightly. I'm not talkin' 'bout making enemies hitting harder or having more health, although that'd be the simplest way of doin' it, I mean make the AI emulate what it does on DW.  Make it so Tazers and Shields team up. Make it so cops priortize getting near/around shields. Make Cloakers more aggressive when 'dozers or other specials are near. That'd give overkill more of a challenge compared to say Hard/very hard without just making cops harder to kill or making them hit harder, which I personally feel is a poor way of doing difficulty, and it'll make overkill more challenging without ostracizing the people who've learned the breakpoints or make weapons irreverent like deathwish can. That'd be something I'd be excited for.  TL;DR: We shouldn't just be adding more difficulties because the ones we have arn't adequate; Just give the cops on Overkill DW AI or something similar."

I don't like to think of levels as how good the player is but that usually the truth as higher levels are more experienced.
paydaytheheist,3dw34o,bveccy,3,Mon Jul 20 11:19:08 2015 UTC,"I think OVK needs to be a bit harder, maybe DW slightly harder too, although that is arguable.  When you have the right guns, build and tactics for a mission you could quite easily solo OVK. But if you tried the same on DW you would get destroyed. It's a totally different playstyle you need because the gap is that big.  There are obviously those who have mastered DW and can be seen soloing that, but I feel they are a very small amount of individuals compared to those that could on OVK.  One of the problems with it now is because people can carry on OVK, someone can be finding it easy yet making a ton of mistakes or poor choices that they don't really get punished for. So when they go to DW they try the same thing and it will punish you"
paydaytheheist,3dw34o,AOF_Semiramis,2,Mon Jul 20 01:53:30 2015 UTC,"A difficulty level between OVK and DW would be an interesting addition, I'd perhaps suggest changing the spawn rates and using the stronger special units from DW with Greens and Tans from OVK.  I'd also like to see some tweaks elsewhere, removing SWAT Turrets from Normal, increasing the spawn rates on Hard and adding a bit more to DW with map and objective changes. I'd like a game mode that was more difficult not because everything could take twice the damage and deal more out, but because you had to coordinate to complete objectives as a team. I like the fact that there are Titan cameras and safes, but I'm sure they could do more with each map."

Oh god I can't stand the invisible walls in payday ... yeah, I hate that. Fortunately I bring my scarysaw on these heists and I can keep them intimidated at a distance, but it shouldn't be a necessity.  Ideally a punishment or reward would be more severe on stealth attempts, seeing as those occasions are where they're killed the most."
paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,SavvySillybug,2,Mon Jul 20 05:12:07 2015 UTC,"Should there be more punishment, or less punishment, for killing a tied civilian? First I'm thinking, if you're going to tie your civs, you can lead them somewhere safe and away from the fire, so it's easier to avoid the penalty and it should be higher if it still happens.  But then I thought people would associate cable ties with harder punishments and just not tie them at all..."

It bothers me when people feel a necessity to kill civs when it is entirely unnecessary. There are some cases I can sympathize with, and even those are few and far between, but just killing every civ for no reason whatsoever extremely bothers me. And this is coming from a guy who has been here since beta. When you could not move civs, and when CF was still a tier six skill. Even with those complications I was not a fan of it, but at this point, with all we have gotten to deter civ killing, it just bothers me incredibly."

I do not care about losing money, it just feels incredibly unprofessional. Different playstyles though, I respect that others do it, nothing I can do about that (other than asking others not to do it in my lobby). But, yeah, I get that some people only do it because they do not need money, so they just get them out of the way to complete the heist. It is just that it does not feel as much as a success to me- finishing the heist clean without any unnecessary civilian deaths is more of an achievement to me than finishing a heist with a pile of civilian corpses."

paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,uberJames,9,Mon Jul 20 05:06:54 2015 UTC,"If we buffed/fixed the way civilians behave to compensate that would be fine. I get enough of civilians rushing into the middle of gunfights (or worse, Tazers forcing me to kill them by accident) or running out of ties between 4 people with 24 total (cough Go Bank), or civilians spawning out of bounds and becoming instantly alerted and forcing me to kill them, or civilians like the tellers in Harvest and Trustee that completely ignore you and rush the panic button. It'd get pretty irritating if I had to take additional punishment for situations I was essentially forced into. Other than that the penalty could stand to be changed."

paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,DemosthenesKey,4,Mon Jul 20 13:23:55 2015 UTC,"I suppose it should stick to something which applies to the individual who is 'killing' civilian(s).   What would be an interesting concept however, avoiding further penalties, could be the ability to simply 'maim' a civilian. Out of ties? Just melee that sucker into submission without actually killing them.   I understand melee already can 'control' a standing civilian, and this could eliminate cable ties completely, but why not build into an existing skill such as 'Cable Guy' or 'Control Freak'. Literally just a sudden concept that sprung to mind."
paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,gam3addict,3,Sun Jul 19 23:11:28 2015 UTC,"Being able to perma-maim seems a little too powerful since - as you mentioned - it would make cable tying redundant. Though I like the line of thought - some kind of ""knock-out"" skill for enforcer that disables a civilian for a period of time (could be anywhere from 5 minutes to 10, and have some random variation). Make it something that can only work once on each civilian before the knock-out kills them when attempted the second time. Or maybe let it be used multiple times but only last a minute or two before it needs to be reapplied.  Good point on the punishment though - cash penalty only applies to the killer, so that makes sense."
paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,NimbleJack3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:02:03 2015 UTC,"My only gripe with having something that penalises the team, is sometimes you can help the odd civilian that makes a mad run after being untied, or sometimes you just get the odd grenade that didn't go as far. Not to mention, there may be some individuals more than happy to put everyone else at that disadvantage, but oh well.  Although I approve the idea of the civilian being 'unconscious' for a period of time, maybe displaying a 'Zzz' rather than a '!' or '?' above their head. So long as the police could still revive and release them like they would if just cable tied.   It may not even answer your original question of penalising more heavily those who do kill civilians, as I approve of that idea myself (With no concept, unfortunately).   But, food for thought, no?"
paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,shaft169,4,Mon Jul 20 11:26:43 2015 UTC,"It's a hard thing to adjust, mainly because additional costs are a non issue once you've played the game for a while. There's even a skill in the Fugitive tree that reduces the costs by 75% to make it even less of an issue. As for XP, people would just end up playing different heists if they were trying to level fast, although that's pretty much the case right now.  Additional rewards wouldn't necessarily work either, more money is no big deal for a lot of players, nor is the XP. If the XP buff was huge then it would unbalance other heists which don't have any hostages, or the need to tie them. Even if you did something like making them harder to control the more you kill, say if you kill 3 then they're all going to try and phone the police, you'd just get more massacres of all the civs.  Maybe they could put a side job in? Keep x civs alive and escape? Could work, offers weapon mods as a reward, but for certain players this still wont mean anything so they'll just kill them.  Could try making heists require you to keep a certain number alive before the police are automatically called? Not a fan of this idea, but it's a possibility.  Killing a certain amount could trigger an escape, even after a stealth heist. Again not a huge fan, but it could deter people, especially if you're stealthing DW.  I'm not sure there really is a solution, so I'd probably just do whatever you feel is right and ignore the fact that other people want to kill them."
paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,Aku230,4,Mon Jul 20 01:34:26 2015 UTC,"How about instead of punishing players for not wanting to deal with the borderline vegetable-stupid civilian AI, we are given tools to deal with them more reliably? Or maybe, idk, drastically reduce the likelihood of a civ trying to use their phone. Or let us take their phones from them. Or let us buy a zip tie bag deployable.

Not only you have to deal with different detection mechanic as client, civvies not doing what you want them to do but now you also can't kill them because you will be punished. Also I have a feeling that problem mostly exists on maps where you can dominate whole map, most notable H&T that has terrible map design by forcing you to wait for drills to finish while nothing can happen.

paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,psxsquall,3,Mon Jul 20 07:39:45 2015 UTC,"If you think about it, it's a game and in games players try to make the rules work for them as much as they can (not everybody of course). In the end, it's easier to just kill everybody, because the game incentivises it! It takes a bit of your money but it's a huge trouble off your mind.  Simply put, I would like it if they penalise it more ONLY if they actually give us good tools to manage them. E.g. give everybody more cable ties. Or make taking them to other places actually work. I hate that you can only take one, that they are always too slow and always get stuck, basically it's easier to kill them and then put them in a bag. Frankly, I think you should be able to carry hostages without them being dead."

paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,ThatFoxyBastard,2,Mon Jul 20 11:57:49 2015 UTC,"Instead of exp, or a cash deduction change. It should increase the number of specials PER assault. If you kill 10 civis, there are 10 more specials you get to deal with. 4 Shields, 3 tazers, 2 cloakers and 1 dozer.   The sequence could follow something like this: S T S C S |  T S T C D  Each civilian is another step up, kill 20 civis (some how) you're at 8 shields, 6 tazers, 4 cloakers (good luck) and 2 extra dozers.  Sure killing them ""causes"" snipers to spawn and increases the wait time for being traded. Minor kicks in the long run.  The payday gang being merciless should increase the moral of the cops. They wanna take down these guys! Look at how much damage they are causing to the citizens!! Rawr! So bad! This could translate to them being harder to dominate, suppress and more likely to group up and function like they would on higher difficulties."
paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,morerokk,3,Mon Jul 20 02:28:54 2015 UTC,"This would only work if it applied to the NEXT mission, as it would never apply to the current.

paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,InternetTAB,2,Mon Jul 20 02:57:42 2015 UTC,Applying to the next heist wouldn't work well. Nobody wants to get their ass kicked in pubs because some guy that just murdered a bunch of civs the last heist joined your game.

paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,lordzygos,2,Mon Jul 20 03:29:04 2015 UTC,"As mentioned, it doesn't really fix the problem since killing civilians is mostly used to keep things from going loud. Ideally, a punishment for killing them would be making stealth harder in some way.   Possibly some kind of ""brutality"" penalty which occurs at the end of a heist if a civillian is killed. Stealth bonuses apply to the next heist for more XP - a brutality penalty could apply to the next stealthable heist and increase the number of guards and cameras which spawn. After all, there's a dangerous criminal killing people and stealing shit from stores - beefing up security for a while seems plausible. Let the penalty disappear after completing another heist.  It doesn't effect money or XP which some players give no fucks about, but it inconveniences the crap out of them if they want to go from one stealth heist to another by forcing them to take more difficulty or do another heist in between."

paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,dive_bomber,2,Mon Jul 20 17:20:58 2015 UTC,"The best solution imo is to add an Escape chance per civi killed. This way an accidental one here or there won't be a problem, but if you shoot up everyone, you'll have a bad day. You could also make it a threshold, where if you kill more than X civis it is guaranteed, but under that nothing happens.   Either way, with a bunch of people dead, friends and family will start panicking and the police will put 2 and 2 together. In a city with famous murder-hobo heisters, if your husband goes to the bank and doesn't answer his phone, its a safe bet there's a robbery. Bam, now the cops are chasing you and you have an Escape sequence."

If you kill all the civis to make things easier, you get to deal with the escape. You COULD just quit, but then you get nothing from the heist. You could also build for it, and have a Combat ready build when you stealth. Then once you trigger the escape, you might survive it.   No matter what you do though, killing civis would not be the easy way anymore"
paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,Z0mb13S0ldier,2,Mon Jul 20 18:01:52 2015 UTC,"Ahem... Its already in the game. From Long Guide: ""Heists usually have a chance of about 10% to 25% to have an escape level if alarm went off (if the heist does support escapes at all). Every dead civilian adds 5% to this chance. The expert driver asset removes the chance entirely. If there are several possible escapes, they are all equally likely to occur. """
paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,PureKrogan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:09:08 2015 UTC,Only if the alarm went off.  We're talking stealth with no alarms.
paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,godsavant,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:13:49 2015 UTC,"Welp, there was nothing said about steath, so i just assumed he was talking in general. Well, not a bad idea then. However, stealth builds usually have Control Freak aced, and simply buying an expert driver should still eliminates the chance entirely. I would rather prefer a simple instant alarm, once you kill more than 4 civies, with a simple message like ""Someone detected criminal activity"".  HOWEVER - This is probably is not a solution either, since then GO Bank would be a total mess to stealth. It would be way more fun, ofc, but... I don't think anyone except a few people from reddit would be glad to hear that."
paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,SirGaz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:47:11 2015 UTC,But the chance only exists if you go loud right? I would want it to trigger regardless of whether or not the alarm sounds

paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,Hoxtalicious_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:15:54 2015 UTC,"While you can't particularly blame people for going all Mr Blonde on Bank Heists and such, I feel that just killing every last civvie detracts from the gameplay. Personally, it's the same reason I don't enjoy ECM rushing: it takes away from the challenge and feel of the game, but this is just subjective opinion.  I think it's quite obvious that the cash penalty is pointless unless you're at the lowest of low levels, and an additional penalty or incentive is needed to achieve the desired result.  In short: Either add a percentage XP/payout reduction per civvie killed, or provide incentives to control civilians by adding an XP/payout boost per civvie ""under control"" (tied up or shouted down) when you escape."
paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,MrTroll12345,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:08:19 2015 UTC,"I wish it was like on GTA V (at least on heists where you go loud and kill civs), where you kill only one and a stronger police force comes after you.  I mean bain says when we kill civs that they will send stronger units... but it doesn't happen, at all. If killing civs on loud actually made more specials or more units spawn, people would stop killing them."
paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,kostrubaty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:27:04 2015 UTC,"No, they wouldn't. More spawns = more fun. Killing civs in loud doesn't matter, they're gone pretty quickly and most kills are accidents. Killing civilians is only a problem in stealth, because it's outright skipping a game mechanic for small irrelevant penalty.   Even control freak actually requires some effort; killing everyone so you literally cannot lose anymore seems super noobish. Everyone can kill all civs on GO Bank and claim they ""stealthed"" it, boo fuckin hoo, it's impossible to lose if you kill everything that could have raised the alarm."

paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,Individuo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:26:16 2015 UTC,"No, make the heist go loud if you kill enough. The best solution, because you can ""get out of jail free card"" your way out of this one with money/exp/irrelevant shit. Or mandatory escape, even in stealth. Basically, I want penalties to be actually relevant and to affect everyone, don't give experienced players free pass.  Or maybe make it DW-only, so if you want to you can still stealth the old way on OVK and below. I am sure there is elegant way to do this."
paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,Shady_Love,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:31:49 2015 UTC,"How about making it so killing a certain number of civs on lower difficulties ups the risk rating, but without the bonus from said risk rating. Let's say you're on very hard, and you kill 3 or 4 civilians, the heist will be switched over to Overkill, but it'll still compensate you like a very hard heist would.   If you kill a certain number of civs on Deathwish, just have the heist fail, like how it does when you blow up the rats meth lab."
paydaytheheist,3dvr4v,Vandalier,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:03:45 2015 UTC,Civs being killed typically only happens during stealth. The increase in risk won't make anything harder unless the map will begin to shift mid-heist by causing doors to disappear and stuff.

Ironically, fewer civilians die if I'm going guns blazin. In that case, I just want to hear ""the police just freed another civilian."" Good!

Set it to something reasonable, though, we all know that sometimes there's just no other way.  Shooting civs can actually be considered an exploit. You get penalized for it, so obviously they don't want you to do it, but they failed to make penalities relevant."

Fair enough if you don't want to, but this is a game where you play as psychopathic mass murdering criminals, don't be surprised that wanton civilian casualties are going to happen.   They are a threat to the crew, they would call the cops given the chance, so they have a bullet in the brain coming to em."

(I could pack about a million of them in my backpack). Maybe an unlimited amount but give them a chance to break free or pull out a phone even when tied. If you shoot someone who is calling police it will deter everyone else from doing that. Fix the fucking pathfinding for AI. Let me lead more than one of those fuckers at gunsight.

Last night I was doing HoxBreak on OVK with pubs. There was this one player (we all know the type) running around the map trying to get his killcount/e-peen up. Running downstairs in the lobby, running towards the entrance etc. He went down near the entrance and I was getting annoyed and told him to stay with the group and to do objectives.  He answered: 'Why? This game is too ez, why don't you do DW-pro instead?'  I was still mad at him and was going to start a rant in chat but then it I realized he was totally right and hit my backspace-button.  At this moment the gap between OVK and DW is getting bigger and bigger with every weapon pack. Almost every special can be dealt with solo and there is absolutly no punishment for running around like a headless killwhoring chicken on ovk.  Doing DW with pubs on the other hand results in failure 50% of the time. When was the last time you wiped on ovk?   TL:DR: OVK fix the gap between ovk an DW so players learn to play as a team again"

Anyway, opened it up to the public so we can all grab jewelry bags and leave.  One guy starts drills when the pilot says he'll be there in one minute.  Then, one goes downstairs for some inexplicable reason and gets downed.  Drill guys goes down to help, helps him up, then they both get downed.  I tell the other guy to just wait for them to die ,then we rush the escape point.  Instead, he jumps over the railing into the midst of 2 bulldozers, 2 tasers, 3 shields, and a buttload of other enemies in an attempt to get to the other 2 downed people.  They get mad when I don't come to rez them.    Most pubs I've played with have been at least half as competent at the game as I am (which is not saying so much as I've not even done half of the heists properly and have trouble solo Overkill on many of them) but rarely do I get to see people fail so hard so quickly."

paydaytheheist,3dvkew,Joy1337,2,Sun Jul 19 23:37:33 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with ""playing the objective is more important"" but Meltdown is one of the few heists where the entire team is required for maximum objective efficiency.  Killwhoring might be douchey, but it keeps cops off of the team. Gives you more room for those objectives."
paydaytheheist,3dvkew,Cloymax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:42:17 2015 UTC,"I know the feel, I've had to play out way too many lobbies like it was a solo game. However, from playing so many shitty pubs I've found it easier to not stick with the dipshits. At the first sign that the game is going to be a struggle, I switch off and ignore the other guys. If they are high levels all I can think of is lazy play, but I try and help those who look like they genuinely don't know what is going on.  But grinder seems to be doing that to my overkill play, it's more fun to work with the team but running a self sufficient build gives the option to ignore them if they can't be fucked doing anything."

The simple fact is that waiting in a room for the assault to end/the next objective to start can get very boring."
paydaytheheist,3dvkew,MutantDemocracy,-1,Mon Jul 20 06:19:19 2015 UTC,"Some optional lobby features, such as an objective-specifier lobby could be really useful with this.  It'd be a new lobby type, in which you get the chance to give each player an ""objective name-tag"" which indicates what exactly his job is.  The lobby would be optional so unexperienced players can't stumble upon it accidently. A minimum infamy level could help with that aswell, although I've seen many bad infamy players in the last few months, so maybe just somehow make the feature hardly accessable, so only the players who really want it can find out how to use it."

Especially when we did this heist, I was just a bit outside the wall for  deathwish-loud heists..  myself with literally half of a DW Build (but I had inspire, so it was solid), and a friend with a level 60 ghost/fugitive STEALTH loadout (Who was objectively even less experienced than myself with loud heists, and had never seen the heist before) managed to clear the thing in about an hour, with few restarts.  The heist gave us the vault in the back corner of the warehouse, which makes fantastic cover and is insanely easily defended by two players. The rest of the heist was just cheesing things with dodge, and slowly consuming our doctor bags/4 FaK's.  it took us forever, and it WAS hell, but we were so impressed with our lack of skillpoints, proper firearms, and general experience that we wrote the whole mission off as 'probbably the easiest DW  heist'.

The video is a middle ground between being relative to new players while showing off potentially hard content to more experienced ones. We recorded four different heists some of them you see in the 'bonus round' these didn't make the cut because new players or people who don't play Payday could get lost.  The facts in the video are correct, I assume that this is a tip Ding thanks.

If you're trying to appeal to higher end players, you need to do deathwish (I noticed the Cook off was on Overkill).  A good way to appeal to people looking to lift their game is to go into detail about some tips. For instance the phone one; you said it raises alarm if unanswered but causes a random event if answered.  You could explain that you can get the blackmailer, who demands a bag of cash. Hilary's 3 different lines (gensec, no gensec, timelock codes). and Captain Rogers 2 calls, where first he sends 3 officers (with no pagers) and the second where he tells you how long before he raises the alarm.  Also tips like ' No more civilians spawn once the vault is opened'.  But that's just me, and what I'd like to see, it really depends on your target audience."

paydaytheheist,3dxm8j,Adam123ABC,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:04:28 2015 UTC,Although I'm on Crimewave so I have no idea about the Go bank and how to stealth it so I cannot comment on your methods what I can say is to stay away from mods as to this day I have no clue what a few things mean on HoxHud for example as it is quite cluttered although useful when you know how to use it. So my advice is to stay away from mods and if you're looking for a console audience stay away from content we do not yet have as it would mean little to us.
paydaytheheist,3dxm8j,Adam123ABC,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:43:16 2015 UTC,"Hey,   Thanks for your comment, however this is completely un-modded just PC game play. Could you elaborate to us what you think the mod was? so we can help you understand. :)"

paydaytheheist,3duchb,mehtastic,3,Sun Jul 19 18:28:51 2015 UTC,After update 11 they would down you from max health with a single bullet.

paydaytheheist,3duchb,mehtastic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:29:50 2015 UTC,"No, it took two shots with full armor."
paydaytheheist,3duchb,SavvySillybug,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:32:54 2015 UTC,"Even now they're pretty strong, and have killed me often when I ignored them for too long because I thought they were just regular cops. I'm not certain how much weaker they are now."
paydaytheheist,3duchb,mehtastic,5,Sun Jul 19 18:38:12 2015 UTC,They do a max of 100 damage per shot.  So if you're at full health with no armor it'll take 3 shots.  They do a lot of damage but it's not the tactical nuclear weapons they had before.
paydaytheheist,3duchb,SavvySillybug,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:40:33 2015 UTC,"That's still quite a bit if you're running a dodge build and get unlucky. Or even worse, get damaged by a lesser shot first, and it stacks because the bronco shot is more damaging.  So it's about a third as powerful as it used to be now? Sounds dangerously awesome."

paydaytheheist,3duchb,Alpha_MK-II,5,Sun Jul 19 17:47:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, having a full secondary no longer causes the ""overflow"" ammo to be given to your primary?"
paydaytheheist,3duchb,Menolith,3,Sun Jul 19 19:11:16 2015 UTC,Nope. I'm pretty sure they tried to fix used saw blades vacuuming ammo drops and entirely forgot that if a gun doesn't get a pickup that might be because it has six shells in reserve.
paydaytheheist,3duchb,SavvySillybug,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:27:37 2015 UTC,"By the sound of things, they've always been, and more then likely always will be, a niche appeal distraction sort of thing at best."
paydaytheheist,3duchb,Menacebi,3,Sun Jul 19 16:13:02 2015 UTC,"They are good for achievements where you have to defend a power box, because they don't suffer from desync. Doing those with people just means they will see a cop on the horizon, and the power box gets disabled.  They are sometimes good for keeping the cops busy. They're good on Firestarter day 1, just put them down while you carry bags, and they'll keep the copy busy enough while you run off with the bags.  They're also good for when you hate ammo and like eating ammo bags to refill your sentry.  Generally, Joker is an all around better skill. It's a 'sentry' that moves, has infinite ammo, you still get your deployable slot for other things, you can make more of them whenever you get a cop. With the tazer, it's easier than ever to convert cops. Joker takes less skill points to max out, and you can still ace Inspire in the top row, so you get something great out of the climb of the Mastermind skill tree."
paydaytheheist,3duchb,Gumbink,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:14:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they actually work very well for that role. But they cost 40 skill points to be useful..."

paydaytheheist,3duchb,OVERKILL_Almir,3,Sun Jul 19 21:46:34 2015 UTC,"Never meant to imply it wasn't, honestly. From what I hear, shotgun range damage drop-off wasn't a thing before Patch 11, so Mosconi was essentially the closest thing to a sniper rifle back in the day. I mean, it's still a fairly nice weapon now - but in a very niche sort of way. Outside of running a dodge build, there's no real reason to use it anymore - if you want to use it on something other then a concealment-based build, just use the Josaline."
paydaytheheist,3duchb,Newbrage,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:05:03 2015 UTC,"The range damage dropoff was a thing, but it happened at such long ranges that it did not matter.

That 30 extra armor from Thick Skin and LBV isn't worth it IMO, Most things will hit you for 50 damage making that extra 30 armor pointless.  If you were focusing on armor then why didn't you ace die hard and get that 15% armor recovery. I would switch bullet storm for Die hard. This is the Masterforcer Grinder build I use on deathwish But thats because I primarily use snipers and shotguns.  Edit: On another note, I believe the idea of a grinder build is to be self sufficient so the idea of bringing a primary that relies on ammo bags sort of ruins the whole concept IMO."
paydaytheheist,3dxdea,RandomKennyRevived,7,Mon Jul 20 09:37:13 2015 UTC,He's using LBV without crook or sneaky bastard so his dodge while crouching even with Duck and cover would still be a minus number.
paydaytheheist,3dxdea,thesatsuma,3,Mon Jul 20 10:06:31 2015 UTC,"The main point of this build was originally for me to find a way to pair the Flamethrower with the Grinder deck, it seems like they were made for each other. I very rarely see people using the Flamethrower, so I assume it's not liked very much. With this build I was able to make it viable for DW. If you use it right you shouldn't have to refill your ammo very often.  Edit: This build is not designed for dodge, but you're right about it being able to use more armor."
paydaytheheist,3dxdea,thepedge,3,Mon Jul 20 10:21:59 2015 UTC,"/r/paydaybuilds   Although I don't think Grinder is worth it with LBV, I'd much rather have dodge chance like my build.  I did try doing a TechForcer with Grinder and LBV but all it really does is allow you to take 1 more shot on DW, I think it's far more valuable to have the chance for a few shots to miss and having more speed."
paydaytheheist,3dxdea,DyLaNzZpRo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:35:44 2015 UTC,"Joker is practically pointless, drill upgrade skills are mediocre, and going into another tree just for additional ammo capacity and ammobags is well, not that great."

All the skills I chose in the Enforcer tree have their uses too, it's not just buildup for the ammo."
paydaytheheist,3dxdea,Fault-ee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:29:34 2015 UTC,"Eeeh, there's a few other skills you could've gotten instead, as well, joker is practically useless. Not only that, do you really need to get ammobags? I mean shit, you could've gotten something far more useful rather than just ammo with a few filler skills, it's not that the skills are ""bad"", it's just that they're not great, the only real ""useful"" skills are stun resistance and transporter, but you kinda went up that tree just for ammobags as well as ammo capacity, which I somewhat think is pointless."

paydaytheheist,3dxdea,SavvySillybug,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:38 2015 UTC,"On Overkill and below the difference between Suit and LBV is negligible because you'll be tanking with your health anyways.   But on Death Wish the 25-35% dodge is far far more useful than an extra 30 armor (which is enough maybe a single extra shot from an Elite/Tan at 20-30m away). In close quarters, Elites will one-shot your armor regardless."

Golden grin is pretty good except for that part of it, moving 30 bags through the same route is boring as hell.  I think they had the balance right in the early heists.  Framing frame: 4-9 paintings, 8 coke, 6 gold Rats: 7 meth, 11 cash/meth, 12-14 moneybags Firestarter: 8-12 weapons Watchdogs: 12 coke      Then shadow raid and big bank came and had twice as many and they seem to like that trend, I personally don't enjoy it.

Just look at Tabula Rasa, where you use NO skills. Also, when you go infamous there is no level requirement for DW so you can just host DW from the start, which is also a good way to get XP. DW Jewellery Store can easily get you up to around level 30.  The only reason I would see to have this restriction would be for non-infamous players, and even then, most players I know are smart enough not to make stupid mistakes.

I am just trying to stop pub new players from joining missions which are too hard for them and just becoming a nuisance. Also after DW I read on the Wiki that you have to be level 40 start it and 80 if non-infamous.
paydaytheheist,3dxnpg,MeltingTerminal,4,Mon Jul 20 12:18:27 2015 UTC,"Well the wiki is wrong then, I've hosted DW games at level 0 every infamy so far, including yesterday. It doesn't surprise me too much, the wiki is wrong about a lot of things."
paydaytheheist,3dxnpg,B11267,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:21:32 2015 UTC,Well.. Once I go Infamous again I'll just farm DW Jewellery 'til level 40-50.
paydaytheheist,3dxnpg,MeltingTerminal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:29:03 2015 UTC,"The wiki is half right. It's wrong in terms of level 40 post infamy (presumably changed with 2.0), but it is correct in terms of being level 80 non-infamous."
paydaytheheist,3dxnpg,B11267,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:34:00 2015 UTC,"It definitely wasn't changed with 2.0. It must have been a change they made sometime closer to the release of DW, because it's definitely been in the game since update 40, but I can't say anything about before that."
paydaytheheist,3dxnpg,colin969,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:07:13 2015 UTC,A mystery for the ages.
paydaytheheist,3dxnpg,SavvySillybug,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:57:27 2015 UTC,"Difficulty level restrictions after 0-80 are on a per heist basis. The starter heists you can immediately host DW lobbies, but you should find that you can't even host some of the Pro jobs etc past hard until you've levelled a little."
paydaytheheist,3dxnpg,nihilus666,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:56:48 2015 UTC,"Ukrainian Job actually gets you a little bit more XP because it's a pro job, even though it has an XP malus for being restricted to level 11+. And I find it easier to do with 0 skills. Go in through the back, kill a few guards, put the drill, the rest of the guards come in to check and you kill them one by one as they're lured to you, and then you just make sure the back doesn't cause a clusterfluffle.  You can get in and out without the front ever noticing you were there, and that stops you from causing a huge chain reaction like you possibly couldn't prevent without ECMs.  But, yes. The rest of the post makes sense, I just wanted to share this."
paydaytheheist,3dxnpg,SavvySillybug,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:02:04 2015 UTC,Diamond Store and Art Gallery are even better exp per minute since there's no titan safe to drill. Vastly so if you have friends to ecm rush them for you.
paydaytheheist,3dxnpg,EvadableMoxie,2,Tue Jul 21 02:08:29 2015 UTC,It's less about exp per minute and more about the most XP you can easily get in a single heist so you get some points to put into stuff. Once you hit level ~30 with a single heist the rest is kinda easy.
paydaytheheist,3dxnpg,EvadableMoxie,2,Tue Jul 21 02:09:43 2015 UTC,"I don't see the point of level requirement enforced by the game at all.  If a level 12 wants to host a DW contract, let him.  People can decide to join or not and he's making the decision for himself.  If you are hosting, you can set whatever rep level you want for whatever difficulty you want, so if you want a level 80 minimum for VH, you can do that.  I don't see the point in having the game for abritrarly restraints.  It should be up to the host to decide what they want to host, and then who gets in."
paydaytheheist,3dxnpg,EvadableMoxie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:55:43 2015 UTC,The issue I see is that lower levels do not fully understand the difficulty levels. If they did I doubt they would be in DW.

paydaytheheist,3dxnpg,samcuu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:23:01 2015 UTC,They shouldn't have to do that though as it will ruin it for anyone who was actually trying do the mission as he/she takes up a slot in the crew. With friends it most things can be done on DW as a three but with pubs it is already a challenge. Ignoring this I do think there should be a deeper tutorial behind the difficulties either way.

Either way, not a big deal."
