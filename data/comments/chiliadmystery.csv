chiliadmystery,3e08c8,dwlater,2,Mon Jul 20 23:21:07 2015 UTC,"Good post! For those who were in the other threads where people (including me) were a little miffed, this is the type of content we like to see in a brand new thread. Even if certain pieces have been posted/considered before, in a context like this it's something that makes a hunter's face light up with a smile.     Are the IRL images ones you found? Or did you actually make a field trip to take some pictures? If so, Kifflom! ;) Well, it applies either way because the album is interesting in and of itself.     Something I didn't know before this post was that the front doors are modeled differently for the left half where the panels light up at night. It's always bugged me to call this a bug (heh), but with the doors specifically modeled that way, it makes me question whether or not that's the case. Why model it in this particular way and go out of your way to incorporate the poly's that they did, when simply mirroring the right half would be infinitely easier and not result in this?     I've noted in a few other similar threads: There's only one symbol on the in-game door that is similar to another symbol. Look at the symbol in the upper Right-hand corner. The one that looks like a * with a hole in the middle. The other instance of it has 3 horizontal curved lines.     It was probably said over the year, but I never realized that the obelisk has an actual star at the base. Curioser and curioser..."
chiliadmystery,3e08c8,DreamingDjinn,3,Tue Jul 21 01:16:59 2015 UTC,IRL there is a tunnel entrance to the Observatory on Mount Hollywood Drive.
chiliadmystery,3e08c8,Chilltyperiod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:21:12 2015 UTC,What I don't get is why they chose to put lights in two doors. Its a departure from real life on something that they copied down to the minute detail.
chiliadmystery,3e08c8,serovajoe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:35:51 2015 UTC,I still haven't seen any lights on pictures of the IRL doors.  Do you a link?
chiliadmystery,3e08c8,arist0t13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:07:39 2015 UTC,so I know this has already been discussed heavily but why did we dismiss the crack in the observatory dome again? i remember reading those threads a long time ago and people just said something like....thats just the way they built that part of the game? or something? does it not look like to you guys that that whole section can be blown up and removed? why would they design the dome like that
chiliadmystery,3e08c8,Powermatjes,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:29:14 2015 UTC,"Lots of interesting things being said about the observatory doors lately, so I've uploaded my entire folder of observatory images. Please check your ""facts"" against these images.  Of special note is the first image, from the game files - it seems to indicate there will only ever be 2 lights on, unless the others are created in a completely different way. Which is not impossible, I suppose.  Also, I've never seen lights on the real-life ones, despite what people are saying.  Links, anyone?  Finally, anyone notice the odd maze-ish design under the ""Not an Entrance"" sign?  I hope this helps someone."

So we also have a mural with 3 Symbols, which fits perfectly with these 3 sections of the observatory.  EDIT: So UFO - Planetarium, Egg - Hall of Science, Jetpack (or maybe something different?) - Laserium."

You're not the Mods. If it was a pointless post downvote or report it. Don't be fucking assholes because someone wants to join the search. Fuck, for people who grasp at straws and literally always circle jerks you are all quite full of yourselves.   Anyways. Sorry op but I haven't seen the real life comparison of the observatory doors so I cannot say I know of why or what is different but if it is something that is clearly out of place, then I say it definitely deserves some attention. I have seen mention in this thread of a glitch where 2 signs that say not an entrance light up at night so maybe its just something small that we missed and are now assuming is a glitch. I'll look up the real life doors and lights and compare to the in game doors and lights and try a few things with each character. I'm at 100% no cheats on xbox 360. I'll update if I notice anything.   Thanks for posting."
chiliadmystery,3dyuea,Steezymann,2,Mon Jul 20 19:38:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, I was curious because I was researching the real life version and I saw only 2 ""Not an entrance"" signs on the real one (I'm assuming they are lights just like the GTA one) and I was thinking, everyone says they are ""the exact same"" but why are there 2 lights on one but 4 lights on the other?

I appreciate these posts because when I get off work and I sign on, there is hopefully something to test. Stuff like this gives us active hunters something new.

I thought it was strange and for some reason it made people angry. I'm on here all the time and never post and I've never seen someone mention this so I figured I'd see if anyone noticed.

chiliadmystery,3dyuea,mindm4ster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:24:19 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, it's not an entrance until all the lights are on. Obviously when there are no lights, they all say ""Not an Entrance"". Does that mean when we active all 4 lights, it will become enterable? Since all 4 ""Not An Entrance"" signs would be gone at that point? I don't know how to active the lights, or if it's even possible, but that's my view. I don't follow this much anymore because there's nothing new, but my guess is that the UFO/Jetpack/Egg would be in the observatory due to the 3 big domes. And the eye out front. If they aren't at the observatory, they don't exist at all in my eyes."
chiliadmystery,3dyuea,Steezymann,-8,Mon Jul 20 22:34:11 2015 UTC,why the hell even people linked those doors to mystery in the first place ?Just because of spider-web shape?Ridiculous
chiliadmystery,3dyuea,mindm4ster,2,Mon Jul 20 17:33:03 2015 UTC,"Because they found random spider webs that only appear at certain times, one of them being right next to the mural? So when someone saw there was a spider web on the door that looks fairly similar to these odd spider webs that appear at certain times it appeared to many that we had over looked at least one thing. Now, if the webs have anything to do with the doors or the mystery is still up in the air. Buuuut regardless, its worth looking into. Now take your Debbie Downer ass somewhere else or if you decide to stay here, maybe learn a little about what is currently going on before you criticize someone for trying to continue a discussion about the sole subject of this subreddit; solving or debunking the mystery."

I don't think anyone has said that they saw this sign long ago; it's why I posted it. I'm normally pretty attentive to the ads in GTA, both to enjoy all the humor in them and to look out for hints related to the mystery, and have never seen this one. I don't see why communication through the billboards is so farfetched to you. Do the seemingly random arrows on big hotel signs not point us to the UFO?"
chiliadmystery,3dsyo9,dopestep,11,Sun Jul 19 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"I saw this billboard almost two years ago when this game came out on last gen. It's a bank joke, that's it."

chiliadmystery,3dsyo9,rizzlybear,27,Tue Jul 21 18:28:32 2015 UTC,Could this just be telling us to invest in stocks when they're down to make money?

chiliadmystery,3dsyo9,GameDevC,4,Sun Jul 19 08:07:05 2015 UTC,Then maybe your character needs to have spent all their money to activate whatever needs to be done. Think about the Chiliad UFO. You need 100% to see it and on the way to 100% you accumulate a shit ton of money. So maybe you have to spend it all?
chiliadmystery,3dsyo9,WarBob,-6,Sun Jul 19 08:04:14 2015 UTC,So a bank with a billboard joking about getting into debt is encouraging us to spend our money for the mystery?  Based on what? Where is the logical connection between the mystery and the bank's billboard.
chiliadmystery,3dsyo9,GameDevC,5,Sun Jul 19 08:10:39 2015 UTC,I didn't post the billboard I'm just spit balling ideas. No need to be angry.

chiliadmystery,3dsyo9,GameDevC,2,Sun Jul 19 08:24:15 2015 UTC,"I just meant you were very aggressive in your reply. I can see how it's a flawed idea but in the context of this post I'm trying to see if there could be some relevance to the amount of money you have. Think about how the UFO unlocks. It is due to a list of variables being set at a required value. Weather, Time, Location and Completion. What if they are not the only variables? Maybe money is one of them."

Something solid should direct us towards doing something rather than random ideas."
chiliadmystery,3dsyo9,Zoelacks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:42:31 2015 UTC,"Oh you are so wrong about that, dont you know how past EASTER EGGS or mysterys at all worked? There WAS NEVER any hint or sign wich says ""HEY, im the first step, BLOW THESE WALLS and you will find a secret room behind""!   Everything was found completly random, just like the UFO´s in Gta5, people didnt just see the glyphs first and where like ""OH  , this glyph says rain and there are 3 stripes so it must be 3am"" NO they just fly around at 100% and found it randomly.   You argue with logic but Easter eggs or mysterys in videogames never had anything to do with logic or sense. Its the most random things that happen in video games, you see something ODD and think hey maybe blow this up and TADA hey heres a secret room!   But i agree on this specific statement about the post from that other guy, it really doesnt make any sense to connect that mb road sign with the mystery at all since it really is just a joke by R*."
chiliadmystery,3dsyo9,WarBob,-4,Sun Jul 19 16:43:23 2015 UTC,"I agree. Easter eggs in videogames for the most part tend to be completely random and purely about trying to hide them in clever ways.  This doesn't apply to the mystery however. While the UFOs and glyphs were found randomly they were still placed with the intention of being found in a specific way.  The glyphs are supposed to direct to the conditions required to have the UFO appear.  While you are correct in many easter eggs being based on random luck, the content we have found thus far implies it was intended to be found in a specific order and manner. And what we have found thus far has had a series of logical stepping stones dictating where to go next.  Long story short; there's a difference between the definition of an ""easter egg"" and an ""easter egg hunt""."
chiliadmystery,3dsyo9,Ungreth,2,Mon Jul 20 12:24:58 2015 UTC,"That didn't sound aggressive to me. He didn't mock, belittle or insult you in any way. He was simply asking you to expand on your reasoning of how spending all your money might connect to the mystery. Surely you can see that if an idea doesn't stand up to being challenged then it's not an idea that carries much weight. I think any time you make an assertion about anything in life, you should expect somebody to say ""how and why?"" and be prepared to defend your assertion."

chiliadmystery,3dsyo9,kultrazero,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:38:43 2015 UTC,"1) Somebody posted a while ago saying that the maze bank building glows with a green swirling mist if you view it from Mt Chiliad while the UFO is visible. No idea if it was confirmed or not, but that's what the thread was about.  2) It has also been said that interiors load at the maze bank building when the UFO appears.   If either of those things above are true, then the connection is pretty direct.  Another thing that connects it to the mystery for me is the use of that shade of red. They use colors in a strange way in this game, the red/blue duality, the colors of the character's icons, Epsilon blue, etc. I feel like it would take like nine posts that everybody would hate to fully explore what all the colors are being used for, but this red makes me think of the x's on the mural and eye glyph on top of the mountain.   And it makes me think of the choice between red and blue, siding with criminals over cops, etc. it's definitely a banking joke, but it could also be a reference to karma theory as well.  EDIT: the mystery can be seen in almost every single aspect of GTA V, from beginning to end. Maybe trying to find the two or three things in the game that don't relate to it would get us some results, lol."

You have to keep checking it after you invest though because once it starts going back down it will stay down. I found this significant because all the other investments I have made (not too many, just randomly chosen) never go positive.

Not to mention his special ability is to basically get really angry (Seeing Red) and he kind of represents fire as a character, absolutely destructive with a quick temper and a penchant for taking advantage of others."
chiliadmystery,3dsyo9,Beyond_Insemination,2,Sun Jul 19 23:03:45 2015 UTC,I think his hair color might even be considered red/red brown   http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20141122221801/gtawiki/images/d/dd/TrevorPhilips-GTAV-next.jpg of course...black is the new red
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Jakeab89,6,Sun Jul 19 12:35:32 2015 UTC,"I know some folk think the Altruist camp shadow is Jesus toast and maybe it is, maybe it isn't...but the worst explanation I've heard of the jetpack symbol on the mural is the one that goes something like this >  ""The jetpack in San Andreas was found at an army base, so the jetpack symbol is saying to go to the army base where we will find a ufo""  That's just plain lazy. It's illogical, tangential thinking. Also it's been repeated by so many different people who all try to claim they came up with that lame ol' brain-fart of a theory all on their little ownsome, when it's actually the oldest and most unoriginal explanation given for the jetpack symbol since this mystery began.  Dang, it makes me mad I tells ya!"
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Ungreth,4,Sun Jul 19 15:32:29 2015 UTC,"The worst part is this is basically the ""official"" interpretation. If you looked up the easter eggs for the game, this is what you would be told, and most people just accepted that. Zancudo doesn't even resemble Area 69 at all. This is the only other ""logical"" possibility I have seen on this sub, otherwise it has to be a jetpack. and why the fuck would they put a picture of a jetpack in the game and not a real jetpack? This is my favorite game but god damnit do I hate Rockstar"
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,bluntsarebest,2,Sun Jul 19 16:06:24 2015 UTC,The prison resembles area 69 a lot more since it was 20 years ago it's possible they converted it at some point after Zancudo was built
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,themasterofmystery,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:05:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, thank you! This is what I think as well! Same basic shape and location as San Andreas. Plus, what kind of prison has SAMs?"
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,bluntsarebest,2,Mon Jul 20 03:29:55 2015 UTC,I made that point the other day but people wrote it off because of the different universes.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,themasterofmystery,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:09:22 2015 UTC,The different universe concept isn't exactly full proof. There's many references to pervious characters which their back story never changed.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,TheNoXiousTurtle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:12:09 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought, and let's not forget it's a video game."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,AnEvilVet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:13:43 2015 UTC,"You know, the prison's locations in GTA 5 is very close to Area 69 in GTA:SA. At least that's what I remember. In GTA:SA Area 69 was pretty close to some construction sites... and the prison, yep."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Ungreth,-2,Tue Jul 21 13:11:33 2015 UTC,The majority of the easter eggs in GTA V are based on the myths from GTA SA. Why is it an issue that the jetpack symbol also references GTA SA?
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,AnEvilVet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:35:04 2015 UTC,"Because that would make no sense unless the mural itself is an easter egg referencing GTA SA. And besides, if I were to follow your logic then I would have to point out that all the other SA myths have been made ""real"" in this game. Bigfoot, the ghost, the ufo, the serial killer...you can find them all. So where's the jetpack?"
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Ungreth,-4,Sun Jul 19 18:49:05 2015 UTC,"The mural is referencing GTA SA because the UFOs are a myth from that game.  The jetpack was actually in GTA SA, the other stuff wasn't.  That's why the jetpack isn't actually in GTA V, it's a myth."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Supakim1,2,Sun Jul 19 19:19:25 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're right and R* have deliberately deceived us by misdirection just to lead us on an unending wild goose chase, I say this to R*...you're even bigger assholes than the Dark Souls director who pulled the same shitty stunt on players with the ""mysterious"" pendant.  A shitty stunt  Let's hope you're wrong."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Supakim1,0,Sun Jul 19 20:13:25 2015 UTC,Tell me why you think the jetpcak is the end reward for solving the mystery? give one reason
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Supakim1,2,Mon Jul 20 01:24:31 2015 UTC,"Because there's one on the mural, or are you gonna try telling me that it's scuba Steve?"
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,tryfuhl,0,Mon Jul 20 10:13:13 2015 UTC,"no, it's a jetpack stickman.. BUT it's in the bottom corner of the mural and it's a perfect hint towards the millitary base.. it's not a reward"
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Ungreth,2,Mon Jul 20 10:55:01 2015 UTC,How is it the perfect hint towards the military base? Wouldn't they have used a jet or a tank instead of enticing us with a picture of a jetpack man?
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Supakim1,2,Mon Jul 20 11:35:15 2015 UTC,"Because of GTA:SA it should have been the first thing to think of when you see a jetpack? So why use a jet or a tank when they can use a jetpack and maybe cause a huge mystery hunt for it, and they did GOOD"
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,GiantSquidd,2,Mon Jul 20 12:24:51 2015 UTC,I mean did they really not think we'd find the military installation without that jetpack symbol? I found the base way before I found the mural.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Supakim1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:41:30 2015 UTC,"Yup, and there would be much better ways to point us towards a military air base anyway, such as a jet fighter symbol for example."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,XxSCRAPOxX,0,Sun Jul 19 18:56:43 2015 UTC,"Do you have ANY better explaination for the jetpack stickman ?  don't tell me you think you will get a jetpack as an reward for solving the mystery ? if you think so, please tell me why? NOTHING is pointing towards a jetpack being in the game.. if you ask me, the jetpack is the oldest bullshit theory made.."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,bluntsarebest,2,Mon Jul 20 01:06:43 2015 UTC,"The mural has a jetpack guy in a box on the mural that's opposite the ufo image, which is a reward of sorts for reaching 100%.  Do you really think there was a jetpack in another game's military base which was very different in about every way one military base can differ from another, so this jetpack guy suggests checking there is a better explanation?  Are you seriously trying to say you or anyone else playing this game wouldn't check the military base for mystery related stuff without having played gtasa and seen the mural?"
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,XxSCRAPOxX,-2,Mon Jul 20 03:10:04 2015 UTC,"ofc we would check the millitary base for clues, but if you look at the mural as a ufo MAP it's a perfect hint towards the millitary base.. yes they are very different, the only thing is that none of them shows up on the map. The ufo on the mural is a hint towards the hippe-camp and over there you also find a ufo.. the mural is a f**** ufo MAP...  you telling me you bevlive there is a jetpack reward ?"
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,bluntsarebest,-1,Mon Jul 20 11:01:49 2015 UTC,Notice how people get angry when writing off rewards as they can't explain their reasons for there not being one.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,XxSCRAPOxX,2,Mon Jul 20 10:14:36 2015 UTC,It's the most simple explanation and easy to find on ones own.   It definitely meets Occam's razor. Unless you have a better theory than idk bud. I haven't heard one.   As for the lines? I think they just mean you have to travel.   R* Didn't make this game complicated or deep. They made it extremely simple and basic. I doubt the mystery is as deep as we think it is here.   I'll eat my words if someone finds that damn ufo or jet pack though.  But after three years of tens of thousands of hunters and hackers and still nothing? I think the simplest theory is the most correct at this point.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,bluntsarebest,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:25:03 2015 UTC,Actually it doesn't meet occam's razor at all. this explanation of the jetpack symbol makes the most and biggest assumptions. Rockstar actually made this game extremely complicated and deep. It took over 1000 people (a chiliad) and 200 million dollars to make this game. Its not simple or basic. As for thousands of hunters? This sub is proof that most people are like you and actually don't hunt for more than what they found on ign or the gtawiki. most people don't even get 100% to see the UFO for themselves. If Rockstar WANTED to (which is the assumption we are making) they had the resources to create the best easter egg in video game history and hide it better than anyone could imagine.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,XxSCRAPOxX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:04:46 2015 UTC,"IF R* wanted to. Which I don't honk they did. And by not complicated. I mean the game itself requires 0 problem solving abilities. The only puzzle in the game is the mural. It also doesn't require and real gamer skills to 100% it. Every part of the game is easy and every mission is linear. They mystery, if there even is one, was likely handled the same as the rest of the game. They gave us a few clues, we found some aliens, we probably could have found them without the clues, but whatever, it's rockstar, their stories are funny, but not very deep or involved. Never have been.   Also even the hackers have nothing. You almost have to be insane to think there's any thing more. But I guess that's the beauty of the mystery. It's only for the believers.   Also your assumption about me is incorrect. As it probably is about the rest of us. I still hunt daily, I don't use guids because no one has cracked it supposedly so no guide is correct if there's something more to it. Which there probably isn't. Rockstar is way more likely to troll us than to create the worlds greatest  riddle.   Throwing an edit in: what really bugs me though, is say like call of duty zombies for example, it's a complicated Easter egg, it requires four skilled players working as a team to complete 12-20 difficult steps with weapons or contraptions no one would have likely used at random and we have no problem busting those wide open hours after the game launches.   This one is years in and no one has one single theory that even begins to point in the right direction. Something's amiss. It shouldn't be this hard."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,XxSCRAPOxX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:12:36 2015 UTC,"Again, I disagree with you. If you try to get gold on all the missions they are not easy. There are several missions that actually give you choices, whether good or bad, they change the entire game; the story is not linear. The community actually did find all the UFOs in the game without the mural, all of those easter eggs were found days before or hours after the official release of the game. We have only found 1 alien. And youre right, it is Rockstar, but their jokes are actually extremely involved: Lazlow makes references to GTA 3, as well as the Epsilon program being around since San Andreas and having members in real life and in the game. The hackers have uncovered a lot of things that have kept this mystery going like the alien egg, jetpack files and other mysterious strings that have been hidden or removed during patches. I don't believe you when you say you hunt daily, because you don't even believe there is a mystery. You used the call of duty example but a better example is shadow of the colossus. We're hunting because we believe there is more."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Ungreth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:23:46 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge shadow of the colossus fan. I wasted a lot of time on that game as well. It's actually what got me into this chiliad thing. Reminiscent of the hunt from then.   I want to believe so bad haha. It's actually sotc that's discouraging me. There was nothing but half finished files that never made it to game. I enjoy the mystery of it all, I don't really care if there's a reward or not. A jet pack/ufo whatever will get boring after ~20 mins in it anyway. It's really all about the mystery, and I guess you're right, some parts are pretty deep ingame and the story is a bit involved, and this time around it's not linear. The previous ones were, this ones missions are kind of straight forward, but you're right, there's decision that change the outcome this time around, so that's a mechanic that I'm going to start looking at more.  Also, in very curious about these files you say were found for the egg and jet pack? I haven't heard about this and google turned up nothing solid for me accept some old reddit threads that seemed to be debunked. any links?"
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,bluntsarebest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:02:33 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend this entire post. It's long, but in my opinion a perfect summary of the chiliad mystery. This is the only explanation of the mural that is backed by real, in-game evidence, and its a concept thats never really discussed on this sub. Many people disregard what they think are ""tinfoil hat"" theories because they just sound too crazy to be true. This post really puts you in the mindset of Rockstar, and shows how they can simultaneously lead the egg hunters on a wild goose chase AND provide small rewards along the way for the truly dedicated. This hunt isn't necessarily for anything specific because we don't know what to expect; you can believe in the mystery AND not believe there is a jetpack or flyable ufo. Unfortunately, the comparison to SOTC brings up the harsh reality that everything we think are clues could just be cut content, or placeholders for future DLC. The point of the mural all along could have just been a clue about the sequel where you fight aliens while riding a dinosaur to steal the jetpack which is being built by the lizard people. Who knows, Rockstar ain't sayin shit.  I would check out this  section of the wiki listing all of the mysterious game files that have been found."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Chronichaze92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:35:04 2015 UTC,Three years? The game hasn't even been out for two years and I think R* have made it pretty obvious that they've gone into fine detail with things in the game.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,gazzy82,0,Mon Jul 20 22:31:05 2015 UTC,"Ok, then two years. It's still really long.  I will say though, no one has made heads or tails of those ciphers at the hippy camp. Those have always stood out to me."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Supakim1,3,Mon Jul 20 22:33:55 2015 UTC,Yeah the hippy camp is another place that's never been fully debunked.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Chronichaze92,3,Mon Jul 20 22:38:42 2015 UTC,"Nor has the fort or bunker. It's frustrating at this point without any further clues.   Don't get me wrong, I'm a believer. It's just the most logical theory at this point seems to me that it was just the ufos. But here's to hunting!"
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,gazzy82,4,Mon Jul 20 22:56:59 2015 UTC,"Yep....you're so right. Nobody claiming the mystery to be ""solved"" has ever provided a solid explanation of the lines on the mural. Why exactly do the lines twist and turn and interconnect with each other in such a way? This is the question that's been bugging me since the very first time I set eyes on that damned mural. To me, this remains the one unsolved aspect of the mystery that warrants more discussion than anything else raised recently on this sub.  It's simultaneously like a maze, an aerial street view, a logic gate circuit board and a cross section of subterranean catacombs. The closest things I've seen in the game are the red lines on the Maze Bank's fountain and the cover of the book Hacking The System."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Chronichaze92,2,Sun Jul 19 14:10:00 2015 UTC,There's also the maze at the Kortz buildings.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,gazzy82,0,Sun Jul 19 14:14:24 2015 UTC,and the background of the textile city mural
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Supakim1,2,Sun Jul 19 16:08:58 2015 UTC,"If it's solved why do people still go on this sub, in the back of their mind they know it's not."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Chronichaze92,0,Sun Jul 19 12:51:25 2015 UTC,i think it's solved. I come back because part of me wants more. more than the shitty FIB aircraft after 100%.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,gazzy82,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:46:44 2015 UTC,I believe there may be more to the mystery but there is no jetpack as a lot of people think this mystery is all about..
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Chronichaze92,2,Mon Jul 20 16:24:49 2015 UTC,"Then explain the Jetpack strings found in the code, also someone made a scuba suit fly able which shows the physics of the Jetpack are there..."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,gazzy82,0,Mon Jul 20 17:07:13 2015 UTC,Did they though? I wouldn't know code if it bit my arse and licked my ball sack to be honest. Would you know the difference between actual code and made up code from a screen grab?
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,DC_Millions,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:11:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know code at all but it's in the wiki, personally I think it was r* messing with us but they watch this sub and know we want a Jetpack. For me I don't care about the Jetpack but want secret missions, I don't believe r* would fuck us around but you gotta remember this is a huge mystery what won't be solved until the next gta or maybe never."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Sneaky-walrus,4,Mon Jul 20 17:17:40 2015 UTC,Yeah you could be right. Gotta say i've pretty much lost the faith at this point. I'd love some more missions or even something to do after completion ;/
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,GTAV_mystery,-2,Mon Jul 20 17:25:31 2015 UTC,Are you talking about mods? that has nothing to do with the physics in the game..

chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Ungreth,-1,Sun Jul 19 14:06:08 2015 UTC,The shadow on the stone is Jesus toast at best.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,KillaPam,2,Sun Jul 19 14:47:44 2015 UTC,"I disagree, a shadow perfectly shaped as the Jetpack on the mural which appears at 3.00 same as other mystery related stuff."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,DopeBoy187,0,Sun Jul 19 15:55:06 2015 UTC,I'll go take a look for myself. Any weather?
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,AnEvilVet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:41:26 2015 UTC,I will say the jetpack shadow is one of the few things in the game you really have to see for yourself. Pictures never do it justice. It's worth a look in person fersure.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,KillaPam,2,Mon Jul 20 06:49:49 2015 UTC,"Yep, go there and have a long look and tell me it's not ridiculously similar to the mural."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,AnEvilVet,-1,Mon Jul 20 10:17:48 2015 UTC,"Good point. Any theories on why the ""map"" goes in the way it does? It doesn't actually map out on the map, and there are dead ends. I've heard people say it represents the course of the story. Buuuuut it could also not."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,AnEvilVet,0,Sun Jul 19 12:43:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah you look at it and it does seem like decisions you have to make but that's where it's so clever, as it could mean so many different things."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,KillaPam,0,Sun Jul 19 14:05:58 2015 UTC,"We also have the minute clock egg in Paleto Bay. That gotta mean something, right?"
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,AnEvilVet,0,Mon Jul 20 02:04:53 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of egg shaped things around Paleto, they could all be relevant."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,AnEvilVet,0,Mon Jul 20 11:51:33 2015 UTC,for people who already think the mystery is solved and just come here everyday and post comments like 'omg this is such jesus toast' 'omg it's just a shadow' please just fuck off and don't come back thanks
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,KillaPam,2,Sun Jul 19 21:52:19 2015 UTC,Especially when R* themselves said they put a lot of thought into the smallest of details.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,AnEvilVet,-1,Sun Jul 19 22:52:33 2015 UTC,Also the Alien Egg found in the files is clearly the Egg on the Mural.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,LaFlame300,-3,Sun Jul 19 14:43:25 2015 UTC,"Yup, I reckon you're probably right and that egg is still out there somewhere waiting to be found."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,AnEvilVet,2,Sun Jul 19 15:34:06 2015 UTC,My guess is it's underwater in the area of Zancudo. Have you seen those underwater rocks that look just like the Egg? I doubt the artists would make them so close in resemblance for aesthetic purposes.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,KillaPam,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:19:07 2015 UTC,Probably would have been found.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,AnEvilVet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:42:50 2015 UTC,These 'rocks' are giant clams.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,KillaPam,0,Sun Jul 19 18:36:46 2015 UTC,You do not know what I'm talking about. Obviously I can determine what is and what isn't a clam shell included in the game. I've gone diving in tropical waters several times I know what I'm talking about don't worry.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,AnEvilVet,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:25:13 2015 UTC,They do look very egg-like.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,KillaPam,-1,Mon Jul 20 11:52:42 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're on about something other than these things I'd be interested in hearing more as this is the first I've heard of them.  Do you have a picture of what you're on about then?  It isn't obvious that you can determine what is and isn't a clam shell.  I have no way of knowing your clam shell knowledge and a number of people have confused the things in the image I linked too with eggs.  I'm not worried about what you're talking about as your level of scuba diving in the past is, in the nicest possible way, not too relevant seeing as this is a videogame and not real life.  I mean, I've walked in America before but it doesn't mean I could easily identify a Blood or a Crip despite the equivalents appearing in GTA V."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,KillaPam,0,Mon Jul 20 13:00:39 2015 UTC,"Someone made a post about them recently but it got removed, they look like egg shaped rocks pushed into the seabed."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,AnEvilVet,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:19:49 2015 UTC,Oh I see.  Could they be coral possibly?  There's some beautiful spherical corals out there
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,KillaPam,2,Mon Jul 20 14:30:42 2015 UTC,Did you not read my comment? I clearly stated I was not talking about those giant clams. Wow.   Seeing something in real life is not the same as seeing it in a video game?? Hahahaha that's hilarious so the ocean that they modeled after real life doesn't include animals and foliage that exists in real life? Foliage that I clearly have seen whilst diving?
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,AnEvilVet,4,Mon Jul 20 13:38:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, I did read it, which is why I asked for clarification of what egg shaped objects you meant and offered an image of an object that people commonly mistake for an egg of some kind.  I even asked for a picture of what you meant so I could learn more, which should be enough to say to you that I'm interested in learning from you.  As I mentioned in my previous post, your experience scuba diving, whilst fun and I'm envious that you've done it, doesn't correlate exactly to a completely fictional and virtual underwater environment in a video game.  The environment they created for this game isn't an exact copy of where you scuba dived seeing as it's completely fictional so the things they modelled them over may be different species of whatever you believe them to be.  You also seem to believe I was with you on your trip or something?  I'm not sure how you'd expect me to know what real life foliage you've seen whilst diving?  Also, I'll ask one more time to please tone down the hostility you seem to be expressing to me. I am genuinely interested in what you have to say and I want to learn by asking questions, I'm not criticising your personal belief system or anything like that (or certainly not intending to), I just learn by questioning, like most people.  So please tone it down."
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,moistboyz,3,Mon Jul 20 14:17:55 2015 UTC,Except it's untextured and doesn't have a crack in it.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,AnEvilVet,-4,Sun Jul 19 18:36:25 2015 UTC,Why does it have to have a crack???? Do any of the UFOs look exactly like the one depicted on the Mural??? Really just think.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Zoelacks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:24:18 2015 UTC,Well if it was clearly the egg from the mural it would look exactly like it wouldn't it? What do you feel the crack signifies then? The UFO looks just like the one on the car at the hippy camp after all.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,dwlater,0,Mon Jul 20 05:33:03 2015 UTC,I think the crack is just there as a hint to let us know its an egg as eggs crack because if It was just the oval shape it would be too vague and the mural is already vague enough.
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,moistboyz,0,Mon Jul 20 06:23:23 2015 UTC,That's a good point but Paleto Bay has lots of egg symbols that don't have cracks in them and they look like eggs.

chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,SuperMaruoBrassiere,0,Mon Jul 20 13:37:36 2015 UTC,"My point is that an egg symbol doesn't necessarily need a crack on it to denote that it symbolises an egg, the egg symbols in Paleto Bay are proof of that."

Why is it hard to understand the correlation between the two? Why is it hard to see the Alien Egg as related to the Mural?   There is no explanation it just is what it is. It's not like the Alien Egg and the Egg on the Mural are two different objects. They are both Eggs. One of them is named Egg in the files, alieneggprop or something like that, maybe it doesn't say egg in the files but regardless it is an egg. The Egg on the Mural is an egg.   If I was comparing the shape of a house to the Alien Egg it wouldn't make sense but the shape on the Mural is clearly an Egg."

chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,DopeBoy187,0,Mon Jul 20 22:51:14 2015 UTC,"I agree for the most part...I do think though, that the under the platform eye on Chiliad is oriented to tell us which direction to head/fall to start seeing some glyphs.    Orange ball, I don't think are much.  Have you ever jacked a Semi with a trailer, driven for awhile, looked behind you and the trailer is just gone....or better yet replaced with a totally different trailer?  I think this happens very often and is in lines with the despawn of balls.  When you are driving in an area have you ever heard the high pitched squelching ...not the cell phone noises or what happens in tunnels or anything on the radio...this is almost as if the game is entering or leaving specific event areas.  So, say if the game is in a big grid like the map that comes with it...everytime to leave a square, there is this odd noise.  I wonder if that is why the balls go away?  It would be very interesting to see on ps4 or pc, just how far these orange balls can be away from their spawn area.  I did laugh at how you ended your comments...1111one   lol!"
chiliadmystery,3dtwb2,Beyond_Insemination,2,Sun Jul 19 18:07:54 2015 UTC,"Hey man!   Yes, that thing with the trailer is really weird, and its something that happens with alot of stuff in the game.    Remember, the spiderweb wich was recently found is there as long as you want if you keep looking at it /focus the ingame camera on it, if you look away for 1 milisecond and look back it dissapears (ofc after 3:00)  And pls correct me if im wrong, but I think same goes for the chiliad Ufo, it stays there as long as you look at it, but if you move ur camera around and back to the UFO its not there anymore.    Seriously, theres so many weird things in this game, so many ODD stuff, all wich is unexplained.  Ive never seen anybody posting a theory involving really ALL of the glyphs and clues to make a proper theory wich makes sense.   So therefore theres still a shit ton of questions.  Most people here cant wait untill a new clue is find, untill something new appears, a new way we can go, but we havent  even finished the ""old"" way, the glyphs are still unexplained,   we have clues, but people here seem to completly ignore them only because they cant figure out what they mean (me included).   Its always the same, someone posts a really good theory, people upvote it, but the theory ignores half of the glyphs or other clues, and thats why i think theres still something to find in this game, no matter what, must not be a jetpack, i would be happy enough if this all just leads to a little room with a small text saying something like congratulations, you solved this or how r* would propably say theres nothing here, groove along :-P"

chiliadmystery,3dm8i2,stargateheaven,2,Fri Jul 17 13:01:13 2015 UTC,I didn't see any egg logos - the box with the writing on was standing on its own with a few stacks of unidentifiable boxes dotted around the room also. In the same building just to the left of the one with the boxes there is a window into  room that appears to have no ceiling (you can see through the ceiling onto a specific part of the mountain) however when you go on top of or around the room there is no missing ceiling or window that could result in that view - might be a glitch but it seems deliberate - going to go and explore the section of the mountain shown when I'm back at home and will post all images then.   Sorry if I;m duplicating - I don't normally post but spotted this yday and couldn't see any existing posts that mention.

chiliadmystery,3dkaso,arist0t13,2,Fri Jul 17 18:23:43 2015 UTC,"I can understand how some people feel they are insignificant. The reason they come across as significant to me is, they are always respawned at the same time, and the material used to make the web is really thick/crude/ugly, doesn't even look like a real spiderweb which would be a lot thinner IMO. And they are really distinct patterns. That's why I think they mean something  edit: also like to add that someone on here viewed the web textures in the game files, they are named starting with elec_ which SUPPOSEDLY suggest they are made out of the same material as the electrical wiring which makes it even more suspicious"
chiliadmystery,3dkaso,Frostlandia,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:30:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I don't quite understand why that would make it more suspicious. Could you explain?"
chiliadmystery,3dkaso,arist0t13,2,Fri Jul 17 18:59:49 2015 UTC,"well imo this game tries to be as realistic as possible, as far as environmental factors go (animals, weather etc.) think of the size of our character's finger for example, compared to the thickness of one strand of the strange in game web. if it were just a normal spiderweb why would they purposely make it that ugly and thick looking? in real life you can barely see webs unless sunlight is shining on them or they are wet, think about how many times youve been walking somewhere and walked into a web on your face, you dont even see it until you walk into it.  this web in game looks like some weird cliche fake spiderweb decoration that you'd buy at a holloween store. the filename elec_ as was discussed in another thread maybe suggest the web is being made out of electrical wire (which it actually looks like in the game, black colored and thick, not super-thin and silver like an actual spiderweb)"
chiliadmystery,3dkaso,DreamingDjinn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:21:43 2015 UTC,Not to mention the common method of making a spiderweb in a game is:     Step 1: Create a simple flat plane. Step 2: Project an image of a spider web. Step 3: ???? Step 4: Your web is complete.     The ??? is when you'd be tweaking the shape of the plane. Think of it like a piece of paper with a spiderweb printed on it.

Also, the news reports at some point after a mission with trevor and franklin that more hitchhikers have gone missing today. How could that be trevor abducting them when he was elsewhere on a mission with 2 others? I think its all clues to show us trevor isnt as bad as we may think.

But still someone else is taking people not trevor..quite frankly im not sure we are to even take part in altruist.we arent there for extra money...the only reason trevor refers to them as friends is because in beginning of game, when we first meet Trevor, Ron texts and says ""I just spoke to the people up in the mts they said you can bring them any lost souls for a reward, they said they just want to have them for dinner"". However Trevor delivers weapons to them, thats why Ron was there in the first place, they do business together so they are friends.  Having for dinner could also mean simply having them for dinner (just have a talk) or they could really be eating them...  tevor throughout story gives off his sensitive side...trevor does have a heart buried deep in there. The story throws us around trying to confuse us to who we think is good or bad. It's meant to confuse us its part of a great story that is really rich in detail if you pay attention...you can learn a lot about the characters lives....but listen carefully!"

A month or two ago we were wondering about the ""correct"" order of kidnapping/delivering random pickups based on a musical cue we were hearing. Trevor acts surprised when he finds out about the Altruists via the doomsayer, and then the doomsayer tells him to seek them out. Perhaps instead of taking the first pick-up simply after you get the prompt, you need to speak to the doomsayer first?     Sorry I don't remember the particular doomsayer's name.

Since nobody seems to know what they're good for and they seem to be very small and/or invisible I thought I've maybe stumbled about one that is used as trigger or what ever and asked if there's a way to check what it is.

Long story short; iAmSmokey is correct. GTAV handles it's LODs this way. Everything from lampposts to bus shelters fade away in this manner (with a grainy effect). It bothered lots of people on the GTAV subreddits when the game came out who thought it looked bad on full graphical settings."
chiliadmystery,3dixfx,WarBob,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:37:53 2015 UTC,"Even more grainy here  Normal texture for comparison  This is gonna sound like horse shit because you can't make it out in the picture but there appears to be sort of a hidden image/diagram, like a mural of sorts on the underside of the UFO from that angle. 99% sure it's jesus toast but it looks like it to me. Can't make out exactly what it is though, it looks like two pincers.  I've been with the UFO for almost 24 hours in game which is why it's there in the daylight."
chiliadmystery,3dixfx,grime-dont-play,0,Thu Jul 16 17:20:41 2015 UTC,"I can't agree or disagree with the image in the grain as you say, but probably because it is a still image. I HAVE however seen the film grain effect itself. You are standing left of where the viewing platform is, correct? I've only seen that grainy effect on that side at a distance close to where it starts to disappear, and your second pic looks to be the spot I was standing. Now I didn't think anything of it at the time, because I was just showing my lil' sis the UFO, so I didn't really look to see if the grain effect happens on the right side near the lift building as well or if it is contained to just that one side. Are you still near? Can you do a little more testing for me? I may have a theory if that one spot is a specific trigger for that grain."
chiliadmystery,3dixfx,grime-dont-play,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:08:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not still near it unfortunately, I closed the game about 10 mins ago to go play some Rocket League. While I was there I did climb on top of the cable car shed though, and the UFO was completely invisible from there."
chiliadmystery,3dixfx,head_bussin,2,Thu Jul 16 18:15:17 2015 UTC,"Hm... I'm not going to waste an entire post on a crackpot theory I can't even test (360 in storage, I'm essentially living in a car for now), but with all the talk of the sun and the moon and aligning some sort of eclipse, I wonder...  Is there some time and date (or period of the moon/sun cycle) where from that spot you could align the UFO to show that grain but have the moon or sun directly behind it? If what you said about seeing some sort of outline or image in the grain is actually NOT Jesus-Toast, then maybe having that light behind it would reveal an image or clue.  If anyone is lost as to what I mean, think of the Glyphs seen all over Mt. C and the Hippy Camp. They all sorta have a similar design, a circle inside an oval, sorta resembling an eye. Maybe the inner circle of the glyph is the sun or moon directly behind the UFO (the UFO represented as the outer oval shape of the glyph).  Now yes there are holes in my theory especially where the glyphs are concerned because: A. The line through the center of the glyphs isn't accounted for B. The images under glyphs (ie. cloud, moon, mountain) are already assumed to be directly related to the chiliad UFOs appearance, and I really can't further link them to my theory without throwing out more hypotheses at you guys. I try to keep as much speculation out as possible."

Nobody cares or wants to hear what you think about why we're all dumb. Most of us realize this is nothing more than a wild goose chase, but it gives us a reason to get on. It gives us a reason to play when we've already 100%'d the game. Not to mention it can be pretty fun to try to put some of these pieces together.  Now please try to get this thread back on-track."
chiliadmystery,3dhbmi,five-nights,2,Thu Jul 16 22:52:26 2015 UTC,"So, I was flying around this evening in the few minutes I had to play. Sorry if this seems a little toasty, but I'm absolutely convinced that the jail is a spiderweb in and of itself. It makes sense symbolically, not to mention the many implications that it has in the actual game world.     I don't think I have to really explain how a jail is equatable to a spider web symbolically, but I might as well for the sake of being thorough. Imagine the government/law enforcement as the spider, and the criminals as the flies that get caught in their web. The criminals get placed in this web in order to drain the life out of them. Either enough that they never commit the crime again, or so much so that they die (in any of the various ways).     Now to explain my picture. I was zooming around in the classic ""I'm somewhere on foot oh god where is the parachute on the map"" helicopter. As I was leaving the VineWood hills radio station, I noticed a familiar shape. At first I thought that the line-up of the buildings looked like the Zancudo UFO. However, as I hovered around it, I realized that the way the lighting and the shadows were cast, it appeared to form a complete spider web shape, not dissimilar to the one on the Observatory door. This was the best picture I was able to take of it.     I encourage you guys to check the jail out in-game from different angles. A picture doesn't do it justice. But I don't know how the lighting/shadows are on the consoles.  Anywhoo, Kifflom, hope I'm not just crazy.  I do also want to add that the shape that the odd pointy buildings near the middle reminds me of a star. But I'm so hesitant to throw out the tired ""Shoot for the stars! yeah it's gotta be it!"" that I see around here. For now let's just focus on the web aspects of it and what this may mean."
chiliadmystery,3dhbmi,Diafetus,3,Thu Jul 16 08:14:12 2015 UTC,I haven't paid much attention for the spider web leads but maybe this is one of the things you have to see at night? Because i thought some one was saying we needs 3 webs and we found 2 that show up at night or something... Nice find though!
chiliadmystery,3dhbmi,therealgreenbeans,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:04:29 2015 UTC,"I do believe most tend to show up at night, yes.

chiliadmystery,3dlrx3,arist0t13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:26:51 2015 UTC,"So what I find very weird about these are how few and far between they are. At the moment, there's not much rhyme or reason as to where they're cropping up, other than on the terrain. To the best of my understanding, these generally wouldn't be something that could occur by something simple like bad UVs. They're too specific.     I don't understand RAGE engine very well, but I like to think I have a decent understanding of game engines and an ok grasp on 3D asset creation. When it comes to something like terrain, usually it is a giant model that has multiple textures assigned to it. It has a basic ""this is everywhere"" texture, and several textures that can be painted on and blended with the basic texture to make things like rocky dirt, dirt, and other small details (you can see an example of this if you closely examine Chiliad and other mountains). Usually the UVs are more or less perfect. If they're wonky in one spot, they'll generally be wonky in the general area of said wonkiness.     These textures look different than most ""bad UV"" textures. This one makes me think of a lawnmower cut, but it's very clearly the same image that occurs under water.     These also remind me a lot of Omega's tiny UFO for some reason. A Tiny UFO would make tiny crop circles, wouldn't it?"

chiliadmystery,3di91u,Matthewrotherham,2,Thu Jul 16 14:13:43 2015 UTC,I see what you're getting at here. I'm not into coding but maybe someone that is can check to see what changes during one of the missions where the door unlocks. If we find that difference maybe it can be checked against other lines of code in the game and we can determine what factors have to be in place to open hidden doors.
chiliadmystery,3di91u,Tigeruky,2,Thu Jul 16 17:38:43 2015 UTC,"This would be the best place to start.   This & the doors to rooms we already know exist (book depository, the Zancudo elevator and so on) and all the Epsilon quests, major story quests and then work backwards."

chiliadmystery,3di91u,denturedocelot,2,Fri Jul 17 00:22:44 2015 UTC,"Aside from the prerequisites like time, or mission, I spend alot of my game time running into doors to see if they open. Just the other day I found a trailer in Stab City that has an interior. Not much but a dude at a desk, but with the size of this game, I think its a valid approach."
chiliadmystery,3di91u,myinnertrevor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:41:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, its about deductive logic.  We have a list of places with interiors, we know what prerequisites are most likely to be fruitful (or some people will lean to certain ones given their own ideas) It's just a matter of trying the ones we think most likely to work, reporting them and working back from there.  Holmesian strategy my friends.   We already know the where, it's the when and with who we really need. (I am sticking to my guns that the zancudo elevator is the place)"
chiliadmystery,3di91u,YourAdultFriend,2,Thu Jul 16 23:12:55 2015 UTC,"Interesting theory. So you saying something like the secret Simeon mission, where once we go past a point in the story , we can't enter/activate it. Seems possible, my guess if it is any door in game, its the FZ bunker elevator, imo. But there are others that are suspect. T1, T2 doors in tunnel."
chiliadmystery,3di91u,lordofthefat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:48:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think launching a full scale investigation like this would be worthwhile, as I think the mystery is clearly intended to be done after you complete the game (""Come back when your story is complete""), That said, doing it may very well find some kind of unrelated easter egg, so it may be worthwhile trying.  As far as the mystery's go however, searching for accessible doors I think is very worthwhile, as well as other hidden interiors.  I only just realized today that there are 2 types of shipping containers, large and small, and the small ones have visible locks on them that, when exploded (shooting or meleeing doesn't work) opens them. I found two in paleto bay and one near the oilfields with nothing inside them, but chances are there's a lot more and they'd be great to hide tiny things in. Also this lock mechanic may appear in other ways as well that's gone unnoticed. I'm reminded of the altruist camp box that has a visible lock, though you can't blow that open.  I plan on exploring the chilliad area for possible interiors and such (hidden caves, doors, ect.) The game already has decently well hidden caves that have been found (The one with the spaceship part, the altruist cave) and both are hard to see unless you're up close to them."
chiliadmystery,3di91u,MediumBloke,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:05:53 2015 UTC,"So, this is my first time ever posting on reddit, I believe. Or, at least the only post I care about. So, bare with me, but I've been thinking and trying the same thing the OP has. I've played through once and got to 90% just for fun. But, I've started a new game, trying to do everything single possible thing I can with each character, story wise that is. I have been calling every single person in my contacts after every mission, after every race, after I do anything. I've even spent a few days calling people at specific times based on theories I have read wherein their character has a tie to a number if anything obscure I can think of, hoping to get new results or something different. I'm only like 5% through this play through so far just because of how time consuming it is.  But, back to what the OP was talking about. I have to run the game at it's absolute lowest just to get a some times steady 30fps. And, running the game that low causes some really interesting appearances with doors. Usually when the game is run with high enough graphics everything looks about right. But, the details of the doors are kinda off. As in, the doors that you can inter at some point in the game where it be story or otherwise has slightly high detail to it than the doors you can't enter. I can take some pictures for comparison, but, it's a very similar affect you get in old cartoons, where you know what was going to be animated in the scene just cause it was more detailed. The same thing happened in older GTA titles as well. Such as GTA:VC/SA. Some of you may know what I'm talking about. Anyway, I've noticed that the doors that seem to have this effect (that you can't just open) are usually doors with some sort of ""power station"" or label on it or near it, doors that are really obscurely placed, the doors in all the tunnels, the doors to all the properties you can buy in the story mode."

The narrow road with nothing stopping me from simply slipping away. The darkening skies that churned and swelled with rain, threatening to began to pour down at any moment.  As I neared the peak, I began to notice a form in the sky. A sort of haze of heat forming a vague shape of oblong sort. As the first pellets of rain began to patter down it washed over the figure like an umbrella. This make the shape clearer, revealing it's true form.  As I grew closer and closer to this mass a booming sound erupted forth from its visage. Like a wave of destruction the air around the UFO blew in such a wild nature it threatened to send Micheal and his car tumbling down into a now blackened abyss.  Realizing my only hope was to progress on foot as the car began it's tumble to oblivion I left it, opting to continue. In pursuit of the truth.  From that blast of air came the sound of steam rushing from the UFO, as bolts began to slide back, releasing a hatch. Realizing this may be my only chance ever to enter the UFO we had been striving to pry inside of for years now, I lept forth.  Entering the door, Micheal collasped to the ground from exhaustion of battling the winds with his leap of faith. He then did the dinosaur.  Killme"

Still, I love reading a lot of the ides posted here because they go to show - a) Things you may have missed about the game and b) Links between things that aren't obvious to you because of your culture or knowledge.  However, there are a lot of ideas which worry me and people who seem to get way too obsessed with ideas such as linking the game to theories about masonic symbols and golden ratios or them being the new messiah in some cult.  Then this type of thing will always bring out the crazies and, apart from the odd bout of doxing, death threats and shadowbans, it's mostly harmless."

Wouldn't make any sense for it not to be. Plus it spawns and disappears. IMO the jet pack is in it. How to get it out is the question. Also I feel like the bottom left glyph on the mural is trying to tell us there is a pilot-able ufo in game. That's what I've thought since I first looked at it.   The fact we haven't found this stuff yet is perturbing to say the least and it's making me skeptic. But I think part of the mystery here is that R* wants us to ""believe"" in this mystery, they want us to put on the tinfoil hats and start drawing golden ratio on map overlays.

There's probably some way to get the key for it. Bringing the right combo of people up with the right stats, and the right conditions.   My real conspiracy is that the jet pack is either at the altruists or the fort, and has some kind of event we haven't discovered and the ufo is either at the fort or the hippy camp and again, some event we haven't uncovered. Seems like a moon phase/eclipse thing. Maybe something has to be done before the thing (whatever it is) can be unlocked for us. But I don't think it goes too far beyond that."

chiliadmystery,3ddhqf,Jakeab89,4,Wed Jul 15 18:07:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree that a lot of these theories ""that arnt based off any in game prompt [are not - I'm assuming that's what you meant] really realistic.""  I don't think that's necessarily a problem in itself. It can be fun to imagine fictional back stories about GTAV. The problem is when the 'theories' start to confuse the game world and the real world.  Sometimes the mystery hunt reminds me of grade school. I remember a few kids who, during lunch break, would brag about a really cool toy they just bought, or start describing an awesome scene in a movie that their mom took them to see over the weekend, a movie that nobody had ever heard of... maybe like a Back to the Future prequel starring Douglas Fairbanks, with ninjas, transformers, and ponies in it.  We'd all say ""wow!"", and inevitably one person would ask, ""will you bring the toy tomorrow to show us?"" or ""where did you see that movie?"" And then the kid would pause for a second and sort of mutter, ""Oh, uh, no, I just made it up. But isn't it neat? I mean, don't you think that would be cool if it was real?""  Everyone else would groan, and then the kid would slowly sneak away in shame, eventually to go troll a different group of friends on the other side of the classroom.  All of the clues we need (or needed) to solve the mystery should already be in the game, not in our imagination.  We already know that Rockstar uses social media to harvest ideas for game design. Maybe GTA 6 will feature time travel and earthquakes and battles with giant spiders from outer space.  Anyway we could spend all day imagining scenarios like that, but it won't help us understand Rockstar's intentions with the mural. If we want to understand this game, then we need to stick to what actually exists in the game and in the files.  Edit: typos"

chiliadmystery,3ddelx,AnEvilVet,3,Thu Jul 16 11:18:26 2015 UTC,"I personally believe that the graffiti ties into their beliefs. The Cultstoppers website ingame says that they're nocturnal and they believe in an alien called Lord Zapho.  I think that they are depicting the Chiliad UFO as both a sun and an eye.  When you're at the camp, you can clearly see where the Chiliad UFO appears.    The Altruists are nocturnal so it doesn't make sense for them to depict the rising and mid-day sun as this is when they're asleep.  Well, the other big round thing in the sky that's all lit up is the Chiliad UFO.  Similar to how the sun rises and sets, the Chiliad UFO fades in and out of existence.  Also 3am would be the middle of their day, maybe they've become nocturnal so they can observe it better.  I also believe that they believe the UFO to be the alien Lord Zapho waking up.  As well as looking like a sun, the graffiti also resemble an eye, hence the pupil/dot in the middle.  The appearance of a UFO near to their camp probably reaffirms their belief that Lord Zapho is real and will soon arrive.    If you go down the rabbit hole of Scientology, one of their beliefs is the dictator of the galaxy took millions of his people and murdered them next to volcanoes and there is a lot of evidence in game that Chiliad is an extinct/dormant volcano.  Having a UFO appear next to what used to be a volcano is a nice reference to Scientology to go alongside Epsilonism.  So what do the glyphs tell us to do?  In all honesty I don't believe they tell us to do anything.  Like the Infinite 8 mystery and Ghost clues, they are just there to give a bit of backstory if you can link all of the ingame evidence together."

chiliadmystery,3ddelx,DeepThroatTNO,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:11:50 2015 UTC,No problem.  Personally I don't read too much into the fact that the Altruist peds spawn during the day as well as the night.  It's probably just something the devs didn't take into account or was done intentionally so you can always drop the hitch-hikers off at any time of day.
chiliadmystery,3ddelx,DeepThroatTNO,0,Wed Jul 15 13:20:43 2015 UTC,That makes sense
chiliadmystery,3ddelx,RedditResin420,5,Wed Jul 15 13:22:43 2015 UTC,"You are partially incorrect about the history here and it is important that the sequence of events that led to all significant findings are laid out in a correct fashion so that it ultimately does not suggest something that is untrue.  The only UFO that was found by using the mural and the glyphs was the Mt. Chiliad UFO. But this is still highly disputed to be an accurate interpretation to this day, even though it was what led us there, don't ask me why. Some people even disputed that the mural was a depiction of Mt. Chiliad.  The other three UFOs, in Paleto Bay, Zancudo and Sandy Shores, were all found accidentally while people were just flying around. This is actually documented on certain websites were the earliest known findings were recorded and sorted and they were all just happy accidents.  When nothing else was found, people went back to the mural thinking it held more secrets. And thus began the jetpack hunt, the Epsilonism theories, discussions on karma playthroughs, moon phases and so on. The game file findings such as the meteor and the alien egg also inspired people to keep looking or suggesting that we had not gone about this the completely right way yet.  Because the UFOs were found without using the mural, some people have suggested that the mural was actually meant to point us to them and most people here obviously do not agree with that theory, otherwise they wouldn't be here in the first place.  Some people think that the symbols on the bottom are depicting a sequence of events. First the UFOs appear, then there is an (alien) egg and then finally a jet pack.  I still am fairly convinced that the bottom symbols are meant to be pointing us to the three other UFOs. The broken egg symbolizes the broken, sunken UFO in Paleto Bay, a town where the egg is a recurring theme on signs for bars, businesses and in sculptures.  The connecting line between the UFO (Sandy Shores) and the jet pack man (Zancudo) suggests that those two UFOs share a quality or are the same in that they can be found by similar methods such as finding a clue on the ground (UFO on top of a car and the light projected on the bunker) and then going straight up in the air.  The line coming down from the Eye at the top (a symbol which can be found beneath the observation deck on Mt. Chiliad) to the cracking egg (Paleto Bay) suggests a height difference. One is floating high above the tallest mountain in the game, while the other is at the bottom of the sea."

chiliadmystery,3ddelx,Simplefly,2,Wed Jul 15 17:32:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is an old theory and I shouldn't take credit. This was actually one of the first interpretations of the mural after the UFOs were found and people were trying to figure out the bottom symbols' relevance. If you come to this subreddit now it is for the random graffiti, epsilon prophecies, karma play through suggestions, random series of triggers that will ultimately be satisfactory somehow or jesus toast."

Everything since then has been what this subreddit is now if you go back out and press ""NEW"".  Occasionally someone stumbles onto something that gets people excited, even me sometimes. But ultimately it just goes away. That's really the best way to describe it.  And then new people discover the subreddit and repost the same findings that are from 2013. And on goes the cycle."
chiliadmystery,3ddelx,Jakeab89,2,Fri Jul 17 06:54:16 2015 UTC,"I have seen a few posts that say the spectrometer reference in the game is a hint to this. In real life, a spectrometer is a thing that goes on a telescope to filter light. Therefore in the game it refers to two things. Telescopes & the light spectrum. Their theory is that you first arrange the quotes & symbols by color (i.e. ROY G BIV) Then you do those actions in order & at the right times at different places that have telescopes. This is the part I get lost at. Do you do it all with one character or does each character need to be positioned at a different location.  If I has to guess the color of the words corresponds to the three characters and they each need to look through different telescopes. Look at what is beyond me. It makes sense to look at the UFOs. There's the platform at the mountain & the platform at the hippy camp. However there's no platform near the base. There is a platform with telescopes out in the middle of the desert but it's not the same as the other two therefore I don't think that's the correct place."

I'm playing through again right now, pretending I know nothing, and looking Around a bunch, there's nothing really that hints that's there's something more to do other than see the ufos. One at zancudo, referenced by the jet pack, one at the hippy camp as referenced by the ufo glyph, and one at the mtn the egg with the line connecting it to the ufo. It seems pretty simple and obvious. The lines indicate that they have to be traveled to, and the other glyphs tell you what conditions you need to see them. I think that's it. And that's that.   I plan to continue my hunt in the hopes of some great breakthrough, but I think we've already cracked it, right in the beginning, basically the same as every other game that comes out.   Though I have to say that the mural screams that there's a way into the mountain for awesome rewards, but that would be too straight forward, hence our mystery. The rewards are the red herring.

chiliadmystery,3ddhe8,WarBob,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:22:37 2015 UTC,"Unlikely. Having one person have DLC download to their hard drive that other's don't already contain would cause issues with going online and syncing with others, etc.  Even DLC you don't have access to/own is already present on your hard drive, so given said DLC is not currently in the active build of GTAV I would say probably not.  Not only that but the suggestion or question is almost like saying ""how long is a piece of string"". Example: What if sending an email to Rockstar with the subject ""Chiliad Bananas Magoo"" caused an automated email to respond that tells us we've won a free trip to visit Rockstar North?"

chiliadmystery,3ddhe8,DC_Millions,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:01:42 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to all the people giving you crap. This is actually the obvious solution to preventing the mystery being cracked by anything other than gameplay.    This kind of thinking is why I wanted to look through the source code for the ifruit android app so badly a while ago.    Also just a reminder to the community that in the legal text screen at the beginning of starting up the game it says something like ""in - game rewards may require something something from R*"". Obviously that's not the quote if anyone doubts me load up your game and read the screen with legal print.    2 more quick things.    Comparing disc's will not help and new data/saves/dlc are not stored on disc but on hard drive.    There are thousands of lines of code no one can read and a single encrypted key/password could easily unlock something hidden on the disc however. That would still require an Internet connection meaning it wouldn't be solvable out of the box but who knows. Calling it dlc wouldn't be right though. The content would have always been there it just needed a key from outside the disc to decrypt the content"
chiliadmystery,3ddhe8,Milnah23,-2,Thu Jul 16 00:00:23 2015 UTC,"right, okay. can we back up and rethink this whole post because it is literal nonsense from start to finish. why would rockstar spend years developing dlc so when it finally comes to it being released, they add an activation code that can only be required by solving a mystery that the majority of people playing have stopped believing even exists? and the small amount of people that do, who look for it with most of their free time have made zero discoveries with any meat to them for well over a year? sorry for being a bit aggressive, but this post is everything that's wrong with this sub at the moment; nonsensical conjecture. just talking pure shit."
chiliadmystery,3ddhe8,loopingleaphead,2,Wed Jul 15 15:22:53 2015 UTC,"This is a perfectly logical theory. The mystery is for the hardcore GTA fans. Why wouldn't they put some effort into making a little bonus content for the fans? The (free) DLC option makes more sense than scattering the files around hidden within other textures and models.   It would be as simple as imprinting a unique serial number on each licensed copy and using an algorithm to make a unique dlc code after all requirements are activated. A function like that would be easy to hide, and easy to make complex. There are functions found within the code that create strings and variables that seem to go nowhere, or make no sense. For instance, clearing the altruist camp creates a string that sets the time to 18 minutes ahead iirc. This could be a small part of that function."
chiliadmystery,3ddhe8,gazzy82,0,Wed Jul 15 16:39:47 2015 UTC,If they had said dlc they would have put a price tag on it by now. They are all about the $$ these days. I'd be very surprised if this was the case. At this point i'm pretty sure there is nothing for us to find.
chiliadmystery,3ddhe8,Enzemo,2,Wed Jul 15 18:01:12 2015 UTC,But what if the DLC is free and invisible on Steam/PS4/etc until the code is entered?  They might do it this way so that people couldn't browse the game files and find the jetpack that way.  The only way to get it would be to solve the mystery and then download it.
chiliadmystery,3ddhe8,gazzy82,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:17:27 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if it's actually possible to hide DLC on steam - has it ever been done before for any released game?

It seems to be largely ignored that many people, some game devs themselves (myself), have had access to the game files for months now, and pretty much categorically nothing was found."
chiliadmystery,3dh08n,b3457_m0d3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:24:18 2015 UTC,"A very strong case can be made for DLC being the next step in the mystery, that's true. But there is a lot of interesting stuff in those radio stations, a lot of possible clues, and I don't think they can be fully discounted as a part of the mystery yet.   For example, Social Club keeps track of what music you were listening to when you upload pics."

Like if it's raining does it change? If not, perhaps the 125* heat is an indicator. After all, none of the characters ever remark how hot the weather is. 125* is a big deal. People stay inside when it's 110.       Could the lens flare we're seeing in the image actually be not the sunset itself, but a reflection of the sun at the right time?   Unrelated to the alamo sea, but has anyone noticed the tides affect the water at the dam? When I was hunting for UFO parts, I noticed that the water rose decently higher than the little dock that's located near the dam."
chiliadmystery,3dchzx,DreamingDjinn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:58:50 2015 UTC,You sure your not thinking of that floating dock? The one with the tire on it? The next time it's raining I'll check it.
chiliadmystery,3dchzx,MediumBloke,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:06:50 2015 UTC,"No, it was a stationary wooden dock at the Land Act dam. The water was at least knee-deep, and it receded over the time I was there. I chalked it up to them using the same body of water that they used for the ocean, but that doesn't quite sit right with me.  Have some screenshots!   These aren't of the water rising over the dock, as I didn't have more time than to jump on, jack a helicopter, and come here before I have to get ready for work. If you'll notice, the water is pretty close to the dock, but nowhere near as high as it was when I noticed it. The dock was completely flooded. I looked around to see if water was being added anywhere (there are some drainage pipes nearby so I figured they might be working) but there was nothing.     However, I was in UFO part-finding mode, so I didn't give it more than a few minutes before I was back to hunting."
chiliadmystery,3d9uoa,bfr0g1,15,Tue Jul 14 17:01:38 2015 UTC,"All random events are known. There is a checklist accessible through the rockstar social club. This even with Simeon is also on the list. Also, it is known to be the only missable event."
chiliadmystery,3d9uoa,TheTrueRedRonin,0,Tue Jul 14 17:35:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm sure they would show you the ones needed for completion but we are on a subreddit about Easter eggs. they wouldn't have a chilliad checkpoint for earning the ufo online... I was playing a new save the other day and had a ? for Franklin show up at around 1-2 am that disappeared by the time I noticed it. It was before the merry weather heist and I ended up moving on to just do the mission.  the best way to hide something in this game would be between missions where your character should roam around and do things because doing all the heists in like 15-20 days ingame time is unrealistic for robbing multiple huge things and sitting on the cash. If you play just for the missions the game is really fast to speed through so I think we need a thorough slow approach to the story. Even switching between characters gives tiny bits of back story. Like at the start of the game switching between M and F shows M owes money to people on the phone but who? There is still a lot not found IMO.
chiliadmystery,3d9uoa,Waterypyro,3,Tue Jul 14 23:21:42 2015 UTC,I think that part you're talking about in the story is when Michael owes money to Martin Madrazo for tearing down his deck during a previous mission.
chiliadmystery,3d9uoa,TheTrueRedRonin,-1,Wed Jul 15 00:04:58 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about right after frank and M meet over Jimmys car. I know this because when the multiplayer came out for ps3 it sucked and kept bringing everybody back to single player so I had a new save I was playing and multiple times when getting disconected it would cut to M on his phone on a bench or something saying calmly I might add ""yeah yeah you will get your money"""
chiliadmystery,3d9uoa,Waterypyro,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:49:00 2015 UTC,"14 of the total 57 (60 for enhanced edition) are required for 100% completion. I think all of them are meant to be encountered naturally, at least on a first play through. This game is played pretty extensively by a lot of people, so I think that any that turn up naturally have all been discovered. I've never seen any documentation of random events that aren't on the checklist.  If you are generally saying that there could be some event that has to be triggered in a special way (something we all are looking for) then I agree with that. If there is a Chiliad Mystery, then I hope it's a little more than cave drawings and the UFO's (although those are still pretty interesting). I'm just saying that this particular random event with Simeon is special in its restrictions on story progress, but that people have known about it for a long time, and it's also been known that it's the only listed random event with this type of restriction.  Now about your question mark, lots of the Strangers and Freaks missions (indicated by question marks) have time restrictions, and their icons will come and go as they are accessible/inaccessible. If you really think it's special then you should look up where all the Strangers and Freaks missions start, and compare their locations to where you saw your Strangers and Freaks icon. If you really found a Strangers and Freaks mission that no one has posted before and isn't on any wiki's, then I would say post proof right on this sub."
chiliadmystery,3d9uoa,TheTrueRedRonin,-1,Tue Jul 14 23:41:48 2015 UTC,I have 6 different saves for testing I know about extensive research and I have been here since the start of the ps3/xbox360 hunt. I have seen every post you can think of when brining the information up. What I am talking about is more centered on the game mechanics and thinking why would this be here if it wasn't slightly important. Hence me bringing up the switching mechanic which isn't used much at the start and the fact that some things are timed and you can only do some missions at a certain part.

chiliadmystery,3d8jfn,gerstec,2,Tue Jul 14 13:34:06 2015 UTC,The rail gun isn't actually an alien weapon. It's a real life human weapon that has been tested by our own government. There's even YouTube videos of people making small scale versions. A rail gun is very different from a standard powder gun. It uses magnetic and electric force to discharge the projectile. Normal guns use a powder that is inside a tightly sealed she'll that is ignited from the firing pin thus discharging the bullet. Both achieve the same goal: launch a projectile.  The just use different methods to achieve that goal.

But this is interesting, we could reverse search by knowing that when the spider webs load they have to load certain files, so we create a scanner that lets us know when those files are loaded.  You fly around the map and as long as you are within those time limits it should trigger the file load and notification that it loaded to tell us.  It will take a better person than me to actually implement this idea though, but I know it's technically possible because they did the same exact thing for the alien egg game files."

If there's an underwater entrance to the Fort it's far out in the ocean and not close to the base. The waters are simply not deep enough directly around it and there's no path leading to it like it's the case with the tunnel at the Humane Labs.

Not sure why that popped into my head, because it's not like having multiple players opened the doors, but I feel like it might be something different to try...  Still, wonder why it popped opened in that scenario? Maybe a glitch?"

chiliadmystery,3d2c1g,DopeBoy187,2,Mon Jul 13 04:12:13 2015 UTC,"I was doing the same thing - Except in GTA: Online. I went into that building connected to the larger control tower. If you walk up the stairs, you can get into the control tower itself, and up at the top is another elevator that does the same thing. I'm wondering if the elevator only goes up (if it goes at all). It's not impossible for it to go down though either...the question is just how to get it to move at all...  Also of note: Straight out from the runway is a crashed plane underwater. It's empty (also rusty and ripped to pieces) and there's largely nothing that interesting about it, but when you're sitting still in the submersible, there are a ton of eerie noises all around you. Some are the metal creaking, but others sound like some sort of creature. Could just be more metallic noises that have a slightly more organic sound, or maybe there's something in those depths. The water is insanely deep past the plane...Who knows what is out there."

This is probably just an easter egg to it, however interestingly enough, just as stated as before by previous threads here, power is at play. “When influenced by the electromagnetic state of the atmosphere a number of leeches ascended into the tubes; in doing which they dislodged the whalebone and caused the bell to ring.” That's talked about with the Tempest Prognosticator and I think it might have something to do with it."

chiliadmystery,3d1e7d,GiantSquidd,5,Sun Jul 12 18:58:19 2015 UTC,"Looks like toast.  I think all of the X topics should have the toast flair.    There are things to find on Chiliad.  We have found them.  They weren't X's.  Our strongest and most solid clues/paths to pursue, are what we should be focused on.  If there is anything to find it will most likely be through the use of things we have already confirmed.  Don't get me wrong, I like the toast and there's no harm in sometimes tasting the candy...but there's a limit.    There are many interesting shapes, shadows, cracks, lights..that could be something, but when you start to apply what we know and some kind of direction to go with them, they don't seem to lead to anything.  I don't see much effort from people, attempting to explain what they see, and giving a theory about the when, where, why and how, in application.  The same impulsive enthusiasm needs to bleed into testing and explanations, before assuming something is significant."
chiliadmystery,3d1e7d,moistboyz,3,Sun Jul 12 19:22:38 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with this. I want to call Jesus Toast on at least 90-95% of the crap I see on this subreddit sometimes...but I hold my tongue just in case I'm wrong. I wish we had a ""Jesus Toast"" button next to ""report"" lol just for this, but I'm sure the community can't be trusted with something that basically is another form of down voting to oblivion. People get really butt hurt over any dissent of their own opinion taking it as an attack on their sense of self, instead of cherishing and respecting the fact that having the freedom to even have your own opinion, being able to voice it, and being able to disagree with the other party without repercussions is in itself critically important and should be respected when ever possible even if you disagree with said individual.  On the flip side, I do kinda see something from the pics, kinda looks like a sun rise. But seriously it's a real stretch that this would have any meaning or be put there like that to intentionally tell you something. If it was intentional I feel it's way more of a haha look at what I hid, type of little thing that isn't important to anything else in the story.     BUT I still have to lean on the side of caution and call jesus toast unless there is any other reason not too...I've learned plenty of times over the years to NEVER EVER underestimate the power of the human mind to ""see things"" where they shouldn't be, aka the brains power to see patterns and make connections. As someone recently posted elsewhere on the internet(note I might be paraphrasing a little and I know these are not the exact words originally used but you get the point):      ""The human mind's ability to see patterns in data has single-handedly made some of the greatest discoveries and contributions to the human race we know of. But that same ability of our mind to make connections has also made some of the most well respected people of all time to make the most critical career ending claims of there being connections between things that are actually baseless, illogical, are obviously wrong, and otherwise should have never been uttered by an individual who claims sanity."""

I don't think people necessarily need to own the game anyway. As long as they actively play it, and are basing their ideas on what they've actually done in game, that might be enough.  I think in most cases, if posts include a detailed description of game play and testing (with or without pictures), that should show whether or not the OP actually played the game.  If posts are too vague, have nothing to do with game play, or describe something that is impossible (grabbing a shovel and digging a hole in the map, for example), it's already clear that the 'theory' is irrelevant... whether or not the poster owns the game."

To me it almost seems like a red herring, or false path(explained why below). Like what a lot of people don't keep in mind is that there are multiple mysteries, in jokes, easter eggs, etc. in this game that are inter-related but are not truly required for each other to be triggered, found, or experienced.     I will say though that if the epsilon side/back story does have some kind of true ""end game"" or true hidden triggered easter egg I don't think it has been found yet and could possibly be pretty huge. My argument for having this egg be there is that there were plenty of people seriously pissed when they found out in GTA: SA that there really wasn't any real easter egg with the epsilon cult even though they searched for one, made overlays, mapped out connections, and generally went overboard just like how some people where with finding bigfoot. It would be a good thing to please their fans with at least fleshing it out, but only fleshing it out and not putting anything more could just be it and that's the other side of this argument.      The other side is if R* intentionally left the epsilon story open ended and left out any big ""end game"" style easter eggs concerning it to keep it real to there being never ending going in circles BS from IRL cults that we know for a fact epsilonism is based on."

chiliadmystery,3cywq4,Plage,9,Sun Jul 12 01:13:34 2015 UTC,why is it definitely a hologram again?

chiliadmystery,3cywq4,Jayman9609,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:48:31 2015 UTC,Because we can't shoot at it or touch it in any way like we can with the other ufo's.
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,PrincessTia,5,Sun Jul 12 01:41:59 2015 UTC,I think that just means the developers didn't make a collision model for it.
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,Supakim1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:38:56 2015 UTC,And why ?
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,PrincessTia,2,Sun Jul 12 05:16:13 2015 UTC,I'm not a developer obviously so I don't really know. One guess might be that it's just a custscene prop from the alien mission where you can't interact with it. The easter egg is just a reused mission asset being summoned at a specific time and weather condition. Since you aren't supposed to interact with a cutscene there would be no reason to add a collision model. It's just a waste of time.
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,qbrainn,12,Sun Jul 12 06:18:43 2015 UTC,"Not agreeing, sorry.  The Sandy Shores UFO is the exact same ufo model as used for the Chiliad UFO, and that one has a collision model, and works fine when you approach it. Whatever the reason, it is more safe to assume that whats happening is intended, as oppose to a bug.  Another point is that they never fixed it in the ps4/xone version of even the pc version.  -Q"
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,ByrGenarHofoen,4,Sun Jul 12 06:28:25 2015 UTC,"Isn't the UFO from the Michael cutscene a totally different model, though?"
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,GiantSquidd,2,Sun Jul 12 13:55:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's essentially just an interior."
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,GiantSquidd,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:35:38 2015 UTC,What are you talking about here? The cutscene after Michael got spiked by Jimmy and wakes up in the back alley with the Monkeys around him? The UFO that beams him up seems to be of the same type than the ones over the hippy camp and the mount.
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,mazdarati2,2,Sun Jul 12 16:45:28 2015 UTC,"Apologies, I was referring to the interior model that you used to be able to spawn into online near the penris building. It was the one from the second part of the cutscene.  I couldn't find much on it but it was this although you could only see it from the outside. ...unless you had some kind of jetpack or something...  I just woke up when I wrote that last comment. My bad. :/"
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,ali3nzombi3,2,Sun Jul 12 17:14:34 2015 UTC,No need to apologize. I'm quite new to V and the mystery and don't know so many things that I'm sometimes not sure what you people are refering to. That's why I asked. I didn't knew this was possible in online for example.
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,diegooo1972,2,Sun Jul 12 18:41:17 2015 UTC,This doesn't makes sense because nobody creates a 3D model with a collision and then removes said collision just for a cutscene. Besides that you're forgetting that the UFO is also disappearing or getting transparent at a certain distance. So somebody has put effort in it to make it like that.
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,Supakim1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:49:41 2015 UTC,Yep!
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,Sparramadux,0,Sun Jul 12 01:48:40 2015 UTC,And that it disappears when you walk towards it.  What? I'm just stating a fact
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,pelvis69,2,Sun Jul 12 04:45:56 2015 UTC,"3 is the answer, but what is the question?"

Edit: Its been a long time, are there any solar panels within the lighthouse range?"
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,nemprime,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:42:59 2015 UTC,"I believe that this is all down to a gameplay decision rather than saying the UFO is a hologram.  All of the UFOs fade in and out because you have to be a certain distance from them to see them.  This isn't saying they have a cloak or that they are holograms, this is so you don't just see them from elsewhere on the map and spoil the hunt.  But why is the Chiliad UFO immaterial while the others aren't?  Well, given the position of the other UFOs, the only way to view them is to fly up (apart from the military one as you can see it from the ground because of how the sniper rifle zoom works).  Because you are flying, you can't just get out and walk around the UFO, there's even an element where the game pushes you away from the model so that you can't explore it too easily.  The Chiliad UFO is different because it's very close to the player being on foot.  Because of this, Rockstar couldn't add the same field to push you away because it would always be affecting you while you're on the top of the mountain.  Instead, they make it immaterial.  TL;DR - It's not a hologram, it's done this way so you don't get pushed down the mountain."
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,Jakeab89,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:43:44 2015 UTC,"Your theory is flawed simply because said force field isn't large enough to reach down to the mountain. It works 1 or 2 meters around the UFOs but not further. The only things that speak against a hologram are that it ""makes noise"" and that you can see it's ray of light/beam if you use one of the telescopes and zoom in."
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,delqhic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:14:00 2015 UTC,"Whilst I appreciate your opinion (and you may be right) there is literally no way to test how far this effect extends around the models.  Granted, the may not affect someone stood on top of the mountain but it would certainly affect people flying over the mountain or trying to land on top of the mountain at any point of the game, such as the side mission where you have to do exactly that in a parachute.  Also, the hype generated on reddit about the trailer and the 'shed' on top of the mountain would generate a lot of interest in getting to the summit quite early in the game.  I know it was the first thing that myself and a lot of other users I've talked to did when they first went exploring in the game world.  Your response also reminds me of what I feel is the biggest hindrance with getting a suitable answer to all of this.  As detailed and as beautiful as this game world is, it's still just a game.  In a game, things don't have to make necessarily make any kind of logical sense.  You identified that it can't be a hologram because it ""makes noise"".  Well, so what?  It's a video game, if Rockstar wanted it to be a UFO hologram that makes noise, why couldn't they?  After all, it's no less logical than having a UFO phase in and out of existence on top of a mountain during 3am in rainy weather.  I feel that sometimes people forget this fact and have to seek a logical link between things in the diegesis of the game.  Perhaps the ultimate answer to all of this is simply 'that's what they wanted it to look like'?  Thanks for the discussion though."
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,nemprime,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:15:27 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about the real force field it can be tested simply by walking on them. You'll hover about 1m above the UFO and won't make contact with the surface. If you're talking about what ever force the UFOs use to turn of engines of helicopters and jets even this distance can be measured but of course the radius is larger and indeed could influence aircrafts landing on top of the mountain for the time the UFO is there but it wouldn't affect side mission as the UFO only appears when you've 100% which means you'll have finished all these missions (correct?).  About the ""it's still just a game"" part I can just say that they still have to stay within some boundaries. Besides that I didn't said it can't be a hologram because of the sound. I just they that this is something a hologram doesn't do but who says there aren't any microphones hidden or an other way to generate the sound is used. Just for example Cris Formage's voice also comes out of nowhere in some mission without further explaination."
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,delqhic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:07:18 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about the real force field it can be tested simply by walking on them This only applies to whatever force is on the top of the UFO, their might be a stronger one underneath but we can't test that.   Also, whose to say that the field that turns off engines only affects flying craft? It may affect vehicles as well so that could affect the motorbikes on the summit or the police cars that invariably come after you up there.   I can just say that they still have to stay within some boundaries But that's the thing, no they don't.  This is a game with a ghost, bigfoot, rumours of screaming monsters in the subway, a hatch at the bottom of the ocean with someone tapping out morse code and more.  If Rockstar want to make a hologram that makes noise, then they can and that would be what it is.   Personally, I don't think it's a hologram at all, noise or not.  It's just a UFO that can fade in and out of existence because that's how the easter egg was designed."

chiliadmystery,3cywq4,delqhic,2,Sun Jul 12 02:07:03 2015 UTC,"Just to link the two together, could the chiliad ufo be the 'ghost' of the sunken ufo?"
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,nemprime,4,Sun Jul 12 08:05:31 2015 UTC,I think the FIB may have replicated it to try and attract Alien attention.
chiliadmystery,3cywq4,AstralIndigo,0,Sun Jul 12 09:21:26 2015 UTC,"Are they the same model? If so, that's a very good theory."

I mean they are all over the map. they're in the foothills of the unnamed mountains, and on some of the ground level rocks... And even if there are five on Chiliad that we are supposed to find, does anybody have any idea on what we would have to do next?  I'm sorry, but it really feels like everyone here lately is looking for the next big sexy clue instead of actually trying to make any sense of what they could actually be for. I'm not convinced this recent trend of seeing x's all over the place is what we need to be doing, but let's say it is ...what now? we've known about the glyphs forever now and they're obviously intentional, and we still don't know what they mean.  I think if we're going to scour Chiliad for clues, we should keep looking for those spiderwebs, they're obviously not Jesus toast and even have specific spawn times...  Edit: I'd like to remind everyone that the downvotes are not for disagreement, they're to bury comments that don't contribute to the discussion, and let's be honest... I'm one of the only ones here actually discussing what these things could mean rather than just celebrating finding them.

Our understanding hasn't been improved at all, we just have more loose ends and less focus. (if you honestly believe this isn't just paraidolea, that is)  I hope you understand that I'm not trying to be a dick or anything, but it truly feel this latest episode is barking up the wrong tree. Hell, it's not even a tree, this is barking up a lamppost. Again, don't take this personally, without skeptical analysis everything is a clue. :)"
chiliadmystery,3cwrsf,XxSCRAPOxX,7,Sat Jul 11 14:40:17 2015 UTC,"One of those five ""x's"" was clearly not real. It was just shading on a rock and didn't really even make an x,, Only four that look intentional were found. At least IMO. There's still another that would be large and clearly an x if this is even real. Could just be random ass textures. To me the power lines being intentionally weird and the no working generators and the 1.21gw are a bigger part of it than these x's."
chiliadmystery,3cwrsf,GiantSquidd,5,Sat Jul 11 14:49:59 2015 UTC,"I agree the power lines are more suspicious.  Whether or not there are five of these things that people want to think are important... why do people think they're important? I get it, there are x's on the mural... So what could the x's on Chiliad mean that the clearer more definable x's near T's airfield don't mean?  These are perpendicular lines that happen when humans who aren't very good at producing truly random things try to make things look random. (Not a dig at Rockstar, but humans in general)  If these things are important, I'll be as happy as anyone, but I'm asking the questions we need to ask before establishing anything as important or not, and all I seem to be getting in response is defensiveness and downvotes instead of any answers which would help our understanding."

chiliadmystery,3cxjiu,XxSCRAPOxX,2,Sat Jul 11 22:07:00 2015 UTC,"This is interesting as it seems like the map and some objects really have some ""crackmarks"" or how ever you want to call them. I mean there's the crack in the cupola of the observatory and you also have some strange cracklines on Mt. Chiliad for example that some people say are just graphic bugs but I'm a game artist and for me it really looks like these are predefined cracks relating to something that can be triggered by an earthquake for example and after that something like a cave will open up. Another thing that's on my mind since I discovered it is that you can actually move certain rocks on Mt. Chiliad which then will roll or fall down the hill side. I somehow have the feeling that this could maybe trigger a chain reaction which then maybe will open up something like said cave but this is pure speculation from my side. Has anybody every tried something in that direction?"
chiliadmystery,3cxjiu,Plage,2,Sat Jul 11 22:44:46 2015 UTC,"Has anybody every tried something in that direction?   Yeah, we were all trying to move rocks with the cargobob for a while...

chiliadmystery,3d0ov9,gazzy82,3,Sun Jul 12 15:18:16 2015 UTC,"I have done my own small scale investigation of the Cargo Bob above FZ. I found out that it does the same flight path every time you leave and come back, it goes from the west side of the fort by the control tower and flies east over the hangar and middle of the fort. After a short period of time the helicopter always takes the same flight path west out over the ocean past the vehicle limits on the map. So while I agree with you that it should be looked into maybe a little more than what little I did, it most likely is a dead end.   I have 100% and I was doing this as Michael only. Maybe try it with Trevor or Franklin or all 3."

chiliadmystery,3cvumu,Bierfreund,3,Sat Jul 11 05:19:45 2015 UTC,"I loaded up the vanilla version on ps3 last night...there are X's everywhere on the mountain if you look long enough.    If I were to try to map all of the X's I encountered that I observed, there would be well over 50, just on one relatively small area/side of Chiliad.    I think the scope of searching is too narrow and nobody is looking beyond what they hope/want to see.  If you expand your search for X's and really account for all of them around the mountain, it is obvious that they are simply environmental textures for the rocks and terrain...mirrored, enlarged, shrunk, rotated, rinse, repeat.  Sorry...I just can't jump on board with this X on the mountain thing.  There are significantly more indications that they are nothing, than there are pointing to them being something.    I haven't seen anything yet to persuade me to search and document these X's.  The fact that they are found in so many places and in abundance should have been discovered early on...but it seems impulse and emotion won, over logic and thorough investigations, yet again."

chiliadmystery,3cvumu,gazzy82,3,Sat Jul 11 06:41:26 2015 UTC,Someone needs to make a picture with all the 'X's marked.
chiliadmystery,3cvumu,qbrainn,3,Sat Jul 11 06:11:53 2015 UTC,"Okay. So I almost never contribute here, just check in from time to time, but seeing all of this actually got me thinking.   Judging by the positions of the X's on the physical map in another post, and assuming superimposing the mural facing north, My crackpot theory is that those X's are markers for places on the mural and there may actually be 8 (maybe 9). That is, of course, including the boxes for the jetpack, egg, and ufo.   I say this, because the lineup on the map doesn't match the mural X's alone. As a rough estimate, the four found so far line up with the leftmost X, the ufo, the X above the Egg (not the egg itself), and the X above that.   The only one that doesn't fit perfectly is the fourth, which I can assume because the person who created that post was using push pins, a physical map, and approximation based on the ingame map. No offense to them, though. So the exact locations may line up.   Here's the thing. I don't know what comes next. The X's that match with X boxes could be important. They could be there to justify the position of the X's marking the ufo, egg, and jetpack, and then leading to where the ufo is placed at the top (the potential 9th X). This could be the important place. It's still on the mountain, and the three at the bottom could be where certain things must be triggered for something to happen there, or vice versa.   I'm starting to ramble, but it's what occurred to me after seeing what's been found recently. I can't really check it out myself, but I wanted to get the thought out there for those who can."
chiliadmystery,3cvumu,DevIsaac,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:58:38 2015 UTC,Solid idea bro! Yeah I'm still working on figuring out which X's are legit. Once we map them all out we can do an overlay.

Right now in terms of things relevant to the mural this is probably the best way to go based on the fact that since the game came out (in spite of all the ridiculous theories) the only things that have been found are the ufos (which are not actually ufos because we have ""identified"" them as in game government owned tech)."

There is even some huge wall of rocks (dont remember wich mountain) wheres many x´s very big all over it , so i tend to say its just a scratched texture to make rocks /mountains look more realistic when viewed from far away."

chiliadmystery,3cvumu,GiantSquidd,2,Sat Jul 11 06:03:31 2015 UTC,"I can check on my ps3 tomorrow If these X's are there ,  it hasn't been updated in forever, I have basically no Internet lol, Ill try to remember to post results, on a side note, I hope they aren't there, that would mean they just dropped a big clue for us"
chiliadmystery,3cvumu,Dinger2013,2,Sat Jul 11 06:11:48 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure there's been Xs found before, but most people put it down to Jesus toast. Some of these posted recently do look kinda relevant though."
chiliadmystery,3cvumu,GiantSquidd,2,Sat Jul 11 09:32:34 2015 UTC,What does it look like on the game map when marking the X's found? Any where close to the arrangement on the mural?
chiliadmystery,3cvumu,Dinger2013,2,Sat Jul 11 06:25:07 2015 UTC,"Not many people have actually looked for the glyphs, they just accept what is posted online. So there is a high chance that people missed these as they have never actually looked at chilliad... I have searched for the glyphs, and even with help online, they are very hard to find. I would not be surprised if these 'X' have been around all along, and we have more than 5.   Would be interesting if we only find 5, but chances are the mural X's are glyph locations and not these cracks in the rocks."
chiliadmystery,3cvumu,nemprime,3,Sat Jul 11 09:22:28 2015 UTC,"Especially considering that these ""x's"" are all over the map, not just on Chiliad. Once again, the sub is obsessing over Jesus toast."
chiliadmystery,3cvumu,Walnut156,0,Sat Jul 11 14:03:10 2015 UTC,This is the most combined effort of people looking to figure something out that I've seen in the longest time on this sub. Why try and sabotage the motivation? Maybe the answer could be something as simple as this and some people are jealous that they never tried it.  What is the current therory for the answer of the mystery from the elitist or have you guys just given up?
chiliadmystery,3cvumu,Bipolaricecap,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:51:10 2015 UTC,"There's no need to be butthurt when someone is skeptical of the claims being made. As I said, I'm happy everyone is excited, but I'd like someone to explain to me where we go from here. If I said that I saw Bigfoot, it would be up to me to prove it. You guys are claiming this is a big step, I'm asking for proof and an explanation...   Calling me elitist is pretty ignorant, bud. Im trying to weed out bad theories, that's the whole deal with skepticism, which is a fundamental part of understanding things.   This isn't my investigation, I think it's bunk. I mean that with no personal offence to anyone, it's the idea that I'm trying to break, because if it doesn't break, it's good. I really shouldn't have to be explaining this, you should just know this. If we just assume everything anyone says is true, we'll never make any progress because we already have more than enough clues that we don't know what to do with, and while the glyphs are able to give us much cryptic information, the only thing I could think of for these alleged x's are location, and no one seems to want to answer my question about what they think they mean."
chiliadmystery,3cvumu,highlyilluminated,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:01:51 2015 UTC,"I think they're putting the Xs together now that some have been found. Give it some time for an explanation. If it's found out that there isn't an explanation then it will be debunked. You can't just say it's debunked without trying anything.  Nobody has answered my question about why the Jetpack man being on the mural either, but I'm not being butthurt and trying to rush people into explaining it."
chiliadmystery,3cvumu,thiefx,-1,Sat Jul 11 16:30:37 2015 UTC,"You're missing my point. I'm not saying it's debunked, I'm saying I'm not convinced it's anything, but if it is let's hear some hypotheses of what this could mean. I hope someone can offer a good theory but as of yet all this is is everyone getting excited but no one really knows why or what to make of this potential find.  If these x's are legit what should we do? Try standing on them at specific times and weather, getting the protags to visit at the same time, etc... Everything I write shouldn't be read with a negative tone, my skepticism is actually positive as far as attaining tangible results in this hunt. I'm spitballing too.  Believe me, I want to solve this thing as much as anyone here, I'm just not going to start celebrating before we know what we're celebrating about. Hell, I wouldn't still be devoting my free time to modding this subreddit if I didn't love the mystery and many of you crazy fuckers!"
chiliadmystery,3cvumu,moistboyz,0,Sat Jul 11 16:44:38 2015 UTC,Touché. I'm actually still waiting for the price to come down for the xbox one version before I can investigate anything. All I can think of right now though is that maybe the lines on the mural that connect the Xs are paths to walk.
chiliadmystery,3cvumu,Rufnacous,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:00:50 2015 UTC,Are these new? Seems strange we're finding them right after an update

chiliadmystery,3cvumu,crustpunker,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:59:07 2015 UTC,"We have 5 glyphs on the mountain which are clear to see (when you are in front of them) yet we still haven't fully established what they all really mean. I don't think these x's are of any significance imho, and even if they do end up lining up with mural overlay, what exactly do we do with them? Plus, everyone talks about the x's on the mural, other than the mural itself what else do we have to tell us that they are actually x's? cuz 2 of them don't look like x's. If you're thinking about x's when looking at the mural then you'll more than likely see x's, but 4 of them do look a little like satellite dishes."

chiliadmystery,3cv9qv,mickeymouse4348,2,Sat Jul 11 02:02:20 2015 UTC,"Using this X and the third X, that would mean that the UFO is in the water, the Egg is at Paleto Bay, and the Jetpack is the altruist camp? Just a theory I could easily be wrong"
chiliadmystery,3cv9qv,tpettineo,2,Sat Jul 11 02:06:05 2015 UTC,"I think this is a starting place. Sounds very plausible, even more when you take into account that we haven't really discovered all the secrets about the altruist camp. Plus, the altruist camp has the eye/sun all over their buildings, so it definitely is related in a way."
chiliadmystery,3cv9qv,MrMrMilhouse,2,Sat Jul 11 02:10:07 2015 UTC,"from each X draw a straight line that goes directly in between the other 2 Xs and find the middle point, and see whats there  i am away from my xbox ATM so i cant do this myself, but there may be something at the point where all the lines meet"

chiliadmystery,3cuzmo,switchery,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:33:51 2015 UTC,Ahh ok cool. I just suggested to him that you guys invert colors to possibly make things stand out a little more. I also suggested online so you could focus on flying while your buddy spots with the buzzard camera.
chiliadmystery,3cuzmo,head_bussin,5,Sat Jul 11 01:35:18 2015 UTC,How have we not found these before? This is a great discovery.

chiliadmystery,3cv6aj,MrMrMilhouse,4,Sat Jul 11 01:20:11 2015 UTC,Have these been thrown in via the update? I would've thought Chiliad would've been scoured by now.
chiliadmystery,3cv6aj,Jakeab89,7,Sat Jul 11 01:41:30 2015 UTC,I always thought we as a sub were overthinking the mural but the progress we are making right now is remarkable
chiliadmystery,3cv6aj,Bob_Frasier,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:12:09 2015 UTC,That's very possible there are several different methods we could try once all of this is sorted out.

I found another X at the same height on the exact opposite position on the mountain. It looks to me like we found the top two X's on the mural ( the ones that are right next to each other). Can anyone help look for the corresponding X's? Thanks! This is exciting"

chiliadmystery,3cv6aj,TheEvilGerman,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:15:00 2015 UTC,The 2 x's found are the ones on top of the mural? Only thing I could suggest would be to invert colors. The X's might stand out a lil more as well as any lines leading to said X's. If any are there. Maybe check in online and have a buddy with you that way you could focus on flying while he uses the buzzard camera to search.

chiliadmystery,3cv6aj,XxSCRAPOxX,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:20:37 2015 UTC,Yeah sure! I'm sure the markings are still on the mountain regardless of 100%. Fly a helicopter around the mountain and see if you can find any X's. Try to use the mural as a guide to where they would be placed.
chiliadmystery,3cv6aj,Sparramadux,2,Sat Jul 11 01:23:06 2015 UTC,Why don't you put each character on one of the x's and see if anything happens

chiliadmystery,3cvdj4,DunderMifflinSabre,4,Sat Jul 11 02:22:04 2015 UTC,I'd say this is an X
chiliadmystery,3cvdj4,autistic4yearold,4,Sat Jul 11 02:49:22 2015 UTC,I would say you're correct. Which would mean my X would be the middle one on the right side of the mural and this X on the bottom of the right side

So we go to the hippie camp and find beam me up and much more alien/ufo clues. So we fly up and find the ufo, the ufo and the jetpack stickman is connected under the egg, so we go to the millitary base, find the lights on the bunker, fly up and find the second ufo.. The egg on the mural i think is just to show that here is an easter egg to solve.. And i think the lines and the X's is the way to connect everything and get things to happen.

chiliadmystery,3cvksh,reoze,2,Sat Jul 11 15:08:37 2015 UTC,"https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1d9c4ff225b936f6f5e1  There's the entire script, the only thing I did was name some of the anonymous functions and remove the extraneous 180 case statements that are unused completely in the ufo script.  Check_torso is nowhere to be found at all...In fact the only location that even sounds similar to what you're talking about is func_4. This function does not even relate to this mystery, it's a function reused in almost all of the scripts to load different props and interiors from an ID. That ID doesn't change, and it's passed in blatently at ""149"" which is ufo_eye. Nothing else is going to come out of that function"
chiliadmystery,3cvksh,reoze,3,Sat Jul 11 19:05:32 2015 UTC,"[The search for how to unlock ""UFO"" instead of ""UFO_EYE""] this is the link I was referencing the check_torso.  ""Update 1: In looking at the code, right before the resource ""UFO"" is loaded, the following resource (160) is loaded: case 160:     strcpy(""TORSO_P2_24_6"", &num5, 16);     num9 = 24;     num10 = 6;     num4 = 28;     break; Not quite sure what the ""TORSO"" resources are, but do they have to do with the character model when in the interior of a vehicle?  Update 2: Looks like more resources are loaded. Here are all the resources loaded right before ""UFO"": TORSO_P1_17_0 TORSO_P0_24_9 TORSO_P2_24_6 PROPS_P1_EA1_3 TORSO_P1_17_0  progress_tshirt v_franklinshouse (at the coordinates X: 7.0256f, Y: 537.3075f, Z: 175.0281f)""  It was my mistake to say CHECK_TORSO. I mixed up torso_p1 and the rest by figuring the game checks it. That is my interpretation on check ing torso. I don't read script files or any of that. I was just asking a question based on speculation and EVIDENCE each character can get the impotent rage tattoo.   The tattoo itself is odd, to be the single tattoo each can share? Like a brotherhood? I don't know but I put 2 & 2 together and figured this is what it meant. As for other people posting on Check_Torso, they may have got it from the same link I found"
chiliadmystery,3cvksh,SDStormtrooper,2,Sat Jul 11 20:14:22 2015 UTC,"None of those resources are ever loaded by the UFO script. It's a simple switch statement and the case being passed in is 149, not 160.  I can tell you exactly what the ""ufo_eye"" is, and what it is not. What it is, is the UFO that you are seeing on top of chiliad, it is designed as an interior with the center of it being the top of the mountain. This is why it fades away when you start walking off the pedestal. The UFO is simply a prop that is offset from the ""eye"" which is the top of the mountain. We've all ""unlocked"" it as part of achieving 100% and seeing the UFO on top of the mountain.  One of my test scripts for my script compiler was a rewrite of the UFO script without the 100%, time, and weather checks. I can guarantee this information is 100% correct.  What it is not: Anything new, anything we haven't seen before 2 years ago.  Edit: I'll even elaborate a bit more. The ""checks"" that everyone seems to be trying to figure out, that poke and prod random globals. These globals store state information about the world and how to treat that world. These are simply telling the game how to load the extra props, not changing what they load at all."

Because I was playing the game when the OP made this post, so I just went there to check the place for myself (based on the minimap of the original image) and when I get there I took a screenshot of the location :)"

chiliadmystery,3crajq,Dentured_Ocelot,2,Fri Jul 10 09:22:50 2015 UTC,Kifflom!!! Been looking for this for awhile.
chiliadmystery,3crajq,mickyh85,2,Fri Jul 10 05:23:55 2015 UTC,Grapeseed is the far most left area / town on the lookout platform board between the two telescopes on top of Mount Chiliad. Really hard to read it but with a scope you can zoom down and make it out. Not sure if helps but could unlock another idea for someone else.
chiliadmystery,3crajq,diegooo1972,2,Fri Jul 10 07:13:55 2015 UTC,It's hte location where Michael look for alien parts. Up there is a tricky path to the top of mount Chiliad. But going down to grapeseed from top of the mountain is not that tricky. I traied to go to this new hot spot 3 am raining but found nothin. I'll try to look for other connections. Also as you all probably did found nothing interesting around this spot atm. Now it's time to work.
chiliadmystery,3crajq,gazzy82,2,Fri Jul 10 08:18:23 2015 UTC,So what did you discover? Map location for the house and billboard?

chiliadmystery,3crajq,head_bussin,2,Fri Jul 10 22:06:41 2015 UTC,great detective work fellas. it's always fun when you can connect the dots in this game.   garde ta foy!
chiliadmystery,3crajq,KillaPam,2,Fri Jul 10 21:21:29 2015 UTC,Can we try and find the building associated with the Satellite dish billboard in Paleto Bay across from the Egg clock and also in Sandy Shores. I find it odd the store is advertised but has no physical counter part in game. A Satellite dish store to me should have a building in game and the fact it doesn't seems odd to me.   Considering the satellite dishes found in key locations around the game. Especially the Zancudo Light that shines on the Badger Dish.
chiliadmystery,3crajq,Milnah23,2,Tue Jul 14 07:07:04 2015 UTC,True. I'll keep my eye out for that building also.

chiliadmystery,3crc5k,Dentured_Ocelot,2,Fri Jul 10 04:12:23 2015 UTC,"I've tried seeing if these numbers correspond to letters in any way.  The 0 would make it difficult for that to be the case, but when keeping in mind the ""segregate and rearrange,"" the only place the 0 could be used is after the 2 (20=T), but EICT (5, 9, 20, 3) is the closest I've come to a set of four letters that can be rearranged into an actual word.  Maybe all the gas stations combined will have letters that can be rearranged into a clue?"

I am compiling a series of photos taken to support my theory, but:  https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/wiki/mazebank  The Maze bank, in my opinion, has something to do with the puzzle. I came to this conclusion after reading this forum and making several in game observations.    Maze bank reffered to as an Obelisk. In Franklin's Aunt's house at the beginning of the game, you can find Salvador Dali paintings (he used obelisks a lot). There is also a miniature Obelisk on the table, and the picture directly behind it shows a dove (appears to be landing on the Obelisk). Sinners passage mural with three lightning bolts pointing up at maze bank. Notice the '1' in the '17' on top of the bank seems to point towards Mt Chiliad.  Dom's lines in the mission on top of the bank: ""You feel that? Lightning bolt! Zap!"", ""Man, I know how it feels to ride an ATV out of a damn airplane.""   I think the Spacedocker, with the + and - symbols, needs electrically charged by lightning to fully power up. The Maze bank is the highest building in the game. Um, someone try using the Cargobob to carry the spacedocker on top of Maze bank during the lightning storm? Perhaps after summoning the UFO at 3am with another character? This would actually be a bit difficult to set up for, time, and execute.   I know, we are all crazy."

The random looking circles look just like crop circles, and this was deduced ages ago. I don't think anyone's cracked anything, but it looks to me like instead of it being a cypher there might be some meanings behind the symbols like there are with hieroglyphs. It probably just says 'Beam me up' in crop circle!"
chiliadmystery,3cnuh2,willdabeast,3,Thu Jul 9 12:08:36 2015 UTC,When i saw the circles it reminded me of the Golden Record that is on the Voyager spacecrafts. The two circles at the bottom right look similar to the glyphs and have something to do with atoms.

chiliadmystery,3cmzl7,tryfuhl,4,Thu Jul 9 05:23:40 2015 UTC,"I tried searching for the posts about it but can't find anything. There's a string of code in the game that checks the player and the surroundings to activate the UFO; 100%, health status, rain, etc. but there's another thing it checks and its the 'torso', we're not fully sure what this means so OP is suggesting it may be checking for tattoos. Others think it may have to do with clothing, hence all the tests with Michael in his epsilon robes.

chiliadmystery,3cm0dy,JesseThaBest,5,Thu Jul 9 09:31:20 2015 UTC,"Hello, I have recently discovered too of the spider webs within the realms of Mount Chiliad. The picture shows the two webs that are found between 1:00-2:00 AM in game time. The web in the top left corner can be found under the metal deck where the cable car stops on the top of Chiliad. The other web is much more interesting it can be found also under a bridge near Procopio Beach but the interesting thing about its location is a few yards away from the web you are not in Chiliad you are in Procopio Beach but once you step toward the web you are then in Chiliad. I don't know exactly what the purpose of these webs are but they really interest me. As you can see they sort of look like something you would but at a Halloween store. Considering that there both within Chiliads range there are bound to be more. I also found that the Tattoo artists name is spider and in his shop there are several different spider web pictures on his wall. He may have something to do with these web's. Now another idea I have is maybe you have to visit all of these webs in a consecutive game time without dying. Now as far as characters go I believe this has to be done with Trevor. Why? Because he is the only character that starts off with tattoos on his body referencing back to the artists name spider that connects to the spider web's. I however don't have the game at a %100 save file but I do have a friend who does. If there are any theories that you want to be tested I'll see what I can do feel free to try this one out. Thanks for your time. Also if any other spider webs are found it would be very appreciated if you could let me know where they are."

Theres a mission called Reuniting the Families, its the one where you drive through the Sprunk sign. Anyway, Big Smoke is driving and CJ is hanging out of the roof shooting cops.  Big Smoke drives through a car wash, and says to CJ, I like things clean.  In GTA4, Michelle says this same sentence to Niko when they meet for the first date.  Same SA mission, theres a cut scene of 2 cops on bikes, all you can see is bike wheels and feet. They drop donuts and say, What a waste of good donuts. In GTA5, Mikey and Trevor do something very similar when chasing the speeders along the Hwy while they are trying to steal cars for Devin Weston.  In SA, CJ says to other drivers, Are you a professional moron, or just a gifted amateur?? In GTA5, Mikey says to Lester when preparing for the Vangelico heist, hes talking about Franklin. He says, Hes either a professional, or a gifted amateur about to go pro.  I know these have nothing to do with anything mystery related.

There are also strings found in the past implying there being more than meets the eye.  Whether it's in-game, upcoming or cancelled, I definitely think more was intended than what we've solved thus far.  That said, I disagree with:   this sub had gone through a long period of dullness and badly needed fresh theories.   While nothing major has turned up, we've had the odd interesting thread over the last year or so, and learned more about some of the game files and how they work.  We're certainly not short of fresh theories either, with crazy (and sometimes sensible) theories being thrown all over the place.  Ultimately it's unfortunately slow going. It could well be that if there is something in the game that is accessible already, that it's some obscure easter egg similar to the ones hidden in other games that have taken years to find.

The hippy camp isn't marked on the map because in mapping terms, it isn't actually a thing, its not an official township or location, for example, their is a traveler community that has established itself near where I used to live, this isnt marked on a map etc because it officially isnt actually a township or location.  the not on the map thing can also be said for the merryweather port, any building in the city, the weed farm.

I don't remember where I heard this, maybe an interview about a battlefield game, but that's the reason why, in many games, when using an elevator movement is disabled. From the top of my head, that'd be like in the GTA5 storyline mission where you have to kill the architect in the unfinished building. Movement is disabled while moving upwards in an elevator. I think Bioshock did this in their last game too.  I think it has something to do with it being easier to just have 2 sets of physics for users, (running physics and ragdoll) rather than an entire comprehensive physics engine just so people can stand on cars while moving.  So if anything, its easier to make a simple if statement like:  if (player.position == railcar.position){     function.stoprailcar();     function.addwantedlevel(2);}   I'd assume the wanted level is to try and keep people from doing it."

I guess their ""substantial additions"" is just being able to turn your character into a chicken and a few weapons & vehicles.

Both were substantial additions, so not surprising that it's been this long with Single Player DLC #1 considering all that has been released on the GTA Online side."
chiliadmystery,3cet7r,iAmSmokey,6,Wed Jul 8 05:27:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, if there was actually a jetpack, it would have been found. From september 2013 to now, people tried to resolve the ""mystery"", but even with the pc version, nothing more was found on the files. I'ts more than obvious that if such a thing like the jetpack exist, it should come in a future DLC. The SP DLC logically."
chiliadmystery,3cet7r,IAmCross,2,Tue Jul 7 11:24:05 2015 UTC,"Good theory but this consensus has been around for a looong time, my only issue with what you stated is:   R* is keeping tabs on all of this, and that this isn't the type of company that'll just let this go on for nothing.   Why wouldnt they? Even if its just for the sole purpose of keeping players ""playing"" the game. R* is a company, companys are all about the statistics, its so they can claim that people played GTA V more than they actually did, just like they claimed that GTA V cost more to make than it actually did.  IIRC 150m of the 250m budget was used for marketing, just marketing, could you imagine what GTA V could have been if they only used 50m for marketing?  Imagine this or this, instead of this and this...  But then again im one of the very few people that was majorly disappointed by GTA V, sure its pretty damn good, but it has so many issues that just dont need to be issues. (half-arsed vehicle customization, weapon customization, missing settings for joysticks and wheels, just to name a few...)"
chiliadmystery,3cet7r,toeknee1,2,Wed Jul 8 08:49:43 2015 UTC,"That first 'this' looked awesome. That would've been amazing to play. And I completely agree with you with the issues pointed out. While I don't know enough about game development, I would however imagine that for a game to include san fierro and las venturas at the same or near same level of detail as los santos, and to keep them similar in size, they would have to sacrafice other things. correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't gta v pushing the 360 and ps3 to their limits, especially if they were planning on all of this dlc that they've released.   I'm sure you're budget numbers are right (or close enough), but i'd look at from a business perspective. Some game engineers/designers figured they could develop a game that would push the current gens to near limit with $100 mil. Separately, the marketing division at R* figured that the $150 mil mark or so is the optimal amount of advertising where they get the highest return (or most sales) per marketing dollar spent. If spending $300 mil would have more than doubled their sales, they would've done it. If only spending $50 mil meant that they would've sold only half as many copies, they would've done that. The two numbers are much more isolated than the way in which you portray them... Don't get me wrong though, I'd much rather play the game you described. I would've paid an extra $10-20 too for it.   As far as R* watching and not reacting, I think at the end it comes down to customer relations. Does that mean we will absolutely get a jetpack, no. But I think enough people bought the game after hearing that R* repeatedly say that the DLC will be free this time around. While GTA online was known and it was understood that free DLC meant that some of that DLC is going to be the ability to buy stuff in GTA Online, I'd imagine again that many GTA fans also figured, and R* implied, that free DLC would include major single player updates like Lost and Damned and TBoGT in GTA IV. While mums been the word from R* for a while, if they are going to release a major DLC again, how hard is really going to be for them to throw in/release the jetpack? why not?"

They've already said the main characters don't cross over console generations. Niko is referenced in GTAV but his story has finished. Johnny from The Lost is actually in GTAV but that's it. There isn't a CJ, there isn't a Tommy Vercetti, Lester and Omega's similarities are just nods back to those iconic characters of games gone by. Also, The Truth is Omega? Are you for real? The Truth was about 75 in San Andreas and Omega is in his thirties. So you're suggesting he hid the jetpack, reversed his age 40 years and changed his name just so he can get abducted, lose 50 spaceship parts and have some optimistic gangster retrieve them all for him? Yes, any answer to the mystery probably is in DLC, but to even suggest that all the old characters are going to resurface for a big raid on an army base is the ramblings of a mad man."

chiliadmystery,3cax3m,deltaninethc420,0,Tue Jul 7 17:39:55 2015 UTC,"One glyph solved? Thats been solved its showing us we need rain jyst like chilisd ufo. Ive been trying to get people to see the other glyphs that are directly related to the Eclipse, im not sure why everyone is stuck on the rain glyph as an eclipse.  The rain is telling us we need rain but The shadows at observatory made by the obelisk moon dials create eyes 1 tells time the other shows an eclipse. The eclipse shadow is obstructed by the ppodium the moon dial sits on (they made this dial into a 2nd moon dial it should be a sun dial based on real life, so rockstar changed it? Why?) That shadow looks identical to the faded eye glyph. So the faded eye tells us we need an eclipse! The rain eye confirms we need rain and maybe all eye glyphs show an eclipse but its the faded eye with no condition underneath that is directly showing us an eclipse!"
chiliadmystery,3cax3m,deltaninethc420,0,Tue Jul 7 16:14:27 2015 UTC,And that goes with the 2nd eye glyph there on the taller obelisk that shows time! And at a certain time the eye shadow if you could see shadows at night would land on the gold egg solstice plate on other side. This is the observatory grounds puzzle all solstice plates and planetary plates line up to form planet Uranus! Which again we see all over hippy camp. The eclipse this puzzle and the last eye glyphs atpre located here at observatory and they are all related.
chiliadmystery,3cax3m,deltaninethc420,0,Tue Jul 7 16:19:57 2015 UTC,https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/3cb3eu/the_shadow_eyes_as_the_glyphs_the_eclipse_and/  I started a thread yesterday...
chiliadmystery,3cax3m,lbraud,-1,Tue Jul 7 18:53:57 2015 UTC,I completely agree that the two obelisks and the lines on the ground mean something. But what does that have to do with this thread? Make a new post and let's discuss it there.
chiliadmystery,3cax3m,deltaninethc420,0,Tue Jul 7 17:51:38 2015 UTC,Because im pointing out that the obelisks create shadows those shadows are the other 2 glyphs. One shows time one shows eclipse so if were gonna sit here and talk about the glyph eyes representing eclipses ok but there is a faded eye glyph on chiliad and the only place that eye pic forms again is at observatory and if were gonna say an eclipse occurs than I think ots safe to say that faded eye glyph is solved its shows an eclipse! So it ties in directly to this thread we see eclipse and here is a glyph that represents an eclipse.
chiliadmystery,3cax3m,lbraud,0,Tue Jul 7 18:26:12 2015 UTC,"The glyphs mean different things to different people. Some people believe the mystery is already solved and therefore believe the glyphs just point to locations and weather conditions to see the UFOs. They would say the zig-zag glyph is just a hint to find the Ft. Z UFO with its green beam.  I think the glyphs are puzzles to solve before we get the prizes at the bottom of the mural. I think we need to solve the puzzle of the green light, elevator, and stealth UFO before we can say we've solved the zig-zag glyph.  Hippoplay, I, and I'm sure many others, have been going off the hypothesis that the eye glyph is an eclipse. Many of us have tried to get something to happen by getting the Moon to line up with the Sun without success. Based on this glyph, hippoplay tried it with rain. The result is the celestrial event you see in the videos. He had a theory based on evidence and it produced a result.   I am calling the event an eclipse because that is what I thought the eye could represent given the number of eclipse references in the game. Now it could be that there is another, bigger, celestrial event that looks like a traditional eclipse. But that does not at all take away from looking at this glyph and saying it represents the event that hippoplay found. Let me put it this way without using the word eclipse.  There is a glyph which contains an eye-shaped symbol and a rain cloud. When the moon crosses the sun's path in the rain, an eye is formed in the sky.  I'm sorry if it casts doubt on your pet theory, but for me it's pretty convincing that the rain glyph is solved."
chiliadmystery,3cax3m,deltaninethc420,0,Tue Jul 7 17:35:50 2015 UTC,"I get what your sayin on the glyphs and I agree but im tryin to point out that this faded eye glyph is seen at observatory and it represents an eclipse in general weather there is a condition under it or not....lets put it this way....the faded eye glyph is showing us that all ""eyes"" on the glyphs are an eclipse the conditions are located underneath..."
chiliadmystery,3cax3m,deltaninethc420,0,Tue Jul 7 18:29:24 2015 UTC,And i made a thread about it already. I linked it....the shadow shows us the same image as the faded glyph and the shadow points to an eclipse...we can solve the faded eye glyph as the glyph/shadow that shows us all eyes on glyphs are representing an eclipse we just need conditions...which are underneath....you said thats one glyph solved im saying this is another major glyph solved its in direct relation to this thread and to your comment.
chiliadmystery,3cax3m,Breet4ter,0,Tue Jul 7 18:36:59 2015 UTC,"I think the symbol above the mural is the eclipse (sun rays emanating from it) and the ufo is simply a mirage placed there to trick people into thinking that's what is on the mural. Again, it doesn't take physical shape because it's just a mirage with no significance other than misdirection by the creators."
chiliadmystery,3cax3m,teedoe,0,Wed Jul 8 18:21:31 2015 UTC,Have you tried it by standing on that glyph?
chiliadmystery,3cax3m,lbraud,0,Tue Jul 7 13:50:20 2015 UTC,I haven't. I think the glyph location at the hippy camp is just one of the conditions that has to be met (along with the moon glyph) before we can carry out what the hippy camp is describing.

How is that Franklin and Michael can slow down time? Why does your plane break apart when you fly too far south? Why does the Sun take the exact same path every day?   Because it's a game and the rules and physics are whatever the game designers decide. If a GTA V eclipse requires rain then that is what is required.

chiliadmystery,3cdg2l,diegooo1972,5,Tue Jul 7 20:04:27 2015 UTC,Because there are UFOs in the game and there's a UFO on the mural. There's a Jetpack on the mural so....  I might be the only one but I've never gone into the game files. I don't know anything about all that to be honest. I just play the game and know that there is a Mural that doesn't make any sense.

chiliadmystery,3cdpzo,DrSpoculus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:52:22 2015 UTC,"Trevor has no moral code at all. He is a Psycho, worse than Adolf Hitler even.  At least Hitler's intent, the thought of what he was doing was the greater good for everyone.  Trevor gets out of bed in the morning with the sole purpose of killing people, for no reason besides that he is crazy.  there is a difference. both are bad, but killing in the name of something like religion for example is better than killing just to kill.  Michael kills when he feel he is right or has been wronged.  Trevor kills because he want's to, no reason needed."
chiliadmystery,3cdpzo,toeknee1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:05:31 2015 UTC,"Trevor is a complete nutter. But he knows who he is, and doesn't try to deny it, he embraces his craziness.

Probably would be best if you just kept your questions simple. Don't think everyone appreciates being called redditards either. Most people probably stopped reading.

chiliadmystery,3cbh71,Erolution,3,Mon Jul 6 16:45:01 2015 UTC,"I like this post, also, doesn't killing michael or trevor have to do with this? Like killing michael helps the FIB and killing trevor helps IAA? maybe im mixed up, but maybe you have to kill a certain character to complete 1 side of the mystery. and maybe rockstar did it this way because most people would want to keep all players alive."
chiliadmystery,3cbh71,autistic4yearold,3,Mon Jul 6 21:01:57 2015 UTC,"Controversial but very very possible. Have a quick 5 second think - how many people would choose to permenantly kill off a main character in a game when they also had the choice to save all three?   Not many at all - it took me almost half an hour to make my choice because I didn't want to use the Internet on my first playthrough. Guns, vehicles, property - everything can be gotten over and over but there are only 3 characters.   The more.I read this post the more I like it - would ultimately add replay value to the game for the people that missed  it first or second time around and would give a legitimate reward to those people with the cahones to kill off a character e.g Aeris in FF7.   Keep all 3 = 3 different characters to enjoy at 100% Kill M or T = have 2 characters to enjoy at 100% with and either a jet pack or pilotable UFO to play around with."
chiliadmystery,3cbh71,Frostyjoc,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:28:51 2015 UTC,"this has been speculated before but I would think that which ever ending you chose there would need to have been some related decisions made throughout the story, lets say If you play the game mainly as Michael making choices relevant to him or that benefit him then it would make no sense to kill Michael off at the end I think the game would recognise this and thus you still wouldn't get any kind of reward.."
chiliadmystery,3cbh71,Squaremup,2,Tue Jul 7 11:38:14 2015 UTC,Yes that's kinda what I meant. For example my favorite character is T (cause it's T!) So throughout the story even though I kept all 3 I played mostly as T. Like you said you make choices that benefit that particular character and kill off the other. I just couldn't bring myself kill Michael off and leave myself with 2 characters :/ it's how I'm wired lol
chiliadmystery,3cbh71,Frostyjoc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:00:46 2015 UTC,"haha I know the feeling, I chose the safe option on ps3 but on ps4 I made a save and tried all 3 endings although I had just tried to play as organically as possible so it didn't really matter which one I picked but the other two endings didn't feel right at all, it affected my psyche report quite a bit too as far as I remember, which doesn't make much sense now after seeing the work another user did towards figuring out how its compiled. I took screen shots of the report with differences from the endings but this was a while ago now. There's just so much possibility, I need like a month off work to just sit and play the game properly while taking notes, I'm a shocking hunter I really am :("
chiliadmystery,3cbh71,Squaremup,2,Tue Jul 7 12:18:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know what you mean. I work shifts plus other life stuff so the time I get to actually hunt and work things out is a couple of hours a day so I could do with an 'employment gap' of a month to test out loads of theory's and whatnot.   I think the idea of killing off a character to get a prize is more logical the more you think about it though. Michael is the epsilonist, gets abducted by aliens, see's aliens when he is high, Is connected to the movie studio which has guys in alien suits walking around and they have a huge UFO there also. Also Trevor was in the air force, is connected to the altruists which have (may or may not) the jet pack looking symbol on the stone, possibly could use his ability whilst piloting the jet pack.    Just gets more and more likely the more I think about it."
chiliadmystery,3cbh71,Frostyjoc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:28:16 2015 UTC,"There's definitely some weight behind these ideas, I know the sub has flirted heavily with this set of connections in the past but there's so much to investigate and a lot of gaps which I can now only assume is due to some fundamental oversights within the story, things we've noticed but haven't realised the potential of. I'm firmly in the group that believes everything in this game is intentional, including subtle references like the jetpack shadow at the camp, it's very easy to ask the most popular question on this sub though; 'so what does this tell us?' Personally, I'm stumped but I think we've found most of the little eggs now, anything that's left has to be related to play through style / endgame choices / psyche report / timed events. I refuse to believe the hunt is over, imo it's just starting to gain some real traction with all the new users popping up."
chiliadmystery,3cbh71,Squaremup,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:02:07 2015 UTC,I'm really toying with the idea of starting a new playthrough simply to get 100% whilst killing off M at the end. Then testing the theories everyone is coming up with after choosing death wish.   Because I'm that kind of guy :)

Also, I just came to think of this, The T2 tower in Zancudo is enterable, T2 is FIB, FIB is the ones we work for in the majority of the story missions, The UFO's are FIB, the T2 door in the Chiliad tunnel is the one that is properly mapped, in other words, the one that makes proper metal sound when you kick it. What do we have on T1/IAA? In Humane Labs there is a spot you can land without attracting wanted level, but that's all that I can think of right now"
chiliadmystery,3cbh71,DreamingDjinn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:13:42 2015 UTC,"So, my thought based on the ""killing a character"" conversations:  Come back when your story is complete..  Easter Egg=the visable UFOS in game (no characters killed)  Kill Michael= Trevor/Frank gains access to jetpack  Kill Trevor= More interaction with UFOs as Michael/Frank?  Potential rewards based off whether or not you killed a character? That's the only thing that makes sense to me, and people are right: not enough exploration has been done involving the different game endings."

Everything we work off of in this game is consistent. We'll always have 100%, it'll always be 3am and raining when we see the Chiliad UFO.   But for our next step (including the Moon) will only happen at a specific time because the Moon is a ever changing variable in our hunt. We have a new Moon phase every night for 28 days.

chiliadmystery,3cb3eu,ManiaFarm,4,Mon Jul 6 18:22:58 2015 UTC,"I've been counting moons since 2012 2013, its 27. I'm fully aware of the flip. I made that image you posted. When I first made that image I thought it was 28 but I was wrong. its 27... I just deleted the chart to avoid confusion. Please edit the op to avoid misinformation."
chiliadmystery,3cb3eu,ManiaFarm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:27:35 2015 UTC,"Example is lesters calender in his house. The month is september and I'll assume 2013 is year when release was. Lester has the 17th circled and xed out,  which is the day of launch. He also has a square box around the date of the 19th, usually they put moon phases on calendars so looking up that date a moon phase is full and its called the harvest moon. So they are following a 28 day lunar cycle in game. Just as all astronomers and great philosophers did in ancient times, some even still do today. They studied the moon, sun, stars and time all based on 28 different phases of the moon in our solar system."
chiliadmystery,3cb3eu,diegooo1972,2,Mon Jul 6 18:33:42 2015 UTC,"yo, forget about the calendars. I sat there and watched the whole cycle multiple times. Its 27.   edit: If you don't believe me then sit there and watch it yourself. There are other posts that confirm this."

chiliadmystery,3cb3eu,Supakim1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:25:47 2015 UTC,"Lol I have! multiple times too! I'm not sure how just cause you been at it since 2012 has anything to do with it? Just cause you been at it longer your better than me? I been at it just as long and i got 28 every time the calendars was an example, Just another hint in the whole thing. Every time ive watched I count 28 days and 28 phases. How do you just take a day away?! Even you just told me you used to think the same thing but changed. So please tell/show me why you changed your mind dont just tell me im wrong with no explanation. I'd much rather have correct knowledge and lead people correctly than wrongly. Please show me where I went wrong so I can understand it, and not sit here n say oh well so n so said it was 27 so now I know theres 27 lol. I think it truly 28 because I seen 28 phases so please show me where I went wrong.  Heres another thing if your skipping the new moon flip as a phase then you should be skipping the full moon flip phase from wanning gibbious to waxing gibbious. Now you got 26 days and we're both wrong! How can you take away a phase of moon but not the other?! You dont see the full moon flip and still count it, you see the new moon flip but dont??? I dont get it! Please prove me wrong, I want the correct knowledge, I want to see what you see but im not understanding how your taking away 1 phase but not the other."
chiliadmystery,3cb3eu,ManiaFarm,2,Mon Jul 6 20:19:09 2015 UTC,"This is how I realized it.  If it were 28 days, a new moon flip on monday night would appear 28 days later on a monday night.  this is not the case. A new moon flip on a monday night will next appear on a sunday night/monday morning.  it was seeing monday on the phone that confused me since it flips at midnight, you remember monday night and see monday again so you assume its 28 days but its not monday night - monday night, its monday night - monday morning, 27 days.  edit: again using 7 day weeks to help you count you will see that its not 28 days or else moonphases would fall perfectly in line with days of the week. All new moons in your game would fall on a monday or whatever the day is. Just seeing new moons on different days of the week is proof that the cycle is not 28 or any multiple of 7. You have to remember that a moonphase encompasses one half of 2 different days of the week, sunday night -monday morning.  I'm not trying to flex any kind of seniority, its just that I made the same mistake you did and I don't want you to waste as much time as I did. I'm at fault for spreading the 28 day misconception and I want to correct it.  edit2: finally found the thread, https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/20usrb/moon_observations/  Does this quell your doubts?"
chiliadmystery,3cb3eu,hippoplay,2,Mon Jul 6 21:52:24 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected. When you first told me to change it I wasnt just gonna change with no explanation, I saw 28 having to count both flips new and full. But thanks im glad you made me see and understand.  The phases were just small piece to this post, even that guy in link you posted says hes not sure why the moon flips sides north to south every other time. This confused me for the longest time but I think I got it as I was saying above there is solstice plates which are seasons if there are only 2 seasons than that may just be a gta year! If im wrong on the year the solstice plates remain they are part of the grounds puzzle which creates planet Uranus! The shadow eye creates an eclipse showing an eclipse, planet uranus and a time most likely its going to be 1.54am"

But I will not change how I think by my own experiments based off 1 person telling me im wrong and not showing me why. And this goes with anything here on this sub, some people see or hear this or that some dont. Like the baseball bat at altruists being mr jetpack guy lol. Me personally dont think its there but others will argue it non stop lol but In the end theres only 1 way that is correct. That correct way must be proven until then its an educated guess. I see nothing here proving 28 days nor 27 days I just see mine and other peoples experiments and in what we see studying the moon. It's debatable pending on how you look at the ""flips"" in the phases. Either count the flips or dont count them. In the end there will be only 1 correct way but noone knows what the correct way is until something actually occurs."

chiliadmystery,3cb3eu,DrSpoculus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:09:29 2015 UTC,The 54 days are just a way of presenting my work i don't know yet what a year would represent in GTA V and also seasons. But i would like to stick to the fact that there are only 27 different phases for the moon not 28.
chiliadmystery,3cb3eu,FuckTheKarmaCops,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:12:07 2015 UTC,"Well either way I still think by you presenting it in this way showed us that there is a 'year' I never could figure out why the moon was doing what its doing by switching sides north and south every other full/new moon. But now it makes sense and to why there is also solstice plates on the ground. Its showing the summer and winter solstices! Pointing to a year system with seasons.  I count 28 days and this is why. 1 in real life the moon travels around earth in 28 days so to us thats what makes a month and calenders in game show us they still followed a month timeline and didnt change it. (new moon represents beginning of the month).  2nd there are 27 days that you can physically see a moon phase in game by the white disc of the moon, there is 28 but this cycle in game seems to be missing the actual new moon (A new moon is blacked out completely you would see no white) but the game doesnt show us a complete black moon (im assuming so we can still see the moon to follow it) instead it shows us a flip at midnight so the flip is a phase itself, its the new moon. Your counting 27 days because you see white as a waning cresent and immediately into a waxing cresent but your missing the day of the actual new moon.  I didn't make this but its a good reference this person has 29 images cause he shows the 1st pic again at the bottom."
chiliadmystery,3cb3eu,DrSpoculus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:29:20 2015 UTC,From the moment I saw it the cypher on the water towers has screamed moon phase and possibly eclipse to me. I didn't think eclipse was real in game. Looks like we have work to do boys.
chiliadmystery,3cb3eu,KillaPam,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:17:33 2015 UTC,"I think the eye at the top of the mural is not an eye at all but a clue to the solstice/ecplise, look at a solstice diagram and you'll see what  mean, I have thought this for some time now."

chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,rx7_mastr,2,Sun Jul 5 21:34:31 2015 UTC,"the first place i'd think of is the infinite fire area below the altruist camp. it says ""see the eye"" there."
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,stargateheaven,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:36:35 2015 UTC,Thats one of my concerns now. It lasts approx 20 ingame minutes but i think it is incomplete because it probably needs other conditions to become a real eclipse
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,JustCallMeJoker,3,Sun Jul 5 22:43:52 2015 UTC,"If this is real, I think this is absolutely a huge find. I think it might be related to the altruists or the cave found under the camp. Something that you might have to do or activate or just see the eye while you're there.   If someone else can try what he did and get the same result and record it, I think we definitely have a huge lead here."

chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,myinnertrevor,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:41:58 2015 UTC,"Sure buddy ! The sun is rising and is like going up and right. The moon is going left and down also at that time. What you see in orange is the overlay of the moon on the sun. By the end of the video, it is a little bit clearer that the sun is continuing up&right, leaving the moon behind. Do you see it ?"
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,username156,2,Sun Jul 5 22:42:35 2015 UTC,"Good find. Thanks for sharing. So you're saying this happened during a sunrise with any moon phase, and rain cheat. I'll give it a try."
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,ManiaFarm,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:03:45 2015 UTC,"Actually, you can see it with any moon phase but it depends on what lunar month (54 days) you're in. I mean that in each of these months you only have 2 eclipses, 1 on sunset and 1 on sunrise. The moon phase will be determined by that month. But if you advance time and go to another month then the moon phase will be different"
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,head_bussin,-9,Mon Jul 6 00:40:29 2015 UTC,Oh that's because there's no such thing as an eclipse in GTAV. It simply doesn't exist.
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,username156,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:03:48 2015 UTC,Proof?
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,head_bussin,3,Mon Jul 6 07:33:36 2015 UTC,why would you need a storm to see an eclipse?
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,Supakim1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:54:28 2015 UTC,the eclipse doesn't appear with a storm. Only if it is rain. Why i don't know. You are forced to cheat the rain you can have it by other means but it was simpler for me to just put the cheat for test purpose
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,ManiaFarm,0,Mon Jul 6 19:37:57 2015 UTC,"It's like the 'eye' people see in the sky all the time on here. People seem to look a what they're looking for, if that makes sense.  If we were looking for a secret puppy, there's be a puppy cloud. If we were looking for an eye, boom eye in the clouds."
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,head_bussin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:58:30 2015 UTC,"the sun does seem to give off an 'eye with a pupil' effect during dusk after a thunderstorm. nothing special outside of it happens, but it's a cool effect i guess and can be recreated.   seeing an 'eye' or ninja turtle face in the clouds is something totally different and as you put it most likely nonsense.   point being, if there is indeed an eclipse in the game, i'm sure it would be a lot more exciting than this and you wouldn't have to use a cheat to see it.   until i see the actual moon pass the sun i'm sticking with this being BS."
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,ManiaFarm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:26:56 2015 UTC,blabla
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,head_bussin,0,Mon Jul 6 19:02:00 2015 UTC,I never said this.
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,ManiaFarm,2,Mon Jul 6 17:58:38 2015 UTC,"the OP said it and you wanted proof this is phony, so i imagine it was implied?   not sure if you're just playing devils advocate here, but i posted in hippo's other thread, this is the 'eye of the storm' phenomenon.   i know we are grasping at straws lately and i would like to believe it's real but these videos are the sun briefly creeping out from behind the clouds followed by 'seeing the eye'."
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,head_bussin,0,Mon Jul 6 18:35:34 2015 UTC,videos are the sun briefly creeping out from behind the clouds   I don't think its that but the only one that can really say is hippo. What I'm saying is that an eclipse is possible in game. The sun moves in relation to the player. The moon has a complex enough cycle to place it in any position in the sky. combine these two facts and it becomes obvious that getting an eclipse is not impossible.
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,username156,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:38:37 2015 UTC,"i'm the guy that posted 'When One Becomes Two' by Dr. Ray Deangelo Harris ;)  username doesn't think they're possible, i don't know what to believe but i'm pretty sure this is not it."
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,ManiaFarm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:18:05 2015 UTC,well all you have to do is try out hippoplay's method and your confusion will be washed away.
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,head_bussin,2,Mon Jul 6 19:24:37 2015 UTC,"not sure why the onus is on myself and username to prove otherwise? this line of thought goes against every rule of etiquette i have observed from this sub since i subscribed. i don't even like username, but he/she is absolutely right.   isn't it up to the OP to show an eclipse with irrefutable evidence that would remove all doubt? unless i am blind, i do not see the moon in any of the videos he has posted thus far.   i think common sense needs to kick in at some point as well. why would the devs make the eclipse such a lackluster event and hide it behind thick clouds?"
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,Supakim1,0,Mon Jul 6 20:34:40 2015 UTC,You want me to prove a negative? Really?
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,head_bussin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:00:06 2015 UTC,So you just say things without any shred of evidence?  Here check this out. Username never brushed his teeth.   An eclipse is possible. You would know this if you spent anytime playing instead of being a keyboard warrior.
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,username156,-3,Mon Jul 6 17:45:02 2015 UTC,yeah. i'm calling bullshit on this.
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,Supakim1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:12:40 2015 UTC,Bullshit? how?
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,iAmSmokey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:57:47 2015 UTC,"well basically what username said. having to use a cheat code to see an ""eclipse"" pretty much debunks this no? plus there is no sign of the moon in either of those videos."
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,Shelbyturtle,0,Mon Jul 6 14:50:59 2015 UTC,"How what. That's not an eclipse. It's a lighting glitch. I guarantee if you moved 30 feet to your left or right, or forwards or backwards, it wouldn't look like that. And it doesn't even look like an eclipse anyway."
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,lbraud,2,Mon Jul 6 14:01:40 2015 UTC,"nope,, it looks the same all over the map dude.. go try it for yourself to see... then come bake here to start arguing !"
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,Ungreth,2,Mon Jul 6 19:07:15 2015 UTC,"Not sure if related but i once saw the moon and sun ""cross paths"".  i.e when the sun went down the moon showed up at the same spot where the sun went down (instead of, you know, the opposite direction...)  If proof is needed for some reason im fairly certain i can replicate it."
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,ManiaFarm,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:13:10 2015 UTC,"if you saw the moon on the sun's spot after it went down, you were probably 2 or 3 days early. On the day of the eclipse, when the sun is down, the moon as already advances in its path a little. I see exactly what you're talking about."

I waited for the perfect day where the moon will enter the sun's trajectory but nothin happend. Then i reloaded my save on that day and entered the rain cheat just before ""the impact"" and that's what happened."
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,teedoe,4,Sun Jul 5 18:04:28 2015 UTC,Looks like I'm gona be staring at the sun all week lol I've heard of eclipse in the game but yours is the only evidence I've ever seen. What was your perfect day and what moon phase did you have?
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,lbraud,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:54:44 2015 UTC,Well it depends how far in the game you are. You can see it with every moon phase but you'll have to wait much longer. If you can locate yourself on this calendar i can help you find it.
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,Supakim1,3,Sun Jul 5 22:46:15 2015 UTC,Can you explain that chart you linked? What do the numbers and letters represent? Sorry if I am being thick.
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,gbajere,6,Mon Jul 6 00:05:14 2015 UTC,"No problem sir. It is a lunar calendar i made to help me find the eclipse. The letters code for the day (in french) so that the green ""D"" is for sunday (i.e Dimanche in french). You have 27 different phases of the moon kind of facing south followed by 27 days facing north. These two make a lunar month of 54 days. In each month, you can see 1 eclipse at sunset and 1 at sunrise.  To be sure you need to check what month you're in by spoting the day of your new moon phase (most accurate phase to recognize).  For instance, if your new moon ""flip"" happens a thursday at midnight that means you're in the first month (J letter)"
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,gbajere,3,Mon Jul 6 00:45:31 2015 UTC,Good work
chiliadmystery,3c7mvz,teedoe,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:32:08 2015 UTC,Could you please add this wonderfull calendar to the wiki ? Many people believe moon is involved.

Long story short: marlowe vineyards. Look at the location on the map, then observe the Chiliad web. Very very similar. I noticed the shape by accident- I was skyfalling as T and thought to myself ""holy shit the vineyards look a lot like the web. I checked the map for the shape and the similarity blew me away. To further the oddness of this area, guess what vehicle circles the vineyard area multiple times: the infamous yellow cropduster. I thought of a fly circling a web type metaphor. I wasn't totally convinced at this point, so I searched around the area, which led me to the vineyard sign. The ""o"" in only one ""Marlowe"" on the main sign has a dot in the middle, and I immediately thought of eye symbolism. I suggest people check this out."
chiliadmystery,3c8u0h,Transexual_Panda,2,Mon Jul 6 09:10:33 2015 UTC,I like this! Ive seen that place and always wondered what it was shaped like that for - like why did the developers decide on that particular lay out? I think that may be a good area to search for the next web. Im going to get on now and have a search around :)   I also had a bit of a thought about paleto bay possibly having its own spider web but then i decided its maybe too close to the one found near the beach on the north side of the map - so what about maybe somewhere like the saw mill or around the clucking bell factory. The more obscure place the better i think.

chiliadmystery,3c8u1o,Jakeab89,2,Mon Jul 6 03:22:22 2015 UTC,"The Path. The Path from the UFO to the Jetpack on the Mural. There is the Our Path is Lit phrase, there is this Epsilon is The Path. The Zancudo UFO's beam of light shines right on top of the Bunker where most of us think the Jetpack is.   Physically in game in a sense the Zancudo UFO and it's beam are the line drawn on the Mural from the UFO to the Jetpack.   They put a lot of emphasis on this ""Path""."

I don't know if they've always been in those credits or if they were added with the Heist update.   My thought is if they were always there maybe Zimbor could be apart of DLC, idk if it's something we can trigger in game or apart of an upcoming DLC."

They look identical, both have 3 stubby legs and a glass top, and the hippie camp is not drawn on the map, so that would make it a Easter Egg. Picture the mural as a 3D image looking at Mount Chiliad from The Famous Hamburger sign, the glyph's and locations match up. The all seeing eye is under the platform, Old mans crack would be the line that connects it to the cracked egg (Cluck n Bell Factory) and the stick figure/jet pack is Fort Zancudo an Area 69 Easter egg and again another location that is not drawn on the map."

chiliadmystery,3c6gqq,diegooo1972,2,Sun Jul 5 07:51:59 2015 UTC,Why not try using the mural from the files with the LS map from the files?
chiliadmystery,3c6gqq,DRUMIINATOR,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:01:28 2015 UTC,Cause the eight is bigger then the snapmatic one for example. Overlaing in different positions on the maps place X in different locations. Assuming maps have the right proportions. And i wonder how normal console player could solve the mistery that way. In the mural from files the proportion of width and eight are different then snapmatic screen shot. Location end  in different places using snapmatic or mural from files.  At least we need to know which to use.
chiliadmystery,3c6gqq,XxSCRAPOxX,3,Sun Jul 5 14:28:57 2015 UTC,"I feel like it has to be solvable for last gen console. And while there may be clues hidden in higher res, it's not something that should make or break the mystery. Idk if the mural is meant to be an overlay. I think it's more of a map. But a map of triggers."
chiliadmystery,3c6gqq,Paximillian,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:52:23 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised that if, assuming the mural overlaying was part of the mystery, R* did intend for the file to be used. It's the most logical scale to use, as well as offers a cross-media interaction with the game. It's actually quite brilliant. That being said, I myself don't think the mural is an overlay problem."
chiliadmystery,3c6gqq,Paximillian,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:42:23 2015 UTC,I'd be very surprised instead. How could normal player without trick and programs could solve the mistery ?  A mistery only for gta hacking comunity ? Mmmm I really don't think so.
chiliadmystery,3c6gqq,XxSCRAPOxX,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:32:16 2015 UTC,"It's not really only for hackers to solve though, they only help provide one step. Remember all the theories about encryption and computer science related issues(Such as the Chiliad tunnel lights)? Are those intended for only security specialists and encryption enthusiaists? My point comes from the idea that the mystery could require more than one area of knowledge to solve, not necessarily general. Of course, there have been many findings in many areas and yet no actual results in any in a LONG time, so who knows. Just throwing it out there."
chiliadmystery,3c6gqq,XxSCRAPOxX,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:03:47 2015 UTC,I see but if the mural overlay somewhere one of 2 pics must be wrong. The snapmatic or the game file.

chiliadmystery,3c4u0k,iAmSmokey,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:07:37 2015 UTC,"not sure if relevant here, but sometimes, creating small blocks that handle stuff for you with code is actually quite handy when you code games.   For example: If you want give an object a radius, like ""if the player is in the proximity of this object"", and the object would be the cable car building, its easier to create a block and add the code with a radius to that, then to use the whole model. (pivot points, etc).   -Q"

chiliadmystery,3c1f5y,NemWan,4,Sat Jul 4 00:15:52 2015 UTC,That suggests deliberately changing the month/year after the fact to correspond with what the release date/present day setting of the game was supposed to be at the time the texture was finalized.

chiliadmystery,3c1f5y,NemWan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:36:42 2015 UTC,Not sure. In iCal that would indicate the current date. The days and dates of* the month match October 2012.

If the thumbnail one is correct, then that puts the weekend (Sat/Sun) as columns 3 and 4.. which seems odd too.

chiliadmystery,3c1f5y,NemWan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:56:56 2015 UTC,The day highlighted in gray would be the current day. Interestingly both the main and thumbnail calendar have day 2 selected even though the months don't match. The multicolored items would be color-coded groups of events and the colored days on the thumbnail calendar would merely indicate that there are events on that day.
chiliadmystery,3c1f5y,NemWan,3,Sat Jul 4 22:06:19 2015 UTC,"The screen is based on iCal in Mac OS X 10.6, which was current from 2009-2011.

I have also  been using another method to glitch into them. I believe that when you use the creation option and glitch into buildings, buildings which have interiors will allow you to get into them without falling and then skydiving till you respawn on the ground. If you do fall though, I think this means that they do not have interiors. I've tried on a few obvious locations which react differently to normal 'empty' buildings. Now I've been testing those small power buildings and I'm 97% sure they have interiors. I've tried both methods and this indicates to me that they do have  interiors. I hope this made sense, but I will explain if asked to."

At about 1 year into the hunt a player mentioned in his completed play through he kept hearing the player character cough like he was sick and npcs would cough while he walked past them. He said it gave him the feeling that he did something wrong or the game was telling him subliminally that there was an error or he took a wrong turn to a dead end like on the mural.  I have a new play through I started and I did the 2nd choice for the heist where you use the sub, I did the mission normal looking for hints or a reason that heist even exists. Sure enough after taking the sub out of the water with mike flying it makes franklin shoot a bunch of helicopters and before or after the event went down I heard Frank or M do a loud cough.

chiliadmystery,3bw3pm,nemprime,5,Thu Jul 2 18:26:20 2015 UTC,This happens cause when you zoom a new set of the coordinates is generated that moves with your zooming position.

chiliadmystery,3btnl4,Rocman4210,0,Fri Jul 3 03:24:19 2015 UTC,"The different dialogue steams from the facts that when you trigger multi character missions (the one's that have more than one protagonist in them, like the heists), sometimes you get slightly different cutscenes depending on which character you start the mission with. (For example, the fame or shame mission, if you start out as M, you see how M discovered Jimmy's weed, and got pissed, etc, but when you start as T, you jump to a little before T walks into the house, completely missing that entire scene where you see Michael finding his son's stash, but just from context, knowing M found some kush and is angry.) When you replay a mission, you can't choose, and you get a sort of a cutscene by default , and if that default one doesn't match how you originally triggered the mission, it will seem different, naturally. Sorry to burst your bubble, but also, bullet number 7 is very intriguing"

Like some others have said, these hacking trainers usually have a bunch of preset models ready to spawn, and your average griefer is usually too lazy to browse the (HUGE) directory of models to find any more beyond that. It's likely whoever created the tools simply didn't think to include the Zancudo UFO, therefore we never see it spawned."
chiliadmystery,3brdzc,iAmSmokey,-4,Thu Jul 2 20:41:02 2015 UTC,"Modders/Hackers   Are you trying to offend Modders?  EDIT: Do you have the model hash?  EDIT 2: Spawning via Model hash is possible, so if you had the hash i could probably spawn it."
chiliadmystery,3brdzc,XxZenJojoxX,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:26:58 2015 UTC,"I was in a lobby with a modder and asked him if it was possible to spawn in the FZ UFO, but he said he couldn't find it."
chiliadmystery,3brdzc,amoshydra,2,Thu Jul 2 03:20:10 2015 UTC,He didn't find it because most of the popular online mod menu contain a small number of object by default e.g. 10 items.   However those mod menu allows them to spawn anything if they know the name of the object.
chiliadmystery,3brdzc,Chatting_shit,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:25:46 2015 UTC,That is interesting. I read the other reply who said its not part of a spawning/hacker menu. Either way i want to know why isnt it spawned like the others frequency
chiliadmystery,3brdzc,AnEvilVet,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:42:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen anyone mention it yet here but i remember seeing someone mention recently that it was because the zancudo ufo is several models in one object.   With the hippy camp model it is possible to just take the existing texture and wrap it on, say, a helicopter. Im guessing multiple textures is a different story though."
chiliadmystery,3brdzc,AnEvilVet,0,Sun Jul 5 09:01:17 2015 UTC,"I believe the hippy camp and Zancudo UFO models are a physical part of and attached to the model of the island itself so can't be spawned online.   However, it's likely that the hackers can extract the Chiliad UFO model and make it solid online."
chiliadmystery,3brdzc,reoze,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:03:04 2015 UTC,"ok, yea that makes sense. I didnt say mt chiliad ufo model cuz i assumed it was more an image then a physical thing. The chiliad ufo doesnt have FIB on it (that we know of, right?) Now im just trying to remember if the UFOs i see hackers spawn have FIB on them or not. I think the driveable UFO mod that i saw used the FIB one."

chiliadmystery,3brdzc,chilleverest,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:04:32 2015 UTC,I guess its just a mater of asking someone who has been thru all the files. OR the guy who spawned it close to the ground so we could all get a look at it. hmm i wonder if i can find that old post and message OP
chiliadmystery,3brdzc,chilleverest,0,Thu Jul 2 14:44:06 2015 UTC,"Just popping in here to say that they wouldn't make it a physical part of the world. Models are all usually modeled and stored individually. The island itself is one big terrain, with millions of models placed on top of/inside of it. Whenever you see an object clipping that's inlaid in the ground it's usually just a model that's translated straight down, with modifications to the terrain or custom meshes for details (ie: a special crater around something, etc)"

chiliadmystery,3bryho,druther,3,Thu Jul 2 20:49:19 2015 UTC,"Seems legit. I think the reason we can't seem to do it yet is because it's not finished. Realistically the heists just came out, more dlc, I think it's not going to finish until we get all the dlc. This is not uncommon in the video game world. Why would they end it before the game is finished?   ""Come back when you're story is complete"""
chiliadmystery,3bryho,XxSCRAPOxX,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:07:44 2015 UTC,"I feel like that's what someone from Rockstar will say when the dlc that resolves all this.  ""Hey the observation deck does say Come Back When Your Story Is Complete.""   Certainly the statement is vague enough to be open to interpretation. I could see it as being their way of telling us it's all Dlc but they kind of quelled us by letting us onto the first pieces of the puzzle.   It would be amazing if all of this is a preamble to DLC. If we got an epic dlc I would be satisfied with the way Rockstar did things. It would be like we interacted and almost pieced together the Dlc ourselves.   I don't know what a UFO/jetpack dlc would mean for people without a 100% save. I would be a little mad if a 100% file doesn't make a difference as all we get in it is the viewing of the UFOs."
chiliadmystery,3bryho,KillaPam,2,Thu Jul 2 02:30:02 2015 UTC,"I was thinking they would add to the story at some point. Kind of like ballad of gay tony. It seems like this mystery is the most Intriguing part of the game once you've played through.  If it's solvable int he vanilla version then I think it matters how you finish the game and who with. But if it is, it seems like that would stop people from playing if it got solved. I think it's been held back. It seems like forever, but it's really not, stuff is still coming out, the PC and next gen versions are relatively new. But idk. I think the theory about time travel and the lightning bolts being power are spot on. The question is how."
chiliadmystery,3bryho,XxSCRAPOxX,3,Thu Jul 2 03:06:00 2015 UTC,I've just been looking at pics of the power station over at the GTAV wiki and can't for the life of me see how it's the shape of a jetpack. Could you post some pics and highlight what you're talking about?
chiliadmystery,3bryho,MonkeyMagicEden,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:32:54 2015 UTC,it's the humane labs that has a very large structure that looks similar to a jetpack.
chiliadmystery,3bryho,head_bussin,2,Thu Jul 2 09:31:25 2015 UTC,"just regarding you're last thought. You can sky dive right to the bunker door! Heli above the sewage plant next to zancudo, high above radar level. free fall right to outside the bunker."
chiliadmystery,3bryho,pelvis69,2,Thu Jul 2 01:19:07 2015 UTC,Great Scott!! Great Post!! I love the 88 mph time travel theories. Good connection to the Taylor station. I do believe Lighting is involved in some way to this mystery. Good Luck.
chiliadmystery,3bryho,myinnertrevor,2,Thu Jul 2 06:30:43 2015 UTC,It's crazy how much attention has been paid to the power systems in the game. The first day that I came upon this mystery and even before that really I thought that the power systems were very interesting. I spent a lot of time in Taylor Power Station especially observing the guards in the control room. I mean those were NPC's guarding something way out of the way. Always a little strange.
chiliadmystery,3bryho,tryfuhl,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:16:07 2015 UTC,I wonder if bulletproof tires would conduct current better than regular ones?  Isn't that the only upgrade you can buy for the space docker?

All the time triggers (spider webs / ufos etc) make me wonder if there's a certain place to be that might reveal a message or a clue when the sun shines and viewed from the right spot. I don't think rockstar intended this game to be such an educational tool but they've done a bloody good job of it!"
chiliadmystery,3bri0r,Squaremup,4,Wed Jul 1 16:12:40 2015 UTC,"Your comment reminded me about a small thing i found that i always brushed off but went back to recently, if you drive along the paleto bay highway heading north and if i remember correctly it wraps around at the top of the map and ion the north side of that road theres a sign on the highway riddled with bullets holes that when you stand in front of you can see through the holes, i always wondered if you had to stand there and look at it at a certain time of day or try to line the holes up with something"
chiliadmystery,3bri0r,socrates1975,2,Wed Jul 1 19:47:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is pretty interesting, there's also a sign in Paleto Bay that advertises the number one satellite dish store in San Andreas if I remember correctly.

chiliadmystery,3brzzx,youngame23,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:56:26 2015 UTC,"The search term you're looking for is Option A, B, or C. Most people focus on C but a few people have soft 100% A's & B's. There are no clues so far that I have seen or read about that suggest an A or B story finish.   That being said, what is your test suggestion?"
chiliadmystery,3brzzx,serovajoe,3,Wed Jul 1 19:46:08 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot more sense for search terms. My theory is since most people including myself have tried option C, maybe that is the obvious choice. Choosing option A or B could allow an alternate ending to the Altruist mission or epsilon missions , after %100  completion.   My original question is was this tested?  There are missions in this game not required for %100 and  the altruist acolyte mission isn't even in the guide for 57 random events. I've read lots of info here from ambient missions to full moon parties. Why have an option to kill either player? Second theory, mural related.  Option C = Franklin = Unlocks Egg/easter egg/ visible UFOs   Option B = Michael lives = UFO drawing = unlocks UFO  Option A = Trevor lives = jetpack drawing = unlocks jetpack  Maybe the option you choose changes an outcome to the ending of the Altruist/epsilon missions. Yes you can complete the missions before %100 but that might negate the ""puzzle"". I believe there are specific events that need to be done at certain times. Possibly certain victims taken or certain random robberies you keep the money.   Aside from this, has anyone heard Trevor speak ""nicely"" to NPCs? I bought GTA at launch and used Trevor doing many random events helping people. I could have sworn Trevor spoke nicely to NPCs before I started doing his missions. It could have been my mistake or possibly patched over. Kifflom!"
chiliadmystery,3brzzx,AnEvilVet,0,Wed Jul 1 22:14:24 2015 UTC,Why link Michael to the UFO and Trevor to the Jetpack? Why not the other way around?
chiliadmystery,3brzzx,Squaremup,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:42:37 2015 UTC,the most widely acknowledged reason is the obvious Michael / alien story mode content and trevors piloting backstory

chiliadmystery,3brzzx,AnEvilVet,0,Fri Jul 3 10:28:42 2015 UTC,You could say though that Trevors piloting background could link to the UFO as well. Not sure how you would link Michael to the rocket pack though.
chiliadmystery,3brzzx,Squaremup,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:57:33 2015 UTC,"I made a save before the final mission and tried each alternate ending, the one where everyone lives is the only one that feels right when the credits roll."
chiliadmystery,3brzzx,Squaremup,2,Thu Jul 2 14:21:07 2015 UTC,"One thing that I noticed is that most people choose option C and there hasn't been much to go off of. Choosing either A or B ""feels"" wrong since we lose a character but there is a hidden story in the dialogue. Each time I replay the game I notice new things.  Choosing option A or B doesn't give us anything significant (that we can tell) so why lose a character if we don't gain anything right away. I believe there is something hidden in the choice we make.  Is there a reason we should choose to kill a character? Is there a reason why certain missions, random events, and encounters are not required for %100? Certain choices to get %100?  To me, there is a hidden story that we need to pay attention to. Like how did Michael know Dave Norton and why was he helping Michael ""get out"" in the prologue?"
chiliadmystery,3brzzx,Squaremup,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:00:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a good point, it had occurred to me that each ending might be the correct conclusion for 3 certain play through styles and if you play through a certain style and pick the correct ending to resolve your story the prize will be revealed, either no ones done the correct combination of playthrough and choices or I'm barking up the wrong tree :)"

The black approaches the screen from the exterior in an ocular shape.   Check out the very first death on this ""1,000 ways to die"". Not only does he go underwater, but he died there too, with the ocular, black border.   Edit: personally, I don't think so; however, I'm not going to dissuade anyone from investigating this further.

I also followed that link to your last one about the wallpapers and the whole Ana kata thing and the part about being able to be male and female to access the other dimension or whatever interested me. I didn't notice until right after I got done with the main story but you're able to put on a dress if you are Trevor. I'm not sure if I was able to do that the whole time or if maybe that has something to do with this whole mystery. Just thought I would throw that out there. Maybe put on a dress and go to the mountain and get drunk and something will happen. Not sure but UFO abductees irl always seem to be Trevor like people that no one will believe. Just a thought. I have also noticed the screen looking like an eye when loading sometimes and I feel like that's on purpose too. I like your theory about us (the gamers) being the observers or gods. I've always assumed that those loading screens where you're above the clouds and stuff were representations of us as the aliens. Anyways I think the dress thing is worth a shot if rock star is going to go through all the trouble of the whole Ana kata thing. Anyways, great post, thank you."

chiliadmystery,3bodoy,Squaremup,-2,Wed Jul 1 11:26:03 2015 UTC,"It means there is another way to play the game and still get to the same end.(First mission, setting your goal upon you. Don't follow prompts because that's the old way. Follow your heart in GTA V)  You don't have to follow the paradigm and programming of the past.  You are on the correct path to change paradigms. You can't ""Complete"" a story by starting at the end, which is what all the hunters of past have done. Some tried to change, but they didn't see the way clearly enough, didn't realize the path was even broader and with less room for error than the one they took.  Rushing through the story without fully completing it and then ""Starting"" the hunt afterwards is like picking up a book and skipping to the last page to read the ending to gauge whether or not it's worth the effort of reading.  Play by the rules of the game set by the rule makers. It matters not whether you win or lose because that part is unchangeable. There are 3 endings, no more, but the story in between the Prologue and the Final Choice and how you play in that time frame are the factors in whether or not you receive your reward at the end.  IN PLAIN ENGLISH: Achieve the good marks on the psych report, choose with you heart in the end, and then do the Epsilon Missions."

Also not all of the mountain ranges are marked, only some. the location of the markers are also curious. I know what I'm checking tonight!"

I do not think this will solve the mystery but it may give us more background on what to be paying close attention to in story mode. Is it possible to look into coding for online?   About what is said in your post.  I have always thought Lester has something to do with the infinite 8 killer. Maybe the bodies WERE buried but when this man, you speak of, let it be known that he knows where they are, Lester had them dug up and thrown into the ocean. Maybe the man deemed the title The Infinite 8 Killer found the bodies and he made the ""infinite 8 mystery"". Lester, knowing what he has done, had him killed inside prison? The reason I want to see dialogue from online is to see if any of these speculations hold merit.  Very good find brother."

chiliadmystery,3blndu,SuperMaruoBrassiere,2,Tue Jun 30 18:41:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the thing is there's still unanswered questions. Take a look at the FAQ to see just how many."
chiliadmystery,3blndu,SuperMaruoBrassiere,2,Tue Jun 30 18:58:48 2015 UTC,"This Sub has decided the Altruist Camp is just the spawn location for a bat. That's it. Nothing more.   That's it? Actually I think the sub decided that the Altruist Camp is extremely suspicious. Weird buildings and NPCs, conspicuous graffiti everywhere, lots of weapons, a unique crate that only spawns once in the game, an odd jet that flies overhead... not to mention the bat.  Of course there are tons of other bat spawn locations in game, but this is the only location I can think of where a melee weapon (arguably) completes an image that looks like one of the Mural drawings.   it seems odd that a heavily armed camp of cultists would use such an inefficient means for dispatching a sacrifice.   I'm no expert on human sacrifice (none of us are... I hope) but in movies at least, ritual sacrifice is usually more physical than just shooting someone with a gun. Smashing someone in the head could be part of the ceremony. This is a murderous cannibal cult we're talking about...  I completely agree that it is strange, but I don't think it's accurate to say that we ever ""overlooked"" the Altruist Camp or that bat."
chiliadmystery,3blndu,SuperMaruoBrassiere,2,Tue Jun 30 19:47:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry, my wording was wrong. The Altruist Camp is especially significant. I was specifically referring to the Camp and Bat connection, nothing else.  And what with the sacrifice, I would expect a knife or something. A bat would require a whole lot more effort to actually kill something, even with massive trauma to the head."
chiliadmystery,3blndu,Jakeab89,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:23:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a knife might make more sense for a sacrifice ritual. But according to this GTA Wiki, the bat actually does more damage than the (original) knife:  http://gta.wikia.com/Weapons_in_GTA_V  It is weird that they put a bat on that rock, but the Altruists are pretty weird to begin with. I don't know what else we could try though. I'm sure I'm not the only one who's run around the camp, swinging the bat at every door and object in sight. What else can we do with it?  And if it was a knife instead of a bat on that rock, the shadow would look one-legged. They might have put the bat there just because of the way it looks."

(I know there's a machine gun sitting on the rock for Trevor to grab too.) Yeah, a baseball bat seems totally unnecessary there.  I remember thinking once that the arrangement of the altruist stone and seats vaguely (very very vaguely) resembled a baseball diamond, with the rock as ""home base"". It makes sense that American baby boomers would be into baseball...   I'm skeptical about the shadow too, but whether it was intentional or accidental, I do think it resembles the stick man on the mural.  Either way I totally agree that the Altruist Camp is a mysterious place."

And the point you make kinda saying ""theres a weapon, so altruistcamp /thatplace have to have a deeper meaning"" seems like huge bs to me, theres a lot of spawns for weapons in this game and in every other gta game and it never had any deeper meaning. Its simply for fun and for the first time you find it ,   it was supposed like this actually: You look at the blueprint map and see all those little notes and while you are free roaming you visit one of those spots, find a cool weapon you CANT just BUY so you are HAPPY with the weapon and just enjoy the weapon..

chiliadmystery,3bfw8t,Erolution,19,Sun Jun 28 21:33:02 2015 UTC,"I think this might be a good idea. today I realized there were 3 entrances to the military base, and one of them can be ""passed"" by jumping over the fence with the help of a small land slope (sorry, I'm french...). But getting past the fence triggers the alarm and the 4 stars.  Now, assuming you get to the elevator or whatever, you will still get those stars. I could evade the 4 star alarm by staying close to the bunker elevator, but as soon as you get your head out, these stars come back. So maybe you will trigger them eventually! I don't think you can go there without a wanted level.  I'd like to add something : Remember, everytime you get to call an elevator, it is already at the same level as you. this is the case when you get to clean the FIB HQ as Michael. the elevator opens up right away, meaning it is on your floor. The Bunker elevator is at -1. Right? So what if it is not actually an entrance, but an exit? I have spent 3 days searching for an eventual entrance like the one for Human Labs (underwater) and still at it. I'll let you know if anything comes up ;)."

chiliadmystery,3bfw8t,zephirion,2,Sun Jun 28 22:48:10 2015 UTC,My theory has always been the General near the control tower. Take him out using Stealth (most underutilized trait in game) to get the keycard.

Now, I still get the wanted level when I venture to far from this fire station or the trenches, and I did not find the ""general"". Instead, I stumbled on a different NPC, different from the soldiers. He shot at me with a handgun, no Assault Rifle. So I believe there are some particular NPCs after all.  I might want to keep an eye on the bunker entrance, in order to see if someone gets in or out at a given time, since you can easily see NPCs park their car and use their phone. I also saw a soldier using binoculars on top of a watch tower. Maybe this one can see us wherever we are and trigger the alarm on its own. Tried to shoot him down, gave me an instant 3 star level...  Now, I keep exploring the possibility of finding another entrance to the -1 level, considering the elevator would be an eventual exit. I'll keep in touch."

chiliadmystery,3bfw8t,Bipolaricecap,3,Mon Jun 29 22:29:18 2015 UTC,You are probably landed in the area where Trevor pass to reach the cargobob. All this are is safe until you go over the place where the cargobob is in the mission. I tried many times to find another safe zone starting from there without success. Possibly jumping with a fast car somewhere may help. Never tried that strangely.......  I think we have to draw those safe zones. For example you can land on the UFO bunker and walk on both side without alarm triggering. Or la in the radar tower. Bah i'll do it today so we can update with everybody findings.

chiliadmystery,3beyx4,DRUMIINATOR,2,Sun Jun 28 17:16:05 2015 UTC,I have absolutely no idea sir. Just take the cargobob and drop space docker in the alamo sea (just kidding). there is probably nothing at the bottom of the sea but the map doesn't show altituted so it's confusing

chiliadmystery,3beyx4,lbraud,2,Mon Jun 29 17:37:55 2015 UTC,I love this post. What could the car and red dot represent?
chiliadmystery,3beyx4,TheEvilGerman,2,Tue Jun 30 04:46:50 2015 UTC,this is the 1million dollar question buddy. There is a lot yet to understand. My first idea for the red circle was being the lighthouse cause when you take a look at the satellite map it looks exactly the same. But when i tried to represent the camp as a map it didn't fit anymore so i dunno
chiliadmystery,3beyx4,rsears14,2,Sun Jun 28 17:50:57 2015 UTC,"If the map is correct then it's something in the sea. Also if the car is a Space Docker replica, maybe it's telling us to use it in that location?"
chiliadmystery,3beyx4,DudenessOrJustDude,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:05:11 2015 UTC,You mean in the water ? Cause it looks like a small island in the hippie camp but the only kind of island we find in the alamo sea is the one near the seashark race and it doesnt really fit the location
chiliadmystery,3beyx4,Paximillian,2,Mon Jun 29 00:02:41 2015 UTC,Great stuff hippo. Do you think problem 3 could be the Altruist Camp because it has a cliff-like structure like the Altruist Camp? And then the Beam me up section would become Fort Zancudo because it has a tractor beam-like light over the bunker.
chiliadmystery,3beyx4,FoetusDestroyer,2,Mon Jun 29 23:33:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks friend. I dunno for the altruist camp but you make a really good point with the fort Z.

chiliadmystery,3beyx4,KillaPam,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:52:49 2015 UTC,it could probably be. Like the murder mystery with specific places to visit before unlocking something.

Kinda points to a karma theory if you ask me, but I'm not a big fan of karma theories right now. Just way too many variables to actually brute force a karma theory. Either you read the clues(if we even have all of them) and know exactly what to do, or we wait until we find more clues that at least narrows it down so that it's just not so open ended. I mean shit, if you wanna go full karma, not only mission choices matter, but killing certain people that you could leave alive, and not killing innocents?? I know some here have done this and seriously I give you kudos guys. Much more patience than me."
chiliadmystery,3bhws1,k-i-ll,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:50:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah but maybe its not so much karma ""good/bad"", but just our choices. I don't think it's karma as well tho. I have been following this from day one and I think with all the digging everyone one has done so far all clues point to no good route bad route scenario. But it was just the symbolism with it that I wanted to share."
chiliadmystery,3bhws1,k-i-ll,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:24:47 2015 UTC,"I would almost agree that there could be something to which choices you make during the game could affect the possibility of the mystery trigger even being active.   The whole, I'm not going to kill any innocents the entire game based on chaos on violence, yes it would be an epic troll to have to finish the game like this to be able to unlock the final mystery price but to me I would think R* might just give you a ""100% pussy award"" for not killing any innocents.  I will say there was one post where a guy that was doing the no innocents play through noticed that almost every mission he placed, there were ways to get through it without resorting to killing anyone which was incredible if the game was built in that way from the start but also implausible because we should have found at least a direction in the script files."

Making it harder, no one knows for one if there are anymore or how many there are in total to find.   Maybe there is 3 corresponding to the time in which the UFO on Chiliad appears? I've also thought maybe you have to overlay them which will require screen shots or snapmatic photos and then use something like photoshop to overlay them which creates a picture which is a clue to the Chiliad mystery? There is also the possibility that they are just added into the game for fun and because rockstar knows that we'd speculate about it."

chiliadmystery,3b6teh,Weejul,4,Fri Jun 26 13:04:46 2015 UTC,"I called 1-999-Kifflom (19995433566) and it rang a couple times and then played a beep from what sounded like a voice mail. I don't know if this a totally different secret number type thing, I just found it interesting that it actually connected and didn't say ""busy"". If you're wondering where I get the 1-999 from, I found it on one of the ammunation signs: http://i.imgur.com/3IA4wMu.jpg?1  EDIT: Also, I forgot to add, I'm not using a 100% save and I haven't actually started the Epsilon missions, might not matter, but, thought I'd mention it anyway."
chiliadmystery,3b6teh,MrFizixHD,3,Fri Jun 26 19:35:36 2015 UTC,"I checked out the other numbers, examples being: 1-999-WEAPONS and 1-999-BUGSTAR and the first thing I notice is how there are 7 letters in both of them, 1-999-KIFFLOM is the same format as these having 7 Letters after the 999 which leads me to believe it could be more tangible.  I also cross referenced the response to all of the filler number responses and none match the response that this gave. What I have found though that may or may not be important is that for Jimmy De Santa there are two numbers given for him, on most topics (and the wiki) that covered in game phone numbers:  346-555-0190 and 273-555-0143 (First number goes straight to answer phone with no talking, the second appears to be a formal response)  How this is relevant:  The first response from the first number is the same as the KIFFLOM response.  I would love to know if the reason there are 2 different numbers for Jimmy is that he was contactable on that number during a different time, ie after a certain point, the game changed the number that he was contactable on, so that at the start of the game you could use the first number, then after a certain point you had to use a different number.  If this was the case it could be enough grounds to speculate that the Kifflom number is accessible only during a certain point in the game, or that conditions would need to be met in order for it to work.  I am testing this with 100% completion and all of the Epsilon Tracts complete.  EDIT:  I have tested both Jimmy numbers at different saves in the game, one straight after the introduction of a new game, one at 52% and one at 78% in an attempt to see if the idea of changing contact numbers could be proven.  Unfortunately the responses didn't change, which leaves the question of why Jimmy has two numbers in the first place completely open.  If we knew the reasoning behind why the first number exists and why it generates that specific response we could assume that the same reasoning would be applied to the Kifflom number.    In any case an important thing to note is that Jimmy's first number is actually accredited to Jimmy by numerous sources and the fact that it generates that specific response (straight to a voicemail beep connection) rather than a standard filler response, means that more than likely the Kifflom number is actually used for something."

chiliadmystery,3b8v7s,DRUMIINATOR,2,Sun Jun 28 03:14:52 2015 UTC,could be connected to Jack Shephard From Lost witch also ties in to 108 being a very important number in the series but also a very important number to asian/indian beliefs ... basically breakig down to black & white aka Karma
chiliadmystery,3b8v7s,Herbalist40,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:54:40 2015 UTC,It was not a coincidence because they included the runtime of the movie of the parody
chiliadmystery,3b8v7s,teedoe,2,Sat Jun 27 19:13:46 2015 UTC,IMO a more solid connection for that number is to Cletus. His shirt has R-108 MK II on it.

It rolls off in a random direction, depending on how you hit it off the roof, and once it gets a certain distance from the juice stand, whether you're following it on foot or driving it around in the back of a truck or something, it usually disappears.  When I tried it, sometimes it disappeared when I let it get out of sight for a split second, sometimes it disappeared right before my eyes. Maybe it lasts longer on 8th gen or PC, I don't know.

A lot of the older hard-core hunters here gave up because they played long and hard at first, but got soft after a while and then didn't know when to pull out.

chiliadmystery,3b4xf4,dwlater,0,Fri Jun 26 04:13:34 2015 UTC,"Weird that you suggest moving with a vehicle.  I say this because if you play with the balls using a vehicle, the vehicle will flip up on the ball and for the most part be ineffective in moving the ball where you want it to go.  Another reason to be on foot?  Also, it's hard to hit the ball with an explosive while driving (only have grenades avail).  A tank is a whole different animal though.  Must try.  By the staff of Ra, this game is a trip!   No to the Fight Club reference.  The GTA series is a homage to growing up (developing one's ego / self image) in the '80's (and somewhat in the early 90's).

And after all is the only hologram and inconsistent ONE.  For that reason I always tought that it's there to distract us.  I have tons of doubt about something more is left to be found. Due to the amazing amount of players. But if there's a mistery ( not sure about that as well ) We are missing something. I don't think there's a different UFO but maybe one identical to the sunken one that actually fly.   IF there's a mistery and we are still searching the only hope is that is a very hard combination to be found even for those milions players. If that' s not the case we have no mistery at all for the same reason.  Are we trying to search a mistery or not ?
chiliadmystery,3b42wv,iAmSmokey,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:55:18 2015 UTC,"Then theres also the fact that there would be much more convenient (and especially much less misleading) symbols to represent flying. A jetpack to symbolize flying is either a massive dick move, or a dumb idea (by rockstar)."
chiliadmystery,3b42wv,iAmSmokey,2,Fri Jun 26 08:49:03 2015 UTC,I'm not saying there's no jetpack. Maybe once we trigger the events something about it came out. That means that to progress in the game we have to move.

Comparing the faded glyphs to the sunken UFO, that now seems to me absolutely correct, bring back with force the old theory of glyphs representing the X in the mural. And now the normal glyphs can easily be the hippie camp UFO. So I'm trying to figure it out with all the things we know now. Kudos goes to the friend of this guy int that post that build a reasonable theory with some flows.  https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/3b2xh1/mystery_solved_theory/  I'm trying to remove that flows.

chiliadmystery,3b42wv,SILENTSAM69,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:45:02 2015 UTC,"lol What about the ""5th"" UFO that michael gets shit out of and skydives into the city? or the ""6th"" ufo stuck in the side of that one building(sorry the name slips my mind, you know what I mean)?  I have to say the OP is horribly explained, but I honestly can't refute the fact that it's in line with what myself and others have thought.   What if what the mural/glyphs are trying to tell us is that we know what the trigger conditions could be, so go find it. My problem with this is that I feel like the UFO triggers tell us the general method of unlocking the jetpack, but all it takes is the time to be wrong, or the weather to be wrong from what we think and we waste a shit ton of time.  Think about this. Try to brute force a puzzle where you have to be in a specific place, at a specific time, with specific weather, and if the glyphs are to be believed a certain moon phase. The combinations that are possible in GTAV are MONSTROUS to the point where yea the UFO's were found really easy because I feel they were MADE to be found and then lead you on into finding the true mystery which is obviously significantly more difficult.   Some people were saying something about 7am because there are 7 lines radiating off the ""eye"" at the top of the mural, Others said 5am/5pm because of the 5 X boxes.  Now I'm just noticing for the first time that the squiggly lines at the bottom of the mural, there are 3 on each side outside of the mountain, and 6 on the UFO side inside the mountain but 7 on the jetpack side of the mountain. Very interesting because it seems like there is at least SOME type of symmetry to the mural so normally in a puzzle such as this the things that are different are the important parts. Normally...but this is what makes me believe that 2 glyph X Boxes being on the UFO side of the mural indicate the 2 conditions you need to see it, but the 3 glyph X boxes on the jetpack side mean that we need a third trigger. The glyph that shows the crescent moon makes me believe it's moon phase related, so to get the jetpack we would need to figure out at least:  Proper Location in the GTAV world map to be Proper Time to be at the location(maybe 3am, maybe 7am? maybe 5am/5pm? it's GTAV so...) Proper Weather to be happening(why is there a website(psychic website) and a booty call(ursula) that cause specific weather to happen in game) Proper Moon Phase - This and the weather are what, if true, make this an incredible pain in the ass, time and place is a given, but try to find that 1 day out of the month ON TOP OF specific weather and the proper time and place...just adding one more condition to trigger this makes unlocking it exponentially harder. This reminds me of adding entropy to encryption keys to stop them from being brute forced.  lol what a daunting brute force task. I might as well write a damn GTAV bot and let it brute force it for 6 months straight before it stumbles on the right combination.  EDIT: I said it as a joke but seriously this might be something that is doable...I have experience with running Diablo bots overnight, This is going to be very difficult though without being able to teleport around, freeze time, and other normal trainer related tasks. And my suspicion is that if we somehow magically end up accidentally triggering this thing it will connect to R* and verify that no cheats, trainers, or any other modifications were used in finding it otherwise it just doesn't trigger anyway."
chiliadmystery,3b42wv,rsears14,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:44:57 2015 UTC,Add the eventual trigger of some kind of karma play and you understand me when i think we have gazillion of possible combinations. Karma play has some solid background due to the collection of specific players stats in scripts collected. In every mission script. And is well explaind in the city mural as well. imho.

But besides that you make a good point, if youre right about the third trigger, then everyone on consoles might aswell just stop searching since on PC you can set and freeze time and weather which could actually lead to an accidental discovery...  (No, im not saying that everyone on consoles should stop searching, just man, stop wasting so much time on this shit, console players sometimes spend multiple hours to get the right conditions + loading times and the long ass haul to chilliad, you can do all of this on PC in like 5 minutes.)"

While the Zancudo and Hippie Camp UFO's are always up after 100%, they are at different heights, and well-cloaked. There's a lot more area in the sky to hide something than in the sea, especially when it can be invisible except for one brief in-game hour under rainy conditions when you are in the vicinity of it. So finding another UFO is still on the table."
chiliadmystery,3b42wv,head_bussin,3,Fri Jun 26 02:20:37 2015 UTC,"It really doesn't matter a ton how comprehensive the search was. There's so many people playing this game that brute force would have found something that big by now. Finding the non-Chiliad UFOs was the result of it, and that was only like 3 days in.   Unless there's a UFO hidden obscenely well, both in-game and in the files, there's no chance there's another UFO out there."
chiliadmystery,3b42wv,rsears14,2,Fri Jun 26 03:40:02 2015 UTC,"Well 2 years searching for a UfOs and we found just 3 human UFO not alien. A supposedly alien one in the sea. The only one not related to human without human signs or writings. We are sure alien exist in this universe cause there's one in the first mission on the ICE and a believable OMEGA now supported form this new wizzle news radio where jonah calims to be abducted, the ship exploded and parts went all over the land. Unless jonah is OMEGA. We have alien but we don't have a flying alien UFO. This things left me with a huge doubt. I wan to believe there's a ufo like the sunken one that is actually flying somewhere with specific switches. You are just telling there's nothing more to find and no mistery at all ? It's really possible but in that case what are we doing here ?"

chiliadmystery,3b42wv,iAmSmokey,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:38:44 2015 UTC,"Then how were they found? Because to my recollection, someone parachuted into Zancudo and found the UFO on the way down, which then sent everyone out on the hunt for similarly placed UFOs. That pretty quickly led to someone checking above the hippie camp, finding the UFO there.   It wouldn't be impossible for a single person to scour, say, 90% of the sky should they be so inclined. Might take a week or two (depending on how much you play,) but if I can scour 90% of the seafloor in a few days, it wouldn't be too hard at all to do the same in the sky with a fast jet. Grid it off, and 5 people could do it in a few days. Might even be easier to do it in the slow-ass blimp, if you want to be extra thorough. Even if done sloppily, you'd still manage maybe 50% of the airspace.   If you think millions of players playing for billions of player-hours missed a UFO, there's nothing stopping anyone from checking, themselves."

chiliadmystery,3b3kdp,Javaman420,5,Fri Jun 26 03:58:19 2015 UTC,"Because it's an interesting object obviously placed in a location that would require a player to actively be searching for something hidden to find it?

chiliadmystery,3b3kdp,Mantis808,5,Thu Jun 25 20:56:57 2015 UTC,There's a few threads where this has been discussed. Here's one:  http://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/33jfut/weird_noises_and_screams_near_the_lighthouse/  video of sounds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=133VnC9TaRo  The sounds happen at the tents/camp under where the ghost appears because it's likely that's where she fell to when she died. At least that sounds about right right. I also remember reading where someone had found that reversed voice in another game as well. A stock sound I guess.
chiliadmystery,3b3kdp,nighthaawk,5,Thu Jun 25 22:19:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks 4 that! Also got interested in reversing some of those sound files, since i dabble in audio engineering. Here are the (6) ones that deffo have words - ive enhanced some lower frequencies to give them whiseprs a bit more presence - all the other ones came out totally smudged to fudge.  https://soundcloud.com/carilekebusch/gta-v-spooky-whispers-from-files-x6-re-reversed  Ive placed each of the 6 phrases 4 times each to make it easier to listen without rewinding so much. Cant tell if that is a real language - could be made up also. To me it sounds like maybe a language from the area around Pakistan or India, but it also reminds me slightly of languages spoken by Eskimo tribes. Here are some (maybe) interesting patterns i noticed about these 6 whisper phrases:   Like i said, they could be made up phrases - but there is a slight pattern. The following ""letters"" apear often: S, T, I, A, SH. Especially SHISTA (means SOLD in Albanian for example). And all the phrases where very lo-fidelity, plus frequency-heavy at exactly 3000kHz (prolly due to the nasty low bit-rate of the samples).    Anyways - here is what my SWE/ENG ears heard from the phrases (remember some letters can sound simmilar, like I and E or L and V for example):   SANDO TEATOSHATA (clearest phrase no doubt!) VESNIDA SHANDA OHSTA SHIALASTA  SHISTA TASTA SHIASTASTU SHITZTA MUSTATA SHISTA (Mustache in Romanian - LOL ... Sell your mustache? .... thats weird!) HUSASEESAH HALLASTOSHEAR"
chiliadmystery,3b3kdp,Mantis808,2,Thu Jun 25 23:35:44 2015 UTC,"Good job! They sound pretty good. However, could you also put up a normal version of them, (Not reversed), just cleaned up?"
chiliadmystery,3b3kdp,SimonChristophertv,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:27:11 2015 UTC,I was intending to do that but found the originals to really be backwards and therefore most likely totally impossible to hear any words in.

chiliadmystery,3b4mky,k-i-ll,3,Fri Jun 26 21:19:09 2015 UTC,With so many weapons in the game having different effects I'm still suspicious that using a weapon a certain way could be a trigger...specifically the baseball bat you find at the altruists and the stun gun.  Also can someone confirm that there is no way to get the night vision sniper scope outside of that one mission. I always thought it was suspicious to have the map in letters house that specifically underlines night vision. Also isn't there that infinity8 secret message you can only see with the space docker headlights? If there is one we can't discount the possibility of there being more than that but it seems like nothing was ever found but the one.
chiliadmystery,3b4mky,deltaninethc420,3,Fri Jun 26 00:04:49 2015 UTC,"Night vision leads you to see a sasquatch ""big foot"" which is seen on file boxes in lesters house so we know hes looking for big foot. You can see him on a specific mission where your trying to kill the rest of the O'Neil brothers so maybe thats why night vision is underlined. Pointing us to that easter egg.  @rsears. The effects of the weapons were added into the game with the ill gotten gains update. The patch notes, mention ""cars now being damaged appropriately when using melee weapons on current gen and pc"". So it may just be a graphical thing. Like, baseball bat will cause all cars to look one way, a crowbar another. And bullet holes in general probably look a standard way no matter where they are.  EDIT. I know you showed pic of solar panel not a car but im just pointing out as an example that it may be a graphical thing between 2 different weapons being used on surfaces."

chiliadmystery,3b3ps5,SimonChristophertv,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:23:53 2015 UTC,"It kinda seems out there to me... But idk. The chilliad UFO is either has cloaking technology, is a hologram, or is just incomplete right?"
chiliadmystery,3b3ps5,tmkg420,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:26:32 2015 UTC,It doesn't seems to me a cloacking devices. To see it you have to be in a specific zone. If you get away from that zone in EVERY direction the UFO disappear. Not only going to the UFO but also gettin away from the observation point in opposite directions.  I don't think is incomplete as well. It's the major easter egg off all the game and Rockstar had 2 years to complete it. I can't think of anything different from an hologram. It also have some noises around like a bad projection.

chiliadmystery,3b3ps5,Diabolic73,0,Fri Jun 26 14:19:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe this was how they were originally going to let the player know that there are ufo parts to collect, but decided it was too subtle so then they inserted the first meeting with omega."
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,Bipolaricecap,13,Thu Jun 25 15:16:24 2015 UTC,"This is a good theory, and possibly true.  The thing is, with the amount of easter eggs and secrets in this game which aren't necessarily linked to the mural, we'll probably always think that the mystery is incomplete.   Even in a few years time, if we find a jetpack, we class the main mystery as ""solved"", I guarantee that there will always be people who think that there's more to it, so for that reason I don't think the mystery is solved, or will be solved any time soon."
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,MediumBloke,4,Thu Jun 25 15:51:34 2015 UTC,"As far as we know going by game files there is no jetpack, but even if we've solved all there is to solve at this time, Rockstar have been clever by using the jetpack symbol because it allows for one to be added into the game in the future and we'll all be wondering if it was there all along."
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,bluntsarebest,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:13:10 2015 UTC,"as far as we know from the game files, there was a file with the name jetpack. People said it was removed but maybe it was just hidden better."
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,Ungreth,2,Sat Jun 27 15:45:35 2015 UTC,So why all the precise conditions to see a ufo on Chiliad peak when you can simply fly a chopper above the desert camp mural and see the exact same ufo without meeting any of those conditions at all?
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,noodlz05,5,Thu Jun 25 18:54:26 2015 UTC,"Because Rockstar placed those UFOs thinking no one would just randomly stumble upon them. They knew people would be going to the ""shed"", so they put the mural there. When you see the mural, your first thought is that you're looking at Mt. Chilliad. So you go up to the top of the mountain just a few feet away, and see there's a message and an eye underneath the viewing platform that matches the mural. Now that that's confirmed, you try to figure out what these Xs mean. Oh...look, there's 5 glyphs on the side of the mountain that roughly correspond with the mural. Decipher those glyphs, and now you know something happens when it's raining at 3am when the ""story is complete"", so you go back up to the top and see the UFO. That's great, now what? Well there's three other icons there at the bottom we haven't figured out. I think this is what most people are caught up on since it depicts a jetpack. I personally think these are just references to the other UFOs in the game, since Rockstar figured those would be nearly impossible to find otherwise. One is referencing the hippy camp with the obvious UFO reference, the jetpack is a reference to San Andreas and the military base, and the egg is in reference to Paleto Bay and it's cracked because it's crashed in the ocean. I think that's all there is to it. Rockstar just assumed it'd be much harder to find the other UFOs than it ended up being, and since word traveled so fast across the internet, the order in which things were discovered by people varied...so a lot of people are feeling unfulfilled by this grand mystery and thinking there's more to it than there is. You just have to imagine figuring all of that out on your own, and not having the internet at your disposal. If you unraveled the mystery on your own using the mural, it would've been amazing...but because everyone just looked up the locations and went straight to them without any effort whatsoever, and were able to deduce what the mural means in hindsight, it seems like a really easy puzzle. I'm sure there's still hidden stuff and references in the game that haven't been figured out, but I doubt it's anything major (like the unlocking of a jetpack or flyable UFOs)."
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,Ungreth,0,Thu Jun 25 19:50:15 2015 UTC,"I don't buy that. The desert camp ufo is the easiest to find and the storyline takes you there before you ever reach the top of Chiliad in non-exploratory gameplay. Everything about the desert camp shouts ""Aliens!"" and the fact that right beneath the ufo is a big red dot pointed to by a big arrow makes this one way more obvious than the Chiliad ufo, which is actually darned tough to spawn given the rain at 3am pre-requisite. So I still have to wonder, because your explanation provides no satisfactory answer, why the specific conditions to view the Chiliad ufo when you can easily spot the same ufo in the skies above the desert camp?"
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,KillaPam,-1,Fri Jun 26 14:34:16 2015 UTC,"You do know that ""Shed"" existed before it was first shown in the trailer? I don't fully understand why people think Rockstar crafted all this after we saw the trailer. I'd imagine this is something they've worked with during the game's development.  People didn't all assume there would be a beating heart inside the Statue of Happiness when everyone saw the gtaIV trailer for the first time. Or did they?"
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,noodlz05,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:15:56 2015 UTC,"It definitely existed, because they had the lift there the whole time. The question is, did they decide to put the mural there after everyone started speculating? Either way, its not really that relevant since my main point is that the mural is very likely solved, it just doesn't seem that way since it was solved so quickly."
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,AnEvilVet,-1,Fri Jun 26 03:23:01 2015 UTC,Have you thought that maybe all of the hype about the shed was started by some Rockstar accounts?
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,XxSCRAPOxX,2,Mon Jun 29 11:48:32 2015 UTC,"I thought the exact same thing without ever having come to the forums. After reading the forums I thought there was more. I want to believe, the only Hole I see in your friends theory is the lines. Everyone feels Like they represented a tunnel, or path, or order to the steps involved or whatever. But yeah, it's very possible just seeing the ufos was it. I thought it was before I started reading the ramblings of you psychos here. Really though, there should be a jet pack. It was on the older games it has to be in this one."
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,gazzy82,2,Fri Jun 26 12:52:17 2015 UTC,"This is 100% correct.  A great many people are unwilling to admit it though, even to themselves."
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,UndeadOP,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:03:55 2015 UTC,"I still think that the mural is telling us to find 5 UFOs, two that are driven/made by aliens, and three that are man-made by the government.   We've found one out of two alien-made ones, which is the Sunken UFO.  We've found two out of three man-made ones, which are Hippie Camp UFO and Zancudo UFO.  I'd count the Chiliad UFO as the third man-made one, but I have a feeling that the Chiliad UFO is represented as the big eye on top, and by that being the start of the mural's meaning, it is letting us know that the other X's below it are other UFOs."

chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,HakatoX,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:16:39 2015 UTC,I say this almost weekly.  Then where are the typical game completing rewards or 100% rewards.  Line up every other GTA game and it makes no sense at all.
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,adamisking,6,Thu Jun 25 16:07:46 2015 UTC,"But there ARE 100% rewards, your comment is just not true.   And in my opinion they are much better than GTA 4's.  In 4 all you get is the ability to buy an unlimited amount of ammunition  (not free!) and an achievement.  In 5 you get (so  far) a whole extra bonus mission, 3 well hidden (without internet help) Easter eggs, a 100% shirt and an achievement.  They might be unsatisfying from a mystery standpoint, but they still stand up against the previous title."
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,teedoe,2,Thu Jun 25 16:36:32 2015 UTC,Did any of the previous versions or the current one for that matter ever give a splash screen saying that the user had completed the game to 100%?
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,adamisking,2,Thu Jun 25 18:01:08 2015 UTC,"What better way to keep people playing the game than offering shitty rewards at the end. I hope, for all the effort everyone on here has put in, that we haven't received all the rewards."
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,adamisking,0,Thu Jun 25 17:28:41 2015 UTC,"Eh? What part of my comment was disrespectful? It's just the truth.  OK then well here's a list of all 100% rewards for past GTAs. http://gta.wikia.com/100%25_Completion  How many of those 100% rewards are inarguably better than 5's? Maybe San Andreas and Vice City? So 2 out of 7? And even then it's just things like unlimited ammo and increased health, nothing mindblowing.  And this is the first time you've actually got an extra mission for 100%, which takes more programming time and is more interesting to me than just infinite ammo or a tank being spawned.  You're unsatisfied, fine, but don't kid yourself that previous GTA's had comparatively amazing 100% rewards.   As I said, it's just not true.  Oh and I haven't downvoted you btw, weird reaction. Bit paranoid lol."
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,adamisking,2,Thu Jun 25 17:39:52 2015 UTC,"I think the presence of the jetpack sign and the lack of an actual jetpack will leave everyone disappointed regardless of the extra mission/100% shirt/UFOs, but I have to agree, they are much better in this game than previous."
chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,KillaPam,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:36:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, if there's nothing else it'll be disappointing from a mystery standpoint and the inclusion of the jetpack symbol is either intentional trolling or poorly thought out from Rockstar."

So do you agree previous GTA rewards usually (5 out of 7), and certainly the most recent (and therefore relevant) GTA's, weren't substantially better then 5's?  Because then, logically, there no reasoning behind saying 'There must be more rewards because there were more rewards in most previous GTAs', when that statement just isn't true in the first place?"

chiliadmystery,3b2xh1,head_bussin,2,Thu Jun 25 18:08:52 2015 UTC,"I think the x's are there simply because it would have made it too easy to just place the glyphs on the mural, sort of like an 'x' marks the spot(s) treasure map making it take a little longer to find them.

E.g. The hamburger sign apparently isn't legible in the lowest settings, but is in the 360/PS3 versions, so it is to me still potentially relevant.  Would say the same that for anything that the highest PC settings makes readable that wasn't in the originals, to my mind probably isn't relevant to the mystery."

I've always thought Paleto Bay seemed a lot like Humboldt -- a small coastal community with some farming, an economy based on corruption and weed, with very tall trees and a huge lumber mill. Likewise, some of the far north seems like Pt Reyes, with large tracts of hilly open land and some ""secret"" bases (in real life there's quite a lot of Nike missle base silos, and local legend claims that a nearby mountain (Tamalpais) was hollowed out by the Navy and contains a major secret facility), and Raton Canyon looks very much like Yosemite (there's even a tunnel through Chilliad right in to s view of it).

See post if your wanting info on observatory https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/35dmdk/is_obsevatory_obelix_is_lightning_conductor_for/
chiliadmystery,3axq4g,dwlater,2,Wed Jun 24 10:25:35 2015 UTC,"Again, your overlay is being squashed vertically. You have to keep the aspect ratio the same and then scale up/scale down the source image or the overlay concept is void due to it being manipulated to fit. Rotation is also fine."
chiliadmystery,3axq4g,WarBob,3,Wed Jun 24 18:29:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think the aspect ratio (being squashed or not) is that crucial - what if it's NOT supposed to be overlaid from straight up, but rather at an angle?  When applied to a flat 2D map like this, it would change the aspect ratio. That's fine.  It's a 3D world, let's not limit ourselves to 2D.  Just my opinion, of course."
chiliadmystery,3axq4g,dwlater,2,Wed Jun 24 23:26:25 2015 UTC,"It is crucial for the very fact that if you modify the aspect ratio or squash the image you make it fit the theory being presented.  If it's intended as an overlay (something I don't personally think it is), then it needs to be taken and used as given, otherwise it can literally fit anything you want it to."
chiliadmystery,3axq4g,WarBob,2,Thu Jun 25 03:32:24 2015 UTC,"Hmm, let me grab some images to better show what I mean...  OK, I've found two, that don't really show this perfectly as they are slightly different sizes also, but hopefully should get my point across.  The first one has a standard overlay, with the plane of the mural at 90 degrees to the ground:  http://imgur.com/4SUVbYe  But in this second one, the creator (not me) has tried to map the mural around the surface of the mountain. The plane the mural rests on is roughly 45 degrees relative to the ground:  http://imgur.com/vM2yaFl  The first one I would call a 2D attempt, while the second one I would call 3D.  Now, if you look at them both from the same viewpoint, the second one should appear to have a different aspect ratio, because of the perspective.    With the observatory overlays, seen from above, a flat one (resting on the ground) should indeed have a 1:1 aspect ratio, but if the plane the overlay is resting on is 45 degrees to the ground, it could seem closer to 1.4:1 when seen from directly above.  I hope this helps explain my thinking.  TL;DR Think in 3D, not 2D."
chiliadmystery,3axq4g,dwlater,2,Thu Jun 25 04:04:35 2015 UTC,"I do see what you mean and it is a unique take on the mural from what I've seen, but as I mentioned, it's still victim to manipulation.  Even in 3D space, By squashing and stretching it, you could make it fit whatever supports your theory.  So to me it seems unlikely is all."
chiliadmystery,3axq4g,WarBob,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:12:44 2015 UTC,"I'll just note, I'm not suggesting stretching or squashing it in 3D space - keep it with a perfect 1:1 aspect ratio, just lie in on an inclined plane, so from a particular point of view, the perspective makes it APPEAR stretched/squashed.  I could get even crazier, by suggesting that the sun, from any point in the sky could shine through this inclined overlay and cast all sorts of crazily-proportioned shadows on the ground.  But I agree with you, it is unlikely this would be the solution.  Just not impossible."
chiliadmystery,3axq4g,WarBob,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:26:17 2015 UTC,"I can sort of see how that'd work to some extent. But really you'd need to somehow project the texture onto the geometry. Doing it manually in Photoshop would have a certain amount of guess work.  But yeah, I sort of see what you mean?  That said, providing the camera is in the right place and angle before doing that in Photoshop, you wouldn't even need to distort the overlay. Just overlay it."
chiliadmystery,3axq4g,WarBob,0,Fri Jun 26 03:14:58 2015 UTC,"Overlays are not  about getting things to fit . The images are to explain thought process .Not one overlay even scaled correctly has ever fit . I have software to scale things up and down . Using the word AGAIN makes me out to be a fraud when i am not trying to give solid proof of anything, only a concept , a visual representation .If your looking for an overlay that fits exact , you will never find one . The best thing about overlays is the fact that pictures paint a thousand words.Dont look for a fit , look for the thing in the picture that takes you to the next step .Anyway the picture was taken from a helicopter like i said , at an angle so if you wanted a fit , good look to you , you would have to work out the angle it was taken at and input that into the equation .That would be a task."
chiliadmystery,3axq4g,hongkong_97,2,Thu Jun 25 07:30:24 2015 UTC,That mural's been manipulated to fit so it doesn't count as a viable overlay.  It's been squashed vertically and sheared to the bottom-right.

I only rotated and scaled, no shear or squash. That being said, as I posted in another thread this overlay makes no sense whatsoever as it ignores the biggest landmark at the observatory. Furthermore even if the overlay is taken as a drawing instead of a perfect overlay (my opinion) there is nothing in the vicinity to further the quest.   Thoughts?"

I was down at this wall yesterday and there is no way out of this place except for on-foot, and there is a giant trail leading right to it.

Franklin pursues Mike with the intent of murder, once a life is in Franks hands he realises this is wrong (in my game Frank will l not kill unless being killed), Mike is slipping from his grasp.

One of the boxes is in the electric place, the other is right on top of the elevator, the other boxes are placed precisely where there are boxes on the groun ingame. But then again the ''mountain'' shape does not match up very well.   About not finding any cracks, I didnt mean that there would be an actual crack. what I ment was, when you for example shoot explosives on the dome in the supposed crack area, the darkness from the explosion (dont know the word for it, but you know, the area gets darker where the explosion was, like a shadow) is shaped as a crack.

Yes it could be just a fancy way of Rockstar saying there's a weapon there, but what if it's more? And what about those weird lines and boxes on the ground around the Observatory? Those do not exist on the real life counterpart of the Observatory, and while I could understand if they for example put other buildings that do not exist on the real observatory, I really cant see the point of adding lines on the ground, it serves absolutely no purpose to add something that insignificant. That's why I believe the lines and boxes on the ground have a reason for being there, and I'd bet that it's mystery-related"
chiliadmystery,3awd1z,Powermatjes,2,Wed Jun 24 02:18:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, except shoot for the stars. Most if not all of the weapons on the map have a clue to find them. The clue is just to find the sniper. The scope is like a telescope so obviously the clue makes sense. People have just taken the sniper clue too far. Nobody is blowing shit up or searching graves because of the pistol and grenade clues, but everyone is raving over the idea that a clue for a sniper is somehow different. If its something to do with the moon/sun/telescopes I don't think it has anything whatsoever to do with that clue, its for finding the sniper. I'm not saying don't investigate the sky shit I'm just saying there's every reason to believe it's just the clue for the sniper tthat people are obsessed with.

chiliadmystery,3at94o,Suplolx,14,Tue Jun 23 09:27:20 2015 UTC,In programming it's better to have all related component parts on one texture so you can ultimately save space by reusing it over and over. I think it's called a sprite. If there are no other similar signs in the whole of GTA V then it would mean that this sign is geared up to say other stuff.  I mean if it was only supposed to say that one cryptic thing then it would've just had that one flat message in the files cos it would've taken up less space.
chiliadmystery,3at94o,willdabeast,3,Tue Jun 23 10:26:44 2015 UTC,I agree. I think we have to rule out the possible fact that it's reused in other parts of the game.

In game they appear to have a more yellowed and weathered appearance overall.  Also in game they seem to almost have an embossed look, with highlights and shadows opposed to a flat typeface.  Is it just because of the in game rendering or possibly because of how zoomed the texture is in game that's caused it to become blurry?"

chiliadmystery,3at94o,Stealth_Pyro,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:53:33 2015 UTC,Just throwing it out there... If the sign really doesn't have anything special about it & the textures were created before hand... it wouldn't be that big of a surprise to have the entire alphabet. Maybe they left it that way so that the designers could change what it says. Maybe they didn't have a set message initially so they just gave them the whole alphabet until they could come up with something. It doesn't really effect the file size significantly to include them. I have seen plenty game sprite sheets that include entire foreign alphabet characters that aren't ever used within the game. EDIT: But great find... totally not discrediting that.

chiliadmystery,3au5z2,PandaLovingLion,-1,Tue Jun 23 16:02:52 2015 UTC,"At this point IMO the mystery is stuck on finding the second step towards the solution. This is just an idea that tries to put order to the chaos of clues. Like I said, take from it what you want."

chiliadmystery,3au5z2,SuperMaruoBrassiere,2,Tue Jun 23 21:05:44 2015 UTC,why not overlay a Monopoly board onto the map and see what you land on when you roll a dice three times?   Maybe a Ouija board would work better? ;-)
chiliadmystery,3au5z2,username156,2,Tue Jun 23 22:38:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The post said ""in darts there's a game called 'Around the World'"". Well, there's also a dart game called Baseball and countless other dart games.

Sometimes random other textures seem to overlay themselves onto things in-game and on the roads and such.  I mean, there's not even really a logic as to why a mystery related clue would be an arbitrary dart board randomly on some generic cargo truck."

In the 100% checklist you can call the 5 Xs the 5 categories needed for 100%  You could consider them the 5 Glyphs  The 5 Heist's  5 Key locations  To me I look at them as actions, 2 things to see the UFO after 100%. I think the right said requires 3 actions/triggers to obtain the Jetpack.   Not sure if the 2 triggers for the UFO (time&weather) carry over in conjunction with the 3 triggers for the Jetpack, in total of 5 triggers.   I feel like the Mystery hinders on 5 specific triggers, 2 of them we already know."

chiliadmystery,3awltw,KillaPam,-2,Thu Jun 25 02:49:46 2015 UTC,I think that represents how complex and connected the template of 5 X's are. In the end I think we need a total of 5 triggers. We know 2 triggers that spawn the Chiliad UFO.

chiliadmystery,3awltw,kultrazero,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:19:19 2015 UTC,"I believe that the ones at the hippy camp are there as clues that there is a UFO at the site.  Rockstar created a lot of hype on Reddit before GTA V was released by putting 'the shed' at the top of Mt Chiliad in the trailer. Therefore the first thing a lot of people would do is go to that shed.  The easiest way up is via the cable car and the game will show you a glyph before you get to the mural. You then see the mural with a picture of the mountain and some Xes on it, one if which is by the line in the middle. This line shows on your map and you recognise that it's the cable car, so you search and find other glyphs roughly in the places marked by an X.  After some trial and error you eventually see the UFO and you realise that the symbols at the bottom suggest other locations. You remember seeing the same model of UFO on the mural on top of a car at the hippy camp. You get there and look around and see another glyph. This confirms to you that there is another UFO there and you eventually find it.  There's no glyphs at the airforce base because it's very secure property and the painter couldn't get in.  There is a nice set of lights that show though.  There are no glyphs at Paleto Bay but not everyone has access to a submarine though. You will though and the game takes you past the sunken UFO on the nuclear waste missions.  That's how it worked for me anyway :)."

I consider the black strawberry much more of a ""regular"" graffiti mark, whereas the Red Strawberry is near some significant areas. I usually attribute the mark as a reference to Mirror Park, which is generally lit like a strawberry/heart at night time.     At the general location of the * in relation to mirror park (as it is on the graffiti), there's a power station next to the train tracks. The trains seem to pass fairly frequently. Calling the phone number on the door yielded nothing. I also tried using explosives on the station at multiple places with no luck.

IRL He's a New York Artist, and has really nothing to do with LA. So why have a whole gallery featuring a non-LA artist? Possibly because his images are deep stories, and take considerable amount of scrutiny, and often rare knowledge of local culture/landmarks to deconstruct and understand? Even Basquiat's most frenetic creations have some story and depth to them. They are like mazes, or dare I say... treasure maps?  I agree, its a pretty good tribute to Basquiat's style, but where does that say there is nothing to be gained from understanding them?

I didn't watch his YouTube video because I don't watch them on this subreddit so I have no idea what connections he's made. Hopefully he'll read through all the amazingly formatted posts we have on this subreddit and try again but until then this is just another link to YouTube that is going to be buried."

chiliadmystery,3atdab,Bazza2556,7,Tue Jun 23 10:24:38 2015 UTC,I think this is stretching things a bit - lots of vehicles have digital speedometres these days. I can see no reason why the insurgent should possibly be related to the Mystery.
chiliadmystery,3atdab,CaptainJackalope,-2,Tue Jun 23 12:38:29 2015 UTC,"So you think the programers created the mystery and then stopped giving hints ? didnt bother to take advantage of DLC ? I think not, i believe they are active in the dlc even if its just a hint here or there .Keeps us guessing .Last week someone found a ufo on a gun from the dlc , so this proves the programmers are still toying with our minds .Some of it might be relevant .I refuse to believe that the mystery is just related to the story .It just doesnt sit right.Thankyou for your reply."
chiliadmystery,3atdab,hatton101,5,Tue Jun 23 13:55:03 2015 UTC,"That speedo is used in a lot of vehicles. I know the bugstar vans use them. Also, this is online, which afaik doesn't tie into the chiliad mystery."
chiliadmystery,3atdab,dwlater,-9,Tue Jun 23 13:15:37 2015 UTC,This is what i expected even though there are 2 speedometers one looking just like the one on the dash of the delorean .So its a definite deadend and its also a definite that the mystery is not related to online .I dont remember that being de-bunked but if you say thats correct you must have got the information from Rockstar .How did you do that ? Also can you give me a link to the thread where it was solved ? or is it in the wiki and i just missed it? Thanks for your time and effort.
chiliadmystery,3atdab,dwlater,6,Tue Jun 23 13:35:05 2015 UTC,"Passive Aggression wont get you anywhere. Although CaptainJack is being quite dismissive in his response, I think that a lot of followers of the mystery would generally agree that the need to solve the mystery online, using online only content would be a hugely irresponsible for rockstar. A good deal play dont play online, weather that because they dont have a crew to do heists with, dont like the idea off it or simply object to paying to go online once they have already payed a game (xbox live and PS plus).  If it was content added that is available both on and offline then their is merit to your discovery, because while you will still need a live internet connection to get the content you can still be involved in the mystery and the hunt while playing SP.   Bazza's response was more insightful, and posted a better argument against you thought. Since the insurgent, was added for use in online heists that do not relate to the mystery, logically a vehicle added for them most likely wouldn't have anything to do with it.  All that being said, I like the outside off the box thinking you have with relation to using the 1st person view to gain an advantage that would help new gen players but not restrict old gen players.

I upvoted your comment as i do most cos i do agree with people who challenge my thinking .I am not the most intelligent person in the world i will be the first to admit , but i am all about the thinking outside the box , thinking of every angle no matter how trivial.I also believe it is highly unlikely that the mystery stretches to online play , but i will not dismiss it untill someone can give FULL sign sealed and delivered proof otherwise . Thanks for the comment hatton101 . One thing i am noticing lately is people say things in their posts as if they have been proven whereas hardly anything since day one has actually been proven .People need to stop talking like that. Thats not passive aggression its my observation. Keep on keeping on !!!"
chiliadmystery,3atdab,dwlater,4,Tue Jun 23 14:09:44 2015 UTC,"Personally, I see no real reason the mystery couldn't be in Online.  It comes free with the game after all, and it seems pretty much expected by game publishers these days that everyone will get their console online.  Plus, the more people online, the better their weekly stats look. They WANT people online."
chiliadmystery,3atdab,iAmSmokey,0,Tue Jun 23 22:46:00 2015 UTC,"A very important overlooked point in the whole GTA5 world is the fact that people rip the game and put it on torrent sites .These file shares P2P whatever you want to call them cannot be used to gain online access , thus shutting them out of the mystery .This is  a major up yours from the industry to the file sharers in my opinion .Basically saying f**k you , you cant complete the mystery untill you have completed the story mode and done the thing online .This is just an idea of mine .The mural is still there when you visit it online and the wiki states that we are trying to figure out the mural and that is what this sub redit is all about , so it cant be dismissed even if it is just a 1% probability.I believe maybe the hunters dont want it to be online or a combination of both because it opens too many more doors and makes things infinitley more complicated!! I am a P.C. gamer through and through and have only joined the mystery a few months back , but one thing i noticed right from the beginning was the mass hysteria and the advertisements of online gta5 and the adventure of searching a new world ONLINE .That is what appealed to me and why i couldnt wait to buy the game.I have to admit i didnt even touch story mode for 2 weeks after getting the game .The game save files are out there for everyone to use .You cant get anything like that for online play .Online play is pure and untouched everytime you enter. Just my opinion !! Happy hunting!!"

chiliadmystery,3appmd,AcolyteProd,3,Mon Jun 22 15:37:13 2015 UTC,"The Alamo Sea is based on the Salton Sea in Southern California. It is named after the Alamo River, which drains into the Salton Sea. Just like the real Salton Sea, it is very polluted and fish bones can be seen along the lake's shores. However, the shores of the Salton Sea are not inhabited by rednecks; the opposite, the Coachella Valley by the lake is advertised as one of the most gay-friendly places in America."
chiliadmystery,3appmd,LittleDannyB,3,Mon Jun 22 17:15:16 2015 UTC,"The shores of the Salton Sea are a meth head paradise.  Nothing but abandoned buildings, RV squatters camps, and not much else.  There are a number of hot springs which bring out older people and nudists, but those are a few miles from shore.  Where you are talking about is further north about 20 miles in the developed area that runs from Palm Springs out to Coachella, that is filled with people who have retired from working in Hollywood."

Then I discovered the rocket on my second search - there's a rocket with the Up & Atom logo on the side which has smoke coming out of its bottom and has a Geiger counter sound emanating from it. So naturally I tried to blow it up. Apparently the game developers felt the need for the police to refer to it as 'The Up & Atom Diner' over the radio instead of say, 'Paleto Cove' meaning it may have some importance after all."

In the game files the textures of the sign are named after the Mojito Inn (the building close to the sign) http://imgur.com/0Qh91HY   So it seems  unlikely that the sign is associated to the Up & Atom restaurant although it's still possible.  More interestingly, from a game file point of view, is that the textures of the ""code"" part of the sign are nowhere to be found in the associated file path. The model of the entire sign is there but the sign is blank in the modelviewer and there are no textures embedded in it either. http://imgur.com/t022eft  This is strange because normally the textures of buildings and signs are either embedded in the models texture or found in the same file path where the model was found. I've been looking for the textures without succes. Any thoughts?"
chiliadmystery,3anvxc,Suplolx,3,Mon Jun 22 14:56:53 2015 UTC,Could this possibly mean that the message on the sign can change dynamically based on other actions in game? I find it interesting that the actual text of the hamburger sign isn't in the files. How is it even generated so it's displayed in game then? This could be important in and of itself.
chiliadmystery,3anvxc,k-i-ll,2,Mon Jun 22 16:42:22 2015 UTC,"I know this is really interesting. Allthough we have to remember that just because I haven't found it, doesn't mean it's not in the files.

Since reading the post on this riddle being solved  http://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/06/the-trials-evolution-riddle-has-been-solved-and-it-is-truly-unbelievable/ posted by infidelcastro13 I am leaning back towards there being a real life connection to  the mystery and would also like to ask if there are any other co-ordinates hidden around los santos .These co-ordinates dont seem to be usable in game so why would they put them there?
chiliadmystery,3apb24,ZergCAN,2,Mon Jun 22 12:27:16 2015 UTC,"Hey I was invoked here so I thought I might add a bit of clarity to the original post that I made, and add my thought on this one.  First Exhibit A: http://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/04/the-trials-hd-riddle-finally-revealed/  So the original Trials game had a mystery as well. So what, you say. It took 2 years to get the answer to it. The users never solved it, Redlynx gave them the answer. Personally, I think the first one's payoff was pretty lame, as it's very similar (pretty much exact) to the lame explanations to the Chiliad Mystery given here by the naysayers and those that are tired of putting effort into the mystery. So if the Naysayers are right - Then R* completely ripped off the trials, not parodied it.  Exhibit B- http://www.kotaku.com.au/2013/02/dear-god-it-looks-like-there-is-another-trials-riddle/  Here is were I'd like to point out just the flurry of FALSE statements made in the comments to the other post. I'm not spending my time googling when the exact date when Trial was released or going to Trialsforum to find out when they first discovered that there was another riddle- I'm not interested in that. The point is that it was first reported on by kotaku in February of 2013. So, IDK, seeing that the last clue was solved earlier this month, does that sound like it happened relatively quickly to anyone here now? And I think, considering it was one guy working diligently with cyphers, had it not been for him, they would of have been stuck in the mud like the first Trials riddle and like we are here today. We have some clues solved, and a lot of unanswered questions. The Famous Hamburger sign is an unanswered question. Why would we think we can go any further with out having that solved.  So about our mystery correlating to real life..? Who knows? We're stumped by several clues in the game, and until they're answered, It would be pretty foolish to start searching the real world, but that's just my opinion, man.  So ...uh...maybe?"

chiliadmystery,3apb24,XxSCRAPOxX,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:07:19 2015 UTC,Dont you mean it Might  simply be an easter egg .You must be able to prove it .What if it happened to point to a programmers back garden or grandmas attic full of GTA loot and we just overlooked it cos we thought it was just a joke egg thrown in for fun ? In order to understand the programmers you must start to think like them .Imagine being a head programmer working at R* for years wanting to go down in history already stinking rich so money doesnt matter its all about the glory.What would you do .I know i would send people all over the globe and that means co-ordinates .Maybe those co-ordinates are just an egg but i think there are some hidden in the game waiting to be found.Thankyou for your input .

Its both and it cleary says that when you segregate and rearrange. We are easter egg hunting for clues to solve a hidden mystery in a video game not real life and the mystery itself is an easter egg. Clues are easter eggs. We dont go out in real life and say that murder clue is an easter egg because it real life its not an interactive scene made by programmers, its real life it wasn't intentional  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(interaction_design)  An easter egg is for interactive work not real life its an intentional thing placed in an interactive program. It can be cool, neat and ""oh yeah"" kind of stuff or it can hide a secret message or even unlock hidden levels in games."
chiliadmystery,3apb24,dwlater,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:29:57 2015 UTC,"Easter egg (interaction design):       An Easter egg is an intentional inside joke, hidden message, or feature in an interactive work such as a computer program, video game or DVD menu screen. The name has been said to evoke the idea of a traditional Easter egg hunt.   According to game designer Warren Robinett, this traditional term was coined into the context of media by Atari personnel who were alerted to the presence of a secret message which had been hidden by Robinett in his already widely distributed game, Adventure.   Released in 1979, Atari's Adventure contains the first video game Easter egg to have been discovered by its players; the hidden item is the name of the game's programmer, Warren Robinett. Robinett inserted his Easter egg late in the game's development in an attempt to gain some recognition for his work, as Atari then kept its programmers' names secret.   In 2004, an earlier Easter egg was found in Video Whizball, a 1978 game for the Fairchild Channel F system, displaying programmer Bradley Reid-Selth's surname.   This practice is similar in some respects to hidden signature motifs such as Diego Rivera's inclusion of himself in his murals, Alfred Hitchcock's cameo appearances, Fritz's appearances in the works of Chris van Allsburg, and various ""Hidden Mickeys"" that can be found throughout the various Disney Parks.

Back when we were seperated we'd look for ideal qualities among our fellow tribes and whatnot. Seeing different ethnic groups as the same is a byproduct of this. By being white, you're programmed to rip apart and analyse traits of other whites, but not other groups. Obviously we're recently begun to mix since we invented transportation, but the instinct is still there. So it's not so much racist. Unless you said ""all you niggers are the same"", then it is.

chiliadmystery,3aldcq,hippoplay,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:43:23 2015 UTC,Hmm.... that's something different but really weird too. Does every storm trigger this motion of the moon?
chiliadmystery,3aldcq,De_Doctor,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:59:46 2015 UTC,i don't know. What i can say is that it was only rain and it was at the moment the new weather came in that the moon started acting like that
chiliadmystery,3aldcq,hippoplay,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:08:02 2015 UTC,Your video on the moons direction before storm I thought maybe it was getting stuck like shadows do thats why shadows on deck appear to glitch but the moon in your video is shown going in a circle slowly to adjust itself not adjusting itself quick like this video. I think they are different. If anything your video hippo is more interesting because its happens slowly throughout night
chiliadmystery,3aldcq,deltaninethc420,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:34:16 2015 UTC,"I will try to reproduct this but it's difficult because the rain has to come naturally, with cheat it doesn't work. In fact i was recording moon patterns from different nights when it happened"

chiliadmystery,3aldcq,myinnertrevor,2,Tue Jul 7 20:20:32 2015 UTC,you're right. The problem is that i'm on a 1.6% save so i need to do stuff again to have booty calls but i'll have to try it also with the kind of eclipse
chiliadmystery,3aldcq,mazdarati2,2,Tue Jul 7 23:25:32 2015 UTC,"Ive never seen moon do this but I have seen shadows do this...the moon and shadows are already moving and sometimes the shadows get ""stuck"" you'll look away just as you did in video and when you look back at it you may not notice it was stuck but the game does so it corrects itself to where it should be and you will see this happen. It happens a lot at the observatory when watching the obelisk shadows"

chiliadmystery,3aldcq,gbajere,2,Sun Jun 21 15:46:10 2015 UTC,Wow. Good find. Seems to me the full moon acts like a new moon flip at midnight. I'll check to see if this happens on other phases.

Never posted, only commented. But what is the actual end game pursuit here? Is it a jet pack? A flyable ufo? I've tried testing theories on my 100% Xbox one but really now... Should we look at the fact that rockstar put really obscure hints just to lead us on and hope that we would spend thousands of collective hours trying to find something that isn't really there?         How let down would the community be if they put a jet pack in a crate at the altruist camp in a future SP dlc and played it off as the answer to the ""mystery"". Would we feel like  these last two years have been a giant circle jerk? Granted it has been fun at times, but searching the ocean floor for hours on a grid or watching shadows form at multiple locations around the map for some clue that may or may not exist can't be progressive for us as hunters and gamers  as a whole.      If rockstar just casually adds the answer to all our questions and theories with a simple side quest reward in a dlc there will be a lot of let down fans and that looks bad for them and reflects poorly on all of us. Sorry if this is a drunken rant and I'm sure there have been a few posts/ comments like this in the past. Sorry for wasting your time if this upsets you. Kifflom   Tl;dr : I know it's about the journey and not the destination, but this is getting comparable to the trek to Mordor. if this mystery is solved by dlc (which seems to be the only viable option now) I'm going to eat dog shit for wasting countless hours of my precious life"

DO that kind of thing if you're enjoying the actual activity, whether you find it relaxing or stimulating or whatever.

But don't do it if you're bloody mindedly obsessed with the end goal to the point you're getting stressed just playing the game or reading this sub.

Let's say your idea is that within the game a sausage needs to be thrown at the moon. Now if you then made a post saying that and no further info then I'd say it was irrelevant and stupid. But if you shared the same idea and explained why you thought that, how you would obtain a sausage, and how that would have an effect then you would have a fully coherent idea and people would be likely to follow it.

I'm just saying critiquing is not the only way to validate a theory as you put it. Critiquing is not even a proper way to validate anything. Critiquing can be useful but not as useful as a test.   Edit: also a proper critique would never hurt someone's feelings anyways, as long as the person presenting the theory isn't overly sensitive and the critique is an actual critique in that it is helpful and doesn't include any personal attacks."
chiliadmystery,3ajcxf,quiveringpussyfart,2,Mon Jun 22 17:33:54 2015 UTC,"Fair, however when I spoke of validating I meant validating beyond aspects covered in the theory, when I test and I can recreate aspects of the theory but find no way forward from there I come to critic in order to encourage the author of the theory to put forward ideas to advance the theory to a point where we can call it valid.   The example Id put forward is the gallery paintings theory, I can drive to all those locations but my critic would be now what? There is no where to go from there, just an semi-apparent link to a few spots on the map."

chiliadmystery,3aj1ju,The1Brad,3,Sun Jun 21 02:49:01 2015 UTC,What if Madrazo's house is the cracked egg due to the fact you rip it in half. Also it is the start of Franklins debt from mike.

As already said by /u/gazzy82 he collects aztec stuff, and the interior off his house is still in PC versions to hack into, maybe their was something else to see in there? subsequently, could this heist be coming to the suture single player DLC if its important?"
chiliadmystery,3aj1ju,KillaPam,2,Mon Jun 22 09:55:59 2015 UTC,Could be. The space ship parts had an Aztec like appearance about them.

Chinese people have a belief that if an alien does come to earth and does settle down here (if they haven't already), he will try to gain a position of power and lots of money. Madrazo doesn't look like an Alien, but he does sort of have the same figure as Ma. Very wealthy, powerful with everything he does. We should spend a small amount of time looking into it."

Numbered guards patrolling the house of a main story mission giver with a lot of connections.  Guards are numbered and have a curious manner of respawning.  Ergo curiosity."
chiliadmystery,3aj1ju,nighthaawk,4,Sat Jun 20 20:17:40 2015 UTC,It is not a baseless claim because nothing is being claimed.  Something has been found and whether or not it is connected with the mystery has yet to be seen.  Which i imagine is the reason it was posted.

chiliadmystery,3aj1ju,Saint_Sin,5,Sat Jun 20 20:30:56 2015 UTC,"Do you know how the DON'T tie into the mystery? Its seems like there's enough here to at least theorize about. It also seems like if there isn't an eye, a UFO, or egg plastered on something it tends to get written off as unrelated or unimportant. The mystery is mysterious. So you have to look for things that don't add up and then seek out connections. 5 numbered guards, when killed randomly, only respawn #2. Perhaps 2 was killed out of order and so is the only one to respawn. Or perhaps 2 was the only one killed in order so is the only one to respawn. There's no reason to think that this is IT, but it could be a step along the way."

Do not be confused by ""set_script_as_no_longer_needed"". All this does is tell the engine that the ""startup"" script does not need to access the script anymore. It does not kill it.  There is one thing that would prevent the script from starting, and that is this line.   ""if (is_bit_set(Global_86838.imm_6711.imm_99.imm_208[iVar0], iVar1))""   iVar0 and iVar1 are dependent on the index of the script. The index of the script is stored in iVar2 and is incremented for each script in the list. I'm assuming ambient_solomon is script #33 (it is last on the chain). Here is the code to determine iVar0 and iVar1;      if (iVar2 <= 31)     {         iVar0 = 9;         iVar1 = iVar2;     }     else     {         iVar0 = 10;         iVar1 = iVar2 - 32;     }   That would make iVar0 = 10 and iVar1 = 1;  This is the same as :    is_bit_set(g_SAVE_DATA. FLOW_STRUCT. MF_CONTROLS_STRUCT. MF_CONTROL_BITSETIDS[10], 1)   These are the mission controller flow flags and determine whether or not the mission should actually start. It is absolutely possible that this flag is never set. Though for other cut content I have not seen this level of integration into the game. Harrier, cut heist content, etc. are never referenced inside the scripts. I would also think that after this long and the game coming out on multiple platforms that they would have removed this file had it been completely cut content.  Not to say that the theory is wrong but it does appear the script can be started in game."

I'm sure that the real world version has nothing to do with the GTAV mystery, obviously, so if it's an exact replica and all the lights are aligned, then it's guaranteed to mean nothing at all towards the mystery, if it's completely different, then it might be worth looking into, and looking for patterns like you mentioned you did, but if it's anything like this case, where it's very close to being similar to the real building, but only has a few mismatches, then chances are there's something hidden there. There are many codes that use mismatches in existing patterns to indicate a partial pattern within the grand construct, something like ""This part is a mismatch, that means that this is where the REAL pattern starts"", or something along those lines. Of course, this can't really be generalized since encryption methods vary greatly from one another, but mistmatches a incredibly important to keep an eye out for.

I have no experience in creating video games but this seems plausible. Here is what I found going through the tunnel.  This first set is the hard data nothing altered and how I recorded it in the game going from the bridge (South) side to the North: 1=ON X=Half 0=OFF - 185 Lights Total - The space is where the space in the lights occurs: 1x00101x1x010011x0100x1x1010x1x0110x1x00101x1x010011x0101xx1xx 01xx1x0010011x0100x1x1010x1x0110x1x00101x1x010011xx1 00x1x010x x1x01010x11001001x1x10001xx11001001x1x100010x11001xx1x10100x1x  This Set is the same except all the X's are replaced with 0's 10001010100100110010001010100100110010001010100100110010100100 0100100010011001000101010010011001000101010010011001_000100100 01001010011001001010100010011001001010100010011001001010100010  This set is the same except all the X's are replaced with 1'S 11001011110100111010011110101110110111001011110100111010111111 0111110010011101001111010111011011100101111010011111 001110101 11101010111001001111100011111001001111100010111001111110100111  Here is the possible palandrome with the extra light on the end and cut in half to be easier to compare: 10001010100100110010001010100100110010001010100100110010100100010010001001100100010101001001 100100010101001001100100010010001001010011001001010100010011001001010100010011001001010100010  Not sure it means anything but you can have my data. :)"

chiliadmystery,3agsp6,head_bussin,8,Sat Jun 20 10:38:27 2015 UTC,"The thing about this issue people seem to have with being told their idea was ""discussed already"" is that if it's been discussed already and we haven't come up with anything to really think about it, it's probably been deemed not important. No one is saying don't discuss it further, but as OP it's up to you to bring something new to the discussion.  The real question is not ""why don't we think it's relevant"" but ""why do you think it is relevant.  I'm not trying to give you a hard time, brother brother, I'm just trying to change the victim culture that's trying to get a foothold around here."
chiliadmystery,3agsp6,lbraud,2,Sat Jun 20 01:20:34 2015 UTC,"Victim culture? Sounds a bit dramatic. I used the observation flair by the way. I just want to get people thinking and discussing this without hearing someone bitch about it already being discussed. Now if I put different flair and tried to act like this was something ground breaking I would expect backlash. Thing is there seems to be a culture of ""that's been discussed"" that has a foothold already. I think DrAidanCox's point was don't dismiss it for that reason only. If someone comes in here and says ""hey guys I just discovered a ufo on Chiliad."" that fucker has it coming. I don't do victimhood. But there is nothing wrong with treading old ground."

In order to solve it WE must come together and try different things so that either 1. We solve it by putting pieces together like an ordinary jigsaw puzzle or 2. Put it together so that when you play it in order like it supposed to be played it will seem like it happens naturally (like the hologram ufo, only happens if you completed the story 100% and to make it seem natural it occurs on any night at 3am in the rain. Glyphs prove that. How was it solved trial and error and OUR theories and tests.) But either way we need everyones thoughts, ideas, theories and comments on the such. No matter how irrational it sounds it all needs examined. If the mystery does not exist then will you please explain the mural, hippy camp and 2 of the glyphs for me? I would love to understand!"

The only logical explanation is that we did something wrong and threw away the idea. It's got to be something we already did, just with the wrong conditions. We've literally done almost everything. We either need to backtrack severely, and test old ideas (ESPECIALLY WITH UPDATES BEING ADDED IN) or accept it's going to be DLC. We are writing the tract, that's the main reason to go back, they are possibly using our ideas."
chiliadmystery,3adhoe,Huge_Dabs,2,Fri Jun 19 15:08:25 2015 UTC,"Heres what it boils down to.  Some users do use the search. They gather info from other users and threads, then elaborate on why it needs further attention. They put in the required work to try and revive an old idea.  But most users do not use the above approach, they blindly post old info while adding nothing concrete to it. Its bullshit to say the least, and if they are new to reddit then they obviously used a search engine to find this reddit. So searching is not above and beyond them.   And then, lets get on the topic of the rules posted on ghe right hand side of the page. No reason to not read them before posting.   Users who do their homework and take the time to search, gather, and apply new info to old ideas will continue to get respect and those who choose the easy path will continue to get downvoted, blasphemed, and criticized.

chiliadmystery,3adhoe,head_bussin,4,Fri Jun 19 11:03:18 2015 UTC,"We're all sick of a lot of things on this sub. But none of us get to have the sub the way we want it. So just get used to seeing ""this has been discussed already"".  ( Also, in a great bit of irony, this type of post has popped up numerous times in the past couple years. So your disdain for ""this has been discussed already"".....has been discussed already.) To the people suggesting that old hunters should post links to the old post- We're not here to do the work for you. I'm happy to sum up what I can remember of an old post for you, but if you're posting some retarded ass 2 year old idea that's been posted a billion times before, it's on you to deal with the Reddit search. When I need my license renewed, I go wait in line at the DMV, I don't get someone to do it for me. Like it or not, if an idea is super old and people are insisting it's a dead end, it probably is. This game has been out way too long with ALOT of people testing and offering theories. Plus, some theories are just easy to debunk. Like, sorry BTTF fans, but even if we could get the train to push the space docker to 88 MPH, there isnt a secret 1992 version of San Andreas hidden on this disk. Debunked. We have technically solved this mystery. The mural points to the UFO's around the map. That being said, there is ALOT of other strange, out of place clues in this game that could point to something else. The problem is we've had access to these clues since day 1, and they STILL havent led us to any proof that there's anything more to this easter egg than the UFOs.    Now before everyone blows up on me for that last one, I'm not saying there's no further mystery or nothing left to find. I'm saying that we've had two years to get at least some concrete proof that there's an end in sight for this mystery- not just the UFOs. But we havent. And i think thats why its so easy for some people to just shoot down ideas because they've been discussed already. Testicles. That is all."

Who has right to debunk something? Is the mystery solved? How can you debunk something when you have an unsolved mystery? Are you sure you tried every way possible or your story is right? What if a debunk topic only works if the rest of mystery is right? We cant debunk anything until the mystery is solved until then all information is speculation and guess work
chiliadmystery,3adhoe,deltaninethc420,2,Fri Jun 19 11:11:38 2015 UTC,"Point on the debunk. What if the 3am glyph was tried way before 100% on chiliad and nothing occured because you needed 100% first. What if 3am glyph was thrown out as 3am? Noone would ever look there at 3am again because its been 'debunked' therefore you would have never found the ufo at 3am in the rain! We be standing on chiliad looking at nothing scratching our heads like where did we go wrong? This goes with anything debunked in the game/mystery. Unless you have 110% proof not just people's word of mouth by their tests that they have tried, something simply cannot be classified as debunked. There are many ways things can go just cause 100 people tried it multiple ways and failed does not mean it doesnt go here! Maybe try 100 other ways first."
chiliadmystery,3adhoe,deltaninethc420,2,Fri Jun 19 11:20:04 2015 UTC,"I shudder to think the potential solution has been ""discussed already""   That's actually a really good reason to read the wiki and search old topics before posting.  If people are going to post about old topics, I think they should link to previous posts to show that they know what they're talking about, and then clearly explain how their post adds new ideas to the conversation."
chiliadmystery,3adhoe,SuperMaruoBrassiere,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:13:59 2015 UTC,"The reddit search function is horrible, so it makes sense that stuff gets reposed often."

chiliadmystery,3adhoe,kultrazero,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:49:52 2015 UTC,I think a good way round this would be to ban the words 'use the search bar' and encourage search bar prolific users to actually post the link to the previous discussion instead.
chiliadmystery,3adhoe,Squaremup,7,Fri Jun 19 11:15:55 2015 UTC,"Not going to happen. Read the rules. This isn't /r/trees or /r/funny where it's a game to see who can collect the most meme points, we're trying to solve a mystery and there is a learning curve. We used to know this as a sub, but too many people think this sub is a feelgoodery on some everybody gets a trophy day bullshit.  If someone tells you to use the search bar, instead of getting pissy and starting a pointless argument out of defensiveness, explain why you feel your post merits discussion. Too much butthurt in here lately that wouldn't happen if we were all a little more mature and willing to swallow our pride.  No one else should be expected to do your homework for you.  Edit: oh the irony. Make a point about how this sub isn't about collecting points; get gilded. Lol ...thanks, kind stranger."
chiliadmystery,3adhoe,GiantSquidd,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:35:53 2015 UTC,"No one told me to use the search bar I just see it posted a lot, some people do actually reference the old content in their 'use the search bar' replies and I personally think that makes for a better, more relevant comment and it's also a good way to recycle good points that other people may have missed. Given the sheer magnitude of the mystery you can't possibly expect people (people who do this for fun might I add) to know and remember everything they've read in here, that's what the wiki is for but then that wouldn't make for much discussion on a daily basis, information traffic is high in this sub, no point suppressing it, even if it is second hand. I know when I log on I always check 'new' so I'm always up to date and seeing links to old posts doesn't bother me one bit, seeing 'use the search bar' gets old fast.   Edit; Ive been here for a while now to the ones calling me out for being new, this sub made me create a reddit account almost a year ago and I'd been browsing here quietly a good time before that"

It is to avoid situations like this:  Strange box at the altruis camp   .....  .....

chiliadmystery,3adhoe,OleMno,2,Fri Jun 19 09:42:59 2015 UTC,You forgot overuse of 'Jesus toast'... man I hate that.
chiliadmystery,3adhoe,nemprime,2,Fri Jun 19 15:32:19 2015 UTC,"...and yet we mods get hated on for removing obvious Jesus toast posts from people who can't accept that the hunt has been around for almost two years before they showed up.   We just can't please the newer users without pissing off the people who've been here from the start, and so many of the newer users think they should have the same experience we did when the hunt was new, and get upset when they get told that their ""discoveries"" are old add the hunt itself. You guys should see some of the hate we get in the mod mail...  When I started I wanted to catch up, now everyone seems to want us all to start at square one because they found out about the hunt."
chiliadmystery,3adhoe,GiantSquidd,2,Fri Jun 19 18:24:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah. And a lot of the new users who post obviously old information, without searching first, don't seem to stay here very long anyway. They make a few redundant posts, and when they don't get the points they wanted, they leave. :-/  But this isn't just a Reddit or chiliadmystery problem. In any kind of conversation, here or in real life, if you jump in and start talking out of your ass with zero knowledge of the subject being discussed, people are going to think you're a fool.  It's up to the poster. Do they genuinely want to contribute to the conversation? Or are they just posting because they want the attention? It's impossible to have a conversation with someone who refuses to listen to anyone else."

If you go up and then fly til you're the hippie camp, that's where the UFO is!""

Not only that, but it was SA they included with GTA V's PC preorder.     I'm glad I'm not the only one that finds it odd that CJ has all but disappeared from the face of the earth. Wasn't he supposed to go on a world tour with Big Smoke after SA? Yet not a shred of Big Smoke's music has survived, even on the Classics station. Other than the whole ""separate universes"" theory, there's little to no reason (other than time/budget) that they wouldn't have at least ONE track made by one of the only canon music stars in the series."

There was a tattoo on trevor with a date of when he died or something and someone else calculated it out that M must be over 40.  Still worth a shot, like wait until you are on the last delivery to the altruists but go there in hang out form with all 3 characters lol, I would assume that if it works it's going to be a lot easier to clear the camp in a specific way (like stun gunning the leader and leaving him alive, but killing everyone else)."

It's why you see a lot of invisibility when you no-clip the world, so the fact that the RON sign glows blue is still rather mysterious."

chiliadmystery,3aahzv,head_bussin,2,Thu Jun 18 15:52:12 2015 UTC,i just walked/jogged up from the east near the weed compound. i had a new moon (barely a sliver).   started my trek at 20:00 and had about 1/2 hr to spare once i got to the top. i guess i'll keep trying this every night until i find a quarter moon.   only observation was that dark clouds did indeed start forming about half way up.

They are the ""rain"" glyph, and a faded one. Surely you need the ""Mountain"" glyph, and the ""3"" glyph, which are on the right.

chiliadmystery,3aahzv,head_bussin,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:49:18 2015 UTC,"Because you logically progress through the mystery from the left to the right.  You enter the mystery not knowing anything on the left of the mural, you figure out the clues(the conditions to trigger the UFO) which gives you the UFO, and you use the same kind of thoughts to figure out the other side of the mural to get the jetpack, but once you have the jetpack you are done hence the exit only on the right side of the moutain. I highly doubt the triggers needed for the second half(jetpack) would allow someone to accidentally find the jetpack(which would solve the second half of the mystery) before triggering the UFO's(solving the first half). If that makes any sense.  There doesn't need to be an entrance on the jetpack side, because you are entering it from the left side after you finish the UFO trigger."
chiliadmystery,3aahzv,MaudesBailBonds,0,Thu Jun 18 18:52:37 2015 UTC,"But when you say trigger the ufo ""side"" (trigger the ufo) we need conditions from the other side (jetpack side).?  like rain and top of the mountain.. :/ i like your theory, but there are some things that don't fit to it"
chiliadmystery,3aahzv,MaudesBailBonds,2,Thu Jun 18 23:15:45 2015 UTC,"no, he is saying the 2 glyphs (2 x's) on the left show 2 conditions which allow the UFO to bleed through which ever paradigm it's in.   once you see the UFO, the jet pack mystery starts so to speak, if you follow the UFO down.   there is only one entrance/exit on the right side. since we read from left to right he considers that an exit."

Then I converted what they have marked as a ""partially lit"" into an OFF (0). So the lights are either ON (1) or OFF (0), like binary code. They did not make much sense going in south to north direction, so I tried it the other direction and got these results. Which are better, but may not mean anything.  Also they used this system for data collection: ""off, partially lit, and fully lit. Assigning the values 0, 1, and 2, respectively.""   Binary uses: On or Off. One or Zero. So I converted it accordingly.  Resource: http://www.ascii-code.com/"
chiliadmystery,3ab7v4,teedoe,2,Thu Jun 18 18:18:11 2015 UTC,So do the lights change sequence ever or are they constant? There may be more than one set or string of code at different times.

chiliadmystery,3ab7v4,MaudesBailBonds,0,Fri Jun 19 03:18:01 2015 UTC,"So by eliminating the stuff that doesn't fit your narrative you're left with something that doesn't get anyone any closer to solving ""the mystery""?  This is like Jesus toast within Jesus toast."

chiliadmystery,3ab7v4,WarBob,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:36:11 2015 UTC,Yeah but you arbitrarily decided what some of the lights mean. Have you tried with the doom lights being on?  ...It seems to me that there are three options that you decided need to be pared down to two to fit your idea.
chiliadmystery,3ab7v4,GiantSquidd,2,Thu Jun 18 19:47:22 2015 UTC,"To be fair Squidd's sort of right. You did pick and choose a little when presenting this series of steps.  It's also relatively easy to make these sorts of things about anything and is also the reason why conspiracy theorists use this kind of thinking to promote things in their favor.  Example:   The three main character's names are MICHAEL, TREVOR and FRANKLIN.  If we convert the letters of their name into numbers (with A=1, B=2, etc), we get:  MICHAEL = 13-9-3-8-1-5-12  TREVOR = 20-18-5-22-15-18  FRANKLIN = 6-18-1-14-11-12-9-14  I then add those numbers together to create a number representing that character made up of a numeral alphabet of their name, we then get:  MICHAEL = 51  TREVOR = 98  FRANKLIN = 85  Putting those numerical alphabet representations together then converting back into letters becomes:  519885 = ESHHE  ESHHE = SHE HE  ""She"" and ""He"", both the male and the female. This is the embodiment and root of life itself. Coincidence?   As for anagrams; if you shove enough consonants and vowels into a generator you can make virtually anything that sounds relevant to what you're looking for.  However the bigger question you need to ask in all this, is why require you to do all of that just for the word ""RIDDLED"" (or ""THE RIDDLED"" as it were) when it doesn't direct you anywhere or take you any further?  An answer intended to be deciphered in such an elaborate and out of the box way (that hasn't previously been hinted at to do so) would likely result in an actual directional clue instead of something vague or neutral.  Like Squidd sort of touched upon though, more importantly is the ""Q"" and ""2"". Either the letters fit or they don't. You can't just drop them to support the other word, otherwise the anagram theory falls flat from choosing to ignore things that don't fit the proposed outcome."
chiliadmystery,3ab7v4,WarBob,2,Thu Jun 18 20:13:28 2015 UTC,"Im not trying to prove anything, im showcasing something i found interesting.   Is your ""SHE HE"" example a joke?  Considering how complicated this mystery seemingly is, i dont see it too farfetched to look into binary, ascii and anagrams.  This is the sort of thing anyone with an internet connection and some sense could test in 5 minutes.   I don't know what ""RIDDLED"" means, hence why i look to the community for some ideas. Sorry i didn't provide a conclusive answer for you.   Regarding dropping letters in the anagram, i did mention that there are lot of other symbols that could potentially make some sort of sense. We also need to see if the lights change. I don't believe there are any golden rules with anagrams, no reason Rockstar couldn't make the player choose select characters. Also, there really aren't that many consonants and vowels having been shoved in, only one letter and number left behind."
chiliadmystery,3ab7v4,GiantSquidd,2,Thu Jun 18 20:57:45 2015 UTC,"I don't believe there are any golden rules with anagrams,   If you exclude letters, it's more than likely wrong, and the more letters there are, the harder it is to pick out a pattern and that makes it less likely to ever be decided since you could make it say just about anything.   There are rules to decoding anagrams or else they wouldn't really work effectively as cryptography."
chiliadmystery,3ab7v4,dwlater,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:51:12 2015 UTC,"No worries. This is a forum for discussion and debate of course, heh.  The example wasn't a joke though. It's a very similar process to the one you used to some extent to arrive at your ""RIDDLED"" word.  I personally disagree with this submission, but you're also welcome to your view and I'm sure others may find it interesting."

There's loads of ancient mythology in the game and I enjoy a nice education lesson time to time. I love posts like this..honestly gta has already taught me so many things about the world, society and life itself. Rockstar hid something here very deep and its going to take a lot of teamwork to uncover the greatest video game mystery of all time!

Check this plot from a previous DMA/R* game (Space Station Sillicon Valley) :   The game's storyline revolves around a space station designed as a ""technologically advanced amusement park"" and home to numerous animals. In the year 2001, it was launched and vanished seven minutes later. Thought to have disappeared forever, it reappears in the year 3000, and its designer, Professor Cheese, mysteriously vanishes upon an excursion to the station. Following this, a duo of ""Heroes for Hire"" are dispatched to investigate. Danger Dan and his robotic partner Evo, a ""super-intelligent, self-evolving robot"" (the end result of the Silicon Valley experiment) arrive to find that over 1000 years, the animal cargo had evolved and merged with the station's technology; examples include an electronically powered fox with motorized wheels and a steam-powered hippopotamus. Throughout the course of the game, the space station is on a collision course with Earth, and it is the player's mission to save all of humanity. At the end of the game, Evo arrives at the control room in the center of the station. He confronts the Evil Brain, who is fascinated by Evo's abilities and wants to keep him to complete the Station's collection of robotic animals. The Brain believes that Evo's powers can lead him to domination of the galaxy, claiming that ""with your body and my mind, we can rule the stars"". The Brain threatens to fire his ""Doomsday-o-Matic shrinkray"" at the Earth. Evo easily defeats the Brain with his laser-vision, but is unable to stop the Space Station from spinning out of control. The station finally collides with earth, landing in New York Harbor. In the process, all of the robotic animals escape from the station. Evo (now fully constructed) must run around New York City, searching out and terminating all of the animals before they break free to terrorize all of Earth.  I think they re-write the same story if a fight between two views which want to recreate a new map of the stars. As ancient indians etc. They repeat the same story again and again, ""rock stars""."

As for the door, imagine finding the trigger to open it, discovering the jetpack inside and boom you have a little run way straight out in front of you out of the cable car station, down on to the scaffolding then up up and away.. its like its made to be the jetpack station, I can imagine once you've been awarded with it, it's a bit like the submarine, you have to return to its spawn point to collect it, not like, in the weapon wheel or as a special vehicle in your garage.

I also saw a theory that said that we need to find three things at three locations, ranging from 1:00-3:00 AM. The three places are the summit of Chiliad, the hippie camp, and the Zancudo bunker. Once we see all three things in that specific order, we get a ""prize.""  We have found Chiliad's 1:00, which is the spiderweb. Chiliad's 2:00 has not been found. The 3:00 is the Chiliad UFO.   We have not yet discovered any of them at the hippie camp. My speculation is that we have to find shadows on the ground at 1:00, 2:00, and 3:00 to find the prize. Why shadows? Because shadows are pretty much one of the main things to see at the hippie camp, in my opinion.  And, at Zancudo, we found all three things. At 1:00, the outer lights appear above the bunker. At 2:00, the middle lights appear. And at 3:00, the center lights appear. When you watch all 3 appear, our prize is the light show."

chiliadmystery,3aa3cn,Bipolaricecap,3,Thu Jun 18 12:48:38 2015 UTC,"To be fair I hate dumb posts as I've made aware in the past. but I'd say this has a spark of logic too it and whilst I think it's unlikely, It's also not a terrible idea.   There's always that thing iir where people claim to have seen aliens or other paranormal things and then casually mention they were off their tits which suddenly makes their claims ridiculous. I'd say it's unlikely though as the bellend who's arguing with you like a spoilt child pointed out that the characters would probably sober up before you got there, unless mabey you get drunk in trevs trailer and leave a helicopter or buzzard outside. Don't forget aswell frank and Mike can smoke weed and in character change cutscenes Trevor smokes something (meth I'm guessing), Although I'd say deinately say that it would be too far for the weed but mabey if you can quickly head over to trevs heli pad you may just get too the top before it wears off. As I say I doubt it's likely to go anywhere but hope you can use this in you research."

chiliadmystery,3aa3cn,nighthaawk,-7,Thu Jun 18 15:27:47 2015 UTC,I think what you wrote is dumb. You can't drive drunk to Chiliad you'll sober up before even getting halfway there.

Remember, we can still see the UFO after entering a cheat."
chiliadmystery,3aa3cn,k-i-ll,-4,Thu Jun 18 15:49:00 2015 UTC,Hahahaha even more of a reason this post is useless. Yeah we can still see the UFO after cheating but achievements are blocked. Clearly a way of Rockstar telling us yeah you can use cheats but you're not gonna get achievements.   Of course the cheats haven't stopped any of the gameplay functions but that also does not mean that Rockstar intended for us to use cheats.   If this is the answer to all we've been looking for why would Rockstar insist on us using cheats? What about the people with no internet access or access to cheat codes?  This post is dumb.
chiliadmystery,3aa3cn,DopeBoy187,2,Thu Jun 18 16:12:16 2015 UTC,"Since when did this count as an achievement? If the mystery was blocked by cheats we wouldn't see the UFO, simple as that, unless you're saying the UFO isn't mystery related?"

chiliadmystery,3a44cy,reoze,2,Wed Jun 17 04:12:14 2015 UTC,"QQ; Do you also break open the installed files? We never get any info on things off the disk. Im guessing a messy file gets exploded into the HDD, then built directly on the HDD? This would mean you cannot really read its contents on the disk"
chiliadmystery,3a44cy,gbajere,3,Wed Jun 17 09:37:26 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell, either the entirety of ""disk 1"" or ""disk 2"" gets installed, one disk has all of the audio files, the other has all of the ""game"" files. What we're seeing in the rpf's are the files themselves that get 'exploded'  Old windows games used to do the same exact thing, install game files to disk, stream audio from the CD."

I wouldn't use that term to describe the process at all.   It's simply just a copy, there's some slight chance that the files will be decompressed and then stored into some container format that sony or microsoft built for their consoles, but this is honestly a bit out of my depth."

chiliadmystery,3a44cy,gbajere,2,Thu Jun 18 04:26:25 2015 UTC,"No thats not how it works, at all. That would mean the steam version is sorcercy (no disk). Usually the game files are compressed in archives and get extracted onto your drive, sometimes theyre not even archived and you can practically play the game directly from the disk without installing it (Dark Messiah shipped like that). Im also not quite sure what you mean with a ""messy file"" getting ""exploded"" onto the drive?  Ontopic, can you link us to some excamples of ""shock coding""? I cant find anything, neither vague nor solid, nothing."
chiliadmystery,3a44cy,iAmSmokey,2,Wed Jun 17 10:26:13 2015 UTC,"I mean messy as in people cannot read it. Its just a 'blob' of data.

chiliadmystery,3a44cy,gbajere,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:20:25 2015 UTC,"Oh yes thats right, and when they say ""On the disk"" theyre just refeering to the game files (the ones we all can open with OpenIV right now), its kind of used in the wrong way since ""On the disk"" actually refeers to the unpatched game files, so basically version 1.0 of said game."

We checked the most likely places for the files were looking for, but considering how convoluted the chilliad mystery is, the way they hid the files may be too. Forinstance they could have put them in the update of an update of an update of something were not interested in, so until we checked every file in every folder in every archive there is no way to be 100% sure, and that could take a while."

chiliadmystery,3a0vhl,ArizonaKatie,12,Tue Jun 16 10:22:33 2015 UTC,"Also,  forgot to mention:  The sstv and numbers broadcasts from off the coast of Paleto Bay is very strange and has to be relevant. There are two images,  one of earth from space,  and the other from the view of seemly an apache attack helicopter hud depicting an oval shape that is too dark to make out.   Something I have never seen anyone cover is the numbers section of the broadcast. It is extremely hard to determine all of them but they must serve some purpose,  just how the sstv section of it serves the purpose to make a picture."
chiliadmystery,3a0vhl,nighthaawk,9,Tue Jun 16 10:32:53 2015 UTC,"Because as far as I know it was never really proven to actually exist.   Though I agree with the Barry thing. There are definitely a lot of clues hidden in plain sight in the cutscenes, and after paying close attention to the camera's pans and framing they become much more obvious. Maybe putting together a list of cutscenes with potential clues might help piece things together."
chiliadmystery,3a0vhl,nighthaawk,4,Tue Jun 16 12:30:23 2015 UTC,"I personally have heard one of the broadcasts myself,  not sure which one as I didn't perform sstv as its on the 360. Many users on gtaforums have performed it however and got the same picture but different quality translations due to using different programs for the sstv analysis. It is located where the xs are on the UV map late at night,  but not every night.  It's pretty tricky to get to happen because there aren't any landmarks to tell you if your in the right spot but it is there.   The difference in the recording quality will also give better picture quality obviously as the modulation within the audio signal is much clearer to interpret. The background ambient noise will also mess with it.   Some users have also said the video was fake because in one video a player was not driving the boat.  However much like if you leave a car on and leave the door open,  you can hear the radio still but quieter. But because on boats you are actually right next to the radio after getting out it retains higher volume versus outside of a car (the realism of this game!)."
chiliadmystery,3a0vhl,dwlater,6,Tue Jun 16 13:04:58 2015 UTC,"Are you able to link to these pictures? Preferably more than one showing the difference in the quality as you said. Not saying I don't believe you, I just thought this would have been much bigger news if it was proven true."

Someone who's been here as long as you claim should know we'd need proof of something like that, and it makes me wonder what you were really banned for.

Even more interesting, the speed at which the shadow moves is dependant on which direction you are walking. Try walking in a little circle - you should see it speed up, slow down, speed up...  I think it's just a peculiarity with the way the game engine fakes shadows.  It looks good, until you look too close."
chiliadmystery,3a0vhl,dwlater,3,Tue Jun 16 22:24:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this. Wasn't sure if it was different on current gen, but this is definitely the way all shadows work in the game on PS3/360.

However it did 'skip' when I looked at the same spot with the sniper, when zooming out the normal view adjusts to that of the sniper.  Also a hearse spawns there at night.  I checked out the surrounding buildings.  The ammunation has a weird writing on it 'parking in front of here' obviously they forgot the 'no' preceding the 'parking' but i couldnt make heads or tails out of this.  The firedep. is so so.

But when I started running toward the mountain, the shadow would retreat from me. All of this happened close to the gate and the barn with the supposed jetpack shape on the door.

chiliadmystery,3a2ijz,gerstec,-2,Tue Jun 16 22:24:00 2015 UTC,"I still think the cracked egg is for the hatch in the ocean. What happens when an egg cracks. It's likely hatching. To me I don't see any other way to symbolize the hatch. A hatchet would be completely different which someone once mentioned. I feel that it has less to do with the egg and more to do with what is happening to the egg. If an egg isn't ""manufacturered"" for sale to be eaten then the egg will hatch as it's natural process. Unfortunately people have confirmed strongly that the hatch's tap code is just a roman GTA4 joke and nothing more. Even more unfortunate is I'm not satisfied by that and believe we have it wrong and did not decipher it correctly."
chiliadmystery,3a2ijz,gerstec,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:43:50 2015 UTC,"Even more so. If it had to only do with an egg I doubt they'd put a crack in it. Unless of course the crack means something. Which I believe it does. ""If the rifles on the wall it's likely to be used""  Edit: for past to present on cracked"

chiliadmystery,3a2ijz,cbxcbx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:48:22 2015 UTC,"That's not how eggs work. They're not altered in a manufacturing process to not hatch, if they are fertilised by a rooster they will hatch. If they are not they are breakfast."
chiliadmystery,3a2ijz,gerstec,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:06:54 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean. But I think you might be thinking way too hard and deep into what it means. There is no evidence in the game that would suggest the egg is for food or for offspring. You are right though when an egg is meant for food it's different from when an egg that is meant for life. The way I look at it is that it is not the egg but the detail of the egg that is the clue. On the mural the first symbol is a UFO. That symbol represents an existing item in the GTA 5 universe. If you were to follow the theme in which the design the first symbol is then the two symbols after are also based upon an item that exists inside the Grand Theft Auto World without modding. So if we look at the first mural symbol and understand its an item we should look at the egg as an item as well. So I asked myself what about the symbol makes it an item that exists in the games universe. My opinion is that the symbol doesn't represent an egg at all it represents what's happening to the egg. That being said if you look at it thinking the crack is the egg about to hatch then the term hatch becomes an item that exists in the universe of the game. I don't find it to be a coincidence that there is a hatch at the bottom of the ocean and when you get close to it you can hear tapping which is like some sort of Morse code. The fact that the UFO symbol symbols in actual item I would think the egg does as well. When you do go to the hatch especially if you found it randomly it's not just a fixture in the games foundation rather it's something that interacts with you. I also ask myself if I was a developer how would I represent a hatch as a symbol without giving away exactly what it is and to make people figure it out. What else could be used to represent a hatch? A hatchet wouldn't as it is a smaller form of an axe and has nothing to do with anything but some sort of tool. By using an egg with a crack it gives the ability for people to decipher it and understand what that crack is thus being the hatch. When people found the hatch they heard tapping sounds and were able to decipher it. I believe that the deciphered means more than we think because right now people think its a joke of Roman asking Niko to go bowling I believe it's not just a joke easter egg but possibly another clue or the symbol was made to help find the hatch just like the UFO is used to show us there is a UFO. Now that we have the first symbol solved we kind of know the theme in which the symbols are. The UFO symbol symbolizes an item and I believe the rest do as well. It's kind of like the UFO symbol is there to show us how to work the rest of the symbols. What I'm trying to say is, here we have an egg with a crack and if you think of it as a hatching egg then it can possibly represent the hatch. I believe the crack represents a hatching egg and I don't find it to be a coincidence that there is a hatch in the middle of the ocean. I truly believe that the egg represents the hatch so people would look for it and when they find it they hear a code in which they have to decipher and like I said I believe that the cyper means more than we think."

I say this because there is obviously so much with this mystery that doesn't seem finished but isn't in the game. Then the release of online seemed to have been underestimated by R* and obviously delayed quite a lot. It even seems they prematurely used the ol' Shawn Fonteno marketing strategy where they had him make teaser posts of story mode DLC in December of 2014. Now with heists finally out and online under control Shawn Fonteno has again made another Instagram post and R* is finally confident in getting their DLC out in time. And now that they're ready to release they're DLC BAM, they start acknowledging the mystery again as we can see here. So IMO it looks like R* is ready to release their mystery completing DLC like they'd originally planned."

I always expected it to be a download, but i was really hoping that it would be a download that was already made and we just had to trigger it. Waiting for 2 years, whist effectively wasting our time is a bit of a low blow.  Sad thing is that if this is the case, Rockstar can never do another mystery hunt again. No one would put effort into it, and we would all just wait for DLC again. Only way to get people to hunt would be to come out and publicly say there is something to be found from day one."

chiliadmystery,39xenh,KilroytheKilljoy,10,Wed Jun 17 15:33:09 2015 UTC,"This topic reminds me of something I mentioned in a previous thread as showing logical evidence of there still being a mystery.  Main reasons why I think there is still something to solve:   If there is no mystery this is the most epic troll in video game history, and because of that it would create a lot of bad faith between r* and the community It's actually cheaper to just make the damn mystery Easter egg than to risk losing intangible amounts of money pissing people off and losing customers. If there is no mystery and they ever try to do another one in the future no one will do it because the assumption is they are just trolling a$$hats again, it's just not worth it for them Too many things that are not proven 100% yet. ie. The hamburger sign, scientists at satellite dish, bunker elevator, hidden room in the mural shack, the IAA base on the road to humane labs, the entire freaking observatory, and the best example, the mural itself.   One thing I can't rule out is if it's been available since day one or if this is all pointing to future dlc like the zombie shit in RDR...but this would suck and would piss people off.  The basic point i'm trying to make is that it's really in r* best business and monetary interests to have a dope ass mystery for us to solve, if they didnt put one in the game there is absolutely no way they would benefit from that situation. You could argue ""well they can eat that cost easily"" but think about it like this, in business why risk losing money especially when it's mad easy to stop it from happening..I bet almost any one of r*'s devs could build/write a jet pack by themselves in a few days @ 8 hours a day, they have hundreds of devs, why would you not do it?? it's the difference of attracting more mystery hunters(aka more customers) next time around if it's a really good EE versus pissing off the entire gaming community..I bet even non mystery hunters would find it really damn shady if this is an epic troll..I know I sure as hell would, it shows how much they care about the paying fans that keep them in business.  Edit: spacing my god reddit"

Sure we found them randomly like a week after release but R* couldnt have known how we would find them, and the mural is a pretty obvious guide for it. The only reason the mural-is-already-solved theory is discredited is because of the other strange shit like the bunker elevator, etc."
chiliadmystery,39xenh,Chilltyperiod,16,Mon Jun 15 23:39:49 2015 UTC,the mural-is-already-solved theory never explains   the lightining bolts the labyrinth like lines the crack in the egg the inconsistencies of the glyphs locations (no glyphs at zancudo or paleto) 2/5 mountain glyphs have no obvious meaning the sand glyph   it is discredited because it has holes.

That and I have to argue that most of the players of GTAV at least know of the mystery.

chiliadmystery,39xenh,De_Doctor,6,Tue Jun 16 08:16:14 2015 UTC,Thats tinfoil hats plural . The tinfoil hats are real .I have several just in case they find out which one i am wearing.
chiliadmystery,39xenh,djdat,4,Tue Jun 16 11:18:42 2015 UTC,"What are those two things to either side of the saucer, trees? Fireworks?  Also why is there only one fleur de lis?"
chiliadmystery,39xenh,MrMrMilhouse,4,Mon Jun 15 16:42:12 2015 UTC,"If anything, the fleur de lis seems to be pointing at a specific location on Chiliad. At least that's what I'm seeing... Does seem totally out of place though."
chiliadmystery,39xenh,Allofyouandus,4,Mon Jun 15 21:31:08 2015 UTC,"Thats exactly what im seeing as well, like its saying wait till you see the ufo then go that a way"
chiliadmystery,39xenh,MrMrMilhouse,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:58:27 2015 UTC,that is an interesting interpretation. Where is it pointing though?
chiliadmystery,39xenh,MrMrMilhouse,5,Mon Jun 15 22:08:38 2015 UTC,IDK. Maybe here : http://imgur.com/gallery/yfk6OEr/new Wherever that is...
chiliadmystery,39xenh,MrMrMilhouse,4,Mon Jun 15 22:54:28 2015 UTC,I think this is saying to go to that spot on chiliad when the UFO is up maybe during the timer and maybe we'll find an entrace? looks like a more clear version of the mural in a way
chiliadmystery,39xenh,Huge_Dabs,3,Tue Jun 16 06:21:19 2015 UTC,This whole section of the map/mural/diagram is the most enigmatic to me. Just doesn't make any sense. Like it screams circular logic. Too many lines that don't need to be there. Imgur
chiliadmystery,39xenh,MrMrMilhouse,5,Mon Jun 15 23:05:15 2015 UTC,"Personally I think thers an entrance to the inside of the mountain, but it's being cloaked to loook like shrubbery or a cliff face."

chiliadmystery,39xenh,A_Millennium,3,Mon Jun 15 17:09:16 2015 UTC,"Considering the Fleur de lis stands for Perfection, Life and Light it could represent the setting Sun. Sun setting in the West and all that."

chiliadmystery,39xenh,A_Millennium,3,Mon Jun 15 22:10:43 2015 UTC,"Yah actually looking more into the fleur de lis I am actually getting the same idea. Also since the the symbol is on a sniper rifle as a design I would say it has something to do with ""coat of arms"" in England and France as a reference or nod. It was also used as a way to identify in battle (what idk, assuming rank) but evolved into a system of social status after 1483. That information was pulled from http://www.fleurdelis.com/fleur.htm The weirdest part about that Web page is the symbolism section. It talks about the colors used and some of the styles used. Red and blue both are in there. Red(gules) stands for warrior or martyr; military strength, and magnanimity. Blue (azure) stands for truth and loyalty."
chiliadmystery,39xenh,socrates1975,3,Mon Jun 15 22:22:34 2015 UTC,Annnd to back up the coat of arm theory. A lion and dragon are also on the sniper rifle barrel. Both are used in coat of arms/family crests.
chiliadmystery,39xenh,socrates1975,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:31:48 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, below the lion is a crown with 2 arrows, relating to a Kingdom (King) and each kingdom had their own coat of arms or whatever"

chiliadmystery,39xenh,MrMrMilhouse,6,Mon Jun 15 16:47:35 2015 UTC,Could be showing us north?
chiliadmystery,39xenh,MrMrMilhouse,3,Mon Jun 15 16:57:48 2015 UTC,"It does look to be the view of Mt C. from the North side, or NE where the sun rises. I doubt it is much of a clue though and more of a nod or push for us to keep looking."
chiliadmystery,39xenh,crustpunker,2,Mon Jun 15 17:55:01 2015 UTC,"I thought it looked like it was from the south-southwest, and the deer could be roughly the spot where Cletus' hunting mission takes place. If that's the case, the way the fleur de lis is kind of pointing would be north. Fleurs de lis indicate north on compasses."
chiliadmystery,39xenh,myinnertrevor,5,Mon Jun 15 17:58:00 2015 UTC,"Hmm, here was my thinking: Textured side of the engraving (right side) is the shaded side/rocky or tram side of MC. That side faces NW, so you would have to look at it from the north or NE to see this view. Also the fleur-de-lis sort of point to the north."
chiliadmystery,39xenh,alexxerth,4,Mon Jun 15 18:58:12 2015 UTC,circles look like planets...
chiliadmystery,39xenh,gazzy82,2,Mon Jun 15 20:25:55 2015 UTC,"Could be. I was thinking the textured part was Old Man's Crack.  edit; I did a few passes around Mount Chiliad and I'm pretty sure it's being viewed from the south southwest. It really matches up well from there, you can make out the little shoulder parts and the lines on the textured part match up with Old Man's Crack. ...What it means, I have no idea."
chiliadmystery,39xenh,socrates1975,2,Mon Jun 15 20:05:38 2015 UTC,"If you do look at it that way, the elk makes more sense for hunting with Cletus or the Altruist location IF this is actually a clue."
chiliadmystery,39xenh,rsears14,4,Mon Jun 15 21:58:23 2015 UTC,Were these just added to the game? or have they always been there and people are now just finding them?

chiliadmystery,39xenh,MajorMayday,2,Tue Jun 16 21:17:59 2015 UTC,"It's strange that the UFO looks like that...havent seen it represented like that anywhere else, and it certainly doesnt have those 4 black bars in game....could be a stretch, but could this be a clue to the four openings on the observatory doors?"

It's not clear that any two characters riding the lift to Chiliad are involved in unlocking any part of the mystery.  In other posts, which I won't link to but can be searched, it was found: -The dirt bikes may spawn in colours other than the character ones so there doesn't appear to be an intended purpose (yet). -Bringing a character along for the cable car ride doesn't introduce any new dialogue. -It's not necessary to force your friend into the cable car to ride. -Friends brought up to the mountain may glitch, as you saw.  My personal contribution to this line of investigation was having my game autosave (16.0% or thereabouts, after ""Chaos"") bringing both Michael and Franklin for the cable car ride, as Michael. It was not reproducible by other hunters.  All that said it, was recently discovered that after the mission ""Lamar Down"" is completed, a copy of a magazine cover with ""2-for-1"" Chiliad Cable Car voucher appears in Frankin's house. This gave the suspicion, that multiple characters doing the ride is somehow involved, some new life. Welcome and Kifflom!"

They could be eating them or 2. They could simply be inviting them to dinner possibly to convert them or something) Trevor also refers to the altruists as his friends in the mountain.

The stone is on a cliff that faces perfectly West so that the sunset will create this shadow, and there are paintings of sunset all around the camp as a clue to find it.

I got the Jesus Toast effect, too, and before the PC version, when I only had the PS3 version to look at, I was far more convinced that the shadow may have been something, but now the Jesus Toast seems far more likely."

chiliadmystery,39ynvy,deltaninethc420,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:44:53 2015 UTC,"Do a search for ""mirrored pareidolia"".   When you mirror things it makes it pretty easy for our eyes and minds to think we see something. Our brains are really good at picking out faces that aren't there, and mirrored objects are much more likely to produce images that look like thinks that are symmetrical.  The reason the jetpack guy on the rock is so compelling to so many people is because it strongly resembles an image that we all know well and it isn't symmetrical. If the debate was over a symmetrical ufo rock, or an image of just a jetpack with a head on symmetrical view we would have dismissed it along with all the alien faces people have seen in mirrored textures.  Seriously, everyone here should do the same google search to gain a little real life perspective on why so many of us think the jetpack guy is legit."

So the X means not where you have to go only but where you will make people go. As when you draw a map. Think about all of GTA as a double sided thing. The collect map has only one side and ask you to change the light (eyeb+ sun). X are traps because we should understand it symbolizes the moment you name places or make them important.

chiliadmystery,39wpou,Un-trollable,3,Mon Jun 15 12:55:54 2015 UTC,"Many people have speculated that the new SP DLC will depict Lamar and Franklin's adventures before Michael & Trevor showed up. So, it will be a prequel DLC.  Why do people say this?  Well, for starters, it will be really weird to have a DLC featuring all three protagonists as main characters when the last mission of the story gives you the option to kill M & T. Unless this DLC features some time-traveling shenanigans, then it will have to be a prequel...if not, and the story says that M & T moved away/died or something, I think fans will be disappointed because Trevor definitely has a larger fanbase than Franklin.  Secondly, the story was originally supposed to end with Franklin being the one to die, and Lamar taking his place on the character wheel. Many fans think that Rockstar wants to bring Lamar back into the spotlight by making him playable.  Now my opinion? I honestly wouldn't mind a Franklin/Lamar DLC, but I will miss Michael & Trevor a lot. And I think without Michael & Trevor, the story will be very boring. Now I'm not saying GTA: San Andreas was boring, because it definitely wasn't, but this new DLC (if the Franklin/Lamar speculation is correct) will be more like that game, centered around drug dealing, gangsters, etc.   Things that could be added into this DLC that we will like: more Children of the Mountain stuff, more Omega missions, more Space Docker-related stuff, jetpack?

chiliadmystery,39w4gc,SuperMaruoBrassiere,5,Mon Jun 15 07:35:28 2015 UTC,"[ Sorry for the huge post, but there's no way to tl;dr this. Feel free to ask questions if anything I wrote doesn't make sense. I flaired this as ""Meta"" because it is about the Chiliad Mystery as a real world phenomenon, but a lot of it is (obviously, I hope) somewhere between pure speculation and educated guesswork. ]  This link is to GTA V o'clock episode #125 from May 20. I'm posting this because the topic is directly relevant to the mystery hunt and the chiliadmystery sub. And because I think it's strange that the GTAVo'c guys came back to (not) explain their earlier statements with a damage control video.  I'm not posting this to advertise or give them clicks. And I'm not posting this to insult them. But I think we should at least talk about this video.  Basically, in episode #125, James and Iain from GTAVo'c try to explain and justify their earlier ""The Mt. Chiliad Mystery Is Over"" video (from May 13, episode #124: https://youtu.be/m6vpvrBfwGo; discussed here in  Lets_Jump_This_Jump's post: http://redd.it/35ufz5).  The trouble is, they don't directly address the statements they made in episode #124. And they quote posts and comments from this sub in a kinda shady attempt to explain (or distract us from) the content of the earlier video.  In #124, they said they used the ""all interiors mod"" to explore hidden locations on the map. They said that as a result, they discovered there is nothing hidden behind the Mural. That was their evidence for saying the mystery is ""over"" - that there is ""no hidden room"" behind the Mural.  To quote James (starting at about 3:45 in episode #124), ""we can probably say with almost 100% certainty - and I say almost, because there's always a chance - that there is nothing behind the Mt. Chiliad Mural. There's no jetpack in there, there's no hidden room, there's no interior where, if you go in, it will teleport you to something else. There's nothing.""  I have been 'in the mystery' (lol) since 2013, and IIRC, looking for hidden rooms behind the Mural hasn't been a common goal of this hunt since maybe early 2014. It was tried, it was debated, and it was basically debunked. A weird box was found inside the Chiliad shack when the 8th Gen version came out, but that was investigated and quickly dismissed.   James and Iain's implication that the hunt was all about unlocking a secret room behind the mural is (to repeat a phrase I used in a different thread a few days ago) intellectually dishonest. They must have known that this idea was at best a debunked long shot, and at worst complete bullshit.  GTAVo'c episode #124 got a lot of views, and a lot of complaints, here and elsewhere. A week later, in episode #125, they came back to presumably clean up the mess they made. But they just made a lot of irrelevant, straw man excuses instead.  In #125 they make multiple claims to their authority as Chiliad Mystery specialists. James says, ""we've covered quite a lot of the different aspects of the mural. Iain, you've done a lot of guides and easter egg hunts... we have explored the other options...""  And a little later in the episode: ""we've put, like, two years [sic] of our time since the PS3 and XBox 360 versions came out into finding mysteries, and going on the alien hunt, and trying to find the full moon party... finding the hidden grave... there's like so much stuff that we've looked into.""  Of course there is. Of course they've looked into tons of stuff. They are professionals. Obviously they know a lot about this mystery. More than most of the casual hunters here. And making videos about GTAV is their job. I respect that.  But then why would they say that the absence of a room behind the Mural is evidence that the mystery is over? How does that even make sense? Nobody really expected that the jetpack was literally hidden right behind the mural. Like I said, that silly idea was pushed aside a long time ago.  Then they take comments from this sub, out of context, and use them as a kind of smokescreen. They cite Stealth_Pyro's version of the well-repeated '5 Xs = 5 glyphs' theory (https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/36bbpl/a_case_for_the_mural_as_a_geometric_puzzle/crd0dm4)...  And they do a detailed analysis of Paximillian's post about the Chiliad UFO code (http://redd.it/3671if - the post was later removed, but I don't know why).  But the GTAVo'c guys don't address or clarify their assertion that no hidden room behind the mural somehow means there is no Chiliad Mystery.  The closest they come to addressing that is when James says, ""other people said that there not being an interior doesn't matter..."" Then he immediately changes the subject and starts talking about how unreliable no-clipping mods are for testing easter eggs. He doesn't address the problem that the hidden room idea was 1) the central point of their ""Mystery Is Over"" video and 2) a red herring.  Late in episode #125, James says, ""Been doing this for ages. We don't put things out there just to get hits. Like, we've worked on GamesRadar and CVG before it shut, for ages, like that's our job, is doing other things, it's not just GTA related. We're just here to, you know, try and bring the community together about focusing on things, and hopefully give you guys information and entertain you.""    The CVG YouTube account seems to be in bad shape. The last non-GTAV video currently listed on the channel is a Super Smash Bros. video posted on Nov. 19. And since Jan. 7, the only videos posted (or remaining) on the CVG YouTube channel are GTA V o'clock videos. The CVG logo itself doesn't appear on any of the GTAVo'c video thumbnails after March 4.  There was much more diverse content in the CVG YT channel in the 2014 calendar year. The reason for that is probably obvious. CVG closed in early 2015. I don't know why the CVG YouTube channel is still going, but GTA V o'clock is the only series active on that channel now.  If you look at CVG's YouTube page, they got over 65,000 views for the ""Mystery Is Over"" video. In the last 6 months, the ""Heists Preview"" and ""PC Preview"" videos got lots of hits (69,000+ and 351,000+ respectively), but the majority of videos from 2015 have less than 20,000 views. A few of them got less than 10,000 views.  I realize I'm just repeating info most of you already know, but GTAVo'c posted obviously misleading information, and they were rewarded with 65,000 views. That's at least three times the views they got on an average GTA V o'clock video since CVG closed.  Yes, that's pretty bad... maybe even dishonest on their part... but I wonder if that release of dishonest or misleading information was part of a strategy to compensate for corporate restructuring and CVG's closing.  The Chiliad Mystery hunt is often speculative and fantastic, and sometimes completely imaginary. But the video game ""Grand Theft Auto V"" is a real-world, commercial product.  So this video got me wondering... How else has the Chiliad Mystery hunt been perverted, misled, obstructed, or even inspired by false information, or by reports that were influenced more by corporate issues than actual consumer game play and input?  How many of the ideas we've explored (whether affirmative or negative), in countless hours of game play, were based on unreliable or ambiguous comments from professional or otherwise supposedly reputable sources?  To get preachy for a second - this is one of the reasons we need to do searches, research and double- and triple- check our ideas, and try to know where these theories came from.  We always see a lot of old discoveries here. Sometimes those ""discoveries"" can be traced back to bullshit reports made by a throwaway account, or a troll, or even a professional website months and months ago. The GTAV game world is complex, but the billion-dollar corporate gaming  industry that supports, sustains, and feeds this video game easter egg hunt is infinitely more complex.  Can we say with any certainty how many of these discoveries are the result of work by real gamers, consumers, and fans, and how many are top-down instructions from corporate viral marketing strategies? And how much of that top-down information is reliable to begin with? Was GTAV ever a stable story universe? Or has it always been changing? I don't just mean with updates and DLC, but also from changes within the companies that produce, create, promote, and sell this video game.  And who do we look to when we need absolutely reliable confirmation about the GTAV easter egg hunt? Rockstar. But Rockstar isn't talking. And since Rockstar made this game (and made unimaginable, almost unholy profits from it), isn't that a little bit like asking God if God exists? What if Godstar doesn't exist? Or doesn't want to be revealed? Who would answer our questions then?  I hope that doesn't leave us clucking at straws here. GTA V o'clock's weak 'rebuttal' video hints at some of the negotiations going on behind the scenes - negotiations that 99% of the people who bought GTAV will never even imagine. How can we, as Chiliad Mystery enthusiasts, continue to make this experience worthwhile for us?  It's the old chicken-or-the-egg dilemma, but we don't even know which is which. As far as we can tell, some of the possible easter eggs may have already hatched and walked away.  Should we follow them... ?"
chiliadmystery,39w4gc,WarBob,8,Mon Jun 15 07:49:37 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that the quote:   Then they take comments from this sub, out of context   Sums them up entirely.  They honestly don't know anything they haven't regurgitated from either this sub, GTAForums or the other mystery related sources online.  They wait for something small to grasp onto, then use it to fill a video for their channel.  As you say, it's their job. Their prime goal is to create content to gain views and thus earn revenue.  They're not hunters, they're entertainment machines and like any other YouTuber promoting content relating to this mystery, they're not worth following in all honesty."

The only thing I want to be exaplined are the stat checked in every missions script. Cause i'm 100% sure that if a mistery is there you can trigger something only the way you played the entire game. Million of people fouling around the map for 2 years have seen anything in the game and found anything that trigger anything else. The city mural a karma play are our only hope if a mistery is there. You can bet there's nothing to be found under water and on the map. Don't forget what BIG NUMBERS mean. 50 milion players. I bet there's no inch unchecked in the game. By simply fooling around. Can't say there's a mistery but what we are looking for, i'm sure, is a way to make choice in game.

chiliadmystery,39w4gc,diegooo1972,2,Mon Jun 15 17:34:29 2015 UTC,you mean really full 100% or the normal rockstar 100% ? where did you get this number ? That seems too low imho. In any case some people end the game multiple times. This is still a huge exploration.
chiliadmystery,39w4gc,ManiaFarm,2,Mon Jun 15 18:27:22 2015 UTC,"The career criminal trophy, which is the soft 100% trophy is listed as ultra rare 0.3% on PSN. The Solid Gold Baby! trophy (70 gold medals) is also listed as ultra rare 0.2%. I'm guessing a hard 100% is probably around 0.1%"
chiliadmystery,39w4gc,crustpunker,2,Mon Jun 15 18:35:26 2015 UTC,Well this is just psn so on 3 platform i bet we have a solid 1%. Pc players are quite hardcore. We''ll see that. In that case we are still talking about 500.000 people fouling around that is still a  godd number. I'm sure everything is found in game. Just a trigger can be missed only if depend on game choice.
chiliadmystery,39w4gc,420Jamie,2,Mon Jun 15 19:07:01 2015 UTC,"well thats not how percentages work. If you assume that all players play relatively the same from console to console than 0.3% can hold as a general figure across all gtav gamers. It's something closer to 150,000 players with 100% game completion (at 50 million total)."

chiliadmystery,39ul3b,Synysterjesterx,5,Mon Jun 15 05:58:43 2015 UTC,Revolver is part of the Redemption canon. Revolver characters are mentioned in-game and also there are several playable characters from Revolver online.
chiliadmystery,39ul3b,bombings,4,Mon Jun 15 08:36:50 2015 UTC,"Learn to research before you argue.   Rockstar has stated that Red Dead Revolver and Red Dead Redemption do not take place in the same game universe. Although passing references to Revolver may be found in Redemption, in campfire talk for example, these are considered to be references to myths rather than an actual connection between the stories."

While looking through your scrapbook, two images caught my eye:  http://i.imgur.com/INWJVxt.jpg  Specifically the foliage on the UFO. I haven't made any specific trips to it yet so I haven't seen it in-person, only via screenshots. It looks like an odd pattern, relatively similar to the Hippie camp glyphs, though that might just be my mind seeing shapes again. It also might be something as simple as the foliage painted on the ocean floor poking through the geometry of the ship.     Then there's this. I'm interested in it because of the resemblance of Mirror Park to a Heart as well as the time ""10:30."" Looking closer at it, I realize that the ""superior vena cana"" (just going off of what I can read in the screenshot) highlighted in green is where there is a cul-de-sac in Mirror Park that is lit with green lights at night. Mighty suspicious...."

chiliadmystery,39oqmb,kerwasa,2,Sat Jun 13 16:23:40 2015 UTC,"This might be stating the obvious but by looking at the texture map of the space docker symbols you can see paint drips on many of the letters. This would infer the proper orientation/rotation of how they symbols should be read. For example, looking at the original extracted files the glyph at the top left would be rotated 90 degrees clockwise to orient the paint drips downward.  The longest script which has three lines has faint drips on the left hand side, so to be read properly it should be rotated 90 degrees counter clockwise."
chiliadmystery,39oagt,SuperMaruoBrassiere,5,Sat Jun 13 05:00:39 2015 UTC,This has happened to me once and I took it as a glitch.  It was a while back but I think whichever character I was playing spawned like that.  It's something that could easily go unnoticed unless you take a big fall or go on a random rampage.
chiliadmystery,39oagt,arcadia11,7,Sat Jun 13 11:33:01 2015 UTC,"Ok guys. Long time lurker here but very skeptical person. I have to point out i'm in the QA business and when you get 2 independent reports of the same issue you have to give it some thought as a rule. And has anyone seen the bf4 paracel ufo EE? You have to stand on a wind mill and get struck by lightning to ""charge yourself"" and activate the next clue. This stinks of that if its not just a glitch.   Also just because it's not in a script doesn't means it's not hidden deeper in the executable. This is so easy to hide its unreal and can't be discounted. In my opinion r* would be really dumb to try to hide anything important to the mystery in the scripts. *edit: at least the trigger. The stuff already found looks to me as a roadmap as in ""we are on the right track"" but def not the trigger itself. Lol you honestly think they would make it that easy? Just decompile the scripts = jetpack?? Lol at the naivety.   We need to have more people explore this. It's too big of a coincidence.   *edit typo"
chiliadmystery,39oagt,k-i-ll,2,Sat Jun 13 15:43:38 2015 UTC,"First we should see if arcadia11's experience was identical to mine - if he just became invincible, or if he had the same weird reaction to fire too.  Being a skeptical person myself, I'm not going to suggest that this is a clue... but it seems really weird to me that I would only be vulnerable to fire. If I became invincible, I should be invincible to everything, right? Isn't that how the invincibility cheat works, for example?  Like I said before, even as a glitch, this seems really unusual."
chiliadmystery,39oagt,reoze,2,Sat Jun 13 18:56:47 2015 UTC,"The way this game works, EVERYTHING is in the scripts. Right down to the UI and the memory initialization. The exe is just a bridge to the asset files, graphics engine, and physics engine. Almost all other logic is handled inside the scripts."
chiliadmystery,39oagt,k-i-ll,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:40:56 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ. A native call from a script is a call to a function in the executable. Yes scripts may control most logic but when there is a call to a native function we can only guess at the contents of the function due to its name. BUT we don't have a clue what is actually inside that function that could be hidden and only executed on very specific input. There are many examples of passing a secret code to functions that cause entirely different function behavior. Even in the networking space there is port knocking to hide remote back doors. Also you can't discount polymorphism and hiding shit through class overrides and inheritance. Basically all modern languages have built in features to hide or obfuscate things incredibly well. Also we can't discount that when we trigger something it secretly downloads the next part that we have to trigger. Unless we have someone wiresharking every hunt they do along with scanning memory to know when something different then normal is happening we can't know for sure. It could have code hidden in an image that only gets decrypted to memory when we hit some trigger and gets wiped when we restart the game or die so we never know. I know for a fact that some malware never writes itself as a single file to disk. It splits itself into parts. Encrypts each part and stores them in random registry keys across the system that upon next boot finds, decrypts, reassembles and then executes. If anything finds the registry keys they look like gibberish."
chiliadmystery,39oagt,reoze,2,Sun Jun 14 17:57:24 2015 UTC,"Unless we have someone wiresharking every hunt they do along with scanning memory to know when something different then normal is happening we can't know for sure.   There is, there's a whole hacker community dying to find the latest and greatest way to fuck R* over. This includes, packet sniffing, memory injection techniques, modifying the executable, etc, etc.  I personally memdump the game at least 10 times a week looking for different things inside the executable. Every single time I do, I check for things related to aliens, jetpacks, ""secret"", ""ufo"", etc. etc."

You know exactly what your talking about and want to say that. I just hope that my own posts will be as enlightening and logical as yours and don't think I was trying to be a dick by doubting the thing you pointed out about scripts controlling almost all logic! I just was trying to say it's still possible regardless how implausible and thats coming from a skeptic.

Truthfully I used to be in your boat, but my attitude towards that subject changed very quickly. I still had some hope that the answer was hidden in the ""Globals"" but even this is starting to look less and less likely."
chiliadmystery,39oagt,k-i-ll,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:12:18 2015 UTC,"Yea, what really bothers me is just looking at all of the past mysteries in other games that the trigger, if there is one, could be so convoluted it's impossible to discover/trigger by chance.  I just don't like having so many loose ends to this mystery, thats the main thing that gives me hope is that there are just too many things left unexplained, or not proven 100%.   I'm going to keep hoping that there is more too this, that the mystery is just so complex and deep that they will slowly drop hints (like the new sniper engraving with the mountain and UFO) until people make the damn connections and figure it out. To me it feels like we have all or most of the pieces but we just have no clue what to do with them."
chiliadmystery,39oagt,reoze,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:59:59 2015 UTC,I honestly think it's just a DLC at this point. We've seen increasing amounts of proof that rockstar is working on a jetpack currently. This in itself should be proof enough that one doesn't already exist.  If you've seen the jetpack mod video you quickly see how/why something like this could easily take months of development. Which in turn would also show itself in the form of massive amounts of code related to it's development.

There was another gtav fan in the room when this happened... I'll ask him tomorrow if he remembers any details (which character, fire damage, anything).  We were both excited when we figured out what was happening but it wore thin.  It seemed like a glitch."

chiliadmystery,39oagt,tryfuhl,2,Sat Jun 13 20:17:09 2015 UTC,It was Franklin.  It was discovered after a mission before reaching 100%... then headed to the base after discovered.  It was fire that did the damage.  The invincibility was lost after starting another mission.  Definitely not triggered by a jump but I find it funny that the first thought after discovering was to head to the military base.
chiliadmystery,39oagt,deltaninethc420,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:40:17 2015 UTC,"OK. I hadn't just finished a mission, and I did have 100%, but otherwise it sounds very similar.

chiliadmystery,39k091,Northern_Chiliad,8,Fri Jun 12 10:18:35 2015 UTC,I think it's safe to assume that the scientists appear at the radio telescopes because they are scientists and the radio telescopes are used for science.

It's not the prize that matters, it's the hunt."
chiliadmystery,39kgvs,Lord_Wadsworth,6,Fri Jun 12 13:46:40 2015 UTC,Rockstar should have released the jetpack before the PC version as it would obviously be modded in and spoil the tension build-up during all this hunt. Now anyone who plays this mod won't be very thrilled when the real thing comes out.
chiliadmystery,39kgvs,Bergara,7,Fri Jun 12 16:01:27 2015 UTC,I'd like to point out that we have no evidence that Rockstar has a Jetpack coded into the game.

Sure, you have to waddle through the muck to find the solid stuff in research, but often times I see people swear by some theory that is steeped in wishful thinking with a dash of ignorance.

chiliadmystery,39l1td,TheTrexiscoming,5,Fri Jun 12 13:57:17 2015 UTC,"After a few months of looking at this thing, i changed my thinking to class this UFO as an indicator on our progress. So once we get enough things correct, it wont vanish when we approach. Maybe allowing us to take it.  The way to think about it is this; Why wouldn't it be solid all the time. Its identical to the other FIB craft. Its not really worth putting such an elaborate set of glyphs on a mountain and making a mural just to see a duplicate of something that most people would of found by chance... its complete overkill, unless its shown for a different reason, giving it a use. What could its use be?"
chiliadmystery,39l1td,gbajere,2,Fri Jun 12 14:32:28 2015 UTC,"It always seemed strange to me how the Chiliad UFO disappears.

Yes, you can approach and interact with it, but if you look at it, its' rotating lights constantly get out of synch.    I don't know, might be just part of the bug on the new gen copies of the game that make the FIB symbol rotate backwards, but looking at it makes you think as if it's just there to cover something else that's actually there.    The idea of the Chilliad hologram actually being a mirage is interesting, it would mean that the reason we're seeing it is affected by the atmosphere and weather like you mentioned, which it is, but for it to be this accurate a depiction of a UFO, it would have to have a source, right?    What if the Sandy Shores UFO hologram is the source being reflected as a mirage to Chiliad?    Very very far fetched, I know, and has no practical implications on the hunt, but it's interesting to think about anyway."
chiliadmystery,39l1td,Paximillian,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:58:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, it would need a source, but I guess that could play into the government technology and being able to project a mirage or image, much as the books allude to.

There has been no find as of yet that indicates any hidden mission where that amount is needed.

chiliadmystery,39i3gs,MrMrMilhouse,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:07:59 2015 UTC,Totally agree. I love this. Even if it has nothing to do with 'The mystery'  I think this could've been purposeful. Makes total sense imo. I'm playing through again to 100% and am paying much  more attention to detail and the references to KARMA are crazy! R* put some time into it. For example: I saved a game when calling the therapist with Michael was optional. I had sex with a prostitute called the therapist Michael mentioned 'I had relations with a working class girl'  when asked about his sex life. It caught my attention he specified the woman. So I reloaded and didn't have Intercourse and called the therapist... THIS TIME he replies 'he's doing great and hasn't had any problems' when asked about his sex life. It was maybe 1 sentence different but to record extra dialogue for such a minute detail that'd only be noticed if you played twice..its just fascinating! I <3 R*

chiliadmystery,39i3gs,UnholyGhxst,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:04:28 2015 UTC,"A couple more connections I thought of. ""Upwards flows the truth form"" Kundalini energy in the form of a serpent travels up the spine opening the chakras. Michael goes to a 'head' shrink.  Franklin wants more for his life but he is empty and unfulfilled by his material wealth. The love of his life is gone.   The idea behind yoga is to bring the chakras into alignment so killing Trevor may not be the 'way'.  The heart chakra tries to connect with the third eye for knowledge and insight. Frank goes to Mike for mentoring.   Trevor tries to pull Mike back into a life of pleasure and hedonism. Perhaps there is a way to balance the karma of each character that is specific to that character. That I think is an old idea though.  Red is the root chakra. It's concerned with survival. All those red mofos trying to kill you. You have to kill the fear of death? Killing the reds is quite alright?  Has anyone noticed any snake imagery?"

Learned something new, ive always wondered what the term for that was (lampooning something by specifically taking one aspect of it COMPLETELY literally). Concretisation of metaphor is way easier to say.  The altruists have always been my favorite part of this game, and not being able to fully understand their motives felt like shoddy, confusing writing on the part of the GTA writers. Like they gave up on satire for the sake of naked crazy guy jokes. This makes me feel a lot better about that.   I'm not sure theres anything left to find with the altruists, as even the last real hope we had (the open box model in the files) burnt out like everything else. But starting to understand them from the writers perspective squeezes a little bit more fun out of it for me. nice work"
chiliadmystery,39cex9,MobiuusOne,2,Wed Jun 10 22:24:35 2015 UTC,"Well thanks again man! It would be totally weird if the connections between Rand and the Altruists was just a casual coincidence.

However I do not see any sort of correlation between Ayn Rand and the altruists, I've actually read her books and there are no similarities, OP is indeed talking out of his ass. I firmly believe OP reached pretty far to draw this conclusion and did so in order to create an Ayn Rand circlejerk. Her views really aren't radical, in fact that represent the last century pretty well 1900 - 2000 and she strongly defends free trade (capitalism)."
chiliadmystery,39cex9,Hoonin,2,Fri Jun 12 08:47:27 2015 UTC,"OP was referring to an interview with Ms.Rand where she equates the ethics of altruism to cannibalism, and then follows with a post using that interview as the basis for his theory- not any of her books.

chiliadmystery,39cex9,Hoonin,2,Fri Jun 12 20:48:25 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, sorry I didn't reply earlier- I've only really just all of this and I am pretty surprised tbh. I really didn't mean to offend with my idea, I was in no way trying to posit my connection as an absolute. This is the reason why I flaired it as 'speculation' rather than 'discovery' or even 'analysis'.  I totally acknowledge that an attempt to summarise an author's philosophical oeuvre in a single paragraph is reductive and doesn't take into account the numerous nuances involved in their ideals. I only provided the paragraph as a context to my main idea which as rsears14 rightly points out is to do with something Ayn Rand said in an interview, which in turn is uncannily coincidental with the gameplay of GTAV.   Not once did I assert that my idea was a definitive, incontrovertible analysis of the function of the Altruist Camp- it was merely an idea to be debated. I appreciate your rather trenchant criticisms, but I think I may have offended both of you, which was never my intention. Admittedly, I am no expert on Rand and it was gratuitous of me to say that I disagreed with her philosophy in my original post. Nonetheless, it is a bit hyperbolic to say that 'I am completely full of shit'.  Most importantly, I did not intend to compare Ayn Rand to Altruism- I hope my post implied the very opposite.  HOWEVER, reviewing my post, I can understand that some confusion might come out of my sentence, 'I have noticed discernible parallels between Ayn Rand's socio-economic ideals and the Altruist Camp'. I did not mean to assert that they were similar things- I can see why this sentence seems to imply it though and I apologise that it is misleading. Alternatively, I should have said that the altruist camp embodies Rand's metaphor that altruists are cannibals (which was the crux of the post).  In the interview that I cite, she incisively refutes altruism and this dismissal of altruism is what is embodied in the game. Integrally, it is the concretisation of Rand's metaphor that altruists are cannibals.  Forgive me if I'm wrong, but I make it pretty clear that Ayn Rand is for economic individualism and late capitalism and the Altruists prescribe the opposite political and social perspective. You're absolutely right Honnin, there is no correlation between Rand and the Altruists, they are completely antipodal to each other. This is why I reference an interview that indubitably demonstrates this.  From my understanding, these are the rough associations I make with each-  Ayn Rand: Capitalism, anti-religion, industrialism, economic individualism.  Altruists: Anti-capitalism, anti-industrialism, religion; cult.  Please correct me if I'm inaccurate, I am in no sense a Rand expert. Again, I'm sorry if the post wasn't very clear- it was quite a complex idea that I was trying to express and my post came out quite convoluted. It might not be an infallible analysis, I just thought I'd put it out there.   Thanks!"

We're up to our necks in posts simply about looking for something in the game (and not finding anything). It's refreshing to see people thinking about the story in more critical ways like this.  Seeing as GTAV is a satire/critique of U.S. culture, I wonder if a version of the Tea Party fits into game mythology somewhere too.  In an earlier comment here you mentioned ""postmodern cultural theory"" in relation to interviews with the game's writers. Can you think of any specific interviews off hand?

chiliadmystery,39cex9,marr,-2,Thu Jun 11 10:15:33 2015 UTC,"OP everything you said here is bullshit, and here is why.   The Altruists are anti-industrial revolution, on their in game website they have morse code that translates to, ""THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION HAS BEEN A DISASTER TO THE STABILITY OF THE HUMAN RACE."". They are also a religion, Ayn Rand was against religion and believed they slowed the progress of science and technology.   Source: http://gta.wikia.com/Altruist_Cult  Ayn Rand was a firm supporter of the industrial revolution as well as all of the sciences. For instance her most famous and read book, ""Atlas Shrugged"", is about the industrial revolution, science, technology, and capitalism and how liberal ideologies negatively effect them. There is also a book titled, ""The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution"", which is a compilation of her writings in which she firmly bashes liberal ideologies as well as religion for slowing technological advances, completely opposite of the Altruist beliefs.   Link to cliff notes on Atlas Shrugged http://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/a/atlas-shrugged/book-summary  Short summary for The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution.  This book is Ayn Rand's call to American youth to reject the tribal, conventional irrationality of the New Left and to grasp the need of a philosophical revolution founded on the supremacy of reason, with individualism, self-interest, science, technology, and progress as its consequences. There is nothing new about the New Left; it is the last gasp of an outworn philosophy. This is the view presented by Ayn Rand in a critical analysis of such superior perceptiveness and originality that it ranks as a landmark in the history of contemporary ideas. The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution is a brilliant addition to the works of one of America's most influential thinkers  Source: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/620688.The_New_Left  O and the best part!   ""A bit of context- Rand’s divisive and quasi-Machiavellian concept of ‘Objectivism’, posits that man’s highest telos is to pursue his own individual happiness, disregarding the wellbeing of others and refuting the altruistic ethical system and its ubiquitous moral influence."".   The word Altruism in which ""altruists"" is derived from, is defined as the principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others. Which completely destroys your insane comparison between Ayn Rand and the Altruists.   In all honesty its 5:10 P.M. where I currently am and I have to leave for work shortly. I could keep posting demonstrations and comparisons as to just how wrong you are OP but I have way more important things to be doing.   You couldn't be farther from the truth and since you have a firm grasp on English, (I am impressed with your vocabulary) everyone here basically took everything you said as truth."

chiliadmystery,39buf6,Lunaphase,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:51:49 2015 UTC,"Here's a common example where you'll see a derail installed.  You have a main line and a smaller track that goes to some industrial plant where a handful of cars will sit and be loaded/unloaded by said plant.  You REALLY don't want those cars rolling back onto the main line where they could hit/be hit by another train (which could be really deadly if a passenger train hits them at speed).  So you put a derail on the industrial track before it meets up with the main line to knock the cars off the rails (which btw at lower speeds isn't too nasty, the car may even stay upright and all it takes is a crane or two to fix things)."

Drunk couple is more than 1 person, and they wont kill ursula, as even if you take her, you can still call her to make rain after. So they must let her go.

chiliadmystery,39fenx,Midgetpanda44,7,Thu Jun 11 10:31:45 2015 UTC,what about the alien stuck in the ice seen in game (in the beginning) ?
chiliadmystery,39fenx,SnakyAdib,5,Thu Jun 11 12:08:31 2015 UTC,"The OP was actually what I thought for a while there, but as the rabbit hole gets deeper it seems like there HAS to be something to it (even if it is as-yet incomplete).  But the alien in the ice took it all the way to the Twilight Zone.  (edit) If the FIB was in on the bank plan then it stands to reason they happened upon the alien during their time in Yankton. You have a chance to find it on accident in the middle of car chase so it's not a stretch to assume the Feds came across it during the set-up/aftermath of the prologue. And then the 10 year time gap gives plenty of time for it to develop into the 5th season of the X-Files."
chiliadmystery,39fenx,CapnNoodle,0,Thu Jun 11 16:56:05 2015 UTC,Not much evidence to say it's a real alien. Based on evidence that could be a guy in an alien costume who drowned and then froze. Since the actors that wear alien costumes at Richards Majestic look like that. But I could be wrong.

But I'm lvl 88 and it should not be a problem for me to do 100% of online of the R* created content. I have done all the races, but I have not won all of them.  It might be why I don't play a lot of online is because I've won 50 races and lost 157.. so... Bad looser much? xD  I'm not sure what a checklist for online would look like?  I'd assume lvl 100,   All R* created content attended or won?  heist completed?  Max the character stats...  More?"
chiliadmystery,39fenx,0verfl0w,2,Fri Jun 12 06:11:19 2015 UTC,there are a lots of random things to won the races. I also stopped at 50 wins with some friends and redditors help. It is still fun with friends (wet road+traffic+sports classic cars and voice)  about the checklist. I think all achievements is our goal. If you need help we can do it together.  And assuming mystery was before heists you don't need them complited.
chiliadmystery,39fenx,OleMno,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:26:47 2015 UTC,"Ok. yes. this seem interesting, and I've been very interested in the 6 minutes rule before. A while back I lost my motivation, because it seemed like the 6 minute rule was debunked as there are many many places you can stand, switch and the character does not move for 6 minutes.   As of 100% if all achievements in online is needed, I think it's faster to get in touch with someone that has all achievements in online and make them do it in SP.  I only have the 100% soft in sp. I don't have all the achievements. And because it's summer (I live in Norway, long cold winters) I don't play as much. That's why I was quick with the PS4 and Pc SP 100%.   I'm sorry to say that it might be faster to get someone else to do it. There is nothing I'd want more then help get the mystery solved. If this must be done quick, find another one, but I'll work on this when I have the time. I'll make it my new goal."

chiliadmystery,398w58,Whadsed,5,Wed Jun 10 02:34:50 2015 UTC,"I kind of gave up on the mystery a long time ago and basicly all I do now is fuck with the gangs.  I kind of like to start a fight between ballas or GS gangsters and the police. One time in grove street I got 2 stars and went hiding behind that little wall the non-violent NPC's jump over when the police arrives.  Ballas shot the helicopter, killing the co-pilot. The ballas killed most of the ground cops and my wanted level disappeared. The helicopter stayed around and landed. The pilot came out and had some words in the sense of : 'you killed my partner now it's your turn'. I couldn't enter the helicopter after the pilot had gotten out.  he got shot by ballas.  I believe there is something up with this whole ballas vs davis gang shit. what I have no clue of.  Fun tip : steal a firetruck and use it as a tank, you cant get shot from behind. You can run over cops, but not kill them. (killing them means 3 stars and the gang-NPC's all stop shooting the cops, no more fun)  You can however use the firetruck to bump into cop cars and knoking them over, the NPC's will kill em off then. If you do however get 3 stars, use the tunnel for the metro to hide, wanted level dissapears quickly,"

chiliadmystery,398w58,Mercc96,0,Wed Jun 10 04:02:09 2015 UTC,I believe I was also with Franklin as I generally mess about with the gangs around that way when I play as him.  I do also remember being in a helicopter (can't remember who as) and from a distance seeing one of the usual police helicopters with the search lights travelling with one or two of these unarmed buzzards flying above the FIB buildings n such towards the South side again. Can't remember why I wasn't able to keep following them though sorry.   Glad I'm not the only one to have seen them though as I'd never seen anything other than the usual police choppers and the odd military jet/cargobob around the military areas.

chiliadmystery,39aqu2,Lord_Wadsworth,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:10:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response :) Btw i don't have GTA 5 so i have not discovered these things by myself :)
chiliadmystery,39aqu2,Stealth_Pyro,2,Fri Jun 12 11:06:16 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure most would agree it's Mt. Chiliad. For one, the mural is on the mountain. The eye is present at the top under the observation platform, and the mountain glyphs seem to somewhat line up with the Xs."
chiliadmystery,398uv5,kgn95,2,Wed Jun 10 02:24:54 2015 UTC,Where is it?
chiliadmystery,398uv5,SnakyAdib,3,Wed Jun 10 08:40:18 2015 UTC,These have been known about and reported before.  They are glitches in the game textures and I believe they often appear where there is a very slight gap between textures.  I've seen them in multiple places across the map.
chiliadmystery,398uv5,AnEvilVet,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:46:10 2015 UTC,"As a gamer and a mod user, I've seen a lot of texture glitches... never seen one look like this. I ain't saying you're wrong, but those really look like colored LED's. Do they bend all weird when you change your angle? Or do they always look exactly that way?"
chiliadmystery,398uv5,MobiuusOne,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"In the ones I've seen, the colours shift when you move."
chiliadmystery,398uv5,AnEvilVet,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:10:05 2015 UTC,"But do they blur and change, or do they keep that specific dot pattern? I feel like a graphical glitch shouldn't be so perfectly outlined and defined. Does it behave like lights under a door, or does it behave like a glitch?"
chiliadmystery,398uv5,MobiuusOne,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:36:14 2015 UTC,"They change like a strip of led lights where the lights change colour by flowing along.  The glitch also appears in numerous places. I've seen it on doors, garages, building walls and even on mountain sides. It isn't indicating a special location."
chiliadmystery,398uv5,AnEvilVet,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:56:44 2015 UTC,"theres a door in fort zancudo that does this, have seen it in my own game. but an important distinction is that its not just the door in zancudo, theres a whole section of wall that lights up like rainbow style, right where the wall meets the ground. given its in an obscure area (i think by the big water towers) and the fact that nothings come of it, its a glitch"

I just got this niggling feeling that R* dont want the torrenters (free Riders) to get hold of the jetpac , just the paying customers who deserve it.Like Huge_Dabs says YOUR story .Maybe we have to level up all the vehicles online and do all missions and R* created races , WHO KNOWS , plus 100% campain .Has anyone done that yet ?

chiliadmystery,399ggz,gbajere,4,Wed Jun 10 16:29:58 2015 UTC,"This sounds good, we already know that time travel is mentioned in the game, and online is supposed to take place before the events of single player.

I believe also that it is both story and online that makes the jetpac possible . I have said it before but for your reference i think that you have to complete the story then unlock something online .This guarantees that people who torrent the game cant get the jetpac cos torrented gta 5 cant be played online.Also this ties in with the trigger for the jetpac being a dlc that can only be triggered online thus giving that individual person the jetpac and no-one else .Of course that person would share the knowlege of how they got it but at the moment it seems like a good theory to me as i have been swallowed up and spat out by the whole mystery and my head is spinning lol !!!!"
chiliadmystery,399ggz,gbajere,2,Wed Jun 10 09:17:30 2015 UTC,"I'm leaning towards having to do something first online, then go to SP and carry on. Online happens before SP, so would be a good little trick to make this more complicated! I have a feeling that we will do the online 'thing' then durning the game we will see our online protagonist, maybe in the background as a random NPC or something, and that's the que that we are on the right track to compete our story... It's how we play the game that counts..."
chiliadmystery,39771j,Herbalist40,3,Tue Jun 9 19:20:35 2015 UTC,"You've made lots of connections (whether real or imagined), but I wouldn't think they would hinge the whole mystery around a TV show and you couldn't solve it if you hadn't seen it. I definitely believe that there are easter-eggs/shout-outs to ""Lost"" (I was a huge fan when it aired), but that's how Rockstar does things... every GTA has references to movies or TV shows, but nothing hinges on you knowing it. Maybe they changed it up this time around, but as consistent as they are, it's hard to swallow and would be a disappointing end to the mystery, especially for hunters who haven't seen ""Lost"" or just plain don't like it. Sorry for being a Debbie-Downer, it's just my opinion... the video is well made and I appreciate the time spent on it :)"

Your opinion is valid and i appreciate constructive criticism ;)  As a huge GTA fan since i got special edition London on PC as a kid i couldn't disagree with them sticking to a certain format but ... This is RockstarNorth we are dealing with aka the ugly duckling of the company and they have been known to do things there way even when R* HQ disagrees... And this would fit their style. Plus i can't remember if i said this in the documentary but lost would have been airing as they developped this game unlike alot of other references we have (rocketeer, kubrick, back to the future ...) i can just picture the developers going home after a long days editing and watching Lost lol maybe i'm crazy but the truth is as humans we are influenced mainly by the present and what is fresh in our minds !

chiliadmystery,39771j,hatton101,2,Wed Jun 10 16:06:57 2015 UTC,"Sure Dude 108 is a huge part of what dharma is based on. one of the dharma logos bares the staff like in the prop 208 logo, so it is kind of a hunch but it's something to look into the reason i can't ignore it is in the missions i showed, it's often in the cutscenes or on the yellow path they set along side Ron signs and Cluckin Bell signs. Its a but confusing at first but there are so many things that connect (to me of course) that i can't take it as coincidence. Now as for the length of the video i cut alot out, including the prop 208 website and the two pages it advertises and all the hidden word play in those webpages plus a bunch of other stuff.  But my usual viewers enjoy the in depth looks i do and i felt all the elements i put in helped make my case.

After posting this I went back and read your post dabs, you got a good line of logic. The only counter I have to the WC point is that WC usually denotes a Water Closet (bathroom). Otherwise, keep up the good work!  Segregate and Rearrange. That's gotta be the key. It's the only thing close to a key we have thus far. Under that logic, let's take a crack at this:  JD O  19390  J6 JEFF  FIGO  %0Y  Now, the first thing I'll do is rearrange things a bit. Some segregation if you will:  JD O J JEFF FIGO Y  19390 6 0  %  One of the conditions that we know to ""start"" our quest is completion. 100%. So let's pull 100% out of the above.  JD O J JEFF FIGO Y  939 6   100%  At this point, I converted the remaining numbers into letters based on their number in the alphabet. This provides me with 2 more vowels and 2 more consonants.  JD O J JEFF FIGO Y  ICIF  100%  Dabbling in programming, the first thing that pops out to me is ""IF 100%"" A condition. If ??? = 100%. The next big word that pops out is YOGI backwards. we also have the glaring ""JEFF"" portion of the letters. And that's where my brain stops working for the night.   I also wonder if there's anything in the Oevare painting that might be able to add to this code or be used to crack it. Still waiting to see if anyone posts that texture anywhere...  Probably been done exactly this way by the rest of you guys, but I figured on the off-chance it hadn't been segregated and rearranged in this line of logic, this might help the decoding move forward.

Not trying to shade you our your ideas Huge_dabs, I like the connections you are making. Just the kinda stoner ideas that got me into this mystery in the first place. R* did once say that the games big secret was developed throughout the dev of the whole game, if I'm not mistaken. That leaves a lot of stones to turn over. Keep developing this theory and see if you can find any other odd connections. This whole thing is so convoluted."

chiliadmystery,39275f,Dinger2013,3,Tue Jun 9 15:38:32 2015 UTC,Yeah. I get ya. They are some weird coincidences. All I can say is in the beginning when everything was new and exciting this sub was really cool to frequent. Now its died down and I feel like everyone's spirits have gotten pretty low on the whole mystery being solved without DLC thing. So if you don't have anything really big to contribute or you bring up something covered already you'll be chewed out or ignored.
chiliadmystery,390exe,generalzee,13,Mon Jun 8 09:48:19 2015 UTC,"As an avid mystery hunter for a long time, I am not happy with my theory on this. I think my theory is right, but it's disappointing.  The most likely reason they can spawn this UFO more easily than the Zancudo UFO is that this UFO was intended to be flyable, probably in an early-planned DLC that never came out (Though it still may). The early consoles came shipped with a file that had an Alien HUD, and would seem a reasonable thing to appear when you climbed into the UFO. Unfortunately, on the PC version, this file is no longer there indicating that they are either not planning on having that DLC anymore, or decided that in the PC version the Alien HUD would be IN the DLC (I don't know why the change of heart now, though).  There are some major problems with the FIB UFO. The collisions don't work very well (There are videos of it driving like a car on the ground with other cars just moving right through it), there isn't an enter/exit animation (though some modders use the Hydra or Lazer entry animation to make it look better), and from the videos I've seen it doesn't act like an aircraft when it comes to weaponry, it acts like a car, indicating that R* hasn't put in any of the functionality we would need to fly the UFO.  So, TL;DR you're excitement that it could be a usable vehicle isn't entirely misplaced, but it's unlikely that you can fly it in the vanilla game."
chiliadmystery,390exe,gbajere,6,Mon Jun 8 11:35:22 2015 UTC,"Seems plausible, although I don't think the Alien HUD is connected to the FIB craft though, as it would be in English. None of the ""UFO's"" are actually Unidentifiable Flying Objects... They are all man made, meaning they are just aircraft. We all call them UFO's for obvious reasons, but the only one that could be an actual UFO is the sunken one (if noone else has found it, but i think the FIB either found it and copied it. Or created it, and crashed it during testing, etc).  Most don't see the importance of this, but its pretty crucial, imo. It probably means that the mural is actually showing us a government cover up(s). The UFO, Egg and Jetpack could all be part of a back story that we have yet to find out. We work closely with the FIB in this GTA which is a first, so i wouldn't be too surprised if the mural is centred around the FIB, IAA and us..."
chiliadmystery,390exe,Huge_Dabs,2,Mon Jun 8 13:07:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly! It's just like the Roswell crash, they copied the crashed ""UFO"" to create their own. I'm not saying Roswell is real, just that the basis of the story is the same."
chiliadmystery,390exe,gbajere,2,Mon Jun 8 15:12:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, basically.  Im leaning towards the FIB crashed it during a test flight else they would of brought it up from the sea bed. They just left it down there as the actual flying craft is now up and running (maybe public knowledge, as we do hear drone talk on the radio), so no need to hide it? Or they could of ripped out all the parts and left the shell? Some sub members think Frank Mathers found it, and he was killed off. Which would place the sunken ufo in the FIB secret works category i guess lol  We must be missing part of the back story somewhere, or we are meant to piece it together for ourselves?"
chiliadmystery,390exe,Huge_Dabs,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:39:48 2015 UTC,Another note: Is this what the spaceship parts came from? If so...why are they so scattered? That would mean the UFO flew all over the place as it was crashing
chiliadmystery,390exe,Y_Sam,3,Mon Jun 8 16:26:07 2015 UTC,"To be fair, not everything in the game has to make sense.    The submarine parts were also scattered all across the city which is waaaay more retarded when you think about it, a dude whose sub has been sabotaged somehow managed to circle around all of San Andreas while dropping various parts of it everywhere and still managed to drown...    The parts where probably there only to make looking for them harder and ""funnier""."
chiliadmystery,390exe,gbajere,2,Tue Jun 9 07:29:20 2015 UTC,Good point. Would make sense i think. I guess if it broke up really high above the map it could spread that far...
chiliadmystery,390exe,Huge_Dabs,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:42:41 2015 UTC,"The UFO seems to be completely intact though...maybe it was carrying something? Or better yet, what if it was bringing those parts to Earth, and began to crash, so they emptied their load high in the sky to lose some weight and try to gain control? Possibly because Earth's gravity was different than their own planet's so it made their ship unstable? (They run on anti-gravity) And this theory would signify the ""aliens"" bringing us their technology."
chiliadmystery,390exe,gbajere,2,Mon Jun 8 18:04:22 2015 UTC,"True. Depends how far you want to get into it. We don't get to see the bottom or one side, so could be damaged some how. But the parts we collect are all the same, so it's not very detailed to build a big story"
chiliadmystery,390exe,gbajere,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:30:26 2015 UTC,"So  What is the underwater  UFO(vehicle) ? in  programing terms? Is it an object , a vehicle or just part of the landscape underwater textures , cos i havnt seen it spawned either . Maybe if we can categorise things , we can have a better understanding of them. The hollogram (ufo) is what exactly?"
chiliadmystery,390exe,gbajere,2,Mon Jun 8 13:27:24 2015 UTC,"I would avoid doing this programmatically, as its not really important. You could, in theory, just be playing the game to trigger a download. So anything we think we have in programming terms could be useless. Also, R* would of made this with the mindset of people playing it, and solving it. The code would be put together in a way to make the hacking hard/impossible...  Anyway, with that said; The sunken one is part of the landmass, and the hologram is just the normal FIB craft with different effects, I believe. Someone else might know differently, as i try not to go too deep into the files..."
chiliadmystery,390exe,DarkLordCZ,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:41:04 2015 UTC,"Thats what i have said all along but with this thread i am trying to understand the game mechanics .I believe its a trigger .Easter Egg Triggers in this game are related to PLACES , TIME or WEATHER combinations or am i wrong .So if the underwater ufo is a place and not a vehicle (does this make sense what i am getting at?)Hackers cant spawn places , only spawn TO places and that would be randomly like playing spot the ball with a marble making it impossible (99.999%) to trigger something by using a trainer etc .

chiliadmystery,390exe,shadowfaythe,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:17:27 2015 UTC,"I think i get what you are saying...   The sunken is a place. The FIB craft is an object, as it has no way of moving. Oddly the same location has the screen effects online, but no craft. So it could be classed as a mix of location and an object. The MC hologram is also an object... Im still undecided if it is an actual hologram or just an indicator to show us we are on the correct path. Bit like other gaming puzzles where something will light up to show progress, eg; Tomb Raider. The abduction UFO, with Aliens (i personally think its just FIB men in costume, but thats a different issue) is part of the map i think. From videos i have seen, its part of the game world.   Someone will probably jump in soon and tell me i'm wrong, but that my current understanding lol. Im not big on files really"

chiliadmystery,390exe,NOTprofessorbooty,4,Fri Jun 12 19:45:53 2015 UTC,iirc the hippy camp ufo and zancudo ufo are both fixed models (actually part of the map) and cannot be moved just like the crashed ufo. The hackers are spawning in the only possible ufo model they can use.
chiliadmystery,392ku4,coolsquid1218,6,Mon Jun 8 20:12:41 2015 UTC,"It sounds like the bird Peyote that spawns around there, maybe that's it. The peyote gives off the sound of the animal you turn into and adds effects to it."

chiliadmystery,38zmst,Jetpack_Jones,5,Mon Jun 8 04:23:14 2015 UTC,"I had wondered about the order of missions. If there's a more logical progression to things. For example would it make sense to start the epsilon missions around the time that his family leaves as that's michaels lowest point (except mabey his death). Doing these missions at the end doesn't make sense as by that point he's kind of at peace with things. I'm sure there were a few other missions I had though of like this but I can't recall them now if I remember I'll edit them in.  Edit: Mikes Barry mission after did somebody say yoga, so he drinks the stuff of jimmys, goes mental and starts hallucinating aliens and the like...then he hits Barry's joint and it brings on flashbacks to that incident."
chiliadmystery,38zmst,Diabolic73,3,Mon Jun 8 05:56:52 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling the Barry mission is a reminder of something else, the prologue... the number of aliens we can kill is similar to that of police killed by Trevor in the prologue and is the first S&F mission available to Mike. IMO he feels guilty for what went down that day.   But you're right about starting the epsilon mission at the correct time, it is available after the Father/Son mission. In my game I start the epsilon mission after Frank does the Children of the Mountain test, the link to the website shows on the Bleeter page as soon as Frank has done one of the first Tonya missions, the one when Lamar gives you Chop straight after. There's also a point in the game when CoM will send Frank the email without Frank interacting with it but that's later in the game which could also seem significant. I think there are two different times these cults should be joined, but now I'm getting off track. (still working on it)"
chiliadmystery,38zmst,Diabolic73,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:44:15 2015 UTC,"Ahh yeah I suppose it makes sense when you look at it that way.  I think that's the only thing that makes this theory a bit dubious is the fact there's so many variables of when things can be done. The merryweather heist is a good example, if I'm correct (haven't played for a while) you can potentially leave this till after the Paleto score. So in a way it's a question of which do you do first. Although having said that its the sort of line of enquiry I plan to look into when I'm finally reunited with the game."
chiliadmystery,38zmst,rsears14,4,Mon Jun 8 09:22:54 2015 UTC,"Killing Mike makes sense, always has to me, though ive kept him around in my saves just in case. All the extracurricular stuff with Mike can be done before the end of the game and 100% completion. whereas Trevor gets a mission that spawns right after the story mode, and franklin gets a mission that spawns right after 100% completion. to my knowledge, mike doesnt have anything like this. a clue to him being the one we need to kill?  especially when it comes to epsilon, its always been strange to me that you can basically complete the entire strand of missions from practically the start of the game. i wonder if before you beat the game, you do the epsilon missions. then kill michael and see if it triggers any epsilon missions or dialogue (possibly thanking if michael stole the money, or coming after you for killing one of their own if you delivered the money and kept the tractor.)  has anyone ever tried this?"
chiliadmystery,38zmst,Diabolic73,5,Mon Jun 8 05:59:43 2015 UTC,"Also that Trevor doesn't get involved in the killing of Michael. Whereas Michael not only steps in and tries to convince Frank that Trev needs to die, will actually do it if you ultimately choose not to. And as Trevor States in his death scenes he always been honest to Franklin whereas Michael constantly keeps Franklin in the dark.  Also some wild speculation for the people who search for meaning in the dialogue. If you choose to kill Trevor, Franklin says ""I'm not interested in the truth"" this could be a double meaning as in the truth behind the game, doubtful though."
chiliadmystery,38zmst,Dadalot,3,Mon Jun 8 06:22:15 2015 UTC,"Franklin says ""I'm not interested in the truth""   This is very interesting, I've never heard it myself. Lot's of little things we ignore in the dialogue that can change our decisions so drastically. Nice!"
chiliadmystery,38zmst,diegooo1972,2,Mon Jun 8 08:58:39 2015 UTC,"Another ""truth"" reference, when Franklin calls Beverly after Paparazzo-The Meltdown, Beverly says to meet at the  hotel where we have the option to kill him, but not yet.  Beverly says ""The truth comes first!""    Hint to do Epsilon before that point?"
chiliadmystery,38zmst,diegooo1972,2,Mon Jun 8 14:02:19 2015 UTC,"Originally I was of the opinion that Trevor should die for no reason other than he seemed like the bad guy. Now having played the game through a few times it's obvious Mike's a traitor that needs to be dealt with, sure Trevor is a psychopath but does that necessarily make him worse than Mike? No way. But yeah it's true that both Frank & Trev have missions after 100%, I have a feeling that both of these missions are apparitions."
chiliadmystery,38zmst,dwlater,3,Mon Jun 8 08:54:04 2015 UTC,I tought about that many times. Expecially in killing one of the other characters. If that's a right path I always tought the plot is quite bad in that point of view. Franklin never have a deep remorse vs Mike. Nothing more then some disappointment about mike betrayal Trevor. And apart that Trevor is crazy there's no personal involvement that justify killing him. Both mission where you chose to kill someone are quite forced in the plot.  I can say that Mike was too selfish. And when the Chinese come at Brad tombs he shot at Trevor when he run on the gate. But missing him from a short distance. Nothing can help you make a valid choice killing Mike.  It may be a path but imho is too forced in the plot.  The strange thing about Mike Epsilon program is that you can collect tract if you steal money and if you get the tractor. In my last game i got the tractor. But it's not clear at all to collect tract even if you steal money.
chiliadmystery,38zmst,diegooo1972,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:21:53 2015 UTC,"Mike tried to kill Trevor in that Brad Graveyard scene, Trevor throws his gun at Mike and Mike returns fire as Trevor runs. IMO Mike was trying to kill him."

Doesn't seems so focus to kill. But this is really open to interpretation. I agree with you that this particular event is really suspicious."
chiliadmystery,38zmst,gtamike,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:29:25 2015 UTC,"Not everything is a hint for the mystery. It could have just been to make a more dramatic scene.  How often in movies and TV shows do we see characters do things that make no sense, just to make things more interesting?"
chiliadmystery,38zmst,diegooo1972,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:07:59 2015 UTC,Really true. But we are trying to find reason for things hoping there's a reason. I'm not sure about that. But if we try solve a supposed mistery we need to try to understand things. That's the game in the game after all. Wherever it takes.
chiliadmystery,38zmst,GtaHov,2,Tue Jun 9 08:11:09 2015 UTC,"game of life indeed brother, but killing mike is wrong.   killing trevor is wrong also. they are choices for Franklin that he dosnt want. yes he thinks about it and says things that may give the impression that he will kill M or T, but the truth of Franklin is C.  why.. cause killing mike dosnt make things better. (this makes Amanda a widow and Tracy and Jimmy fatherless)  only mike can save himself, just as his wife has askd of him."

Mike sais many times that the big house drinking around the pool was his best dream and that he achieve that. But also many more times he point that he decided that way for his family. He also realize that his group is going out of head. Trevor sais that as well to Mike if you get out with him to drink something after you have completed the main story.  I'm doing a ""good will"" karma play and i'm really focus on reason to do what on every character. Mike also propose to give all his money to Trevor cause he don't  care. Trevor refuse cause it's not important to him as well. And forgive Mike.

Not good at giving time to others. Lazy and self absorbed, but needy. Lazy and solipsistic - then again, family is awful. Really not capable of giving to others. Ignores family life. Ignores people closest to him. Avoids family commitments. Will probably get left by family. Not a good care giver. Incapable of seeing needs of others. Complains nobody cares, then avoids family like plague!    if you do help your family in the side mission you may get one of these:  Family minded.  Decent member of family - unfortunately, family is awful! Loves family - having met them, not sure quite why. Loyal to crazy family, which I suppose is a start. Cares about family - so not totally solipsistic. Cares about family, despite their obvious problems. Co dependent. Family minded for some reason. Spends time with family - and manages not to kill them - maybe a possible sign of progress? Wants to be good family member. Very dependent on family for self-worth, which is odd. Family focused - not sure why."

Still it's crazy that, out of all the millions of players and thousands that's have posted here, many of which have been eager enough to try cargo bobbing the space docker on top of a UFO and honking for hours....how many simply turned off all the automatic help the game starts you with....And beat it?

I hope when you try it, you are consequent enough and never use the special abilities. i am no consolero, i cant speak for. but on PC without HUD and Autoaim even without the special abilities - i think its possible. i startet such an playtrough. but i stopped because of gaining an 100% Save first (start with PC release).  i will give you the advice, that without hud, missions often break for no reason. because you didnt take the intended route.  e.g. when you drive from michaels house to simeons carshop with franklin. if you take the wrong route the mission breaks.  but  whether it relates to the mystery or not, it is a great boost of immersion. and when you realize that you can hide from police behind trees, in containers and so on, new game elements are open to you.  i whish good luck"

chiliadmystery,391db2,KillaPam,0,Tue Jun 9 04:24:07 2015 UTC,Speak for yourselves please. I stood in line for 20 minutes at midnight release in 2013 JUST to get the Jetpack.   The first two things I wanted to do was fly a jet around the map and then find the Jetpack. You could imagine my disappointment after waiting years for a HD revival of San Andreas and the Jetpack itself and there not being one so far.   For Rockstar to put a blatant image of a Jetpack on the Mural and not include one in the game is very mean.
chiliadmystery,391db2,adamisking,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:49:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, it might have been mean if they did that, but they didn't as far as I can tell, because this is the image on the mural for sure: http://i.imgur.com/VVx90Y7.jpg  Now it makes me wonder what happens if you beat the altruists with bat instead of shoot them. I imagine it's pretty hard :o"

But i dont understand what the rest of you guys are posting about. What mystery? As far as i was concerned nothing is confusing or conspiracyish other than that little icon of a stick figure wearing what would seem to be a jetpack. and outside of that icon there is no other mention of a jetpack.... THAT needs answers. But thats it, i dont think its anything bigger than that. I really dont think there are any confusing things other than the mural itself but mostly just that little jetpack icon (maybe the egg, but i think that is just easter egg).  Honeslty tho, what else is mysterious abut this?"

I just reached 100% the other day but I've been busy with work so I've been unable to do a lot more testing. I did however get a response from Rockstar and they said the following.   Carol K. Wednesday at 14:50  Hello HeelJmacz,  After investigating we see that it is not a glitch. However, we would like to inform you that as you already completed the Altriusts, there is no need to take another hitchhiker to the camp.  If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to let us know.  Have a nice day!  Best regards,  Carol K.

chiliadmystery,38v01i,Jmacz,4,Sun Jun 7 03:10:07 2015 UTC,"This was my thoughts as well! They didn't say that there was no need to deliver the hiker, but just no need to take another one to the camp.   And I agree about the jetpack question. Though it would be nice to get some answers, I'm sure a ton of people already asked that question. If they got a positive response, we def would have seen it here."

chiliadmystery,38v01i,DRUMIINATOR,4,Sun Jun 7 02:49:07 2015 UTC,Is there any way to tell in the code exactly what clearing the camp does?
chiliadmystery,38v01i,Jmacz,6,Sun Jun 7 03:34:10 2015 UTC,"Well we know from a thread about a month back that there are 3 possible endings. My theory right now is that those three endings are.   Kill all the Altruists Don't kill all the Altruists. ?????   I also find it really strange that if you die, when you retry the mission there is a thunderstorm. Especially because right before it happens they literally scream, ""KILL HIM! KILL HIM SO HE CAN BE PURE!"""

The thunderstorm is programmed into the encounter right? Why and what for? That line of dialogue: Make him pure!   Trevor has a lot of weather coded missions, this one and the friends reunited mission. Idk I just think this is a line of mystery that should be followed."
chiliadmystery,38v01i,DRUMIINATOR,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:10:22 2015 UTC,What happens when you flee the shoutout? Can you come back with more victims?

chiliadmystery,38v01i,DRUMIINATOR,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:08:55 2015 UTC,"So then the third ending could be anything? You can completely skip that part of the game with no reason that we know of right?

I was flying helicopter with Michael looking for spaceship parts and flew over the altruist camp and suddenly the cut scene of trevor being kidnapped by the weirdos started.

From that iamnotastalker page:  ""Of the Sandy Shores design, Grand Theft Auto V art director Aaron Garbut said in a 2014 interview with the Edge, “We did know the [biographies] for the three characters right at the start, so we knew we wanted to create an area for Trevor out in the sticks.  Towards the beginning of preproduction, I met up with [Rockstar president] Sam [Houser] in LA, and we spent a week together driving about, just exploring and talking.  During that trip, we drove out into the desert and eventually ended up visiting Salton Sea [in California].  We went to an amazing spot called Bombay Beach and expected a real-life Trevor to burst out on us at any second.  When the full reference trip was organized, we sent a team out to Salton Sea for a few days.”  LOVE it!"""

chiliadmystery,38r4gw,nemprime,3,Sat Jun 6 03:40:28 2015 UTC,"Right. I posted earlier that the English channel is known as a ufo hotspot, just did a quick Google search of Escondido and one of the results is for ufo activity, definitely on To something with this. Any ufo stuff from Alberta?  EDIT back after another quick search, yup, ufo activity in Alberta, even a ufo research group based there and in the sixties there was the proposal of the world's first ufo landing pad to be built in, yes you guessed it, Alberta."

chiliadmystery,38plsg,platasnatch,5,Sat Jun 6 02:09:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's the thread that I've been looking into.  Nowhere can anyone provide proof that it's fake. As well, no one has really 'taken credit' for it if it was a fake (mainly there's no one strictly trying to make an issue out of it one way or the other). Also, there were multiple videos (at least 2 by two distinct individuals) and the way the transmission was broadcast and the way it sounded was as far as I can tell, the same.   Moreover, I think that the fact that a different transmission was 'discovered' when someone took Trevor to the spot instead of Michael only helps to prove that it's not a fake because trying to fake a second transmission takes a decent amount of time and effort (which again, no one has taken credit for).   Wholly, it seems to me when reading through that thread, that people just 'declared' it fake for no reason and on no real identifiable basis other that the fact that they say ""oh well, I went there and heard nothing, even though I don't have 100%, but still i say it's fake""; and to me that's just a bullshit excuse so I decided to delve into this a bit and produce a map so at least if it is real someone can have an easier time trying to find it xD  Edit: As for the numbers, if they are real, I haven't got the slightest idea what they are for, but I imagine that they would be in some way a VERY big clue. Which is also why I feel bringing this up is important, cause if we've been just looking past a big clue this entire time... that would suck--so we really need to check this out more and find out if it's real."

I'm on PC with a downloaded 100% file. Legit regardless. I used a trainer to change the time and weather, and to spawn there to view the UFO. I saw it, jumped on a Sanchez at the top of Chiliad. I drove down the west side and hit the broken wooden ramp to nowhere (come to thing of it, what the hell could have been the point of a pathway off the mountain) and parachuted to the coast kind of near the peninsula a little south of Paletto Bay. I got into the water and spawned one of the speed boats, and enabled speed boast. I then travel out to about where your waypoints are in your picture, then proceeded to head north. I turned around after I went a decent bit above the furthest northern part of the map, still way off the west coast though. I then started super speeding slightly above the water, in as good of a north and south grid as I could maintain. There were 2 moments where I thought the radio went out (I was listening to music) but I am pretty sure I can attribute that to the song, as it happened during the same song the two times. I am unfamiliar with the song so I don't want to rule the possibility of interference out. I made it about half way to shore before calling it a quits due to the likely hood of finding it and my shitty methods.   If this starts getting more attention, or better yet, more specifics I would be glad to help. Hell, I'm really tired to so I will give it a little time tomorrow as well.  Happy hunting."

Next, I helped with finding it's location. Bring up the map in game, set your cursor just to the west of Zancudo where the vertical yellow line intersects the land mass. Then go straight north till you get the location. Cross check it with the islands east(horizontal yellow line). Which should give you a pretty close location to the actual location.

It was a very clever troll, especially since he posted this just hours after the Chiliad UFO was discovered for the first time.  If you watch his video, you can clearly hear that the strange beeps are coming from a different source than his TV.

I agree, the bottom lines could indicate under the sea/lower than sea level, so your idea should be looked into imo, never know what you might find!  EDIT: We are always left with 2 protags, and we know 1 will stand with the UFO for a period of time... so send the other down in the sub to investigate. Perhaps calling eachother as we do it? Maybe we get some comm's between them?  EDIT 2:  if you, or anyone else, is in the game at the moment, can you go to the area OP as painted for us to be at 3am and look back at MC? Im wondering if we have a ridge, and MC actually starts below sea level... this could support the idea that the lines at the base of the mural are sea level, and that will support OP's idea of using the sub"
chiliadmystery,38nk1b,Synyster182,2,Fri Jun 5 11:27:23 2015 UTC,The observatory doesnt change pending on the moon though..it tells us the same thing everyday based on the sun (which doesnt move like he moon because its at the center of our solar system) the moon changes paths throughout the 28days alont with the phases of moon. The dials at observatory tell us the same thing daily which points to more of a puzzle than to telling us a position of moon and sun daily

The pictures are their locations, the cracked egg is symbolic of hey this is an easter egg notice how my lines tie everything together. Or maybe it's an elaborate puzzle that once cracked we summon a ufo on top of chiliad that blows a hole in the side of the mountain with lightning. where we decend through the tunnels and find the jet pack that CJ hid with an alien egg. In all seriousness we can cling to off the wall hypothesis'. Or accept the mural is just a nod to 100% and Ufos. After all it is the most likely and actually holds evidence.

I've seen a couple of other images such as this one. I'm curious why 2 domes of the observatory are in the background, and the stairs between suggest some kind of  ascension, to me anyway. Does anyone know if these images were released before or after the game, as it makes me think of a poster that was apparently released of Payday2 which featured all the clues to unlock the big secret in that game.  This is preety interesting too http://www.crystalinks.com/cropalphabet.html ...could we mabey find some kind of translation of these if at all possible. I'm guessing since crop circles are man made then they have no meaning but some of the symbols in the second picture bear some resemblance to marking found at the hippy camp and water towers, so if we can get some meanings to them we may find some meaning to those."

(so 4,8,15,16,23,42 would become 5,8,15,16,23,42 or whatever) thats how the one guy who hurley knew from the mental hospital originally heard them.  so basically the theme of the show was- change the factors that lead to mankinds inevitable destruction, save the world (break the formula for when mankind would destroy itself) which is really quite beautiful when you consider that on a deeper level, these characters were all people who have been brought to the island, wreslting their own demons, over and over for milennia. their task was to realize their flaws, let go, and emerge better people after. change themselves, save themselves. then when you apply the fact that jacob had given all of these candidates numbers, its fits right into the larger idea of changing the numbers (the formula) saving the world.  change yourself, save yourself. save yourself, save the world  the creators of the show have admitted that the Via Domus video game is canon, so it all ties in nicely. why they never talked about any of that on the show is beyond me though. its so badass. if i wasnt clear about any of this just message me and ill break it down specifally for you. its my favorite story of all time."
chiliadmystery,38jwsv,rsears14,2,Fri Jun 5 00:54:38 2015 UTC,"i realize theyve said that, but i dont understand how the dharma  videos you unlock wouldnt be canon. obviously the main character in the game is never on the show yet interacts with the main characters from the show- that i can understand not being canon.  but the videos explain a whole aspect of the DI, which obviously would be ran by Cuse, Lindelof, maybe Abrams. Its never talked about on the show directly but the game expands on the stories of the Hanso's, which were a big unexplained presence. I dont see why that wouldnt be canon."

A hole in the centre of the disks allows them to be stacked on an axle. The disks are removable and can be mounted on the axle in any order desired. The order of the disks is the cipher key, and both sender and receiver must arrange the disks in the same predefined order. Jefferson's device had 36 disks.

chiliadmystery,38lmi5,moistboyz,2,Fri Jun 5 07:20:33 2015 UTC,"Chances are the sign is just an insider programming joke. The mural is the map to the glyphs, and we need to solve the glyphs. Maybe we have 3 meanings for them, and only solved (partly, imo) the UFO one.  Its good that people are interesting in all the other stuff, but in reality its illogical to have things like this connected to the mural. If the MC UFO was not found, then other ideas could hold weight. But as it stands, the x's are the glyphs and we need to solve them... easier said than done clearly.  Be good if you, or someone else can decode it though, as its still an interesting EE!!"

chiliadmystery,38lmi5,cwdragon,2,Fri Jun 5 02:59:54 2015 UTC,Just my opinion but i feel most people will agree with you (myself included) the mystery hasn't been fully solved so the mural could have more then one meaning or it could have nothing to do with the red eye under the platform at all and is just a red herring (i dont believe the latter at all) but only R* knows whats fact and whats crap for now.

Also maybe explore the area marked on uv map and behind where the arrow is pointing. I think for everything this is something which is very strange about the UV markings.   edit: Also if there are any alarm systems and if they are destroyable would be useful. Maybe also if you could make them attack you and then explore to see the moment when they start to attack how is that they alert the army? Is there someone who phones/pulls a alarm switch?

chiliadmystery,38jcos,IAA33,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:26:02 2015 UTC,"hello, it's been quite a time since my last lurking session, and i'm glad to see something new to me.  It seems that recently the curious Hamburger sign has gained fame again. The gibberish writings on it are weird, for sure. To me the only part that rings a bell in a raw form (aka no decypher-filter applied) is FIGO, because of Luis Figo a former Portuguese football(soccer) player in the 90's. Linking him to GTA is another thing lol  Anyway because you brought up the famous people born in Hamburg, i'd like to raise you Angela Merkel(current ruler in Germany) and Felix Mendehlsson(the wedding song guy).  Just for fun, as OP first thought to bring 3 famous people from Hamburg, i'll give you those:   i only clicked because of her first name, then laughed because of the 'task force thing' imagine the world being 157 years old, if you were to start the hunt on PS4/XB1, this Hamburger could ring a bell this one especially left me in awe, tho irrelevant, unless tinfoil is involved ofc   I'm pondering the relevance of some buildings for now, the sun+8 planet thing with the Maze Bank tower is new to me. Because of scale issues it also makes sense that Pluto wouldn't be counted as the 9th. Thx for the nitpick pappa_john  Cheers for y'all!"

I noticed these a while ago because the Gallery's sign is a weird oval (egg) shape.  I went back to it when I saw the video and noticed a version of the same poster with the far left and far right parts combined is on the back wall of the Gallery.  There is also a pillar base, like you see under Billboards etc.  I noticed around Los Santos that says 1944 on it, and the one inside the Gallery does as well."
chiliadmystery,38fhz8,Please_OP,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:01:42 2015 UTC,"I'd like to say, that it seems with this puzzle, that each piece of the puzzle, and each mural represents another piece as well. alien text hinting at when the space ships appear, murals depicting other locations in game as a coded message thats obvious yet hidden in plain sight quite well. conditions...  maybe the seeing the UFO at 3 in the storm is also part of unlocking other mystery locations - maybe they only truly appear at that time under those conditions too, which is another reason we may not be finding anything.  people apply that to yoga, to the mountain and ufos, but they dont seem to be applying it to other possibly mystery related locations, which may be part of the key   maybe its telling us hidden things appear under those conditions, sort of like the black cat deja vu in the matrix."
chiliadmystery,38fhz8,spiroth10,2,Thu Jun 4 01:24:44 2015 UTC,"Please keep in mind when reading this, things I do not cover on the painting are things I have yet to solve so please be patient. Lets start off with the colours, if you go to the helicopter pad you will notice the circles painted on the ground are coloured Red (South) and Yellow (North) if you look at the other circles around the pad they say Danger in (White) which means water. The (Orange Rustic) colour is trails, you can see this if you pull the map out from your case, to me it also resembles a fault line but that is another story all together. The green I believe the forest but I have no evidence but keep in mind that it could also mean the hills or even the city seeing as the green is sort of painted like buildings in a way. Now that the colours are figured out we can start to decipher this painting piece by piece, and I will start from left to right. On the left we have this massive looking head, well what it really is, is an outline of the top part of the map with his ear representing the Big Ear. Now If you look at the top of his head you will notice the percentage sign, that is the Up N Atom Diner. On the left side we have 4012 and 9658 below it underlined,  beside it rail road tracks and the number 88 below it. After doing some reseach on trains in Los Angeles, 9658 is the model of a coal train that operates on the Union Pacific Railway/BNSF Railway - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNSF_Railway As we make our way over to the centre painting we have the city. At the top its reads BAD HOLOGRAM UFO, this throws me off because the only hologram UFO I know of is the one on top of Mount Chiliad at 3 am but that is in the North so we would assume that it would be on the yellow part of the map. In the middle we have what looks like a compass or a target which would mean ammunation. This one is long and a bit confusing so I hope you get it but If you look at the bottom we have the letters ""JB"" in a box, please note: letters that are boxed represent buildings as you will see later in my story, but we know ""JB"" is Tonya's crack head boyfriend that we never see,  so I am thinking this is his house or workplace (If you notice when loading up the game there is a picture of Tonya standing near the car wash with the tow truck parked in front of this run downed building just west of the car wash, to me it looks like a place that a crack head would live in but after doing more research I have no evidence of this as I did not discover anything, but when I did a search around the area directly south of the car wash there is the Children of the Mountain church with the picture of Mount Chiliad above the entrance. In the left corner we have the words Hollow Hollow Hollow with one of them being underlined, please remember take all underlined words more serious especially seeing as 9658 provided me with very helpful information. So I was doing some research on eathquakes and fault lines and tunnels and I came across the following link http://www.burlingtonnews.net/tunnels2.html Now you cant see here what I am talking about but if you head over the my facebook group you can check it out there, the title of the article in the link and I mean before you click on it is ""UFO Bases, Underground Tunnels and Cities, Hollow Earth, Secret Governments..."" which makes me think the thing above ""JB"" is a tunnel or tube but again no evidence. Next we have ""Popsete Steaks"" in a box just like ""JB"" but with a corner missing, well if you look on your map and you look at the Clappers Restaurant on the Vinewood Blvd it has a sign above it that mentions steak, well if you look at the shape of the block/building, it is the exact same shape as the box Popsete Steaks is in. On the trails there is a box with a circle on top that has a J inside that is the Orange Juice stand, above that we have the words Campo Campo which stands for the camper - http://gta.wikia.com/Camper Moving over to the picture on the right we have dynamite and a trumpet which make me think sounding a horn to create an explosion but again no evidence. Above that we have a seismograph/richter scale which makes mes believe there could be a natural disaster but it could also be talking about the The Griffith Observatory https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDuwQIkiLMk Now there has been 1 new discovery made and 1 that has been confirmed, the new discovery is the pipe that runs through the oil field thank you for finding this I really appreciate it. The tower is right as well even thought I passed on the info that was suggested from a friend back in March and that is because of the frequency it emits from the top and the over all shape made me think it was the rebel radio Tower but again thank you for the confirmation. Above that there is the word Tract which in fact is a clue to let us know it can be found in the water, and beside that we have what looks like a ice cream cone with 3 scoops on top and the word cream below but that is just my opinion."

IN THE THREE IN THE IN THE PAST [underlined, maybe IN THE PACT?]   FUTUORE(TM)   4012   9658 [underlined, this one is hard to read, could be 7658 or 1658]   88 [written as if seen on a digital counter display, i.e. speedometer]   TAKE YOU   ARLAW [Cannot read this at all, took my best guess]   MIASMA [underlined]   EBONICS [underlined]   (M)   (O)   47 3/4   Segmented worm/snake image.   Two circles marked ""C"" and ""H"", these resemble Hot and Cold water taps [though taps are typically installed the opposite way, with ""H"" on the left]   Percent sign and a penny [one cent]. Maybe indicating 1/100?   Circle with a line passing through it.    Footprint outline.   Arrow pointing upwards [North maybe?]   Large drawing of a ""face"" with bone sticking out of the neck.       [Center Panel:]     BND   HOLOGRAM IMAGE [IMAGE is underlined]   LOCUS   (BUT)   (POPESEYE STEAKS)   HOLLOW   HOLLOW   HOLLOW   (JB)   (OWL)   US [over a dot inside of a square, bottom right corner]   Some type of tunnel illustration   A circle with six segments on the outer edge.   Another Picasso-style face   A ""guidepost"" with arrows pointing to the left and right.   A ""crown""?   A compass-type symbol   Three-circle cluster   Angry man waving his arms.       [Right Panel:]     BLEECKER SHNR [really not sure about this] (CAMPO) CAMPO   ???????

A hand with 8 fingers?       We see a few examples of ""sets of three"" in these panels: IN THE THREE, three panels, three-circle clusters, a three-scoop ice cream cone, three plus marks in a row, etc.   We also see some interesting mystery-related keywords being used: TRACT, HOLLOW, HOLOGRAM IMAGE, as well as other interesting phrases like CAMPO, GUSHER, POPESEYE STEAKS, LOCUS, BLEECKER, (HAND)BONE, etc."

It's a possible land/sea distinction, splitting the two.  That would back up my theory that the Hamburger code is telling us to go to block F6, it's half land half water.

I choose 3am for the obvious UFO reasons but also because I think the altruists sacrifice the young non tech users just before sunrise.  This is what I'm going for in my play through. Drunk couple, drunk guy needs a ride, runaway bride. That's 4 people and should trigger the fight so I can get at that crate.   This is assuming this will even make a difference to anything. This whole search could be a sham and the easter egg.   I haven't explored the moon cycle stuff. What I have noticed is that I naturally run into certain strangers at certain times during a play through, and now I'm making myself think I already messed up because what if you fluidly play the game, the moon cycles match the missions and when you get the strangers and stuff. Like certain mission cut to certain times of the day so when I do a play through I try and sync my missions. This caused me to end a mission and happen upon the drunk couple at the perfect time to get them to the camp at 3am. It was like destiny."

To me, the images look a lot like copy/pasted textures, since the same groups of 2 and 4 crop up on the mural again and again - what's more interesting to me are the 'blank' spaces, which look a lot like a crossword-puzzle than anything else... Now, I count 58 'blanks' on the mural, and there are 42 'missing' letters (+ 1 numeral) counted so far, right, leaving 16 unaccounted for... how many characters are on the Hamburger sign again? 13 letters + 8 Numerals + 1 Symbol...  It doesn't quite add up... but it's so close as to be tantalizing... I don't know maybe you 'leave out' the numbers, or something? Maybe we're missing a few missing letters... or... who knows :P"

chiliadmystery,38cbwt,PTR47,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:07:47 2015 UTC,"I noted that one a month(ish) ago, as it didn't seem to be included in the older posts about this.  I had an idea that the letters would appear IN ORDER, in the way you encountered them in the game, through missions, cut-scenes, and character swaps (like after being fired by Simeon, switching to Franklin finds him on the phone to Lamar, while looking directly at the LS Paper Co sign.)  Spent 3 hours watching a play-through on youtube, theory didn't pan out. I could have easily missed some, though."
chiliadmystery,38cbwt,EnergyTurtle23,2,Thu Jun 4 00:39:54 2015 UTC,"Here's a similar analysis, using numerals instead of letters. We have sixteen unique symbols...maybe hexadecimal?    1 = handle it well 2 = lovehearts 3 = happyface 4 = flower 5 = sun 6 = tree 7 = redlove 8 = god 9 = help me 10 = mountain 11 = pink 12 = red circle 13 = moon 14 = orange+green 15 = dark/light 16 = UKflag    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 4 8 6 9 10 5 9 5 11 12 10 13 14 7 4 8 6 3 14 15 1 16 9 5 11 4 8 2 3 15 1 10 12 15 1 10 12 2 3 14 13 2 3 14 13    Common Clusters:    7 4 8 6 (2x)    2 3 (4x)     15 1 10 12 (2x, repeated twice on one line)     2 3 14 13 (2x, repeated twice on one line)    Notice that the UKflag symbol (16) only appears once in the entire mural. That is unusual.    Also notice that bottom four lines are all equal length, four lines with eight symbols each. Our UKflag symbol appears as the first symbol of the second line.      Using Hex For Better Pattern Visualization:    An arbitrary conversion of these symbols to hexadecimal, to better visualize possible patterns:   Symbol -> Hex    1 = 00 2 = 01 3 = 02 4 = 03 5 = 04 6 = 05 7 = 06 8 = 07 9 = 08 10 = 09 11 = 0a 12 = 0b 13 = 0c 14 = 0d 15 = 0e 16 = 0f    Converting the mural this way, the symbols would look something like this:   00 01 02 03 04 05 06 03 07 05 08 09 04 08 04 0a 0b 09 0c 0d 06 03 07 05 02 0d 0e 00 0f 08 04 0a 03 07 01 02 0e 00 09 0b 0e 00 09 0b 01 02 0d 0c 01 02 0d 0c      Split into sections:    00 01 02 03 04 05 06 03 07 05 08 09 04 08 04 0a 0b 09 0c 0d 06 03 07 05 02 0d 0e    00 0f 08 04 0a 03 07 01 02 0e    00 09 0b 0e     00 09 0b 01 02 0d 0c 01 02 0d 0c    Notice that if we treat the ""00"" hex as the start of a new section, we get three sections that start with ""00"" and end with ""0e"", and one section that starts with ""00"" and ends with ""0c"". This is an interesting pattern, it reminds me of punctuation and capitalization in English. The ""00"" symbol occurs at the beginning, and then only occurs again when it is preceded by the ""0e"" symbol."

chiliadmystery,38cs96,zeroFG,2,Wed Jun 3 19:55:50 2015 UTC,Is there a link to the debunking of the Manson house?  Just curious what was decided about it.
chiliadmystery,38cs96,NeonNoire,3,Wed Jun 3 21:47:34 2015 UTC,"I'll look for one, but the entire argument in favor of it being the ""Manson House"" (which itself is vague, since Manson spent much of his time at a compound in Death Valley) hinged on there being seven murders and eighteen ""Family"" members. However, there's no official count for how many ""Family"" members Manson had. The count is anywhere between 10 to 24 members including Manson himself. If Rockstar wanted to reference Manson, they wouldn't use a vague number that has little to no connection to Manson (literally one digit out of four).   They probably believed that the house was meant to resemble the Polanski/Tate house, where the Family's most notorious murder took place. There is virtually no resemblance, the front gate looks vaguely similar, but beyond that the architecture is nothing like either the original house or the replacement house which stands there today. The placement of the house within the city does not match up either:   The French country-style structure was located on 3 acres (1.2 ha) at the end of a cul-de-sac on Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, an area west of Hollywood in the Santa Monica Mountains that overlooks Beverly Hills and Bel Air.[1] The hillside structure faced east and featured stone fireplaces, beamed ceilings, paned windows, a loft above the living room, a swimming pool and a guest house and was surrounded by thick pine trees and flowering cherry.[1]   I'm not saying that 1807 doesn't relate to this house, though. That seems just as likely as it being some other street address to me, since it's a fairly large and isolated property for the area, and immediately in the direction that the red arrow is pointing."
chiliadmystery,38cs96,Waterypyro,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:09:38 2015 UTC,I see.  I knew why people thought there was the connection.  I do think it looks very much like the house in question (some youtube videos show it well).  The driveway is mirrored but the front of the house is in pretty similar style and it being on the hillside.  Anything about the people being insta-killed when walking into them?  The couple times I've scoped out the place it has been vacant.
chiliadmystery,38cs96,NeonNoire,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:13:57 2015 UTC,"What is the solution?  Gonna go ahead and say the Manson thing is nonsense, after just reading up on the Tate murder.

chiliadmystery,388aqj,wicro,12,Tue Jun 2 15:46:57 2015 UTC,"A bunch of signs around the city have missing letters. Like this sign, it's pretty obvious they were put into the game on purpose. I bet they fit into this riddle somehow. Maybe we are supposed to gather all of the missing letters and use them in conjunction with this sign.   Searching through past posts, it seems attempts have been made to gather some of the missing letters from signs. There are MANY signs missing letters (like over 50). The searches really weren't organized and they simply gathered the letters from random signs and put them together in one big group. see here: https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/20ki63/the_missing_letters/  I think there was a fatal flaw with that logic.   The missing letters are presented on the signs in several unique ways. For example the church signs are simply missing a letter. Some billboards have letters that do not light up at night. Some neon signs have letters that do not light up. Some signs have a misspelled word with one extra letter. Some signs have a letter that's clearly different (ie underlined, capitalized, different font, reversed, bold, ect).  I believe we have to segregate the letters by groups somehow and rearrange them to form words. These words will fit into the hamburger sign to form a clue.  So far the only thing I came across was that all of the church sign letters form the word FALSE. Grouping all of the motel sign letters together may form another word.  I think we need to come together to find and list all of these signs by groups. Using a big and/or interactive map with locations and images of each sign would definitely help to limit duplicates and confusion."

It's just sort of a treat to everyone that enjoys the value of such a thing. You could also look at it as a huge social experiment, where multiple communities (gamers, professional programmers, puzzle hobbyists, etc.) must come together to figure every detail out."
chiliadmystery,388aqj,Huge_Dabs,4,Tue Jun 2 18:04:14 2015 UTC,"They purposely used proprietary software to render the code almost unreadable. From what I understand, unscrambling the code is similar to a NP problem, meaning we basically guess the function/variable/everything names and can verify them in poly time.  Granted someone would need to create some program to verify these, and that might not really even take poly time, could be NP in itself for verification.  Either way, at best ""unraveling"" the code to run the game is NP proof and Poly verify and at worst, NP proof with NP verify.  Unless Rockstar set out to have someone solve the P=NP problem, no, they didn't want us to ""unravel"" their code.  People can guess and check, (NP proof P verify), which turns up some results, but I don't think that's how rockstar intended it to be solved."

chiliadmystery,3898tr,LaFlame300,3,Tue Jun 2 19:36:08 2015 UTC,I'm not really sure since it's so cryptic. I think the hamburger sign somehow forms several words. I think we need to then take the words formed from missing sign letters (like FALSE) and put them all together. Moving the words around should form a sentence. The Mural I posted may be a guide as to the order of the words.

chiliadmystery,38979p,NeonNoire,0,Tue Jun 2 19:04:03 2015 UTC,We learn what each of the circles means so we can decrypt it. If a certain circle means A and another mean K then you can slowly figure out the entire code. There are other words as well.

I'm not a hunter and I haven't contributed anything at all as I just watch from the sidelines, but for goodness sake can we stop re-visiting theories that have been repeatedly debunked.  Also the yellow plane in GTAV is a crop duster based in Grapeseed airfield for agriculture.

But something weird happened after looking at these symbols the way you posted them, by themselves, and I got a strange idea. I read a post on GTA V Forums, and this guy had posted a chart of moon phases/orbits which looked similar. But the fact that there's 3 circles, makes me think that Earth is one of those. Possibly our planetary alignment with other things could affect the way we see things. I've noticed while exploring around Chiliad, that the shadows and and angles play all kinds of tricks when your start analyzing things. At 3pm in the afternoon, I cold make out arrows and X's all over the mountain, but an hour later, and the mountain looks normal again. I've got a funny feeling that where the sun rests in the sky, and from which direction you are looking, maybe we'll be able to see what the Glyph is trying to show us. And on the other hand, the alignment of the Moon would play into the spotting of the different Ufos.

But at night they light up and are bulbs, idk it always stuck out to me and reminded me of the Our/UR path is lit.  To respond to the images you posted I'm starting to think those little glyphs are representing the world. Like the Earth in the center with either the moon as the outside dots or the Sun. Some are uncolored dots and some of those are colored, maybe it's saying New moon and Full moon or New/Full moon and Sun.  Idk for some reason I'm seeing it as a sequence of alignments. Like see the Chiliad UFO in this certain moon phase and alignment, then do the same thing the next night with the corresponding alignment.  Funny how the only requirement for the Chiliad UFO is weather and time (along w/ 100%), but no moon phase. No one finds it odd that some of the Glyphs contain a moon in a specific phase but so as far as we all know the Chiliad UFO does not require a moon phase?  Maybe it requires a specific sequence of moon phases. Idk that all could be a stretch but it's something I've never thought of.   Also I keep in mind the alien HUD and the alien rune glyphs like if those ringed around the Hippy Camp were trying to speak a language to us they would look like that, and if not they would be in like a morse code type thing, that's just why I see it as alignments."

Check the real life location first, it's very likely that detail is entirely unimportant. As for the sign itself, or more accurately the text, that is blatantly relevant. When you're looking for weird things you'll find them, like that overpass near the airport looking like an infinity symbol may seem important until you realize it's a real location. Also the same sign might be for a business that is no longer there. The sign looks 60's-esque, it's probably old. There's a sign in a local city near me for a nightclub that was bulldozed in the late 80's, for example. Sign and property still there, grass still gets mowed too."

chiliadmystery,382hlk,deltaninethc420,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:27:41 2015 UTC,I would assume the sign is for the mojito inn. The sign doesnt say its a restaurant it just says famous hamburgers...and I do not see an eye here at all. The only thing I notice is the sign under the hamburgers sign that had a bunch of jumbled words and symbols on it....thanks squidd I never noticed this before.
chiliadmystery,382hlk,KillaPam,-1,Mon Jun 1 17:28:08 2015 UTC,The sign has seven dashes 5 on top and 2 on bottom just like the Eye atop the Mural and it is on a pole that has a square box with cryptic text in it. Looks just like the line connected from the Eye to the Egg.   Maybe unlocking this text will lead us to the Egg.

chiliadmystery,3827xv,dwlater,2,Mon Jun 1 10:09:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think I can agree with #3.  How do we know something is mystery related, until the mystery is solved?  Sure, we don't need threads like ""Check out this sick jump I did from the Maze Bank tower"", but I see nothing wrong with ""This NPC just did something weird, has anyone seen this?""   Caveat: yes, use the Search bar first.  As I already started quoting some of Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (the Douglas Adams book) in the the Ballerina Guy Dancer thread today, let me quote some more:  ""The term ‘holistic’ refers to my conviction that what we are concerned with here is the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. I do not concern myself with such petty things as fingerprint powder, telltale pieces of pocket fluff and inane footprints. I see the solution to each problem as being detectable in the pattern and web of the whole. The connections between causes and effects are often much more subtle and complex than we with our rough and ready understanding of the physical world might naturally suppose.""  “Don't you understand that we need to be childish in order to understand? Only a child sees things with perfect clarity, because it hasn't developed all those filters which prevent us from seeing things that we don't expect to see.”   “Sherlock Holmes observed that once you have eliminated the impossible then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the answer. I, however, do not like to eliminate the impossible.”"
chiliadmystery,3827xv,NeonNoire,2,Mon Jun 1 23:08:04 2015 UTC,"Some of these seem counterproductive. Forcing people to search for and use an ongoing thread isn't a good idea for a few reasons: not everyone keeps up with and reads those threads, it's too time-consuming, people get overwhelmed, and information gets buried.   Putting limits on what may or may not be ""mystery related"" seems difficult when we know so little. Anything could be relevant. All clues found should be shared: the poster may not see the connection, but someone else with more info/ability to recognize patterns might.  This is why we need a) as much genuine information as possible, and b) as many eyes on that information as possible.   I agree with using the search function. Having a What We Know cheat sheet stickied might be a good idea - something with keywords and short blurbs that can be scanned over quickly.   Giving locations for clues, if known, is imperative.  Mods should be removing irrelevant threads and editing titles if necessary."
chiliadmystery,3827xv,crustpunker,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:04:37 2015 UTC,"Ok guys points taken. But in my opinion I think that if there is a mystery R* would have built it with a certain degree of logic, and all I'm saying is that if you've noticed something strange try and figure out a way to link that back into the mystery, I think some people just spot things and then race off onto here to share it without putting any ideas forwards.  I'm all for out of the box thinking but there still has to be a little bit of logic behind it. To use an example of a post I made sometime ago, I decided to start following the 3 guys who look like CJ, Rider, and sweet during hood safari. Didn't amount to much but I was led to ""sightings"" restaurant near the airport which is a bit ufo shaped, and I decided to do this on the basis that mabey the Jetpack guy on the mural is meant to represent CJ. And when I posted this I gave as much detail on how I'd arrived at this conclusion as possible. now If I'd logged on a just put ""this guy looks like CJ what's that about"" then I would have just been told it's an Easter egg to SA and nothing more.  And the reason I say to look for a currently active thread (currently active being the key phrase here) is that I've logged and seen multiple post all basically about the same thing, and since they are all active then in my opinion theres no reason to not combine there efforts into one thread. I'm not trying to stifle  or offend anyone, I'm not trying to say we shouldn't have ideas I'm just trying to encourage people to do a bit more digging into things and to look at things and mabey try to draw their own conclusions. I agree we don't know a great deal about the mystery, but I don't think its hard to see when somethings possibly related."

chiliadmystery,38207q,rsears14,4,Mon Jun 1 07:37:38 2015 UTC,Well from what I recall (haven't played in a while) there are quite a few instances of automated/unique peds/vehicles throughout the game. For example the drunk guy who stumbles out of the garage during the mission where you have to repossess the bike. Their there to give the game a more realistic feel.   And to be honest one of the problems I find around here is that people want to just assume that anything could be related to the mystery. Rather than looking for things with a logical approach.
chiliadmystery,38207q,Diabolic73,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:56:21 2015 UTC,"the irony with the drunk guy example you gave is he actually mentions something that's relevant to the mystery, he calls franklin and lamar ""Zapho agents"" which is the deity the Altruists and Andy Moon believe is coming back to earth to punish everyone for their greed."

chiliadmystery,37uqyw,DreamingDjinn,3,Sat May 30 23:14:17 2015 UTC,"Definately looks like they are related. Maybe that little black star under the graffiti apple is like a special spot? Anyways, nice find."
chiliadmystery,37uqyw,TheHerpfulDerp,2,Sun May 31 09:52:25 2015 UTC,"They're definitely too similar for it to be a simple coincidence. The thing that bothers me is that we've associated the Mirror Park is an apple/heart, but the picture seems to imply that it's a strawberry, which might invalidate the Epsilon tract connection. It might be worth looking into 1807 around Mirror Park though, especially near where the asterisk is in the graffiti as it relates to the Appleberry heart."

I've seen it in multiple places, and it's all over the place in Strawberry, in both red and black ink. I think it's just to ""rep"" Strawberry.    I poked around the area of the map I think corresponds to the asterisk, didn't see much ... a path behind the houses there with graffiti I can't really read. I saw a few large white-out spots on the stone wall there - my first thought was to shine the space docker lights on them, but I think that might be a stretch."

There doesn't seem to be much to the red strawberry, but the black one is much more interesting. The * under the strawberry seems to be a power plant in Mirror Park, though what we need to do with power plants in general is anyone's guess at this point. There's also an interesting path that leads from the roads of the shape down to said power plant.      This is all assuming of course there even IS anything for us to do with power plants. Right now I'd like to find the wall with 1807, even if the number doesn't mean anything. I'd also like to go to the Vinewood sign to see if the graffiti is black or red.

Multiple people have claimed to have also heard these sounds, mostly in the NW corner of the map, but  a few other random spots as well. The wiki says many people have heard them while driving along the Blaine county/Los Santos border late at night, where the radio stations change. I've yet to see any threads or videos about hearing them on Blaine county border, so I don't know where the wiki is getting that info.  I have tried reproducing the occurence, but have yet to be successful.   There are two images associated with these number transmissions: one is a famous photo of earth from space, and the other is a HUD image.   I'm not sure if these occurrences are legit or not, but they haven't been proven to be either real or fake as of now.   I have heard the static when u drive out of range of BCR, and I've heard cellphone interference while driving through tunnels, but never any numbers or voices.

What SSTV does, is listen for the difference between ""high frequency sound"" and no sound, and what that frequency is; it doesn't matter (to a point) how muddled it is, as long as it can be identified.   It's kind of like Morse Code; no matter how distorted it is, you can still read the message if you can identify the dots and dashes.  So, short of hashing the images, you can't really say this guy absolutely didn't run his own decoder on the SSTV signal! The picture should look exactly the same!"

chiliadmystery,37rvxd,_TomEE_,4,Fri May 29 22:49:14 2015 UTC,Assets like a Jetpack would require a texture and maybe a script defining the behaviour. Probably no more than a few mbs.

chiliadmystery,37rvxd,SN4T14,2,Sat May 30 22:14:29 2015 UTC,True. But it's a lot easier to hide something which isn't a game asset but is more like a loc of code in a trigger file or something. Depends on the framework they used.
chiliadmystery,37rvxd,SN4T14,2,Sun May 31 01:36:27 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""a trigger file""?   Depends on the framework they used.   Do you do PHP dev by any chance? Because the term ""framework"" is used mainly by PHP devs, and that term's barely even used when talking about game dev.  It also doesn't matter what you're hiding, the hard part is hiding it, not so much the size of it, as long as you have the code to activate it hidden well, hiding the rest is easy because you can e.g. have the code grab all the assets and code for what you've activated from one of your servers, or you could hide the data and code inside an executable or art file."

The only thing that matters is that the Trigger and/or location for those assets still need to be in the code. OR it should load a part of the code dynamicly from an other source. in that case, the url should also be in this code...   Long story short. Even if there is stuff hidden, it source still needs to be in the code for it to be there. (this is logical ofcourse).

I was doing some photography in Lester's place for a future post, and noticed some things misprinted in the paper like 'Los Sandtos' in the title of a newspaper, or the missing 4 on the keypad in the Fleeca marked on Lester's map that got me thinking this might be like the puzzle in Lemony Snicket (remember that one?) where a secret message was deciphered from deliberate spelling mistakes in a letter from a meticulous speller. I have loads of pictures, I just need to actually upload them. Anyone else notice things like missing or extra numerals/letters?

Many people would have to 100% their game again to use 1 vehicle. I also think that Franklin is the one who gets to find it because SPOILERS of the choices you make at the end of the game with Trevor and Michael.

Great find I truly believe now that thise observatory shadows are really there due to this find with shadow in the extra box! I made post here about shadows and made post about the shadows lining up with the plates at the observatory representing planet Uranus (which is also mentioned at hippy camp and all throughtout the game)

I made a post here about the shadows at observatory looking like the eye glyphs and possibly telling us an eclipse. So if those observatory shadow dials are just that then the hippy camp would need shadows from things to point out things in the puzzle. Which the sun is pointing to karma at 3pm or the shadows you see here during moonlight points to something else...check the pole next to ufo car during this moonlight and see what word its pointing to on the wall. Maybe another pole in that camp lines with something too.

Common examples of this are seeing images of animals or faces in clouds, the man in the moon, the moon rabbit, and hearing hidden messages on phonograph records when they are played in reverse.  Pareidolia is the visual form of apophenia, which is the perception of patterns within random data. Combined with apophenia and hierophany (manifestation of the sacred), pareidolia may have helped ancient societies organize chaos and make the world intelligible.

One cannot take a compiled software program, and turn it into the same code the developers wrote (Unless it's .net and the code can be seen using a reflector). You can do that more so with scripts but actual executables and libraries have to be stepped through with a debugger, which does not give you the code the software developers wrote but rather machine code (which is not human ""readable"").  You are definitely right though that we shouldn't mark a lot of stuff off as debunked when going this route because as you said the person might not be entirely competent  It's definitely entails a high level of difficulty.

The UFO and Jetpack are connected to indicate that you can view UFOs by flying up and meeting the conditions of the glyphs. The rest of the lines on the mural seem pointless, just there to distract us.

It's possible there are more red glyphs, 5 or 7, or maybe there are only the 3 lines on the white glyphs to show 3 ufos flying.

If the white glyph's 3 lines instructed us that 3AM is an important time, then perhaps the top one is instructing us about something at 7AM, or perhaps 5:20AM (5 on top, 2 on bottom). Or... more disappointingly, 5-2 = 3AM."
chiliadmystery,37mcw5,cocogen2003,2,Thu May 28 19:06:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for pointing out 5 on top and 2 on bottom. Has to relate in some way. Could be 7:00 or even 5:20. I think if it was only 5-2 = 3 for 3:00 a.m. the mural would only have 3 lines on both versions of the glyph. If it was 5 white + 2 red though, then this could be a dead end still.  The glyphs are far from solved imo. Two of them are still vague at best.    1 Top of Mountain 2 Rain 3 Night time (3:00 a.m.) 4 Eye by itself? 5 Sideways one?   EDIT: Also the #3 Night Time Glyph has an additional 3 lines for 3 am. So 3 lines vs 7 lines may still be a clue and not a dead end."
chiliadmystery,37mcw5,cocogen2003,2,Thu May 28 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"I think there's more to those 2 faded ones than ""eye by itself"" and ""sideways eye."" If you look very carefully below/above them, there is another drawing that is very severely faded. You can make out a very slight hint of white to the lower right of the bottom left eye, and above the bottom right eye.  http://i.imgur.com/sVZHLwH.jpg  Has anyone sat at these faded glyphs for 24 hours? I'm wondering if in the perfect lighting/weather they'd become more visible."
chiliadmystery,37mcw5,Rflkt,1 point,Thu May 28 20:02:42 2015 UTC,"I see what you are saying, 2 more conditions may need to be met. But these faded white glyphs are to push you search for more? Possibly the color versions?"

I've spent a good amount of time researching this mystery and I definitely think something is going on. But I just cannot figure it out yet. There is a lot of spooky symbolism at the Galileo Observatory (e.g. two of the ""not an entrance"" doors open their peep holes at 8:45 PM, there is a sniper on the back balcony looking out over the Penris building. ""Shoot for the stars"" refers to this location and if you look through the sniper scope, you can see the stars on the Penris building's sign, the metal plates on the ground are shaped like eggs, etc...)  Also, Fort Zancudo is really perplexing, to say the least. There are several elevators there, but none are functional. Though they do all say the floor is -1. Also, there is an email pulled up on all of the computers in Zancudo, but I can't make out what it says. I'd love to know what this says, as it might give us a clue.   Just some starting points.

Even here, everything should be taken with a grain of salt. ...especially here, actually! ;)"
chiliadmystery,37c3gz,GiantSquidd,2,Tue May 26 16:18:08 2015 UTC,"Even things in the game itself are sometimes not good representations of what the game was envisioned to be.  I just made a comment outlining my thoughts on the final spaceship parts cutscene and the several mistakes they made throughout development of it - it is the victim of poor planning and production, which is partly why there is so much confusion about the spaceship parts.  They are written as spaceship parts, but they are not used as spaceship parts, they are used as power sources. But none of the written/recorded dialogue supports this.  It's most likely retconned, because they didn't want to re-write and re-record dialogue when they decided not to spend time/money to animate 50 parts coming together into a ship (which would be one of the most fantastic animations in the whole game, if they had done it).  Retconning small scenes is often done when a project is over-budget and over-time, and I think this scene was a victim of retconning  Longer post http://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/375lxa/what_omega_builds_coming_to_a_conclusion_on_the/crlqd65  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroactive_continuity  And taking it a step further, I think retconning may explain many unexplained parts of this mystery (Altruist cult comes to mind, it feels VERY retconned).  Heck the whole mystery itself may be a retconned storyline which got cut out - and they just picked and chose assets from it to create a pale representation of the original vision for the story.  If that's the case, we might see it come back in DLC form."
chiliadmystery,37c3gz,freehaircuts,3,Tue May 26 21:01:38 2015 UTC,"Retroactive continuity:       Retroactive continuity, or retcon for short,   is the alteration of previously established facts in the continuity of a fictional work.   There are various motivations for retconning. The changes may occur to accommodate sequels or derivative works, allowing newer authors or creators to revise the diegetic (in-story) history to include a course of events that would not have been possible in the story's original continuity. Retcons allow for authors to reintroduce popular characters and resolve errors in chronology.  Retcons are common in pulp fiction, especially in comic books published by long-established publishers such as DC and Marvel. The long history of popular titles and the number of writers who contribute stories can often create situations that demand clarification or revision. Retcons also appear in manga, soap operas, serial dramas, movie sequels, professional wrestling angles, video games, radio series, and other forms of serial fiction.

chiliadmystery,37bjm0,Ghosticus,3,Tue May 26 17:04:11 2015 UTC,"Indeed it is, not just in this way of naming convention. I forget the name of the middleware used to obfuscate their binaries now, but it's a serious wrapper that claims ""more than just a wrapper"" and their main point is their ""novel"" obfuscation techniques. I remember there were things hidden in the GTASA exe, too. I forget what they were, but it was really a 5mb exe iirc and it has an extra 8mb of data in there for something, not necessarily some secret, just, stuff was in the exe that was odd and made people wonder why it was there instead of in the archives, I just don't remember clearly, but suffice it to say, it would take a serious serious effort to gleam anything from the gta v exe, regardless of whatever was found in the SA one. Pinch of salt and don't get too excited, I forget the significance of the past, and could never guess about what is in the GTA V exe. Ironically, I never looked at this one's size.  [looks]  Wow, it's 50mb. That's kind of odd for a game that historically kept very small exe's other than SA which stood out as big (and again, really wasn't that big). I can see it being large, but that large is rather odd. And depending on how good the obfuscation middleware is, it could hold any number of things we'd just probably never be able to see without some special key because it's a proprietary obfuscation system. The size is puzzling.  I'm googling around. I've been to the site. I've seen the tech used, I just can't find it now. It's becoming popular as far as the titles they were displaying that use it. Sorry for the failure there, but the main thing for me at this point is look at that filesize on the exe. I can imagine an obfuscator bloating things, and in some cases, even compressing, but 50mb is rather flippin large for an exe from gta. Something's in it, and we can't see it. Maybe. :o  Doesn't mean a whole lot, it might be perfectly explainable. But we'll hopefully see."

I have a theory that if you olay ur characters right u will get a buzzard corresponding with that characters color. I also think these colors indicate how we played that character. For example: most common is black, i think this means evil. I got white ones with frank and trevor but orange with mike leading me to believe that i played mike too evil and got trevors color. Ive heard of others getting orange with frank. I think white means we played too pure, like Rstar is saying Ha! Not that easy buck-o. Ive also ran across people in this sub with green buzzards.

I know what I'd do but I wanna know what [Niko] would do.  You designed him so you know him better than I do.” – Mike Sean Clifton  That’s a very interesting question. The choices that you make in Grand Theft Auto IV while in the shoes of Niko Bellic are completely down to personal preference. Your conscience and curiosity help Niko to make decisions throughout the game, so we really don’t have a straight and true path for how the Niko ‘character’ would react in life or death situations – it’s all down to the individual who plays him, and our hope was to have a fairly even split in all of the choices, so they seemed like real dilemmas. In terms of outcomes (something Niko would not know at the time) there is a ‘best pathway’ which is the sort of thing we reveal when we do a tips post, but that is from a pure game design / mechanics perspective as some choices give you more advantages than others, not from the choices Niko might make at the time.

chiliadmystery,376dwk,kultrazero,3,Mon May 25 13:23:24 2015 UTC,"Everything about the final scene with Omega is so weird.   What is Omega doing with the spaceship parts/power sources? We can see them all on his shelves, so has he not actually used them yet? He says ""I have put together this ship to their exact specifications."" Is he talking about the small ufo on his desk? If so, the scene never shows him applying the final piece to the ufo. He sets the piece on his desk, touches the ufo, it hovers momentarily, and he leaves. Was that really all he wanted to do? That's why he had Franklin find the pieces? It doesn't make sense.   What are the parts, anyway? They have to be either cases that house the actual parts, or they're ""power sources"" (I can't remember where this theory came from, but I remember seeing it here somewhere). These 50 identical boxes can't possibly be the ""spaceship parts"" themselves, right? So if that's the case, Omega must have lied about them being the crashed fragments of the UFO that came for him. That just doesn't make sense.   Why does he say ""I'll see you on the other side""? As it is, we never see him again. Is he just using a super hippy-dippy way to say see you later or are we supposed to infer some deeper meaning?   Is the space docker really all we get for all our hard work hunting down parts all over the damn place?! Omega never even mentions it but it's the only thing you can interact with in that garage as far as we can tell. It seems like a funny dune buggy decorated with lights and trash cans that kinda resembles an x-wing isn't enough to justify hunting down all those parts. There has to be more to it, right?   ...but what if there isn't more to it, and it's cryptic and ridiculous just for the sake of being cryptic and ridiculous.

I have no idea what Omega is doing with these parts, if they were in fact the parts of a spaceship then wouldn't the cutscene be more like him placing the final part on something that actually resembles a spaceship? There is no indication in this scene that these pieces we've collected have anything to do with that mini spaceship... he just holds it in his hand... is this final part just powering it up? And yeah these look nothing like broken pieces of a UFO, who knows what they are.  As for the space docker I've always believed this is a fake prize, this is why I'm interested to find out if taking the docker counts as a stolen car. But I firmly believe there is more to be rewarded, there's just way too much weird shit that can't be ignored."
chiliadmystery,376dwk,head_bussin,2,Wed May 27 10:52:31 2015 UTC,"Yo I just replayed that mission. I think we have to take the space docker. I checked the social club and it doesn't count as a stolen car. That last piece is to power up the SD, the ship he put together to their exact specifications."

I'm still not convinced the SD is a real piece of the puzzle. I imagine it would be funny to R* knowing we're running around LS honking at things with a weird horn.   While I,m on the subject, have u ever noticed the space docker green lights anywhere else in-game? Not including the FZ UFO of course."

chiliadmystery,375lxa,rsears14,3,Mon May 25 02:08:10 2015 UTC,Thing I find weird is that the parts have a model of a pyramid on. The same pyramid is on the Artifact. It is also labeled Pyramid on the artifact. The other 2 things on the Artifact are named Pilot and UFO. What do we do with that into?

So those can't be the ones you collected anyways.

chiliadmystery,375lxa,clouds_become_unreal,1 point,Tue May 26 18:57:01 2015 UTC,"My point in all this is that Rockstar doesn't always give us a realistic or good representation of everything that is supposed to be happening in the story of the game.  The story, as written by the scriptwriters / directors of the game, is that Omega is supposed to be filling this little garage with the spaceship parts, but the game developers/designers didn't feel it was necessary or were too lazy to evidence that in the actual universe of the game.  They probably thought no one would be able to see through the cracks in the garage door, or if they did, ""fuck it whatever it's not that important"".  Taking this a step further, the entire finale cutscene is actually really badly done, if you look at it critically, from perspective that the designers are trying to show what the script writers are telling them to show. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGItfRhrvrE  Franklin hands the final piece to Omega, and he says ""The last piece! I have gotten every other piece you sent through, except this one.  I have put together this ship to their exact specifications.""  So he already had the ship built, before he got the last part?  This is the first thing which makes no sense.  So the designers tried to realize this by making it look like the parts were somehow part of a power grid, even though the dialogue which was written and recorded by the voice actors doesn't support that at all.  But they had to do SOMETHING with the parts, because Omega says the ship is really small, and they can't think of any budget-sensible way to animate 50 parts being compressed into a small ship.  We then see Omega carry the piece into the garage, and he then places it on top of what is clearly just a box without any input port to receive the part.  The animators / designers didn't plan ahead and make room in the power grid that runs throughout the rest of the garage for one final part - so this is their solution, just plop it down on this box.  The final part never gets connected like all the other parts are connected, and it never lights up like all the other parts light up.  This is the 2nd mistake / intentional laziness in the cutscene  Then he touches the little UFO and it comes to life, and you can see that his eyes track it for only a moment, and then instead of continuing to watch this fascinating thing in front of him (keep in mind this is an actor on a motion capture set with no real point of reference) he does a weird dance/fidget where he rolls his head around on his shoulders (UFO still flying and doing fantastic things, but he doesnt care), and then when he's done fidgeting, he walks out of the room, all in one really fast and undramatic motion captured sequence.  Like that's the best/only take they got in the motion capture studio, and they just said fuck it and moved on, because this scene wasn't important to them.  Everything about this scene makes it feel rushed/incomplete and not a good representation of what it was originally envisioned to be.  I don't pretend to know what it was originally envisioned to be, but from a storytelling standpoint, the mistakes in dialogue and lack of attention to detail in animation and general lack of direction in the scene makes it a terrible production.  Even a film student like myself can point out these flaws. It's sad that we got this cheap scene instead of a more highly planned and fleshed out cutscene.  We may never know what the original vision for this scene was supposed to be, before it was retconned into what we see now.  Apparently it was good enough for release though."

While walking to the building where the space docker is, Omega says ""I've put together this ship in their exact specifications. Then Omega walks next to the table in this cut scene, and doesn't see Franklin looking at the Space docker when he says ""man you crazy motherfucker."" and Omega replies ""Isn't it incredible?"" thinking Franklin meant this little mini ufo.     Then Omega connects the last part to the machine and the mini ufo starts flying. Omega never even looks or mentions the Space docker, like it's nothing special. Built of all kind of trash with leds and weird sound effects, nothing high technology.     So, mini ufo is complete and Omega walks away saying ""see you on the other side, brother."" So in my opinion, we shouldn't even take the Space docker like the Reddit post above suggests, but instead do something with the mini ufo and figure out what Omega means with ""see you on the other side, brother.""

I've relied on what I know is there from pictures of them from others. So, if there is any code, how many of us just needed to get social club snaps of all 5 places or something? Wow, what if everyone working together on it, has produced an out-of-game library of what is in the game, but no one has actually visited all the glyphs and/or took pics of them all, or just something similar to those?

He looks like he needs help - maybe robbing in necessity, from a rich girl, so perhaps he's innocent for that reason.

The egg is hatching on the mural, and the Dr tells michael ""We'll crack you yet"" (like - you guessed it - an egg shell!) among other very interesting things in his first text to him, he says he'll ""crack him yet"".  https://youtu.be/TkaJO0WFoh8?t=164  That FBI agent in that movie's name is ""Hatcher"". Which someone showed me not long ago. That fits the theme of the Haines/FIB saving the world and lying to the public to ""protect"" them in GTA V (quotes because it's not really protection to lie to people). The more I look for myself, the more I see I was already told and doubted already without even understanding what I was being told, I am learning that, whether we can unlock something or not, there is a deeper meaning to all of this.  We're the eggs. We're supposed to hatch when we understand this game. I think. That's what I was told, and the more I search and more I see my discoveries I make are already here and didn't pan out, it suddenly makes more sense than anything I've ever read about the hunt, and anything I've ever come up with.  ""I guess nothing is what it seemed to be, huh?"" - Indeed, Hatcher, indeed.  Game is based on endless list of movies and songs, too. The more I read from all places the mystery is written about, the more I believe it's something bigger than a video game secret. It's a real-world secret! I was told specifically by someone that the game is used to ""circumvent censorship"" and relies on ""the smartest and most knowledgeable GTA fans to explain metaphors for others"" - I'm starting to believe him more than ever before. I did a lot of back-reading here tonight. Nothing adds up - but the stuff I was told, does. It's freaky. But kind of awesome, too. I'm just not sure I grasp it enough to explain it. But I am seeing things I didn't see before. And one person is to thank for that (or to blame, depending how I look at it any given time haha).  Alls I can say is that I was shown a writings somewhere else before and I read it myself and it looks first like I'm being told about how to play the game, but then it becomes so much else and I see things I didn't see before. I feel like reading made me crazy sometimes, other times I feel like it opened my eyes.

That's a ""very real life"" concept trying to understand whtat' s behind politician and media. Kinda cool in that way.  Just a personal point of view ofc."
chiliadmystery,376x8k,HakatoX,1 point,Mon May 25 12:06:17 2015 UTC,"That is basically how I feel about it, too many connections that can't be coincidences, and need to understand the game before I can begin to get it all the way. The game kinda gives a safe place to think about stuff lol."
chiliadmystery,374gz6,Aliasnode,10,Sun May 24 20:08:35 2015 UTC,"So crazy you say that today because last night I started a new playthrough and I'm like 8% in now and just repo'd jimmy's car. I have auto-save disabled and am quicksaving between drives + before missions in case it's not one I am ready to do yet (I'm doing as much as I can before moving on each time).  Anyhow, he commented my hair was the same, and I went and loaded my game back, cut franks hair, saw a stripper, used the car wash, modded his buffalo, and went back to the mission. He didn't mention my hair that time or I already forgot if he did, but it is cool how they react based on whether you listened to them or not - to me, it's a big part of this."
chiliadmystery,374gz6,musicvidiot,4,Sun May 24 20:25:56 2015 UTC,"Interesting. If indeed little comments can add up, then perhaps by him not commenting as you might have seen it means you're on the right track. Maybe his negative comment by not getting a haircut was a warning to go back and do it again.   Honestly my observation it seems a bit too nit-picky for this mystery but at this point we need to be really observant to anything and everything."
chiliadmystery,374gz6,mrzombiejackass,2,Sun May 24 21:28:14 2015 UTC,"I think the nit-picky is good, too. At this point, we're going to really need to go into the abstract and open to up to ideas we haven't seen before I think. The way you put it does sound plausible. It also makes me wonder if we can make michael talk positively after end game, where he really got his second chance. I thought it'll matter most after Amanda txts him at the end and asks him to ""think"" and ""stop doing what he's doing"" and stuff, symbolizing the time for a second chance to change his ways. But this makes it seem like there's stuff all throughout the game. Is a haircut significant? Not so much, but the way we change dialogues this way as you point out, maybe it does."

Not really the same but thought id share. Kifflom
chiliadmystery,374gz6,Knowbob,2,Sun May 24 21:49:29 2015 UTC,"Yea, this is like a progression from how if you failed in IV or SA, they'd have totally different conversations. In this one, they seem to have used it more creatively - to comment on your failure, and return to the normal script, to comment on your hair or not, etc. Pretty wild, wondering how many other places this can be seen."

chiliadmystery,374gz6,xReelGamingx,3,Mon May 25 01:36:18 2015 UTC,"This is well known. If you cut Franks hair Lamar will say... least you got rid of that raggedy-asss hairstyle, I was about to have to drop yo ass (or something similar).   What I find even more interesting is WHERE you can get his hair cut and how this may be more important...  If we think like Frank then I believe he would be more inclined to visit one of the upper class hairdressers in the Vinewood area, he mentions to Lamar that he wants to go legit, so I figure I will find him a legit haircut. If we go to the hairdressers/barbers closest to his safehouse he can only choose from the cliche haircuts.   The first time I tried this I figured I would go to the closest upper class hairdresser to Franks house, the one near Vangelico. I was surprised to see the very first hairstyle you can choose here is the exact one that matches Franks hair on the character switch wheel. This is one of the many reasons I believe we should be doing a playthru to not only act as our characters would or should act, but to help them better themselves."
chiliadmystery,374gz6,DrazV2,5,Sun May 24 23:00:39 2015 UTC,"I really don't feel that Rockstar would require an easter egg to be unlocked only by means of playing the story mode ""correctly"".

By 1994 they had a working prototype, which they named ""RB 2000 Rocket Belt"". The ""RB 2000"" essentially reimplemented Wendell Moore's design using light alloys (titanium, aluminium) and composite materials. It featured increased fuel stock and increased power, and the maximum duration of flight was increased to 30 seconds. It was flown on 12 June 1995 by Bill Suitor.

Something very interesting, I just hit the building with 5 RPG blasts and while everyone ran away I am not getting any stars. M is wearing Epsilon robes.  EDIT #3 - I went around the Observatory to check things out and besides the David Richards Knows sign showing up in the black light of the Space Docker (driving it everywhere for another hunt) I found three destroyable security cameras.

chiliadmystery,36z7p9,Shaggyv108,2,Sat May 23 15:52:29 2015 UTC,I can definitely see Rockstar making part of the mystery as hints towards future DLC. But I have a hard time accepting that the ENTIRE MYSTERY is just hints towards DLC.

chiliadmystery,36z7p9,PandaLovingLion,5,Mon May 25 05:09:20 2015 UTC,"Hope not. Otherwise its 2 years wasted and Rockstar are a bunch of cunts. Why not made the mural with dlc if that's the case. Add the mural and clues WITH the dlc that ends the mystery. IMHO everything solvable should be solvable in vanilla GTAV, perhaps requiring a connection to RS servers though. I'd say just vanilla gtav but so many people have internet that its pretty much default/accepted that a connection at least is expected. So GTAV no updates, connection to servers, should be solvable. Or yeah they'll add it as dlc and nobody will ever trust any mystery they ever add into a game on the off chance it's 2-years-later dlc again"

Everything has been assumptions with the information provided. There's an old saying about assumptions too. Personally, I'm with the group that believes the mural is just a nod to finding the ufo's after 100%. How else would they be found, dumb luck?   I mean think about it(and I'm sure this has been said before) Top of the mural= Go to Chiliad find a UFO, Bottom left UFO = Go to Little UFO on the car at the Hippy Camp, find a UFO directly above it. Jetpack= Go to Zancudo(you found the jetpack at a military base in SA) and find a UFO The cracked egg = an Easter egg and everything linking together. The Five X's = the 5 requirements for 100%, Missions, Hobbies & Past Times, Strangers & Freaks, Random Events, and finally Miscellaneous.   There's more of a chance that's true. Than the mural being a super secret elaborate puzzle unlocking the jet pack. Occam's Razor, the simplest answer is most often correct."

So, IMHO, there is no way that they would put a very cryptic mural in the game that just happens to have a stick man with a jetpack in it.

The mural may not mean jack shit as it is now, but this DLC has been in the oven for so long that there's been ample opportunity to baste it with some sauce based on what hunters have been talking about for the last 18 months.   GTAV is a lot like MGS4. Neither is particularly great satire of any real-world shit, but they're both absolutely great satire of their respective fan bases. GTAV isn't poking fun at society so much as poking fun at us. There's a telepathic dog for fucks sake.  I can easily see them putting some stuff into the DLC based on what hunters have spent the last year and a half talking about. We're the ones who take this game the most seriously, despite the fact that the game is taking the piss out of the player base in damn near every way. So how could we be certain what was and wasn't part of the original plan? Would you pass on the opportunity to tease the player base's craziest crazies? We're the lowest of the low hanging fruit.  So fuck it, you're either into that or you're not. Personally, if we were only ever being fucked with, I think it would fit in perfectly with the rest of the game. Rockstar presented their hairy buttcheeks to people, and sold more copies of the game than almost any other game in history. It's the most brilliant piss-take of fans since Scream."

It's always been 'A - mystery solvable in game' or 'B - mystery solvable by means of DLC'  An A- is better than a B-, but unfortunately the B- seems to be the case. Sad. Maybe next time round they'll get the mystery shit right."
chiliadmystery,36z7p9,AbsolutAlbert17,-3,Sat May 23 12:03:21 2015 UTC,i agree but  A for 2 years !! no clue no answer no nothing !! pc version came out and we rape the game files with no clue !!  after all this hard work and discoveries we didnt even trigger at least something !! to tell us that we are on the track !!  what's making me think that it's will be solvable by the dlc  is the ''JETPACK'' script added in the update patch with no files !! no textures !! just scripts    i think they made it that way because they wanted they're game to be fresh like they did with the next-gen version  and the pc version releasing it after a long time and the heists-dlc  they could release last-gen and next-gen and the heist-dlc all at once !!   that's what i see !!  i don't think a GTA or any game mystery would take 2 years without even triggering something

chiliadmystery,36z7p9,GiantSquidd,3,Sat May 23 14:52:20 2015 UTC,please do so.. if you still want to that is.  one thing that will always slow us down here in this Sub is the segregation between those looking for the Jetpack and those looking for the Truth.
chiliadmystery,36z7p9,gtamike,2,Sat May 23 15:02:48 2015 UTC,"With all due respect I don't think that really matters... We're looking for the truth about the mural which may very well be a jetpack.   Honestly, the reason I haven't given up and accepted the mural being a hint that there's ufos has mainly to do with the jetpack guy on the mural. I don't believe it means ""go to Zancudo"" and I don't think it's intended to represent Trevor. Couple that with the egg on the mural and the egg in the files and I believe there's still some truth/egg/jetpack for us to find.   You may not share my opinion exactly, but we're still looking for the same solution to the mural, and it's not like someone looking for a jetpack will just keep it to themselves if they find something else, hell people still post about ""finding"" glyphs and mundane things we've known since day one, they'll share significant discoveries too if anything is found."
chiliadmystery,36z7p9,ManiaFarm,2,Sat May 23 15:17:54 2015 UTC,"i agree with is, its my bad, its hard for me to explain things sometimes.  what im trying to say is this.  everyone has been staring at the Mural at the top of Mount Chiliad for the last 2+ years and most are still ONLY looking for a jetpack. some people cant think of anything else past the image of a jetpack. im not trying to sound rude, its just the difference of generations (i myself have playd GTA since the first, but most have not) and the difference of education levels purly based on GTA.  R* and there mystery telling go way back.  what im trying to say is that all that effort eveyone has made towards the Mural must be doubled when looking at the entire in-Game World everything it is and everything it once was. all its content and its true meaning and refrance, all the way to the physical content some of us own. e.g. the standard map that comes with the game. the blueprint map from the collectors edition. some people have Epsilon gifts straight from R*.  what im trying to say is that R* spent 5+ years extending there mystery and adding a lot to it with GTA V. they didnt just make one Mural as a mystery, they made everyhing they own and create apart of the mystry.  everyone in this sub should know by now that R* have some wierd looking personal wallpapers on there site. but most dont realise how much they represent they way R* themselves think.  yes there might be a jetpack, but there soooo much that come before that... if that."

'come back when your stroy is complete'  everything else has been there since day1 and telling you what you need to know. it is naturally blended in the Game World you just need to SEE it.

chiliadmystery,370dd2,serovajoe,1 point,Sat May 23 18:32:51 2015 UTC,"The wet spot is a joke by developers.   The platform is suspended metal plate and has been made to look as if numerous people have stood there contemplating the mural. Over time the metal has sagged from the weight and water has accumulated in the divot.  In real life this happens quite frequently and is being emulated in game.  The only approximation I can come up with for the rough strip opposite of the mural is a former sign that was epoxied to the wall and has since been chipped off. Perhaps a sign that said ""Welcome to Mount Chiliad"".  Kifflom!"

chiliadmystery,36x2ip,myinnertrevor,2,Tue May 26 01:12:04 2015 UTC,"Nice post, you always have an excellent eye for allusions and references. I was checking out the Lombank tower a few days ago, but I missed this signet.  I'm interested in buildings with these types of crests/signets, especially when they have a Latin phrase included. There's a spoopy, Epsilon-related church where you pick up one of the tracts. It has one of these, but the Latin used is a common phrase about keeping faith (can't remember exactly how it goes).   This one in comparison is interesting because it ISN'T a common Latin phrase, a google search yielded no solid results. So Rockstar made this phrase up to suit their purposes, whether that purpose is to describe the bank, or something more, I just don't know. There are a few possible ways to interpret the phrase: ""Money, Greed, and Wealth"" is one possible interpretation, which makes sense since it's a bank and all. It could also mean ""A journey for the desire/accumulation of wealth"", or ""A road pertaining to the desire of wealth"", or ""A road pertaining to the desire for a prize"". We desire a ""prize"", and we are looking for the ""road"" that will lead us there, so I think this phrase is pretty interesting, especially since R* paired it with the image of a rooster.   Kerouac connections are definitely there, but I'm not sure how significant they are. I'll wait to hear what you think when you finish ""Dharma Bums"" though, maybe you'll find something interesting.   ""Bloody Canyon"" back cover says that it takes place in the ""Red Hills"", wasn't there a region with a similar name in GTA:SA? Red County or something like that?"
chiliadmystery,36x2ip,EnergyTurtle23,0,Tue May 26 03:38:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks turtle. In regards to viaticus, if  rock star wanted to just say money greed and wealth, they probably would have used one of the more common Latin words for money. I think ""a journey with a prize"" is what they wanted us to get out of it.  Idk about the red county thing, but I'll look into it."

chiliadmystery,36x7aq,Sauceboss5,5,Fri May 22 21:27:58 2015 UTC,"Just going through these real quick:   Isn't it true that any three points on a plane can be intersected by a complete circle, since any three points can intersect an arc, and the circle being a simple extension of that arc? If so, any known points that intersect that circle could arbitrarily fit after the fact.  This may be the result of confirmation bias, as the results seem to have been replicated in non-puzzle locations. This is an easily debunked now that we have access to the scripts, we can look and determine precisely how the game decides to relocate a character and after what duration of time. Alternatively, there should be a script that manages a character's movement when we are not directly controlling that character and they are not in the presence of another. Seems to be debunked within its own thread as night bird song ambient sounds. This one deserves merit as it includes an observable change from the norm. If other radio towers exclude the platform, it means that this one is special somehow and requires it. It's easily checked by observing the other towers in the game. This one also deserves merit as it exhibits an observable change, which would mean that its deliberately coded into the game."
chiliadmystery,36x7aq,TheBitingCat,0,Sat May 23 02:09:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with all your points, however, the link between the UFO's and the observatory goes deeper than just coincidence.  It is true that any three points can be intersected by a circle, but if you look further into it you will see that if you connect the points the distance between the Chiliad UFO and the Zancudo UFO is equal to the distance between the Hippy Camp UFO and the Observatory.  Not only that, but the lines are parallel.  The chances of this happening accidentally are very very slim.  Of course, many deliberate choices in this game's design may be unrelated to our ""Mystery""."

Now I'm not sure how the what exactly the Owls signified in the show (I've only just started watching it a few days ago actually) and if they mainly show at important moments in the ahow or something like that. But mabey rockstar are using the hoots as both an allusion to twin peaks and to signify something in the game...as I say I'm not really sure about this, as it would be weird to use a reference to something that not everyone may have seen as a marker.

chiliadmystery,36vc73,iplay4us,1 point,Fri May 22 12:29:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think they took inspiration from 3301, mostly because there were plenty of ARGs of this type before anyone heard of Cicada 3301. It's more likely that they took inspiration from the Halo 3 easter egg and the Saints Row 2 easter egg (where you had to follow a trail of hidden arrows to find a giant hidden easter bunny). SR2 was the most popular title in the series, it made a lot of waves when it was released and it was definitely on R*s radar.   I personally believe that the ""Chiliad Mystery"" is as old as GTAV itself, and may have been a key aspect of the game's design. We see some of the Chiliad-associated symbols first being used in GTAIV: Episodes from Liberty City, which was released in 2009. When they released Epsiodes, they replaced ""The Journey"" radio station with ""Self-Actualization FM"", a station reportedly operated by the Children of the Mountain. Have a look at their logo:    Self-Actualization FM    We have a man doing yoga, encased within an egg shape. The ""egg"" is the pupil of the All Seeing Eye, which is imposed directly over the shape of a pyramid (mountain) in the background. We are led to believe that Self-Actualization FM and the CotM has no relation to the Epsilon Program; Brother Adrian insists that the two organizations are separate. So why, then, is the Epsilon program advertising CotM's radio station in GTAV?:  Epsilon and Self-Actualization FM"

This is not meant to be rude or to be dismissive, but I really doubt that after multiple years of game development (this is Rockstar no less, it took them almost two years to get Heists ready...) that they threw in this huge mystery that took tons of secret coding and fancy hiding... while they were busy doing final testing and making sure the game actually functioned properly before release?  I mean, I'm just saying, game development takes a loooooooooong time, especially for Rockstar.  GTA IV came out in April 2008.  They were already starting on development of V once IV was out the door.  Over five years later and the game was finally released.  Do you really think when they were nearing the end of the wire to make this game functional that they decided to throw a monkey wrench into the works by adding this ""mystery?""  I don't.  That's just personal opinion but I don't see any programmer, and let's be fucking real here, let alone MANAGEMENT (who want one thing only: $$$$) are going to decide to take inspiration from such a thing at the last minute and try to cram it in, especially if it doesn't mean they can't sell you a DLC or money for GTA:O.  On top of all this, they would have had to have been in the know about this shit the day it came out on January 5th 2012 for there to be any conceivable time frame for them to get it into the game before final testing.  They literally would have the inspirado hit them that day and the decision was made that day.  A year later, you're really pushing the limit of them being capable of doing it that close to release."

I always saw the mural as a map of what to do after you ""opened"" up the mountain or did the right things.   The glyphs appear to tell you what to do after 100% and how to make the event on the mural happen.   Go to top of Mountain (path to top where mural is) While it is raining During a Crescent Moon ( I think it may have to be this moon phase, not just 3:00 am, but maybe it was meant to show nighttime only) The ""Eye"" alone (This is not the same UFO as the bottom of the mural it is drawn differently) So it could represent doing something, or drawing attention to an action or object at this time, or viewing something since it is referenced as an eye. Obscured Glyph - Looks like the ""Eye"" is half there (possibly wrecked, also it is on it's side or vertical?)   The Mural  If you take it a face value it looks like a map on how to navigate once in the mountain to get to the bottom 3 ""rewards"". The X's would represent rooms you probably can't escape and die in (so avoid them). I don't think it means the 5 glyphs on the outside at all (but if it did, maybe these need to be erased or blown up, but then why have them connected with lines and not just on the map). That is what I see when I look at the mural. There ""appear"" to be 3 entrances one on the top and two on each side. So I think the key is finding these entrances. The lightning around the mountain could be the reference to rain, but maybe it has to actually be lightning not just raining.  One last thought - The glyphs on the mountain all have 3 lines above the eye. The mural has 7 lines around the eye. No idea what it means, but it is probably important.  Nothing ground breaking here, I just think back to basics is the best way to solve this thing."

Do you see how thinking you're right doesn't make you right? Because if you make me model this entire thing, you're asking too much.  And for good measure, no, this is not at all how that shape was made. the topology is hand made on the sign, this is so generous and don't dare say that a sphere can make that shape when I show you right here what shape comes from a sphere. You need TOO MANY TRIANGLES AT THE POLE to match the sign:  http://i.gyazo.com/d28988449cf1460b4f76c833fc6b5b79.png  Do you see how all the way to the edge there are no extra bends in the outer ring? The extra bends in the outer ring of the sign is proof it was extruded from the outline. Subsequent extrusions are even, which is typical of the exact workflow I have explained like 5 times now.  It's hand made. Even my example is nowhere near the precision of the hand-made rockstar one and the pole needs EVEN MORE geometry and that's why he added those extra triangles. The thing was made extruding a polygon outline of the texture inward and capping it where verts begin to touch with triangles. Deal with it."

chiliadmystery,36re01,BigLBx,-4,Sat May 23 19:35:20 2015 UTC,Wrong sphere construction.  You are using square polys.  The model is constructed using triangular polys which are asymmetrical because they run in one direction.   Do you see how fucking different that is from the sign?

They would still be symetrical in the longitude and latitude. The sphere is the same kind of sphere. It just has lines drawn through the center of each quad on yours.

Ofc all meshes are triangles on the GPU, for fact quads were only implemented on sega saturn and some specific nvidia or  voodoo gfx card from the days... it was in both cases a terrible idea, it had poor performance in 3D, it looked bad, it made people stop sleeping to debug shadows, lights, texturing... From a ""performance"" point of view, quads use different algebraic systems to render, if a quad model and a triangle one are made with the same ""computational"" power consumption, the triangle one would have a better look for rendering curves and round objects, so if you made them exactly similar, the triangle model would have better performance (even if it's barely noticeable) Linking some links of interest : http://www.quora.com/Why-does-graphics-hardware-only-render-triangles http://gameangst.com/?p=9    ps: remember they dev'd the game for xbox360/ps3 in mind, they had a performance cap"

You're wrong, and what you called wrong, was actually right, despite your stupid unrelated link. Saturn did render quads. But that is also one of the reasons why it failed.

It does not come from a simple sphere... The sphere is not in the sign... only on the bottom... the top's poly flow does not support any primitive and came from hand capping tris to where the corners of quads were meeting while extruding inward the mass from the outline.

In these screenshots it looks as if there were faces welded directly to the surface of the oil drop. But I don't mind being honest when I say I don't know why Open IV is displaying those particular faces as purple without the texture. How does Open IV handle scene lighting?

chiliadmystery,36re01,theseleadsalts,2,Fri May 22 01:40:13 2015 UTC,"Could it be that the faces are just inverted, which is causing them to appear differently in OpenIV than the rest of them? I used to work in an old modeling program called Milkshape, and when creating polygons manually from individual vertices sometimes they would be inverted like that and show up as black in the preview window while all the non-inverted ones would be white."

Inverted face normals could definitely do it, though I would think it would be more obvious with the texture on in the lit engine. But hey, you might be the one who got to the heart of this! That theory/observation I can believe, much more than ""computer created this, LOOK AT THE GEOMETRY!!!!!"" ;)  EDIT: Want to add: the only odd thing is that inverted face normals generally aren't rendered (or rendered as transparent if you want to look at it that way). It's why no-clipping under the world looks the way it does--the geometry seldom has a backface. However, that doesn't change this from being a good explanation that I'm willing to accept."
chiliadmystery,36re01,DreamingDjinn,3,Sat May 23 03:36:13 2015 UTC,"It does seem to be that they are inverted, when the texture is not on and you zoom in passed the surface, the whole interior is purple like it appears from the outside.

I still think it's a neat logo though.  Or wait...it just came to me. Perhaps the R* artist who made this prop knew this, and designed the object--inverted normal faces and all--to create this specific effect/logo? It's a stretch, but this is R* we're talking about. The cream of the crop. It's not like it's that hard to select these faces, say ""Hmm that would make an interesting logo"" and invert it--knowing how the engine would render the model in the way that it's crafted."
chiliadmystery,36re01,SynthesisP,3,Sat May 23 02:23:32 2015 UTC,"I concur.  My theory is that what ever they use to render uses the inverted color for the interior of the object (perhaps as a way to visually verify anomalies etc) because that blue is a good match for the color inversion of the orange sign and only shows when the interior is lit by the internal light at night, emissive perhaps?  I wish I knew more about visual studio so I could put this model into one of the spawners and spawn it all over in different lighting situations, but oh well."
chiliadmystery,36re01,OptimusGrimes,1 point,Sat May 23 02:49:42 2015 UTC,"Well it's just odd, because other objects don't really have an interior color like the blue one this exhibits. You'd think that any time someone clips through something, you'd see a blue interior (were that the case). Usually things just go completely invisible, and they don't concern themselves with ""filling"" an object's interior in this way. In this case you would usually see darkness, or at the very most the sign behind the drop. But then again I'm just going by what I can see looking at videos and noclips, I don't actually know how the RAGE engine renders the stuff.   It's different from how a normal modeling program would display the model though. Not so much that it can't read the files and display them properly, of course. The blue color is still a mystery, but it's not one that really concerns me. Back to the real hunt!"

They cast the texture, in iron or some other metal, as if the drop was a plane?  Like a flying vehicle?  And that created a drop shaped pelt?  Like an animal skin?  Makes sense   You literally posted a picture of the model with a blue outline and said ""DEBUNKED.""    You literally just stated the obvious   When in fact, you have no idea what constitutes a visual glitch and what constitutes regular easy texture mapping.   I have every idea what a visual glitch is.  However there is no such thing as ""regular easy texture mapping"" and also texture mapping has nothing to do with this.   Hell, I could recreate it in 5 minutes in UE, and I'm not even that good.   The question is not whether it could be recreated.  It is whether it was intentional.  It was not intentional.   That doesn't make this anything more than a cool looking illuminated sign though, but it's REALLY far off to write this off as a visual glitch for little to no reason other than the fact that you looked at how the tris are arranged.   No, it's perfectly on point.  The shape is created by these polygons, pure and simple.  It cannot have been pre-planned, as these polygons were not edited, they were generated."

I was being sarcastic, because neither of these terms apply to a 3D mesh created by triangular polygons.  We are not talking about a flat planar surface or an unwrapped texture or anything like this.  The shape is created by the existence of these polygons in the 3D mesh.   I really don't see how this can be produced by accident.   I don't see how it CAN'T be an accident.  Are you saying they knew the 3D modelling program would create this exact pattern of polygons when they created the oil drop?  And they used that pattern to their advantage to create this symbol intentionally?   If it were an accident, it wouldn't only be at night.   Not necessarily true.  The night-time lighting system turns on, revealing this glitch because of a divide by 0 error or something similar to do with the exact angle of the light which is turned on for the night-time lighting system.  The sun light is not able to produce this glitch because it's too diffuse.  Whatever light is cast by the night-time lighting system is specifically made to light this sign up at night, and it's what is casting this shadow.   It might have something wrong with the model, but I can't understand what you're pointing out with the image. Is there a comment in here that explains it?   There is nothing wrong with the model, it is a perfect mesh of an oil droplet.  But that mesh contains the recipe for this shape which we see created by the lighting glitch.  The reason the blue parts are highlighted is because those are the parts which create the divide by 0 error, or whatever is happening to make those polys render incorrectly."

Whatever they did, be it some flipped normals on a light overlay that only shows at night overtop (like window lights) or it simply clips there, and being a clone of the same shape, it's easy to happen. It needs to be looked at closer. Ask openIV people to give some info on what that model contains and how it achieves emissive qualities at night - ie, is it an overlay like other lit up windows? Is it night vertex colors which they still use for some things? Is it texture controlled with an emmissive channel in the shader? Is it the same geometry using some other type of hack? We don't know until we look closer.  What you have found is the mesh structure, we don't know why it was mapped in the way it was (matching your outline). Polygon edges = natural uv seams with which we can use to switch which materials are where - my advice is, check into the materials of the model and find out what controls its light (is it extra geo time of day spawn, or is it material/shader based on a single mesh? that would be my first place to look if I was looking at files)"

There is a light which lights up the entire sign, along with every other sign in the game at night. I already know you are about to go look for a physical light and you won't find one.  They placed free floating point/ambient lights near every sign which turn on at night, and they are invisible.  If you have ever worked with 3D you know that light sources are invisible unless you specify otherwise.

What I'm arguing is that the symbol is not a simple ""graphical glitch"" as it's something that's very obvious and is seen frequently by many different players passing by the sign at night, as opposed to something like the rotating FIB logo on the UFO (which less than 10% of players are going to notice, and 10% is being very generous).  There's nothing blue around the symbol, nothing that would be intersecting and causing this graphical issue. Why is it so hard to believe that it's actually a symbol designed by someone who was making a sign for a gas station? It's much more realistic to write it off as such than to claim to know the internal modeling and prop design that went into the game. The polygons/tris are smooth, and there's nothing that would cause the lighting of the engine (again, how all this is displayed/lit/triggered is controlled by RAGE) to graphically glitch in this way, especially considering how consistent the symbol is across every angle/system/quality. It really isn't that hard to take a planar map of the teardrop--ha ha ho ho your joke earlier had me in stitches--output the UV space to an image file, Screen layer it over the basic texture they were creating for the teardrop, then color in the displayed tris until they had an interesting logo.

chiliadmystery,36o3fm,Huge_Dabs,1 point,Thu May 21 03:03:17 2015 UTC,I think all it does is show that Ursula has something to do with the easter egg not the location. Most likely how the weather changes.

chiliadmystery,36o3fm,mickeyboicky,1 point,Thu May 21 12:44:11 2015 UTC,"Besides the Tractor in the bush there is also a Surfer Van parked in the driveway at times. Same type of van you see at the hippy camp and similar to the Van Truth had in San Andreas which he called ""The Mothership"".   Also this is really obscure and probably an unrelated fact but Geraldine Moffat (Sam and Dan Housers Mom) was on an episode of a show called ""UFO"" where the plot included having to kill an alien that had taken the form of a cat. Some of Ursulas dialogue includes comments about killing cats.   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0735633/  I myself ended up at the lighthouse organically by following what I thought were clues. Starting from the radio telescope with the FIB agents and guys in lab coats, their name tags say they are from some University, so I went to the only University I knew of in the game, ULSA. There's an emblem on the floor there which sort of looks like a bird above a lighthouse. It also has some Latin writing on it but it didn't make much sense to me, something along the lines of ""The clown helmet is reborn ad nauseum"" or something like that. Anyway yeah.....Kifflom."

chiliadmystery,36o3fm,Dadalot,0,Thu May 21 12:39:07 2015 UTC,"I've figured out the ""A to Z and back again"". It's in Micheal's house, on his book shelf. There's an A and a Z next to each other, holding books. The ""A"" has a book with grafitti all over it, and several other books. The ""Z"" has books about knowledge and money. Its the search. We see the clues, such as graffiti, the mural, so that's A. But we have to use knowledge and reasoning to decipher these clues. That's Z. Now, we go back and forth between the two (A to Z and back again), decoding the mystery. I should probably make a video on this to make more sense, although it fits perfectly. Especially since Michael is the Epsilon member. Plus, the tract is a guide for easter egg hunters, for us, it's not for the Epsilon members in the game"

chiliadmystery,36lwnr,HakatoX,5,Wed May 20 11:00:09 2015 UTC,"I think they are aware that Tesla would have brought our society to type I (from type 0). By cutting our dependence on fossil fuels and bringing the energy of the earth to our doorstep, not only would he have made our society a space-worthy society, we would have moved beyond currency and money, because all energy would be free, and you would then only need knowledge and materials to create and do anything you want.  It would have revolutionized the world and changed our society completely.  Rockstar's theme of this game is our society's slavery to currency.  We kill for it, we die for it, and we do other unspeakable things for it.  Tesla would have been the savior of mankind, but mankind was not ready to give up his dollars, and killed Tesla and his invention.  Who knows if that was for our own good because we really were not ready yet, and it would have killed us as a race, or Tesla was stopped in order to ensure our enslavement.  But the man himself was on the level of Prometheus. Some think he was Prometheus, in human form. No one else is worthy of being mentioned in the cosmic perspective that Rockstar creates their games from.  Either the aliens are orchestrating it all, and the stories of the creation and slavery of the human race by aliens in the ancient past are true, OR they are trying to liberate us from our own ignorance, and elevate us to their level, or at least to a level where they don't feel threatened to reveal themselves to us.  I for one don't think we will ever reach the level of a race that has millions of years of evolution more than us.  It's like thinking you will eventually be older than your dad."

But worldwide power transmisssion was too close to the perfect technology, with Tesla's genius eventually people would be able to pull the power from the magnetic field of the earth.

This one is in the middle of the street and there are several more around it. The ammunation nearby can only account for 4 of these, maximum, leaving 2-3 which are unknown  Those are the 2 I currently have which are unexplained by anyone  There are definitely more, I will be releasing an updated map sometime soon with removed markers for things which are 100% known and checked like shops, gates, etc  We are also missing some doors, as someone pointed out we are missing the LSIA southern building door, and as I found at Kortz with the unlock glitch (there was an extra door which was different from all the rest and was not on this list)"

chiliadmystery,36kgnd,crustpunker,10,Wed May 20 01:18:01 2015 UTC,"There's always been people ripping the code apart, though. It's probably a lot easier to do so now, but there were a lot more people doing it back in the first 6 months or so. Not a ton has changed. For all the concern over the mystery being solved in the files like as soon as it was released on PC, it's been more than a month and no one is flying around on a jetpack.   The release of DLC really isn't an ""at least"" kind of situation, I think it's the most we can look forward to. It might even solve something, which would be bittersweet in my opinion, but it'd be something. I think the ""at least"" part is that, at the very least, it'll revitalize the hell out of the whole thing in a way nothing else has. I know it's what I'm waiting for, and with the game having sold more than 50 million copies, who knows how many people will get pulled either back into it, or into it for the first time.  If what you want is just to have the mystery on terms you find agreeable, that's totally fair enough. But -- and I mean no offense to the people digging through the files at all -- I haven't seen anything that makes me believe any real answers are going to get mined up. More curiosities, sure. But not answers."
chiliadmystery,36kgnd,RdEydFcd,1 point,Wed May 20 04:46:09 2015 UTC,I am starting to think somebody may mod a jetpack into the game before we find anything substantial to tell us what we are looking for in our hunt.

None of the next-gen updates added content which can be described like that.  Also, I happen to know that several of the next-gen content updates were things which were originally cut from the initial release of the game.  The Dukes car and Dodo sea plane were always in the game code, but they had removed them for some reason, probably time constraints or marketing reasons (take out a few items from initial release, then package them into the next release to make it seem bigger)"

If they were to set a deadline, then they would have to crunch for time again and wouldn't be able to fit in every single idea they want to.  I want them to polish the hell out of this DLC and make the conclusion of our mystery fantastic beyond any other video game mystery.  And then I want them to spend time adding in every little idea they have had over the past 2 years.  Even if it takes another year, they can only release this DLC once.  I would rather it come later and be better than come sooner and be lighter on content."
chiliadmystery,36kgnd,trainwreck42o,1 point,Wed May 20 15:26:56 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not against R* creating new contents for a DLC, what bother me is the mystery we're looking for should already be in the game if it were cut from in the first place. It's been since 2013 since people are investigating the ""chilliad mystery"", jetpacks / driveable ufos are speculations only. Every owner of the game deserves that ""MC mystery thang"" to be solvable for free. They've being dev'ing GTAV since 2008, if the whole mystery thang is about what we've came so far, they knew how it should end up (even if they couldn't finish in time) So they either thought of a dlc for an inexistant game they were creating, or the mystery is already planned on papers and thus we deserve to get our hands on it for free. I won't mind a simple chilliad mystery solution AND a dlc with a real well-made story and mystery and... new contents... If we ""made"" so much progress and mostly thought of everything, don't you think they won't be able to fit the elements with a mind-blowing story ? I'm pretty sure the dlc would come out, 24 hours later everyone would be talking about the mystery / solution / what comes in.. On the last end, a free update to solve the chilliad mystery would bring a lot of people back on GTA:O, new customers and so on... then BAM! big fat bawlzy dlc, more leverage, so guud, much wow. I guess time will tell <3"
chiliadmystery,36kgnd,sympit,3,Wed May 20 16:12:46 2015 UTC,"Check your expectations.  You already solved the mystery by revealing the UFO.  The jetpack and UFO icon are teasers for the DLC.  It's our fault we decided there must be a further mystery to solve beyond the mystery which already was solved when the UFO appeared at 3AM/raining on Mt. Chiliad.  Rockstar is guilty of refusing to respond to queries about this matter, but omission of the truth is not technically lying.  We don't deserve anything.  I will pay for a DLC if I think it's worth all the extra gameplay from more missions and things to do.  If I don't think it's worth it, I will wait until it comes down in price 80% like all DLCs do."
chiliadmystery,36kgnd,trainwreck42o,0,Wed May 20 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"Yup, expectations are really high (420blazit) and R* might not be answering anything related to what already has been found because it's in fact the WHOLE mystery. I'm fine with that, really, we had fun trying things, speculating on lil bits of nothing... But I feel cheated by the fact they've ""mixed"" both mysteries, why would they put the jetpack (and UFOs) ON the mural if they were to be added later ? Why would they cut the mystery content if they haven't removed the mural alltogether ? Teasing gamers with incomplete mystery just to sell it as a dlc seems ""meh"", even EA changed their minds and added free pools in TS4 LEL. EA! It just feels incomplete, the mural is useless for solving anything... The MC cabletop is already a POI, no matter how hard we tried the mural doesn't overlay nor show anything... except an egg and a jetpack, the egg can be found in the models... It might be a cut content but why would it still be in the files ? They've removed everything that was wierd-looking / misleading, jetpack variables from some patches, even if they were (or could've been) for the dev function (func_jetpack like in III/VC), what about the meteorite ? Wierdly R* doesn't communicate about anything related to the mystery but almost every leaks were pretty accurate AND buzzy, jetpack in the source code were around April 2014... a dude played Heists before everyone else last january... I'm pretty sure some leaks were intentional regarding R* delays... This keeps adding a ""nope this can't be"" flag in my thoughts, R* announced a solo DLC in early 2014... It's been almost a year and half, GTA V took 5 years, Implying they had to cut contents, so they already have almost everything to work with : mystery clues, contents, storyline, an already working game engine, map, models. Would it take that much time to create something they could've been working since old gen release ? Even if it were a small part of their employees... Let's turn the catch line : check your expectations, why would they release a solo DLC with jetpacks or UFOs ? If what's already in the game is what the jetpack dlc is based on, it'll barely be ""bigger"" than the heist update (and it was free!) On a marketing side, offering a free solution to the Chilliad mystery (if it's indeed a jetpack) would bring more people back to GTA V & GTA:O, so you can reach right after a ""jetpack update"" more gamers with a brand new dlc that extends the storyline."

I am feeling that this will be an expansion pack sized DLC, like Ballad of Gay Tony - And it will require you to purchase it as a separate game.  So you will not transfer % progress from your previous game save.  It may have rewards for returning players however, and maybe even rewards for 100%ers (I think this is the best way for them to release a special bonus for hunters)"

chiliadmystery,36lvhd,v_Buurnz,3,Wed May 20 10:09:01 2015 UTC,IRL the building Arcadia is based on had four towers surrounding the main part but rockstar made it three in this game. IMO this is much more indicative of sacred geometry than that asymmetrical fountain at maze bank.
chiliadmystery,36lvhd,GiantSquidd,3,Wed May 20 17:04:14 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that there are three fountains all within three blocks of each other is significant.  Arcadia logo is obviously Zancudo UFO shaped, Maze bank fountain = egg, and the Eagle on top of the World @ FIB/IAA courtyard = jetpack  (because you would feel like an eagle on top of the world with a jetpack).  All three boxes on our mural could correspond to these three fountains in downtown LS."
chiliadmystery,36lvhd,trainwreck42o,2,Wed May 20 18:18:26 2015 UTC,"Could they? ...Sure. Personally I think you're reaching with the eagle/jetpack connection, and I've never felt the fountain was as compelling as everyone else seems to, not to mention that the Arcadia logo/Zancudo ufo looks nothing like the one in the mural.  I'll probably still look around there some more, maybe the line connecting the jetpack guy and the ufo are indicating underground tunnels under the egg, which could roughly correspond with the tunnels in the area...?

chiliadmystery,36lvhd,HelloCringle,1 point,Thu May 21 01:16:47 2015 UTC,not to mention that the Arcadia logo/Zancudo ufo looks nothing like the one in the mural  maybe the line connecting the jetpack guy and the ufo are indicating underground tunnels under the egg   This kind of thinking assumes that the symbols on the mural MUST depict real life objects.  The symbols could be metaphorical or referential in nature.  For example maybe it implies there is a connection between the FIB/IAA and Arcadia business center.  Perhaps Arcadia Business center is where Don Percival conducts his business.
chiliadmystery,36lvhd,trainwreck42o,1 point,Wed May 20 18:36:23 2015 UTC,"Oh they could definitely be metaphorical, and I think it's very likely Don Percival would likely have an office at Arcadia, and that the agencies are connected to the high finance people of los Santos. I think the two latter points may be irrelevant though, it seems obvious that there would be behind the scenes dealings between said parties, but I can't think of what we can actually do with this information... I'm open to your interpretation though, I'm just neutral and skeptical by nature.  Assuming this interpretation is legit, do you have any ideas on whet to go from here?"

I was spitballing, and didn't even need to label it as such for you to understand.  I too am neutral, including on theories I put forward myself, until they are proven with more hard evidence.  Assuming this interpretation is legit, what we can do with this information is know what's next:  If Don Percival is likely the creator/owner of the Zancudo UFO, it makes sense that he wanted the same design for the Arcadia business center logo and fountain pieces.  And it would explain why neither Don Percival nor a flyable UFO are in the game, yet, because he and the UFO will be part of a DLC.  If the IAA are in possession of the jetpack, it would explain why the IAA have not played as prominent a role as the FIB, yet, because they and the jetpack will both be expanded upon in a DLC.   And if we assume the egg symbolizes Maze Bank: the funds which are used to create the FIB UFO could be held at Maze Bank, and the story behind the creation of this FIB branded UFO, and also the Maze Bank building itself, will be part of the DLC story.  I know it's a cop out to say DLC instead of further unlockables in this mystery, but overwhelming evidence points to non-existance of the jetpack and flyable UFO vehicles.  We have found only snippets like gadget_jetpack which are only present in the recent director mode files."

chiliadmystery,36lvhd,GiantSquidd,0,Wed May 20 20:00:41 2015 UTC,"I think the only shitty thing Rockstar has done is decide not to respond to support requests regarding ""is there anything more to find"".

They told a great story and created a great mystery, maybe too great, in that people wanted it to keep going, and didn't want it to ever end.  The rest of the cockteasing we have done to ourselves, in absence of further light from the original storytellers"
chiliadmystery,36lvhd,trainwreck42o,1 point,Wed May 20 20:09:58 2015 UTC,"To me it's more resembled the rough layout of the prison then the military saucer, however in saying that the due to it's slightly off shape (the prison layout is like a deflated version of the logo) I will concede that there is a chance it isn't referencing that.  As for the eagle on top of the world, since you looking to read deeper into it, I personally felt it to be pointing to Merryweather (their logo is an eagles head. I've always felt the logo's for the companies and organizations reveal a lot about their purpose/place in the GTA world) and their 'control' or claws sunk into Los Santos and the globe (their website also has a map detailing all the countries they are active in)."
chiliadmystery,36hj3h,Tlamimilolpa,14,Tue May 19 12:58:36 2015 UTC,I think it's the London Underground myself.  In all seriousness though there's probably a thousand different things that look like the symbol. It's very basic. It's a circle with a line through it.  The question you need to ask is; does it instinctively look like a black hole when not directly comparing it to this image? To which I say I don't personally think it does.
chiliadmystery,36hj3h,WarBob,7,Tue May 19 18:17:48 2015 UTC,Possibly... This mystery has felt somewhat like a black hole for awhile now.

But then you have to ask 2 questions.   1 - How would a black hole relate to the rest of the mural? 2 - Would we be able to create/find a black hole in the game?  Not trying to be snide towards your efforts, just making a point, and it's out of the box thinking like this that could reveal an answer. I came up with some theory's of other things that the pictures in the 3 boxes could be. And those were questions I tried to ask myself throughout."

Lacey gets into your car, and has other functions besides standing there spouting lines.  The light blue color denotes they are only slightly interesting to the player. The more noticable the color, the more noticable the designers wanted to make the character.  So bright flashing red/blue dots are highly interactable, whereas these light dots are marginally interactable, and the medium dots are people like wallet thief victims etc  The light blue blips all have the exact same function, they randomly say lines from their list of lines, after checking the character who the player is using, and loading the proper list for that character.

(http://screens.nicnl.com/16fa5126a4ffa8dcbb035611aa72a0dae3/maze_bank_fountain_crack.jpg) As the Epsilon Tract says: ""Only the apple tree and the peach tree speak.

(lake of knowledge?) is showing us something. (the tree?) The fountain itself have the crack and the shape of the egg of life. (the egg?)

chiliadmystery,36exm2,Nicnl,2,Tue May 19 07:20:56 2015 UTC,"This is some other Epsilon Tracts parts that seems to be somewhat related:   ""The lake in which truth lives is very clean and clear"" => The water of the maze bank fountain? ""A mirror in a lake where truth lives."" => Same ""the peach tree that flows upwards"" => The scrolling thing in the water? ""Hold on to the peach tree and the apple tree and give all that you have in faith and watch fruits flow upward to a bountiful harvest."" => Same ""The peach tree talks and the apple tree talks, you hear them and you know."" => Is there another similar fountain? ""Peaches are in fact apples"", ""The apple tree and peach tree lie together in the same orchard"" => Maybe not? ""Indeed, there is a lake where truth lives and in this lake an egg"" => The ""egg crack"" in the fountain is under the water."

chiliadmystery,36gags,trainwreck42o,3,Tue May 19 03:59:34 2015 UTC,"In the case of the movie premiere mission, that movie premiere happens at a specific time of day, so it makes sense that it has to warp forward until the movie is about to start.  And if it happens for that mission, we can assume that the events of all the other missions are meant to happen at certain times of day, for purposes of realism.  For example, if you were to play the mission where you go on a bike ride with Jimmy at Vespucci beach, it would be really weird to do that mission at 3AM.  Logically, Jimmy would be sleeping.  Similarly, some of the night stealth missions require cover of darkness for the right effect. It would feel silly to have Ron creeping around the back of the airstrip in broad daylight.  And the part where you have to shoot out the lights so he wasnt seen would not work, because the sun cannot be shot out.  They would have to rewrite the mission for daytime and nighttime.  So, it's not just aesthetic.  It's function is to help with suspension of disbelief.  You would feel you were playing a video game if you were to do a ""daytime"" mission at nighttime or vice versa."

chiliadmystery,36gags,bluntsarebest,1 point,Wed May 20 04:36:36 2015 UTC,"Yea, it was a thing throughout the series but I didn't even notice it was a thing until I realized that they did this now with the automatic time. There are still missions you need to wait in V though, like the Lawyer had to be on a certain day and time in IV among some other ""can only trigger between x and x oclock"" missions. There were a few points in all the games that the story could not progress unless you went to a marker at a certain time of day. Basically where  you see ""come back as trev/mike/frank to begin"" in the past would be ""come back at time of day"" or ""day of week"". It was used a lot in SA and IV, well, about as much as we see the time automatically catch up to the desired time and weather in V."
chiliadmystery,36gags,Vurtne26,2,Wed May 20 05:06:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah some missions only started at certain times in IV, that's right.  But it never had the timewarp forward.

I arrived within seconds of the Chiliad UFO showing up, and it scared the crap out of me because I hadn't landed yet, and BOOM it was practically in my face.

Epsilon started in GTA IV which would be the 4th paradigm where things really took off for the company then came 5 games that never talked about epsilon (im not sure could be wrong) which in any order are the lost and damned, the Ballard of gay Tony, San Andreas, and vice city or chinatown.

TakeTwo has put out a press release reaffirming that Rockstar has previously announced story mode DLC, which would seem to indicate that they ARE still planning on releasing more content. From gamespot.com:   ""Strauss misspoke during today's call, as over a year ago Rockstar Games had said that they were exploring story mode content for Grand Theft Auto V; however, no further information has been released since. As always, we leave it to Rockstar Games to share information about their games when they're ready.""   Edit: rephrased to make it clear that the statements are from Take Two and not Rockstar.

That being said, Rockstar has been very secretive about they're future content for this game. They haven't even said more than a few words about the next multiplayer update.

They will tell you the service is currently unavailable, and the reason is because its meant for another game mode, but they won't tell you that.  They will say something that sounds more realistic.

I called him enough to know the only time you can hear the ""if you have been trusted with the premium number, you can call that now"" is right before the final mission. I guess I could possibly be wrong, maybe it plays every time his bubble is there, but I don't think so. :o Anyone can call the ""non-contacts"" version sure, but when it's not dialed and it's played when I call his contact card only then, it leads to wonder if there is a special number."

There is no special number, the same number gives different results depending on the character calling and the time/place in the storyline.  Some contacts have multiple numbers, but I think Dr. F has only the one.  It could play only before that final mission.  But that would just mean that Dr. F cut off Michael from his private line before that final mission for some reason, that's all.  And seeing as Dr. F is planning on dropping Michael as a client, it makes sense.  Try calling Brucie's number in story mode, or Pegasus in story mode, or any other numbers listed in the wiki entry for the contact phone numbers...  Try them with different characters at different times, and you will see there are voicemails that were created specifically for the ""wrong caller"" or ""this is a bad time"""

I fully understand how the game works.  The reason it changes at this point is because there are no more chances for Michael to have a phone session with Dr. F.  Up until this point, he has been able to have a phone session with Dr. F on his premium line.  But now, when this mission marker appears, it shows that Dr. F is no longer available for phone sessions (and never will be again) and you must go in to speak with him if you want to progress in the Dr. F sidequest.   And if you don't go get the bad news and have to chase him, then what?   Then Dr. F will always be waiting in his office for Michael to show up.  Simple as that.  The game isn't scripted for Dr. F to have a waiting period where he goes away if you wait too long   or, if you do right, and get the private line before then, does the chase even ever get a chance to occur?   Michael talks to Dr. F on his premium line all the time, that is how he does the therapy over the phone and then it subtracts from his bank account when the call ends.   His calls don't get blocked.   They don't get blocked, but Dr. F removes Michael from his list of approved callers prior to this mission, which is why he now gets the same message that Trevor or Franklin or online character gets.   ""If you've been TRUSTED WITH the PREMIUM LINE"" is unique to calling him before that last mission afai can tell it seems   No, it's not.  Calling his number manually as Franklin, Trevor, or online character will give the same message because they are not approved contacts in Dr. F's phone.   no one has been trusted with a special line, else we would have heard about it. Bad choices in accept/reject?    Michael uses the premium line all game long.  He loses access to it when Dr. F decides to drop him as a client.  It's really simple."

If it is impossible, the only explanation I can give for you karma players is that this mission is actually restoring your karma. You are rescuing the man that you had to aimlessly torture because some douche told you to. So to get your karma restored, you have to torture (in this case, kill) the people that ""tricked you"" into torturing that poor man."

chiliadmystery,36blvb,iamdroppy,2,Mon May 18 22:32:06 2015 UTC,When I saw the dead security booth guy outside the North Yankton Heist. He was shot in the back of the head. You obviously start the game with a dead innocent. That screwed it for me.

chiliadmystery,36blvb,toeknee1,1 point,Wed May 20 09:33:09 2015 UTC,"My take on the whole karma thing, is to stay true to who each of our protag is. And this is just the way I see it, and the way Ive done a karma type playthrough.  Frank, hes a gangsta, reading his LI wall, and listening to conversations between him and Tonya, Denise, Lamar, etc. Hes killed before we take control of him, and doesn't really have remorse for it.   Mikey, theres things that Amanda says, and also things that he says to Dr F, to Jimmy, to Tracey, about hows hes killed before, doesn't seem to stressed by it either.  And Trevor, when we meet T in the Mr Phillips mission, hes clearly a man that a lot of people are very scared of, including one time big bad ass Johnny K from the Lost MC. He even has the members of the Lost MC running away from him. So hes clearly not worried about killing people.  I think we put too much emphasis on being the best person we can be with the 3 protags, no killing, etc. But I think if we just stay true to who these guys are, its the key.  The key to what?? No idea. But, this playthrough, which is nearly 100%, is the only time in the 8 or so times Ive played through the game, that Ive seen a white Buzzard for T(just bought a Buzzard off the website to do the ""Fly under the bridges"", and it turned up white). Also the only time Ive seen Amanda wearing a black bikini out by the pool, or drunk and nearly passed out on the lounge with a wine glass in her hand, and a wine bottle laying on the floor.  I have no idea if anyone else has seen these things, probably, but I haven't until this karma based playthrough. I do have pics of the white buzzard, and pics of Amanda to prove that Im not bullshitting."
chiliadmystery,36blvb,ManiaFarm,1 point,Fri May 22 02:20:09 2015 UTC,So how did you play T?  Do you think you did anything different with him that might have triggered the white buzzard this playthrough?
chiliadmystery,36blvb,rsears14,1 point,Fri May 22 02:45:51 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why the buzzard is white, possibly just a glitch.  During the playthrough, I just tried to stay true to who the 3 were before we take control of them. With F, I stayed loyal to his real friends(Tonya, Lamar). With M, I did whatever I could to help out his family, and with T, I stayed on the path he was on when we met him in Sandy Shores(disposing of The Lost MC, and trying to build up his company).  I returned all the stolen money/wallets/etc, didn't kill any pedestrians, tried not to have any bad car accidents which could result in death to npcs, I didn't spend money on clothes/haircuts/tattoos/cars/car mods/weapons unless a mission required it, didn't kill anybody unless a mission required it, I called everyone on the contacts list often, did lots of hangouts, checked LI and Bleeter often to keep up to date with whats going on.  That's pretty much it. Im now at 92% or there abouts, have some Epsilom missions left, and those damn knife flights to get to 100%.  I would've thought that some people on here would've seen these things before."

This was the same situation for a lot of the Epsilon video footage.  edit: Also, it can easily be an old photo so maybe the trees blew over in a storm or were cut down?

Also I was paying attention to big substations and any key locations in the surrounding area. It's exhaustive but I think our next best bet would be to map out the power lines and major substations, along with the small 1.23 gw huts. There has to be lightning bolts on that Mural for something and considering how symbolic the Mural is, it tells me power. The Maze Bank building is on Power Street."

You will get a chance to see if you missed any hints the first time through and maybe do some different choices. There are so many ways to setup heists alone it's worth multiple playthroughs imo. I wouldn't use anyone else's save, cause I think Social Club knows and I think it's not solvable unless you play right, so, if that person didn't solve it, their save isn't right if that karma theory is true. Can't be ruled out and has more evidence than anything else, so I don't use save file anymore. Almost at my first 100% now."

Btw, once you get to a hundred percent, I believe to trigger the big foot mission, you have to wear the 100% shirt as Franklin."

A long time ago I had a made 100% file on ps4 but couldn't get the epsilon missions and rockstar told me to do some kind of loading thing that didn't work. So I started a new one and got to about 96% or so, went back to my !00% percent for some reason and the epsilon mission was there.  I think you basically just have to play around with saving another separate game and then reload the screwy one, I'm not entirely sure of the specifics, but it has something to do with switching between save games."

chiliadmystery,367u1w,DopeBoy187,6,Sun May 17 01:45:41 2015 UTC,Well for starters theres this text from devin weston after he shows up to the premier and tells him his wife and daughter couldnt make it. You have 2 mins to sacrifice yourself for your family. If you dont make it to the house you fail. But what if you can sacrifice yourself somewhere before timers up? If you go to the house there is a shootout and when you go outside its thunderstorming even though when you walked in the house 30sec ago tt was clear not a cloud in the sky.

chiliadmystery,363r0t,Atari1337,1 point,Sat May 16 01:25:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah that makes sense.  Like the metadata which is released for car mods, before the 3D models of the cars are released, which allows people to show the mods over an invisible car and project what it might look like"

chiliadmystery,363r0t,acuratech31,1 point,Sat May 16 15:11:41 2015 UTC,"Not that i have personally seen, but i'm sure other games must have this. Its the only sure fire way of keeping things secret. I would guess they would stream it in as you uncover more of the mystery. So, for example, if we get to step 3 of 5 it starts downloading, then once we get to 5 of 5 its awaiting us. Would also allow for cutscenes to be called in.  Don't forget, all our data gets saved to Social Club. So its not too far fetched to think that Social Club tells our console/game when its allowed to request the prizes. Im a web programmer, so a lot different to games, but its what i would do...  Some people feel that it wouldn't be fair on none connected users, but my argument to that is; Rockstar have zero problem in releasing a broken game, and patching it via the internet after release. If they can live with people being stuck with a broken game, then they wont think twice about not giving them a prize to a very hard puzzle. And they probably have a paragraph of 'some features require an online connection', deep in the small print, so would be covered in any kind of crazy law suit, eg: people would try and state they are missing a game feature they paid for. etc etc"

The mystery could have gave us the old school basic jet-pack style from CJ/Truth. then a future DLC could have given us a more modern version and tied in the FIB etc.

It's just kind of messed up everything from SA we hunted was basically thrown at our feet.   The one thing we want from SA seems to be non existent. Not to even mention the Egg.   Why did they give us everything we hunted for in SA but in V we're hunting obsessively for a Jetpack? Where is it? Why make a hunt for it when in reality it's nonexistent?  Right now this Jetpack hunt is looking like the Bigfoot hunt, we believe it's there and will hunt until 9 years from now when guys 6 or 7 is released a Rockstar rep will say ""hey there was no jetpack""  Idk I really hope I'm wrong but regardless at this present moment we have things from SA we thought to be myth and now the one thing we physically had from SA is just a myth in V."

They would have been wrapping this one up then, not adding new unrelated ones like they did. That said, I am sorry to say it, but I am seriously starting to lean toward the side that the mystery is supposed to teach something, rather than reward something. It's the ""clue"" glyphs and the mural that keep me hoping someone discovers something we have never seen (potentially that we didn't even expect), but at the same time, it could just be pointing to the ufo events the whole time."

Btw not tryin to bash you, i also believed at some point that there is much more to all the Illuminati symbolism and stuff, but as someone who has played and finished every single Gta game I always kept in my mind that R* was ALWAYS making fun of everything. Dickjokes here, illuminati there, FIB written on the UFO´s because some stoners irl believe in all this stuff. Im NOT saying that the conspiracy theorys IRL are not true  , at some point it would be stupid to not believe in UFO´s  :P    If actually all this stuff is saying ANYTHING serious about the real world then it would fit more to those theorys that the goverment is trying to make us believe that there are UFO´s and aliens for whatever reasons, i dont want to go too deep with this but there are some really intresting theorys out there that there is just NOTHING after life, that we are here to complete a circle of something , this also covers up some theorys about the Universe not beeing infinite, but read on that for yourself if you want :P"

Maybe he's the owner of the casino?  This bit is taken from the gta wiki. ""At the very end of the game, Carl is a young and wealthy man. His assets and business interests include the Grove Street Families gang and Madd Dogg's contract in Los Santos, a car garage and several other properties in San Fierro, and shares in the Four Dragons casino in Las Venturas, as well as the government's $60 million jetpack.""  So it's possible that his business ventured out and he holds stakes or owns various casinos through out the GTA Universe. I have heard that the games don't take place in the same universe. However this is R* we're talking about. This is their game and they could do w/e they wanted."

Why allow people to be led on by this if it was going to be unceremoniously discovered to be a DLC?    so that you can stop playing their game keeping it relevant, instead of playing a game that is now over 2 years old looking for stuff? why would they want to do that?  and spitballing here again: perhaps there was no dlc planned, ever, but they saw the volcanic eruption in response to the mural, and decided to add some of the stuff people were going batshit about.  i feel like it's a little weird to be upset at a company that designed a beautiful, awesome game with an enigmatic mystery embedded in it that isn't even part of them game, because they a. didn't give you enough hints to solve it along the way, or b. it doesn't lead to what you want it to. especially if c. they even put the thing you want into the game later via dl-ing it."

chiliadmystery,3653yh,Solidgear4,2,Sat May 16 09:45:38 2015 UTC,"I think they will never do such an interview. I can't remember doing such an interview back in the day on GTA SA with the crazy bigfoot hunt, correct me if I'm wrong.  It would kill the buzz entirely around the whole mystery. The feeling that not all is discovered keeps a huge amount of people playing and just having fun while searching.  We all do it for certain goals, but travelling to those goals is a hell of a lot fun for me, even if they will never be found or disclosed they were in the game from day 1.  Full disclosure from R* will also make it very hard for a future GTA to include another big mystery, as they revealed how they did it in V, so we will not be as enthusiastic as we were all along playing V.  I love playing V, and although not always searching; just knowing there are still a lot of undiscovered eggs while playing makes it more fun.  If mural puzzle truly cannot be solved at this point, and they want to give the jetpack or flyable UFO to us: Best they sneak it in the game without us noticing or being able to find out about it.   Some guy said maybe certain files are only created by the engine at certain triggers in-game.   That would be best option from day 1."

You're right about the UFO's, I'd like to see a little more about them. What's the deal with the 2 different UFO types? One looks like a 'flying saucer' straight out of a 50's B movie but it says FIB on it (strangely, on next-gen versions the FIB marking is bugged, means that maybe they altered some aspect or another related to it), and the other looks like a modern technology type one and has a message on it written in english.

(unless they put it in after the fact and reverse engineer it to have a connection to the mural... which would honestly be kind of cool imo)   I'm dead serious when I say that I recently finally got 100% in the game and I'm too scared to see it.

I've had two different types: quiet and brief coughing by passing pedestrians, and slightly longer coughing (say two seconds) that fades in and out from passing cars. the latter was very persistent and noticeable everywhere I went. I assumed it was something like a karma sign."
chiliadmystery,362kks,ManiaFarm,4,Fri May 15 17:22:55 2015 UTC,"Why did you assume coughing is a karma sign?  This must be the first time I've ever heard this concept of coughing being a sign of karma.  I have to say it ranks low as a possibility, because pedestrians do all sorts of human things like coughing, such as scratching their heads, eating, drinking, taking a phone call, making a phone call, texting, smoking, dancing, etc...  I don't understand how coughing could be interpreted as karmic, rather than just a human thing for pedestrians to do.  They can't all be on a cellphone at once, that would be weird.  There are other actions like coughing they can do while you view them, to make these 3D models appear human."

chiliadmystery,362kks,crustpunker,2,Fri May 15 18:59:27 2015 UTC,"the report is randomized to a degree for example  if you don't help your family in the side mission you may get one of these:  Must try to teach that there are other living creatures on the planet! Not good at giving time to others. Lazy and self absorbed, but needy. Lazy and solipsistic - then again, family is awful. Really not capable of giving to others. Ignores family life. Ignores people closest to him. Avoids family commitments. Will probably get left by family. Not a good care giver. Incapable of seeing needs of others. Complains nobody cares, then avoids family like plague!    if you do help your family in the side mission you may get one of these:  Family minded.  Decent member of family - unfortunately, family is awful! Loves family - having met them, not sure quite why. Loyal to crazy family, which I suppose is a start. Cares about family - so not totally solipsistic. Cares about family, despite their obvious problems. Co dependent. Family minded for some reason. Spends time with family - and manages not to kill them - maybe a possible sign of progress? Wants to be good family member. Very dependent on family for self-worth, which is odd. Family focused - not sure why."

chiliadmystery,362kks,ManiaFarm,0,Fri May 15 20:28:50 2015 UTC,"Every time you complete the third way and it loads the psych report, it is affected by the random number generators which load phrases 1-13.  There are many phrases which say similar things in different ways, so that you can usually never get the exact same report twice.  This is another reason why the Psych report cannot mean anything: it's silly to expect a random number generator to work in your favor to solve a mystery"

chiliadmystery,362kks,ManiaFarm,-1,Fri May 15 20:34:28 2015 UTC,"wow   What is so surprising?   read my response above, I clearly explain how you get different phrases with the same meaning.

If you help your family it will say so, if you don't it will also say so, there is nothing random about that.   OK, so now it's not random?

That is where it is randomly deciding on the phrase to use.  Let me clarify because you will undoubtedly assume I am saying it randomly chooses between yes and no, and latch onto that as your next argument.  It chooses yes or no first, then random chooses a yes phrase from the list of yes phrases, or a no phrase from the list of no phrases.   It seems that you are biased in your investigation. Such a sad thing to see new users being mislead.   There is no bias in my investigation.  Can I ask why you are prejudiced in favor of Karma being real, despite the overwhelming lack of evidence towards this?  The definition of bias is ""prejudice in favor of or against one thing.""  Can I ask why you have a bias, and are unwilling to accept new information in the form of this post?   Such a sad thing to see new users being mislead.

He seemed to speak a different language each mission or something. I swore it was french, then I thought it was russian - I don't know, he may not be speaking either and speaking just one language I don't identify, but that was hilarious that he'd be a minute man. This playthrough, I stole the tractor to chase tractor-e-tractor instead of just use trev's car, and ended up foot chasing him so far because he bailed from his before he even got out of the field and I bailed from mine way too far back lol. Finally got him, though. I shot them up, I think I should have tased them to get gold, I can't understand the requirements for that one and didn't look it up."

For 1 their posts are very very well constructed and set up in a way to help you but still confuse you. They release little bits of info so you can stop looking one way cause its not the way and start looking in another but still are unable to find anything. Then they dont post or comment on anything for a long time and when shit gets ridiculous or ""dies"" sure enough theres another post lol ive always thought this. And it makes sense too. If you created a mystery as big as this one. Would you not join the hunt to follow everyone? To keep the mystery alive?"

That way they would know what worked really well at hiding certain content, and what was a very bad method at hiding things in the game. And this would mean they would be keeping tabs on the GTA community to see what we have uncovered over all this time  edit: To answer your question, I doubt they would misinform us. That doesn't seem like Rockstar. Maybe there are even R* employees in our midst who have no idea if there is more or not and are hunting for the truth just as we are."

I found this out about a year ago on ps3 by accident running away from the shootout.When I returned with another delivery the scene triggered again. After that the doors were open then would shut . After another delivery the doors would remain open. think the max I did was seven deliveries in total,got the same cut scene each time from the fourth delivery. Also on my first play through I cleared the camp but they respawned, so it has had problems, but after several updates this did not happen again on other play throughs but the door ""glitch"" still remained. currently on ps4 and do not own the game but still follow progress here. Although I believe this could just be a glitch I always felt like more was going on at the camp and certain people deserved to be delivered over others.Good luck hunting !"

And speaking of parodies, i wonder if this is mostly all one big troll by rockstar. Litter little bits of 'evidence' and 'hints' around that require, lets be frank, some pretty serious mental gymnastics to make anything of, and now you have people coming up with all kinds of theories, conspiracies, conclusions and ideas based on very little.  BAM, you've just made a few thousand versions of this guy.  It would mesh perfectly with Rockstar's humour."
chiliadmystery,361dur,EntireCityOfCompton,6,Fri May 15 08:08:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah i've thought this. I think their whole idea was to make this GTA a 'Jesus toast' making the mural out of a few common/reccuring shapes throughout the game.  Also a few missions lead me to believe this. The Epsilon mission is about how we are sucked into these sort of cults and give everything to them to get nothing in return.. (We only get a robe)  Another is the radioactive parts where all you get is $10 another pointless task showing how the bigger tasks are normally the ones what don't pay as well.  Also the mural not the chiliad one but the city one, says ""for when the great scorer, comes to write against your name, he marks not that you won, but how you played the game"" this is obviously talking about the last evaluation you get at the very end showing your traits.  Also I have heard some radio talks which mention similar things about how everything can not be worth the effort or how we get sucked into things to easily.   I think the whole game is playing on 'red triangles'/ 'jesus toast'  But I think I love the game more for it. Also by doing so they will keep a fan base going for ages. People love mysteries and treasure hunts.  But all that being said there has been some very strange easter eggs in games which weren't found for up to 15 years (Donkey Kong)"

You have not really presented any backing to your ""thoughts"" to convince anyone that all there is to the mural is just the UFO at the top of the mountain, which is why I'm not going to waste too much of my time trying to explain otherwise.    In essence, everyone in this sub ""seems to be searching for more"" that isn't there.  So everything else on the mural means nothing at all? Just the lightning bolts and the mountain and the UFO, thats it, the rest are red herrings that are all completely irrelevant.   Also the comments about the lightning bolts and storm makes me think you aren't even aware of the conditional glyphs around the mountain that actually point to the spawn conditions of the UFO.  If you truly look at that mural and thats the best conclusion you could offer, I think you are very much in the wrong place and probably shouldn't waste people's time, with a misleading topic title and very little content in the post that offers anything to the community.

chiliadmystery,361dur,Weejul,2,Fri May 15 08:39:44 2015 UTC,"Everything I wrote is speculation and has no facts to back it up. It was my take on the clues in the game, nothing more. I haven't heard of the glyphs pointing to the UFO, but I don't think they would be necessary as there is a line of text that  says ""Come back to this spot when you complete the game"" in a slightly more cryptic way. There may be more to the glyphs/UFO drawings, but I personally think they might just be details in the game rather than important clues to a grand mystery considering the same symbols are written all over the UFO enthusiast homes and vehicles. This post was speculation and thoughts like many others on this sub, I'm sorry you feel it was low quality."
chiliadmystery,361dur,Weejul,3,Fri May 15 09:22:29 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that we all have to speculate about the meaning of the mural, I'm not asking for facts, I'm was just asking for why you came to the conclusion you did.  Only a small part of the mural relates to the top UFO, if this was all it had to reveal I do not think the rest would even exist on it.  What would be the purpose of it? To hint at DLC which they plan to release maybe 4 years later?(mural in the game from day 1)  To wind people up with the prospect of rewards they cant achieve? It doesn't make any sense.  You don't bite the hand that feeds you in the same way I don't believe that Rockstar would tie in so many things to come up empty at the end. I feel like the post is low quality because you've put a theory out there without even knowing all of what I would call are the basics about the Chiliad Mystery. In reference to glyphs: ""I don't think they would be necessary as there is a line of text that says ""Come back to this spot when you complete the game"" in a slightly more cryptic way""  Then the eye: ""There is no eye, the symbol on the top of the mural is the UFO you summon after reaching 100% completion""  The point of re-quoting this is to demonstrate clearly the lack of knowledge because knowing the glyphs you would know that 3 of the 5 found on the mountain point to global conditions that when met with 100% completion cause the UFO to spawn.  The 2 remaining glyphs have unknown meanings but all 5 glyphs refer to the Eye/UFO which we can almost conclusively say are the same.  This means that the mural isn't relating to the spawning of the UFO - its giving you directions on what to do after you have spawned the UFO.  Just no one has worked out what to do.  This is what we should be focusing on rather than dismissing the whole thing because nothings been solved yet."

But I can't help but feel the sentence ""come back when your story is complete"" is too loose. By the time people get 100% that's that an they usually don't pursue anything else after finding the ufo and 100% statistically.  Whilst I can agree that there can be a lot of jesus toast involved in these theories/hypotheses I also feel that there are a lot of unexplored avenues.   Happy hunting."

chiliadmystery,35zv81,TMBSTruth,2,Fri May 15 12:56:11 2015 UTC,"i'll try and explain my observations: Usually the water in GTA V has little imperfections, small waves. The mazebank 'drums' are different in this respect, their surface is almost perfectly smooth. ALMOST, because it looks like they have another 'layer' of water on top, in a certain pattern, which moves ever ~20 seconds. If we observe this from a certain angle, we catch the reflection of the bank which makes the mentioned 'weird' watersurface very clear. i've  tried to mark what i'm talking about here, but it isn't as clear as in game. inside the red 'angle' i drew, you can see the water is a bit 'off', i suggest anyone who doubts this just go take a look at the fountain in game, at night. seeing the movement close up yourself really clears up what i'm talking about, since it's so subtle it's hard to catch in screenshots/clips.

I think this could be purposely put there. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting
chiliadmystery,35zv81,PandaLovingLion,2,Thu May 28 00:09:28 2015 UTC,"Z-fighting:       Z-fighting is a phenomenon in 3D rendering that occurs when two or more primitives have similar values in the z-buffer. It is particularly prevalent with coplanar polygons, where two faces occupy essentially the same space, with neither in front. Affected pixels are rendered with fragments from one polygon or the other arbitrarily, in a manner determined by the precision of the z-buffer. It can also vary as the scene or camera is changed, causing one polygon to ""win"" the z test, then another, and so on. The overall effect is a flickering, noisy rasterization of two polygons which ""fight"" to color the screen pixels. This problem is usually caused by limited sub-pixel precision and floating point and fixed point round-off errors.

Because of this interest I very early on tried to fly to the sun. If I remember correctly, it appeared to just keep moving further away when I would start to get ""close.""

Do the red towers line up with the x on the mural?   Maybe we need to trigger the eye in each spot, the last being on top of Chiliad, where there's another tower!   I have to work or I would test this myself.   Edit. I don't think the altruist camp factors in... I know yoga is near the red tower on Gordo And we all wondered why it was there... They are leading us near the towers"

That path doesn't zig-zag at all like the glyph. Example  Just tested, and as I expected, the sand glyph points directly to where the sun sets. And many have recognized in the past the arrow-like symbol in it is a laguz symbol, meaning ""water""... Really interesting. Where is the duplicate on the mountain? Gotta check that out now."

chiliadmystery,360go5,Nfear,2,Fri May 15 20:35:54 2015 UTC,Yep
chiliadmystery,360go5,utotesmad,-1,Fri May 15 20:59:06 2015 UTC,"you both are derps.  everything related to pd1 was found in the files, no obfuscation present at all. 2nd has had everything exposed, from subtitle text to mission triggers to old maps. the reason it hasnt been solved yet is because theres no full anything to solve yet.  You can see bit by bit pieces they are slipping in each patch related to counterfeit and old maps being remade for example. the whole tldr bs doesnt make sense as the files are already there."

chiliadmystery,360go5,acuratech31,2,Sat May 16 01:42:06 2015 UTC,"No they found hashes that do not have models, currently it is looming like there is no jetpack, we will know more soon"
chiliadmystery,360go5,long-shots,1 point,Sat May 16 03:09:13 2015 UTC,"How do we know they don't have a model?  'scuse me please i'm just wondering.  Like could the ""hash"" not be linked to an obscured model somewhere hidden within another file, by another name?  Or would it really be more obvious to find?"
chiliadmystery,360go5,acuratech31,1 point,Sat May 16 03:21:15 2015 UTC,Well there are other things missing it currently looks like its a weapon and more specifically a gadget much like the parachute is. But no models are found not even for the little weapon choice wheel when you choose a weapon.   Its a new discovery let the pros sort it out I know about 35% of what the people who discovered it.  The model could be hidden on a server and it all starts to download in the background adding the missing pieces.  Or DLC/ Cut material.   I lean toward DLC right now.   But seriously who knows. They may have made it to hard to solve not enough clear clues in such a large world. Or they did exactly what they wanted and created a mystery to keep up people playing there game while they ready PC version and future DLC.

chiliadmystery,35xq0o,Flashypony,2,Thu May 14 13:37:20 2015 UTC,It will still exist but do nothing. So running it with out internet will do nothing just collect and not send logs. As soon as you're back online it will send as soon as you startup.
chiliadmystery,35xq0o,Crazer94,1 point,Thu May 14 19:45:58 2015 UTC,Fair point. I hadn't considered that
chiliadmystery,35xq0o,Flashypony,2,Fri May 15 03:38:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah sorry phone died after post but it is easy to check for just run GTA V with installed mod, run the mod and check for file running in background. There quite a few no clip mods so just check yours."

Delete that as well.  Through windows Registry Editor (Win+R -> regedit), check the following key:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon  Under the ""Shell"" Key, if it says anything other that ""explorer.exe"" change the key to ""explorer.exe""  Hope that helps."

I don't think that there is more behind it cause the whole mystery is a pretty common mystery.. i mean, aliens, aztec/inca/egyptian stuff..

I tried to bring wade because he said ""I know exactly where to take you, wade"".  I also noticed on a side note that only SOME passengers complain about going to altruists being the ""wrong way"" - some there is no dialogue, but others ""Oh no, I know exactly where you need to go"" - I think it's a hint, if he doesn't confirm he's supposed to take them there while approaching the camp, then turn around and don't drop them at the camp?"

I have a own 75% and 65% save and use a shared 100 but want my own so I know for sure how it is played. Really fun trying to finish missions different ways. Like, I blew up the motorcycle before the cops came in casing the peleto this time (65% save) and trevor didn't exit the vehicle. I found that cops are fail state still if trevor never gets out. Fun messing with the missions like I that. I think maude stopped giving me jobs cause I killed one guy. She gave me one more, and I delivered him, but then no more, and  Ithink there are more than 4."
