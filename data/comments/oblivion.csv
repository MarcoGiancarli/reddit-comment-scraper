oblivion,3e4qnv,devilmachineyea,3,Wed Jul 22 00:18:45 2015 UTC,"Illusion, Restoration, Alteration are good skills to support a conjured minion in battle while keeping your self safe. If your creature is going to be the one dealing damage you can ignore Destruction and go for Blade/Blunt instead, or Marksman if you want to hang back and do damage. You can also take Destruction too and do Creature+Smacking+Destruction for very high DPS.  Sneak+Illusion is a good combo because it lets you cast a 3-5 sec invisibility spell, crouch, and by the time it wears off the enemy will have aggroed onto your summon, and you can get sick sneak damage with either Bows or Melee.  Either Armor should be fine, user preference.  Any magic build should heavily consider the Apprentice or The Mage, though the Warrior, Thief, Steed, and Lady are all balanced birthsigns for any class."

oblivion,3e34m1,Madenmann,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:02:08 2015 UTC,"Systems with which you could run oblivion are rather cheap today. I remember playing it with a radeon9600 card; downloaded low poly grass and switched the flickering of the torches off, game ran fine.   Why don't you go to the mages guild, during the day the magister sits in the Lobby and can tell you about cures for certain things..."
oblivion,3e34m1,TheKing4Real,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah theres this thing you can download called ""oldblivion"" which makes it ultra ultra low requirement. You basically only need a processor of some sort, a graphics card of some sort and it will run. I didnt have the latter when I tried to install it during tough times onto my Compaq Presario laptop (which for some reason had the graphics card taken out when I got it). And on the ps3 version there are some major bugs, nothing too major though, that went unpatched due to bethesda never releasing any for the system. Check out this bug for instance- http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Vampire_Cure#PS3_GotY_Vampirism_Cure_Notes    There was supposedly a workaround where by you changed the system language to german and then borrow the non-goty edition from your friend to swap the disk and then it crashes and then yadda yadda. I tried everything and nothing worked. So I came to the realisation that I would live with it, provided it was constantly at 25% (which is livable, considering the only effects at 25 are positive ones- strength and health boosts) so I never leveled up. Fast forward to a few years later (a few months back) and I decided ""what the hell"" and found a bedroll in a dark cave to sleep in and level up. Dude, I leveled up from like 17-23 in one go and the game got noticeably more difficult. I was walking around like a pimp before with high ass stats due to the game not catching up with me (due to me not leveling)...meh, would do it again..."

oblivion,3e34m1,xXGriffin300Xx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:15:26 2015 UTC,"i mean, if you don't use graphics mods it should be good enough to run it at least on medium settings. But yeah, PC's that can run Oblivion are not expensive."
oblivion,3e34m1,TheKing4Real,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:44:02 2015 UTC,"Hey, if it's pc performance you're worried about there's really no Need. I have an old, rather bad 4gb 2ghz laptop I play Oblivion on, and with all the settings on medium and low poly grass + no flicker lights mod (And the game looks pretty much the same with these settings as it does on ps3/360) I get an average of 30-40 fps in cities and 40-50fps outside, with no stutter and fast loading times.  Perfectly playable."

oblivion,3dz98q,TheKing4Real,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:23:04 2015 UTC,god damn it lol. Yes it's a mod. It makes it so enemies don't level up with you. As well as fixing TONS of problems with the game. What are your PC specs?

oblivion,3dz98q,TheKing4Real,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:25:26 2015 UTC,"No, I dont, but it sounds to me like you said that the game would not level up whilst you level up...? Does it stop completely leveling up or is it slow but still proportional? If so, its still taking a major element of moxy out of the game and thus dumbing it down. Surely if it was about patching bugs you could just patch them individually and not have to download something that ruins the nootsack ambience of the game!"
oblivion,3dz98q,cutdownthere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:29:47 2015 UTC,"It makes it so all enemies have a set level. So at level 1 you could find a level 25 orge if you stumbled into the wrong cave. Or at level 15 you could find a level 5 wolf. Or at level 30 you could find a level 1 rat. So it takes out the leveling with you, but makes it so you can fight any enemie at any level.

oblivion,3dyhw0,iannic-ann-od,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:31:53 2015 UTC,You will have to install the three OBSE .dlls manually into the Oblivion folder.  Other mods can be installed with MO unless the mod specifically says not to install with a manager.

oblivion,3dx6hi,DaenerysTargaryen69,2,Mon Jul 20 11:04:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree. There's no documentation page, the link is a direct download of a zip file.  The zip file when opened is highly disorganized, the top three folders all have the same name, and below that are a dozen plus folders, and a program the name of which produces zero results in search engines. The name of the supposed extender produces only links to THIS THREAD, and a youtube video which has also recently been posted to this sub, and doesn't look like it has anything going on it it which couldn't be attributed to other graphics mods.  No other results at all for the extender by name, the apparent C++ plugin (which has a couple of subfolders from which I got the name ""lightswitchone plugin""), or anything else in the zip file that seemed like it might produce google results. My antivirus programs don't think the zip is suspicious, but that doesn't mean a whole lot.  It has no documentation included in the zip - not even hidden away somewhere, as I searched it rather thoroughly - and it's definitely not something designed in a way that's obvious to mod users. Unless you are a C++ coder you probably couldn't figure out how to use this for its intended purpose. If it even does anything of the sort."

You extract it into the Data folder, and the reason I didn't put a Read Me is cause it's my own personal mod. To be honest I didn't think no one would use it anyway, and I was right, cause people are fucking dumb as hell. Suck my dick, all of you. You know how hard it is being a programmer cause of idiots like you 2 neckbeards?
