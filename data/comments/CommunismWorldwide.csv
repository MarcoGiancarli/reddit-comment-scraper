Especially as they persevere in remaining open (the discussion of going private to reduce harassment has come up many times) and the difficulty in maintaining their community despite the constant attacks from srssucks and other hate subs."
CommunismWorldwide,3ds5im,2DE,-5,Sun Jul 19 11:34:03 2015 UTC,"To provide an alternative view: Censorship of this kinda doesn't make any sense on the reddit platform as of now.  Reddit is a platform that was created to support free speech and expression.  Now it is a platform for propaganda of the ruling classes.  Banning coontown and all other similar subs just leaves....all the defaults and a large number of other extremely popular subs (imgoingtohellforthis, iamsosmart, all the cringe, economics, etc.) who constantly espouse racism as well as pro-fascist pro-capitalism propaganda.   The problem isn't banning subs.  The problem is the entire platform has been bought off, from mods to admins to the core company.   However I'll even go a step further: even if none of what I said above was true, it still wouldn't make sense to ban these subs (outside of a radically different reality existing IRL).  As anyone who's read Hegel or Chomsky, or studied suppression and propaganda knows that's not how you win the information war (at least no where close to entirely).  The key is to control education, and to remove the limits on conversation and thought, in addition to providing endless examples, arguments, and support for the right causes.  The conflict of ideas almost inevitably leads to a massive swing towards the proper causes.  Why do you think in the U.S. conversation is so limited?  They don't ban it, they discourage it view other limiting (for more subtle) means.  Because it is obvious to those in power that if actual narratives were given the floor, they would quickly find themselves OUT of power.   For another example, just look at all the right-wing regimes worldwide who imposed bans on left-wing literature/speech etc. throughout history.  In the majority of cases it doesn't work out for them, for the same reasons.  An outright ban rarely accomplishes the actual aims.     To adopt the antiquated, ineffective, and morally reprehensible totalitarian tactic of blanket censorship is at best foolhardy and very poorly thought out.  It might be appealing in a vindictive and short-sighted way, but it rarely serves to do more than radicalize and increase the appeal (to some) of the opposition movement.  Lets use this coontown thing as an example. Banning them doesn't decrease their hate, it INCREASES it.  It doesn't decrease their dangerous behaviors, it increases them (they now have no voice).  Banning them doesn't discourage their followers it ENCOURAGES them and CONFIRMS their biases.  Banning them doesn't diminish their arguments it INCREASES their power.  There is a far better way to deal with that sub (and pretty much all subs on reddit to an extent).  That is to end their ""safe space"" (aka vapid echo chamber) by disallowing their mods to heavily police the sub and manipulate votes.  Open it up to the rest of us, allow us to present arguments and counter their BS.  That will have exactly the opposite effect of banning them.  It's not easy, and it takes time but it is far more effective.  Not to mention these people are usually a bunch of exploited workers themselves, who have been manipulate by centuries of ruling class propaganda to hate another more exploited group, rather than their masters.  This makes them a prime group to re-educate and turn.  EDIT: downvotes, but no responses, why am I not surprised.....  If you cannot argue your point, why expect anyone else to take it seriously."

The Council Communists were aware that many of their ideas were situation-specific, and without a doubt much of their writings have been passed by through the course of capitalist development. Nevertheless the council form continues to appear in revolutionary situations and the belief that the key to human emancipation is not State or party, but working people themselves is surely still important to the world of today."

CommunismWorldwide,3d9dqr,lovelybone93,13,Tue Jul 14 16:38:29 2015 UTC,"were there extremely long lines to get basic essentials like my US History propaganda classes taught in school?   There were some lines to access products but the truth of those lines escapes most tourists and the bad faith of Western propaganda. They could acquire whatever products they wanted in the state-run stores.  When there were milk products that were imported (things from Finland) or cosmetics from Poland, and Hungary, or clothing and perfume from Czekoslovakia or France, people would ask the last person in the line ""what's this for?""  And they would tell you ""French perfumes!"" And you would immediately get a big line so that you could buy those rare products that only appeared every once in a while.  In our Western imaginations, those lines were bread lines and they meant scarcity and food insecurity. None of that is true. And you can also explain (playfully) that people on the majority, would walk around with big bags and briefcases because to-and-from work they might run across some kind of sale of really good cheeses from Finland or fine leather shoes from Ukraine.  So if you saw a line, you would be quick to go ask what the line was for and then get in line if it interested you. Bottom line... yes there were lines, for luxury goods. Not for necessities. There was no rationing. People had money in their pocket and they wanted to spend it on themselves or a loved-one.   What were things like between different ethnic groups like ethnic Russians, the Slavs, Germans, and other peoples that made up the Soviet Union? Was it more harmonious than the US and their ethnic groups?   In the capital of Moscow it was common to see people from the entire ethnic mosaic of the Soviet Union. And these either students or construction workers. The city was closed to local immigration. They had population control for 10 million people so that it wouldn't get over-crowded.  On the University campus foreigners would comingle and coexist with local Russians and the rest of the Soviet people. Relationships were fraternal and friendly, though there was some friction too. Particularly with Soviet people from Muslim countries, these happened because of ignorance... people didn't know their customs and were curious/afraid/dumb when it came to how they behaved, what they believed, and their practices.  Most of the friction really existed in the Socialist Republics. The Russians who were in the Baltic, the Russians who were in Lithuania, Latvia and so on, these were often in positions of administrative authority, and the locals didn't like that. Today it's on its head, where the native Ukrainians or Lithuanians will persecute descendants of Russians.  The difference of the Soviet period to now is that back then, there was more equality. Your access to the bureaucracy, academia, and so on, was based on merit (or your ability to play the game). Today in places like Moldavia, Belorussia, and such, discriminate and impede the advancements of people belonging to other ethnicities simply for being from other ethnicities.  So yes, Russians back then were sent from Moscow to go and be part of the administrative body of the government of, for example, Ukraine, but the ones calling the shots were still the local politicians and bureaucrats.   Were there still worker's councils (soviets) then?   Of course. Everything was based on the Soviet system. From the bottom to the top, it was very syndicalist and council-based approach. More closed, maybe and more formal than we would like, but there was the Supreme Council and other bodies that received delegates and this from unions and other trade syndicates.   How were LGBT people treated?   I'm sad to say it was repressive. The culture was very closed-minded. If you had a sexual preference that deviated from what was socially acceptable you could lose your job, your standing in academia, your charge in the worker's syndicate. It was a very closed, very conservatively-minded atmosphere.  I didn't live it myself, but they treated homosexuality like a sickness, and you were sent to a hospital. It was no more, or less, than it was treated really in the rest of the world. Remember in Britain there was still forced chemical castration for homosexuals.  Its why I don't feel surprised that today's Russia is so anti-LGBT. They always were. You had to keep your true self secret.   How did you like the Soviet Union compared to where you live today?   I lived in many countries, but I will compare it to the United States. Of us Baby-Boomers, one of the things that was most immediately felt (and missed) is the lack of job security, the lack of home security, the protected childhood and old age, the safety of knowing that you had free education, or the prestige and respect that artists and academics were able to enjoy, and the stability of knowing that you would never be run out of your home, you would always have food on your plate, and you would always be able to find employment.  The common people of the Soviet Union were very friendly, very warm, very curious and they had this idea that they were helping us Latinos, Asians and Africans climb out of the horrors left over from Colonialism, Mercantilism and the exploitation of Western/Northern Capitalism.  In the US everything costs. You must pay to live in your old age, when you can't work anymore. You must pay for your children to have an education, to have day care, to have healthcare. You must pay to have a home, if you rent then every month, and at any time you can be run out if the owner wants it. There are laws, yes, but they are laws for the Capitalists and not for us.  There is a precarious state of danger over your life in the West that didn't exist in the Soviet Union. Imagine a life where you don't have to worry about debt, or have to worry if you're going to eat or not. Or choose if you're going to feed or clothe your babies because you can't do both.  These are the things we of a certain age remember and feel most. It makes sense for why most Russians (those my age especially) would miss the Soviet Union so dearly.  I hope this answered your questions."
CommunismWorldwide,3d9dqr,lovelybone93,10,Tue Jul 14 21:31:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks, comrade, I am deeply indebted for your doing this. The answer about the US especially hit home, being American.  Another question; did the Soviet higher education system work like most of today's Europe & Asian higher education in that you had two paths; one being trades/apprenticeships, the other college/university with the paths being locked in?"
CommunismWorldwide,3d9dqr,lovelybone93,11,Tue Jul 14 21:39:47 2015 UTC,"I'm happy to do this, I'm happy to see so many young people are still learning about Communism.  On the education question, I gave another answer here about University but let me focus on what you said about the two paths. Yes there were the same two paths of academic pursuit through University or through technical/trade schools. It worked like this:  When you were done with secondary school (so before high school), based on your grades, achievements and your abilities, you would be oriented and encouraged either pursue higher education or vocational education.  At Patrice Lumumba I knew a young woman who was a worker, she had studied a trade (something to do with metal) but had outperformed every other worker in her factory. Her union supported and pushed for her to go to University. And so she did.  The kolkhozes and the unions would support young men and women as a way of giving them a prize for their hard work and dedication in labor. They would use this support to enter a University.  Also for many of the Soviet Union's student population, the big dream was to study in Moscow or Leningrad. The Russian State also promoted and supported vocational, technical and trade schools very heavily. Contrary to how these schools are seen in the West (as not good, less prestigious and such) this wasn't the case in the Soviet Union.  People who went to technical schools did very technical, highly specialized, and very prestigious, competent work. These schools were called the backbone of the Soviet Union, teaching people how to build their lives.  Universities also enjoyed taking people who excelled at these trade schools for themselves. A bit like poaching but more amicable, because they loved calling attention to the fact that they were teaching the sons and daughters of the working class.  It was a big deal. Universities once only served the sons and daughters of the bourgeoisie, but now (then) in the Soviet Union, all the workers were able to access higher learning. The barrier basically was just your grades, but also your dedication."
CommunismWorldwide,3d9dqr,lovelybone93,7,Tue Jul 14 22:12:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks, comrade, so you were mostly locked in, except if you really shined at your job as a trades worker, you could go to college/university. So it was more a meritocracy than the West, then.   What was the quality of the education in the Soviet Union?  How were Soviet doctors and medicine?"
CommunismWorldwide,3d9dqr,Lupyr,8,Tue Jul 14 22:30:52 2015 UTC,"How were Soviet doctors and medicine?   The medicine was at a very good level. Especially major surgery. They had excellent surgeons. Over the counter medicine had some problems though, not in quality but because of the bureaucracy. It was easier to get a prescription that would cut through the red tape, than having to answer many questions to get social-level medicine.  Visually the hospitals were not as big or flashy like they are in the US. They didn't have the big offices and reception rooms, but they got the job done and you didn't have to wait a very long time. So if there is any big difference in terms of quality, I would say it was cosmetic. So rooms and things were drab, but the quality of care still exists.  I would say there are a lot of parallels to the Cuban healthcare system and hospital system.  The cornerstone of the Soviet Healthcare system is that people matter. Not money/insurance matters, like it is in the US. The more money you have, the quicker care you get. Maybe it's romantic of me but this was medicine for the people without worry of money. You were sick? You got help. You needed help? There it was. No one would be left alone if they were in pain.  The Soviet society was very similar otherwise. There were still lawyers, still divorce courts, still cops and judges and all of those things. I think overall the emphasis was always people though. You mattered under Socialism. In Capitalism you only matter if you have money. Or the amount of importance you get in society is proportional to the amount of money in your bank account."

CommunismWorldwide,3d9dqr,Kyte314,7,Tue Jul 14 22:53:29 2015 UTC,How did the education system in the USSR differ from the systems in the US or Western Europe?
CommunismWorldwide,3d9dqr,Kyte314,11,Tue Jul 14 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"The University system was very traditionalistic, so it was very similar to German Universities (more so than the French one) with with lecturers being academic professors, and smaller seminary groups. Students were not able to speak freely during lectures, and the roles or lines that distinguished professors from students were very pronounced. You were able to discuss things with your seminary professor. You could say things like ""what books do I need? What did that thing we saw in the lecture mean"" etc.  Also the grade system was on a 0-5. 0 was really unheard of, it was as if the professor wanted to scalp you or something. The 3 was average and most students achieved this. 4 was extraordinary, 5 was flawless. Exams were mostly oral, not written. Some exams were based on presentation, and had no grade. The professors would listen to your presentation and judge whether you did your work or not.  During those days the University was very rigorous and very demanding, with obligatory library hours for research and you were required (at every level and course) to learn a language other than Russian. For a foreigner you had to keep this up, as well as Russian.  Also sports were very important and was obligatory. You had to participate in a sporting course or physical activity like that.  The relationship between you and the professor was always formal. It was always the formal ""you"" never familiar. Exams also had to be taken with formal dress wear. You had to wear a suit if you were a man and wear equally conservative dress-ware if you were a woman.  I'm trying to tell you little details of things that people don't know. There are more important things, like pedagogical things, technological things. These you can find in books. I hope I gave you a little bit of insight into the perception of a student.  This is all in contrast with the educations I had in Latin America and the Western countries. There Universities are more libertine. You could dress however you like, address the professor how you like, and things are more loose.  Maybe it's because the education was free. In fact it was even paid. You received a student stipend so that you wouldn't need to work while you were studying. Rooms were absolutely guaranteed and free, so the stipend you got was usually spent on food and books.  What fascinated most of us foreign students was being able to, or being easily available, go to concerts. In Western countries going to the opera, to the theater, to the productions and cultural events was and is seen as very elitist. ""Oh I'm going to the opera...""  But the accessibility of being able to assist and see the very finest ballets, operas, and guided tours to museums, all of it was practically free. What you would pay for a bus ticket in the West. People put a very strong emphasis on culture, and it was all very cosmopolitan. You were encouraged to go to concerts.  The difference then, I found, as far as culture shock, was the libertine loud nature of Western colleges where you could question everything, and the very rigorous, and disciplined nature of the Soviet college. On the one hand you had to pay for everything in the first one, and things like the events I mentioned were also expensive and elitist and there was/is no easy access to something like Broadway on a student stipend. But in the Soviet Union, while you had to hold to your schedule and do all the mandatory things, you had a great and almost expense-free social life outside of the University."

CommunismWorldwide,3d9dqr,geckos100,7,Tue Jul 14 22:03:30 2015 UTC,How did elections work?
CommunismWorldwide,3d9dqr,geckos100,10,Tue Jul 14 17:35:23 2015 UTC,"Foreigners didn't really have their finger on the local politics. The city council (soviets) were always candidates that came from worker syndicates, or they were academics, or workers, who were chosen by their unions and then approved by the party. It was very linear. There wasn't the idea of the ""independent"" as it exists in the West. Voting was through a secret ballot to administrative positions for the city or region (oblast), so mayoral candidates and so. Generally from what I was exposed to, you were almost always approved if you were already being chosen by your Union.  Unions of writers, union of metallurgical workers, union of this and that. Everything was very organised, very closed, very formalised.  ""Who is in favour?"" They would ask at the union meetings when it came to a candidate wanting their support. Then they would raise their hands (or not) and later this person, with the approval of their union, would go to the party.  You can learn a lot more from a book than you can from me on this. There are more documented texts on how elections worked, but this was what I learned while I was there."

CommunismWorldwide,3d9dqr,RAGE-REGISTRATION,9,Tue Jul 14 17:52:41 2015 UTC,"Full immersion comrade. At Patrice Lumumba, foreign students like me arrived without knowing any Russian. We had to take an intensive course for 10 months, Monday to Saturday and we took Sunday ""off"" to do tons of homework and reading. We went in at 8 o'clock in the morning and leave the classes at 3 in the afternoon.  We took courses on linguistics, phonetics, writing, reading. All of that. Plus the specific type of Russian you would need for whatever your major was. So if you were going to be an engineer, you would be taught the kind of technical Russian you needed to do it.  We would playfully say between us that if you used this method of learning Russian to teach a rock, in 10 months it would be able to write a thesis on Dostoyevsky."

People (or rather people who've never lived under communism) often complain that communist states are incapable of feeding it's citizens. I've seen pictures of Soviet grocery stores, and while they are certainly less colorful than American ones, they still appear to be stacked to the ceilings with food. In the Soviet Union, how accessible was food? How was the quality of the food? How affordable was it? How do all these things compared to the Russian Federation?  What were your options when it came to alcohol? Were there a variety of beers to chose from? Could you get ""upper-class"" booze like wine or champagne? It is a stereotype that Russians pretty much just drink low-quality vodka in the United States.  How was drug use viewed by society? President Reagan called drug use ""a threat to national security"", was drug use seen as a such a pressing social issue, or did people not really care? What kind of punishment would you expect for possession of drugs? What about punishments for dealing drugs? Were there soviet stoners?  Were people outspoken in support of communism, or did the average person not seem to care much? Was capitalism as much of a political dirty word as communism is in the USA? Was the average person aware of communist theory? What were your economics classes like? In the US we are taught that communism = totalitarianism and are not taught a single thing about the actual ideas of communist or socialist theorists. Were you presented with such a one-sided view of capitalism?  What was television like? Were there commercials? Were there sitcoms, soap operas, and cartoons like western television? How much did the government have to do with the production of these?  Thanks for taking the time to answer questions! No worries if you don't have answers for them all."
CommunismWorldwide,3d9dqr,SolidBlues,6,Tue Jul 14 21:20:14 2015 UTC,"In the Soviet Union, how accessible was food?   Very accessible for the vast majority of people. All of the prices for foods were subsidized, so even things like caviar were affordable for the most humble of workers. Practical packaging was common, so there were no flashy, colorful wrappers and things with little ducks or flowers or cows on cartons and such.  Quality of meat and dairy and other groceries was excellent. There was no concept of the ""cuts"" of meat like you have today in supermarkets. You wouldn't find t-bone stakes. You would buy the kilo of beef and you would have to do the cutting yourself at home. Or take it to the butcher to have it cut for you.  The expensive products were the imported ones, because of the distance and logistics involved. But you would generally be able to find a local substitute. So you might not always have your Finnish cheese, but you had some good Russian cheese. You did get a lot of things from tropical places like Cuba. Bananas were a very interesting, exotic product.  On things with the Russian Federation, I don't know. I never lived there after the Soviet Union fell.   What were your options when it came to alcohol? Were there a variety of beers to chose from? Could you get ""upper-class"" booze like wine or champagne?   Beer consumption was normal, but here's an interesting thing: it wasn't pasteurized. So beers had an expiration date. You had to drink them quick or they would get musky and rancid.  White and Red wines came from Moldavia and the southern Socialist Republics. They were high quality, and their sparkling wines were a big deal too. Believe it or not it was also accessible to every person. You would always see a bottle of Soviet sparkling wine on every table during a birthday or other celebration.  You could never do without a great bottle of vodka of course. It was excellent! In the ""verioska"" shops, you could buy imported alcohols from all over the world, but as usual because of the imported nature it was also expensive. If you saved up a bit you could access it though, but usually locals didn't bother too much trying to drink that when they had good quality local things.   How was drug use viewed by society? President Reagan called drug use ""a threat to national security"", was drug use seen as a such a pressing social issue, or did people not really care? What kind of punishment would you expect for possession of drugs? What about punishments for dealing drugs? Were there soviet stoners?   There were drugs like Hashish that came from the southern Republics, but it was mostly consumed by elderly. Youngsters in cities used it only a little because it was expensive, and you could get yourself into trouble with the police. The police had a very strong grip on the flow of drugs. It wasn't a social problem at all in those days. I don't really know what the kinds of punishments, but I would think you would go to jail for a while. But it wasn't easy to get access. There weren't a lot of dealers because the police really had very strong, iron grip on it.   Were people outspoken in support of communism, or did the average person not seem to care much? Was capitalism as much of a political dirty word as communism is in the USA?   People took it for granted, and it was just natural and the normal way that things should be. Most people (when you asked them) would be proud about the fact that they were building Communism. Or at least what they thought was building Communism. There wasn't much knowledge that they were living under a revisionist version, or a corruption, of State Socialism. In general the idea was ""we are building something different. Something more just. A society that is more equal and better for all"". This was my impression from the observations and talks I had with people.  If you asked a top artist, like a great violinist, they would probably tell you ""I don't like this, I'm tired of it"" because in the West a person like that would make millions. But for the common person? They were content.  Capitalist societies were seen as horrible, exploitative countries where a minority ruled over a vast majority. Where the United States mistreated it's people. Capitalism wasn't seen as ""dirty"", or something to be afraid of, more like ""we need to destroy it! We need to free those people!"" That was more or less the consensus. There was the odd person who talked about what it might be like to be rich, but usually the next words were ""but at what cost to my comrades?""  ""We cannot live like the Americans, but rule in sports, and we rule in space, and we rule in medicine, and we rule in all these other great things, so screw those people with their fancy cars and Hollywood starlets.""   Was the average person aware of communist theory? What were your economics classes like? In the US we are taught that communism = totalitarianism and are not taught a single thing about the actual ideas of communist or socialist theorists. Were you presented with such a one-sided view of capitalism?   Like in all places they did try to sell you their socio-economic system. Especially to us foreigners. To try and prove and show you that their way was better. So yes there was some propaganda, but no more than you would get anywhere else. I was more observant of it because I went there to study History, so I would always ask myself these questions twice, to really consider what I was being taught and shown.  All the social sciences and disciplines based themselves on Dialectical Materialism, and so it wasn't something you could avoid learning about. So I think its fair to say that most people who went to a Soviet University would get that knowledge in theory.   What was television like? Were there commercials? Were there sitcoms, soap operas, and cartoons like western television? How much did the government have to do with the production of these?   It was more like super PBS. All of it was like a big PBS on steroids. Yes they had movies and soap operas, but generally for us foreigners TV was very boring. It did have quality content though. A lot of content for children too. A lot of cartoons, fairy-tales, all kinds of things with animation, still-motion and theater for children.  The government had 100% a hand in these things. Directors did have a lot of latitude, but writers had to turn in scripts to the State and the Producers were always part of the Government. In the 80s you had a lot of great directors though, and the production house owned by the government was called Mosfilms. It still exists today. These were movies that received recognition worldwide. You should watch Solaris, the original movie, that's an example of a good Soviet one that Clooney remade recently."

CommunismWorldwide,3d9dqr,Adahn5,8,Tue Jul 14 23:37:53 2015 UTC,"I think the explanation is like when you go to the doctor and you're told you have a terminal illness. You're frightened, you become anguished, you lose faith and confidence in yourself, and you enter a state of shock. That state of shock, translated to a society, is that events move forward so quickly that they leave you behind. The army, the party, the academics, no one knew what the hell was going on. But the reasoning of the bureaucratic elite was that there was no more money, it all collapsed. Who do you blame, who do you trust? The party? The leaders? The unions? The army? Who was complicit.  This isn't an academic answer, or one that provides a Marxist, or Anarchist analysis of the collapse. You can find that from scholarly articles and other sources discussed here or in good forums that use these analyses to come to an honest and factual conclusion. This is just my perception of what happened, my own feelings on it when I was living Czechkoslovakia with my wife and son. Every one of us that saw, lived and breathed the Soviet Union were like punched in the stomach. Many former comrades lost faith in the system after the collapse and others felt vindicated because they had never supported it.  The Soviet Union (especially after Khrushchov) was not the kind of Socialism we want. It was State Capitalism, even if the State was more caring of the people than it is under Liberal Capitalism. If gradation matters, it was better than what we have in most countries in the world. It gives us a blueprint to what we can do, what we can avoid, and how we can do it better."
CommunismWorldwide,3d9dqr,TotesMessenger,6,Tue Jul 14 23:08:56 2015 UTC,Why did the USSR revert to capitalism?   How would that be possible? Socialism/communism isn't a set of national policies.
CommunismWorldwide,3d9dqr,sillandria,6,Tue Jul 14 23:59:18 2015 UTC,"It's as comrade /u/abisiden said. The analysis of it's collapse that most people subscribe to is that it was in part due to the Arms & Space races causing the Soviet Union to spend most of it's GDP on weapons, but due to the fact that it had positive GDP growth, I prefer the following theory that the Soviet coordinator class of elites, which the Kosygin reform turned into proto-Capitalists (and as proto-Capitalists wanted to become real Capitalists), and were given allowances by the pre-perestroika economic troubles, came to the decision that the reforms Gorbachev was making weren't in their best interest, and so they embraced Neoliberalism and abandoned the planned economic system in favour of unregulated markets that better aligned with their desires.  The Soviet union was essentially then sold off bit by bit with the argument that ""State Property"" didn't belong to anyone, and so all of the people's assets and factories were sold off to private, international interests. It's what I believe gave rise to oligarchy we see in Russia today, with people like the dead fuck Nemtsov.  Yeltsin's coup finished accumulating wealth into the hands of former elites who switched allegiance when it was politically expedient, and spread the myth that communism ""just doesn't work cause see what happened? The people want Democracy!"" When the people were never fucking consulted, as it shown by today's polls where most Russians want the Soviet Union back.  As I said before, there are other analyses of course—some of which might touch on Joseph Ball's economic analysis of the Soviet Union or perhaps others who'll focus on the effects of spending. But I like to think that it was because of the internal contradictions of Capitalism (State Capitalism in this case) that did them in. I mean even the guy that some people tout as a hero who was trying to ""save the Soviet Union"" through reforms: Gorbachev, fucking said the following...  """"My ambition was to liquidate communism"". He wanted to preserve the Soviet Union as a proto-Empire made up of Capitalist provinces like the EU, not reform it into an alliance of socialist, democratic countries. This was a guy who had no love for the Communist party, and wanted Russia to become a Social Democracy like Canada."

Lenin was certainly aware...   State capitalism is that form of capitalism which we shall be in a position to restrict, to establish its limits; this capitalism is bound up with the State, and the State – that is the workers, the most advanced part of the workers, the vanguard, is us. And it is we on whom the nature of this state capitalism will depend.   and   The state capitalism, which is one of the principal aspects of the New Economic Policy, is, under Soviet power, a form of capitalism that is deliberately permitted and restricted by the working class. Our state capitalism differs essentially from the state capitalism in countries that have bourgeois governments in that the state with us is represented not by the bourgeoisie, but by the proletariat, who has succeeded in winning the full confidence of the peasantry.   In this sense, Soviet Russia was nothing but a worker-led capitalism (which is debatable)."

One UBC PhD candidate wrote his entire thesis without using standardized capitals, punctuation or paragraphs in what was essentially a 52,000 word long sentence. Naturally there were objections to the work, done to push back against “the blind acceptance of English language conventions in academia.”   There are legitimate arguments against academia being elitist but this is not one.   Initially he had written his thesis in his indigenous Nisga language, but he was forced to translate it into English, which again highlights the way in which the English language dominates university. The result is that anyone who cannot speak, read or write in English, is excluded from discussions and debates. They are denied knowledge and are unable to share their own. These are essentially white academic norms, which play a key role in maintaining a white curriculum.   Are we supposed to be outraged that one is expected to write in English at an English speaking university?   Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o has done his own work to highlight these issues by announcing in his excellent Decolonizing The Mind that he would not write in English again. He asserts that writing in English and then having his work translated into his native Kiswahili excludes a lot of people from reading his work as the meaning of it is inevitably changed. Instead, he now exclusively writes in Kiswahili, although his work can be found translated into English, it is written for a Kiswahili speaking audience, not an English speaking one.   That's awesome for them, but in the grand scheme of things why does it matter?"

""Say what you are going to say; say it; then say what you said""--the essay summed up in its totalizing manner which attempts to present a closed manner of presentation creating a false sense of finality to the thesis, one that may be acknowledged as false and artificial, but one ""speaks for affect, not truth"" so that hardly matters. What become thought of as the breakdown of high and low culture has now become the colonization of popular culture by the white male norms of academia; blurs began to appear between the hip and the nerd; now we have nerdy hipsters and hip nerds, but all coalesce into an imperialist tendency towards assimilating alien ideas, cultures, into the chimera of the post-internet age.   Today nobody could get away with making such a distinction. Since 1959, we have come to live among flows of data more vast than anything the world has seen. Demystification is the order of our day, all the cats are jumping out of all the bags and even beginning to mingle. We immediately suspect ego insecurity in people who may still try to hide behind the jargon of a specialty or pretend to some data base forever ''beyond'' the reach of a layman. Anybody with the time, literacy and access fee these days can get together with just about any piece of specialized knowledge s/he may need. So, to that extent, the two-cultures quarrel can no longer be sustained. As a visit to any local library or magazine rack will easily confirm, there are now so many more than two cultures that the problem has really become how to find the time to read anything outside one's own specialty. (Pynchon, 1984)   But, alas!, the old guards of knowledge remain, bound as they are by the prison of the Tower, keeping watch over what can be allowed into that privileged realm of ""truth"" that so dominates our lives.   The idea of an alternative cannot truly be presented as long as such standards exist. The personal experience of many people is regarded as meaningless if they cannot theorize their arguments, foot note them and properly cite their sources. The result is that the majority of people discussing indigenous ideologies, for instance, are white ethnographers, not indigenous people themselves.   We can only know things through this vanguard as they are related to us through the White Man, the idiocy of times supposedly gone by, that still remains because power and wealth and knowledge always mingle and always will till the power of each is removed."

Trotsky, who had once called Petrograd and Krondstad the ""pride and glory of the Russian Revolution"" later stepped in to repress these workers, calling them ""White Guardists"".  Earlier, in 1920, the Makhnovists were put down hard by Trotsky and Lenin, who invited the Crimean Makhnovists to a military council, and promptly betrayed, ambushed and arrested them for daring to support stateless communism.  Fast forward to Anarchist Catalonia, where Stalinists worked hard to encourage private ownership in order to undermine the CNT.  ""Soviets"", a term that originally meant worker councils, was soon coopted by the USSR state. ""All power to the Soviets"" took on a double meaning as Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin grew power hungry. Lenin openly praised state monopoly such as the German state Kriegwirtschaft. Trade Unions were purged, consumer cooperatives were next, and Trotsky acknowledged later that worker calls for democracy were also shut down.

They did call into question the belief in Patriarchy as feminists believe it, but they didn't do it in a way to denounce fighting for womens rights.  They were happy for the progression feminism has managed to achieve, but they had a slightly different view on sexism. They weren't saying women had more power then men, but and its hard to describe that sexism wasn't due to because either gender was always more powerful then the other.  I know you might automatically feel repulsed, but they weren't denying womens struggle or sexism against women, so it seemed to be a genuine attempt to logically analyse society.  I feel like people here were downplaying biology's effect on sexuality and gender. I can understand why people are upset for me in believing in this but, just because science institutions exist in Capitalists society doesn't mean everything they say is wrong. It seems rather dishonest to pick and choose which things in science you want to believe.  I want to clarify that I'm not condoning or defending any MRA who does spout reactionary views, but I'm starting to think denouncing them all as reactionary was done too hastily and there wasn't enough attempts to find and communicate with ones who were progressive.  But I don't want to remain here if It's believed I will be a negative influence. I still care about all of you and want you all to be treated fairly and equally.  EDIT: After looking into it, they claimed a lot of things, but reading their comments they weren't really honest about what they said and what they were doing. Ignore what I said I take my comments about them back."

He thinks he can work his way up from being a store employee for verizon and eventually get his own store or become a high ranking manager or something like that.  He keeps telling me about some of the dreams he has too.  All about him becoming super fucking rich and being a CEO and having all sorts of expensive cars and a mansion.  I've even shown him a few of Richard Wolff's videos explaining exploitation/labor theory of value.  The worst part is that to some degree he accepts that there is exploitation, and yet he still aspires to be a successful capitalist.  I mean, I don't want him to be stuck with his shitty uncomfortable low-paying job as a sales employee, but I try to explain to him that doesn't mean he has to become part of the bourgeoisie.  Also, Facebook has become quite the reactionary shit-show for me lately.  It probably always has been but I've simply become better at noticing it lately. It's always shit like this:  ""Muh freeze peach"" ""Muh bad apples"" ""Muh store windows"" ""Muh Heritage"" ""Muh freedumbs isn't free"" ""Muh Family values"" ""Muh reverse racism"" ""Muh thugs"" ""Muh feminazis"" ""Muh gun control"" ""Muh right to bear arms"" ""Muh liberal values""  Fuck your liberal values.  I know I could easily just unfriend all the reactionaries, but I think I'd rather give them a chance at coming to a better perspective of things, or simply wait for them to unfriend me if they don't like the occasional dialectically astute observation or the dank onion articles."

It was weird.. the owners of these silk factories would insist that you see how the silk was produced, and so I watched it. I didnt see any kids working in these places but I did meet a few (they must have been 13 years old) who told me they made shawls..   In other news I am very close to negotiating a wage with who I hope to be my future employer. I am honestly not entirely sure why they need someone with my ""skillset,"" but they seem keen enough to get me or someone like me.

Group of liberals in the smoking area of a bar I was at broke out in singing ""god save the queen"" so I let them finish and shouted ""fuck the queen, fuck the monarchy, no rulers, no masters, the proletarian revolution is coming"". Some huge guy came up to me and was like ""what the hell how can you say that?"" and I told him if he supports the monarchy then he supports the oppression of the working people. He told me he worked for minimum wage and I told him then he should be on the side of the working people and to start read the communist manifesto. I got the typical ignorant liberal response of ""communism and sharing stuff all sounds nice but you have to work"" so I told him that he doesn't have class consciousness and is therefore an enemy of the proletariat. At this point I was pretty wound up and it could have got physical but I had a lot of friends with me (and maybe I could've taken the guy cos he was much taller but once you get this deep into the class struggle, you start to physically train yourself in case you need to defend the proles or even join liberals in fighting fascists if we need to). I ended up just telling him that he should read before spouting ignorant shit because it was obvious everything he seemed to ""know"" about communism was based off bourgeois media/propaganda. I left shouting ""workers of the world unite, eat the rich"" and shortly after that I ended up leaving the bar cos my bday friend had gone home to puke and the other guys said we were staying there for another couple of hours and I preferred other bars cos that one gets shit at 3am.   Anyway comrades, how open are you in public about your communism? I like to push the limits in the hopes that I'll see a fellow comrade in the wild (also, I've come to care less for individual people and find it funny that the politico-legal system that protects these petty bourgeois fools would also protect me somewhat thanks to liberal biopolitique).

Of course, but that doesn't mean they didn't also work hard and apply themselves.   Should I attend college and be indebted?   That's for you to decide but it doesn't sound to me like you'd get the most out of it."

CommunismWorldwide,3cjvcz,Kestos,3,Wed Jul 8 23:32:12 2015 UTC,"Ha x3 Sure. But it's not about swearing. You can say piss, shit, cock, fuck all you like. It's about the oppression certain words perpetuate. Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic or classist slurs are among them. ""Bitch"", for instance, insults a woman purely because of her gender. When used on a man it carries a comparison to being a woman, which is in turn bad due to the nature of the insult."
CommunismWorldwide,3cjvcz,sillandria,-1,Wed Jul 8 23:39:45 2015 UTC,"The word I previously used is inherently identical to cock in everything but gender, and the word fuck also has gender-specific tones in that it implies the male part of the act. I'm no red-piller by any means, but I do enjoy a good swear and the ones which don't inherently offend a group of people are simply no good to anyone.   Swearing is inherently offensive and follows linguistic trends, Western Europe goes for the genitals and implies people/their parents work in the sex industry, Eastern Europe it's more about bestiality. Might as well end up abandoning the whole fudging piece of sugar.   However if this is actually a widespread thing where I'm from and not just on the internet it's a sad day as the English language loses its best swear word. I remain hopeful however as my extraordinarily feminist mother (she really does cross the line to the point where my own male gender is to blame for a lot of things) utters the word  risking the banhammer (bansickle?) on a daily basis without seeming offended.  I'd just like to re-iterate the sentiment that the Tories can go ride the central line in rush hour. Aka lick the sweat of Lucifer's ballbag the bunch of pustulent cock-guzzlers."
CommunismWorldwide,3cjvcz,Kestos,2,Wed Jul 8 23:56:36 2015 UTC,"It is not about offense; it is about oppression. ""Bitch"" is used to silence women's voices, thus it shouldn't be used. ""Dick"" isn't used to silence voices, rather it is a general insult."

I never would, fully aware of all the connotations of that one. Most of my comments here are tongue in cheek but I really do lament the lack of proper swear terms in the English language. Even if you include the really offensive (aka bigoted) words you can't really really make someone realise the true level of your vehemence against them without getting really creative and linking whole phrases together. There should be a word which means ""happy with the way things are and running the world to shit causing a mess on top of being a generally horrid person"", but those people are happy to be called fascists :/"

I read that PIV is always rape, OK? article about a year and some months ago, and of course, being a cis man, I was turned off by the title and the conclusion, but I felt uncomfortable about not being able to refute the essence: sex and sexuality are grounded in our environment, and thus a patriarchal society produces patriarchal sex.  Since reading the PIV article, I've had fleeting thoughts coming close to that of this Consent article. For example:   I have to be super duper careful when having sex, especially with a girl. Even if they say yes to everything. PIV seems weird. [About my crush] I like her, and it's because I like her that  I don't want to exploit her.   However, because of the hegemony of the liberal consent model, I suppress these feelings.  I guess it's good to know I'm not alone in this respect."

I'm not an expert at any of this, since I don't have any experience with sex and relationships, but nothing about society will ever make what you agree with someone else, something fundamentally different then what you agreed to.  Institutions can be effected and social interactions can be influenced but beyond that theories get too abstract and contrived to make any sense.

So consent works because consent works because... consent works?   Men having an advantage over women in society=all sex is rape. Yes, quite convincing.   Brown never claims in this article that all sex is rape. In fact, they leave it as an open question in the conclusion:    But is all sex rape? Recall that at the beginning of this piece, we said that rape is central to gender oppression because it transforms the victim into a “being for another.” But as our argument developed, we saw that this is true, to some extent or another, of all sex. Is a distinction between rape and sex in general even meaningful? Some, notably the Maoist Internationalist Movement, have argued that all sex under patriarchy is in fact rape. On the other hand, we might find that there is some usefulness in denoting some distinction between the average heterosexual relationship and, say, sex trafficking. For now, we leave this an open question [emphasis mine]."

CommunismWorldwide,3cj79r,Varroun,2,Thu Jul 9 20:46:03 2015 UTC,"IDK, this article seems too long-winded for a simple thing.   Rape is forcing or coercion of a person to have sex with someone, whether it be by violence, under threat of violence, by taking advantage of someone with diminished reasoning capacity like the mentally disabled or someone who's too drunk to consent and because of social norms, that sex is expected in situations. Consent can be revoked at any time, want can disappear at any time.  E: grammar"

Toward the end there was a claim that sexuality was entirely socially constructed and had nothing to do with reproduction. I honestly can't see how anyone could come to this conclusion.  Its like saying we get hungry not because we need to eat but because were socially conditioned to.  It came close to saying all sex is rape and opts to leaving it open ended. I honestly can't take anyone seriously if they think this is even remotely true.  This article operates under the common social belief that sex is something men do to women.  Women feeling depressed after sex is much more likely related to residual protestant values that sex is inherently bad and ""dirty"" and that women should remain ""pure"".  I guarantee you the percentage of women feeling depressed after sex is much lower in Europe then the United States.

I honestly can't see how anyone could come to this conclusion.  Its like saying we get hungry not because we need to eat but because were socially conditioned to.   Sorry, but Jesus fucking Christ why doesn't anybody ever fucking know what social construction means!  To give an example from the eating metaphor: Yes, you have to eat because of hunger. Now, what to eat? Um . . . all of your choices will be mediated through social systems unless you grow your own, but your choice to grow your own will itself be the result of social conditioning, so that can be said to be socially constructed. But what about hunger itself? Well, guess what? Women that are constantly on a diet often misinterpret their signs of hunger and the stress relating to it as just a personally weak willpower i.e. the signs of hunger are, in some sense, socially constructed. Social construction =/= no basis in matter, rather it states that how we understand phenomenon depends upon social semiotic systems. So the material can limit the interpretation, but there is always an element of variability. If you talk about something, it is in some sense socially constructed since you can talk about it.  So in this case, yes sex can be socially constructed and yes it can have something to do with reproduction. These are not mutually exclusive."

CommunismWorldwide,3cj79r,Varroun,4,Thu Jul 9 00:10:07 2015 UTC,"Well, sexuality is a political institution so . . .   The extension of this assumption is the frequently heard assertion that in a world of genuine equality, where men were nonoppressive and nurturing, everyone would be bisexual. Such a notion blurs and sentimentalizes the actualities within which women have experienced sexuality; it is the old liberal leap across the tasks and struggles of here and now, the continuing process of sexual definition that will generate its own possibilities and choices. (It also assumes that women who have chosen women have done so simply because men are oppressive and emotionally unavailable: which still fails to account for women who continue to pursue relationships with oppressive and/or emotionally unsatisfying men.) I am suggesting that heterosexuality, like mother-hood, needs to be recognized and studied as a political institution--even, or especially, by those individuals who feel they are, in their personal experience, the precursors of a new social relation between the sexes."

CommunismWorldwide,3cj79r,ilikebuildingsheds,3,Wed Jul 8 20:29:37 2015 UTC,"It's not very fuzzy at all, and who are you to decide what ""true consent"" is?

CommunismWorldwide,3cj79r,ilikebuildingsheds,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:39:03 2015 UTC,"But Varroun it is fuzzy. We women are very often cajoled into having sex, and what ""consent"" might be present is not always willful. Men are overwhelmingly the ones capable of forcing sex, of imposing themselves, and whether physically or through manipulation, emotional or mental, it happens.   7% of college-aged men admit to attempting rape  http://www.alternet.org/education/wh-reports-shocking-stat-7-college-men-admit-attempting-rape-most-them-multiple-times  1 in 3 admit they would attempt it  http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/01/11/3610327/college-men-forcible-sex-study/  See that when the word ""rape"" is used, they say no.

CommunismWorldwide,3cj79r,Varroun,2,Thu Jul 9 01:38:18 2015 UTC,Sigh . . . only because the criminal definition of rape is based on the consent model. Sex is power. Rape is the forceful assertion of this power in sexual circumstances. Not all of this will fall into what courts would consider crime nor should it be since criminal justice is just another expression of control and power.

Kurdish civilians are often killed in the bombardments. They happen by mistake, according to them, but we believe they want to maintain a kind of equilibrium between the jihadis and the Kurdish combatants. If the coalition wants to bomb a cigarette they do it. Sometimes we ask for targeted attacks and they say it's not possible to proceed. Many jihadi fighters have weapons from the United States or Turkey. Yet, for months we haven't received enough weapons.""  And:   ""Religion exploits death: if you're a martyr you go to heaven.

Better urban planning, high density housing, and a huge focus on public transportation would greatly reduce the need for cars.  tl;dr: we need to start treating the Earth and our economy the way we would go about building a moon base; entirely self contained, highly efficient, and only really relying on an abundant sources of energy as its main input."

CommunismWorldwide,3c8jhd,Godeliva,3,Sun Jul 5 22:16:21 2015 UTC,"Thus, in terms of understanding women’s relationship to these dualisms, a logical formulation within Marx’s thought would be to point out that biology is certainly relevant. However, biology cannot be viewed as such outside of the social relations of a particular society. This can potentially help to avoid the biologistic and deterministic arguments of some radical and socialist feminists who essentialize “women’s nature,” while at the same time avoiding relativism since, in Marx’s view, the world is not completely socially constructed. Rather, biology and nature are important variables when viewed within a socially mediated framework.   I do not see how ""biology and nature are important variables when viewed within a socially mediated framework"" can mean anything other than that gender is socially constructed, since social construction is concerned with how knowledge is situated within ""socially mediated framework[s]"". That there are inter-subjectively provable phenomenon does not prove that social construction does not play a part in our discourse.  Also, this article conflates two different definition's of nature; one being the opposite of civilization (nature/culture) and the other being ""essence"" in the sense of Human Nature (woman's nature). This is important since biology falls under the nature part of the nature/culture divide in common usage but not, necessarily, under the ""essence"" sense, making the usage here muddled."

As far as whether he is socialist, his writings tend to be more sympathetic to anarchy, which is still socialism, but his anarchy is more concerned with the totalitarian nature of discourse itself rather than focusing on capitalism specifically. His writings mention capitalism only as a one of the many such systems, including Calvinism, Spiritualism, War, Statistics, Psychoanalysis, etc. Imperialism in particular, and its association with global capital, comes up quite a bit in his writings. V and Gravity's Rainbow in particular have sections dealing with the effects of imperialism, both dealing with the real life Herero people, V with their genocide under German General Lothar von Trotha, and Gravity's Ranibow dealing with a group of Herero's assimilation into the German military during the Second World War and their subsequent ""self-genocide"" as their identities lose meaning. One could also draw the comparison between Pynchon's delaing with War in general and its relation to capitalism, what with the totalitarian nature of the War consuming everyone and reducing them to mere numbers and statistics, reducing human life to the same category as other commodities:   What more do they want? She asks this seriously, as if there's a real conversion factor between information and lives. Well, strange to say, there is. Written down in the Manual, on file at the War Department. Don't forget the real business of the War is buying and selling. The murdering and violence are self-policing, and can be entrusted to non-professionals. The mass nature of wartime death is useful in many ways. It serves as a spectacle, as a diversion from the real movements of the War. It provides raw material to be recorded into History, so that children may be taught History as sequences of violence, battle after battle, and be more prepared for the adult world. Best of all, mass death's a stimulus to just ordinary folks, little fellows, to try 'n' grab a piece of that Pie while they're still here to gobble it up. The true war is a celebration of markets. Organic markets, carefully styled ""black"" by the professionals, spring up everywhere. Scrip, Sterling, Reichsmarks, continue to move, severe as classical ballet, inside their antiseptic marble chambers. But out here, down here among the people, the truer currencies come into being.

Edwards is correct. The Dixie flag, Confederate statues, and the racism that ooze from both are a part of Southern heritage. That is rather damning, especially considering the role the United States played in aggressively denazifying Germany and Austria after the Second World War.  Why did Denazification work?   Germany wasn't really unified as a nation, The Allies aggressively pursued the most fervent Nazis and spread anti-fascist propaganda all over Germany and Austria, and Nazi Germany ruled for only twelve years.   Meanwhile, the United States did not engage in a similar programme to Denazification (and still has not). Purges of Confederates (and white nationalists in general) did not occur, there has been no Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and the general extent of anti-racist propaganda supported by the American state treats racism as an individual problem of the past rather than a systemic problem of the present. Moreover, it has been one-hundred fifty years since the Civil War, much longer than twelve.  Unfortunately, these things will never happen until the very existence of the United States is called into question. For, in a way, racism and white nationalism  is not a bug in the program of American politics - it's a feature."

CommunismWorldwide,3bjbpw,Cyridius,4,Wed Jul 1 22:24:16 2015 UTC,"Trotskyism was the Leninist counter-current to Official Communism and later Marxism-Leninism. Historically it has considered itself the ""Left Opposition"" to OffCom while OffCom was still a thing.  A lot of people mistake the Transitional Demand for reformism. Demands come in two forms; Firstly, demands of the state, and demands of the organs of the working class.   Given that Trotskyists have historically been the minority(Which is something that still psychologically effects Trotskyist orgs even though this is in many cases no longer true), Trotskyists have never had the ability to directly exert power. So their recourse was to make demands of those who could, that is the mass workers' parties and the state.   This served two purposes: It exposed workers to their ideas and to inadequacies of the leaderships of the mass workers' parties, whilst not actually opposing the movement itself - for example Trotsky was a supporter of the Soviet Union but was highly critical of it and challenged its policies and theoretical direction. A modern example might be how Socialist Alternative makes demands of Bernie Sanders to run as an independent candidate in order to form a workers' movement.   Similarly, Trotskyists make demands of the state. Nationalise the banks, nationalise the rails, provide social housing, things like that. These demands are made in the context of a mass movement, and this is the most common form of activity you'll see Trotskyists doing today due to the absence of hegemonic workers' organisations. These demands are constructed in an attempt to bring these mass movements of workers into conflict with capital. A Capitalist for example wouldn't like his gas fields taken into public ownership, or exactly appreciate the nationalisation of the banking system.   This serves a dual purpose; If your demands gain traction and the movement succeeds, it raises class consciousness and shows workers their own power. If your demands gain traction and the movement fails, it exposes workers to the inadequacy of the system to act in their interests.  This is the ""reformism"" of Trotskyism in a nutshell. It still is very much a revolutionary tendency and these demands are made in the context of driving workers in that direction.  As for Permanent Revolution, the theory is less esoteric than people make it out to be. The thesis was as follows;  Tsarist Russia does not have the productive forces necessary for Socialism as it is a backwards country on the periphery of Capitalist development.   Therefore Russia does not have the industrial proletariat of necessary size capable of taking power in society. As a result, the workers will be dependent on a technically skilled bureaucracy to manage affairs of the state, and this will erode the democracy of the revolution.  On top of this, if a society does not have the developed productive forces to care for the needs of society as a whole, then - as Marx said - all the ""old crap"" will be resurrected. That is, because there's not enough to go around, there will inevitably be a privileged section of society(And obviously those who control who gets the privileges will give it to themselves and their families).   This will lead to a growing gap of inequality between the privileged strata and the general population and ultimately a disconnection between the two sections of the population. On top of the erosion of democracy, the privileged strata will develop to the stage where establishment of Socialism will no longer be in their material interests and then Capitalist restoration will inevitably occur, unless there is a second revolution. A state where this process had already begun was called a Degenerated Workers' State.  Ultimately, then, for the revolution to survive, it must spread to the developed centres, as because these centres have the developed productive forces, they have the proletariat capable of taking control of society and managing it in their own interests independent of a bureaucracy.  Trotsky also claimed that a revolutionary proletariat which would continue to push forward its revolutionary demands after the revolution itself could combat this trend and bring things on the path back to Socialism, but this of course leads back to the problem of Russia's weak proletariat to start with."

Reddit MRAs have never visited Tumblr; they get all of their information about it from the subreddit /r/TumblrInAction. Because of this, they think everyone on Tumblr is a radical feminist, when in reality, there are some feminists, some MRAs, some fence-sitters, etc. Their idea of a radical feminist is someone who wants men to be oppressed. Many times feminists on Tumblr will make jokes about wanting to kill all men, and they will be posted to /r/TumblrInAction, where everyone will take it seriously. Because they have been brainwashed about Tumblr feminists, they think even the mildest feminist wants female supremacy, or something like that, so they meet all feminist criticism with the thought-terminating cliche ""Go back to Tumblr."" Arguing with them is like arguing with a wall. The best thing to do is to not engage them, and talk to anyone who is actually interested in feminism."

Inclusion has been tried and women have been raped and attacked by males claiming to be trans.   Yet you provide no source. I highly fucking doubt that actual trans woman give a flying fuck about assaulting other women. We are much more concerned with not getting raped ourselves.   Feminists have tried to have a conversation with the LGBT about theses issues, but the track record of trans people doxxing, insulting, intimidating and threatening women has only caused most feminists to be highly turned off from the idea of any inclusion.   Again, fucking sources, where are they?   I was an lgbt advocate for twenty years and left the fold after repeatedly being threatened by trans women because I dared to ask such a simple questions as ""what is a woman"" or making the statement that female biology DOES matter in the female experience.    Just because I don't get periods nor can get pregnant does not exclude me from being a woman. You are essentializing the experiences of woman into biological determinism.   as a result of many narcissistic straight males whom have a sexist sissification fetish insist women OWE them sex and spaces and silence about our own experiences   Have you ever thought that maybe, just maybe, the reason why trans people don't like you very much is because you call us shit like ""narcissistic straight males whom have a sexist sissification fetish""? The absolute fuck does sissification even mean?   insist women OWE them sex and spaces and silence about our own experiences   No jackass. We only ask them not to hate on us for having different genitals, to not deny us the same rights as other women, and not to essentialize the experiences of women into cissnormative molds. Not that hard to ask.   The material dialectic makes it CLEAR that female experience is rooted in a material biology   Fucking lol. As though personal identity isn't a material thing as well under materialism.   to call one a woman for embracing the same stereotypes that oppress women is disingenuous and counter productive to Marxist politics   1, don't care about your whining about Marxist politics of the ""dialectic"" or whatever. 2, I am not a woman because I embrace any kinda stereotypes, I am a woman because my personal identity is and can never be anything other than that which society deems a woman.

I am instead thinking of distributing something like brochures, something small to pique their interest in communism. I thought of printing out Why Socialism? by Albert Einstein, because it is a good introduction to socialism, it is short, and people will be interested when they see Einstein is the author. However, the essay spans 5 pages. If any comrades here are good at design, could any of you try to make it fit on a brochure that is created from an 8.5 x 11"" sheet of paper, and still have it be readable and look nice?

CommunismWorldwide,3a496s,A_Google_User,2,Wed Jun 17 12:59:53 2015 UTC,"At least the two are treated as contradictory, but I don't exactly understand why.   Not always. Autonomists essentially ascribe to the same libertarian tendency that embodies Anarchism, whilst still subscribing to the majority of Marx's theories. I really think comrade /u/Capn_Blackbeard might give you a better answer on why Anarchists reject Marxism than I could. Edit: And he did! Hurray!  You can see a lot of their reasoning in this video. Some Anarchists are convinced that the dictatorship of the proletariat, given State form, becomes inherently oppressive because of the corrupting influence that having State Power engenders in its office-holders. They have an analysis of the State and Hierarchy that stipulates the advent of a Coordinator class of bureaucrats. In fact there's quite some overlap between Anarchist theory and Trotskyist theory of the Degenerate/Deformed Worker's State and State Capitalism.   I've never heard of similar movements in Africa however (excluding South Africa). This is more of a AskHistorians question, but why was this so?   There were quite a few movements in central Africa, and even in Northern Africa and the Middle-East, but under different guises. For instance, Thomas Sankara in Burkina Faso, who was called the Castro of Africa. There was also Patrice Lumumba after whom the Soviet Union named it's People's Friendship University when my father studied there, who was the equivalent of Allende to the Congolese people, and captured State power through electoral means. In North Africa and the Middle-East these struggles took the form of Ba'athism, an attempt to bring about Socialism through Pan-Arabism and Islam.  The reason more of these didn't take place, however, was primarily because of American interventionism. Both Thomas Sankara and Patrice Lumumba were assassinated either directly or indirectly by the CIA, and other Socialist governments such as those in Afghanistan were subverted by local anti-Communist militias also funded by the United States.  As for book recommendations, since we talked about him, why not read Women's Liberation and the African Freedom Struggle by Thomas Sankara? There's also To Die for the People which is a collection of Huey Newton's writings. You'll get a lot the Marxist analysis of the Black Panther movement in the US."

None of these are dictatorships of the proletariat, yet all of these had a State that, to one degree or another, began this downward spiral of forestallment, revisionism and ultimately a return to Capitalism upon their collapse.

In a time when many US ""Marxists"" were speaking to segregated crowds and espousing a doctrine of the complete removal of black people from the continent (""peacefully,"" of course ^_^), Debs was vehemently opposed to any differentiation between white workers and black workers. In one essay, he said:   The Elgin writer says that we shall ""jeopardize the best interests of the Socialist Party"" if we insist upon the political equality of the Negro. I say that the Socialist Party would be false to its historic mission, violate the fundamental principles of Socialism, deny its philosophy and repudiate its own teachings if, on account of race considerations, it sought to exclude any human being from political equality and economic freedom. Then, indeed, would it not only ""jeopardize"" its best interests, but forfeit its very life, for it would soon be scorned and deserted as a thing unclean, leaving but a stench in the nostrils of honest men.   Another famous quote of his is pretty cool too:   I am not a Labor Leader; I do not want you to follow me or anyone else; if you are looking for a Moses to lead you out of this capitalist wilderness, you will stay right where you are. I would not lead you into the promised land if I could, because if I led you in, some one else would lead you out.

Graffiti is heavily policed, street cleaners are more thorough etc etc.  Poor communities on the other hand, as you'd expect in a  hyper-capitalist city like new york, are isolated from their neighbors. Many are also overworked. So people are too tired to clean their street and don't really care about a community they don't see as their own. HOWEVER, when you visit neighborhoods centered around a certain ethnic identity, there are far more communal projects and neighborhood pride etc.  It's also worth mentioning, psychological research has found that teenagers in neighborhoods which are gentrifying are far more likely to engage in property damage. They feel their community is being taken from them and they have no control to change anything, so they tag buildings, break windows etc."
CommunismWorldwide,3a496s,danman1950,2,Wed Jun 17 13:10:52 2015 UTC,"why is that ghettos or poor areas of nyc etc have such dirty streets and buildings and why don't the poor clean it if they aren't lazy?   It's difficult to care about your environment and the others around you when society has turned it's back on you, and when you are shit on and pissed upon by the economic system. You don't have a stake in those slums, you don't own those buildings, thus you feel no sense of responsibility or much less a desire to make an effort. Other comrades might give you a better answer, but this is my interpretation of why they don't do anything.   how did revolutionary Catalonia maintain cleanliness?   Revolutionary Catalonia has several bodies in charge of sanitation:   The principles according to which these  experiments were conducted were inspired by anarchist theory. We need only point to the  democratic and self - managed aspect of the collectives; the General Assembly constituted  the “supreme organ of power”, the Administrative Council wa s elected and revocable; the  equality of all members, both with regard to rights as well as to duties, was total. In  general, rigid working hours were not imposed, but tasks were shared by groups of five  or ten persons. We should also mention the rationalization and increase of production, the  aid sent to the front through donations in kind — and in men! — etc. An equally important  aspect was the major social achievements of the agricultural collectives with regard to  education and sanitation. All accounts poin t to the establishment of new schools, literacy  or general educational programs for adults, new clinics and hospitals, libraries and  cultural centers.   And during war-time:   Establishment of revolutionary order in the rearguard, organization of forces that are at  least to some extent trained for the war, training of an officer corps, a school for  commun ications and signaling, provision of food and clothing, economic organization,  legislative and judicial initiatives; the Committee of Militias was everything, it attended  to everything, the conversion of peacetime industries into war industries, propaganda ,  relations with the Madrid Government, support for all battle fronts, diplomatic contact  with Morocco, cultivation of available land, health and sanitation, guarding the coasts  and the borders, a thousand things of the most disparate nature. We paid the m ilitiamen,  their families, the widows of the combatants, in a word, a few dozen individuals attended  to the tasks that, in a government, would require a costly bureaucracy. The Committee of  Militias was a Ministry of War during times of war, a Ministry of  the Interior an d a  Ministry of Foreign Affairs  at the same time, inspiring  the creation of  similar institutions  in the domains of economics and culture.   Source   Was mao's government, or the Chinese state during mao's time coercive in some way?   Oh sure. But then all governments are. The use of coercion is not in and of itself a bad thing. And even Anarchists agree with this:   If I'm taking a walk with my grandchildren and they dart out into a busy street, I will use not only authority but also physical coercion to stop them.The act should be challenged, but I think it can readily meet the challenge. And there are other cases; life is a complex affair, we understand very little about humans and society, and grand pronouncements are generally more a source of harm than of benefit. But the perspective is a valid one, I think, and can lead us quite along way.   -Noam Chomsky in Anarchism, Marxism & Hope for the Future.  A Marxist government like the one Mao ran before his death, had the task of dismantling private property, expropriating land, capital, industry and houses from the Capitalist class and putting these in the people's control. Force, under such conditions, is necessary in order to not only safeguard the revolution, but transition to a Socialist economic system.  As for your question on worker autonomy and the State being illegitimate, I'll let a more knowledgeable comrade take a crack at that question. Hope these answers helped though :3"
CommunismWorldwide,3a496s,sillandria,3,Wed Jun 17 15:03:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I seem to be spamming, I have a lot questions, but this is the last one for now: what's wrong with praxeology?"
CommunismWorldwide,3a496s,lovelybone93,5,Wed Jun 17 18:39:27 2015 UTC,"Praxeology was essentially created the same way black-box Skinnerism was. Skinner basically said ""We have no way to probe actual human thoughts right now, so let's pretend that behavior is the only thing that matters."" It was a functional concession due to technological limitations. Since then, we have developed better tools to determine what agents think and why, and thus we have more developed branches of psychology.  As to why Praxeology is like this, Mises basically decided that the function of human decisionmaking had to be assumed to be free of outside influence (not in the sense of providing structure for those thoughts, but that it was essentially ""free will""). We know this now not to be true-- lots of things influence us, including stuff like marketing, beyond both our conscious control and awareness. We're social animals, by nature-- reducing us down to individual agents literally cuts the cord from the reason societies and language develop. Praxeology does this.  It also plays some pretty silly word games. In Praxeology, any course of action is rational if it is deliberate and towards an end. In other words, he solves the problem of market irrationality by saying it's literally by definition not possible, without delving into the plethora of biases we as humans engage that fundamentally shift outcomes from intended goals. To give it a brief summary (and not the fairest treatment), Mises basic thesis is that humans seek to do things to make themselves better off, and trade makes both parties better off. Therefore, no combination or permutation of trades can fail to make everyone better off as a whole.  All of this comes to Praxeology's biggest problem: Its lack of concrete definitions. Mises often compared his ""science"" to math, which you can do sitting in an armchair and for which experimentation is useless. While that's true, the reason that's OK with math is that when we do apply maths to the real world, we do experiments to determine whether our set of assumptions in this case is applicable. We can't do that with Praxeology because unlike math, the terms he uses are not well defined. ""Rational"" barely passes muster as a discriminatory concept, ""Action"" is loosely defined, and ""Voluntary"" is perhaps the most counter-intuitively defined of all-- that is, if you fall down the stairs on accident and without someone doing it to you and receive injury, that was a voluntary action on your part.  This is a primer on the issues of its construction. All of the issues with its implementation would take a lot, lot longer, but they stem from fundamentally wrong assumptions about how humans work."
CommunismWorldwide,3a496s,craneomotor,2,Wed Jun 17 20:27:09 2015 UTC,"You're not spamming in the least. The more questions you ask, the more good information you can get and replace those questions with :3   praxeology   Do you mean Misesian and Ricardian praxeology? I'm afraid I don't know enough about it. Seems a question /u/Sillandria or comrade /u/ieattime20 might be better equipped to deal with. Except to say that the economic ""free trade"" arguments by comparative advantage that it makes are false because they're built on equally false premises, mainly these two:  One, that domestic factors of production like capital goods and skilled labour are not internationally mobile, and instead will be re-employed in the sector/sectors in which the country’s comparative advantage lies; and two, that workers are fungible, and will be re-trained easily and moved to the new sectors where comparative advantage lies. Source.   By the late 19th century assumption (1) was questionable.  Today it is also the case that both capital goods themselves and investment money for production are very mobile, so that (1) is also not true. Proposition (2) is also questionable in many cases (Prasch 1996: 40–41).  Once capital becomes extremely mobile internationally, we no longer have comparative advantage, but absolute advantage. It is not at all clear that free trade under “absolute advantage” is beneficial to all nations. In Ricardo’s day, internationally mobile capital was not that significant. David Ricardo observed that the immobility of capital in his day prevented capital from seeking absolute advantage. He described it as  “the difficulty with which capital moves from one country to another, to seek a more profitable employment, and the … [ease] with which it invariably passes from one province to another in the same country” (Ricardo, On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, 7.18).  In Ricardo’s day, capital mobility did not happen on a large scale because capital and technology were more difficult to transfer. But it never occurred to Ricardo that, in a world of mobile capital and easily transferable technology, capital would seek absolute advantage in a destructive way to its home country.   So simply put, ""the neoclassical argument for free trade is dependent on the capital of one country remaining in that country and being put to work in some other productive domestic industry, where comparative advantage lies. This is not what happens today, where capital from Western countries seeks absolute advantage in the developing countries.""  So returning to the original question, ""the hidden assumptions are as follows:    It does not matter what you produce (e.g., you could produce pottery), as long as you do it in a way that gives you comparative advantage; Technology is unchanging and uniform; and There are no returns to scale (Galbraith 2008: 68; Chang 2003: 292).    ""These hidden assumptions are utterly absurd. First, it does matter what you produce. Reliance on primary commodity exports whose prices are subject to volatility is not a successful strategy for economic development in most countries; in fact, such countries reliant on primary commodities and service industries are usually poor developing nations.""  You can read more about this in the source I provided."

I'm confused on why the people cried for kim jon il. One article states its korean Confucius tradition citing an similar event in south Korea in 1979, while another says it was a mix of tradition of immense cultural emotional expression and genuine sadness. So why did they cry? Are there other examples of this in Korean history?  The articles mentioned the penal system is different from the u.s., but they didn't seem to mention how it was different. What does the DPRK define as crime? How is the prison system organised and how does it function? What is the most common crime that people go to prison for? The article mentions work place democracy in agrarian communities. Does this also apply to industrial production as well? Is work voluntary? Can anyone choose any job they want?  So what role does the government play other than defending the country? Do they control distribution? Can the citizens make changes to the state structure and have they? Is the kim dynasty responsible for all the national decisions? Can any citizen become involved in the state apparatus?  A few of the articles mentioned the DPRK traded with other countries.

Take that article with a pinch of salt, the only thing unbiased about it is the bit about Park.  Consider the mass mourning that went on in the United States after FDR died, or JFK was murdered. These were figures the people genuinely loved and everywhere in the country there were was mass mourning and disillusionment. Maybe it wasn't as culturally open as it is in the Koreas, but it's not too outlandish when you consider that people, as far as we know, genuinely loved Kim Jong-Un, or at the very least (since we was the only leader some of them had ever known) felt like a great father-figure had been lost. Under such circumstances it's easier to understand.   What does the DPRK define as crime? How is the prison system organised and how does it function? What is the most common crime that people go to prison for?   I'm afraid I'm not an expert on the DPRK. Comrade /u/ComIntelligence was, but he doesn't have access to the Internet currently where he is. On the issue of the North Korean prison camps, there really isn't much information:   Fact-checking is not possible in North Korea. Outsiders have not visited its political prison camps. Accounts of what goes on inside them cannot be independently verified. Defectors remain the primary sources of information, and their motives and credibility are not spotless. In South Korea and elsewhere, they are often desperate to make a living, willing to confirm the preconceptions of human rights activists, anticommunist missionaries, and right-wing ideologues. Some camp survivors refuse to talk unless they are paid cash upfront. Others repeated juicy anecdotes they had heard but not personally witnessed. p10   This from Blaine Harden's book Escape from Camp 14, which talks about about Shin Dong-hyuk and other DPRK defectors.  If it is true that the conditions are this horrible, then of course we should criticise and oppose it heavily. Prison systems, camps and the like are not Socialist, they are methods of repression that any government might use. They have nothing to do with Socialism, the way that water and power are not inherently Socialist in nature, either.   The article mentions work place democracy in agrarian communities. Does this also apply to industrial production as well? Is work voluntary? Can anyone choose any job they want?  // So what role does the government play other than defending the country? Do they control distribution? Can the citizens make changes to the state structure and have they? Is the kim dynasty responsible for all the national decisions? Can any citizen become involved in the state apparatus? // Finally, how does the monetary system work? How does the payroll work?   An excellent questions, and one that you can find a lengthy historical answered too here. It'll go into detail about the historical collectivisation, instrialisation, the Taean work system and their constitution as well as current workings and the role the government plays. Here's an excerpt from that post:    The highest managerial authority under the Taean system is the party committee. Each committee consists of approximately twenty-five to thirty-five members elected from the ranks of managers, workers, engineers, and the leadership of working people's organizations at the factory. A smaller ""executive committee,"" about one-fourth the size of the regular committee, has practical responsibility for day-to-day plant operations and major factory decisions. The most important staff members, including the party committee secretary, factory manager, and chief engineer, make up its membership. The system focuses on cooperation among workers, technicians, and party functionaries at the factory level.   This system has persisted long in the DPRK. In his New Years address at the thirtieth anniversary of the Taean Work System, Kim Il-Sung said:   [The] Taean work system is the best system of economic management. It enables the producer masses to fulfill their responsibility and role as masters and to manage the economy in a scientific and rational manner by implementing the mass line in economic management, and by combining party leadership organically with administrative, economic, and technical guidance.   The DPRK's economy is a dual state-owned/cooperative economy, with workers in the latter constitutionally entitled to ownership of their workplaces. Taken from the Constitution of the DPRK:   Article 22  The property of social cooperative organizations belongs to the collective property of working people within the organizations concerned.  Social cooperative organizations can possess such property as land, agricultural machinery, ships, medium-small sized factories and enterprises.  The State shall protect the property of social cooperative organizations.    This post plus the link you'll find at the end there, will break down the exact workings of the Taean work system.   A few of the articles mentioned the DPRK traded with other countries. Does the DPRK sell goods on the capitalist market? Who gets the money returned and how is allocated?    Yes it has partnerships primarily with Russia and China, and it has what are called ""Special Economic Zones"", another reason for why we call the policies since Kim Il-Sung's death revisionist, because they make allowances for coexistence with Capitalist states. Remember that the DPRK was the Industrialised part of Korea before the split, and it still has many natural resources, many more rare metals, possibly six times as many, than even China. Coal, lead, tungsten, zinc, graphite, magnesite, iron ore, copper, gold, pyrites, salt, fluorspar, you name it.  If you're interest in reading a more generalised consolidation of criticisms against the propaganda levied on the DPRK, this Wiki page (and I don't generally use Wikipedia anymore since someone usually complains about it as a faulty source) has quite a few bits that debunk a lot of the crap that gets shoveled it's way."

Prompted by his politically-motivated ambition, he tried to increase his force and build his base for realizing it by implanting those who had been punished for their serious wrongs in the past period into ranks of officials of departments of the party central committee and units under them.  Jang and his followers did not sincerely accept the line and policies of the party, the organizational will of the WPK, but deliberately neglected their implementation, distorted them and openly played down the policies of the party. In the end, they made no scruple of perpetrating such counter-revolutionary acts as disobeying the order issued by the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army.  The Jang group weakened the party's guidance over judicial, prosecution and people's security bodies, bringing very harmful consequences to the work for protecting the social system, policies and people.  Such acts are nothing but counter-revolutionary, unpopular criminal acts of giving up the class struggle and paralyzing the function of popular democratic dictatorship, yielding to the offensive of the hostile forces to stifle the DPRK.  ....  By throwing the state financial management system into confusion and committing such act of treachery as selling off precious resources of the country at cheap prices, the group made it impossible to carry out the behests of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il on developing the industries of Juche iron, Juche fertilizer and Juche vinalon.  Affected by the capitalist way of living, Jang committed irregularities and corruption and led a dissolute and depraved life.  By abusing his power, he was engrossed in irregularities and corruption, had improper relations with several women and was wined and dined at back parlors of deluxe restaurants.  Ideologically sick and extremely idle and easy-going, he used drugs and squandered foreign currency at casinos while he was receiving medical treatment in a foreign country under the care of the party.  Jang and his followers committed criminal acts baffling imagination and they did tremendous harm to our party and revolution.  ....  The meeting adopted a decision of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee on relieving Jang of all posts, depriving him of all titles and expelling him and removing his name from the WPK.  The party served warning to Jang several times and dealt blows at him, watching his group's anti-party, counter-revolutionary factional acts as it has been aware of them from long ago. But it did not pay heed to it but went beyond tolerance limit. That was why the party eliminated Jang and purged his group, unable to remain an onlooker to its acts any longer, dealing telling blows at sectarian acts manifested within the party."

If you don't know, Starsuckers talks about how the effects of fame and media on society, and how those involved in media shape our society and how those involved in media rise to power.  I understand how celebrities rise to power and how they become apologists by participating in charities and etc. So what I don't understand is how stupid things like reality television and tabloids affects society and media, because this seems like something the documentary harps on a lot as reality television and tabloids have affects how journalism functions, so anyway, my question is how does reality television and celebrity worship, scandals, etc, affect society  and how have tabloids changed mainstream journalism?  Particularly what I find hard to believe is that reality television and celebrity worship is how it is harmful, because I know everyone says it's stupid as hell, yet reality television keeps rolling in money and everyone wants to meet there favorite actor and always say how they are such nice people and how good of an actor they are and so on, but, still same question, hows it harmful?"
CommunismWorldwide,3a496s,lovelybone93,3,Wed Jun 17 18:23:45 2015 UTC,"The prevalence of Reality Shows came about due to the 2008 writer's strike. Since there were no writers on staff networks had to scramble to put something on in order to keep customers and the easiest way to do so was through largely unscripted reality programing where ""ordinary"" people are shown doing ""ordinary"" things according to a loose structure that any moron could come up with on their lunch break. Now, one of the bigger issues of the 2008 strike was internet streaming. Writers didn't think that they were getting proper compensation from the revenue being garnered through internet sites, the Execute Producers told them to fuck themselves, and the writer's guild went on strike. You remember that South Park episode where Canada goes on strike and demands money from the internet? Yep, that was about the strike, with the shows creators (libertarians of the American variety) basically shitting on the union. Eventually, the writer's guild won some concessions, but television was changed forever and for the worst.  ""Television"" went two different ways: 1) the networks realized that reality shows are cheap to produce and aren't as likely to run into issues with the writer's guild and 2) the shitstorm lead to increased revenue for internet television, making it a profitable market, and encouraging investment. There is no unified television now. There is a split now between networks and internet streaming which are both competing for revenue and both attempting to reach different audiences. Networks exist mainly on cable and satellite, the old vanguard of television meaning that 1) those older folks that still own their old televisions are a target demographic and 2) poor folks that can't afford a computer are also a demographic. This means that networks have a terribly undefined demographic to work with, at least in the terms usually used to determine demographics. Plus, due to the likely low individual revenue, they have to appeal to as many people as possible. Thus enters the lowest common denominator: reality television.  Now reality television is simply entertainment noise: you can watch it, learn nothing, and still think your time was well spent. This is really good at keeping poor people occupied in the little time they do not work, and thus pacified. It also alters our perception of media since reality shows by their basic premise attempt to present ""ordinary"" people in ""ordinary"" situations without hardly ever ""breaking the fourth wall"" and allowing the viewers to see the affects that the show itself has on the framing of that ""reality"". In affect, reality shows are dangerous in that they erase the concept of the fourth wall entirely since they present the media distorted world as reality (a hyper-reality to use Baudrillard's terms) . Of course, many people have realized that reality television isn't ""real"" but the affect is still difficult to ignore since medium influence is very much a subtle approach: you can't enjoy reality television if you are constantly questioning its reality, so you suspend disbelief, but this suspension becomes second-nature and eventually invisible since there is just so much suspension involved in entertainment that it can break down your internal distinction between the real and the un-real. This allows media propaganda to pass unnoticed by those it is meant to affect which has disastrous affects on consumer society since it prevents people from ever realizing that they are trapped in a hyper-reality partly of their own creation, coerced of course through television and various other medium, but still the lotus-eater affect can not be ignored in that our greatest enemy toward salvation from consumerism is our own desires, warped though they may be."
CommunismWorldwide,3a496s,lovelybone93,2,Thu Jun 18 03:14:43 2015 UTC,"So do you mean fourth wall as in a direct interaction with the audience, or do you mean more of how fiction is a reflection of reality aka ""art imitates life""? I think maybe the word you are looking for that's better suited is the theme of a work, because reality t.v. doesn't really have anything to say or express (and if it does it's quick and it's a very generalized morality). Anyway, that's just semantics, but now I think I understand a bit more: it's dangerous because reality t.v. is a waste of time, but being only covered as a waste of time is what takes up the proles time, and thus, they get into the habit of wasting time and becoming passive, even so far that they may not have the desire and/or ability to question reality. And when you can't question, you can't think, and when you can't think, you just accept whatever conclusion comes to you. Ok, i hope I did't royally fuck up your meaning lol."
CommunismWorldwide,3a496s,lovelybone93,2,Thu Jun 18 03:52:29 2015 UTC,"I mean the fourth wall as the ""divide"" between the audience and the fiction. In the original sense in theater, the fourth wall is the missing wall that allows the audience to view the play. Any thing that recognized that the audience was a thing external to the fiction, like an actor directly addressing the audience, ""breaks the fourth wall"" by breaking the illusion between play and audience and, in a way, the line between reality and fiction. The fourth wall in reality television is much more complicated but can be understood by recognizing the ""story"" being put forward and the methods of producing the story, and audience at home that watches the final product. In plays the acting, stage, etc. are all used to produce the fiction, but are invisible to the audience, and the fourth wall divides the audience from the presentation of the fiction. In reality television it is the actors, the television crew, and the structured script that the actors go by. The reason why the fourth wall is erased is that there is no line between the audience, the actors, or the production. Reality stars talk directly to the camera, often other cameras can be seen in shot, audio mics are sometimes shown, hell in certain shows the crew themselves become part of the show (Dirty Jobs is an example). All of this masks the fundamentally fictional aspect of reality television, which still exists and may be paid lip service, but the fiction can become confused with reality very easily."
CommunismWorldwide,3a496s,lovelybone93,2,Thu Jun 18 04:03:54 2015 UTC,"how does reality television and celebrity worship, scandals, etc, affect society and how have tabloids changed mainstream journalism?   The best answer to that question is Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent.   How's it harmful?   A vast majority of Reality TV currently has a direct relationship with advertising and consumerism and it's a sink of resources that lends itself to an kind of neo-opiate of the masses. Contestants are forced to work for someone, or humiliate themselves, in exchange for the promise of monetary compensation which of course is a fraction of what the owners obtain through their exploitation. That alone, to me, is enough to wave it goodbye.  Still under a Socialist system there might be some reality, but likely because we'll no longer be running things for profit, it might take on a different guise. Maybe it can still focus on the drama of people's lives, though these will likely be interpersonal relationship issues than the woes brought about through economic deprivation."
CommunismWorldwide,3a496s,lovelybone93,2,Wed Jun 17 18:43:54 2015 UTC,"Comrade, I'm reading Kapital again (Marxists.org, since no physical copy is available), and if I get what he's saying correctly, that a commodity's value cannot be truly realized until the end product comes out in which all the congealed labor is baked in (surplus value).   So the commodity of iron wouldn't realize its exchange value (let's say a gun) until the finished product came out, correct? That the gun would be worth more, the longer it took the average time to create it or to mine the iron; less if it took less time to mine the iron or change it into a gun. Again, sorry for the 101 level questions."
CommunismWorldwide,3a496s,lovelybone93,2,Thu Jun 18 23:10:24 2015 UTC,"if I get what [Marx is] saying correctly, that a commodity's value cannot be truly realized until the end product comes out in which all the congealed labor is baked in (surplus value).  So the commodity of iron wouldn't realize its exchange value (let's say a gun) until the finished product came out, correct?   This is not what he means. To understand why, let's think about this in terms of the various perspectives in the overall capital relation.  What you described is more or less that of the laborer (who we today coyly refer to as the ""consumer"") being confronted with products that are exiting circulation as capital - i.e., being consumed as use-values outside of a capital circuit. These final products or consumer goods are indeed an aggregation of previous labor processes, and these products's values can be increased by an increase the value produced at any point in the chain of labor processes. But this is not the perspective given in Vol. 1, and this final act of consumption, while a realization of value for some capitalist, is not the only realization of value of that commodity. In fact, that final product most likely represents several different instances of value realization.   The perspective given in Vol. 1 is, broadly speaking, that of the individual capitalist, or altenatively one individual capital who the capitalist embodies. Questions of value, or the realization thereof, take place within the context of this individual capital and its ability to realize value from the results of its productive consumption of labor power, tools, and raw and auxiliary materials (which could be either commodities or services). Realization of value is then defined as ""the conversion of a profit or payment in the form of a surplus product or credit into money form.""  So the individual capitalist, in the normal course of things, is constantly realizing value as they make commodities, bring them to market, and return with cash in hand. She doesn't care one iota where that commodity is going or what use it will have. It could be going to a consumer, but it could just as well be a tool or material in some other capitalist's production process. In either case, our capitalist has realized her value - her commodity has departed from her, and in its place is money."
CommunismWorldwide,3a496s,lovelybone93,2,Fri Jun 19 13:52:52 2015 UTC,"So value is determined by the amount of labor that it took to create something or mine something, not just an end product, then.   So the raw iron ore in my particular situation would then be sold by the capitalist to the gun maker for less than the value the gun maker would sell the end product for, because it took less labor power/time to mine the iron than it did to mine it and transform it into a gun. But would still realize profit."
CommunismWorldwide,3a496s,jsmith18486,3,Fri Jun 19 21:49:08 2015 UTC,"The ore would sell for less value because the gun contains the value of both the processed ore and the value added by the gun-maker.  For example:  Let's say mining and processing 1 lb. of ore requires 6 hours of simple labor time.  Let's say transforming 1 lb. of ore into a gun takes 3 hours of simple labor time.  Thus the labor time entailed in the production of the ore is 6 hours.  The labor time entailed in the production of the gun is 9 hours - 6 hours of ""dead"" labor in the processed ore + 3 hours of ""living"" labor to make the gun.  Both the iron miner and the gun-maker will make a profit, but the value embodied in the gun is greater because it embodies the value of both the mining and the gun-making."

CommunismWorldwide,3a496s,lovelybone93,3,Tue Jun 23 07:06:28 2015 UTC,"The immediate questions to ask would have to be, what is a merit, what benefits does it grant and who decides? This sums up the immediate problems with meritocracy.  Meritocracy, in one shape or another, has had many proponents throughout history. From Aristotle, through John Stuart Mill, to present day capitalist apologists and others. Studying these cases, it is easy to distinguish that in each time period or ideology, the notion of a ""merit"" has taken on rather dubious forms. From pro-slavery philosopher kings, through votes-according-to-education schemes, to explanations of money and political power (or outcomes in schools) as justified by merit in present day society.  But the self-generating role of money as capital, the elitist, exclusionary and propaganda-filled realm of education, and the rejection of any inherent justification for one person wielding more political power than another tell us that these appeals to merits have rarely held up to a closer inspection. Instead, in each instance, these seem to be attempts to naturalize certain attributes of a certain group as being of greater importance, thus establishing a basis for what could actually become a class society in itself.  Practical difficulties of meritocracy aside, even a theoretical notion of meritocracy can run into problems depending on the context. Pure meritocracy would for instance dictate that better study results should yield better grades, which in turn should allow someone access to a better school – or some other privilege, otherwise the grades are meaningless. But this is nothing else than a further privilege, given on the basis of prior privilege, which doesn't sound well if one holds egalitarian ideals high. Thus even in theory it is hard to distinguish meritocracy from a sort of aristocracy of the merited.  Communist societies should be based on needs (the definition of which is also important, but falls outside of this scope), not merits, and at least from an anarchist communist perspective, what is today considered a position of power and/or privilege, can only legitimately be held as a mandate from ones peers, for instance as a directly recallable delegate. Thus the only merit possible is the trust and recognition of the people involved in a particular social context, which leads to a position not of privilege or power, but of reciprocity, cooperation and mutual aid."

CommunismWorldwide,3a496s,MasCapital,2,Wed Jun 17 19:40:23 2015 UTC,"You can start by telling them that no matter how much bullshit is lain at Stalin's feet, he wasn't omnipotent or omniscient. Many of the purges were led by Nikolai Yezhov and his faction of bureaucrats (who ironically was purged himself).  Stalin attempted democratic reforms, pushed for a new and more equitable constitution and wanted to curb and limit the power of the rising bureaucracy. You can look at the bibliographical citation and annotations on that source, it's thick as heck.  Stalin himself asked to step down on four separate times and each time his attempts were denied.  None of this means Stalin doesn't share responsability, but no more or less than say Obama does for the drone strikes. There are many generals, bureaucrats, politicians, analyists and soldiers/assassins on the ground who share equal parts that same burden of guilt. Likely Stalin just signed his name on stuff, trusting that his people knew what they were doing. But he didn't specifically and personally have a naughty and nice list and write people off on the list like some kind of old school Light Yagami in his Death Note.  There's a transcript of Yehzov's confession here.  This additional article shows that it was, as I've come to understand it, a great many people who decided on the purges and such:   When Lavrentii Beria was appointed as Ezhov's second-in-command Ezhov and his men understood that Stalin and the Party leadership no longer trusted them. They made one last plot to assassinate Stalin at the November 7, 1938 celebration of the 21st anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. But Ezhov's men were arrested in time.  Ezhov was persuaded to resign. An intensive investigation was begun and a huge number of NKVD abuses were uncovered. A great many cases of those tried or punished under Ezhov were reviewed. Over 100,000 people were released from prison and camps. Many NKVD men were arrested, confessed to torturing innocent people, tried and executed. Many more NKVD men were sentenced to prison or dismissed.  Under Beria the number of executions in 1938 and 1940 dropped to less than 1% of the number under Ezhov in 1937 and 1938, and many of those executed were NKVD men, including Ezhov himself, who were found guilty of massive unjustified repression and executions of innocent people.   The bit in bold shows that there were MANY officers, middle-ranking and high-ranking, who doubt had their own reasons for sentencing this or that person. So this was handled more like a decentralised, ""everyone put a name on the list you don't like and we'll make the boss sign it"" type of deal. Horrendous, yes, but not singularly orchestrated by Stalin. Yhezov was scapegoated, to an extent as well, but as the attack dog of Stalin's various First Secretaries, he was saddled with the historical black mark.  Anyway, also keep in mind that a massive nation like Russia, and subsequently the other Socialist States, all to be controlled by a central authority necessitated an inordinate amount of functionaries and bureaucrats. Dozens of secretaries and red tape. Under such conditions, who knows what kind of abuses were made."

But by far the biggest reason for the distortions and lies about Stalin stems from the fact that the USSR under Stalin’s leadership was a major threat to capital. Stalin and the rest of the Communist Party took the theoretical construct of socialism and made it into concrete reality. Stalin is hated not because he failed, or because the USSR in his day was a catastrophe; Stalin is hated because he succeeded. He proved that we can build a society that functions and provides for the needs of its people without the rule of capital. The profundity of this should not be underestimated, and it should come as little surprise that the bourgeoisie has for decades made every effort to discredit the achievements of the Soviet Union, especially those made by Stalin. The reason for this is that if we realize the truth, then suddenly, socialism seems like not such an unrealistic thing. Suddenly, socialism appears as something that can be achieved and has been, with a rich history of success and failure to learn from. In short, if we embrace the experiences of really-existing socialism rather than disavow them, then we are empowered to build a clear vision of a better world, and a plan for how to get there.

Their positions on a lot of issues are indeed awesome, and it's great seeing women and ethnic minorities (who were traditionally kind of ignored by the Pakistani left) joining the party. Problem is, right now they don't have nearly the critical mass needed to do the things the left is doing in Europe. It's definitely an uphill battle.

CommunismWorldwide,39zsxu,SolidBlues,5,Tue Jun 16 02:55:48 2015 UTC,"I've heard many Marxists describe voting as legitimizing the system- as the article says, ""The more that we take part the more they can claim that they have a mandate to rule"". Capitalism doesn't need a mandate, however, and will claim one regardless of whether or not we vote (43% eligible voter turnout couldn't possibly be described as a mandate, and yet they do nonetheless). I agree that voting is one of the lowest forms of political engagement, but I just don't see the materialists analysis in this 'don't legitimize' strategy. It seems both prefigurative and idealistic."
CommunismWorldwide,39zsxu,denversocialist,4,Tue Jun 16 13:46:45 2015 UTC,"For the ruling class to rule, it has to present its interests as the interest of all society. Further, participating in elections ties the workers to the parliamentary process, i.e. it makes them believe they can effect change by voting. Not-voting reverses both of these facts.  First, it sends a message to the bourgeoisie that the working class no longer accepts that our interests are the same. Second, it forces the workers to find their own methods of struggle against the capitalist system outside of capitalistic structures."

It's possible to be working to create a new system while simultaneously working on improving the one that you hope to replace.

ANY HIGHER FINE is not over x € but instead you are sentenced to x days. They take your average income over the last 6 months, and thus determine your earning per day, and that is how much you have to pay for every day of your sentence.That way fines are really fair&equal for everybody !    I bet, when they suddenly have to pay 20.000$, since they where sentenced to 20 days, and have an average daily income of 1000$, even they will think twice Wink It really works like a charm, and especially poor people, do not have the usual, unfair disadvantage through fines. If you don't or can't pay the fine, you go to jail, for the amount of days, which you where sentenced to. A fair and simple system, basically, only for really small fines (anything so small, that it does not involve any judge), it is not implemented, since it is way too complicated, to determine daily earnings). The maximum penalty is 6 months, over that, you go to jail."

CommunismWorldwide,39nc1g,Adahn5,3,Sat Jun 13 18:15:25 2015 UTC,"Aye. I was playing this hentai game based on the Harry Potter series, and I expected it to be lascivious and dirty (obviously!). I thought it was going to be along the lines of you're a student who goes to Hogwarts and you go to class, flirt with other students and do things that advance the relationship status this way or that way until you get to the point where you bang.  However it wasn't like this. Rather it was entirely structured around humiliating a perticular female student. You're cast in the role of the head master and subsequently make her perform sexual favours in exchange for points to her House, and engage in more forceful, coersive measures to extract these degrading favours. It skirts the line of consent, outright embraces the imbalance of power relation between someone in position of authority and someone that is completely powerless, and in fact depends upon the conditional state of their education, and in turn violate them and degrade them in various ways.  The acts in and of themselves are no problem. If someone enjoys and gives you the thumbs up to spitting in their mouth, go for it. If you enjoy being dominated and set up a safe word so that you retain your ability to pull away your consent, have at it! But what essentially amounts to rape after someone is screaming to stop and your only response in the game is to say ""shut up whore, I'm about to cum"", is enough to make you hit the X tab and sigh in disappointment.  Sure, it's a game, it's a fantasy, no one is getting hurt or what have you. But I don't know, it's just like watching rape on television or something. It reinforces the notion that women have no say in what's done to them, that they're just sex toys to be terrorised and made to submit.  Edit: Additionally, it seems most of these types of games always put you, the male protagonist, in a position of power of some kind. You're either larger and stronger and thus capable of enforcing your will through violence, or you're a master and the woman in question is already your slave. Or you're a boss and she's the employee, or some other unequal power dynamic. In some ways it's actually insulting to think that you, as a man, can not find a consentual relationship through your own intelligence, charm, ability and capacity, but rather that any sexual intercourse you ever engage in is directly linked to your ability to force your will onto others."
CommunismWorldwide,39nc1g,lovelybone93,3,Sat Jun 13 19:09:29 2015 UTC,"Jeez, that's a drag, I'm into kink, but not coercion, that's a game glorifying rape. I'm into consensual non-consent/meta-consent sometimes (please don't gulag me!), but they never show the whole scene before a bdsm scene takes place, nor do they show the aftercare and cuddles.  It's so shitty to have the male protagonists in porn and other adult themed media portrayed as people in power that use that power to get laid because they have no social skills, but a 6-pack, a full head of hair, and a 17-inch cock, because a big penis apparently makes up for being a big dick."

CommunismWorldwide,39nc1g,lovelybone93,3,Sat Jun 13 20:22:25 2015 UTC,"No, I haven't read that article, but I have noticed that in porn, guys are pretty much disembodied penises.   We cater to guys in porn, you have every kind of woman under the sun in porn, but not women, all the guys in porn are pretty much the same; well-endowed, full head of hair, hairless body, athletic.   What if a woman likes an average guy, a hairy guy, has a average penis, or a bald guy? No luck for them in porn."

CommunismWorldwide,39nc1g,lovelybone93,3,Sat Jun 13 20:48:15 2015 UTC,"True, but most people don't consume porn via VHS or hard media anymore, so 80's/early 90's porn is mostly lost.   I've seen some porn from the 80's, and while the video quality clearly isn't as good as today's, they tend to have slightly better stories, what passes for plots in porn.   Like Taboo with Kay Parker deals with a subject matter that is abhorrent to most of humanity, it's still a better plot than let's say Horny Housewives 37, ""the film where housewives fuck the mailman just because, 3 hours of random people fucking housewives!"" or another title."
CommunismWorldwide,39nc1g,Adahn5,3,Sat Jun 13 20:55:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah the Gonzo stuff gets old. But I think that's also because we don't really give porn time anymore. It used to be that you'd have a a story, actual entertainment, followed by fucking, then the conclusion. Today two minutes in you have a penis doing something to a vulva, and then lots of copious amounts of semen flying everywhere.  The other reason for why there's no in-between, if you ask me, is because any movie that has any kind of romance in it is going to also have a softcore porn scene.  PS. It might also be that we're just not that patient any longer. We're busy, we got shit to do. Who the hell has 90 minutes for porn?"

Minecraft is probably the most communist-friendly game there is, although, it depends on who you play it with. Grand theft auto 5 is one of my favorite games to play, but it is capitalist and sexist as hell.  Not only does the gameplay function in a capitalist mode, but it can even be affected by real life capitalism when players use xbox points to buy GTA money.

CommunismWorldwide,38zyk2,lovelybone93,2,Sat Jun 13 00:52:29 2015 UTC,"All right so I did some research and it turns out, the Soviet Union ""started out"" as State Capitalist, according to Lenin himself:   State capitalism would be a step forward as compared with the present state of affairs in our Soviet Republic. If in approximately six months’ time state capitalism became established in our Republic, this would be a great success and a sure guarantee that within a year socialism will have gained a permanently firm hold and will have become invincible in this country.   Source.   The state capitalism, which is one of the principal aspects of the New Economic Policy, is, under Soviet power, a form of capitalism that is deliberately permitted and restricted by the working class. Our state capitalism differs essentially from the state capitalism in countries that have bourgeois governments in that the state with us is represented not by the bourgeoisie, but by the proletariat, who has succeeded in winning the full confidence of the peasantry. Unfortunately, the introduction of state capitalism with us is not proceeding as quickly as we would like it. For example, so far we have not had a single important concession, and without foreign capital to help develop our economy, the latter’s quick rehabilitation is inconceivable.   Source.  So as Dr. Wolff says -here- this was a good thing. It was a natural step. Now we have the State, and we can control this and that. So we must begin the process of implementing Socialism to build toward Communism. Then Lenin dies and Stalin declares that what we now have is Socialism.  That's where Trotskyst theories of Degenerate, Deformed worker's states, and State Capitalism come into play. From comrade kc_socialist:   A degenerated workers' state is a state in which the bourgeoisie has been overthrown and expropriated, yet a bureaucratic caste (or coordinator class in Anarchist terms) has arisen as a reflection of various different factors. Where once the working class directly controlled and participated in the operation of the state and production, now a bureaucracy functions as almost an intermediary force in society expressing its own interests and acting as a break on the realization of socialist production and distribution. The classic example is the U.S.S.R.  A deformed workers' state is a state in which the working class never held direct political or economic power, yet also operates under a non-capitalist mode of production. The classic historical examples for this are usually the Eastern European ""people's democracies"".  State capitalism is a theory that suggests that the presence of wages, scientific management of labor, lack of participatory control over production, the law of value etc. invalidates any claims to socialism that a state may have purely based on its property relations. People like Tony Cliff and C.L.R. James (later in life) created and developed this theory.   I would agree that the Soviet Union exhibited elements of State Capitalism (without the conclusion that the theory reaches, at least per-Kruschev, because they were still building Socialism. But it was primarily, as was states, a Degenerate Worker's State.  Other examples of these transformations or amalgamations Degenerate Worker's State and State Capitalism would be China, Vietnam, and Laos too.  As for War Communism and the NEP, both were implemented by Lenin to suit the specific circumstances of Russia. The first was an emergency measure because, as we all know, not only were they facing famine after WWI, but also they had to put down the counter-revolutionary forces of the White Army, and subsequently invasions from various Allied nations who supported the Tsar's restoration to power. So the Revolution, Civil War, repelling Invasion Forces, all of this made War Communism necessary.  As for the NEP, that's part of the State Capitalism thing we talked about. You can read about it here. Like Dr. Wolff said in that video, after the revolution the problem becomes ""what the fuck do we do?"" You need to get things started again, get things rolling along. You need to tell people ""please, you need to get back to work so we can produce again. So we can have food on the table, so that our toilets flush, so that we can pump gas into our cars and garbage is picked up.""  Facing the complete upheval of the economic mode of production, especially in the countryside, the NEP was temporary step back in order to make two steps forward. The horrible conditions the Bolsheviks inherited showed you that it isn't possible to immediately transform every aspect of the economic base of a society and fundamentally change relations that previously existed under dire conditions (war, famine, invasion).  And like Dr. Wolff explains in here, much of what communists of that era did — with no practical experience/knowledge to speak of in terms of how a socialist revolution would really be able to transform society — was make use of what they knew: the Capitalist mode of production, but with some differences and justifications.  Anyway, we can be harsh but we have to keep in mind that Lenin, Trotsky, etc to a very real extent were breaking new ground, and it follows that they naturally made many mistakes and had to be harsh with war communism, and had to come up with something like the NEP as a bit of a fix to stabilize things and approach the problem later when they had some more breathing room. That's what Wolff says in that video, to a degree.  The problem, and we were should hold their feet to the fire, is that once the Soviet Union did stabilize, I'm talking after WWII, why didn't they implement Socialism in a more systematic, deliberate way. The question falls off the radar once Khrushchev comes to power of course, and the ""building of Socialism"" pretty much stops and settles into permanent State Capitalism. But I would blame Stalin, to an extent, for having provided the excuse of ""this is Socialism"" rather than call it, as Lenin did, for what it was. Because revisionists like Khrushchev could indeed later claim, thanks to Stalin, that what they had was Socialism when it indeed was not.  Anyway Bones I hope all this helps :3"
CommunismWorldwide,38zyk2,lovelybone93,2,Sat Jun 13 18:58:42 2015 UTC,"So originally, state capitalism was a good thing since it was controlled by the workers because they couldn't comprehend another mode of production, but it was okay because the workers controlled it. It allowed things to stabilize, while working towards socialism, is what Lenin intended.   Where it degenerates is when Stalin declared that state capitalism was socialism, and nothing to say of Khrushchev and his fucking corn.  I consider myself a Marxist-Leninist-Trotskyist (the icepicks, they hurt!) or more of a council communist, so whilst state capitalism can be good for getting things normalized, then we need to start to plan a socialized economy. And under a socialized economy things wouldn't be produced for profit, they'd be produced to fill a need, everyone would labor as best they can to fill the needs, once the needs are fulfilled, they can then enjoy their time as they please.  Thanks, comrade and apologies for the long-winded reply."
CommunismWorldwide,38zyk2,geckos100,2,Sat Jun 13 19:39:00 2015 UTC,"Aye. The thing to really keep in mind is that it's the ""majority"" of the economy that needs to be Socialist. As in, individual enterprises need to be controlled by the employees that work there. That's the best way to democratise the economy. State Capitalism serves as a swift way of providing an end to the ""terreur"" after the Revolution, but if the means of production are not in the hands of the workers, it's not Socialism.  The Soviet Union ""deformed"" because the workers did not control their work places. The fundamental relationship between themselves and the means of production remained exactly the same. They still had no say in what to produce, where to produce, how to produce, or what to do with the profits.  The government decided, and turned into the a single, bigass Super Boss. Now was he a nice superboss that gave lots of benefits and what not? Sure... but that doesn't make it Socialism x3 Anyway, as a Trotskyist, you might find this summary of their relationships with MLs, and of what they stand for, interesting."
CommunismWorldwide,38zyk2,geckos100,2,Sat Jun 13 19:51:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly, the workers, the people themselves must control everything, not the state as a superboss replacing the old bourgeoisie with a new one.

The Moskvitch was the easiest one you could get, but no one wanted it because it was ugly. Whilst the Reguli, which was better because it was reliable, wouldn't stall if it was covered in ten feet of snow and looked nicer (looked a little like a Fiat), would have a very long waiting period (between 6-18 months). The Volga was used primarily by Taxis and the Niva which was also very good, and was a 4x4 had an equally long waiting list because it was primarily used for export. Two of the countries that bought a lot of Soviet cars were Ireland and Cuba.  There was also the Chaika but this was was hard to get and primarily used by party functionaries. and you would pay it through your Worker's Union or the cooperative in which you worked. So if you worked in a chocolate factory, the 20 workers who were on the list for a car, and the Union payed for the cars.

CommunismWorldwide,38wu29,toaster_slayer,5,Mon Jun 8 04:19:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah... The Soviet Union was never ""Communist"". Communism is a Stateless, Classless, Moneyless socio-economic system. The Soviet Union started out as Marxist-Leninist, and after Khrushchev wasn't even that as it delved into revisionism. No self-respecting Socialist would claim the Soviet Union was anything more than State Capitalist after that.  The Imperialism you're seeing here is on the part of Saudi Arabia, but the US support of it is equally imperialist as it supports it's own economic interests in providing stability in the oil market. Both countries' monopoly over the Petrodollar relationship makes it so that they're essentially tied at the hip in this venture."
CommunismWorldwide,38wu29,toaster_slayer,-1,Mon Jun 8 04:25:20 2015 UTC,"Alright, the Soviet Union wasn't truly communist, but that still doesn't explain how a communist society is anti-imperialist.  Take for example the US support of the bombings. If the US has its own interests at heart, it would support a stable oil market (meaning a stable supply of oil). Whether it is communist or capitalist doesn't change that interest. Therefore the US would have supported the imperialist Saudis no matter what economic system it had."
CommunismWorldwide,38wu29,toaster_slayer,5,Mon Jun 8 04:36:15 2015 UTC,"Alright, the Soviet Union wasn't truly communist, but that still doesn't explain how a communist society is anti-imperialist.   Because Imperialism is the final stage of Capitalism as it seeks to expand into new markets, acquire resources and take territory through military conquest. A Communist society because it isn't a Capitalist one, and is no longer driven by the persuit of exchange value through a market system of distribution, nor presuposes an infinite amount of resources as Capitalism does, has neither purpose nor incentive to go out and exploit or oppress foreign nations.  Not to mention the fact that Communism is not a 'one country' thing. It's a global shift of economic system that carries with it the abolition of wage labour, money, and the market system of distribution in favour of planning and a gift economy. It doesn't seek to enrich itself with military conquest and expropriation of raw materiel.   If the US has its own interests at heart, it would support a stable oil market (meaning a stable supply of oil). Whether it is communist or capitalist doesn't change that interest.   Yes... it does. Capitalism seeks stability or instability depending on whether the Capitalist interests it has at heart are labour intensive with a specific necessity for oil, or Capital-intensive with a stake in oil shares on the stock market. Also the reason the United States has a vested interest in supporting Saudi Arabia, is again because of the Petrodollar relationship.  You do understand what that is, yes? No one in the world is allowed to simply buy oil with their own money. They're forced to first buy dollars with which to then buy the oil. That's the exclusive relationship Saudi Arabia and the United States have had for quite a while now.  Just to make your hypothetical work here, let's say, again for argument sake, that there were a ""Communist"" player out there. More than likely, because it isn't being driven by the private interests of car companies, plastic refining companies, food industries and oil refiners, it would already have funded projects for free, renewable energy rather than continue extracting and burning fossil fuels.  The United States isn't doing what it's doing because it's good for it's people, it's doing what it's doing because it's good for its Capitalist interests, the corporate powers, the millionaires and billionaires who make a killing out of the oil trade."
CommunismWorldwide,38wu29,Potss,-1,Mon Jun 8 04:49:49 2015 UTC,"I type slowly, sorry   Imperialism is the final stage of Capitalism as it seeks to expand into new markets   There is no reason for why a communist society would not try and expand in the same way that a capitalist society would. A new market means two things: more buyers (this is what you are focusing on) and more sellers (you seem to forget this part). In order for a market to form, there needs to be an exchange of resources or goods. If a communist society has a low amount of a certain good or resource, there is no reason for why they would not establish a market elsewhere in order to try and trade for that scarce good. However, by your definition, this is imperialism because that would be expanding into a new market.   Capitalism seeks stability or instability depending on whether the Capitalist interests it has at heart are labour intensive with a specific necessity for oil, or Capital-intensive.....   Have you heard of the phrase ""creative destruction""? The idea is that in order to allow for innovation and new technology, something much be destroyed. For example, the invention of the home computer destroyed the typewriter industry, but people were left with a better product so they were happier. Instability is not always a bad thing.    Communist countries love the environment   This is completely unrelated to our discussion, but has several issues as well. But I'd argue that the increased price of oil (your argument about the petrodollar) actually decreases the demand for oil and by extension increases the demand for greener products."

State-owned (public) banks have been operating successfully around the globe for many decades with no negative affects and zillions of positive benefits for their local communities/economies.  China has just such a bank that creates and issues it's own money and look at their economy. They simply borrow off themselves and pay themselves back at extremely low interest rates. This money is then re-injected into their economy.  Private banks do just a thing now but with a negative affect on our economies: They create credit out of nothing and then glean trillions from us and our governments on interest charges. Therein, the huge profits these banks make go to the private shareholders of these private banks, all at our expense. How much better that these profits go back to the state/community?  The Bank of North Dakota is shining example of public banking in the US - the home of privatisation and neoliberal capitalism. Indeed, so successful has BND been since it was formed in 1919 that other states in the US are now looking at establishing their own.  All governments around the world could create their own credit if they weren't in bed with the private bankers. Think of the possibilities - amazingly well funded and modern infrastructure, community facilities, education, hospitals, public transport... the list of positives go on and on.  Liberland could become a shining light in the realm of public banking by showing how such a thing is possible for an emerging economy.   Also they support slavery!

I think Caitlyn Jenner going public as trans will bring up a lot of similar arguments, and it is our job to say that we fully support her transition - not that we don't think it's bad, but that we support it, as well as the transitions of all trans people. If we remain silent, transphobes will think we agree with them due to the bystander effect.

CommunismWorldwide,38lpe4,Adahn5,4,Fri Jun 5 16:39:07 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about how we—all of us—manage or will manage to find meaningful relationships with prospective romantic partners.  I don't mean it quite literally, we all have the capacity to hook up after all. I mean more on a level of political and philosophical compatibility. This is a topic that often comes up in r/FemmeThoughts, with people searching for a partner (in general the person being sought is a man) who holds the same Feminist principles as they do. For us, of course, it's a matter of Socialism/Communism.  I'm sure none of us would be too picky if our prospective partner (or partners for those into polyamory) were of Anarchist or Marxist kind, but would be if that partner were say Liberal beyond hope, or worse.  What do you do, or what have you done, or what will you do if this prospective, or current partner does not hold these same views as you? Politics (and Religion as well) is, after all, one of those things that is an extension of your own morality, ethics and philosophy. It colours the way you see the world, the way you interpret it and how you behave and relate to the systems that hold us as well as the people that surround us.   Also, and on a more personal and separate note I had wanted to start my Master's immediately this June, but the application, examination and review process took longer than expected and so I'm going to have to wait until July and the ""Summer II"" period to start. It's irritating but what can you do?"

Julie, my co-writer, was telling me that getting to know me has spoiled most guys for her because now she can't like guys who aren't Feminists. She's also often said that I'm more of a Feminist than she is, and have subsequently made her more of one also.  She was the kind of Feminist that would say ""Yeah Feminism!"" and when asked ""Oh so have you read a lot of Judith Butler, Bell Hooks, and—"" She's start fidgeting.  In any event, it's sort of funny because I used to be a real douchebag when I was a teenager. I used to say the same kind of reactionary, sexist shit that all of the little privileged gamer gater shitheads say today. Which sort of makes me hopeful that they'll grow out of it as I did, but anyway I went on a tangent and I can't recall what we were talking about.  Oh yeah xD The fact that it's hard to find a partner. The problem is doubly troubling for women androphiles, I suspect, since finding a woman who's a feminist must be at least a little bit easier than finding a man who identifies as one.  As far as finding a Communist/Socialist/Anarchist partner, though, it's been my experience that women are generally more open-minded about it.

Sometimes, however, it can also manifest itself through other currents like Third Worldism, which sees everyone in the Global North as Labour Aristocrats and the Global South as the only exploited Proletariat.

CommunismWorldwide,38ic62,PandaSymposium,2,Thu Jun 4 14:58:32 2015 UTC,"But also they're ideologically inconsistent. If you're an Anarchist, and your analysis hinges on identifying and destroying unjust hirarchical systems of oppression such as racism (hierarchy based on race), capitalism (hierarchy based on class), and so on, then Patriarchy (hierarchy based on something as artificial as gender) should of course be smashed. But Manarchists deny it's existence or acknowledge it's existence but are okay with it.  As for Brocialists, it's similar. If as Marxists they understand the development of modern society through a historical, dialectical and materialist analysis, then it follows that they would see the roots of Patriarchy in the early division of labour and that structural discrimination against women helps Capitalism. They would further understand the role that domestic work plays in sustaining and maintaining the Capitalist mode of production. But again they either dismiss it as unimportant or otherwise nonexistent; despite the fact that things like race and gender are ""class in drag""."

As we witness the denouement of capitalism and the disintegration of globalism, Karl Marx is vindicated as capitalism's most prescient and important critic.

CommunismWorldwide,383702,lovelybone93,2,Tue Jun 2 06:09:20 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Feudalism, in fact, affects more the internal dealings of Capitalists than it does the Capitalist-Worker dichotomy. Think about Franchises, for instance. You as a franchisee pay Corporate for the use of their logos, their ""proprietary"" goods and manner of service, and they supply you with the things you need; in exchange you pay them a portion of your profits. You're the owner of the franchise but you owe fealty to the corporate lord. How's that different from the vassal Count who owes fealty to his King and pays him a portion of his wealth every so often? Meanwhile the peasants work in said franchises and are made to sign non-compete agreements whereby they can't work in any field closely resembling the one they were in, the way the peasants worked the land and were bonded to it for life."

But at the very least on an individual level, people who don't conform to the expectations of hetero norms face an uphill battle. This seems like a pretty obvious fact...

From my readings I tend to lean heavily toward Lenin, Trotsky, and Luxemburg despite all their disagreements, so it makes no sense for me to call myself one over another. Just my two cents."
CommunismWorldwide,37s29c,Adahn5,2,Sat May 30 21:16:53 2015 UTC,Same here comrade. I call myself a Communist and leave it at that because I see the genuine good in both Marxists as well as Anarchists. There are unquestionably good and reasonable points made by the likes of Kropotkin and Bakunin as are made by Lenin and Gramsci. To dismiss one over the other seems fruitless.  So yes it's why I invented the little Pragmatist Communist flair :3
CommunismWorldwide,37s29c,WeAreWatchingYouScum,2,Sat May 30 18:21:07 2015 UTC,"Huh, didn't see that flair until you mentioned it. Out of curiosity, what does your flair ""The Communist Harlequin"" mean, just a joke or something else?"
CommunismWorldwide,37s29c,Adahn5,2,Sat May 30 23:13:43 2015 UTC,"Ha x3 A while ago I made a joke that because of my non-committal nature to either Marxism-Leninism or Anarchism, that I was like a Harlequin, singing both praises and dancing from one side to the other, pulling each with rope so that all may gain hope and fight united for the Revolution. I think I might have written a limerick about it. This visual may help :3.  At the time I was making little graphics for everyone. See this one for /u/Capn_Blackbeard. This one for /u/The_Mermaid.

CommunismWorldwide,37s29c,lovelybone93,2,Sun May 31 06:55:49 2015 UTC,"Well i have one question right now.. So i have gotten confused with the difference of socialism and communism, and no not social democrats. Arent they both just communists?  This website is probably 80% wrong but it made me really confused, check it out. http://www.diffen.com/difference/Communism_vs_Socialism I'm not really trusting it."
CommunismWorldwide,37s29c,Adahn5,3,Sat May 30 23:18:10 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not comrade Adahn, nor an expert on communism, but I'll see if I can't clear things up for you.  Socialism is the lower form of communism, in that there's still a state and money, but the means of production and government are under democratic control, where things aren't made for profit. The reason money may still be used under socialism is for exchanges of goods and services in a well-known medium. Communism cannot be realized until socialism is achieved the world over.  Communism, when socialism is achieved worldwide is when the means of production globally are in the hands of the proletariat. Then we can truly have the dictatorship of the proletariat, in that there will be no more borders, countries, money (though non-transferable labor vouchers can be used) or classes.  E: fixed something."
CommunismWorldwide,37s29c,lovelybone93,1 point,Sat May 30 23:25:25 2015 UTC,"Arent they both just communists?   Yeah that website is meh. There's some okay definitions in there, now that I've taken the time to read through it, but there's some weird things that it doesn't seem to clear up or say where they came from, like this for example about Socialism:   Emphasis on profit being distributed among the society or workforce to complement individual wages/salaries.   For Marxists Socialism is ""lower order Communism"", or if you prefer, the first stage after Capitalism for us to begin building Communism. It's when the workers democratically control the means of production. Socialism can still have markets, exchange value, a State, money and quite possible you might still have wage labour.  Communism, on the other hand, is a stateless, classless, moneyless socio-economic system in which the means of production are controlled collectively by the whole of society and goods and services are produced in order to fulfill the social need rather than for exchange value and wage labour is abolished.  This means no more markets, but planning, and no more money but rather a gift economy.  Anarchists want Communism directly after the revolution, contrary to Marxists who believe a transitional period of State Socialism is necessary first.  Since we all want the same thing in the end, we're all commies >:3 We just disagree on how to get there, essentially. But we're all pulling in the same direction."

A degree ain't worth the paper it's printed on. What matters is what you learn where you go, and if you have an open mind, and how much studying you do on your own. I mean look at /u/Sillandria.

Since I carried my little Red Book with me, and he was such a nice fellow—really seemed to take to heart the criticisms I threw his way, I gave it to him.

CommunismWorldwide,37s29c,Adahn5,3,Mon Jun 1 03:57:40 2015 UTC,"Something I just realized (don't think its a unique thought but w/e):  Communists can respond to invocations of the free rider problem by noting that communism curbs unchecked greed by distributing based on need (which means meeting everyone's needs first, not just on an individual level) and disrespecting private property (thus preventing absenteeism)."

It's not like I do anything else, I'm actually a master at just doing nothing. I live in my own mind.  I actually timed an average day for me, something like 15 hours of just doing nothing a day, with maybe 20 minutes of meaningful social interaction if I'm lucky. Every day. Every week. Every month. For the last 2 years. All the while becoming more aware of the suffering around me, the severity of which matched only by the apathy of those who have the means to stop it.  The people who hint at poetic suicide, (actually as I think about it that was the girl) those who have started manipulating already at this young age, and those who suffer at the hands of their own parents, all I see is misery shrouded by the smiles these people put on each day to hide the pain from others and themselves.  And deep in myself I shudder to think how bad things have gotten for those few I called my friends and Comrades that I left behind, that I haven't seen for years.    And here I sit typing away all my problems as if this was my journal. Instead of, of course, the work assigned to me.  Good morning, my internet Comrades. Fight the good fight."

So much of the population is so far removed form food production is seems of little concern.  There is no way forward to post-scarcity without finding ways to mechanize and automate food production in ways which are not ecologically damaging.    I think it is very troubling how little attention is paid by socialists to food production and the people who produce our food.

CommunismWorldwide,37cnmm,2DE,3,Tue May 26 17:59:51 2015 UTC,"Nasser was domestically repressive against all sorts of political enemies, from communists to Muslim brotherhood members. I obviously dislike him for this reason, but I'm an anarchist, so I'm obviously going to dislike anyone who seizes state power and doesn't immediately dismantle it.  With that said, Nasser was decently anti-imperialist enough. For a while, he was balancing USSR and US support, managing to get financial aid out of both of them (he also built a tower out of this money which is colloquially called Nasser's dick). He fought Israel quite well but his loss significantly demoralised Egyptian and Arab society as a whole. His war in Yemen was a failure and a waste of money. He represented a kind of secular nationalism that could have taken hold in the Arab world if it wasn't opposed so strongly by the USA/Israel/Khaleejis, and instead of this kind of left nationalism being popular, gulf funded islamists are. Communists were even popular in the 50s 60s 70s, as they took part in fighting in Lebanon and Palestine (google asad abukhalil, he's a guy who knows a lot about this).  He also instituted a bunch of public programs like healthcare and state schools. Overall I think he was a dictator, a dictator who did some great things, but a dictator nonetheless. I do think if his ideas caught on more, the Arab world would be in a much better place, but like I said, he was a tyrant."

The state controlled by commanding heights of the economy, but it was never democratic.   I think he definitely wasn't the best option but realistically this is a failure of the Soviet Union and the workers' movement in Egypt, as opposed to him being a particularly bad fellow.   Taken in the context of the failure of the radical left in Egypt, Nasser was probably the best outcome. Had his vision been complete, our world would look very different, a unified Arab state in counter to the Imperialist powers. Granted, our view of him might also have been quite different if his vision was achieved, because who knows how that might have ultimately turned out(A nationalist, expansionist state with very little democracy and very expansive state control of the economy? Doesn't sound like they'd be the good guys)."
CommunismWorldwide,37cnmm,Cyridius,2,Tue May 26 20:22:53 2015 UTC,"I have an overall positive view of Abdel Nasser. He certainly had obvious flaws, but he had extremely important contributions when viewed in modern Middle Eastern history.  First it's important to understand the context of Egypt at the time of his coup. Egypt was an agrarian fiefdom ruled by large landowners. Egypt had come under British colonialism, and there was a ruling elite class of Brits, French, Italians, and bourgeoise Egyptian elite. There was no healthcare, no public education, and before 1952, the government didn't even keep proper records on its economic progress. It was a banana republic monarchy with an absurdly wealthy aristocracy and a king who was ready to allow British occupation to continue if it meant he could remain in power.  ""In 1950 the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Sir William Slim, wrote to King Farouk about the necessity of basing troops in the Canal Zone... Farouk himself needed no convincing. ""The impression I got from him,"" Slim wrote when the British repoened the negotiations in the summer of 1950, was the hope ""that British troops would remain for a very long period in his own interests."" Farouk in other words played the part of a British collaborator who saw his own future bound up in the British presence. The British never let him forget, as Slim once bluntly reminded him, that there were ""no kings on the other side of the Iron Curtain.""   ""The British Empire in the Middle East"" by W.M Roger Louis, p. 692   Egyptians protested and rioted against British rule throughout the 40 years of official rule, only to be jailed and killed. Egyptian politicians were exiled to Sri Lanka, Malta, and the Seychelles for calling for independence.    So then comes Nasser and his military coup.  He instituted free public healthcare and free public education. Both of these were a first in Egyptian history, and I'm willing to bet Arab history as well.  He allowed women to vote, and he removed the constitutional clause on sharia.   Then he put in place agrarian reforms that completely changed the social structure of Egyptian society away from a feudal peasant system. He took the farmlands from their absentee owners and gave them to the farmers themselves. This drastically reduced poverty in Egypt. These policies were then drastically pulled back by his successor Anwar Sadat, who pretty much reversed all of Nasser's policies.  He then began an industrialisation program to transform Egypt from an agrarian society into an industrial one. In 1961/62 climate conditions ruined the cotton crop, which severely affected the Egyptian economy. Just a few years later and the industrial sector was larger than the agrarian one.  Nasser also supported the republican side during the North Yemen Civil War, and then tried to invade Yemen to ensure that the Republican side won. Saudi, Kuwait, Jordan, and UK supported the royalist side. He also armed and funded the Algerian independence movement during their independence war with France. Houari Boumedienne would later try to repay this debt during Egypt's war with Israel by buying and donating Soviet tanks.  He also co-founded the Non-Aligned movement, and tried to break the Arab world's colonial borders by uniting with other Arab republics. This led to the Arab Cold War against the religious monarchies, who inevitably won.  This is a quote from his biography by Joachim Joesten ""Nasser: The Rise to Power"" (1960):  One American Intelligence man in Cairo tersely summed it up for me in these words:  ""The real trouble with Nasser is that he has no vices. That makes him practically invulnerable. he can't be bought, bribed or even blackmailed. We hate his guts, but we can't do a thing about the guy. He's just too damn nice.""  TLDR: Nasser modernized Egypt by building modern institutions and public services. He transformed the country from a feudal state, and by doing so modernized the Arab world in turn. His flaws were that he was a lifelong military man who persecuted internal dissenters on the far-right and the far-left. Weirdly, his two greatest internal enemies were the Muslim Brotherhood and the communists. And his greatest mistake was naming Sadat his vice-president. He was the quintessential benevolent dictator."

This reminded me a lot of Chomsky in Manufacturing Consent, about how Liberal Democracies have been able to build up and maintain the hegemony of their ruling classes through a much more manipulative form of social engineering than the straight-forward, repressiveness of more classically authoritarian states under Monarchist or Fascist autarchies.   The Society of the Spectacle is in essence an attempt to explore the social imaginary in late, consumptionist capitalism through the conceptual grid of “the spectacle.”   I was re-reading The Soul of a Man Under Socialism, and it's very close to that same idea of ""entertaining the poor"", in order to delay or sublimate their class consciousness."

But that was only the start.  “Most people who were given the choice to raise wages – having cut them – did not. There is a route in the decision-tree that will only get played if people pursue a particularly ethical response, but very few people end up there. What we’ve realised is that it is not just the profit motive but also prudence, the need to survive at all costs, that pushes people in the game to go down more capitalist routes.”   Just goes to show that the moral bullshit liberals tout about the fat cats etc, is erroneous.

CommunismWorldwide,377dwb,lovelybone93,3,Tue May 26 16:59:56 2015 UTC,"IIRC C-M-C is part of the formula.   Aye, comrade /u/emnot3 is pretty well versed in its explanation. I'll summon him to help clarify, but here's one of his posts.  As for the Anarcho-Communist post-revolutionary period, /u/Capn_Blackbeard can no doubt explain that better than me.  But from what I've gathered, and I may be wrong, the post-revolutionary period would contain a transition of ""trial and error"" restructuring of society; seeing what works, what doesn't, and doing so on a local, community level as opposed to a top-down, mandated uniformity. It would be a continuous revolution, not too dissimilar to what Troskyists talk about in order to prevent a degenerate bureaucracy from forming; but on this case it's to keep the revolution present and prevent stagnation.  Malatesta’s Anarchist Vision of Life After Capitalism is an interesting read as to what that might look like:   After a revolution, “probably every possible form of possession and utilization of the means of production and all ways of distribution of produce will be tried out at the same time in one or many regions, and they will combine and be modified in various ways until experience will indicate which form, or forms, is or are, the most suitable. In the meantime, the need for not interrupting production and the impossibility of suspending consumption of the necessities of life will make it necessary to take decisions for the continuation of daily life at the same time as expropriation proceeds. One will have to do the best one can, and so long as one prevents the constitution and consolidation of new privilege, there will be time to find the best solutions.” (1984, p. 104)"

CommunismWorldwide,377dwb,lovelybone93,3,Tue May 26 17:41:06 2015 UTC,"Marxism-Leninism-Trotskyism isn't really an established thing. Orthodox Trotksyism is probably the more accurate term for it, but M-L-T sounds a bit nicer :) There's a few of us that sport that flair on /r/Socialism(I only changed it recently myself).  Essentially, Ortho Trots(AKA Bolshevik-Leninists) fully support the Soviet Union and its Communist Parties, whilst also claiming that the Soviet Union had degenerated and wasn't a Socialist state. It can probably be summed in with ""The USSR and the Communist Parties affiliated are totally fucked, but we can save them!""  That is, for example, at the outbreak of World War II, Trotsky supported the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland and it supported the annexations in Eastern Europe, but claimed that is the Soviet Union were truly a workers' state then the proletariat would've risen up in support of their invasions.   Similarly, when asked to appear before the House of Un-American Activities Committee, Trotsky planned on viciously attacking the committee itself in defence of the Communist Parties in America(The favour was not returned, keep in mind, and at this time the OffComs were actively trying to kill Trotsky).   Or in Spain, Trotsky called for POUM to organise as an external faction of the PCE, not in opposition to it.   So, we can see a trend here. Trotsky was theoretically and politically opposed to the Soviet Union and Official Communism, but still supported it as he believed it had the potential to change, he called for a workers' revolution in the Soviet Union for example to take political control from the bureaucracy.   M-L-Ts/B-Ls/Orthos tend to stand in this same tradition, as opposed to the likes of Cliffites who claimed the USSR was a State Capitalist dictatorship and as such was the same or even worse than the Western Bourgeois Democracies.   Trots are also much more in favour of soviet power and as a means on which political organisation can be based.   If you have more questions on Trotskyism shoot them my way. I didn't address many of the nuances of it in my post."

CommunismWorldwide,3751eh,reddfloyd,2,Mon May 25 16:46:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that hard drugs destroy lives and relationships, but I think that society as a whole needs to recognize that people are going to do drugs despite the laws and danger and work from there to negate the harmful effects of drug use, get addicts help without treating them worse than animals, and to promote actual drug education and not just THEY'RE BAD DON'T DO THEM OR YOU'RE SCUM. Cops literally cannot keep drugs out of prisons, how can we realistically aspire to keep hard drugs out of the rest of the world?  Now what I'm about to say is an extremely unpopular statement, but it's fact. Beyond the threat of over dosing, hard drugs are not very harmful to your body. That's the drugs themselves I'm talking about, imagine pure meth or heroin. Most of the physically harmful effects that come from habitual drug use actually come from the adulterants introduced to them in the black market. This is why I think drugs should be legal and strictly regulated to ensure quality and purity. I actually don't think they should be taxed heavily, but that's an entirely different manner and solely because high prices will drive users to the black market. Here, take a look at this dutch heroin which is about 80 - 90 percent pure: https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/heroin/images/archive/heroin_powder__i2008e1117_disp.jpg  Now compare it to this American black tar heroin: https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/heroin/images/archive/heroin_tar__i2006e0997_disp.jpg  Which would you rather put in your veins?  Yeah, pure heroin is white. Any discoloration is adulterant.  Now, scientific studies into the issue are quite limited, and if you look up harmful effects of heroin you're going to be confronted with .gov domains and shit like drugfreeworld.org which is blatantly biased. These things spout the usual rhetoric of drugs r bad and say that ""research suggests"" bold claims without citing a goddam thing.  Here, take a look at this, it's quite interesting and actually has fucking citations: http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/cu/cu4.html  Perhaps you can't spare the time to read through that so I'll just quote some of it here.   We finally wrote to some of the most eminent research workers in the field of drug addiction, explaining our problem and requesting scientific data on the deleterious effects of narcotic drugs. They indicated, in their reply, that there was no real evidence of brain damage or other serious organic disease resulting from the continued use of narcotics (morphine and related substances), but that there was undoubted psychological and social damage. However, they made no differentiation between such damage as might be caused by narcotics and that which might have been present before addiction, or might have been caused, at least in part, by other factors. Moreover, they were unable to direct us to any actual studies on the alleged harmful effects of narcotic drugs. At a later date we also consulted officials of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs, and they, too, were unable to direct us to any scientific studies on the actual damaging effects of morphine or heroin addiction. The Narcotic Control Division of the Canadian Government's Department of Health and Welfare was likewise unable to direct us to scientific studies on this subject.   British Columbia Study, p. 510.   Here is the broad general conclusion which Dr. Light and his associates reached: The study shows that morphine addiction is not characterized by physical deterioration or impairment of physical fitness aside from the addiction per se. There is no evidence of change in the circulatory, hepatic, renal or endocrine functions. When it is considered that these subjects had been addicted for at least five years, some of them for as long as twenty years, these negative observations are highly significant.   Arthur B. Light and Edward G. Torrance, in A.M.A. Archives of Internal Medicine, 44 (1929): 876.   A similar study made at Bellevue Hospital in New York City yielded similar findings. Dr. George B. Wallace summed up both studies: ""It was shown that continued taking of opium or any of its derivatives resulted in no measurable organic damage. The addict when not deprived of his opium showed no abnormal behavior which distinguished him from a nonaddict.""   George B. Wallace, ""The Rehabilitation of the Drug Addict,"" Journal of Educational Sociology, 4 (1931): 347, quoted in Daniel M. Wilner and Gene G. Kassebaum, eds., Narcotics (New York: Blakiston Div., McGraw-Hill, 1965), pp. xix-xx.   Through the years, this has been the view of authorities familiar with addiction. Thus Dr. Walter G. Karr, the University of Pennsylvania biochemist who participated in the Light-Torrance Study, reported in 1932: ""The addict under his normal tolerance of morphine is medically a well man.""   Walter G. Karr, cited in Drug Addiction: Crime or Disease? Interim and Final Reports of the Joint Committee of the American Bar Association and the American Medical Association on Narcotic Drugs (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 1961), p. 47. Hereinafter cited as ABA-AMA Report.   Three other authorities who had long worked with heroin addicts from New York City's slums--- Drs. Richard Brotman, Alan S. Meyer, and Alfred M. Freedman--- had this to add in 1965: ""Medical knowledge has long since laid to rest the myth that opiates inevitably and observably harm the body.""   Richard Brotman, Alan S. Meyer, and Alfred M. Freedman, ""An Approach to Treating Narcotic Addicts Based on a Community Mental Health Diagnosis,"" Comprehensive Psychiatry, 6 (April, 1965): 108.   Also in 1956, Dr. George H. Stevenson and his British Columbia associates gave complete neurological and psychiatric examinations to imprisoned addicts, and questioned them and their relatives in an attempt to find mental deterioration. They reported: ""As to possible damage to the brain, the result of lengthy use of heroin, we can only say that neurologic and psychiatric examinations have not revealed evidence of brain damage.... This is in marked contrast to the prolonged and heavy use of alcohol, which in combination with other factors can cause pathologic changes in brains, and reflects such damage in intellectual and emotional deterioration, as well as convulsions, neuritis, and even psychosis.""   British Columbia Study, pp. 514-515.   The British Columbia report continued: Our psychological studies do not support the common assertion that long continued heroin use produces appreciable psychological deterioration. So far as we can determine, the personality characteristics commonly seen in addicts are assumed to have been largely present before their addiction, and the same characteristics are commonly seen in most recidivist [relapsing] delinquents who do not use narcotic drugs. Moreover, it is not evident that these personality weaknesses are aggravated or made worse by addiction as such. Years of crime, years of prison, years of unemployment, years of anti-social hostility (and society's anti-addict hostility), years of immorality--- these can hardly be expected to strengthen a personality and eradicate its weaknesses. If ""years of addiction"" is added to these other unfavorable behavioral and environmental factors, why should the personality deterioration (if measurable) be attributed to drug addiction as if it were the only responsible factor?   I could go on and on, that webpage is a wealth of sweet sweet science, unlike the dontdodrugs.gov websites.  You'll notice that study is very old. That does not discredit it. In the last century public reception of drug users went from ""eww gross"" to as Ronald Reagan put it ""a threat to national security"". And those studies were not done on people using pure, unadulterated heroin. I would love for a study to be done regarding the effects of long term, pure heroin use but that would necessitate a group of people giving pure heroin to another group of people over a period of years, which would be extremely unpopular in the eye of the public, who are more scared of heroin than they are of communism."

It's a report that has absolutely nothing to do with Ezra Pound, but it caught my attention as it was dated 1/18/1974 and described as being a report from Chile.    COMMENT: (U) Promulgation of Decree on the Control of Arms in October of 1972 (during the ALLENDE Government) was a major constitutional victory for the Opposition (Christian Democrats, National Party, etc.) in their efforts to legislate an arms control law to control the leftist armed groups and other extremist elements who operated under the protective wing of the U.P. Government. Decree is still in force today and a principal legal tool of the Military Junta.   Some nice information to know whenever right-wingers start talking about how the evil commies use gun control to steal freedom.   Another document on the results page, also unrealted to Ezra Pound, is a response to a letter written to President Reagan regarding the Letelier assassination. The response, which bears Elliott Abrams' signature, essentially restates what the person already knew and says the US is dedicated to seeking justice in the case.     Back to my life. Be warned, this is going to be longer than it needs but I have a lot to unpack. I'm 18 years old, a senior in high school. Around September of last year I got my first job as a page at the local public library. Honestly, I more or less enjoy the job: I get to spend all the day around books, it's not the most demanding job around to say the least, at least four of my co-workers are queer and none of us have been forced to hide it (although one of them is a self-hating Christian), and me and three of the other pages have become pretty close friends since (three of the four of us) were hired.   Up until now there had been no issues, our little group did our job and did it at a faster pace than several of the other pages. I should mention that pages are the ones who shelve books and make sure everything is in order on the shelves, we also set up and break down programs. Yesterday me and one of my friends who we'll initialize to MC were working on a set-up. MC is a year younger than me, goes to my school, and is a fellow gay kid. We share a sense of humor and, because of the previously mentioned factors, usually find a lot to talk about, so we tend to take longer than we need to do set-ups. Usually this is never a problem--we always finish on time, and it's rare for us to so swamped with returns that things would get backed up. But so anyway, we finish up at about 6:30 and LH, a librarian who's also in charge of the pages, says that she'd like to speak with us after our breaks.   On our break we talk with JM, who's part of our little group, and tell her about what LH said. Since she's a few years older than us, JM says reasonably that it's probably nothing and that we'll be fine, but we're still worried. It turns out that the set-up is exactly what LH wanted to talk to us about, and for about ten minutes she gives a lecture on the need for efficiency and what we should do if we feel like a set-up is going to take more than thirty minutes (nevermind that set-ups generally do take 30+ mins.) But basically she's nice about everything and we think it'll be the end of things. Not so much.  About 20 minutes later everything's been shelved. When that happens we're supposed to make sure the shelves are in order or, if you're in the children's department, see if there are any projects for programs that need to be done. MC is already working on one of these projects and when I go to do another one a librarian says Wait, you're not allowed to sit with him, don't shoot the messanger. Now this is where I started getting annoyed. It's a punishment you give to elementary school kids when they won't stop giggling together during class, it's a punishment I haven't receive since third grade, and one I'd rather not receive at a fucking job. In fact the more I thought about the more infantilizing it seemed. Until a few weeks ago we were the two youngest pages on staff, and I can't imagine them doing something like this to anyone else, so it has to be completely based on age. Surely that would be the end of it. Guess again!  Today, as I'm sitting in school, watching Dr. Strangelove in my AP Gov class--a class taught by a teacher who once said if he could he would ""be a benevolent dictator, like Franco""--JM, who's at work, starts texting in our group chat. Apparently LD, the obscure IT guy, received an email about the set-up last night. In addition to that, LD apparently thought the set-up was done poorly. This is odd for two reasons: 1) LD is the IT guy and has nothing to do with set-ups 2) there was a librarian in the room when we were finishing th set-up, if it was poorly done they should have told us. JM also texted to tell as that LH and two other librarians had a talk about the set-up today, so now I'm sitting around getting anxious because the librarians seem to be making a non-issue into something bigger than it is. And while there's a 0.00001% chance of me and MC getting fired, I can't help but feel worried. I'm going away to college in a few months and even with a 17k/year academic scholarship I'm going to end up in an ocean of debt just because private colleges cost a shitload, so I need this job to save up as much as I can. I'm also going to be studying literature and everyone seems intent on letting me know how unprofitable a degree it is even though I don't give a shit--it's what I love and I'm going to study it no matter what. I'm not worried about my career because I don't view my life diachronically.   We'll see what happens tomorrow.    So with that needlessly long narrative over, let me talk about how it's made me think about labor and management. The librarians like to pretend they're buddy buddy with the pages, but the reality is that they're our superiors, they tell us what to do and they have the power to fire us. At least as far as I've been able to discnern, since we're a public institution we don't have a boss or owners in the traditional sense, just a hierarchy of managers. The odd part about these managers is that they're not just managers, they're also librarians. Ultimately our managers are workers too, right? So why do they seem to want act like bosses?  A few months ago I came across an interest term in an article on slacking: empty labor. Empty labor is essentially when a person gets paid for work they don't actually do. Basically it's a term that means getting paid for slacking off. This entire affair started because they realized what MC and I were doing probably involved empty labor. But here's the kicker: the pages almost certainly do less empty labor than the librarians, the circulation desk people, and the security guards (who are literally paid to sit around and wait for something that never happens.)   Despite this, we're the only ones who are expected to keep up the illusion that we're working 24/7: if it's slow the librarians, the circulation people, and the security guards openly read, use their phones, and check Facebook. If there's nothing for us to do, we're forced to ask the librarians for a task. Basically, we're paid less and given more shit for how we spend our time than anyone else. And I feel really whiny saying because sure they deserve the wages they get and then some, but it's true and the more I think about my future college debt the more frustrated I get that I'm forced to work harder only to be treated worse. MC and I having one infraction is cause for emails and meetings, but the librarians etc. can't even incur infractions because of the hierarchy.    Aside from all that life is pretty good. I get sad and lonely for no apparent reason sometimes, but I have a small number of friends who I really care about and who really care about me, and I'm excited about the future. I was reading over an incredibly self-critical and pessimistic journal entry from September of 2013 and I couldn't help be amazed at how much I've grown as a person since then. I'm in such a better place emotionally, socially, and physically (having conquered an eating disorder than had plaguing for the longest time) than I was this time last year. I'm almost proud of myself."
CommunismWorldwide,36xdaa,Adahn5,2,Sat May 23 01:21:51 2015 UTC,"Some nice information to know whenever right-wingers start talking about how the evil commies use gun control to steal freedom.    Indeed. I always like to point out that the norm is indeed to eliminate access to guns for all civilians in most Liberal, Capitalist Democracies. The only reason it's an exception in the United States is because the country's radicals tend to be predominantly right-wing. Chris Hedges talks a bit about this here.   It's a punishment you give to elementary school kids when they won't stop giggling together during class, it's a punishment I haven't receive since third grade, and one I'd rather not receive at a fucking job.   I worked at a library too for about a year—granted it was my school's library, but I can relate to a lot of what you're talking about. As for the punishment, of course it's bullshit! And you have a right to be mad. You were being treated as a child, rather than the adult, autonomous and responsible worker that you've grown into.   2) there was a librarian in the room when we were finishing th set-up, if it was poorly done they should have told us.   Does sound like you're being set up to take some kind of fall; or at the very least made to look bad when in reality you weren't doing anything wrong.

I'm not worried about my career because I don't view my life diachronically.    Good for you! I should have done that the first time around. It's what I always wanted to study (literature that is), and instead I ended up going to England to study Law, before I ultimately decided to pursue what I really wanted, and get my B.A. in English Literature. So you do what you love. The majority of us don't end up working in any field that's even related to what we study anyway.   The librarians like to pretend they're buddy buddy with the pages, but the reality is that they're our superiors, they tell us what to do and they have the power to fire us.   That's a pretty good observation. Zizek says something very similar here. It's spot on.   So why do they seem to want act like bosses?   That's where you need an Anarchist analysis of hierarchy and authority. I'll let our comrades /u/Capn_Blackbeard, /u/Sillandria, /u/Petalklunk, /u/The_Mermaid, /u/geckos100, /u/narrenburg, /u/dirtysquatter or /u/MakhnoYouDidnt give you their two cents on that.   Empty labor is essentially when a person gets paid for work they don't actually do. Basically it's a term that means getting paid for slacking off.   Bloody hell do I miss comrade /u/YoungCyclone ::sigh:: This is just the kind of thing he loves to talk about. He's very big on Buckminster Fuller and the idea that we're making up bullshit jobs because we need to justify our existence through employment.   I feel really whiny saying because sure they deserve the wages they get and then some, but it's true and the more I think about my future college debt the more frustrated I get that I'm forced to work harder only to be treated worse.   That's where the Buckminster Fuller quote comes in. We live in a world where a single person does indeed produce more than they need to sustain themselves. This notion notion that we have to ""earn a living"" and then ""pay to live"", through rent, through acquisition of commodities, food and resources through a market, etc. It's all bullshit. The objective conditions are such that we very well could sustain ourselves and end bullshit jobs, fill the truly socially necessary jobs, and produce enough for everyone to give and take freely.  Anyway thank you for taking the time to write all that, comrade /u/SteadilyTremulous. Feel free to tell us your thoughts at any time. We're here for you :3"

But we're here for you, /u/SteadilyTremulous we'll support you and listen to you, and if we can help we'll do that too :3    As for myself, my life is somewhat on stand-by because I'm waiting for my acceptance letter to come in from the University I applied to for this summer. I'm 99% certain I'll get in, but I'm growing impatient because I need the letter and subsequently the paperwork to start the visa application process on my end.  Dealing with this has reminded me how absurd borders are, and who they benefit exactly. It makes me think about the day when we'll abolish the nation state and borders will subsequently vanish; and we'll be able to cross the lands freely and openly without having to go through a clusterfuck of red tape, check points, distrust and consequential xenophobia from one area to another."

You're very conscious for your age, as are many comrades here, and the unfortunate consequence of that is that you have to stomach much of the ignorance and false consciousness that surrounds you in the form of your classmates and assorted liberal bystanders.  Once you get to college you'll have a bit more opportunity to meet like-minded people. Likely not as many as you might hope, but it'll get better, I promise you that. You'll also have a better platform from which to organise your own group of comrades. Starting a Socialist book club, for instance, where you read the works of both State and Libertarian Socialists is a great way of making new acquaintances that are interested in overthrowing the status quo."

Aside from that, I graduated from middle school on Tuesday, and had my graduation party at a country club filled with aging white men who have likely thrived off of the exploitation of the laboring poor; some of whom have been forced to come here by means deemed illegal by the state to try to get a better life for themselves and their families. Alongside this, the city manager, who made about 12 and a half times my family's median income (before we lost a client who didn't pay us in the first place and taxes on property and electric have gone up), the highest-paid politician, was in the dining hall having some probable political meeting.

Aside from this, I plan on reading the pile of books I have on my desk, which is constituted of/by four different copies of the Manifesto of the Communist Party; John Steinbeck's 'In Dubious Battle,' 'The Grapes of Wrath,' and 'Sweet Thursday;' and Lenin's 'State and Revolution' and 'Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism.' Alongside this, I have the Bhagavad Gita, of which I plan to read only about one chapter,—chapter four—mainly because it's my father's, and I've taken an interest in said chapter, for it has some decent things to say. I also have planned a critique of fascism.  Aside from this, I've been sleeping at around 3:00 in the morning daily, and waking up about noon.

When my family was invited to fundraisers, galas and cultural events and fancy dinners with ambassadors, politicians or members of the judiciary, whether it was in Sweden, Italy or in the US; the great majority were of course Capitalists who had inevitable acquired their ill-gotten gains through the exploitation of people, either local or abroad, through various means.  During those days I was a little kid, and I didn't really have a concept of what any of this meant; but I later learned that my father, who's always been a Marxist-Leninist, had to swallow down his disgust and mingle, mix and meet.  It wasn't all bad, though. Sometimes there were artists, intellectuals and some very surprising Socialists a la Engels. They were too few and far between, though.   I plan on reading the pile of books   Be sure to add a little Anarchist literature to that, as well as some Feminist stuff, some stuff on the media and a modern approach to today's economy.

CommunismWorldwide,36q676,PandaSymposium,4,Thu May 21 17:53:18 2015 UTC,"/u/Solidblues has the right of it. It's been seen as a massive failure, historically speaking, in terms of tactics to bring about class consciousness and a prospective revolution.  Two main examples of this in our modern history would be the tactics promoted by the Comintern during the ""Third Period"", and the CPUSA's line during the 1930s on how things have to get worse before they get better. The Third Period featured very adventurist tactics due to the fundamentally incorrect analysis that global capitalism had entered into such a crisis that its collapse was inevitable. This led to such theories as ""social-fascism"" which comrade /u/SolidBlues can tell you about in more detail, and the German Communist Party proclaiming things like ""After Hitler, us!"".  Many communists during this period felt that attacks on the working class, Hitler's election and his mishandling of the economy, the Depression etc. would revolutionize mass segments of the proletariat. What happened, of course, was that fascism took root amongst a largest segment of the working classes in places like Italy and Germany, while the rest of the proletariat attached itself to the bourgeois parties.  Accelerationism espouses economic determinism in that it assumes that a Socialist Revolution is absolutely inevitable. We can see from our history, however, that crises of capitalism do not directly lead to a mass increase of class consciousness or socialist, revolutionary thought. A bit enough crisis might become the fertile ground for Revolution, but without class consciousness and organisation before hand, what arises from it is often greater concentration of capital in the hands of fewer people, a cutting of social services and safety net programs, and a radicalisation of all ideological thought which might very well lead to a Fascist Revolution rather than a socialist one."

I use it to refer to states like the DPRK, post-Mao China, post-Stalin USSR, and sometimes Cuba. I should probably just say state capitalist, but I usually find I hate the people who use that term a lot."

Lenin used it:    State capitalism would be a step forward as compared with the present state of affairs in our Soviet Republic. If in approximately six months’ time state capitalism became established in our Republic, this would be a great success and a sure guarantee that within a year socialism will have gained a permanently firm hold and will have become invincible in this country.   A few times even:   The state capitalism, which is one of the principal aspects of the New Economic Policy, is, under Soviet power, a form of capitalism that is deliberately permitted and restricted by the working class. Our state capitalism differs essentially from the state capitalism in countries that have bourgeois governments in that the state with us is represented not by the bourgeoisie, but by the proletariat, who has succeeded in winning the full confidence of the peasantry. Unfortunately, the introduction of state capitalism with us is not proceeding as quickly as we would like it. For example, so far we have not had a single important concession, and without foreign capital to help develop our economy, the latter’s quick rehabilitation is inconceivable.   So just use it Solid.

Ones individual race or gender status does not preclude possible membership in the exploiter class."
CommunismWorldwide,36mwjk,l337kid,4,Wed May 20 21:38:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think the issue is one's identification as a woman.   Feminism isn't as concerned with the individual identification of woman as such. What is more important is the relation of gendered subjects within conceptual and material frameworks. This has often be done on the basis of a conception of woman that tended to be monolithic and essentialist, justified through biological determinism, but recently the very idea that Woman is a unified concept is being questioned. Judith Butler (1990) explores this:   Foucault points out that juridical systems of power produce the subjects they subsequently come to represent.1 Juridical notions of power appear to regulate political life in purely negative terms—that is, through the limitation, prohibition, regulation, control, and even “protection” of individuals related to that political structure through the contingent and retractable operation of choice. But the subjects regulated by such structures are, by virtue of being subjected to them, formed, defined, and reproduced in accordance with the requirements of those structures. If this analysis is right, then the juridical formation of language and politics that represents women as “the subject” of feminism is itself a discursive formation and effect of a given version of representational politics. And the feminist subject turns out to be discursively constituted by the very political system that is supposed to facilitate its emancipation. This becomes politically problematic if that system can be shown to produce gendered subjects along a differential axis of domination or to produce subjects who are presumed to be masculine. In such cases, an uncritical appeal to such a system for the emancipation of “women” will be clearly self-defeating. [...]   Juridical power inevitably “produces” what it claims merely to represent; hence, politics must be concerned with this dual function of power: the juridical and the productive. In effect, the law produces and then conceals the notion of “a subject before the law”2 in order to invoke that discursive formation as a naturalized foundational premise that subsequently legitimates that law’s own regulatory hegemony. It is not enough to inquire into how women might become more fully represented in language and politics. Feminist critique ought also to understand how the category of “women,” the subject of feminism, is produced and restrained by the very structures of power through which emancipation is sought.   So to claim that feminism must be based on the subject and identification of Woman is to fall pray to the very systems of power the oppress women in the first place which in the today's world is uniquely tied to capitalist systems. This, though, does not mean that feminism is not needed even if the feminist subject as such ""should nowhere be presumed"", as Butler claims, since feminism is not rooted primarily in a commitment to gender essentialism but rather in an analysis of gender relations and the gendered subject as a whole, regardless of individual identification.   However, if that is your only identification, as opposed to a proletarian\labor aristocrat who happens to be a woman, then you alienate\isolate yourself from the majority of the world's women who are not American, not making $35,000 a year, and not benefiting from imperialism (a form of patriarchy) and existing as part of an exploiter class, the top 1% of the global income ""earners"".   The subject of feminism should not be monolithic. So even if one identifies as a Western woman that does not preclude them from supporting the feminisms of non-Western countries, though one must not assume to understand their position. Indeed, I doubt that workers in America can ever assume to understand the struggles of workers in China because the material conditions are different. If one wishes to fault feminism for mistaking the experiences of women in Western countries then one must also fault communism for essentializing the struggles of workers into one conception of a worker."

The discourse of first world feminism has little to do with structural, material improvement for the lives of women in the third world, nor recognition of one's own involvement in global capitalist oppression.  Sadly, we know this to be the case, because its most profitable this way. It's not the feminists fault. The reasons for popularity in the opportunist trends of feminism are material. Trade-union mentality is established, and nothing more.  They are bought off. Like the rest of the first world."
CommunismWorldwide,36mwjk,l337kid,5,Fri May 22 02:17:00 2015 UTC,"Ones individual race or gender status does not preclude possible membership in the exploiter class.   Indeed not. But oppressions overlap. If you're a cishet white man worker, you're oppressed on the basis of your class. If you're a gay het black man who's a worker, you're oppressed on the basis of your sexual preference, your ethnicity and your class. In the case of women, remember that they only control 1% of the world's economy, despite being 50% of the population.  I'll quote comrade /u/Heidegger on this:   Capitalism tends to reward divide-and-conquer tactics for bringing people under the market's discipline; creating tiers of relative oppression and privilege is cheaper than unvarnished, across the board oppression (which can foster dangerous class consciousness). Patriarchy is how the gender-based wealth gap manifests in this form. Patri-archy is a structure of power relations, and wealth is economic power.  But even if the wealth gap were to vanish tomorrow, we would still live in a world where men had called the shots for millennia and we would still have to deal with the legacy of that domination embedded in everything from language, to morality, to history, to more concrete things like city planning, work duties, and industrial design--in all such things, the apparently genderless subject has always silently been assumed to be male.  Some particular ways women are oppressed are rape, prostitution, abortion law, pay inequality, and gender stereotypes. I'd recommend Andrea Dworkin's writings for more info.  Feminism is essential to socialism in the same way that socialism is essential to democracy. Democracy as typically conceived does not include workplace democracy, and therefore leaves a huge hole in the project. The point of democracy is to give people equal say in how the community is run, but there exists something called capital that systematically gives certain people more say than others; without addressing this construct, democracy can only be achieved in form (i.e. by positivistically setting out an arbitrary set of necessary/sufficient conditions, then meeting them, without regard for other conditions that might have been neglected whist originally formulating the criteria) not in spirit.  Likewise, socialism without feminism is blind to a whole realm of oppression that is often more important to women's lives than outright class-based wealth exploitation (though they are causally related, the former is more than just an aspect of the latter)."

Yes, but rarely do people who question ""western Feminism"" in favour of Feminism in the Global South know much of anything, such as the All-China Women's Federation, the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan, or the Association for the Protection and Defense of Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia.  Has there been a co-optation of Feminism in the form of Choice (Liberal) Feminism by the Capitalist class? Absolutely. In the same way that Capitalism has been able to co-opt Gay Rights, and more in favour of pulling it away from its subversive roots and institutionalising it in order to then exploit its proponents.  No one here wants you to identify as a Choice Feminist, however keep in mind that Proletarian Feminism in the form of Marxist-Feminism or Anarcha-Feminism, does tremendous work both in the Global North as well as in the Global South. Just because the struggles are different does not make them less valid.  You might make a pragmatic case that some geographic areas have a more urgent need, but when you deny the existence of women's struggles in a country like the United States, where a woman might be imprisoned for having an abortion, you're not being consistent in your application either of Marxist or Anarchist analysis or principles."

That's because the people that would be critical are too busy fighting real revolution, not writing blogs and arguments on the internet.  Marxist Leninists in the third world don't have time to internet debate with first world feminists about how their line isn't revolutionary.  I consider myself a feminist - I just have issues with intersectionality and the line that first world feminism is forced to be because of its imperialist capitalist relationship to the third world.  So consider this a critique from the revolutionary left, the M-L left, side. I cannot but call it as I see it.   The first world is bought off, and this intersectional theory is evidence of it: it attempts to break off Marxism into its constituent parts, rob it of revolutionary potential, and forget the accomplishments of Lenin and the USSR - which made many inroads against patriarchy as well as capitalism.  The third world doesn't forget this, and that's why you'll see little done, as you yourself say, by groups such as    All-China Women's Federation, the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan, or the Association for the Protection and Defense of Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia"

CommunismWorldwide,36i44y,Godeliva,6,Tue May 19 15:39:05 2015 UTC,"Um, I see a odd capitalist vibe from this. One of the biggest causes of marking woman authors as special and ""girls only"" is the marketing. If you write a book and you are a woman or you write something considered too feminine by the marketing people, your book will be marketed as being only for women. That means that people who are not particularly looking for woman authors or those that do not look in the ""woman's"" section of the bookstore, are less likely to buy them due to pure statistics. Now, this is not to say that passive sexism does not play a part especially in how people are less likely to buy something if they think that it is ""girl's only"". Certainly that has a part. But the biggest issue to me is not the consumer but the marketers themselves that insist on shoehorning things into marketable categories.   I’m sure both of these people are smart, engaged and not deliberately or actively sexist - but when your worldview is solely shaped by men, you are missing out. And like it or not, your taste in music, books, television or art says something about you: it sends a message about what you think is worth your time, what you think is interesting and who you think is smart. So if the only culture you pay attention to is created by men, or created by white people, you are making an explicit statement about who and what is important.    The author places a lot of blame on the consumer when it is the marketers that are to blame since they create the sexist marketing categories to begin with by the very act of saying that this or that book is a ""girls only"" book."

Well, the problem comes in that the political subject as an individual is a product of bourgeois democracy which requires a division of the subject between an individual actor and a political being. In fact, I would say that even when the Law treats women as individuals, this is still not enough since the individual under consideration tends to favor a male POV, i.e. men are considered the default person that women have to conform to. It is not enough to be individualistic.   Most people make decisions based on self-interest   Yet the piece never goes onto to suggest how capitalism forces people to act in this way.

I doubt Soros, or say Buffet are necessarily evil. Or your average banker, etc. They aren't 'gaming' the system, or exploiting it, they're using it precisely as they're meant to.  Liberals love to apply their morality by saying that they're not good people, and that good people wouldn't do it. The argument is naive and irrelevant because if a Capitalist didn't exploit the workers he would be replaced by another Capitalist that did.  Ultimately that's why we ought to institute a People's Court to judge the many Capitalists on a case by case basis, and see through their history what they've done. What kind of punishment they deserve for what they did, and whether their exploitation caused damage, death or destruction.  Someone like Gates, for instance, might be a worthy contribution to a Socialist society. Whilst someone like the Koch brothers might get thrown into the Gulag.

CommunismWorldwide,360lhk,Varroun,5,Fri May 15 07:16:09 2015 UTC,"Section 20. Paleolibertarianism of article  Murray Rothbard:       In 1989, Rothbard left the Libertarian Party and began building bridges to the post-Cold War anti-interventionist right, calling himself a paleolibertarian, a conservative reaction against the cultural liberalism of mainstream libertarianism.   Paleolibertarianism sought to appeal to disaffected working class whites through a synthesis of cultural conservatism and libertarian economics.  A 2014 article in the New York Times noted that Rothbard ""applauded the “right-wing populism” of David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard who ran for governor of Louisiana.""  According to Reason, Rothbard advocated right-wing populism in part because he was frustrated that mainstream thinkers were not adopting the libertarian view and suggested that Duke and former Wisconsin U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy were models for an ""Outreach to the Rednecks"" effort that could be used by a broad libertarian/paleoconservative coalition. Working together, the paleo coalition would expose the ""unholy alliance of 'corporate liberal' Big Business and media elites, who, through big government, have privileged and caused to rise up a parasitic Underclass."" Rothbard blamed this ""Underclass"" for ""looting and oppressing the bulk of the middle and working classes in America.""  In addition to praising Duke's political strategy, Rothbard favored Duke's substantive political program, stating that there was ""nothing"" in it that ""could not also be embraced by paleoconservatives or paleo-libertarians; lower taxes, dismantling the bureaucracy, slashing the welfare system, attacking affirmative action and racial set-asides, calling for equal rights for all Americans, including whites.""  In an interview on Reason TV Gene Epstein', described as ""a devotee"" of Rothbard, lamented Rothbard's period of ""infatuation"" with Southern populism, Pat Buchanan and David Duke.   Rothbard supported the presidential campaign of Pat Buchanan in 1992, and wrote that ""with Pat Buchanan as our leader, we shall break the clock of social democracy.""  When Buchanan dropped out of the Republican primary race, Rothbard then shifted his interest and support to Ross Perot,  who Rothbard wrote had ""brought an excitement, a verve, a sense of dynamics and of open possibilities to what had threatened to be a dreary race.""  Rothbard ultimately supported George Bush over Bill Clinton in the 1992 election.

CommunismWorldwide,35kvqu,One-Flower_Coyote,1 point,Mon May 11 19:17:21 2015 UTC,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson suggested over the weekend that schools with transgender bathroom polices were undermining what children were learning about biology in science class.    This guy does realize that biology isn't just about sex, right? Freud would have a field day.   According to Carlson, this caused “outrage” because it would allow “a student who is male but identifies as a female” to use the girl’s bathroom.    Notice how he shifts words from ""male/female"" to girl. Now the problem of sex-gender is complicated, especially considering that there are actual differences between a ""male"" body and a ""female"" body. Many feminists in the past, and even some today of the more materialist inclinations, still keep up the sex-gender distinction. To me, there is two important problems with this divide: 1) it fails to take into account how variable sexed bodies are and 2) it ignores the role that sexual desire plays in constructing socially acceptable identities.   Although ""biologically"" there are only two sexes, these are mere categories that individuals can vary between. There are people born with any number of chromosomal configurations, genital appearances, and sexed attributes like facial structures, skeletal shape, and voice depth. How we define sexed bodies constructs which attributes are considered male and female, and thus what male and female bodies are. That is why I prefer ""sexed"" bodies and ""sexed"" attributes, since the process of sexing these things is what makes us consider them sexed in the first place. So to claim that sex and gender are different and that gender is socially constructed while sex is not (which is what often happens with sex-gender divisions) is to downplay the role that language has in ordering the diverse sexual features that are possible in humans into two nice categories that do not reflect reality per se. It is no accident that intersex and trans individuals are considered to be ""going against biology"" when they are as much a product of human biology as anybody else. Though it should be noted that sex and gender are distinct, and that they represent different phenomenon, but they are interrelated meaning that the play of difference between gender and sex is vital to both of their constructions and it is impossible to isolate one from the other. There is understandably a reluctance to consider that sexual desire has any part in gendering, but the fact that so many people see trans individuals as ""lying"" about themselves shows that implied sexual features come with gender. It is unavoidable: desire has some affect on the relation between sexed bodies and the gendered identity. If I present as a woman, people presume that I have breasts, vulva, two X chromosomes, etc. since those are the bits that someone who sexual desires me would want. Now, one can make the case, as I do, that we shouldn't presume these things, but it does not deflect that people do. Given that, sexual desire, especially in the form of compulsory heterosexuality, mediates the relation between sex and gender, and restricts the possible configurations that are acceptable. Just look at the definition of heterosexuality in the form of cis/trans relations. A cis man in a relationship with a trans woman is considered straight regardless of the genital state of the trans woman, showing that something innately sexual (heterosexuality) can be defined in terms of gender and not sex. This is because our construction of sexual desire relies upon compulsory heterosexuality, which constructs sex and gender in an interconnected way. To critique gender one must critique sex as well. To quote the Wiki on Judith Butler:   A significant yet sometimes overlooked part of Butler's argument concerns the role of sex in the construction of ""natural"" or coherent gender and sexuality. Butler explicitly challenges biological accounts of binary sex, reconceiving the sexed body as itself culturally constructed by regulative discourse. The supposed obviousness of sex as a natural biological fact attests to how deeply its production in discourse is concealed. The sexed body, once established as a ""natural"" and unquestioned ""fact,"" is the alibi for constructions of gender and sexuality, unavoidably more cultural in their appearance, which can purport to be the just-as-natural expressions or consequences of a more fundamental sex. On Butler's account, it is on the basis of the construction of natural binary sex that binary gender and heterosexuality are likewise constructed as natural. In this way, Butler claims that without a critique of sex as produced by discourse, the sex/gender distinction as a feminist strategy for contesting constructions of binary asymmetric gender and compulsory heterosexuality will be ineffective.     “Isn’t a little weird that that a school which is supposed to be rooted in science and the scientific method is teaching now that there is that there is no difference between men and women and you can change your sex?” he wondered. “Of course, that’s contrary to basic biology.”   Doesn't he realize that by allowing trans individuals to use the bathroom for their gender they are still recognizing the difference between the genders?"

GALACTIC FEDERATION    In Metroid, it is unclear why the Space Pirates insist on warring with the Galactic Federation, though it would seem to be a simple matter of armed rebels not liking the space government. To that end, they’re essentially really evil Browncoats. Not that the Federation is overly concerned with peace and tranquility, mind you. In Metroid II they deploy Samus Aran to commit genocide against the Metroid species, the latter deemed too dangerous to be allowed to live and thus possibly fall into the hands of the Space Pirates. (Just to emphasize the point, the poor Metroids are sentient and capable of loyalty, as later demonstrated in Super Metroid. The Galactic Federation ordered their total annihilation.

They quickly conquered Mars, Venus, and Earth, and operated with the philosophy that, as a genetic master race, they had the right to suppress and enslave humanity, their former oppressors.

In Fusion they had an entire section of the BSL dedicated to breeding Metroids for use in exactly the same way as the Space Pirates. Also the entire plot of Metroid Fusion is centered around how bad an idea it was to commit genocide against the Metroids. If anything the series is morally gray.

But that was in the 80's, now one would be hard-pressed to see him as anything other than a Republican lap-dog. But I guess the bourgeois press don't really have a solid grasp of the political spectrum anyway."

CommunismWorldwide,34tphp,Adahn5,7,Mon May 4 14:06:27 2015 UTC,"A worthy criticism of Capitalist Imperialism, but LibSocRants, despite being a smart comrade, doesn't do nearly enough (if any) research on the Soviet Union and to what degree it was indeed Socialist. Here's some info for those who want to know:  From comrade /u/denversocialist:    Where exactly the workers DID have a say?    They had say inside the Soviets, the worker's councils, that sprung up as mass action increased. John Reed gives a good analysis of them in 1918:    The Soviet state is based upon the Soviets – or Councils – of Workers, and Peasants’ Soviets. These Councils – institutions so characteristic of the Russian Revolution – originated in 1905, when, during the first general strike of the workers, Petrograd factories and labour organisations sent delegates to a Central Committee...  THE SOVIET is based directly upon the workers in the factories and the peasants in the field. At first the delegates of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Soviets were elected according to rules which varied with the needs and population of various localities. In some villages the peasants chose one delegate for each fifty voters. Soldiers in garrison were given a certain number of delegates for each regiment, regardless of its strength; the army in the field, however, had a different method of electing their Soviets. As for the workers in the great cities, they soon found out that their Soviets became unwieldy unless the delegates were limited to one for each five hundred. In the same way, the first two All-Russian Congresses of Soviets were roughly based upon one delegate for each twenty five thousand voters, but in fact the delegates represented constituencies of various sizes.  Until February 1918 anybody could vote for delegates to the Soviets. Even had the bourgeoisie organised and demanded representation in the Soviets, they would have been given it. For example, during the regime of the Provisional Government there was bourgeois representation in the Petrograd Soviet – a delegate of the Union of Professional Men which comprised doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc...   Elections of delegates are based on proportional representation, which means that the political parties are represented in exact proportion to the number of voters in the whole city. And it is political parties and programmes which are voted for – not candidates. The candidates are designated by the central committees of the political parties, which can replace them by other party members. Also the delegates are not elected for any particular term, but are subject to recall at any time.   So we can see at some point the soviets had near complete control of their production. As to how the Soviet system degenerated into the bureaucracy it did, I recommend two talks from ""We Are Many"". The first is, ""Did Lenin lead to Stalin"" by Gillian Russom and the second is ""Lenin and the Debate on Leninism"" by Paul LeBlanc. They both draw heavily from Victor Serge's ""From Lenin to Stalin"".   From comrade /u/MasCapital:   While not ideal (nothing is), there were many opportunities and avenues for worker participation in production. Check out this chapter which was published in this utterly mainstream Soviet history book.  I will reproduce some key passages here.   Former Soviet workers sometimes described their situation in the late 1930s using terms that support the view of their peers as fear-ridden slaves. Virtually all of the twenty-six emigre factory workers or employees interviewed by J.K. Zawodny in the early 1950s said that they had been afraid to complain about anything. For instance, a former coal miner spoke of 'this horrible fear of being arrested'. Many analyses of the period rest upon such generalizations, but in fact this is only the beginning of the story, for the very same people who made these statement sometimes offered specific evidence from their own experiences which undermines their general observations. Were this inquiry a legal trial, any court would rule that the second kind of evidence (if the first is really evidence at all) is considerably mroe important.  Stalin emphasized the importance of the party's 'ties to the masses'. To maintain them, it was necessary 'to listen carefully to the voice of the masses, to the voice of rank and file members of the party, to the voice of the so-called 'little people', to the voice of ordinary folk [narod]'. The party newspaper Pravda went so far as to identify lack of criticism with enemies of the people: 'Only an enemy is interested in seeing that we, the Bolsheviks... do not notice actual reality... only an enemy... strives to put the rose-coloured glasses of self-satisfaction over the eyes of our people.'  Besides offering informal verbal criticisms and writing to newspapers, workers utilized other means of  expressing dissatisfaction. First, they could go to the Rate and Conflicts Commissions (RKKs) within each factory to challenge decisions regarding pay, job classification or dismissal. These bodies had an equal number of representatives from the employer and from the factory or shop union committee. If workers failed to win their cases at that level, they could appeal to the people's courts or to the central committees of their unions... [L]abour unions, usually pronounced all but dead by this time in Western literature, in fact had some power to act on workers' behalf. Other examples of the same point will be given below.  Workers participated by the hundreds of thousands in special inspectorates, commissions, and brigades which checked the work of managers and institutions. These agencies sometimes wielded substantial power. For instance, the former worker turned inspector V.R. Balkan, together with a union official, investigated an accident at his Moscow factory in 1937. Finding the cause in improper testing of materials, the two fined the head of the production shop 100 roubles, about a week's pay, and placed a reprimand in the foremand's record. The book which recounted this story was published as a guide to action for other union officials and inspectors and therefore also encouraged similar action by workers.  The Stakhanovite movement was not a crude bludgeon used to beat all workers into vastly greater production, despite the drive to raise norms. However, it did accomplish something else for the industrial labour force which was of grave importance. The movement provided new status for workers in voicing criticism, urging and even demanding changes in production processes, and getting supervisors' attention in general. New forums appeared in which Stakhanovites could speak out, while some old and weak mechanisms for input now revived.  Worker enthusiasm was essential to boosting productivity. In order to help whip up zeal, the party leaders were quite willing to encourage workers to speak out; workers needed to feel that the Stakhanovite movement was theirs in a meaningful way. Therefore with Stalin, Molotov, and other top officials sitting behind him, Izotov was blunt:   Stakhanovites spoke to me and asked me to convey the following to the government: they earn a lot, but there is little to buy. One says: I need a piano, another - a bicycle, a third, a record player, radio and all sorts of cultural goods, which are necessary, but which are not [available] in Donbass.   [P]robably recognizing that repression was only likely to spread discontent, in March 1936 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the USSR announced a change in policy: 'In many cases courts have incorrectly judged individual backward workers as enemies of the people for incorrect remarks', the Presidium reported. In its view such statements often reflected the workers' inability to cope with the new conditions; this is, some workers could not make the new norms. Their negative remarks do not 'indicate their opposition to the Stakhanovite movement or sabotage'. What was needed was not court action but 'mass explanatory work'. In other words, workers were not to be punished for speaking against the movement; instead, managers and other officials were directed to help discontented workers master the new standards.  While sane, calm, and sober, no worker would have dared to say that socialism was a poor system or that Stalin was an idiot. But such bounds allowed a great deal that was deeply significant to workers, including some aspects of production norms, pay rates and classifications, safety on the job, housing, and treatment by managers. This occurred at a time when American workers in particular were struggling for basic union recognition, which even when won did not provide much formal influence at the work place.  Far from basing its rule on the negative means of coercion, the Soviet regime in the late 1930s fostered a limited but positive political role for the populace... [A]t lower levels of society, in day-to-day affairs and the implementation of policy, [the Soviet political structure] was participatory. Earlier concepts of the Soviet state require rethinking: the workers who ousted managers, achieved the imprisonment of their targets and won reinstatement at factories did so through organizations which constituted part of the state apparatus and wielded state powers."

This is not to subtract from his video, which was excellent and I realize that to go on at length on every topic he was refuting would take hours, but it is important to point out still more flaws in the video he was picking apart.   For example, while LibSocRants does point out that the US wasn't drawn into WWI by anti-fascist ideology (which is quite correct) he only points to competition with US interests as the reason for US entry.  Actually the story is far more convoluted than that.  The UK had actually set up what we would consider today as a psy-op to convince the US that it would be better off throwing it's military in with England than anyone else.  This propaganda campaign was largely successful especially on the American political elite who then launched their own campaign based off the English one in order to convince the American public to go to war, a massive part of which was the Lusitania incident (a incident that those in power had counted on occurring, or some similar too it).  There are many other reasons as well, but that has been cited by many historians as the largest for US entry.   Additionally LibSocRants lets the the propaganda film lay the blame for WWI squarely on ""Prussian military aggression and imperialism.""  This has been the go to propaganda lie for the Brits since the beginning of the war, and was of course quite ridiculous.  WWI occurred do the the failure of the Westphalia system in Europe and the rise of alliances, as well as a long string of extremely intertwined and unfortunate events occurring in a very specific order.  In fact it was English aggression alone that brought England and then the US into the conflict, when the Brits decided to honor a treaty no one expected them too (not even the German high command, in fact they were counting on the English not doing so otherwise they would have avoided Belgium) and entered the war to ""defend"" Belgium as a pretext for seizing German colonial holdings.   As far as the German government being ""proto-fascist"" they actually had the furthest left leaning domestic government in all of Europe at the time, with their heads of state and military leadership being the majority of the dogmatic conservative imperialists.  Indeed England and France at the time could be viewed as being far more ""proto-fascist"" in my areas."

The only thing preventing her from direct expulsion is ""her religion,"" then she went on to hear my thoughts about Hitler, and effectively called me Hitler. I was impressed by her stupidity, by the fact that she had dug for herself a comfortable grave in doing this. I am not insulted by her calling me Hitler, I care not the claims of idiots about me."

A more compelling explanation is that when globalization struck at the jobs on which 20th-century America had built its middle class, the United States discovered that it did not have much of a welfare state to speak of.

CommunismWorldwide,345t2a,lovelybone93,4,Tue Apr 28 15:50:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Although the American Revolution was a bourgeois one; I've been reading the People's History of the United States—and how the American colonies were producing millions of British pounds worth of profits for the English, that they decided to revolt in order to stop giving it to them. The decision, however, was not a proletarian one, but one of the burgeoning Capitalist landowners who were turning mad profits from exploiting slaves, black and white, and wanted to continue expanding westward. They were the ones, in fact, who wanted to slaughter the Indians and finish taking their land after the English had made a deal to leave them alone following the French and Indian war.  But I digress. Too many people have drunk the kool-aid of Pacifism. Just yesterday I was talking to a friend who asked me if I liked violence, and why the Revolution would have to be violent. And I said ""Yeah because Capitalism isn't violent. It doesn't maintain it's global hegemony through constant wars, famine and destitute homelessness. 3.1 Million kids a year die from starvation, every year, as a direct cause of the Capitalist Market system of distribution. But a Revolution to end it is too violent. Best leave things as they are, I guess."

If there's one thing I've learned in my short time on the planet; you don't try to reason with an attacker to stop attacking you, you either incapacitate/kill the attacker or get help from others that can help.  The only reason the US is #1 currently is because of the exploitation of the proletariat, of indigenous peoples, of endless war waged against foreign nations, death, homelessness and the whip of hunger that is ever present in capitalist society.  I swear, the people preaching pacifism are making me lean more to Marxism-Leninism."

I know that sexism has made it unacceptable for me to show weakness, compassion, feelings other than indifference or rage (my emotional range is stunted anyways), that because I'm a big strong man, I'm not supposed to have PTSD because a feeemale tried killing me, that seeking help puts me on par with a woman, while women are considered weak."

Similarly, even today despite being a conscious, reasoning, and (I like to think) intelligent person, I feel as less of a ""man"" by not being able to bring in money to support my parents. For most of my life I've quite literally been unable to do so because of my diplomatic status—in the US it stops you from getting a SSN, a Work Permit, or residency status of any kind because you're unable to pay taxes, get a line of credit, anything.  It's only now that the status has become void and I'm going back to the US as a Student rather than a diplomat, that I'm able to work; but I lived 6 years in the US without being able to contribute once except for the odd jobs I performed that I was paid under the table for."

But yes, it's easy to lump people in the same category when you don't give two shits about them. I had a class mate in college who would do that to all Black people. He'd see an African-American and say ""holy shit that's Morgan Freeman."" Or go to the movies and point out how many roles ""Morgan Freeman"" was in.  It pissed me off. I stopped hanging out with the douche. How'd he like it if everyone referred to Hispanics as ""George Lopez"".  Anyway, the racism I was subjected to when in school, growing up, was relatively benign. It was on the level of ""you're Mexican?"" To which I'd say ""Yeah."" To be followed by: ""But... you're white o.O"".  Oh for fuck sake, yes we come in all colours, sizes, shapes and flavours."

Your classmate was an asshat, he thought of all black people as Morgan Freeman? That's fucked up on so many levels.  I had the same deal as you in HS on racism, but replace Mexican with Puerto Rican.   As for white Mexicans, they're not uncommon, just look at Saúl (Canelo) Álvarez, FFS.   I look totally white as well, only reason people can tell I'm Hispanic is because of my surname and that I speak Spanish relatively fluently."
CommunismWorldwide,34415f,sillandria,2,Tue Apr 28 14:44:45 2015 UTC,"Any time any cops get the in trouble of any kind, I'm happy. I'm still interested in seeing protesters organise into a much more coherent force and using counter-phalanx tactics to take out the blocks of cops. We underestimate how human they are, how capable of feeling fear they are, and how much a crowd of belligerent protesters can terrify them. We should use that to our advantage, press them, hit them from both sides; have small units of militants and black bloc insurrectionists flank them from alleys. Anything to destroy their cohesion and break their spirit.  I was just in Mexico City, to return again, and I was thinking about the protests in the square and against the government. I thought of how misguided the protests were that burned down the historical gate; and how much more efficient and effective it would have been if they would have marched those thousands of people to Las Lomas, or to another one of the extremely rich neighbourhoods where the Capitalists live.  Can you imagine the pants-shitting fear those rich bastards with their polo shirts, sweater-vests, country-club going arses would feel if they saw ten thousand angry people at their gates communities? Pulling open the gates with their bare hands, the thousands strong just prying them open and doing what we've always done in our history since ancient times; get retribution on the oppressors?  Oh they'd all be calling their friends in the government to send in the army. Which is more than they did when the protests were in the square. This whole ""it's the government!"" stuff is only a half truth; and any time I see anti-state protests I wait for an anti-capitalist component.

If at some point the economy really gets bad, Chavez’s popularity within the country will certainly decrease and it’s the one weapon we have against him to begin with and which we should be using, namely the economic tools of trying to make the economy even worse so that his appeal in the country and the region goes down … Anything we can do to make their economy more difficult for them at this moment is a good thing, but let’s do it in ways that do not get us into direct conflict with Venezuela if we can get away with it.”   So they purposefully ruin the economy, then claim that economic system doesn't work.

Oliver considers himself fortunate for only requiring food stamps, something that has become a fact of life for many adjunct professors.  Oliver states, “It’s completely insane. And this isn’t happening just to me. More and more people are doing it. We have food stamps. We wouldn’t be able to survive without them.

Because of obviously you need to be poor to be a Socialist, and of course envious and a victim of crab mentality to criticise Capitalism. But wait, there's more! If you're rich like Russell Brand, then you get called a hypocrite, a class traitor, etc etc. So there's no pleasing those fucks.

Since coming to Queretaro I've of course seen the usual signs of Mexico's liberal democracy; a hundred and one posters, spray-painted logos, billboards and placards of the political parties (PRI, PAN, Partido Verde and PRD) out and about town. The encouraging part, though, after several conversations with cabbies, shop keeps, carpenters, plumbers and others that I've been in contact with, people are surprisingly conscious of the fact that none of the parties do anything for them.  They're keenly aware that there's no change, that it's the same shit as always, and that their lot in life doesn't improve. Some of them will tell you that ""Yeah this party did this thing, that one did that"", but overall the changes they promise and subsequently deliver are lacking and insignificant at best; downright nonexistent at worse. I know it's a little weird to call that a victory, but the recognition that things are shit by such a preponderance of people (and granted it was only a dozen people that I spoke to) but it was encouraging that they're ready for a genuine alternative that will change the economic system altogether.  There's still much of a servile mentality, though. A lot of ""well the Boss is the boss, and he brought his Capital, so I guess it's right that he should call the shots. But damn it I bring my labour, I should at least get something"". And I'm not making it up, that's almost word-for-word what a cabbie told me just yesterday.  Now for the rant. It's not much of a rant, it's mostly just a very disappointing, very sad and somewhat crushing back and forth I had on Twitter. At first it was fine, since it was with a douchebag calling himself ""BitchyGayGuy"", a reactionary scumbag. But things took a turn for the worse when Jimmy Dore, a comedian I actually like and who's book I even bought several months ago when it first came out, joined in—doubled down, and defended the fuck.  You can read the full exchange here. I regret sticking my foot in my mouth with the homosexual comment, I genuinely didn't think I was in the wrong but I saw the source and I acknowledged it. I don't know if recognising something and changing equals ""getting owned"", I've stuck my foot in it before and have always owned up to it. But anyway, that's pretty much it.

That said, it doesn't have the kind of oppressive history as does faggot, sissy, fairy, cocksucker, etc. It is quite literally descriptive.   And just to point it out, I see us queers as sharing a special camaraderie with females, as the nature of our oppression is almost always linked with patriarchal morality and gender construction.

CommunismWorldwide,32xr45,lovelybone93,6,Fri Apr 17 20:19:33 2015 UTC,"Solidarity comrade. It's the divisive nature of Capitalism to make us go after one another on the basis of ethnicity, religion, sex and sexual preference. The fact of the matter is that considering the amount of wealth we produce as a species, every single one of us who might be unemployed or out of work doesn't need to work, and could live off whatever is being produced collectively. The specious notion that we all need to earn a living, that our worth is measured by whether or not we're engaged in labour, is a Capitalist propaganda tool both to spur productivity forward and maintain a reserve army of labour that keeps labour as their commodity, cheap.  Frankly, even if you could take every single add soliciting workers, and fill it with every unemployed person out there, yeah you'd have no vacancies in employment, but you'd still have millions of unemployed people. That's because full employment for everyone in the world while doable, would in the end entail the creation of unproductive jobs.  What we need to do is change the system so that not only are we decide what to do with the surplus ourselves, but we can then use that surplus to maintain those of us among us who need not work—which we already do. As you said, the way their parents maintain those children is precisely that. We decide what to do with our surplus all the time, and the Capitalist redistributive strategy which recognises the unequal distribution of wealth, fuels divisiveness and conflict.  The liberal sees unequally and thinks 'tax the rich, then give the poor unemployment money'. The Socialist should think 'distribute wealth more equally from the start and avoid the whole mess to begin with.'

And the child sex trafficking is a huge problem in Vegas and the rest of Nevada since IIRC, this is the only US state to have legalized prostitution.

CommunismWorldwide,32w4om,lovelybone93,3,Fri Apr 17 05:14:25 2015 UTC,"Indeed. The 'legalised prostitution' thing is pretty muddy. Whatever one's position is on it, the legalising of it doesn't stop the fact that it's the commodification of women, and their subsequent exploitation. The added fact that it entices, rather than stops, illegal sex trafficking is horror that's often overlooked. Often coerced into claiming that they're entering prostitution legally, there's no recourse for women that were forced sex slavery."
CommunismWorldwide,32w4om,lovelybone93,2,Fri Apr 17 05:28:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and this is only regarding the legal brothels/prostitutes (making up only 10% of the prostitution here in Nevada, since it's illegal in Clark (Vegas) and Washoe (Reno) counties, the major population centers, 90% of prostitution is of the illegal variety with worse exploitation by pimps.)  The legal brothels are in very sparsely populated areas, so the women can't really escape (and the madams know exactly what the women make since they bug each room.)  It's strange that women are perceived as of less worth than men, yet are commodified in this way. Women's sexuality is repressed, men's sexuality vaunted.   But for some reason men command almost no ""sexual value"" (I hate using terms from TRP) and women command sexual value (you don't see guys on escort ads, do you?) when both men and women want to indulge in our baser instincts (fucking.)

Also the fact that people think that women are too emotional for combat and that they wouldn't be able to handle it. This may have the practical effect of making men seem disposable but I do not think that is the reason why they do the most fighting. All you have to do is see anybody try to defend the idea that women shouldn't be in the combat to see how many negative stereotypes are brought up about women.   Is this a real biological thing or only cultural? There definitely is some kind of difference as evidenced by prostitution but I couldn't tell you what to make of it.

CommunismWorldwide,32w4om,sillandria,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:47:50 2015 UTC,"But for some reason men command almost no ""sexual value"" (I hate using terms from TRP) and women command sexual value (you don't see guys on escort ads, do you?) when both men and women want to indulge in our baser instincts (fucking.)   Women do not command anything. Our society sees them as collections of attractive body parts and not as subjects. Men are considered to have agency (subject), women are considered to be passive (object), so it is men that are expected to make the first move. So sexual value is not commanded by women, but is imposed by men."
CommunismWorldwide,32w4om,lovelybone93,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:58:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I stand corrected. I don't think that women are objects, but seems much easier for women to find a sexual partner than guys. (Again, not trying to be an ass, I've just seen this while at bars and clubs with women having no problem hooking up compared to guys.) IDK, I was drunk when typing the previous statement. I have a hard time approaching women to even talk to them unless I'm drunk, so it's not a boon for me to be expected to make the first move. Thanks for checking me before I wrecked myself, comrade."

This is a complicated thing. Basically, if you are considered not-attractive by society then finding a sexual partner is hard, period. With women it can be harder since women are expected to allow men to make the first move. If you are an unattractive guy you can move from woman to woman until you find one. If you are an unattractive women then you have less options. This is changing in that it is becoming more acceptable for women to make the first move but it is still an issue. If you are an attractive women then you have the opposite problem: too many assholes who are only interested in you for your body. Kinda like how it is easier for a rich person to get ""friends"": these friends can often times only be interested in you for your money whereas men can often times only be interested in a women for her body. Witness cat-calling as an example.   This is not an absolute though. There are good guys who actually do care about women as people and there are also women who are shallow assholes who just want to fuck, but the overall social relations tend to favor the men as subjects women as objects problem where even despite individual beliefs it can be hard to fight the casual sexism that pervades everyday social interaction."

Any organisation you had, from a ticket of someone like a Warren or a Kucinich, would end up as a Social Democratic reformist shtick that would still leave the Capitalists in charge of all the corporations and all the money.  If we did take a CPUSA/SPUSA etc, or some new left version that sought revolutionary change on the Syriza or Podemos calibre of things, and make those baby steps (old arse baby though xD) maybe something might get done. It would have to be a synthesis of parties and groups, the OWS, the ML groups, all the revolutionary, anti-capitalist groups would need to get together and then build a platform to and coordinate their activity.  Problem is you need money to do it. And the people most likely to lead the country to revolutionary change are too busy working their asses off. That's exactly how the Capitalists want it, of course. A population too busy working to take the time to inform themselves on the political goings on, to be active in a party, or to engage in direct action to push for social and economic change.  What I would do, if I had the means, would be to gather all of us up. Call on every comrade in the US and say ""We're going to see to it that you can quit your job and dedicate yourself 100% into this."" And have the funding to do it, to be able to pay for let's say, you Bones, to move to wherever we set up our HQ, and have everyone take a monthly stipend to live on plus provide for their families. And then launch ourselves.  Some of us go to these cities, some of go to those cities. We connect with local parties, with local groups, we go to Universities, Churches, Unions, whatever and we tell them what we're doing, we foster cohesion and pull the disjointed branches of the Social left with the Economic left and then we march.  We block the streets, we make our voices not those of bullhorns, but of fucking red and black lions to scare the living shit out of the Wall Street and the White House. We perform general strikes, we occupy our workplaces, we shut down schools and train terminals, airports and harbours, we grab the Capitalists by the loose flesh of their neck and headbutt them hard enough to break their noses with our proletarian forehead.  And then we tell them that we're changing things. We're not asking, we're not demanding, we're making it happen.

I have to ask what you mean by conservatism here because to me that's the whole world over.   ...the imperialism...   That's just capitalism.

Social fascism describes something that is socialist in name, but in practice are not socialist at all or even fascist in nature. Syriza isn't interested in telling the Germany to shove it but instead want to collaborate with them. As the KKE shows here and what this article shows is how Syriza used radical rhetoric to take advantage of a desperate proletariat in order to get elected. This is why they are social fascist.   Lenin himself supported inclusiveness in the Revolution.   That doesn't contradict what I said. We can have a million different parties and still not be exclusive.   He deliberately spoke out against alienating other, similarly-minded people, such as Christian Socialists.   He also tirelessly waged line struggle with the Mensheviks in the RSLDP and the revisionists in the Second International. It also wasn't until the Bolsheviks split with the Mensheviks that the First World Communist Revolution took place (I don't really mean to say that one caused the other, just pointing it out).   What exactly is the correct line, are you talking about calibration, and a synthesizing of ideology toward a single, unified goal or vision?   The correct line is the political position that is the right one to take. If all the socialists in the US were in the same party, it would necessarily result in revisionism and opportunism because splitting, when it itself is a the correct line, keeps parties from being opportunist.  Open line struggle within parties and between parties is necessary to come to a correct line. If we're all together trying not to alienate eachother, or we tolerate revisionists and liberals in the party, by definition we can't come to a correct line."
