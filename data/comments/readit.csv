readit,3e3bbg,Timeworm,2,Tue Jul 21 17:08:51 2015 UTC,Fixed it in the latest update. Check for updates.

readit,3e16ts,tinyspaceape,3,Tue Jul 21 04:09:05 2015 UTC,I'll fix our javascript favorite in the next update. I don't know how it broke but I forgot about it.

readit,3du3g4,ThePepperAlx,3,Sun Jul 19 14:16:05 2015 UTC,Thanks! I kept looking for it in the browsing section and just assumed it wasn't there. Your comment made me go through them all.
readit,3du3g4,ThePepperAlx,3,Sun Jul 19 14:26:06 2015 UTC,No problem! Glad I could help
readit,3dinrl,onedrummer2401,3,Thu Jul 16 16:07:06 2015 UTC,Only if you have reddit gold.
readit,3dinrl,calebkeith,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:27:17 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I figured.

readit,3d1ttj,Aschker,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:18:04 2015 UTC,I was getting this as well. Just redownload the app and you should be able to log in.

Try flipping that switch in settings to see if it fixes it."

I still have no idea how things happened but at least they should be fixed with this update. The ""test"" IAP is working on my devices with the debug build, the real world scenario is just a guessing game :/ hopefully that works this time."

Mistakes are frequent in life and we cant assume that developing what I presume is, a ridiculously intricate app would be exempt from that.   And honestly, even with the hiccups ive experienced since the last update its still my go to. Get better!"
