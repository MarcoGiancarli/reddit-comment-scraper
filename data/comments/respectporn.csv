respectporn,39c6wc,Kshaja,6,Thu Jun 11 18:39:40 2015 UTC,"There's an off chance that you will roll over in your sleep and smother the infant, considering most parents with infants that age are sleep deprived there's a pretty decent chance that you won't wake up until it's too late.  Even with 0.1% possibility of that happening I suggest avoiding it while baby is younger then 6 months. Also there is SIDS to consider."
respectporn,39c6wc,dobx,8,Fri Jun 12 06:01:35 2015 UTC,"To be honest this isn't really CPR and the police officer didn't really actually help, but it's still nice he tried. You can see the child's muscles tensing in the video which means a seizure was probably what caused her to stop breathing. CPR would be used if the child was in cardiac arrest. Even if this was the case, the officer isn't even using chest compressions which are far more important than the mouth to mouth. So yeah this child would have been fine whether the officer intervened or not."
respectporn,39c6wc,FluxxxCapacitard,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:55:25 2015 UTC,"FWIW, it's worth mentioning that infants and children are far more likely to be in respiratory distress rather than cardiac arrest.  And in which case, the breaths he was giving would have actually been useful.    Which is actually why BLS/infant CPR teaches the lower 15:2 ratio for 2 person infant CPR.  Because of the higher likelihood that respiratory distress is the real problem, and getting a pulse on a child in the field is rather difficult for a novice.  So they would prefer you double up on the breathing just in case.    The video wasn't clear as to whether the pulse was evaluated, so it's hard to tell if he got a pulse and determined simply lack of breathing was the issue.  (Or other symptoms, blue lips and fingernails, etc.)  In which case his course of action would have been textbook correct rescue breathing / BLS.    But technically, you are correct in the ""CPR"" statement.  He performed rescue breathing, not cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  Saying he was unhelpful is incorrect, as the video did not show what was necessary to determine that.  It very likely could have prevented or minimized brain damage had the child been in respiratory distress."
respectporn,39c6wc,dobx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:48:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you're trying to say with your first two paragraphs. As I mentioned this is not a cardiac arrest but most likely a seizure. In the case of a seizure you are wrong with your final two paragraphs. In my experience we would never perform rescue breathing on a patient in the middle of a seizure, you would simply place them in the recovery position and wait for breathing to resume. Only after the seizure would you need rescue breathing if it didn't return to normal. Some quick googling found these websites, both of which are reputable, to support the point that you should not use rescue breathing during the seizure.  WebMD  Epilepsy.com"

respectporn,35akn4,Dakrys,23,Fri May 8 15:52:38 2015 UTC,If they can pass the tests then I see no reason why they shouldn't be included.
respectporn,35akn4,dog_in_the_vent,9,Fri May 8 16:04:46 2015 UTC,"I think the point of the discussion is that women have lighter physical requirements for the military. Which raises the question about the purpose of the testing in the first place.   If a man needs to, say, lift 100lbs to join and a woman needs to lift, say 80, are the men gated too high or are the women gated too low?   To be honest I think it has more to do with goal setting and discipline than the objective goal, and if you set the goal in the same place you'd have some men pass the initial screening who don't have particularly good discipline just because it's easier for men to build strength than women."
respectporn,35akn4,Dakrys,13,Fri May 8 16:36:58 2015 UTC,"You'd think the lifting requirement would be whichever is higher (men's requirement obviously) just due to the fact that if a person was ever hurt and needed to be dragged to safety I'd want someone, man or woman, who was physically capable of doing it.  It may not be fair that its harder for women to reach that requirement, but when its the difference between life or death for the person next to you, ""fairness"" shouldn't be considered."
respectporn,35akn4,dog_in_the_vent,-1,Fri May 8 16:41:11 2015 UTC,"Could be but if you set it too high it becomes too hard for women to join and you might honestly not need that much strength.   I still see it like standardised testing. They aren't looking for the ""smart"" kids, they're looking for the kids with work ethic."
respectporn,35akn4,Dakrys,11,Fri May 8 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"If a woman is not capable of dragging a 200 lb wounded soldier around, and that has been determined to be a prerequisite to serving in combat, that woman should not be expected/allowed to serve in combat."

respectporn,35akn4,dog_in_the_vent,0,Fri May 8 19:40:38 2015 UTC,I dont think its outrageous to require soldiers who are going to actually be in positions that may involve needing to physically move another soldier in the heat of battle to be physically capable of doing it.  Obviously just gotta have different standards for roles that wont be in that situation. Recruit/Officer not going to be in the field? Lower the physical requirements accordingly.

At least that's what I got from both of your comments."
respectporn,35akn4,AnnaNetrebko,1 point,Fri May 8 19:37:34 2015 UTC,I guess I don't know what your point is exactly? You're saying it should be enough that they're willing to take the test? What am I missing here? I don't see what you're trying to say.
respectporn,35akn4,dog_in_the_vent,-2,Fri May 8 19:28:10 2015 UTC,"Boot camp is as much, if not more, about mental strength, discipline, and ability to submit to orders than anything else. So yes, the point is that she took the test and pushed herself to the limit. Her physical strength is not as important. The times when a woman's physical strength would be the limiting factor on real situations is negligible. It is more important to have her there, fighting alongside you even if she's marginally weaker physically."
respectporn,35akn4,ronglangren,6,Fri May 8 20:21:05 2015 UTC,The times when a woman's physical strength would be the limiting factor on real situations is negligible.   Just because she's mentally capable of pushing her body to its limits doesn't mean she can complete her role in combat if her body is not physically capable of doing so.
respectporn,35akn4,dog_in_the_vent,3,Fri May 8 23:28:20 2015 UTC,"In this specific instance, I agree. Its not a an application test, its a voluntary test she willingly took and wanted to complete. And absolute props to her, she definitely earned the respect of her peers.  I guess the discussion I thought we were having was should we make the physical requirements to be admitted into a the Army/Navy/Marines. I absolutely don't think someone should be allowed onto a battlefield unless you've proven you can pull your weight, no pun intended. No more would I want to have a man who can't carry his equipment, himself or god forbid me if need be, than I would want a woman who can't do it. Nothing to do with sexism or anything, it just doesn't make sense to allow someone in due to fairness when it could cost someone their life. If a woman can pass the same physical requirements that a man has to, then I have zero problem with them being there, because I know shed be able to pull my ass outta the fire the same way I could pull her out."

If you're going to be in a position that may require lifting in a life or death situation, you should meet a pretty damn strict standard.

respectporn,35akn4,ALIVEtobeDEAD,4,Fri May 8 18:36:40 2015 UTC,It matters because there are. 14 women passed that test that day. Why wasn't it 100 or a thousand? Those women are out there. The problem is that the Army does not heavily recruit women. It doesn't even want them. And frankly (since you wanted a frank discussion) it is precisely attitudes like yours that do not help.

respectporn,34qcpj,sample_material,2,Mon May 4 19:14:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah it sucks. You call 911. Hopefully they get the victim separated from the abuser and given that opening hopefully the victim will take it (not always). It is also the reason for the laws that state a person who is arrested for domestic  violence many times can not contact the person they were violent towards for 24-76 hours, because in that time it helps the person to calm down from the situation and allow the victim to also feel free of the person where if they were ambivalent about getting help at first maybe having some time away will make them try calling the domestic violence case worker who's number they were given, or find time to move out.  It is not a good situation at all and a lot of options are limited. But if the guy was hitting on the woman in the restaurant like the one guy was saying, then sure you might scare the guy by screaming and threatening him... but what happens after he or the group inevitably leaves the restaurant? Suddenly she is all alone again with the guy (who is now livid) with nobody to protect her and at the very least no documentation that the incident took place. At least if the police are called and nothing is done besides documenting that he allegedly was hitting her... that can be helpful down the road when 2, 3, or 7 more incidents like that get documented and then she finally decides to get an order of protection filed the judge will look and see the history and it will help her case that much further."

The cops showed up (patrolling for some other reason) and they proceeded to do everything that could to pin something else on him.

THey both got in the situation, he put himself in a crappy situation. But this is not cut and dry, and he did not just attack someone for no reason.  Like the Ray Rice video.

But you're the dumb ass picking a fight with the 6'0""+ 200+lb NFL player. You really should know better, and I have no sympathy if you write a check your ass can't cash.  The NFL is overreacting to anything remotely to do with domestic violence because it makes them bad, and they have money at stake to look like they care. And so even grey areas, situations where the man HAS LITERALLY NOT COMMITTED A CRIME ACCORDING TO LAW is being raked over the coals so the NFL can score PR points. And it's easy for a talking head pundit to jump on that wagon to score easy PR points too.  Dale Hansen is full of shit."

Although I'll shut up about women being treated as fragile when the same sentiment is shared for a small guy getting stomped by a large guy.

There is a difference between beating your wife/girlfriend, and beating up someone (man or woman) who is antagonizing you physically. Sure there would still be the white knights, but, thankfully, many people tend to agree with the concept of self defence against any threat, regardless of gender.  That being said, yeah, short/small dudes get way less sympathy than women when they get beat up. It's a huge double standard."

With all professions, you want to hire people who are the most likely to make you succeed. You see this disassociation in many different other areas of popular culture as well. Chris Brown made national news when he was arrested for the same thing as Hardy, and while I don't personally like his music, the fact that he's an asshole shouldn't stop people from enjoying his music.

The DS immediately pulled him in to the hall way, and took me, because in basic you have to go in pairs everywhere.  While still maintaining the stern professional DS manner, he tells the guy about the miscarriage his wife had and how he would be there if he needed to talk to him about it.

One of the funniest encounters for me is when I asked a guy whether he was the one that kicked my in the nuts with his cleats and he said ""Oh I got you good"".  So he got me a beer and I got him one. We are still buds."
respectporn,33q3jw,jhlim4,66,Fri Apr 24 16:07:29 2015 UTC,"Great awareness by the fighter. Watching it live, there was no way I could blame the ref for not getting in there sooner. The guys convulsions made it near impossible to tell he was out. Eyes open and arms seemingly ""reaching"" up at his opponent...Ref kinda got some shit for this, but he definitely didnt deserve it.  Respect to the winner for sure."
respectporn,33q3jw,Cavemansol,7,Fri Apr 24 16:17:40 2015 UTC,I don't know. Given the choke hold the ref should have been paying very close attention. You don't have to hold those long at all before you know the person is out.
respectporn,33q3jw,Pluckerpluck,3,Sat Apr 25 00:59:55 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty rare reaction to being choked though, very rarely do we see a guy convulse in a manner that's consistent with ""defending himself"". I'm gonna give the ref a break on THIS specific case."
respectporn,33q3jw,Cavemansol,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:42:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I don't know much about the rules of MMA fighting - is he actually physically choking the guy? Like, blocking his airway?

Sorry, I'm just really confused - not knocking the sport, just wondering."
respectporn,33q3jw,GlitterLamp,2,Thu May 7 12:39:35 2015 UTC,"So... This may sound more extreme, but he's cutting off blood to the brain.   This drops you unconscious in only a few seconds, and holding it for too long can kill (a few seconds vs 30+, so it's hard to get wrong if you've trained)   It's one of the safest ways to incapacitate an opponent if you know how to do it well. Do not try this yourself without a professional.   Edit: Often you tap out before this happens, but you really only have a few seconds to realize you can't break free and you're going to pass out. That's why it's important to be paying attention."
respectporn,33q3jw,Pluckerpluck,1 point,Thu May 7 13:01:19 2015 UTC,"Ah OK, so a hold like this would have to be precise, which I'd imagine is why it mostly happens on the ground.  I just had a vision in my head of two fighters trying to strangle each other and wondered why I never saw that happening. Thanks for the clarification!"
respectporn,33q3jw,GlitterLamp,2,Thu May 7 13:16:11 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Also this gif doesn't actually show the choke, it starts after he has let go of the choke, he is holding his hand on his neck to keep him in place to punch him, but he doesn't as he sees he is out.  I know this is old and stuff but im bored and wanted to clarify a little more. The martial art is known as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and it focuses all on chokes and joint locks in ground grappling, so are correct, 90% of the art is on the ground. all chokes except for a couple in BJJ are what is called blood chokes, which is done by blocking the carotid artery on each sides of the neck that give blood to the brain. What you were thinking of is called an air choke, which is closing off the windpipe and stopping breathing.  Blood chokes are near painless when applied as opposed to air chokes which are very painfully as it is crushing your windpipe. Blood chokes also put people out in a fraction of the time. An air choke takes as long as the person can hold their breath, which for some can be a long time. Blood chokes will put you out in about 6-8 seconds no matter how tough the person is, holding the choke for longer than that cause brain damage for every second, up to death if you hold for too long. A fighter can stop the other fighter from choking them at any point by admitting defeat and ""tapping out"" which is when a fighter takes his hand (or foot if his hands are not in a position to do it) and tap multiple times on the person or the mat, this is a sign of admitting defeat and in an MMA fight the ref will stop the fight right then and there.  DO NOT TRY THEM AT HOME IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. there have been cases with people with unhealthy arteries getting choked, then when the choke is released their arteries do not reopen, and they die. So again, do not try if you are not experienced."
respectporn,33q3jw,Recreant57,6,Sat May 23 19:34:16 2015 UTC,Yeah it definitely took me a couple watches to see he was out when the other fighter was on top of him.

respectporn,33q3jw,shatinahat,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:28:57 2015 UTC,"It isn't fencer's response because he wasn't knocked unconscious. He was choked unconscious (happened before the start of the gif).

It's utterly irresponsible for a referee, even in a smaller promotion, not to be familiar with, at a minimum, every technique that has ever ended a UFC fight.  There are only a few dozen techniques that hold this distinction, and it's a completely reasonable minimum library for a referee to know cold.  This was a dangerous failure."
respectporn,33q3jw,Cavemansol,5,Sat Apr 25 03:01:10 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstood what I said, the choke itself isn't so rare, its the reaction to the choke. The way his body reacted to being choked out isn't the norm.  The ref should absolutely understand and identify ALL chokes, but that's not where the confusion started here."
respectporn,33q3jw,jMyles,0,Sat Apr 25 03:14:36 2015 UTC,"But if someone has been subjected to a plausible choke for 8+ seconds, the prudent assumption is that they have succumbed to the technique, not vise-versa.  Then, on top of having made the incorrect assumption, to stand there and argue with the fighter who is pointing out that, lo and behold, a choke caused someone to lose consciousness, is utterly unprofessional and frankly disgusting.  I'm not saying this ref needs to retire, but he definitely needs additional training and grappling experience."

The ref disagrees twice before he just stands up and demonstrates how out the guy is.  This sparked a little discussion over at /r/mma. The ref's primary function is to protect both fighters. That means that in situations like this, he should have honestly noticed even before chad did in this case. When stuff like this normally happens you'll see much better refs getting way closer and hustling around. NORMALLY... a well trained ref will notice when someone is being choked out, which normally only takes 3-5 seconds before they tap or go limp where you call the fight. In this case by not taking the effort to watch carefully someone was able to be choked out literally with the ref just assuming he was fine."

I imagine he's giving people a look like, ""wtf is he asking me this for?""   You ask him about a specific quote from years ago that makes people think he's conservative, and how that relates to his time in prison. There's nothing inherently wrong about being a conservative but they're an easy group to strawman and hatefuck in the media.   This is a dude that had horrible experiences with drugs and addiction and has built himself out of it.   MAD props to RDJ for this. Not only did he give the interviewer a chance to get back on track without losing his cool, but he had the presence of mind to walk away before he said something that could hurt his project, reputation, or career.

He doesn't get answers because he keeps hammering on a question that has already been shut down, and just pisses off the interviewee and wastes a bunch of time trying to get an answer he obviously isn't going to get. An interviewer needs to be socially concious of the scenario, and this guy seems totally oblivious, and as a result seems to conduct bad interviews that don't generate answers.

It's the same old paparazzo tabloid bullshit that hurts real journalists every day.   If he wants to ask serious questions and veer off of the promotional topic, that's perfectly fine. It's not even an uncommon thing to do even in promotion interviews. But what this dude was doing was rude, greedy, and just straight up sloppy.   I could be wrong but I imagine it's considered good form to tell your interviewee which topics you're going to be asking him about before the cameras are rolling to get a few thumbs up/down.

Sorry, but Channel 4 news does not exist to be part of Robert Downey Junior's publicity machine - and I do not watch Channel 4 news to see such publicity. As it happens, I am not that interested in celebrity interviews at all, but if I am going to watch them, I might as well see ones that get behind the press handout for the movie/ book/ record/ whatever. If RDJ wants the Kudos of appearing on a serious news outlet, he should accept that he is going to face some tougher questions, if he does not want that, he should stick to the lightweight stuff and accept that some people will look on that much the same was as they look on allegedly serious politicians avoiding the heavyweight interviewers but going on Mumsnet or Richard and Judy.  And, of course, the opposite goes for Guru-Murthy - I could not have much respect for a supposedly serious newsman who let himself be used for the purposes of the Downey Machine.  Of course, these things are tightly controlled - it would be amazing if there were not long discussions between C4 and the publicists beforehand about what might be off-topic, and sometimes, quite rightly, news organisations will decline to interview someone if they think that they are being subjected to unreasonable restrictions. I would be very surprised if it had been agreed in advance that such questions were off limits."

In this case, I think Krishnan was way out of line, and clearly desperate to take the interview into 'serious news' territory when it was completely uncalled for. Between incongruously trying to pigeonhole RDJ to a vague political ideology (as it's election season  in the UK), to asking questions that might have been relevant 6-8 years ago when Iron Man was taking off (re his personal 'redemption' story - which has been done to death by better and more respectful journalists), the interviewer was clutching at straws. I think he was taking a Jeremy Paxman approach when he really should have kept it light - maybe he'd been focusing on politics too closely.  That said, there's a purely professional aspect to consider too, as you rightly point out. The interview was really close to the end of the time slot when he called it a day, and I'm sure he had to answer many, many similar questions from a ton of other people.  In fact, it's probably worked out very well for both the film and Channel 4, let's face it."

If he already bought a house and isn't super materialistic, which he obviously isn't, it's not that big a deal to him.  I didn't expect him to go down to $70k a year, though.

As Steinbeck said, ""Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.""

Would you start living irresponsibly? Obviously not everyone would, but a lot of times these kinds of sudden income increases bring with them financial instability.   Worse, what if you started hating your job? What if it wasn't fulfilling. You start looking elsewhere, but you can't find a job for your skill set that pays nearly what you got at that company...  I don't mean to be a downer, but I wonder what the effect is with this since it's just one company doing it. It's not the industry as a whole or something similar."

If you truly hate the job and want a new start, there are sacrifices you're going to have to make.

respectporn,32ejx0,Griffy09,4,Mon Apr 13 05:29:49 2015 UTC,"I knew what fight you were talking about before I even reached that point in the video. It is easily the pinnacle of sportsmanship during a AMMA bout.   Both fighters are amateurs, so they aren't getting paid, don't have any sponsors and once they turn pro, their ammy records are forgotten - so basically they are fighting for the love of the sport and/or to get experience to turn pro.  The guy in the white trunks felt that he was far superior to the black trunks (which he was) and that the black trunks guy didn't train for their fight. So instead of sending the guy to the hospital over a fight that has no really meaning, he choose to instead end it. Saving the other fighter unnecessary injuries.  Really the ref should have realized this and ended the bout, but hats off to white trunks!"

The ""losing"" fighter was doing Mike a favor by fighting him when his original opponent dropped out at the last minute.  Mike didn't want to knock him out and he wasn't going to tap out, so Mike did it for him.  It didn't matter who officially won the fight, and it was clear that Mike would have won.  The referee wouldn't have stepped in because he wasn't seriously injured.  Both fighters were standing and continuing the fight."

respectporn,30kla8,y-snolla,4,Sat Mar 28 20:11:11 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that refs only stop the fight once the fighter demonstrates that they can't intelligently defend themselves. They allow for a recovery time because a lot of times a fighter will get stunned by a hit then be able to get back in the fight, which to me is what it looked like happened. Refs aren't supposed to stop fights just because one fighter is better than the other and will inflict more damage."
respectporn,30kla8,vegannurse,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:18:55 2015 UTC,I saw no intelligent defense other than holding up his hands.  The other guy landed every big blow that he threw.
respectporn,30kla8,TitoTheMidget,1 point,Sun Mar 29 04:34:29 2015 UTC,"While the guy was clearly getting rocked, there's no actual cause for stoppage here. A stoppage happens when someone is entirely unable to defend themselves. Occasionally it will get stopped due to a cut, but it's rare and it's got to be a pretty bad cut. This guy was bleeding, but he wasn't bleeding badly enough to stop the fight, and he was losing, but he was never defenseless."

respectporn,30kla8,Recreant57,0,Mon Mar 30 22:35:38 2015 UTC,"I know this threads like a month old but I can't stand seeing you so adamantly spew wrong information. Amateur bouts are refed differently than professional bouts. You obviously haven't watched a good amount of amateur MMA because this fight 100%. Should have been stopped. In a pro bout? No, but definitely in an amateur bout.  In amateur bouts no one is getting paid and your record doesn't matter. The second anyone starts taking overt punishment the ref should stop the fight in an amateur bout. Don't attack people for not knowing how things work when you don't either."
respectporn,30kla8,NoNations,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:55:13 2015 UTC,"This was a difficult decision. Is it more respectful to knock the opponent out let him lose honourably, or is it more respectful to spare him from physical harm and tap out? Personally I feel he should have finished the fight and left the choice to submit up to his opponent.  I can see myself doing the same thing though, wanting to take the humiliation for myself. I feel like the dishonour is on the organizers of the fight who are responsible for a poor match."
respectporn,30kla8,BWoodsn2o,5,Sat Mar 28 16:17:50 2015 UTC,I think the fact a lot of people are missing is that this was an amateur fight. These guys weren't being paid (or at the very leasy not much) to fight. The guy made a calculated decision to not potentially harm his opponent long term. He didn't feel that the event organizer would have provided money for medical costs either.   To have that kind of clarity of the thought in the moment is pretty amazing.

Where i work we had foam cups for the fountain drinks, free refills on those cups. we had a meeting where we discussed that refills are only allowed on our foam cups. somebody asked what should be done if customers keep going in with the same cup. our boss replied that the cups wont last with repeated use so it shouldnt be a issue. he was informed that a few customers would get cups from the trash and use those. Basically his response was if they go through all of that trouble for a drink then they can have it.   same goes with this, if a guy dresses in old ripped and smelly clothes just to get a free sandwich, then i dont think subway will give a shit unless it is something blatant like driving up in a mercedes."

Likewise respectporn suggests images stories or videos that depict ""respect"" in a manner so well done that we want to see it in every day use, hence the pleasure aspect.  thats just a guess.....so...guessporn?"

I guess it really depends on how you view the word. If you take it in a literal sense, then yes it is kinda silly. If you take in in the context like you put it, as something that is pleasurable or gives you good feelings to look at, then I see adding the word porn to something emphasizes the amount of pleasure one would receive from viewing something. Similar to when someone relates the taste of something to sex. ""Mmm its as good as sex"" or ""its better than an orgasm."" Sex is used as a comparison for pretty much everything."

When I'm on a bike I absolutely do not stop and put my foot down at every stop sign and red light (I'll get close in Manhattan though. Shits crazy). But I'll slow down look both ways for cars and people, and stop if I need to. No harm no foul for anyone.

Usually only one person per graduating class gets to have that advantage, so by allowing for multiple valedictorians, they're doing you all a huge favor.

AP exams are standard, end of the year exams in which universities offer college credit if you do well.

It was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher working at RAND in 1950. Albert W. Tucker formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and gave it the name ""prisoner's dilemma"" (Poundstone, 1992), presenting it as follows:   Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of speaking to or exchanging messages with the other. The prosecutors do not have enough evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge. They hope to get both sentenced to six months in prison on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a Faustian bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to: betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. Here is the offer:    If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves 2 years in prison If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve 3 years in prison (and vice versa) If A and B both remain silent, both of them will only serve 6 months in prison (on the lesser charge)   It is implied that the prisoners will have no opportunity to reward or punish their partner other than the prison sentences they get, and that their decision will not affect their reputation in the future. Because betraying a partner offers a greater reward than cooperating with them, all purely rational self-interested prisoners would betray the other, and so the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is for them to betray each other.  The interesting part of this result is that pursuing individual reward logically leads both of the prisoners to betray, when they would get a better reward if they both cooperated. In reality, humans display a systematic bias towards cooperative behavior in this and similar games, much more so than predicted by simple models of ""rational"" self-interested action.     A model based on a different kind of rationality, where people forecast how the game would be played if they formed coalitions and then they maximize their forecasts, has been shown to make better predictions of the rate of cooperation in this and similar games given only the payoffs of the game.   There is also an extended ""iterated"" version of the game, where the classic game is played over and over between the same prisoners, and consequently, both prisoners continuously have an opportunity to penalize the other for previous decisions. If the number of times the game will be played is known to the players, then (by backward induction) two classically rational players will betray each other repeatedly, for the same reasons as the single shot variant. In an infinite or unknown length game there is no fixed optimum strategy, and Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments have been held to compete and test algorithms.  The prisoner's dilemma game can be used as a model for many real world situations involving cooperative behaviour. In casual usage, the label ""prisoner's dilemma"" may be applied to situations not strictly matching the formal criteria of the classic or iterative games: for instance, those in which two entities could gain important benefits from cooperating or suffer from the failure to do so, but find it merely difficult or expensive, not necessarily impossible, to coordinate their activities to achieve cooperation.

While they never explicitly say it, I can't help but feel like it's trying to justify the Ferguson shootings, and I don't think it does a good job of that for two reasons:   The activist was clearly not trained in ANY de-escalation strategies.  A police officer should be skilled in talking people down, or restraining them without the use of their weapon. No one said it was easy.  But when you make a judgement call, you have to live with the consequences of that.  More importantly, when people are consistently making judgement calls that, in retrospect, weren't the right move, it's important to investigate the possibility of systemic flaws."
respectporn,2rromf,sirblastalot,1 point,Fri Jan 9 00:39:56 2015 UTC,They were justified though if you look through the evidence and stick to witnesses that didn't make things up that go against the evidence.

respectporn,2rromf,Plutoid,0,Thu Jan 8 19:50:28 2015 UTC,Can they not carry a taser and a gun? Obviously use the taser when the guy is approaching you fast and clearly not having a weapon. Use the gun and get in a covered position with the car jacker.
respectporn,2rromf,BoiledEggs,3,Thu Jan 8 21:06:27 2015 UTC,"Tazers have their own problems.  They can still kill people, but, because  they're perceived as less dangerous, you're much more likely to use it, even when not strictly necessary."
respectporn,2rromf,sirblastalot,0,Fri Jan 9 00:27:59 2015 UTC,Seems like something that could be solved with adequate training. Some cops already use guns when it's not strictly necessary.  Expecting the problem to go away without doing anything won't work.
respectporn,2rromf,conquer69,2,Fri Jan 9 00:41:21 2015 UTC,"could be solved with adequate training   Oh, it's definitely a training issue.  I didn't mean to say that we shouldn't be using tazers ever.  I just wanted to point out that tazers have their own pros and cons and aren't a prefect replacement for existing methods."
respectporn,2rromf,sirblastalot,3,Fri Jan 9 00:48:45 2015 UTC,"How do you know when to use which? What if you're facing a suspect who has his hands in his pockets and isn't complying? You don't know if he has a gun, knife or just his phone in there. If you choose your taser, what if he draws a gun? These types of situations are never white and black. I believe officers do carry both a taser and their pistol on occasion, and they are trained in these sorts of situations, but i think what the video is trying to show is that it's easy for us to just be sat here talking about what should be done, but we don't truly understand or appreciate the all the  situations that officers face."

respectporn,2rromf,mixand,0,Fri Jan 9 12:33:54 2015 UTC,"I thought that was kind of funny too.  It's not really a fair scenario.  All they give him is a gun.  Either he uses it and they go, ""See!?  You shot an unarmed man!"" or that big motherfucker grabs you, takes the gun away, ""kills you,"" and they go, ""See!? If you don't shoot, you'd be dead!""  Taser was the perfect answer for that scenario."

Give the trainee both, and in scenario 1 they are shot before they get any clue which to draw, in scenario 2 they've got the unarmed giant on top of them while still trying to decide which to draw. And the decision that they had a second or two to decide upon will then be pored over at the leisure of people who were not there and are not facing a potentially life-threatening situation as they pontificate."
respectporn,2rromf,TheDocJ,0,Fri Jan 9 18:48:17 2015 UTC,"Totally, but my point is that no matter what choice they make, there will be criticism - which may be the goal of the creators of the scenario."

This is, or should be, a public service announcement about the importance of hiring people with the mental clarity and intelligence required to actually perform the function a police officer is meant to have, and training them for likely scenarios they may/will face.

MSs occur when an individual loses awareness and subsequently gains awareness after a brief lapse in consciousness, or when there are sudden shifts between states of wakefulness and sleep. In behavioral terms, MSs manifest as droopy eyes, slow eyelid-closure, and head nodding.  In electrical terms, microsleeps are often classified as a shift in electroencephalography (EEG) during which 4–7 Hz (theta wave) activity replaces the waking 8–13 Hz (alpha wave) background rhythm.

respectporn,2qayii,Wardenclyffe56,-2,Mon Jan 5 06:32:47 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you. I think he made the situation more dangerous.   The bullets went very close by some of the bystanders and could easily have ricochet off the wall or an object and hit someone. Furthermore the act of shooting at robbers with guns will definitely increase the probability of thees robbers shooting and someone dying.   Most of the time and i would go as far as to say over 98% of the time they won't shoot, its just to intimidate, they are there for the money. In that situation, the best option was to give them the money. If he was alone or they started shooting, his shooting would have been justified imo.   In reality, most of the ""good"" citizens who buy handguns for protection don't need them as they don't live in a dangerous area where it might be somewhat justified. And are actually making it more dangerous for everyone around as well as themselves.  I saw a video where they tested gun enthusiast reactions in a simulated scenario that they were not aware of, and even after training and taking good care of the gun, non of them got any help out of carrying a gun and i think they all said that you would need way more training to be able to react when a situation appears and that might not even be enough.  I think and statistics are most likely going to back me up on the fact that gun owners who buy for protection are short sited and naive when it comes to how the gun will add years to their lives. Maybe I'm the only one thinking about whats the best way to add more years, and some don't care as long as they can have a better possibility of shooting back if a 1 in a million shot (the odds are surely higher) of a crazy person shooting at you with a gun."

respectporn,2omopi,superdiscodancefloor,16,Mon Dec 8 15:25:57 2014 UTC,"Honest, sincere questions should be replied with honest, sincere answers:  Well, there may not be a reason you should, but there may be a reason you would. In the video's case, maybe something about the lady reminded him of his mom, maybe something about working hard all day and needing a rest, maybe thinking that just a seat on the train would be nice.   What I mean is, something that might motivate the individual beyond necessity.  Another example: maybe a stranger did you a solid earlier that day (ie: you dropped something, and someone yelled/ran up to you to tell you that you did), so you decided to pay it forward by doing a small solid for someone else.  So you may not have a practical reason that you should give up your seat to someone whose able-bodied, but there may be a reason why you would."
respectporn,2omopi,A_Giraffe,4,Mon Dec 8 16:37:41 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the insight. This may soundly absolutely silly, but I used to work at a job that required me to ride on trains a lot. I would look at the people around me and think whether I should be giving up my seat to someone else because I don't mind standing up. But then the next question would be ""so who do I choose who I give this seat to?""  In situations where everyone else around me was able bodied and not under any difficulty, I fought with myself for awhile. The conversation in my head went like: ""Should I give this seat to that lady standing nearby? But why not give it to the guy beside her? Am I choosing based on gender? Do I stand up and leave and let them decide themselves?""  I used to think it was gentlemanly of me to give up seats for women, but now I think that it's a bit on the discriminatory side. What, men don't want to sit down as well? Women get more tired while working? That's all bullshit. Now I just be super aware of my surroundings and give up my seat only when I see someone else more deserving of it (people with heavy bags or babies, the physically challenged and the elderly)."
respectporn,2omopi,superdiscodancefloor,2,Mon Dec 8 16:51:44 2014 UTC,"That's basically it, you know? Just be aware and try to help whoever needs the most help. And even if everybody else around you is able-bodied, if it really wouldn't hurt you to stand, you might want to give up your seat anyway just to be kind to others. It may even make their day, and make them feel better about humanity in general. Small acts of kindness go a long, long way."

respectporn,2omopi,ApathyPyramid,51,Mon Dec 22 08:45:14 2014 UTC,"Yes, thankfully they do.  But it isn't recorded, uploaded, or nationally broadcast nearly as much as such negative instances would be. How much of CNN or FOX News' coverage of Ferguson showed the community helping clean up, or rebuild after the riots and fires?  People also are very rude and inconsiderate everyday, racist every day, bigoted everyday...  We see these types of videos via public transit all the time.   If he'd have done something negative akin to what I've listed above, no matter how seemingly miniscule, this video would have spread like wildfire. It'd be on Good Morning America and CNN and everyone would be talking about how much of an ass Keanu Reeves is, with all his money and entitlement etc. etc.    But I feel sometimes as a culture we don't give enough credit to these small acts of kindness, and thusly they go by the wayside.  I personally welcome this type of video, no matter how mundane it may seem, or who was the gentleman(or woman) giving up their sit for someone. Maybe it'll remind someone on the subway or the tube today to be extra conscientious about those around them and offer their seat.  Maybe you'll wait an extra 30 seconds today to hold the door for an elderly woman walking 1/2 a mph into the bank.  Maybe I'll give someone less fortunate than I all the change in my pocket today, even though I can't afford my own bills at the moment. Maybe those people will inturn do something additionally positive for this world...  TL;DR:  People still do do this every day.  And (I personally believe) it's nice to be reminded of that."

You're worried about getting in everyone's way and being a nuisance, and they're worried about how you're doing and making sure you're taken care of.  This seems like a good time to share a story.  I had recently bought my motorcycle; a 250cc Ninja. It's a starter bike, but I was proud of it. I was going to have a solo picnic on the side of a mountain while watching the sunset. I hadn't yet learned to not brake while turning, and when I took a corner, there was some traffic I hadn't expected. I hit the brakes and a patch of dust; the bike slipped, went sideways and I slid some fifteen feet down the street.  People got out of their cars immediately. Even though I assured them I was okay, they called an ambulance. The lady who made the call pointed out the long streak of blood I had left on the road. Sure enough, there was an elongated puddle of red- ending in the now empty bottle of cranberry juice I had been keeping in my backpack's side pocket.  A police car, an ambulance and a fire truck showed up, largely because they didn't really have anything else to do at the time, according to them. They looked me over and patched up my scraped hand, then made sure I got a ride home."
respectporn,2o69tq,GrinningManiac,4,Wed Dec 3 19:24:50 2014 UTC,The cranberry juice is hilarious! Were all the service people annoyed at the lack of emergency and were you embarrassed by the fuss?
respectporn,2o69tq,GrinningManiac,2,Wed Dec 3 23:01:45 2014 UTC,"Ah, they knew there wasn't an emergency in the first place. I explained that I felt fine while the lady was on the phone, and she relayed that- but as I mentioned, they didn't have anything else to do, so it seemed like everyone just took their emergency vehicles out for a spin to see the kid who wrecked his motorcycle. They offered me a ride in the ambulance, but warned me that I'd have to pay for it if I accepted.  I had too much adrenaline in my veins to be embarrassed. I was much more concerned about the condition of the bike and the fact that I had crashed less than two weeks after I started driving."

I'd crashed several times over the years before that, so rather than write it off with ""I'll be more careful,"" I decided that I wasn't a responsible enough driver for the bike.  I drive a car now.

They reinforce motorcycle tire walls to let them hold up somewhat, even when flat, but the mechanic had seen a man die in my exact situation.  It was incredible. My bike didn't even shake. I was looking at cars around me to see what had made the bang, and decided to pull over just in case. The tire was soft enough that I could push it in with my toe."

respectporn,2nuvps,buckeyenation70,9,Sun Nov 30 20:58:41 2014 UTC,It's great that Urban Meyer warned all players that if any fists were thrown that they would be kicked off the team. It all starts with the coach. Gardner seems like a great guy. This was great to see. I was watching the Louisville and Kentucky football game this past Saturday too and the head coaches of each time were exchanging argumentative words. You can't expect your players to respect the other team if you don't.
respectporn,2nuvps,creamedpie,1 point,Sun Nov 30 23:46:38 2014 UTC,"Not at all surprising especially considering last year two Ohio State players were ejected, one flicked off the stadium and family as he exited and another I believe was Roby who is a very good NFL rookie for the Broncos.  Of course as a Michigan fan I wanted to see them get a stupid penalty and have they're players ejected.  Although you never want to see someone break an ankle like this or get an injury when they're so young."

respectporn,2ntenz,InvisibleJawa,8,Sun Nov 30 04:48:33 2014 UTC,"There's a common saying among hockey fans.   I went to see a fight and a hockey game broke out.   It's not as violent of a sport as it used to be, but sometimes you just have the one scrappy guy on your team who fights for a good morale boost at the beginning of the game. Red Wings used to have Jordin Tootoo who did that shit all the time and it was awesome. He just wasn't good enough at the actual game to keep him on the team unfortunately lol."
respectporn,2ntenz,Dakrys,2,Sun Nov 30 07:30:36 2014 UTC,"Hockey is inherently an extremely dangerous game, and fighting is historically how the players have self-policed each other.   It's become much less common in recent years though, due to rule changes. In particular, the addition of the second referee has helped to eliminate a lot of the dirty play, which has made fighting much less necessary."

respectporn,2ntenz,chaserjames,3,Sun Nov 30 04:53:29 2014 UTC,"Fighting serves many purposes: 1. If a player hits the opposing player hard or in a dirty fashion, there's probably going to fight (Most common) 2. Possibly to resolve an issue from a previous game.  3. Serves as entertainment for fans 4. Anger release in an intense game 5. Players are trash talking and a fight starts from a scrum 6. Player hits the opposing goalie.   As a long time fan, sometimes the reason a fight starts is blurry, but a majority of us enjoy it nonetheless. And to people new to the game it's sometimes hard to understand why fighting is part of the game because it's seems malicious, but often it isn't. Hope that answers your question."
respectporn,2ntenz,LevelHeadedAssassin,1 point,Sun Nov 30 08:27:09 2014 UTC,"From my very limited understanding of the sport, it's to settle a score. And it has to be mutually agreed upon."
respectporn,2ntenz,Ponchorello7,2,Sun Nov 30 04:52:37 2014 UTC,"I don't really see this as the ""score settling"" type of fight.   More often than not, two dudes are just like, ""Hey, wanna fight?"" ""Sure."" and they go. It's agreed on nearly always but it's not often because either of them are particularly mad about something."
respectporn,2ntenz,Dakrys,1 point,Sun Nov 30 07:28:31 2014 UTC,"They didn't really in this fight. The goals of a fight are to land more solid punches and knock the other guy down. This was a pretty even fight with no strong resolution. Often fights are to break frustration and change players' and fans' emotional or mental states.  For example if you have 3 goals scored against you in quick succession, it can feel like hope is lost. On the next play if you get in there and have a strong win in a fight it is an easier way to get out of a defeated mindset and riled up/adrenaline pumping again.  Alternatively if you are playing a team that is pretty physical, or against players that are trying to piss you off (which some actively do as their primary MO, Sean Avery) it's kind of like /r/justiceporn to get a few big hits in on them."
respectporn,2ntenz,jodax00,-2,Sun Nov 30 21:55:27 2014 UTC,An avid hockey fan friend of mine told me some players have fighting in their contract. They have a quota to fill. I don't know how true that is though.
respectporn,2ntenz,KilliamWallace,5,Sun Nov 30 15:59:52 2014 UTC,"No such thing. They are just expected to fight when the time comes.  Dirty hit? Let them know thats not ok.  Team is looking sluggish? Fight their fighter and try and put some energy into the bench. If that doesn't really happen too often, then there isn't really much of a point to employ enforcers"

But even I realize the inherent danger in fighting. The same problems that the NFL have made famous are all prevalent in the NHL, as academic studies have shown. Numerous closed head injuries throughout a career of fighting can lead to permanent brain damage. Try researching Bob Probert and Derek Boogaard. They're pretty much the poster boys for how being an NHL enforcer can literally ruin your health/life. Personally, I think that there are ways to make fighting in the NHL less dangerous, and some of the new rules to do with fighting are aimed at just that. But there isn't any way to make punching someone repeatedly in the face not dangerous, really."

respectporn,2ntenz,tagjim,0,Mon Dec 1 03:39:21 2014 UTC,"Others in this thread seem to think I'm an uninformed jerk, so I just want to tell you where I'm coming from. I'm a huge baseball fan. I used to see so called ""brushback"" pitches, or pitchers intentionally hitting batters, as a necessary part of the game. Retaliation for showboating, or showing up a pitcher, or running up the score, or whatever. The pitcher, and by extension, the team, were sending a clear message: Don't disrespect us, or there will be consequences.   I've been lucky enough to get season tickets to the minor league team in my area, and have been to a large number of games in the past 3-4 years. Really good seats, up close. Minor league pitchers throw anywhere from 80-90mph. In the past 4 years I've seen no less than 10 guys get plunked. Intentionally or unintentionally, I was never sure. But sitting 25-30 feet away from a guy who just got hit by a pitch going 90 on the elbow, or the wrist, or God forbid near his head, has changed my view on pitchers brushing hitters back. There's a scary flat ""thud"" sound that a baseball makes when it hits someone that fast. Mostly the batters will grimace a bit, shake it off and take their base, but I've seen a few young guys have to leave the game, one on a stretcher.   I guess I just feel like ""sending a message"" isn't worth the possible permanent injury it could cause. And hockey fights, to me, really are just about sending a ""don't disrespect us"" type message. No doubt it sells tickets, too, so that's mainly why the NHL puts up with it.   Oh, and I like to play the drums for fun. And I'm a really bad guitar player."

respectporn,2ntenz,Killingstick,11,Sun Nov 30 14:05:20 2014 UTC,"Well, this looks staged as fuck.   Lol, no.    The fact that no ref even tried to intervene,   Refs usually don't break up clean fights in hockey, as it's part of the game. They get in there when a player goes down, or after they're tired. They're not going to risk a punch to the face to break up a fight.    and that the commentator just started analyzing the fight as soon as they began is just retarded   Again, fighting is part of hockey.
