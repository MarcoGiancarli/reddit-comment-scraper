The general form of the problem is this: There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options: (1) Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track. (2) Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person. Which is the correct choice?

If you have the choice, you'll choose whichever one makes you feel better in the end.  Not making a choice seemingly saves you from responsibility for any of the deaths, though not all people would do that;  Doing ANYTHING might make you feel better as well.  In reality, how would you even know for sure that the lever does anything, and why are these people tied up in the first place?  My thoughts: mafia hit on the one guy and his family.  They're torturing him by forcing him to watch where the trolley will go. One way kills him and the other kills his family.  He'd likely want his family to live over his own life, so I'd change the tracks.  Sounds crazy, but wouldn't you make up a story to justify your choices?"

Iowa-class battleships are still the coolest, though.  Edit: Apparently it's straight-up the biggest gun ever fitted on a warship. At least that's what Wikipedia tells me. Also the gun was officially listed as a 40cm gun to downplay its actual caliber, 45cm, apparently."

I know Goering blamed Hitler for some of the Me-262's faults, but it's interesting to see what he came up with.   ended up losing pretty badly   You could say that, yeah.

animegifsound,2z4ibq,Kamorus,-3,Tue Mar 17 00:27:14 2015 UTC,Nope. Yoko made it worth it. Plus I did really enjoy the show. I just didn't like Simon. I am actually gonna get the Team Gurren logo as a Tattoo.
