paradoxplaza,3e1tdj,Smurph269,10,Tue Jul 21 15:03:47 2015 UTC,"They are both generally ""most troops wins"" but EU4 is a lot easier to screw up as a commander. You control your army makeup more directly, so you have to get a reasonable split of infantry, calvalry and artillery. In CK2 your army makeup is controlled by your buildings and there isn't much you can do about it. Commanders in EU4 are also kind of a precious resource and you at most will have a couple in your empire, so you have to make sure the armies that are more likely to see actual combat have commanders. In CK2 it automatically gives every army several commanders. CK2 you have a regenerating pool of levies that you call your army up from when you need it. In EU4 you have to build the troops just like Vicky. In EU4 tech level also matters a lot more. Basically in CK2 you have to be doing something really stupid like a naval invasion or attack across a major river to lose to a numerically inferior force. In EUIV you could just lose because you forgot to assign/recruit a commander or you have too many cannons, or the enemy is 2 tech levels above you.    Basically I want a medieval style army, but I want to be more involved in building and commanding it like in EU4."
paradoxplaza,3e1tdj,FeederChan,3,Tue Jul 21 15:31:58 2015 UTC,Well not true Prussian troops can take 4 times their troops ;p. One time I wasn't paying attention and France attacked my Prussian troops somewhere with no leader and France had 6-6 general and my side won 2 to 1.
paradoxplaza,3e1tdj,sojuicy,3,Tue Jul 21 17:11:45 2015 UTC,"That is definitely not right, or at least just semi-right. Yes, if you just raise your levies there is not much you can do, except using a commander that fits your needs, but even that can make a huge difference, since character traits and leadership traits can have a huge impact.   Furthermore there is an entire retinue system and - with the new Horse Lords expansion - Horde system (which are basically nomadic retinues), which allows you to build standing army compositions, which can completely obliterate armies thrice your size, if you play your cards right. Depending on the traits your commanders have, your culture and/or which kind or which combination of infantry/cavalry/archers/whatever, armies can use tactics that are far superior or inferior to other tactics and therefore be decisive in battle.  http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Combat_tactics  Some mods even let you single combat within fights and the result gives you an even bigger morale bonus or malus.  Most people just appoint commanders with the biggest martial score to their armies (if even that) and yes, in that case there's not much variety. But if you get your mind around the whole combat tactic system, you have a whole new ck2 world to explore.   I would even go that far and say the combat systems are one of the most complex features of ck2.   edit: I can't say much about eu4, since my laptop is too crappy to play it."

paradoxplaza,3e1tdj,Banana57113,2,Tue Jul 21 18:27:54 2015 UTC,"In CK2, the amount of troops you have is the your levy, which you can raise at any time all at once. When you hire mercenaries, you hire several thousand all at once. The only way you can have a standing army is to build retinues, don't become necessary until very late game.   In EU4, you have a limit as to how many troops you can have, but you can surpass this as much as you'd like if your willing to take the penalty. Mercenaries are just like normal troops but they don't consume manpower. They are, however, more expensive. Troops don't appear immediately, they take time to build unlike in CK2.  The possible outcomes of the war are decide with your CB, so even if you occupy the entire country you can only take land you have a claim to. On the other hand, in EU4 CB's simply reduce the amount of aggressive expansion you get. You can, in theory, demand anything even if you don't have a claim on it.  Both games have attrition mechanics where you gradually lose troops depending on the size of the army and the terrain, but I've noticed that it's much more severe in EU4."

More astute viewers may notice that I accidentally gave Calais to Flanders and not myself, which sucked. Coming up next time: a pretty damn early coalition war (I really went overboard with fabricating).    Also if anyone can use photoshop I'd really appreciate a hearts of iron style waving version of this flag for use in the background. Thanks and I hope you enjoyed!"

paradoxplaza,3dyzxu,thejdizzler,7,Mon Jul 20 18:00:26 2015 UTC,"There's also option 3: Your stockpile doesn't buy adequate amounts of timber. The automatic stockpile does not attempt to buy all the materials necessary for construction at once, probably in order to prevent massive price fluctuations whenever anyone with a lot of spare cash wants to build something.  Try setting timber stockpile to manual, and order a large amount stored. Provided you have plenty of cash to pay for it, the stockpile will now buy all timber available to you, and afaik it will have higher priority than your own factories (I may be wrong about that)  It's in general a good idea to do this with all building materials if you have the money. It's especially useful if you notice that there is excess of something, sometimes you can buy certain materials (particularly concrete) for a much lower price than usual. Added bonus is that you constructions will begin immediately if you have all ressources in store."
paradoxplaza,3dyzxu,Fauler_Lentz,2,Mon Jul 20 18:55:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this should help, as it doesn't force me to close my lumber factory. I'm running a pretty huge surplus, so the 30,000 units of timber I need should be affordable"
paradoxplaza,3dyzxu,skrots,4,Mon Jul 20 19:08:59 2015 UTC,"I'm actually also playing Australia right now, and getting enough timber has been a bitch for me as well, since Aussie just doesn't produce enough domestically, and all the other GPs are probably eating their own as well.  I would close the lumber factories if I were you, those are rarely profitable (for me) and as you mentioned eat up too much timber. Furniture's good for keeping your pops happy, so you might want to keep those around.  All I can really recommend doing is sphering more timber-producing countries, or taking some woodlands for yourself.   What's really killing me though is the lack of coal, have you noticed this at all? Even with Persia and Korea sphered, my poor factories are absolutely starved for coal."
paradoxplaza,3dyzxu,skrots,4,Mon Jul 20 18:10:25 2015 UTC,"Yea, the coal shortage is pretty bad, my steel and cement factories are hardly running at all. I'm not sure how to rectify this also: I've sphered Korea, Peru and Colombia, all of which produce Coal. After I remove the Philippines from the hands of the Spanish, I think I need to get my hands on some Chinese Coal in Guanaxi"
paradoxplaza,3dyzxu,ClockworkChristmas,6,Mon Jul 20 18:27:10 2015 UTC,"Don't let those tasty Chinese provinces tempt you, taking anything in China (other than treaty ports and Taiwan) is absolutely haram.   If you're feeling ballsy, I noticed a massive coal mine in British India. I'm thinking about gunning for that in the next Great War, if possible."
paradoxplaza,3dyzxu,skrots,2,Mon Jul 20 18:31:11 2015 UTC,"I'm allied to GB, so that may be a no no. China, on second thoughts may be a no no too, I barely defeated them when I was taking on Dai Nam, and that was with help from GB. Do you know if any where else in southeast Asia produces any Coal?"
paradoxplaza,3dyzxu,Wholesome230,2,Mon Jul 20 18:36:21 2015 UTC,Korea is your best bet. Also Prussian lands.
paradoxplaza,3dyd7e,ProfessionalWingman,6,Mon Jul 20 15:20:14 2015 UTC,Played the game for years and I've never done either. The only reason to embargo is if you have Centers Of Trade and they have a lot of merchants coming into and you also don't mind pissing them off.
paradoxplaza,3dyd7e,lalilulelo09,2,Mon Jul 20 17:38:06 2015 UTC,Wouldn't making trade agreements and embargoes decrease your CoT's value then ?
paradoxplaza,3dyd7e,Braeburner,3,Mon Jul 20 17:49:56 2015 UTC,"Total value of the trade may go die, but if you have the same number of merchants, then you have a higher control percentage, which makes you a little more likely to get a monopoly.💶💶💶"
paradoxplaza,3dyd7e,lalilulelo09,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:29:54 2015 UTC,It's been awhile since I've played but I don't think it does if it there enough merchants in the area to fill it up. It helps if you have low chance merchants. I think the biggest debuff you get is to your tech progress. Like I said I've never done either and I suggest going mercantile instead of protectionist/isolationist (forgot what it is called).
paradoxplaza,3dxntq,MisForMuffins,3,Mon Jul 20 11:35:09 2015 UTC,"I'm using the Divergences of Darkness mod and playing as England -> British Commonwealth, and I just noticed this problem as my pops were remaining mostly conservative. This hasn't happened in any games before, and the reasonably high consciousness on the bar is because I recently formed the Commonwealth. I have about 3% clergy in each state, but the reduction due to them is unusually high, like -.3 consciousness. What's wrong?"
paradoxplaza,3dxntq,DirgeHumani,2,Mon Jul 20 11:37:39 2015 UTC,"It looks like about 3/4 of your population is farmers/laborers, who I think have a modifier that helps them stay conservative. Since about 3/4 of your population is conservative, it is probably most of those unskilled workers causing it. If you industrialize hard you'll probably see an ideological switch."
paradoxplaza,3dxntq,skrots,2,Mon Jul 20 17:28:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay. I'll try to industrialize harder in the oncoming years."

paradoxplaza,3dxntq,sarmedalwan,2,Tue Jul 21 08:03:17 2015 UTC,How do you transform into the English Commonwealth?  In my past(and first) Dual Monarchy game I went for Anglois dualism and I just stayed as the Dual Monarchy until I took the Anglois schooling decision and made everyone Anglois.
paradoxplaza,3dxntq,King-Rhino-Viking,2,Tue Jul 21 00:03:58 2015 UTC,"I went with the French path and played in a way to make the English population militant and conscious, and eventually the Glorious Revolution event fired and I tag switched to England and went from there. IIRC, there were events where you could support Scottish and Irish independence and help them gain independence from Scandinavia/Dual Monarchy, and I sphered both of them and cored."
paradoxplaza,3dtuov,Hawkeye117,61,Sun Jul 19 12:13:27 2015 UTC,I don't really know how Hearts of Irons works but I'm guessing those 260k russians are rather quickly running out of supplies. How hard will it be for you to win a battle against them with no supplies? Will they eventually starve? Do you take prisoners in HoI or do you just shoot all enemy soldiers?
paradoxplaza,3dtuov,tkrens,90,Sun Jul 19 12:51:28 2015 UTC,"They'll run out of supplies. Depending on how much they've got already, that might take up to a month. After that their organization (essentially morale) will quickly drop. Though here there's so many units that they're suffering immense stacking penalties, so there's no real need to wait as they can't effectively fight back anyway.  They can then easily be defeated in combat since units try to retreat the moment they hit 0 organization, and will then be removed from the map. There's no prisoner mechanic."
paradoxplaza,3dtuov,Meneth,17,Sun Jul 19 12:54:55 2015 UTC,"Yup, also being attacked from 2 directions at once gives them a massive combat penalty; much less 3,4,5 etc."
paradoxplaza,3dtuov,tkrens,33,Sun Jul 19 14:14:32 2015 UTC,"I see! It would be interesting if there was a prisoner mechanic. What would you even do with that many prisoners? Although, considering the OP is playing Nazi Germany ...   It is a bit silly that hundreds of thousands of people just 'disappear' from the map though."
paradoxplaza,3dtuov,Meneth,69,Sun Jul 19 13:02:59 2015 UTC,"They cease to be a fighting force, so they're no longer relevant.  A PoW mechanic might be interesting, but I doubt the effort to pay-off ratio is nearly good enough to justify them spending development time on that."
paradoxplaza,3dtuov,tkrens,27,Sun Jul 19 13:04:59 2015 UTC,True. I imagine it might take a lot of effort to program something like that and it really wouldn't offer much of a mechanic. Paradox also very understandably wants to stay out of certain bits of WW2 that aren't directly relevant to military strategy.
paradoxplaza,3dtuov,Timmetie,55,Sun Jul 19 13:11:06 2015 UTC,Eh and PoW treatment in WW2 is a pretty iffy topic.   You don't want to make a deathcamp simulator at any point.

paradoxplaza,3dtuov,Beansareno1,-9,Sun Jul 19 21:56:04 2015 UTC,Its also part of the reason why EU4 is bad and is pretty substandard for Paradox games.
paradoxplaza,3dtuov,Timmetie,19,Sun Jul 19 23:59:28 2015 UTC,"Deathcamp simulator   On that, though, what if there was something like a pool of prisoners, and for XXXX amount of prisnoners, you gained XXXX IC, to simulate exactly what the Nazi's did, which was slave labor. Or maybe for every (for example) 10,000 prisoners, you gained 200 men in manpower, to simulate drafting from defeated enemies (Like the Germans did with the Dutch, French, etc.) It wouldn't be much but in the shitfuck grind that is Germany VS Soviet Union every last soldier counts."
paradoxplaza,3dtuov,lee1026,17,Sun Jul 19 19:54:48 2015 UTC,"You get manpower and IC from occupied provinces, that pretty much does what you're referring too.   And again, slave labour is an iffy subject because not every country put their PoWs to forced labour. Nor do I think the forced labour was in anyway effective enough to warrant putting into the game."
paradoxplaza,3dtuov,Hell_Libertine,15,Sun Jul 19 15:06:48 2015 UTC,"Even the United States had the PoWs work. Not forced labor, and they generally survived, but it still freed up Americans to work on other things."

paradoxplaza,3ds992,lukemacu,40,Sun Jul 19 09:55:22 2015 UTC,"The thing is, his ""princess can only marry a prince"" law seemed a bit of a hopeless act. As a Muslim, his succession laws would be Agnatic Open, meaning marrying the princess off would not change his succession. In fact, Jafar's reasoning for marrying Jasmine was a bit stupid as it would not put him or his children in line to the throne.   Jafar would have been better off just hypnotising the sultan to give him a large patch of land, and then kill the sultan off (the sultan had no sons, and he never gave any indication that he had any other family). The assassination plot would have been fairly simple as the sultan clearly had the ""trusting"" trait. Although admittedly it would be hard for Jafar to find co-conspirators as Jasmine, the sultan, Aladdin, Jafar, Lago, and that tiger seemed to be the only members of the court."
paradoxplaza,3ds992,gamas,16,Sun Jul 19 11:10:51 2015 UTC,well what about hypnotising the tiger to kill Sultan ? nobody would suspect.

paradoxplaza,3ds992,MubarakMMutairi,27,Sun Jul 19 11:34:48 2015 UTC,"The characters in Aladdin use the word ""Allah"" when referring to God (the sultan shouts ""Praise Allah!"" when he realises Jasmine wants to marry Aladdin at the end for example), so it is pretty much assumed that Agrabah is Islamic (especially since the story is based on the story with the same name in ""One Thousand One Nights"", which is generally accepted to have mostly been written in the Middle East at the height of the Abbasids (although the original story was set in the Far East)).  (Of course it's all silly as CK2 simplifies the Muslim succession laws massively for gameplay reasons - from what I've understood from a brief reading, actual Islamic succession was pretty much that the successor was whoever the sultan felt like, so the sultan going ""fuck it, I'm naming my son-in-law the heir"" is perfectly legitimate)"
paradoxplaza,3ds992,gamas,7,Sun Jul 19 11:36:18 2015 UTC,Isn't Allah the Arabic word for God? So it doesn't mean he's Muslim.
paradoxplaza,3ds992,greyoda,21,Sun Jul 19 12:20:19 2015 UTC,"Right, but in the original story, most of the characters are Muslim with the exception of a Jewish merchant...  Also, the architecture and language depicted in Disney's Aladdin coincide with Persian culture, and whilst we could speculate that Disney had enough eye for detail to consider the many possible monotheistic religions of Iran, chances are that in a movie based on a story written by an Arabic person during the time of the Islamic Caliphate, is highly likely to depict rulers as being some form of Muslim...  It's about as safe to assume that the people of Agrabbah are Muslim as it is that the characters of ""Sleeping Beauty"" are Christian."
paradoxplaza,3ds992,gamas,4,Sun Jul 19 12:30:32 2015 UTC,"Except for the fact that none (well almost) of the One Thousand and One Nights stories have anything to do with the Abbasids or Arabs in general.  Most of these narratives and fables predate the Abbasids (and Islam!) and originate from across Greater Asia. European Orientalists attributed them to the Abbasids (and Arabs) because of well Orientalism...also because it was transmitted to Europeans through the Arab world.  The notion that Arab bedouins knew or recited these stories is ridiculous! We have our own fables, epics and poetry. In fact I never even heard of Aladdin until the Disney film, can you believe that! Stories about Juha are more well known and more beloved in the Arab world as well as the generic old wives tales and fables that are unique to each specific region.  The only stories that I might concede that are actually Arab in origin are ones that are politically charged and satire members of the elite, like the one about men being shoved in cupboards with a peasant on top and a sultan on the bottom.  Also yes CK2 Muslim succession law is trash."
paradoxplaza,3ds992,MubarakMMutairi,8,Sun Jul 19 13:08:09 2015 UTC,"Then what religion would you say the people of Agrabah are? Aladdin is an Arabic name, the architecture is definitely post-Muhammad at the least, it's clearly set during the CK2 timeframe, and it's clearly set in the Middle East... And would Disney have gone to the effort of having the Sultan say ""Allah"" in place of God if the intention hadn't been to portray them as Muslim. I mean, yes the word Allah is simply the Arabic word for God, but it's not like the characters are speaking Arabic the rest of the time... It's not like Disney thought ""we better make sure that we retain cultural accuracy by making sure the sultan says ""Praise Allah"" instead of ""Praise God"""", whilst otherwise having the characters speak English, having a princess with the free will to choose who she marries, a sentient monkey, and a genie who engages in anachronisms for comedic value...  Let's not beat around the bush, no matter how culturally accurate or inaccurate it was, Disney were gunning for Muslim."
paradoxplaza,3ds992,gamas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:43:11 2015 UTC,"Then what religion would you say the people of Agrabah are?   Wholesome American Secularism.   Aladdin is an Arabic name, the architecture is definitely post-Muhammad at the least, it's clearly set during the CK2 timeframe, and it's clearly set in the Middle East...   Aladdin is indeed Arabic but it just means the Highest of Faith and I wouldn't be surprised if there are Old Aramaic or Hebrew versions of the name. The architecture is ambiguous and is inspired by Mughal/Safavid architecture which is itself a revival of pre-Islamic (Zoroastrian) Iranian architecture. The Mongols (Timurid in this case if I recall correctly) used architecture as a form of legitimacy. It most cleary is not set in the CK2 timeframe since the Sphinx was still being built. Remember that scene in the ""Whole New World"" segment where they pass some mason working on the Sphinx and he's so surprised that he broke the Sphinx's nose? The Middle East is a modern term and frankly Americans confuse and lump up a lot of different cultures together because they make the same stupid assumptions over and over again which is brown+muslim (or vaguely non-Western Christian or Jew) = Arab.   I mean, yes the word Allah is simply the Arabic word for God, but it's not like the characters are speaking Arabic the rest of the time...   Of course they wouldn't be speaking Arabic for the rest of the film. It would have but the hit it was if it did.  I love that we a ""heated"" discussion about a Disney film that was poorly researched on a CK2 forum."

Which goes back to the idea that they wouldn't have used the word ""Allah"" if not to be part of Disney's attempt since the 90s to demonstrate diversity beyond European Christian centrism.  As demonstrated by all the anachronisms (the sphinx was being built, but also there were fireworks in China (which weren't invented until the 7th century)), and the fact women aren't dressed modestly (by Iranian standards), it is clear they weren't going into the facets of the culture.... So clearly it was just a bone thrown to acknowledge the religion.   I love that we a ""heated"" discussion about a Disney film that was poorly researched on a CK2 forum.   Well of course, it wouldn't be a CK2 discussion if we weren't discussing the plausibility of fictional events!"
paradoxplaza,3ds992,gamas,8,Sun Jul 19 15:13:47 2015 UTC,"and the fact women aren't dressed modestly (by Iranian standards)   Or anyone's standards considering the period.  Jasmine's outfit and her pet tiger is further proof that the culture depicted in Aladdin isn't Arab but just a caricature of the 'Oriental Other'. You have pre-Islamic (and to an extent Islamic) Iranian Architecture, Americanized Arab names (except for the villain whose name is not Americanized) Mughal costumes and animals, Ottoman/Solomonian Jinn and a veneer of what passes off as Islam to Europe all centered around a story originally set in China.  Also the Jewish merchant is a talking parrot for some reason. Also a monkey."
