runescape,3e0wbw,Slayer0590,2,Tue Jul 21 03:43:13 2015 UTC,Glad to see that there are still people out there who care about people and helping them out more than pixels. We've all been there and giving someone a chance like this was probably huge to him.  I've done something like that a few times. People using royal d'hide or ganodermic with T80 weapons who get a hilt drop at araxxor and can't afford to buy the leg. I enjoy rewarding their hard work and determination by fronting them the cash to buy the leg. It's always a huge deal to them to all of a sudden have more than 5m and I haven't been scammed yet.

I'm level 134 and I had to sell everything I owned for a set of drygore longs and some bandos. And I'm damn proud I could do that. Everyone has their own goals and paces.

I could probably afford some drygores if I really wanted them, but I can't ever seem to land a hit with melee.  I don't know how people can AFK through everything and end up at the top, honestly. I have nothing long term to pay attention to, which may as well be why some of my stats are so low -- I hate grinds and they are so boring. I don't know any good moneymaking honestly (500 frost dragons took me like 3 hours) so I don't see myself coming to any goals soon."

runescape,3e0wbw,Max_Someday,0,Tue Jul 21 12:40:34 2015 UTC,What did the others say about him when he showed up for bm?
runescape,3e0wbw,subs07,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:10:27 2015 UTC,"The conversation went like this:  Team: Who is Tiki? Who invited him?  Me: He's part of our team.  Team: He seems a little low level don't you think?  Me: I said he's part of our team.  After that, nobody really argued.  They were actually rather helpful and told him what to do. Mostly saying in public chat what to fight, who to stand beside, what to pray and to keep his hp at 100% at all times."

Yes, he's not experienced, but he did his very best and contributed to the kill.  He had a nox staff and survived for the kill, so he definitely contributed to damage. I wouldn't expect him to do any role beyond  DPS at this point, but most people wouldn't consider that either."

I think high level players tend to forget they were not morphed into the maxed, rich, know pretty much everything there is to know about the game overnight.    Who knows maybe one day Tiki will become one of those players who people talk about for his skills PVM'ing or maybe he will just evolve into being able to what he obviously wants to become.   If only a fraction of the high lvl players would consider doing what you did, even once, Runescape would be a much better place.   Good job!!! :)"

That's ridiculous. Either do this or reduce the cost for the large lamp.   Update inventory icons for Driftwood, cooked eeligator, trinket, mysterious axe, glowing orb, etc (as they're all reused from other parts of the game).   There is absolutely no need for this.

When your ring of wealth ""activates"" it simply prompts the gamecode to let you roll on the ""rare loot table"" rather than the regular one. it's a general misconception of the RoW, which has been clarified, but it never hurts to reiterate it for people without state of clarity about this particular item.

If your only care was for the WWF though you'd just write them a check and get a nice tax write off.  On the flipside an increase in demand for bonds makes them a lot more money."
runescape,3dyg11,AnselaJonla,-3,Mon Jul 20 18:11:20 2015 UTC,"I get it, but they're double dipping the benefits of the charitable event.   It's clear they care more about their bottom line than the charity, but still want to project the image that they don't."
runescape,3dyg11,Arighea,8,Mon Jul 20 18:19:07 2015 UTC,I think that's a fair assessment.  It's a good thing that they allow players to donate money with in game gold but it does seem like profit motive is the driving force here.
runescape,3dyg11,Arighea,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:48:20 2015 UTC,"If you expect your customers to donate the money, at least donate the resources involved. I find the way it's handled in bad taste.  The donating in game cash is a good touch, but it's not like the bonds themselves can enter the game in any other way but paying real money for them."

I don't know much about British tax law or IFRS but could they write all their donations off despite the fact that they directly profited from the donations?  They had a MUCH lower tax bill in 2014 than they did in 2013.  Keep in mind this isn't an accusation but if there are any British finance guys in here some answers would be appreciated.

They may be able to not only make money from selling the bonds themselves and save money with tax writeoffs, but they don't have to even reward players for contributing. Players donating bonds is an actual way to support a charity without paying any money themselves, which I think is great. And the whole 25% thing is essentially a referral. WWF I'm sure would rather have 75% of a ton of donations instead of 100% of none.   Sorry if that's not relevant to the discussion, I'm just feeling a witch hunt vibe in this thread."
runescape,3dyg11,Jamberry-11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:26:21 2015 UTC,The tax credits are a percentage of what Jagex donates to charity. What Jagex has already received through selling bonds is considered operating income.
runescape,3dyg11,AnselaJonla,3,Tue Jul 21 10:59:54 2015 UTC,"Not trying to pile on, but there are a lot more charitable events that donate a % of the proceeds than there are events that donate all. Charity concerts usually charge money for the ticket sales, of which, while the band is playing for free, a portion goes to the venue, some goes to pay the people working at the event, supplies, etc. A lot of times, the only money the charity will see is 20% (which is sometimes just added to the cost of the ticket) and then whatever they're getting from merch sales, usually 25-50%. Donating .75 on the dollar is not a bad number for the WWF to get, probably way more than a lot of their other fundraising opportunities. Again, not trying to attack you, just trying to educate as someone who's done a lot of work in the non-profit sector."
runescape,3dyg11,umopapsidn,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:53:18 2015 UTC,So who's the venue and where does this strawman argument fit into the discussion?
runescape,3dyg11,umopapsidn,4,Mon Jul 20 21:09:22 2015 UTC,"The venues in this case would be RuneScape servers, which aren't free and need to be maintained regularly. The company had to take time to plan the content, create graphical assets, write dialogue and the quizzes and translate them into several languages, implement it, run it through QA, and then release it. And this is all when they could have been developing something else for the game. So I think sending a little money the employees' way isn't out of turn."
runescape,3dyg11,Konekotoujou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:17:35 2015 UTC,"But half of the event is just a recycled dropper that the mods have shown a few time is easy to write questions for and set them in. Not saying what you said is wrong in most situations, but all they really developed that would have been too taxing to beg the question of what your saying is the pets. Titles are somewhat simple to make I would assume, the quiz itself is a recycled asset from events passed, and xp lamps are very much already a part of the game."
runescape,3dyg11,umopapsidn,0,Mon Jul 20 23:13:53 2015 UTC,"Its hardly a strawman argument.  Jagex cant profit by writing off tax, and like he says their cut of the charity bonds is very reasonable.   I find it amazing that people are suddenly surprised by tax writeoffs. Families and corporations have been doing it for years.  The only real downside is that by performing charity tax writeoffs you are taking money from the public purse and choosing where it goes."

You have a right to bring this up; I was also annoyed when I saw it was ""free"", but it clearly isn't. The argument some people are making of ""it costs bonds, not money, so it's free"" is ludicrous. Free means there are no requirements to unlock it. Bonds are currency. RuneScape gold is currency. Ergo, it is NOT free, because you are still spending one or the other to obtain it.  Sure, it goes to a charity, it's a donation, etc. but Jagex should not advertise it as free, because it's anything but free.  Suggestion: Change the cost to say ""1 bond"" and ""5 bonds"" for the respective pets. Some will argue it defeats the purpose of having a charity, because it gives the idea that you are buying pets more than you are supporting a charity. If this is the case, why did they do it differently with the Oxfam charity donation last Christmas? You had to donate 5 bonds to get all the cosmetics/rewards and the NPC taking the bonds was clear-cut about the rewards being unlocked with bonds only. Why is this any different?  And yes, I'm aware that hovering over the ""LOCKED"" button will explain that you have to donate the bonds, but the reward shop is still deceiving to first-timers who are opening it to see that it says ""Free!"" when it's clearly not free. A lot of players, including myself, didn't immediately notice there was hover-over text available on the buttons in the first place."

runescape,3dyg11,spencer707201,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:54 2015 UTC,no in game item has a redeemable real currency value.    are you sure about that?

runescape,3dyg11,Mage_Girl_91_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:58:18 2015 UTC,Ikr? At the very least put the price as 1 and 5 bonds. This was so misleading when I first saw it.
runescape,3dyg11,Natureguy909,0,Tue Jul 21 04:13:01 2015 UTC,"I guess I should sum up my thoughts on this.  It is a good thing that Jagex is doing.  The WWF is going to receive tons of money from Runescape players that they otherwise wouldn't have.  Why I think this is just about revenue: When you have bonds incorporated into so many facets of the game; bank slots, fashionscape, preset slots, keys, membership, etc.  If you increase demand in bonds for something like WWF or summer special membership the prices for bonds rises across the board, yet demand stays the same.  When I needed 1 more shark piece before the event was over, or when my membership has 8 hours left, I'm buying that bond at 9m or 12m.  When bonds are at 12m the large bond buyers are going to buy lots, which equates to more money in Jagex's pocket.  This isn't really rocket science and the people that force MTX on this game all went to what's widely considered one of the best, if not the best, business school in the world."

runescape,3dyg11,Jackins_Shipgutter,-8,Tue Jul 21 13:39:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah I understand, so it's not really free.  I think they should just be up front about it.  For the lamp you have to do a short activity.  For the pets you have to pay a certain amount of bonds, which directly represent a specific amount of in game or real life currency."
