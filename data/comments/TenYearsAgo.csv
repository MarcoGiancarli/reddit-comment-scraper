TenYearsAgo,3ae1vz,cojonathan,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:12:44 2015 UTC,"I briefly read the Wikipedia article and I'll do my best to summarize, but I might miss some details.  Basically the Michelin tires being used were failing on a specific turn of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and no one could figure out why. Michelin reps could only guarantee their tires would function properly for 10 laps.  As 13 of the 20 cars entered into the race used these tires they attempted to negotiate a solution. Suggestions such as creating new paths to slow the cars were shot down and any changes to the track would result in the race not being official. These drivers were told that they needed to figure it out on their own, but really anything they could have done would have put them at a severe disadvantage to the drivers not using Michelin.  The controversy seems to have come from the Michelin drivers plan once the race started. They all lined up and began normally but once they got to the pit entrance all 13 cars entered the pit and remained there. Fans, who were not aware of the tire issues or the lack of options, were outraged."
