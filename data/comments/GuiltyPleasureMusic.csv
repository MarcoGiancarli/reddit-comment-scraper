GuiltyPleasureMusic,3d9mq5,lilmonkey99,2,Tue Jul 14 16:10:12 2015 UTC,"I'm confused.  How is this ""proof"" that Bradley deserved what he got?  This song wasn't sang in the first person... he was telling a story.  Here's the wiki and his explanation on it:     I've never raped anyone at least as far as I can remember. We were at a party a long time ago and we were all talking about how much date rape sucked. This guy was like, ""Date rape isn't so bad; if it wasn't for date rape I'd never get laid."" Everyone at the party was bummed out about it, but I was cracking up and I wrote a funny song about it.   I guess it kind of sucks that he thought it was so funny, if that's what you meant, disregard this comment."
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3d9mq5,lilmonkey99,-1,Tue Jul 14 18:55:25 2015 UTC,I think it's crazy how nonchalant he is about things like child prostitution and daterape. That's what I meant.
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3d9mq5,lilmonkey99,2,Tue Jul 14 19:20:34 2015 UTC,"I guess.  I always kind of thought the song Date Rape was more of a ""hey dudes, it's a stupid, shitty thing to do that could put you in jail and get you raped back... so don't do it"", of course in Sublime's own way that doesn't sound like an after school special."
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3d9mq5,lilmonkey99,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:36:46 2015 UTC,"Nonetheless, Bradley did deserve it because he started heroin ""for show"". Because all his fans were doing it and he wanted to prove that he was cool."
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3d9mq5,lilmonkey99,3,Tue Jul 14 19:48:23 2015 UTC,So now he deserved to die because of the way he started using the drug that killed him?  (source on that btw?)

Feels like the shit was wished on me, everything I do for the nigga, and the nigga know I would do anything for him, but the nigga refuse to just quit straight shittin' on me Keepin' your distance? Probably best if you don't wanna fuck with me But you know me probably best, fuck pity You want that? You know it's Laila Ali's chest Tough titty, the problem's is you got a problem, you think that I'm already set So I'mma look down on you? Just be proud of me, you already got my respect I ain't tryin' to say something I'd regret so I'mma just stop, chasin' the pain Let you deal with the fact that we don't get along cause I got a big face in the game Sometimes I feel like fuck my life, I fuck with a few niggas that I know If my chick was a Shady ho? Niggas wouldn't think twice 'fore they fuck my wife Guess that's the difference in friends and associates, I done been broke I done been through the motions I don't pay no attention to birds, I use my scope and I tend to the vultures No one ever blows up your phone just to talk, I don't make money just to loan it to y'all Tell a nigga that then you wildin' is like dialin' and then talking to a hole in the wall Please look at these expenses, these niggas expensive If I gotta lend you money every time I see you just to be your friend bitch, I don't really need your friendship  [Hook: Claret Jai] Is everything not enough? What more can I give up? Is there anyone that I can trust? I give you my all and you still take from me I give and I give and you take and you take And you just walk away without nothing to say You just take from me..ay ay You just take from me..ay ay  [Verse 2: Eminem] I live in a bubble, I struggle with the fame Trouble is the pain grows double, give a fuck what you say When my music you take so subtle, just to give it away To people who don't even appreciate flows, mothafucka I'm livid today Cause I break my back to give you my art You steal my thoughts, it's like driving a spike through my heart You might not think it's that big of a deal to steal from me, but music's all I got Aside from my daughters, not to sound like a martyr, but it's getting harder than I thought To not just go crazy, trapped in this house, I'm about to just snap Am I not, deserving of what I got, did I not work for it? Put it all in every record I record Well then please tell me why on this Earth, Lord's it keep happening, I keep rapping, but I wonder sometimes is it worth all The bullshit, cause it feels like a down there ain’t no gettin up from But I won't let it get me down, I won't succumb I'm anything but glum so fuck 'em They'll appreciate me when I'm gone, they say it was ill, right? The way I killed mics? But the way I feel right now? It just feels like I'm so done with this shit that I may as well wipe I have nothing else to give you, nothing left to contribute Farewell I bid you, but before I go, my last gift to you Ladies and gentlemen, Slaughterhouse I give you!  via  http://genius.com/Bad-meets-evil-take-from-me-lyrics"

GuiltyPleasureMusic,3ct9k0,handasa_kravit,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:50:24 2015 UTC,"I was about to post this song today and saw that it would be a repost. This song is unbelievable, its like a mashup of death metal and Japanese pop."
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3cqjnb,Ajnin123,4,Thu Jul 9 23:43:53 2015 UTC,"I like this song, it's not even a guilty pleasure for me."
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3cqjnb,SnaeBjark,3,Fri Jul 10 01:08:40 2015 UTC,Just pleasure.
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3cqjnb,OrShUnderscore,5,Fri Jul 10 06:54:38 2015 UTC,Queen of the Clouds is beyond great! Same for the songs on her Truth Serum EP. I'd really recommend Tove Lo if you love pop music.
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3cqjnb,PrimeShard,2,Fri Jul 10 01:49:09 2015 UTC,She's my new favorite singer! My favorite song of hers has to be either Timebomb or Got Love
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3cqjnb,p0pcornball,2,Fri Jul 10 02:16:32 2015 UTC,Awesome! I can't pick a favorite song because I love them all but lately I've been hooked on Paradise and Over.
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3cqjnb,PrimeShard,2,Fri Jul 10 02:24:17 2015 UTC,This song is my jam and peanut butter.

GuiltyPleasureMusic,3cmno9,Eltrigga,3,Thu Jul 9 02:25:24 2015 UTC,"Yes!!! Unafraid to admit that I still jam out to this every once in a while. OP if you haven't heard it already, check out ""popular"" by them. I think it's pretty good."
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3cmno9,cincodelavan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:47:43 2015 UTC,Will do. :)

GuiltyPleasureMusic,3cj58l,tRoySniFF1,7,Wed Jul 8 09:05:17 2015 UTC,No need to feel guilty for liking this. Pet Shop Boys have had a lot of great songs.
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3cj58l,xo1998,2,Wed Jul 8 13:01:56 2015 UTC,Nobody doesn't like this song!
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3cixpg,MyTravelClips,2,Wed Jul 8 07:15:58 2015 UTC,Apparently this is the beat you're suppose to compress someones chest while giving CPR.
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3cjdjx,daiyenfooels,2,Wed Jul 8 11:01:54 2015 UTC,"So many parties in the 00s where everybody sang along to this song on the dancefloor, good times"

GuiltyPleasureMusic,3cbdo4,Slothman27,2,Mon Jul 6 16:19:06 2015 UTC,"I love how this plays during the tractor race in Footloose.  It was nonironic, I assume, so its a million times funnier."
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3cbenx,melodikos,0,Mon Jul 6 16:26:31 2015 UTC,Wrong sub? This is horrific. Just skip to Jump. Its just appalling. On every level.   (and i LOVED DLR and VH 'back in the day').
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3cbenx,easyjet,2,Mon Jul 6 21:29:29 2015 UTC,It is rare and in great quality. You don't like it but some others might like it.
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3c9agp,mdz1234,12,Mon Jul 6 02:25:09 2015 UTC,"Upvoting because i love the song, commenting because of my personal lack of guilt. I would say that the Tears for Fears version might be a better candidate."
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3c9agp,Quelano,11,Mon Jul 6 02:43:30 2015 UTC,"Just to complete the circlejerk conversation that always comes up with this song, I find the Tears for Fears version to be more interesting artistically, while this version strikes me as a bit more maudlin and one dimensional now.   That being said, neither is really a ""guilty"" pleasure to me."
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3c9agp,ucbiker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:49:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I agree with you. After writing this comment, i looked up the original on YouTube and found it to be very engaging. I would just be a little less likely to put that version on my radio show."
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3c9agp,Quelano,4,Mon Jul 6 23:10:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I love this song. Not guilty for me.
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3c9agp,ItzClobert,2,Mon Jul 6 03:10:11 2015 UTC,"Just saw Tears for Fears a few weeks ago and they played this (well, their original version anyway).  Both versions have appeal, but I have always preferred the original.  It was amusing to me though how many people in the audience did not know Gary Jules' version was not the original (ok it wasn't that many people but a few younger people near me)."
GuiltyPleasureMusic,3c9agp,Philo_T_Farnsworth,2,Mon Jul 6 19:16:47 2015 UTC,Isn't that crazy? Another weird one is when people don't know that Leonard Cohen wrote Hallelujah.
