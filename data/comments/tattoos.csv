tattoos,3e09lv,b_rite,11,Tue Jul 21 00:03:07 2015 UTC,this is sick man. I love this. What's the meaning behind it?
tattoos,3e09lv,The_Hermione_Granger,71,Tue Jul 21 04:41:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for asking. Some seriously self indulgent hippie shit coming your way.  浪人 or ""ronin"" (Japanese) was originally translated as ""wave man"" or someone who is drifting in life like a wave. A drifter. A wanderer. The samurai class adopted this term for someone who was released from service or their master was killed. Having no one to serve, they wandered as swords for hire.  As a martial artist who recently took multiple backpacking trips to Japan, this term has resonated with me ever since. Miyamoto Musashi was a ronin and has been one of my biggest inspirations for as long as I can remember both in business and martial arts. I speak Japanese, travel quite often, and am drawn to vagabonding like the samurai of old. This tattoo made perfect sense.  Like Musashi's ""The Way"", the brush strokes flow like life and time. On the other side, the ink splatter represents the chaos and unexpectedness of life. Otherwise, it conveys my love for Japan/Japanese, my commitment to jiu jitsu, and a time in my life where I was completely unfettered and free to roam.  I chose an authentically Japanese artist and initially flew to Japan to get this tattoo started but that's another story. This thing is dripping with authenticity.  Thanks for indulging me! I could talk about this piece for hours."
tattoos,3e09lv,heyfatheruncledad,6,Tue Jul 21 05:03:45 2015 UTC,Sounds sick man. I've always been a fan of this style. I've just never had the connection like you did.  I found my roots in American traditional and I'm going to see where it takes me.  I would get a tattoo like yours in a heartbeat though. I get sometime people get something that just looks cool. This one seems like something that resonates deep within you and further compliments your personality and style of life. Good job man. You enjoy it
tattoos,3e09lv,EndiaBanana,9,Tue Jul 21 05:18:57 2015 UTC,Very much so. My roommate and best friend that I grew up with came with me and got the same kanji characters tattooed on his arm by the same artist the day before. I did mine the following on my birthday. Something of a mark of brotherhood. Thing thing is definitely full of meaning.  Thanks for the kind words. You guys are getting me even more hyped about this tattoo.

tattoos,3e09lv,The-Disco-Phoenix,2,Tue Jul 21 07:55:52 2015 UTC,"Would love to hear the ""other story"" about going to Japan to get it started, if you've got time.  Also, how was the splatter done?  Did he just sketch it out on your leg first, free hand, or computer generated somehow and then transferred to stencil like most?"
tattoos,3e09lv,baked_brotato,2,Tue Jul 21 10:29:13 2015 UTC,"I love Japanese art, culture and language as well. I recently started learning Japanese myself. Also a huge fan of tattoos and would love to learn one of the martial arts some day. So this is certifiably awesome. And as many people here have told you, that tattoo is fucking sweet. The brush strokes and ink splatter look so real. This is making me giddy."

tattoos,3e09lv,Potatoes,3,Tue Jul 21 16:43:05 2015 UTC,I am absolutely obsessed with Vagabond right now. I just finished Vizbig's fourth volume. Did you read it's respective novel? Musashi by Eji Yoshikawa. Incredible book that was the entire reason I went to Japan for the first time. I even went to to Hachidai where Musashi prayed at the tree before taking on all of the Yoshioka school.  I like the cut of your jib.
tattoos,3e09lv,Jajebooo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:08 2015 UTC,Isn't Ronin also a samurai without a master? Not an authority on the subject but I remember seeing something about that at some point...

tattoos,3e09lv,Im_French,2,Tue Jul 21 15:00:00 2015 UTC,It's tough to read due to how stylized it is but at least it's the right kanji. Really fantastic tattoo man. It's almost hard to believe it's not real brush stroke.  Though Rounin also means some other stuff in modern day Japanese culture. :P

tattoos,3e09lv,Lord_Xp,28,Tue Jul 21 00:45:10 2015 UTC,this isn't simple... it is stylish... it does take up a lot of space.
tattoos,3e09lv,thunder216,5,Tue Jul 21 04:49:49 2015 UTC,"By ""a lot of space"" I mean tattos that take up 100% of the space and leave 0 skin visible, which I think make a way too oversaturated and complicated look. So yeah, this tattoo seems reasonably simple compared to full sleeve/back pieces."
tattoos,3e09lv,tedlasman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:00:53 2015 UTC,The reason this tattoo takes up a lot of space is because there is no way to fit in anything else near it. You could put tiny pieces in the swirls and brush strokes but that would be a terrible idea in my opinion and take away from the context of this piece. It uses his entire lower leg and should probably be left alone.
tattoos,3e09lv,ozora_lover,7,Tue Jul 21 11:05:28 2015 UTC,He nailed the brush strokes. I looked long and hard for someone who had this style down and Magu was a perfect fit for this!

It obviously won't be cohesive all the away through, but having some world class artists working on it is getting me closer.  Adam is one of the most underrated tattooers working right now. He is a true illustrator, kind, excited to work, and fair and honest. He could have a bigger ego and a different attitude of he chose to be ""that guy"", but he's humble and an all around good dude. Red Rocket kind of gets lost in the mix because of the high profile shops like Kings Ave, Sacred, Saved, Three Kings, but it's home to some of the best artists working.   As a former professional tattooer, I vet my shops very carefully. I chose to work with Adam because he not only has the skill, but the attitude that you want when tackling something like this.   Another ""big name"" tattooer, generally thought of as a top 10 in the world, took me on as a client and bypassed his multi year long waiting list due to some connections we had. Needless to say I'm not nearly as happy as I've been with the staff at Red Rocket. People get burned out. Not every idea excites every artist. Think big pieces through and choose wisely."

Then I said eff-it and went all in with the sleeve in 2006.  I take very good care of my work, SPF50 when working outside, try to keep it in the shade while driving, etc.  But, orange inks are notorious for dropping out over time, and my guy Chad has a new color he's pretty confident will hold up better.    In total, my sleeve/chest plate has been a work-in-progress that started in 2003, so 12 years of work that when healed will look like it was all completed at the same time.

tattoos,3dzap8,autechone,6,Mon Jul 20 22:42:38 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience with an artist here in Toronto at NYINK, i went in one day with all the images and references to what i wanted, and he said awesome he could do, show up for the appointment, dude doesn't recall anything, and said what i wanted to do wouldn't really work, rough sketches something and looks horrible.  It's incredibly frustrating when people do this."
tattoos,3dzap8,HelveticaBOLD,2,Mon Jul 20 20:45:27 2015 UTC,"Kinda same experience with my husband and I. When we lived in NoCal, pretty much one weekend every month we would reserve dates with our favorite artist and he would tattoo us the whole day. We love his work and he is very professional. However the last time we reserved dates, we brought in pictures of what we wanted and picked a date that gave him plenty of time to draw up our tattoos, paid our deposits to secure our appointment dates and everything. He was excited about doing the tattoos. Two weeks later, the day before our appointments he texts me to tell me he has to cancel cause he just found out his wife is pregnant. She was one of the artists in his shop and had to take a few days off so he had to take on her clients as well. No problem, I understood that and was more than okay with rescheduling. He reschedules us for 3 weeks later and tells us to come in on a certain day to check out our sketches. We go in that day and he tells us he never started them. Alright fine, we know he's busy with basically running the shop alone. The day before our rescheduled appointment, I get another text saying he has to reschedule us again because he found out they're expecting twins. Okay I'm a little annoyed at this point but whatever, he's the only guy I trust getting my ink from so he reschedules us for a month later. About a week before that next appointment, I get yet another text from him saying it will be a few months before he can get to us cause he is still taking his wife's clients. At this point I'm fed up and we go in and ask for our deposits back and he tells us that it's non refundable because it's to secure our appointment. We tell him we been waiting for our appointment to be secured for two months now and keep getting rescheduled. The girl he was currently tattooing mentions that she's been waiting for a month to get hers done. Which I didn't see as fair at all when we were strung along for longer than her and she got in before us. Then he tells me that my sketch is too complicated for him and he doesn't want to try it. Then he got pissed off and started talking shit about me when I decided to try out another artist and told me he could have done my tattoo all along."
tattoos,3dzap8,coreyz232,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:11:28 2015 UTC,"I had completely forgotten about this as it's been so long- but I also had a terrible experience with this dude. This was probably 2008 or 2009, he was working out of a small kinda crappy shop.  Buddy of mine was a friend of his and suggested I go to him for some work. Shop had a special that was like $600 for a half sleeve and I had commissioned art as a reference. Go in for the first sitting and the shop is just not clean at all. Should have called it off right there but had money in hand and wanted the piece. He knocked out a very poorly executed line art bit and stated he would finish after it healed. I had given him like $200 or $300 for that sitting, maybe 3 hours of work.   After it healed, I tried multiple times to make an appointment- which we had already previously agreed on. Finally showed up one night and he wasn't busy, so he said we could finish. I gave him the rest of the cash, another 3 hundred and he all the sudden had a family emergency. He used that cash to skip town and tried to completely ignore me. I called his manager at the time- she states she has no control over the situation, he was gone and nothing could be done. I even went so far as to track him down at his new shop and call that manager, just to inform them of what he had done. All the sudden he starts calling, imagine that. Coming up with empty promises and bullshit that he never intended on fulfilling. At the time I had no idea that guy was apparently some big name, never even seen the show he was on- but it looks like he flaked out on that as well.   Dude may produce some decent work, but not worth the hassle and bullshit of putting up with his attitude and lies. I hope this directly affects his shop and his bottom line so he can get to terms with the fact that the shit he does is not right. He still owes me $300 that I foolishly paid him and I already had someone who cares about a good reputation finish the travesty of a tattoo that he left."

I'm sure you probably dont even like the same things you yourself liked 4 years ago... you have many years of living ahead of you.  not a good idea"
tattoos,3e0srj,VeritasEnVino,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:33:19 2015 UTC,"36 year old present, I am SO glad I didn't do that. I can't even imagine how much I would hate it now."
tattoos,3e0srj,radiobaby,11,Tue Jul 21 19:00:29 2015 UTC,"I've known a few people who had a full sleeve at 21, and it was definitely a mistake. Your interests/tastes are probably going to change a lot in the next few years, you're going to make better money (most likely) for a better artist later on, and I'm also going to assume that you aren't already set in your career at 18. Lots of things are going to change. At the very least, jobs. Although tattoos in the workplace are much more common now, it's still not completely acceptable. I would say wait. Think about what you really want, out of the tattoo, out of your artist, out of yourself."
tattoos,3e0srj,aswespiral,4,Tue Jul 21 02:12:45 2015 UTC,"I agree but I'll add to this.  I have seen some 18 year old that get really nice sleeves done (parents pay for it kinda thing), but for the most part the tattoos were low budget.  Like you said his styles may change, but also I would wait until you can afford quality work.  I have some tattoos that were done spurt of the moment and the work is like a 6 out of 10 but I get the stupid shit like that on my thighs.  The arms where everyone can see, that work better be quality.  But yes like you said, not accepted everywhere.  I too would wait.  Fuck I'm 27 and most of my body is tattooed except for my arms for exactly the reason you stated."
tattoos,3e0srj,NinjaVanish666,2,Tue Jul 21 02:40:13 2015 UTC,"Definitely. That's what I mean by waiting till you can chose a better artist and have more money for quality work. You could get a whole sleeve for $50 probably, if you want some scratcher to do it in his kitchen. No thanks."
tattoos,3e0srj,aswespiral,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:45:15 2015 UTC,Nothing like some shit work that's with you for life.

tattoos,3e0srj,aswespiral,5,Tue Jul 21 02:54:24 2015 UTC,"I guess at that point I would think more about subject matter, is it going to be a sleeve of random shit you happen to be into or something more ""timeless"" (an ode to a passed family member, flowers, what have you). Also, what are you planning on doing for work. That question seems daunting to think about and will definitely change also. Are you willing to wear long sleeves to work everyday if need be?    I'd say if you're incredibly interested in getting more work, or a large piece, go with your back first. It hurts less, it'll cause you a lot less trouble in various ways and you still get the thrill/beauty of a nice large piece."
tattoos,3e0srj,Darcyjay_,2,Tue Jul 21 03:14:04 2015 UTC,"Alright I appriciate the advice, I plan on working in the psychology field, no idea what specifically if that means anything. And no I didnt plan on getting something specific, was just going to see what the artist suggested."
tattoos,3e0srj,Snerkie,3,Tue Jul 21 04:21:21 2015 UTC,"If you don't know your career, you don't know what you'll like in a few years. And a sleeve is hard to lazer/ cover-up. So unless you wanna get something blacked out in a few years..."
tattoos,3e0srj,Darcyjay_,3,Tue Jul 21 05:13:10 2015 UTC,"Seriously? There are 40 year olds that still don't know what their career is/should be, that doesn't mean it strikes out their tastes in things. That's two completely different things."
tattoos,3e0srj,Wanhope,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:14:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah and there's 40 year olds who regret their shitty tats too. I wasn't drawing a direct correlation, o was more hinting towards the fact this kid ain't got it all sorted out yet."
tattoos,3e0srj,Atroxian,6,Tue Jul 21 13:29:35 2015 UTC,"Waittttttttttt.  No one holds the same values between 18-21, and then 21-25.  You may end up with a great piece of art that you will love forever....or something that doesn't even represent what you want it to stuck on a huge portion of your body for 80% of your life.  Sleeves are awfully hard to cover up...just saying. If/when you decide to get one and you decide to start earlier than people here recommend, do so in parts and create a sleeve, so you have time to take a different direction if you need to.  An example: A friend of mine has been obsessed with various ancient Asian cultures since he was a child. Luckily someone hit him in the head hard enough that he didn't go get a bunch of script so he waited. Starting around 19 he got a self-designed Oni on his bicep, and slowly added a large chunk every year or so until now (age 24) that he has almost an entire sleeve perfectly filled. Stuck more or less with the same Asiatic folklore theme, but branched out and was able to afford extremely high (and progressively higher) quality art as he went, art that he was dead set on for years."
tattoos,3e0srj,JessBroBabe,5,Tue Jul 21 04:21:59 2015 UTC,"I, personally, would wait. However, I also believe that, even if your ideas and values change over time, tattoos are like little pushpins, marking off important times and things in your life. They're there for a reason, we GET them for a reason. So, yeah, you'll always have a reminder of something that was important enough for you to get a huge piece of artwork on your arm at that time.   So I guess my real advice is: consider the subject matter of this sleeve you're planning. What does it represent to you? Is it a depiction of a ""temporary"" thing, like a favorite movie/game/show/etc? Is it something that makes you happy/sad/emotional in some way? Is it ""just something pretty""? (There's nothing wrong with those kinda tattoos! Just be aware that not everyone agrees with you or me).   So I'd say just consider it carefully. Is it something you would consider waiting for, or do you want it RIGHT NOW? Then ask yourself, why exactly do you want it right now?  To me, the very best tattoos are the ones that make you think long and hard about them before AND after you get them!   (25 yrs old, I have 12 tattoos and one cover-up for a tattoo that was poorly inked and bled out badly/didn't look good anymore)."
tattoos,3e0srj,WaitingonDotA,3,Tue Jul 21 04:45:02 2015 UTC,"I am all for tattoos just for the hell of it, but when you're just 18 and it's only the second tat you have, I would suggest making it something that's meaningful to you, so in the future if you do regret, you'll at least understand why you did it, and maybe kick yourself less. And I read that you wanted to get it based on the career field you have chosen to work towards. That might very well change. When I was 18, I thought I wanted to do engineering, and am now doing pre-law 2 years later."
tattoos,3e0srj,rebelscumcsh,3,Tue Jul 21 04:46:21 2015 UTC,"I wanna say yes, but I got one at 17.  That being said I was already working in a job that I knew was the career I wanted, and my sleeve is based on working in kitchens which is all I've ever done. My advice is wait until you have a better understanding of who you are and what you dig."
tattoos,3e0srj,relmeyer,2,Tue Jul 21 05:00:48 2015 UTC,Yep.
tattoos,3e0srj,ks203530,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:52:02 2015 UTC,"depends on what you might want to do with your life and what artist you go to. You can get a full sleeve from someone like Thomas Hooper or Mutsuo ... or a full sleeve from some run-of-the-mill shop or in someone's bedroom.  keep in mind, times are changing"
tattoos,3e0srj,injeckshun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:19:43 2015 UTC,"Mistake. Started my left sleeve at 18. Didnt know shit about artists, design, anything. Parts i still like, but ive paid a ton to try and fix all the stupid shit. 11 years later, i started my right arm and am much happier with it. I would say that unless you REALLY want it...wait.   Its much better to just not have it than have something you are unhappy with later on.   You have your whole life to add to it...cant take it away (easily)"
tattoos,3e0srj,Nerogalaxy727272,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:48:32 2015 UTC,"Just my 2 cents since someone asked me about a sleeve this morning at work. I went to a tattoo expo this weekend and got 2 more tattoos. He asked me if I was going to get a full sleeve, and my response was "" I might, or might not, I think I'll just take it as it comes.""   Again just my $.02 but my preference is to get the tattoos as the idea comes to me instead of going to the shop and asking for a full space-themed sleeve or something. But again this is just my thoughts and I like to take it month by month instead of all at once"

tattoos,3e2lc9,kissmydrone,7,Tue Jul 21 13:56:42 2015 UTC,You should probably ask this in a different subreddit. The people who subscribe to /r/tattoos will probably all be fine with a tatted therapist.

tattoos,3e2lc9,KingstonVegeta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but its not entirely about her. The question is more about how would you feel as a patient / customer visiting her and seeing the tattoo."
tattoos,3e2lc9,alexcake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:35:04 2015 UTC,"If a person doesn't feel a connection to her as a psychotherapist, it probably has more to do with both of them as people and not the tattoo. I've seen a few therapists, and my current one dresses super whacky even though she's a 50-something yr old woman. I think it's awesome. Tattoos would not bother me as a patient."
tattoos,3e2lc9,KingstonVegeta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:38:09 2015 UTC,"Right. I personally would feel more comfortable because I'm into that kinda stuff and I understand what it means. However, someone who doesn't might take it very negatively, imo. At the same time, though I understand this is the career she chose, it'd be shitty if it completely kept her from getting the tattoo she wants. It's easy to hide if she decided it would get her in trouble."

Plus, as other commenters said, that tattoo is so small she could easily cover it with a watch during sessions if she was really worried."
tattoos,3e2lc9,TheEmpiresBeer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:51:46 2015 UTC,"I'd say a lot depends on the kinds of patients she works with. Are they the kind of people who would have an issue with a tattoo? (possibly for religious, cultural, or some mental issue?) Is she planning on getting the deathly hallows symbol? It isn't immediately recognizable as a book reference if you haven't read the books, so take that into account when thinking about reactions. Is potential client blowback about the tattoo going to be an issue for her or her boss? Or does she work with people who are all tatted up themselves and could connect to another tattooed person better?    Honestly, I would say get it some place else less visible if she's worried. It's not worth risking her safety or her job to get a wrist tattoo. Personally, I don't care if my therapist is tattooed or not as long as they can do their job well. But like /u/Roooobin said, the people on this sub are probably going to be more open minded about tattoos than your average person."

They were married for less than a month. His sleeve is being converted/ covered into a japanese theme. I do a lot of cover ups but this was one of the most challenging to date for sure.
tattoos,3duqjo,AngryWatchmaker,130,Mon Jul 20 00:58:01 2015 UTC,Married less than a month.    So the tattoo was more of a commitment than the marriage. At least he got something cool out of it in the end.

It just seemed to click for me that that was the style I wanted."

tattoos,3duvng,MiCK_GaSM,11,Mon Jul 20 02:23:10 2015 UTC,This isn't watercolor. This is splashes of color behind a photo-realistic image. Watercolor tattoos are made to mimic watercolor paintings.  It's a great helmet tattoo though.
tattoos,3duvng,stitchpirate,10,Mon Jul 20 00:36:34 2015 UTC,"I feel like there is a lot of misunderstanding of what watercolor art actually looks like.  I personally would rather this genre be called ""color splash"" tattoos or something like that.  It's not my taste either way, but to me this style and actual watercolor style are two different things.

tattoos,3duvng,poporook,5,Mon Jul 20 16:24:19 2015 UTC,The blotches of color are absolutely watercolor style tattooing. Watercolor tattoo are areas of colored pigment without a black outline.

Even if I didn't specifically ask for advice, I still don't see how it's polite or even healthy to possibly make someone feel self conscious about a permanent modification that will be on their body forever. I'm sitting here hating it and wishing it would disappear. Most subreddits with this type of niche would be like ""oh sweetie you should do this and this, that artist did sloppy work.."" And on top of that, even if you don't like the quality.. Why be rude to someone who is clearly excited? What do you gain from being rude other than coming off as an elitist. It was my first tattoo and I am fully aware it's not amazing, but why on earth do you all seem to think it's acceptable to act that way? I'm actually pretty sure you're breaking a sidebar rule."

I had a ton of people coming up thinking that Gwen from Painted Lotus did it. Kerri was sooooo happy about that because Gwen is her favourite artist.   It was also her first tattoo as an artist. She was there last year as an apprentice, but she is a full fledged artist now. So her first legit show and she wins an award. So proud of my girl."
tattoos,3dwg4p,fewdalord,2,Tue Jul 21 02:37:18 2015 UTC,Gorgeous

tattoos,3dzmxk,ChootyBandooty,3,Mon Jul 20 20:42:50 2015 UTC,"My advice? Either find a really good artist or drop the idea of a portrait. A caricature seems a little goofy to honor someone with too. I would suggest getting a tattoo of something that incorporates your friendship. Be it a physical object or just an ideal. Something that connects you two. I'm not saying don't get a portrait tattoo, because with a good artist they can turn out very, very nice. But if you're that worried about the quality, I'd avoid it. In the end my words shouldn't mean much to you; it is your body and you have your own style that you like and you make your own choices. I wish you luck!"
tattoos,3dzmxk,LightningFlashAsuna,3,Mon Jul 20 21:06:47 2015 UTC,"The thing is though is that I want a goofy tattoo because we've always been goofy and childish with each other and it would be fitting to our personal relationship. I understand where you're coming from though, thanks"
tattoos,3dzmxk,dalpaengee,2,Mon Jul 20 21:35:16 2015 UTC,"I agree about portrait tattoos in general, but I've seen some on here that are specific people but not in a realistic style (like this one that was just posted). Maybe pick a style you like and work with the artist to ensure it looks like/is a tribute to your friend?"
tattoos,3dzmxk,neoazayii,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:36:34 2015 UTC,You could try a traditional tattoo in the style of them? Someone posted something similar today; a traditional tattoo with traditional portraits in the style of his/her parents.
tattoos,3dzmxk,jepyang,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:19:42 2015 UTC,"If you want it to really look like your friend, it'll be easy to mess up whether it's a photorealistic portrait or a caricature. Your brain is hard-wired to remember important faces, so tiny details that are off really stand out.  Just go to a really talented artist no matter what you decide on and you'll be fine."

tattoos,3dwm2i,musiu,2,Mon Jul 20 12:02:15 2015 UTC,"It's going to connect to another peice in the future, and that'll more or less be a ribbon. Originally I was going to get this on my whole shoulder, back, and front, but the contours would make the lines look unstraight."
tattoos,3dwm2i,datoxic,2,Mon Jul 20 12:43:44 2015 UTC,"very nice idea, but to be honest some lines could be a bit more straight."

tattoos,3dz1pg,rebelliousthoughts,6,Mon Jul 20 18:12:36 2015 UTC,"If it were me, I'd go. Just keep it clean, keep up with aftercare, keep it covered when in the sun, and it should be fine. If you want to ride the rides, go ahead. The tattoo won't go flying off.   If long sleeves will just be too brutally hot...I usually get a pair of tights, cut the legs off measured to the length of my arm, and use that to keep forearm tattoos covered. The material breathes well and doesn't stick to the skin.   I'm getting work done on my arm tomorrow...will definitely be doing this when I'm outside."
tattoos,3dz1pg,kathompson,5,Mon Jul 20 18:26:00 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine going on rides. Keep it covered for sun protection (but don't wrap it tight with an ace bandage, just wear sleeves). Also don't go swimming because that might mess it up."
tattoos,3dz1pg,Lstn2TownesVanZandt,3,Mon Jul 20 18:50:17 2015 UTC,You are for sure over-thinking it. Your tattoo isnt going to go anywhere. Keep it clean. Wash it. Enjoy your vacation.
tattoos,3dz1pg,Eulogy311,2,Mon Jul 20 21:14:23 2015 UTC,"The main thing here is to keep the area nice and clean. If you can do that, you'll be good to go! Protection from the sun is a must.   Enjoy your vacation!"
tattoos,3dz1pg,sitarguitar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:29:48 2015 UTC,"Like everyone said, best to keep it clean as your wound is still relatively fresh, but it shouldn't be too big of an issue. Also keep it out of the sun as much as possible."

tattoos,3dyt5o,iamsuperstarr,2,Mon Jul 20 17:34:12 2015 UTC,"Nope, not weird at all. I also give the artist a bunch of freedom when getting a flash piece done, though. Makes it more fun for everyone."
tattoos,3dyt5o,tomatosauce24,2,Mon Jul 20 18:54:38 2015 UTC,"You know the funny thing is I've seen too many episodes of Miami/LA/NY Ink where I feel like it's more normal to walk in and ask for a custom design than ask for flash haha, but yea why not? A lot of artists churn out a lot of flash sheets, some of which sport some pretty awesome designs."

tattoos,3dsspd,inannaofthedarkness,4,Sun Jul 19 15:01:05 2015 UTC,Yea!! I've seen some people mention carrying sunscreen sticks with them 24/7 so if they wind up in the sun they can cover their tattoo quickly.  I love that idea personally!

tattoos,3dy2dr,VolePix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:05:18 2015 UTC,"A second peel is normal; although, I will say my inner wrist/forearm was definitely a bit different than upper arms. The skin in that area is a lot thinner and does seem to take longer to heal up properly (at least in my experience). Most important thing right now is to keep sunscreen on it if you're going outside.   If you're scabbing up that means you've probably been using too much ointment, try going easier on it. You shouldn't have to put much on at all by now, maybe once or twice a day max."
tattoos,3dy2dr,Doktor_Dysphoria,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:20:48 2015 UTC,I've mostly just been using lotion and sunscreen on it at this point. Occasionally a tiny bit of aquaphor if it feels dried out and I don't have access to lotion.

I just wouldn't want to get an average sized tattoo but then my arm grows a bunch and the tattoo stayed the same size and it would look small.

tattoos,3dx8p7,uWheaties,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:34:11 2015 UTC,Err. Go to Wal-Mart or walgreens and getcha some tattoo goo for $15 its by the pharmacy. You need to be putting some non scented soap on that and tattoo goo includes that.
tattoos,3dx8p7,Comictatt,2,Mon Jul 20 20:10:34 2015 UTC,"Wait 1 month until it's fully heald, and go for touch ups if necessary"
tattoos,3dx8p7,jepyang,2,Mon Jul 20 09:51:59 2015 UTC,No way to know till it heals. The first week after getting a tattoo is when it'll look the worst; don't sweat it yet.
tattoos,3dx8p7,soynutts,0,Mon Jul 20 10:19:28 2015 UTC,alrighty :-(
tattoos,3dx8p7,beileen8,2,Mon Jul 20 13:35:11 2015 UTC,"What I go by is usually: ""too bright, too light, just right"". So basically, when you get it done it's really bright, then it fades during the healing process, then it ends up being just right once it's healed.  Touch-ups might be required in some cases, but either way, don't worry about anything until it's completely healed.  As for care, I wash wash them in the shower with a mild soap, pat it dry and then apply Aveno (basic one, no perfumes) on it. I keep it hydrated by applying the cream 2-3 times a day and you should be all set."

tattoos,3dub63,eutie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:57:11 2015 UTC,"It is not a roman numeral 10, it's the symbol for the band Circa Survive. I have been asked that several times tho so I guess I'll be explaining that again lol."
tattoos,3dub63,yosoymilk5,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:14:23 2015 UTC,"It's actually an old hobo symbol IIRC. Still a cool concept, and I recognized it."
tattoos,3dub63,yosoymilk5,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:48:03 2015 UTC,what is that ?
tattoos,3dub63,darktype,2,Sun Jul 19 19:41:00 2015 UTC,Hobos place them in cities as messages for other hobos.  See here  It seems Circa Survive derived theirs from the 'Safe Camp' symbol.
tattoos,3dub63,NotFlexing,2,Sun Jul 19 20:03:40 2015 UTC,"They did indeed. When they released the album Blue Sky Noise, it came with some extra acoustic songs which were part of their ""Safe Camp Sessions"" as they called it. The symbol seemed to stick for a lot of people, I think it looks cool as well :)"

tattoos,3dub63,TaylorSwiftIsJesus,2,Mon Jul 20 13:26:45 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure that's supposed to be ""wait"""

tattoos,3dub63,Viking84,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:44:21 2015 UTC,"are you saying that using the word "" waits "" is not correct ?  /u/TaylorSwiftIsJesus"
tattoos,3dub63,CunArtist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:27:40 2015 UTC,"Technically due to the presence of a compound subject in the sentence, the verb should be conjugated as though the noun phrase is plural, which in this case would be 'wait'. So ""Time waits for no man"", but ""Time and tide wait for no man"".  TBF it's a pretty minor error and compound/subject agreements can be ambiguous (although not really in this case)."

tattoos,3dvg69,ButtPeppers,7,Sun Jul 19 21:23:49 2015 UTC,"It's like getting someone to redraw the Mona Lisa, it will never be 100% the same, so some artists prefer to give the original artist the respect to not try and replicate their work.  That being said, references are fine and probably encouraged because it helps your artist to come up with a design more towards what you had in mind, unless you're going to that artist for their particular style in which that would be a different story.  Once again all of this is highly subjective, it really depends on your artist."
tattoos,3dvg69,iamsuperstarr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:41:48 2015 UTC,Good point. Thanks!
tattoos,3dvg69,deadbeareyes,5,Sun Jul 19 22:54:41 2015 UTC,I would imagine there is a difference in asking an artist to copy another artists work and just using the picture as a reference for style or ideas.
tattoos,3dvg69,beileen8,2,Mon Jul 20 02:54:19 2015 UTC,I usually give my artist a couple of pictures of tattoos to use as reference.
tattoos,3dvg69,hangm4n,2,Mon Jul 20 05:30:56 2015 UTC,"no, not at all, it should be about creating the work that you will be the happiest with. A good tattoo artist will ask for as much information as they can so they can form in their minds eye the drawing they want to put on you.  Having said that copying over other artists work is bad work ethic in my eyes."

tattoos,3dsy3p,ButterflyAttack,2,Sun Jul 19 10:43:24 2015 UTC,"Actually in the Navy...but both grandparents served in WWII.  I dig the style - Norman Rockwell-esque, WWI/II propaganda poster, etc. - and both the dogs I have are little tanks.  Thought it was a cool idea.  The other side of my ribs I have a girl riding an old general purpose bomb."
tattoos,3dsy3p,ButterflyAttack,2,Sun Jul 19 14:12:53 2015 UTC,"That's great, yeah - I can really see the propaganda stylee there, love it. In fact, I have a friend who is into sustainability and farming who has part of the 'Mend and make do to save buying new' poster. Me, I'd prefer ' Dig for victory!'"

The strangest thing was that my cat was the fattest, laziest cat, and I didn't know how he could catch the lizards. Once I caught him laying in the driveway and the lizards actually were crawling over him. It was like they were magnetized to him. So odd."
