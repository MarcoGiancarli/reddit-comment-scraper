Edit:  What I mean by this is  ""guy appears in front of Megaton, gives him 7 armored suits for repair. ""  The wording of this sentence is so awful that an uninformed reader would be unable to tell WHO is giving to WHOM.  also ""merchant repair is in a second"".  Just atrocious.  This coupled with the misspellings is why I said OPs english needs work.   And no, intentionally fucking up the english is not part of the style of this kind of narrative.

LifeasanNPC,3cdlgj,Godzilla2y,16,Tue Jul 7 02:13:23 2015 UTC,I love wiping out the slavers in Paradise Falls. Never sneak my way in or try and bribe the guard. I just let him know I'm shutting the place down and waste them all.   Well written story by the way. I normally used Cross as my companion and Jericho when I was being evil. How useful is Clover? I think the reason I don't like her is that her name makes me think of that Tommy James song
LifeasanNPC,3cdlgj,Inteliguard,16,Tue Jul 7 03:56:23 2015 UTC,"This is actually my first serious playthrough of FO3, so it was the first time I've been to paradise falls.  I normally play half of the main story, do one or two of the DLCs, and then get bored and go to a new game.  This time I'm trying to do as many quests as I can, so I wanted to see what quests were available in Paradise Falls. The slavers make it pretty apparent that they think they're hot shit, though, and I didn't have any interest in collecting twenty broken Chinese assault rifles, so it seemed pretty necessary to free the slaves and raze the town. I managed to purchase Clover beforehand on accident, but I'm glad I did, as it offered this funny experience.   The issue I have with both Cross and Jericho is that they're so whiney.  Cross bitches every time I step on some cans on the ground, and Jericho kept complaining that I wasn't badass enough, even though I had to keep saving his ass whenever talon company mercs showed up.   Clover only seems moderately useful so far. I definitely wouldn't have her as a companion if I could only have one, but maybe I like Fawkes too much to make a proper judgement. With multiple companions it starts being less about ""How useful is X character by themselves"" and more about ""How many bodies can I enlist in the Reptar army?"".   Crimson and Clover... Over and over..."
LifeasanNPC,3cdlgj,Inteliguard,4,Tue Jul 7 05:02:16 2015 UTC,I'm actually just in the midst of another FO3 play though and I ended up killing bother her and Crimson when I stormed Eulogy's pad. Had that dam song stuck in my head for ages.   And I agree with Cross being a little annoying. I just tend to take her because I like to roleplay and I couldn't take Fawkes because I figured most Wastelanders would shoot any Super Mutant who tried to follow the Lone Wanderer into town.
LifeasanNPC,3cdlgj,stanleyfarnsworth,4,Tue Jul 7 05:14:58 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying. I figure if word of my existence is broadcast hourly on the radio, though, there would be enough news via word-of-mouth that a non-hostile Super Mutant traveled with me and that I wasn't afraid to mow down literally a whole town if I had to (see: Raven Rock, Paradise Falls, etc.) that they'd know to leave Fawkes alone."

LifeasanNPC,3bnb1h,bowers12,5,Tue Jun 30 22:14:09 2015 UTC,It just puts all FO3 (including dlc) as a mod on NV and you can start wherever you want (mojave or DC) and there is a train so you can switch maps without problems   To be honest the only thing complicated is installing it since you need to have FO3 fully downloaded and needs to create the mod from scratch using your game and sometimes the installer looks like it crashed but is still working

LifeasanNPC,3bb9ug,TheMisneach,6,Tue Jun 30 15:51:59 2015 UTC,I learned several different ways to level skills today. Today was a good day.
LifeasanNPC,3bb9ug,fbholyclock,3,Sat Jun 27 19:56:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the OP pre-faced this with ""and to take a crack at creating an optimized character""  In Oblivion, since your level goes up when your primary skills go up, but your attributes level up, well, mostly based on how much your secondary stats increase, if you want to play as a mage, roll a fighter. If you want to play as a fighter, roll as a mage. Once your secondary skills have been increased to the point where a level up will give you the maximum/optimal skil point gain, then level up a primary skill (somethign you wouldn't accidentally use)   Since monsters in crease in level with you, this keep you way ahead of the curve. If you just level up your primary skills, IMO, the game actually gets more and more difficult, instead of the other way around.   Which is also why the NPC's are observing the OP do things repeatedly for hours on end."
LifeasanNPC,3bb9ug,Auroness,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:24:48 2015 UTC,"Great explaination.  Yes, i refer to all the boring repetition as ""grinding"" because it's tedious work but worth the payoff.  I am a level 27 orc and I am nearly indestructible.  In fact, I don't even fight enemies in oblivion gates anymore because all of my stats are so maxed that it is a waste of time.  I fly past them at 50 miles an hour and take the sigil stone.  I can literally leap over  enemies heads."

EVE players can help their soldiers with orbital bombardments from their ships.  Unfortunately, by most accounts, it's not terribly good."

LifeasanNPC,3743ki,StewieTheThird,2,Sun May 24 18:17:27 2015 UTC,This is chilling and really good.
LifeasanNPC,3743ki,iStayGreek,5,Mon May 25 04:35:49 2015 UTC,"This might actually be a really good cannon explanation for how shit went down.  Ares is deliberately weakened to the point terrifying monster-man Kratos can kill him (or Kratos is bumped up to near godhood to do so) by Zeus. However it has unforseen consequences in that the entire city who sees, and anyone who hears of it, is thrown into complete doubt about the gods.  In an awful lot of stories, Gods power and strength is directly related to mortals belief in them.  So by the time Kratos starts a-murderin',  all the gods are significantly weaker than they should be because no one believes they're immortal and all powerful any more (By contrast the Titans don't rely on mortal belief and are simply colossally powerful forces of nature) and Kratos may be even more powerful than before because some mortals believe he is more powerful than a god, rather than gods being as weak as men."
LifeasanNPC,3743ki,boomsc,2,Mon May 25 12:43:02 2015 UTC,"As for killing Ares, Kratos was granted the power of a god through Pandora's box, not to mention that in GoW 2 we find out that Kratos is the son of Zeus granting him demigod status from birth. On top of all of that the gods were constantly giving him powers and weapons not meant for mortal men. Those three things gave him the edge he needed to kill Ares.   As for the rest of the gods your theory holds up. AFAIK The gods do draw their power from the devotion of the humans. So when they watch a man kill their god they doubt the absolute omnipotence of the Gods in favor of Kratos."
LifeasanNPC,370iod,Scherazade,30,Sat May 23 18:55:55 2015 UTC,"It's always refreshing to see a different game than the usual be utilized. Props for Fable, one of the best games in my opinion. I hope to hear more about krunk and his misadventures along with the guild fixing it."
LifeasanNPC,370iod,Orintur,23,Sat May 23 19:34:03 2015 UTC,"Stoked to see Fable here. Great game. The sequels were okay too but it was all about the original.  Got a good couple of laughs, thanks OP."
LifeasanNPC,370iod,modernbenoni,14,Sat May 23 19:39:07 2015 UTC,"Fable was the peak of my childhood gaming experiences, the progression of the series however was one of the most disappointing."
LifeasanNPC,370iod,FearLeadsToAnger,18,Sat May 23 21:37:42 2015 UTC,"Ah, 2 and 3 were decent games. They just had a tough act to follow. Super disappointing at the time though. Fable introduced me to rpgs really and in a big way."
LifeasanNPC,370iod,modernbenoni,7,Sat May 23 22:58:20 2015 UTC,"That's true, I think if they could've just preserved and expanded the magic system a little better that would've been enough to save them, in my mind."
LifeasanNPC,370iod,FearLeadsToAnger,5,Sat May 23 23:11:02 2015 UTC,Also not made it possible to just spam magic until you win. It was fun to not do that sometimes though. Challenge yourself and all.
LifeasanNPC,370iod,modernbenoni,3,Sat May 23 23:20:28 2015 UTC,"Really the only thing that put me off the sequels is the lack of heart to them. 2 starts off with the main character being pooped on, and the final fight will get killstealed by one of the NPCs easily.  3, I haven't tried, but I've heard the conflict between preparing for the upcoming Doom Monster of Doom and keeping your citizens happy is a pain in the ass, and it might feel like you're a better person for being a cruel bastard just to prepare for the evil.  Now, that doesn't mean Fable 1 doesn't have its problems, believe me, it did. Parts of the game were just downright bizarre, there was so much that was inaccessible and then released anew in a full price copy later, but there were very few moments where it felt like it was directly sticking a finger up at the players.  1 was pretty harmless as fantasy games go. If anything, it is a stripped down version of all the fantasy games in existence, with the Hero's Journey archetype being followed to the tee."
LifeasanNPC,370iod,modernbenoni,3,Sun May 24 13:26:31 2015 UTC,"3 is better than 2 IMO. They just weren't the same. I did enjoy the story through them all though. It's hard to pin down exactly what was great about 1, which makes it hard to say what the sequels were missing IMO. Fable 1 had heart for sure though, what ever that means technically."
LifeasanNPC,370iod,modernbenoni,9,Sun May 24 17:38:30 2015 UTC,"Trivia: Krunk is what I usually call the main character of Fable 1 since there was a supposed cheat for the game where if you named your savegame Krunk, it would have some sort of effect. It genuinely does not have any effect that I know of, but let's face it, the mute character does look like a Krunk."

A conversation took place in low voices, so brief and quiet that I heard none of it. A moment of silence........and then it began   Skipping through the conversation?   ....dropped into a fighting crouch..........and promptly disappeared, as if she became one with the night.   The Sneak perk at level 100(?)   The I heard the noise, like a terrific wind had been stirred up.....but the trees were not swaying and there were no leaves blowing.   Elemental Fury?"

LifeasanNPC,34vgn0,SphereofWreckening,18,Mon May 4 22:05:15 2015 UTC,This is Matt Kermin with green pint weekly. Can you tell us how the kerbal-nauts are handling the unbearable sexual tension between bob and Valentina while Bill quietly pines for bob? Also wouldn't it be possibly to ram another ship into the one orbiting the solar system and nudge the lost crew back into a safer orbit?
LifeasanNPC,34vgn0,Frug_the_Barbarian,13,Mon May 4 22:50:23 2015 UTC,"To answer the topic of the sexual tension; often when Kerbalnauts of different genders are being sent out on missions, there is usually a form of training that goes along with these mission. Nicknamed ""Abstinence Training"" by some of our psychologists, it deals with any ahem  inappropriate thoughts or actions that may occur during a mission. Most shuttles are built with a private room capable of holding one Kerbal until they can relieve themselves of any thoughts they may have about a crew member.   However, while this form of training usually works for Men who are attracted to Women, the same is not true for Men who are attracted to Men. We were unaware of Bill's orientation, and as a result we could not give him the proper training to cope. That is not to say that we are against having anyone openly or closely homosexual on our team, but it can make situations more stressful when we do not have all of our bases covered.  As for your second question; we are actually completely unaware of how orbit in the solar system was achieved. While the ship was in orbit around Kerbin and Mun, it somehow slipped out into the solar system; beyond anyone's comprehension. So, as of right now, our team continues to research the exact reason for this occurence, while also searching for solutions to save our trapped Kerbalnauts."
LifeasanNPC,34vgn0,Frug_the_Barbarian,8,Mon May 4 23:26:55 2015 UTC,Follow up question from Andre Kermin with fash-min weekly wasn't it obvious that bill was a ker-Men sexual seeing as throughout his training he dressed extremely well and made mojitos for the crew brunch every day? And how could you the leading authorities on space travel in the known universe know nothing about the basic laws of space travel? Is it because maybe your lead scientist was wearing a disgraceful shirt adorned with animated kerbal women?
LifeasanNPC,34vgn0,TrudlandKeeper,11,Tue May 5 00:29:38 2015 UTC,"Bill's Ker-Men sexuality was always rumored, but you must understand that in the professional center that is the Turd Ferguson in Association with Crap NASA, we do not take rumors at face value. Demanding an answer from Bill would have been extremely invasive on his life, and while it ultimately would have helped to know his sexuality, we also have to be considerate towards the Kermin on the other side of the spacesuit. They are not guinea pigs, they feel, know, have consciousness. We do not take tampering with Kermin life lightly, and that is why we are doing everything within our power to rescue the men and woman on Project Possibility.  As for the second question, the laws of space are not written in stone. Everyday leads to a new discovery, a new piece to a new spaceship to land on a new planet. To claim that our organization is anything less then the best in space travel is completely false.   The TFACNASA is responsible for such breakthroughs such as the Suck It v1 and v2, the Not Space Plane Mk I-XIV, the Can't Possibly Fail vI Mk I-III, the Can't Possibly Fail v2 I-VII, the Challenger Class M Mk I-XII, and most recently the Leviathan vI Mk I.   Each innovation comes with new knowledge of space, such as the fact that orbit exists, which is one of our biggest discoveries to date!  In closing, we do not appreciate having out Organization slandered under the pre-tense of mediocrity. Also, the scientist shirt fiasco has been long since rectified after several Human Resources meeting, and we hope that we can soon put that whole scandal behind us."
LifeasanNPC,34vgn0,Dirty_Socks,3,Tue May 5 01:09:31 2015 UTC,Matt Kermin: Asking the important questions here.
LifeasanNPC,34vgn0,josephdevon,13,Mon May 4 23:12:32 2015 UTC,"Hello, Beek Kerman from the Kerbal Times here. Do you have any comments about the whereabouts of the enigmatic Jebidiah Kerman? Is it true that he owns the combination junkyard/spaceship parts facility that helped create this mission?  And furthermore, what kind of internal investigation can we expect to see from the debacle that was the Snacks Appropriation Act of last year? Is it true that snacks will continue to be rationed?"
LifeasanNPC,34vgn0,josephdevon,10,Tue May 5 02:05:30 2015 UTC,"Jebidiah Kerman's whereabouts are currently known to the TFACNASA, however we refuse to comment on any possible space or side missions he may be working on as of right now. But do note that what he is doing is one of the top priorities for the TFACNASA.  While Jebidiah is one of the founding members of the TFACNASA, the current owner or our organization is the mysterious billionaire Turd Ferguson, who continued to donate and fund us, even after all of our original backers opted out after the disasters that were the Can't Possibly Fail vI-vII missions.  The Snack Appropriation Act was passed in order to secure comfort food for our Kerbalnauts, and currently is the only food source found on the Project Possibility Mk I. Doing this was a way to ensure that the Kerbalnauts had something that would help them deal with the highly stressful situation of their jobs. As of last year, however, it had come to the TFACNASA's attention that several members had been hoarding snack foods that were meant for space missions. Most of the men responsible were court marshaled, and several of them charged with Treason against Kerbin. You can expect to see a more transparent program in giving snack foods to the astronauts. We now have an automated system that most Kerbals can check to see how we are dealing with the snack foods in real time!  With that being said, the snack foods will continued to be rationed, and at this time more-so then ever. We are aware that the SAA was highly unpopular in passing, but with the scientific breakthroughs made within the last few days, everyone needs to understand that there will be more space missions. And with more space missions, comes more science."
