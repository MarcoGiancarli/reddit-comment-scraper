We shouldnt forget that Chambliss sis the same thing in 2002 to his opponent Mac Cleland, who lost 3 limbs in Vietnam, a war Chambliss sat out with deferments.   Chambliss's campaign used the refrain of national defense and security, but drew criticism for television ads that paired images of Cleland and Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, and for questioning the commitment to homeland security of his opponent, a triple amputee and decorated Vietnam veteran.[1][2] Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona said of one ad, ""It's worse than disgraceful, it's reprehensible.""[3] McCain, along with Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, made significant complaints to the Republican National Committee until the ads were taken down   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_Georgia,_2002  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A14474-2002Jun19.html  Chambliss is a bottom feeder and should be dismissed as such."

People like Cheney, and Ted Nugent. Or Mitt  ""Missionary in France"" Romney being all tough guy about the mideast.  One can still call Vietnam an illegal war, or a horrible war and still  respect our family members and friends who responded to the call, and went there (or Iraq or Afghanistan), at great sacrifice to themselves and their families.

Chambliss on the other hand is in a long line of politicians from Georgia who decided a good way to get elected was to run attack ads saying that Cleland doesn't have a purple heart because his wounds were self inflicted as if the man deliberately blew his arm and legs off because he was a coward.

inthenews,3e1szq,wiggty,4,Tue Jul 21 12:38:55 2015 UTC,"http://www.npr.org/2015/05/10/405624427/flawed-intelligence-in-the-war-of-our-time  MARTIN: This was not a CIA program, but you were brought into this because President Obama asked you to be part of the review program. You write in the book that Edward Snowden contributed to the rise of ISIS. What evidence do you have to show that?  MORELL: So I can't get into specifics, but I'll tell you that there was a program that he disclosed that was vital to the United States' ability to see what terrorists are doing. And they all changed their communication habits because of that disclosure - al-Qaida in Pakistan, al-Qaida in Yemen and al-Qaida in Iraq, which morphed into ISIS. So there is no doubt in my mind that that change in behavior on the part of al-Qaida in Iraq and ISIS contributed to ISIS's rise. I'm not the only one to believe that. Nonpartisan senior kind of terrorism officials in our government have testified to Congress that they share that view.  MARTIN: That is also a convenient argument because, I mean, this was the worst intelligence leak in history, as you point out. And to then blame this man, Edward Snowden, on the rise of ISIS, in some way frees the CIA and perhaps other parts of the U.S. intelligence community from predicting the rise of ISIS. Does the CIA bear some responsibility in that, in not seeing that?  MORELL: So a very fair question, a very fair question. And I don't mean to imply it was the only factor, right, behind ISIS's rise. There were many, many factors behind ISIS's rise - the U.S. leaving Iraq and not leaving a stay-behind force, former Prime Minister Maliki's misbehavior with regard to the Sunnis, his disenfranchisement of them, the Civil War in Syria, right and all of the weapons that were available led to the rise of ISIS. So a lot of things led to the rise of ISIS."

No one will be able to purchase the goods and services whose profits benefit the richest few.    One of the things that most who oppose ""income redistribution"" miss is that no one is suggesting that those who make middle and upper middle class incomes give more than they are already giving.  What they are seeking is taking the edge off people like the Kochs, Waltons, and truly wealthy people whose pursuit of more money is no longer about being secure or comfortable, it is purely just about MORE MORE MORE, while their employees and those who actually produce the wealth get LESS LESS LESS.  No one is even suggesting that these wildly wealthy people be disallowed from becoming even MORE fabulously wealthy, they are simply suggesting that, once a person has accumulated enough wealth for many generations of their offspring to be as wealthy as royalty, their tax rate could be higher than those who work for them.  It isn't theft, it's asking someone who has benefited from the profit-conducive society in which they have become fabulously wealthy to PAY for that same profit-conducive society a little more than those who earn only a middle-class income. It really isn't as onerous as the article and most of the commenters make it out to be, but one can't be taken seriously if one's position isn't on the outer edge of one pole or another.

The idea that Ellen somehow defended the community by keeping coontown while banning FPH is so utterly ridiculous.  I personally didn't like how the front page was taken over by FPH but I didn't like the censorship either and especially didn't like how the attack on the community was carried out. If any of what they've said about their reasons were true they could simply have taken the offending subs off the front page and I have to say I wondered why they hadn't already in the weeks before the attack. This whole thing is so obviously about something entirely different and Ellen is just some convenient bean bag.

The video of her arrest shows that they abused her in a way that fits the pattern of how police arrest black people but usually not white people.  And the reason she was still in jail 3 days later, for a mere traffic stop (failing to signal when changing lanes), is because they charged her for the rough way in which they arrested her in the first place - another thing that police do an awful lot more to blacks than to whites."

inthenews,3di601,In_The_News,2,Fri Jul 17 05:45:56 2015 UTC,Point taken. Thanks for the rare Reddit intelligent response.
inthenews,3di601,fionnintime,0,Thu Jul 16 21:02:17 2015 UTC,"That isn't entirely true, though.  If you look at the raw numbers, police shoot more white people than black people.  When you look at the proportions, minorities end up with a higher ratio.   If 1 of every 100 white people are shot by police, and there are 1,000,000 white people, that's 10,000 people.  If 5 (five times greater than the number of whites shot) of every 100 black people are shot by police, but there are only 100,000 black people, that's 5,000 - half the number of white people shot every year by police.  The percentages could be higher, but the raw numbers are a different story. So it all depends on how you want to look at ""more"" in terms of who is being shot by police.    And, the national media doesn't give as much press to non-minorities shot by police. A great example is Gilbert Collar, an 18-year-old white student at the University of South Alabama, was shot and killed while naked, unarmed and under the influence of drugs by a black police officer.  The officer, Trevis Austin, was cleared of wrongdoing in 2013 by a Mobile County grand jury in a case that received little media coverage outside Alabama. Collar’s parents filed a federal lawsuit last year against the officer."
inthenews,3di601,omniron,3,Thu Jul 16 14:29:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure anyone would disagree with you, but this misses the point. There are a lot of white people. I am one. I have zero fear that the police will hurt me unless I intentionally put myself on their radar. There are not that many black people. The ones that are here have a decent chance of getting hurt by police even if they do nothing wrong. This woman is an example of that."

That is not where help is needed and not a way that God really apperciates. Wasting her life? Why?
inthenews,3di601,altrocks,4,Thu Jul 16 15:38:51 2015 UTC,"Black shootings don't get coverage unless civil rights organizations organize protests. Black people protesting gets media attention then they are forced to cover why they are protesting. It's a formula that's been working since the 1950s.  If white victims of police brutality aren't getting the attention they deserve, I recommend working with civil rights organizations to organize protests. Hell, getting the white kid's death covered will probably force more major change than any 10 black deaths."

Online bullying? What even is that? You can not bully someone online. The only way that could even happen is if something is done in the real world first. IE naked photos or doxxing with the purpose of doing something to someone. No one is that fragile. You couldn't say anything to me online to cause me any stress. I would like to think that people are stronger than that and maybe just maybe the tumblr eye contact man spreading trigger rape team are trolling as well. How do you even function in the real world when strangers can hurt your feelings?
