If you just want the most cost effective genuine Mac I guess get a Mac Mini.  If you want a MacBook, get one and use the TweleveSouth Arc Stand to stand it up, lid closed, on its side. You can then get a powered USB hub and connect all peripherals to it, then connect the hub to a USB switcher and connect one cable to the Mac and one to the PC. But then again having thought of it, I've never dealt with 2 monitors before. I connect my PC via DP-MiniDP and my MacBook via MiniDP-DP so I just switch using the monitor's controls."

I would also recommend, (and I can't for the life of me think of what its called), a thing for your keyboard and mouse considering they are USB/PS2 (if they are bluetooth there isn't much need) which then plugs into both your pc and mac so you don't need to unplug and move things around similar to the HDMI switcher.

However, there can and probably will arise some issues along the way, either small or big. I had a hackintosh before, and it was all good before I found out it couldn't support my 4k monitor at 60z refresh rate, so after weeks of trying hard to get it to work, I just gave it up, said fuck it and bought a MacBook which is foolproof. Although there's a place and time for buying a Hackintosh, there is something to be said for buying an Apple Product which is more or less guaranteed to work straight out of the box. Also, you don't have to worry about updates.  If hackintosh is your thing though, it can be great value for the buck.

To date, I've had zero support calls from them, and have only had a minor issue with my own (AMD GPUs are a pain to get working, theirs had integrated graphics which never have issues).  A few years ago I found myself in a similar position -- I was working for a small company and was using their loaner MBP as my main machine, but I ended up leaving and had to give it back. Hackintoshs are MUCH cheaper than a 'real' mac, so being a huge nerd I decided to give it a try. Long story short, I was able to build an i5 3.5GHz, R9 290, 8TB of storage beast for under $1k. A similar apple rig would have easily cost me twice as much.  It's true that hackintoshes take work, but if you like to tinker with tech it shouldn't be an issue. My advice is to follow the suggested parts guides here. To actually get everything working, I highly suggest using this guide, anything else will likely result in a headache later down the line: www.tonymacx86.com/yosemite-desktop-guides/144426-how-install-os-x-yosemite-using-clover.html  If you run into any trouble, check out /r/hackintosh, it's a great community and people are usually willing to help out."

macsetups,3dnbs8,KZISME,6,Fri Jul 17 17:46:28 2015 UTC,"I've been developing on a 15 MBPr Retina for years now and it's the best value for performance in my opinion. It's definitely dependent on your type of development though. In my instance I was running multiple VM's so having a large SSD (> 512GB) was a necessity along with the 16GB of RAM and i7 quad core.   If you are doing web development (ie NodeJS or rails) with vagrant or docker I think you might be fine with a smaller Macbook like the Air. If you are doing something that takes up a lot of memory and processing power, the Macbook Pro will handle anything you throw at it, seriously. I would run two VM's with 3 monitors hooked up and it took it like a champ. Keep in mind that was a fully optioned 15 inch MBPro so more than $2500.   Good news, if you went with the Pro, it'll be good for awhile. You shouldn't feel the need to upgrade for at least 3-4 years or more.  Let me know if you have any more questions."

Get the 15 inch if you do anything intense like game development or if you can't hook the machine up to a screen. If you need to be moving about a lot (say, on campus) and can plug the laptop into a screen at work/home, I'd personally go with the 13"".   The 15"" definitely is the best value for the price, but I feel that gap has been closing over the past years for anything except some specialized tasks.  You will also find that for software development, the Mac is a great, well suported platform, with its Unix heritage and a very active, and generally upbeat community.

The screens are much nicer. The colors look better to me and no defects. The monitor without the stand is really lightweight, the ""buttons"" are touch sensitive (which I think is nice).

Because of an issue where the cable provider could only place the modem downstairs (my room/workstation is upstairs) I couldn't have the AirPort on my desk. I couldn't run a cable through the floor because this is a rental so there is really no way around it. That being said the internet is absolute fucking trash with more than one or two devices on it. I have a 30mbps connection and I can get 1mbps with nothing on the wifi but my MacBook Pro. If I connect my iPad or my friend comes over with his MacBook then it slows to a halt. However it may be an issue of wifi antenna in my actual computer because my friend once got 4-5mbps with around 4 or so devices on it. He has a brand new 15"" rMBP; I haven't researched it but wouldn't be completely surprised if they had a better antenna.   Sorry for the rant...

macsetups,3djwqs,ImaCrayon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:04:11 2015 UTC,Signal strength and interference are the 2 things you need to look out for. Having multiple walls between you and the Airport could lead to slower and less reliable connections. You also do not want to place the Airport in places where the signal could run into interference (Ex: Don't stick it next to large metal objects like a fridge or metal drawers).

The Early/Mid 09 boards are the last of the non-unibody MacBooks to have native OS X support beyond 10.7.5.

macsetups,3dffrv,triplewub,2,Thu Jul 16 12:54:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ElementaryOS is really beautiful, it's basically a OS X skin placed on Ubuntu with some additional features, it's very nice!  The project is costing me about $70. I found all the parts I needed on eBay. The seller was nice enough to include an extra 09 base for me to put all the parts into. The bases are slightly different in terms of screw holes. If you don't get a new base, you would need to remove some screw holes out of the old board. You also can only do it on Late 07s and up. The Pre-late 07 MacBooks have different wiring for just about everything and you would have to swap out cables in order to get it to connect to the board, which will usually make the expense more than it's worth.  I definitely recommend getting an actual Mac. I have 14! They mostly consist of older ones, but I have two Intel ones, 11 PowerPC ones (7 are G-era), and one 68k Mac. I'm basically a collector, but each on them has a specific use to me. Some I do keep in storage, but most I have out. I may not be using them daily, but when I need them, I just turn them on and do what I need to on them.   I'd recommend getting an older MacBook/MacBook Pro. Most of the pros with I believe the exception of the first and second gens are all still supported through OS X 10.10/10.11. Natively, MacBooks from Late-08 and up are supported in 10.10/10.11. And I think all MacBook Airs are supported through 10.10/10.11, but don't hold me to that. You can get old ones pretty cheap. I got this MacBook for trading my iPhone 5 to the seller, but it would have cost me 150."
macsetups,3dffrv,triplewub,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:10:35 2015 UTC,"ElementaryOS does look pretty great. I'm just a fan of Debian in general, and primarily use Linux.  I was thinking of getting a MacBook from sometime in 2010, as the price is more realistic, and it would continue to be relevant in terms of  OS X for longer than an older one. I may still look further into this project though, so long as the cost can be kept to a minimum.  I wonder if I could trade my iPhone 4...... I'm kinda doubting it, since it lost support a good while ago.  All Macs from 2008 on should be good to go with 10.10/10.11, as they're all Intel-based. Not to mention the fact that Apple doesn't really give actual system requirements, and instead give you the years of the models that will actually support the upcoming versions of the OS."
macsetups,3dffrv,TootinOnAFlizoot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:58:11 2015 UTC,"The issues with Mid 08 and below is that the shitty GMA isn't powerful enough to run all the graphics and effects in later OSes. I was watching a YouTube video in 720p60, and within a few seconds the fans were on full blast. On my MacBook Pro, with Intel HD something or other, it would be fine. The GMAs are in my opinion the worst GPUs, ever. They are too underpowered to smoothly run anything newer than ML. I could probably push it with ML, but Apple restricts it on Lion. There are hacks for it so if I really wanted to, I could put Yosemite/El Cap on it.  Anyway, regarding the iPhone 4, you likely wouldn't get much for it. If it's mint condition, you may get a little something.  2010 MacBooks/Pros are very nice and should last you a pretty long time. If you have a little extra money, I fully recommend a late 2011 13in MacBook Pro. I have one, and I absolutely love it. I know a lot of people who have them as well and they all love them. You can run 10.6-10.11 and beyond. It's the fastest computer I own, and it's about to be 5 years old. Full recommendation for that one.  BTW, as someone who knows alot about PowerPC Macs, the last PowerPC Mac was made in 2005, and the Intel macs were launched in 2006. PowerPC macs were supported through Leopard, which is when the 08 laptops were out. Lion was out in 2011, so both the last PowerPCs and the 08s were supported for 3 years. So regardless of them being Intel, they still were unsupported because of how much the technology evolved over the 3 years. (Alright, I have no clue where I was going with that...)"

Mercedes don't do a budget model at about £17,000 even though it would probably sell reasonably well and this is because they don't want to do anything to disassociate their name from high-quality, high-spec vehicles."
macsetups,3di13i,PandaSymposium,0,Thu Jul 16 14:29:19 2015 UTC,"That's why I put budget in quotes. It's just because it would be less expensive, not because it would be of poor construction.

macsetups,3di13i,worthtwoshots,3,Thu Jul 16 20:43:05 2015 UTC,"That's fair, but even if it was equally well built people might associate it with a lower price point. It's no secret that apple has big brand appeal.    Out of curiosity, who do you purchase your computers from?

macsetups,3di13i,flyingp0tatoes,2,Thu Jul 16 20:22:15 2015 UTC,"Well like I said it isn't so much about the power of the laptop or computer its for the ""user"" so the new Macbook would target someone who travels frequently and needs email and/or other lighter programs that won't work on a tablet or can't, like adobe creative suite stuff and other light editing programs. I'd guess at least.  I used windows for all my life until college and then got a MBA and it had a SSD and some other stuff windows computers didn't usually have and is still super fast because of the SSD so now I would rather buy a mac then a windows computer kind of thing.

macsetups,3cuo93,valnour,11,Fri Jul 10 23:01:42 2015 UTC,and me why you abandoned multiple screens and a Macbook with actual ports.
macsetups,3cuo93,Muchoz,13,Fri Jul 10 23:14:25 2015 UTC,"I get this question a lot and I'll try to explain it the best I can. I'll warn you I get lost and I babble when I write so this may not make sense by the end of it.   I took up Minimalism, but not in an annoying hipster sense. I really needed it. I have a lot of stress and anxiety. Just naturally, nothing causes it really, I am just an anxious person, but I am on a functioning level with my anxiety. In my past, I tried to crowd this stress and anxiety with things. It's the only thing that made me feel better. Buying things, getting packages in the mail, and having the best of the best in everything. This turned into mild hoarding in a sense, which I get from my father (you should see his office and garage, straight up, damn near clinical, hoarder) I had things upon things, so many tech toys, shit I didn't need and one day I realized it wasn't making me feel better, it was just stressing me out more and costing me tons of money.   I decided to live a more minimal lifestyle. I started by getting rid of everything! Seriously. I started from scratch. I cleaned out all my belongings. I didn't need my top of the line gaming pc (hadn't gamed in a year), I didn't need a 15 inch macbook pro (I browsed the internet, used word and occasionally photoshopped for fun), I didn't need every tech gadget under the sun like I had, really you name it, I had it.  So I ditched the gaming PC with multiple monitors (Sometimes I miss it but 27 inches is plenty real estate for me), ditched my big ass laptop that I hated carrying, got rid of my ipad and basically every item and tech shit I owned and it felt amazing! I have very few belongings, I am living as minimal as possible, but I do still have the urge, and allow myself, to have awesome tech shit! And with all the money I made selling the crazy amount of expensive shit I had, I could afford it :) (In a sense, I'm still in college collecting debt)  I needed some ""power"" and I do my best work sitting at a desk, so I got the 5K iMac to replace my gaming PC (not a necessity, but again, I still allow my urge of having awesome shit take over when it comes to Apple), To replace my iPad and 15 inch rMBP, I got the Macbook. I find it is a great medium between the two. Also, I have found that I have no need for ports, especially living minimal. And then I have my iPhone, which is obviously a necessity, to me anyway. And that's it. That is all the tech I own now and I couldn't be more pleased (oh besides Apple batteries, I need those). Basically everything you see in the picture is everything I own along with clothes, shoes, backpack, and a car and obviously toiletries and other crucial things. I also own a few plants, which are also great therapy for stress and anxiety. I am lucky to not have to worry about kitchen supplies and beds and all that jazz yet because I am in college, but I have every intention of living minimal when graduation comes. For right now, I own very few items, just the necessities and it feels great!   A minimalistic lifestyle has removed a lot of the stress and anxiety I had and allowed me to cope in much better ways. It has also helped me become a better budgeter and has given me freedom financially and generally. I highly recommend the lifestyle to anyone.   So there it is, that got really long and really unnecessary, but that's my answer!  EDIT: TL;DR: Anxiety > Hoarding > Minimalism > Macbook"

macsetups,3cjmak,irvingswiftj,2,Wed Jul 8 12:39:39 2015 UTC,"I have one at work, and it is pretty good! 4k looks great but it has a couple of annoying aspects.    One is how unstable it is.  Any bump to the desk or hard typing will make the monitor wobble.  It's not like it will fall over or anything, but it is noticeable and kind of annoying.  The other bad feature is the lack of adjustment you can make to the angle and height.  The stand is just there, no possible movement.    I ended up buying the ASUS PB278Q  http://amzn.com/B009C3M7H0 for my home, and I totally prefer it (but it is only 2560x1440).  The IPS display is amazing, and it does not have any of the negatives that the Samsung display has.  Asus makes a 4k equivalent of the same monitor that I believe is the same exact screen as the Samsung U28D590D, but with the better mount and stand (http://amzn.com/B00KJGY3TO). Hope this helps!"

Not that it will fall over but I didn't even dare to change screen settings via the joystick without holding the screen with my other hand. If you need 4k at 60 fps you need to use the display port and last time I tried it on my MacBook retina 2014 (13 inch model) it didn't support 60 fps via Mini DisplayPort. The viewing angles are pretty good in my opinion. Only ever have issues if I'm sitting under my desk trying to mess with cables , then the screen looks bad. But aside from that never had any issues. I personally got a new mounting system from gladiator joe and my Samsung is now on a VESA mount. I can take a picture for you if you'd like. The adapter isn't pricey but the shipping actually is. But all in all I bought the screen a year ago on a gamble and haven't regretted it at any point.

The Pi outputs sound through a Fiio Olympus 2 DAC, which outputs to a set of Bose Companion II speakers. I know Bose is generally frowned upon, but they were a gift and I enjoy them. At some point I'll upgrade to something better(been eyeing the AudioEngine A5+ for awhile...)   My Marshall monitor headphones are hanging from an interesting Ikea lamp I picked up a year or two ago. I use the cans when my family is home, since my mother is not altogether fond of loud music).   Bottom right of the desk is my wallet, pocket notebook, a tape measure, and some snips.

It is 1440p 16:9, which is better for most media consumtion and I think 16:9 is preferred by Dota 2. If office stuff is more important for you, you should maybe go for the U2415 since its 1200p 16:10 and it's less demanding on your graphics when gaming.  It also has a build in USB-hub, much like the cinema display, but I wasn't able to try it yet."

The only downside is that unless you have thunderbolt displays, you still need to purchase a mini-displayport to DVI / HDMI adapter, and then an HDMI to DVI adapter / cable if you want to use both display outputs, as the connection to the Mac eats up one of the thunderbolt ports on it. If you had multiple thunderbolt displays, you could just daisy-chain them. Otherwise, it has your gigabit LAN and USB 3.0 ports."

Took a handheld good old fashioned coping saw and carved out the shape from an old piece of salvaged wood. Drilled and hand-chipped the space for the charging puck. Added a rear-opening as well so I can pop the puck back out of the charging stand if I ever decide to travel/need to bring my charger with me without a hunk of wood.   Shaped it up with a rattail file and some 350 and 150 grit sandpaper, and glued a piece of cork board to the face to give it a softer edge to bang against when I toss the watch on there. Finally carved a little channel for the cable underneath and fed it through. Gave the whole thing a bit of a whitewash (hard to see with the colors in the images, but the stand has a hint of gray/white in it when it's in proper light as seen here: http://i.imgur.com/Pzk5lhL.jpg)  Here's some other shots:  Front...

And of course, at the center of it all, a copy of Gray's Anatomy to do three very important things:   1: To remind me of where I've been.  2: To remind me of where I'm going.  3: To hold my monitor at a height more comfortable for my eyeballs ;)."

macsetups,3ahuxg,seditiousseals,3,Sun Jun 21 02:57:49 2015 UTC,Why would you torture yourself with that mouse? I feel like Steve Jobs did some kind of ritual that would make Apple wildly successful but prevent them from ever making a good mouse. I think the hockey puck mouse is proof enough.
macsetups,3ahuxg,orko57,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:28:05 2015 UTC,"Like I said to /u/rapidsalad I've been using the wired one for ages. I like it because it has 2d scrolling, 2 clicks and is slightly more ergonomic than the magic mouse.  Plus is fits in nicely with the rest of my stuff and I've found the tracking on non-apple mice to be really odd once you're used to apple ones, although that's probably a driver issue."
macsetups,3ahuxg,macnerd93,3,Sun Jun 21 01:43:27 2015 UTC,"The tracking issue is because of the way apple handles mouse acceleration with third party mice. Basically, Apple wants you to use their peripherals by making other peripherals not work as well through software. If you want a non-shitty mouse that does all the things you suggest, the Logitech MX Master is something of an industry standard."
macsetups,3ahuxg,icebourg,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:58:00 2015 UTC,I've heard people recommend those before. I'm not a fan of the 'analogue' look/ feel to them - the industrial wheels and side texture just aren't my thing.  I do have a non shitty mouse that does what I want.

Games that I know I would enjoy, from FPS, to RPGs, but that never have the time to play...  If I bought a $500 console, plus $100s more in accessories and licenses for games, I'd be wasting my money. I play at most 90 minutes per week. I don't have time to play more.  So, instead, using my existing MBP to play a game or two, such as the FIFA franchise, of which I am a hardcore fan, is more reasonable, cost effective, and, hey, it works.

The drawers are originally bought for my daughter and were pink and purple till I painted them and the cupboards with blackboard paint. They were a set with the desk from Argos but that was quite a few years ago. I'd like to replace the desk as it's looking quite worn.

Some users only have PPC macs to use at home, and that's it. Sure, they may be limited and slower than today's systems, but if you do tasks that it was designed for or used software from the same era, it does a pretty Damn good job. I, for one, own 12 macs. Of those 12, 1 is Intel, 10 are PowerPC (Pre-Gx and Gx), and one is 68k, which is my 512ke. Each of them serves a purpose or does some specific task."

This was on sale via Amazon and while I wanted the 27"" Dell 4K display, this was my entry to the resolution because to be honest, I'd work all day on my MBP in highest resolution (2880x1800) and then switch to a normal Dell display (even an ultraSharp / IPS) and it would look fuzzy. so I wanted crisp.  The Dell 24"" is at @ 3840x2160. The Macbook Pro is the late 2013, maxed out Core i7 2.6Ghz with GeForce 750M 2GB VRAM.  I've never had UI stutter before on any of my Macs even with 30"" Dell LCD displays using HDMI, MiniDVI, etc.   However, with this thing, activating Expose, iTunes visualizer. Even the Flurries screensaver stutters pretty severely with minimal apps open.  The GPU is always on the NVIDIA and not the Intel one but processor usage and memory usage maxes out pretty fast even when I switch desktops with my trackpad (expose / spaces).   So anyone thinking of going 4K, I'd say today's MBP w/ Discreet graphics can probably handle it fine but this one chokes a bit."

I guess I said Skylake as more of a blanket statement but 18 months from now should lead to a few nice improvements. I still hope for a case redesign but hopefully not at the expense of the great keyboard on today's MBP or battery life (which seems to be the trend lately)

macsetups,37pst0,TheMiamiWhale,1 point,Fri May 29 19:23:56 2015 UTC,"How does the image quality compare to your rMBP? If I recall correctly the pixel density is pretty close right? Out of curiosity, why are you interested in the 27""? Aren't they the same resolution?"
macsetups,37pst0,TheMiamiWhale,1 point,Fri May 29 13:44:05 2015 UTC,"Because 4K resolution is so high that at a certain screen size, the benefits of the pixel density at a certain point become moot. Like an iPhone 6 getting twice the resolution. You already can't see the pixels, why would you make them smaller?  That's how it was explained to me. Truthfully, I disagree with that statement but 27"" would be what I'm used to as my iMac @ home is 27"" and my last computer monitor was a 30"" Dell LCD (pretty old but still worked).  How it compares to MBP....it's matte, not glossy, the 24"" 4K looks more crisp and I prefer it to the MBP...not a scientific response, just how I feel. Once Skylake MBP + Thunderbolt 3 comes out, I'll upgrade the MBP and, if the prices go down, a 5K Dell Monitor."

macsetups,37pst0,Coldmode,1 point,Fri May 29 14:28:14 2015 UTC,"There are people way smarter than me about display resolutions but the way I heard is that OS X has HiDPI which basically doubles the size of screen elements / UI bits on retina displays. So like things are going to look crisp and beautiful but not unreadable because they're so tiny, you just can't see them.  Things are slightly smaller than my 27"" iMac (non-retina) and way less blurry but I don't feel like it's a hugely high-resolution screen the way some of the Windows computers feel when you go max-res. Somehow apple makes the screen feel comfortable and readable while still fitting a lot on the screen.  wish someone could post a link explaining how Apple handles super high-res screens without making me squint to read menu items."
macsetups,37pst0,acselro,2,Fri May 29 14:53:38 2015 UTC,"My understanding has always been that Apple places restrictions to the scale factors applied to elements that are displayed on screen. For high pixel density screens (retina) the default is to double the number of pixels in an element's width and height, thereby quadrupling the total pixels used to display the element. When you want to get ""more"" screen real estate, you decrease that scale factor from 2 in each dimension down to something like 1.5 or 1.25. My guess is that Windows allows the user to set that factor to 1.0, which results in super small elements, while Apple puts the min at 1.25 or something.  When you write software for OS X or iOS you set element dimensions using ""points"", where points are composed of a group of pixels. That way your software works on a super high pixel density screen (like the iPhone 6) as well as a lower pixel density screen (iPhone 4) without needing to write separate code."
macsetups,37pst0,efxhoy,1 point,Fri May 29 15:06:21 2015 UTC,"Very smart and thanks! Makes sense totally. I've used high res Windows screens and the start menu is thinner than a pencil and very difficult to click quickly.

I'm a full-time-author, and I was getting sick of writing in the dark with a bright retina iMac blasting me in the face. Since the window placement in my office is sub-optimal, I decided to try brightening up the space a little ""differently"".  My solution? A set of Ikea Dioders. http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50192365/  20$ online for a set with 4 strips. It comes with everything you need to mount them, and a nifty little color wheel. Slap four stickies on them, stick them to the back of your monitor, and you're done. The color wheel can be adjusted to match pretty much any color you can imagine. Since I had a glass desk, I bought a second kit and used it to illuminate the space beneath my keyboard (a single kit has extra outlets so you can string more than 4 light bars off it - so everything works off a single color wheel).   The cool thing is I can set the lighting to match my mood, and type nice and happy. Green feels great, and the teals and blues are deep and comforting. Red feels downright sinister. Yellow is chipper. White is for when I'm feeling boring.  Anyway, for 20 bucks, I can't knock it one bit.  The whole setup:  5k 27"" Retina iMac - if you're wondering if it's worth the price premium over a regular iMac, or over simply running a 4k 27"" display off the macbook (since the new 2015 retina MBP can properly run a 60hz 4k panel), I have four words for you: Hell yes it is. If your eyes demand absolutely crystal clear text and visuals with zero perceptible pixels, you either need a 5k display, or you need a 24"" 4k. Unfortunately, 27"" 4k monitors aren't quite high enough in pixel density and you will see little annoying jaggies on text. The 5k Retina iMac? Not a pixel in sight. Absolute bliss.  2015 13"" Macbook Pro - for when I'm writing on-the-go.  Poker II mechanical keyboard with a set of MX clears on it for serious work, and a bluetooth apple keyboard for general use.  Logitech MX dark field mouse - It works flawlessly on a glass desk which keeps me from requiring a mouse pad. And yes, I own a magic mouse, and I don't use it. The Apple Magic Mouse is about as ergonomic as a porcupine.  Magic Trackpad - It has become my primary input tool because it's so fantastic.  Custom-modded Galaxy Nexus - I had an old spare phone laying around since I use an iPhone 6+ these days. I modded a wireless charging circuit and carefully wired it into the Nexus's charging pogo pins, and the whole thing is magnetically strapped to an old palm pre inductive charging puck. The phone itself is always displaying my total book royalty earnings for the day (It updates automatically every two minutes, resets at midnight, and has been running screen-on continuously for months without complaint).  Monitor stand is a copy of Gray's Anatomy - Why? Because it's the right size and it put the monitor at exactly the right height, I like the way it looks, and it serves as a reminder of the career I'll have to go back to if I don't write my ass off. It's motivational.  Not-pictured: A vertical-standing 24"" dell ultrasharp - It's off to the left hand side and I occasionally use it for dual-monitor plot lining and editing. Off to the right is a Blue Snowball microphone to my right that I occasionally use with dragon dictation.  Put it all together, and you've got once nice and comfortable creative writing space."

macsetups,36u7ke,ExNihil,1 point,Mon May 25 08:26:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  No, none of the above. You'll likely want a bengal - completely domesticated.   The one in the photo I just posted: he showers nearly every single day, often twice a day (once in the morning with the gf, once at night when I go in). He has to drink and be near running water several times throughout the day or he goes nuts. The bathroom is his favorite place to stay - he goes in and purrs up a storm even if he's not going in the water. This is also the source of our main complaint with him - he howls in the morning if we aren't up early enough to let him into the bathroom and won't stop until we get up... working on fixing that.

macsetups,367d50,YodaLoL,2,Sat May 16 22:03:43 2015 UTC,I believe it's an Ikea Jerker desk after searching; unfortunately seems to be discontinued. I bought the desk and chair off Craigslist for $50 a while back

macsetups,367d50,NCatfish,1 point,Sat May 16 22:11:53 2015 UTC,I added it myself. It is just an Ikea shelf mounted to some kitchen cabinet legs. Super easy! Mainly did it to raise my speakers to ear level as my monitors are on a dual monitor mount already anyway
macsetups,367d50,flyingp0tatoes,1 point,Sat May 16 22:59:18 2015 UTC,It's the EKBY shelf woth the Capita legs. You should go for the lower ones sonce the ones OP's using will make your neck hurt (I had the same exact setup)

macsetups,366m91,McFlyin11,2,Sat May 16 17:40:37 2015 UTC,"Its pretty much that simple. Before you do though, check what sata controller your computer has under system information. There were some issues with some older macbook pros that had nvidia sata controllers that were not 100% compatible with sata 3 ssd's. From what i remember, if your computer has a thunderbolt port you should be fine, but check anyway.   If it is compatible then i suggest creating a usb boot drive of whatever os you want to install. Then you can just remove the old drive, insert the new, and and boot off of the usb and install the os onto your hard drive. I think you might have to format the drive, depending if you bought a mac compatible drive or not, but that isn't an issue and can be done before installing the os."
macsetups,366m91,nathanemke,2,Sat May 16 18:01:24 2015 UTC,I just checked and my MB does indeed have the Nvidia controller. Is this a huge issue? More specifically it's the Nvidia MCP79 AHCI
macsetups,366m91,nathanemke,2,Sat May 16 19:56:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry to say but it is a pretty big deal, its not that it doesn't work, its just very inconsistent. When I upgraded my macbook pro to an ssd, I would get fast transfer speeds, bootup times, and a huge increase in general performance, but my computer was completely unusable at random times. One moment it would be running fine, and then you'd do something simple like try to close a program, or open a photo, it would randomly give me a spinning wheel of death for a few minutes. Then it would be fine for a while and then back to more spinning wheels of death. But then I would go weeks, sometimes months without experiencing any issues at all. Very strange.  Do some searching online for the issue, I think there were a couple of ssd manufactures that released some firmware updates specifically for that problem, but Apple, and many drive manufacturers never responded directly to the issue.   How much ram do you have installed now? Is the macbook your only computer?   I spent hours upon hours researching this, and trying to figure out how to fix it, so if you need any help I don't mind answering any questions that you might have."
macsetups,366m91,nathanemke,2,Sat May 16 20:30:49 2015 UTC,"I see. Yeah it's my only computer. I did buy two 4gb ram to replace the factory memory. Both the SSD and Ram are from Crucial and according to their website both products are compatible with my model MB, although I can understand ""compatible"" might not mean ""100% compatible"". If it helps, the SSD is the MX100 version.   They are supposed to arrive between the 21st and 23rd so I'm trying to prepare myself for the process and I will certainly use you as resource, much thanks!"

My plan is to clone everything from my stock drive and switch the stock 160GB HDD out for the SSD and also switch the optical drive out for the 1TB HDD.  Now here's the difficult part (for me at least): I want to use the SSD mainly for the OS and necessary boot files and all apps, as I am looking for a speed increase. I want to use the HDD to hold all my other files and documents, music, etc.  How should I go about using the cloning kit to get the files I want on their respective drives, and how do I make sure files from the HDD are able to be opened on apps from the SSD (e.g. using iTunes on the SSD to play my library that's located on the HDD)?  Sorry for the wall of text, I am still learning about computers and I am looking to use my MBP for university in the upcoming year."

I like the Ergotron simply because the arm is fully articulating and rotational.  It's nice being able to move the monitors around and rotate them if I'm dealing with code and I want the portrait view.   I hate the idea of having to constantly loosen the clamps and then readjust with the less expensive mounts.

macsetups,34ny6k,jatorres,1 point,Sun May 3 08:32:52 2015 UTC,"That was a bit of my concern as well when buying it. First thing I did was install League, and it runs pretty smoothly on medium settings (55-61FPS). Occasionally my frame rate drops when I die or get dragon buff, but I suspect that's more of a client issue. I also installed WoW. I had to play around with the settings quite a bit, but when I run it on low(shadows off, effects very low) I get a solid 60FPS. Not totally ideal, but it works. While playing either of these, I am able to browse Safari, ect. Not much of an issue there. But if you're doing a lot, it can heat up quite a bit.  In any case, if your main concern is gaming, I would definitely spring for one of the higher end iMacs as the discrete graphics card would probably perform much better than integrated (though I'm sure the mid tier 21.5 inch with iris pro graphics would offer a bit of a boost over mine too).

They come with foam pads to sit on to take the repercussion (can't think of the word, I'm a little tipsy) out of the housing the speakers are in - that really crispness the sound and makes movies great if you are having a loaner night and watching a movie on your computer.. You will feel like you are there - it's cool; epic for some GoT if your into it. And, the speakers are made of actual wood. Adds some weight to them but its made with professional quality materials. I did a lot of research on them and the competitors before I bought them. I really didn't want the plastic casing crap. Mackie is a very good brand.

macsetups,33gqlg,Ida_auken,5,Wed Apr 22 15:47:08 2015 UTC,"Your computer already has a DAC built into it, the benefits of using an external DAC are simply that the circuitry tends to be better, the outputs and inputs are better, the pre-amps are better, they don't suffer the same noise floor problems, your sound quality will most likely improve.  If you're using standard headphones and a regular set of hifi speakers, they won't really be worth it but if you have a good pair headphones, a set of active monitors etc. you'll start to hear the weakest links in your chain a lot more clearly and the DAC is the beginning of that chain. Your computer's output typically won't be great so getting a good headphone pre-amp, balanced outputs for your monitors etc. is worth its weight.  You don't need to spend a fortune. IMO acoustically treating your room is more important."

Was just about to pull the trigger on a Audioengine D1 DAC, but ended up getting the Schiit Modi 2 DAC and the Schiit SYS Passive Preamp(for volume control). Combined it's about the same price. Mostly went with the Schiit combo because it looks nicer, and the A2+ are already plenty loud for office use, so don't think I need an amp (like the typical Schiit Modi2/Magni2 stack. Also don't think you should even plug an amp into powered speakers). Waiting for it in the mail, so no review atm."

It appears redundant and I haven't heard anything that says it's an improvement at all.  Also the A2+ lack a lot of bass and isn't great on the mids, so it's almost always recommended with the AudioEngine subwoofer. But that pretty much is more expensive than the A2+."

They don't care if you take the damn thing apart, and then completely reassemble it, so long as you don't damage the machine. Even if you void one part of the warranty, the other parts may still be in tact / valid. Just keep in mind that Apple will not make any attempt to provide support for you while you're operating in anything other than OS X.  The representative I spoke to assured me that I would be able to do this no problem, but it would be on me if I killed any hardware by doing this. Not really sure how you'd kill a PC by installing an OS, but whatever.  TL;DR Yup. It's cool if you dual-boot. Just don't fuck the computer up."

macsetups,337o93,lolatlogan,2,Mon Apr 20 08:02:29 2015 UTC,"Hey /r/macsetups I've been looking into building a ""set-up"" / getting a monitor for my 15"" Macbook pro.   I'm currently working off of this guy and was looking at buying this monitor. I will most likely go with a generic mouse and wireless apple keyboard.   I am also in the process of building a stand for the monitor.   My only questions are:   What kinda of cables will I need to connect the two? Do you recommend another monitor for my situation? Macbook pro stand or no? I use my laptop everyday for school so I think moving back and forth would be annoying.    I think that's everything. Any advice would be appreciated!"
macsetups,337o93,aronk,2,Mon Apr 20 20:30:51 2015 UTC,"I've had that monitor, and I absolutely hated it. The problem is that the resolution is only 1080p, and on something that's 27 inches, everything looks really pixellated and large. Especially when you go from your retina macbook pro screen to looking at the monitor. It'll be an eye sore. I would HIGHLY suggest getting a 1440p (resolution of 2560 x 1440) monitor for any monitor over 23 inches.   For connections, depending on what monitor you choose to get, it'll likely have an HDMI port, so you can connected directly from the HDMI port on your macbook to the monitor. A laptop stand is useful if you plan on utilizing the macbook screen when you have it plugged in to the monitor, so that you can have it be lifted closer to the same height of the monitor. That way, it's not jarring when moving the mouse back and forth between monitor and the laptop screen. But in general, it's really a personal preference.   TL;DR: That monitor blows, get a 1440p monitor if you want 27 inches, otherwise downsize to 23-24 inches for 1080p."
macsetups,337o93,lolatlogan,2,Mon Apr 20 21:18:59 2015 UTC,"My pro is a 2010, so not retina. Any 24"" monitors or even 27"" you recommend specifically? I don't plan on gaming like most, just work and movies. Thanks for the help! I also don't want to invest a shit ton for something that will be outdated in 2-3 years."
macsetups,337o93,aronk,2,Mon Apr 20 21:55:33 2015 UTC,"Ah I see. In that case, you'll need a DisplayPort to HDMI converter cable, so something like this: http://www.amazon.com/PNY--DM-HD-W01-Mini-DisplayPort-Adapter/dp/B007B6YPAM/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1429567214&sr=1-2&keywords=mini+displayport+to+hdmi  For 27"" monitors, you'd want 1440p, but that's still going to cost you a pretty penny even though 4K is already in the market. There's an Acer 27"" monitor at 1440p here: http://www.amazon.com/Acer-K272HUL-bmiidp-27-inch-Widescreen/dp/B00JB6HCIC/ref=sr_1_7?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1429567373&sr=1-7&keywords=computer+monitor+2560x1440.   I don't have personal experience with it, but it's got decent reviews. However, you're probably looking at around $450-550 for a nice 1440p 27"" monitor.   If you want to scale down to 24"" or 23"", at 1080p, you could finds boat-loads of highly rated monitors that are well within your budget.   Keep in mind that buying a monitor right now is strange, so in regards to things being outdated in 2-3 years, that's likely going to happen regardless of what you buy. 1440p hasn't fallen heavily in price due to 4K monitors just yet, since 4K isn't too mainstream at the moment, and it still considered very new tech. But already, players like Dell and LG are coming out with (relatively) affordable 4K  monitors, so inevitably price drops will happen to the 1440p monitors. It's up to you whether you want to wait and see, or just jump in now.  In my personal opinion, a 24"" 1080p monitor would work just fine for your use cases right now. I think it'll be better for you to save that extra cash, and look in to perhaps updated your laptop in the future since that'll be a much bigger jump up compared to the monitor."
macsetups,337o93,lolatlogan,2,Mon Apr 20 22:09:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the tips. I guess I'm just now wandering for a monitor now. How about this 24"" version of what I had previously listed?"
macsetups,337o93,aronk,1 point,Tue Apr 21 05:18:04 2015 UTC,"That should be fine. Dell makes really good monitors. You might be able to find better pricing if you deal shop a bit, since 1080p monitors are always going on sale now-a-days."
macsetups,337o93,lolatlogan,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:28:28 2015 UTC,"Ahh okay. I was leaning towards the monitor now because I liked the idea of the built in speakers. I've noticed a handful of people buy speakers separate, is there any specific reason for this?"
macsetups,337o93,aronk,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:19:34 2015 UTC,"Yes. Usually integrated speakers are awful, and you won't really good any worthwhile sound. It's alright in a pinch, but for movies, music, etc., you'll want atleast a basic set of dedicated speakers. You don't have to spend crazy money for a 2.1 setup if you don't want to, but anything will be better than the integrated speakers."
macsetups,337o93,lolatlogan,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:13:11 2015 UTC,Ahh thanks for that! I'll opt to find a monitor without speakers now and invest in a set. Any you recommend? Ha? I mean just something to get in the right direction.
macsetups,337o93,aronk,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:20:56 2015 UTC,"That can vary in a really huge way depending on your budget. You can rock a basic set of okay computer speakers for around $30, or get some seriously awesome speakers for around $400-500. Both will be better than the integrated monitor speakers.   For something cheap that's good at its price point, you can look at these:  http://www.amazon.com/Cyber-Acoustics-Subwoofer-Frustration-CA-3602FFP/dp/B00BXF5HQ8/ref=sr_1_16?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1429671374&sr=1-16&keywords=creative+speakers  If you're talking serious audio, AudioEngine A5+ are awesome: http://www.amazon.com/Audioengine-Powered-Book-Shelf-Speakers/dp/B005OA3BSY/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1429671440&sr=1-1&keywords=a5%2B."
macsetups,337o93,lolatlogan,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:57:43 2015 UTC,"Late question, but why would you recommend I buy this instead of this? Doesn't the latter port directly into the monitor while the one you recommended doesn't? I guess it depends on if the cables are included with the monitor, right?"
macsetups,337o93,aronk,1 point,Sat May 2 04:45:38 2015 UTC,"It's a matter of preference. I like having the adapter since most people have HDMI cables and you can usually find them all over the place even within your own household. If you have to move your laptop around to connect to different displays for whatever reason, it's easier just to this the little adapter with you in your hand or in a bag instead of an entire cable. Also, if something is wrong with an HDMI cable, just replace it with another one from wherever since you got an adapter. If you get the all-in-one, you'll have to order an entire other cable since you're probably not going to have multiple HDMI to mini display port cables laying around."

macsetups,32y4pv,iRedditWhilePooping,2,Fri Apr 17 23:37:56 2015 UTC,How do you find the task of keeping everything in sync? Had a Mac mini and MBP for a few months and nearly went insane trying to keep system sustains and files and stuff straight in my head. Much rather plug into external monitor and all my files and settings are the same every time
macsetups,32y4pv,machei,4,Sat Apr 18 02:24:47 2015 UTC,"Luckily Apple's ecosystem gets better and better in terms of syncing setting, etc.  It helps when you live in the cloud as I do. I store very little files on my actual computer. Flickr's free 1TB houses all of my photos, Dropbox houses all of my files, and I stream all of the movies and TV shows I watch now. So everything I need is available on all devices, in the same spot (just as long as you organize your dropbox folder well enough)"
macsetups,32y4pv,machei,1 point,Sat Apr 18 05:32:16 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I do a lot of web and app development so often it can be a real pain to keep that many files in Dropbox.

macsetups,32y4pv,GoldenBough,2,Sat Apr 18 15:32:48 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I hope to do. I have a 5K iMac and want the MacBook for mobile computing. I keep getting worried though with all the reviews saying its underpowered. I was waiting to read some real world examples. It's nice to read that you are satisfied with this setup!
macsetups,32y4pv,GoldenBough,4,Fri Apr 17 23:33:00 2015 UTC,"Once you get in the mindset of what the machine is for, it's actually pretty capable. It's actually pretty capable in general. It turbo boosts to 2+ Ghz, so it's not like it can't keep up with tasks, but you have to keep the tasks in mind. What is this machine for? Web Browsing and content consumption (Chrome, YouTube, Netflix, Hulu). Word Processing (Email, Notes, Evernote, etc) That narrows down to what you'll really use this laptop for. You wont be editing videos obviously, not even pictures (although Im sure it can handle light photo editing)  Here's something to also note. My roommates chromebook (The nice Toshiba one even). When you try to play a full HD 1080p YouTube video on it, it studders and stalls and it awful to watch. On the macbook however, smooth as butter.   When you think about what portable machines are for, like I mentioned above, this laptop is more than capable.   EDIT: Jealous of your 5k iMac btw. I'm on the 1440p one. The 5K was a tad out of my price range, especially since I knew I was getting the macbook!"
macsetups,32y4pv,kandrejevs,2,Sat Apr 18 06:13:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for taking the time to write back with your thoughts! See, that's what I was thinking. Right now, I use my iPad with a Logitech keyboard cover to do all of my remote work, but it doesn't always play nice with full-on OS X apps (although Ulysses has made that a heck of a lot better). What I'd like from the MacBook is mostly to be my portable writing rig. I'd use it much like I use the iPad, except I wouldn't have to diddle with iOS/OSX stuff, and it would have the keyboard and touchpad right there, which is better for me.  My hope was that I could save all the photography stuff for the iMac, and do all the portable stuff with the MacBook, and I think it should be up for that task--but given all the specs peepers telling me the new machine is on par with a four year old Air, it gets me worried.  That said, it seems to tick all the boxes for me. I knew the first time I saw the Retina screen on the iPhone 4, I'd never go back. I'm pretty much to the point where if it doesn't have retina or an SSD, it's a non-starter. I picked up the 5K iMac last year with a 512GB SSD, and the thing is heaven. I've been holding off on the MacBook for two years now, saving away for the day they'd give me the Air with a Retina screen, and I think this is it, underpowered or not. I could wait for the next iteration, but then I'm stuck with the iPad for another year. First world problems, I know, but I typed well over 250,000 words on that thing last year--I think I would benefit from the laptop.  Cheers to you! Your setup looks wonderful. :)  Oh, P.S. I wanted to ask you--some reviews say the machine gets quite hot thanks to the lack of fans. Have you noticed that?"
macsetups,32y4pv,rumbletumjum,3,Sat Apr 18 16:28:42 2015 UTC,"Retina is the best!  It does get warm, however, not as hot as my 15 inch Retina Macbook Pro. That would literally burn my legs, the Macbook, however, just warm to hot, where as the macbook would be warm to scorching hot. lol."

macsetups,32vg0r,es1,1 point,Fri Apr 17 04:04:16 2015 UTC,"I do have some UI lag, I believe this may be down to the fact that, in order to run it in non-pixel-doubled HiDPI, you need to make a 4K scaled resolution first. Mind you it's not like running an actual 4K monitor which in most machines only goes up to 30Hz, scrolling on well optimised apps like basic webpages or iWork works just as fast as before. It becomes more noticeable with things that lag on the built-in retina display anyway, such as mission control."

Otherwise, 1440p is perhaps just a tiny bit too small on a 25"" screen. You could get used to it, but the screen doesn't feel right for opening multiple windows on the same screen (if you know what I mean) and then at the same time if I take a browser make it fill the screen like I normally do, there's a heck of a lot of blank space at the edges. Having a 27"" 1440p screen I think just gives you the right scale for it.   Don't let me put you off though if you think you can get used to it. Fab monitor. Dare I speak it here, but it looks great on a Windows PC too."

I currently use a Logitech K480 with my PC and I do not miss the numpad at all.

As for the number pad, I've never used one. They seem useful if you do a lot of data entry with numbers, but for the most part it's nice to keep my hands as close to the home row as possible.  Also, not sure why having two monitors has anything to do with a keyboard."

The older iMacs use full sized desktop graphics which still rival the current mobile graphics in the new slimmed down iMacs. But doing it is pretty stressful as you have to remove the glass from the front panel and disconnect about 7 cables after undoing about 16 t10 Screws to get behind all the components. I'd say it's worth it though.

I have the 2012 model with the i7.  I put in 16 GB of RAM and a Samsung Evo 256 GB SSD.  I love it!! Normally I get a new computer every 4 years, but this one is going really strong after 3 so it may be 5 or 6 before I replace it.  If the Mac mini keeps going in the direction they're taking it (non-user-upgradable), I'll have to get a different computer :(  How do you feel about the new Mac minis?"
macsetups,31gws2,BarnacleBoi,2,Sun Apr 5 03:57:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, they're very similar! Mine is also the Late 2012 model, but the specs are: 2.5 GHz i5, 4GB, Intel HD Graphics 4000. My parents gave it to me back in 2013 and it's still going strong! I use it for everything from the occasional Steam game to school projects. I hope it will last me until I graduate high school in 2017!   And as for the new Mac Minis, I've tried them at the Apple Store and they seem relatively the same. A few port tweaks and internal changes, but everything else is pretty much equal. Now the Mac Pro, on the other hand, is something I'd invest in."
macsetups,31gws2,BarnacleBoi,2,Sun Apr 5 05:05:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  I decided not to get the fusion drive or SSD when I got the Mac mini, but I put it in later and it made all the difference.  From that point on I decided my main computer should definitely have a user-upgradable storage drive and RAM.  By the way, I highly recommend putting in an SSD.  It will dramatically change the start up speed and the speed at which apps open.  The difference is night and day and it only costs around $100 or so.  So if the Mac mini isn't user-upgradable by 2017 or so, I'll have to go with a Mac Pro (a little over the top for me) or a hackintosh (I really don't want to have to deal with keeping the OS stable) or a Windows computer.  I don't hate Windows computers (I built one that I use as a media machine) but I really prefer OS X as my main OS.

Laptop has safari open almost exclusively to stack overflow (I use safari for browsing and research, because it's fast, and the bookmarks sync to my phone, and iPad. I also use the ""open tabs on other devices"" feature a lot.).  Top monitor has chrome open to localhost:3000 (it's on apidock right now, because my app currently exists as a few lines on a blank screen, not very photogenic). I use chrome for development because the developer tools available smoke every other browser in that regard.  The iPad runs Alfred 2 remote. It's set up with buttons for common terminal tasks like resetting the database, and bookmarks to api resources. It's a very efficient set-up for development as a novice.  I don't keep any communications up like email, or skype, because I don't currently collaborate with anyone, or have any paying clients. This is more of a hobby for me.  The headphones are philips bluetooth, $50, nothing special, but there's no way in hell i'm dropping $300 on Beats. Fuck that.  The plants are a pinterest special. Succulents and a cactus in a jar of dirt. Fancy. The framed image says ""A bicycle is a simple solution to the worlds most complicated problems"".

The vents are located by the hinge, so when the lid is closed the vents shoot all the hot air out without anything in their way.   Nice setup, btw."

I'm ditching my Macbook Pro 15 inch for an iMac and a Macbook. (Seems weird to some people but I am more productive with desktops, and need something super portable and the 15 inch Macbook isn't the happy medium I thought it would be)  Anyway, I'm struggling to figure out of the 5K is worth it. I'm somewhat of a pixel snob, but I don't know if it justifies the money. Base Model is 1440p, which isn't bad, but 5k is obviously going to be much much crisper.   Base 27 inch is going to run me 1699, while the 5k is 3299, but it throws in a fusion drive which would cost me an extra $200 bucks on the base model.

The mobile class GPUs that drive all iMacs simply aren't powerful enough to drive higher end applications.   I'm not saying the 5k IMac isn't a nice machine, because it is. I just don't think it's worth the extra $1500 to buy it. That's literally the cost of the new MacBook you want.  Just my 2 cents.  I currently have the new LG 34UM95 ultrawide that splits duty between my gaming PC and my 13"" rMBP.

macsetups,2z9yb3,Kulimeya,3,Mon Mar 16 22:23:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, but also with this you get a performance hit because of the PCIe speed of Thunderbolt compared to a normal desktop slot. It's in the region of 5-15% for most cases."

macsetups,2z9yb3,STIFSTOF,2,Mon Mar 16 23:21:48 2015 UTC,"It has Thunderbolt 2, and yeah, it mitigates the performance hit by a bit compared to Thunderbolt 1.  When Skylake comes out it will have Thunderbolt 3, where the bit rate will be 2x as much as Thunderbolt 2, which will probably decrease the performance hit to about 3-10%."
macsetups,2z9yb3,STIFSTOF,9,Tue Mar 17 01:01:34 2015 UTC,"My eGPU is a modified Sonnet III-D (£650+) with a GTX 780 Ti (Refurbished, £380). It's powered by a Silverstone 450W PSU (£80) and I replaced the fans with 2x Noctua NF-R8s (£20). You can get a cheaper Akitio Thunder2 enclosure (£200) and it will perform exactly the same as the III-D and it will actually work with an MBP with dedicated graphics and a Maxwell card.  This website is pretty much where you can get all information about eGPUs: http://forum.techinferno.com/diy-e-gpu-projects/  On my last setup posted here I had the same GPU which was too power hungry for the 300W built in PSU of the III-D (that and the stability issues I was having with a cheaper TB2 chassis (Sonnet SEL) were the reasons why I bought it). It had a 620W Seasonic PSU and the whole setup being powered with two power sources was a bit messy for me so I upgraded my 780 Ti to a 980 using EVGA's trade in program.  It didn't work at all with the III-D because of the 750M in my laptop so I used the cheaper SEL that I had and it worked for 3 months until I accidentally damaged the SEL so I had to sell the 980 and go back to a 780 Ti. I also managed to get rid of the 300W built in PSU and have the whole thing powered using a 450W PSU.  TL;DR: Had a 780 Ti in my last setup, upgraded to a 980 but wouldn't work with the III-D, used another Thunderbolt 2 chassis, damaged the chassis, downgraded back to 780 Ti."

macsetups,2z9yb3,_yeahright_,3,Mon Mar 16 23:20:57 2015 UTC,It depends on what you want with your eGPU. The good news is that your MBP has no dedicated graphics which probably means less trouble for you than it did for me.  Some people with an Akitio box took out the circuit board and placed it inside a small computer case while others have managed to keep the GPU inside the original Akitio case (except the PSU which you'll definitely need). Either way using things like powered risers or even some soldering will be required which will void the warranty of the Akitio box.

macsetups,2z9yb3,Tofon,2,Tue Mar 17 16:39:33 2015 UTC,"Nope, you'd have to modify kext files whatever Mac you use to get it up and running. After that, it's almost plug and play; you'll have to switch off your computer if you want to connect/disconnect your GPU.  Assuming you have an NVIDIA card, all you'll have to do is to enable kext dev mode and all that in terminal as well as modify the official NVIDIA Mac driver to install so that you can install it on a computer that isn't a Mac Pro.  And also, you're right, I have the monitor connected directly to the GPU via DisplayPort.

Also, although not officially supported probably because of Intel, Thunderbolt is PCIe based so it is able to run almost anything that interfaces with PCIe, GPUs included, so Macs with Thunderbolt are able to run GPUs. There are pros/cons though depending on which Mac you use with it, but if you like having everything on one computer and having performance when it's sitting on your desk and you don't mind some warranty-voiding tinkering then this may be a viable option!  If you want to try this and you can hold out for a few more months to a year or so wait until Skylake Macs come out with Thunderbolt 3 which decreases the performance hit with these GPUs."

macsetups,2z9yb3,TheMiamiWhale,2,Tue Mar 17 20:27:53 2015 UTC,"Well I'm guessing it's because GPUs not actually supported via Thunderbolt so Apple etc do not actually develop the Firmware/OS support for it.

It may be worth it, just to have a running home server around. Or, like HaynBryn said, you could just trade the thing to someone for a Mac Mini or something.

I'm getting rid of things I don't use/want/need, this includes my gaming PC, which I haven't used in ages.   I still want a desktop, however, so my thoughts were to sell my gaming PC, and get an iMac.   I also have a Macbook Pro Retina (15 inch), I planned to trade this in for something much more portable, like a Macbook.   Thoughts on that setup? iMac 27 inch (probably not 5k, just 1440p version) for performance and a Macbook for ultra portability.  EDITS:  Follow up Question: Do you think if I go with this setup, and have the new Macbook, do I even need my iPad anymore? Since I am trying to simplify my life as much as possible, I'm wondering if the iPad has enough use cases over the Macbook that I would still want to keep it...  Now that I've been thinking about it, I could make the iPad a completely none portable device (since I would have a Macbook) and get one of these, so it would just permanently supplement the iMac.  http://store.apple.com/us/product/HFHU2ZM/A/twelve-south-hoverbar-3-flexible-arm-for-ipad-and-ipad-mini?afid=p238%7CDnsAvUNF-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_52243344970_&cid=aos-US-kwg-pla-btb  What do you all think?"

I can't be on the phone for more than 30seconds before I start pacing around - I think better on my feet. And re. the mat, I think it depends on how plush the pad under the carpet is. If standing on the carpet is therapeutic enough Id say not to bother, but having a mat might better distribute your weight and not wear down your carpet as much."

Right now I am personally a fan of ErgoTron and geekdesk, but I haven't looked around recently.  Do you know your budget, and the dimensions for the desk that you're interested in?

Sound comes out via a 3.5mm output that goes straight to the speakers. It's also versatile tile in terms of video system (supports both NTSC and PAL). NTSC, the North American system, was causing imagine flicker when I plugged in the MacBook Air.

I 've thought it weird before that computer sci. has always been considered to be apart of the ""science community"" and not the ""engineering community"".   I think this is because engineering applies to the study of physical systems, (fluids, magnetics, electrons, materials, physical structures) and comp. sci. students never actually study applied physics of any physical system in the universe. And if you write code that does interface with a physical system then you have an engineer that gives you the governing equations to be coded in... such as for a race car video game (aerodynamics drag, torque plot of engine, vehicle suspension behavior, etc.  Would you say I'm more or less right?  oh.. and nice setup!!"

The speed, the versatility, the battery life, charge time, etc. etc. Just having the guarantee that every time I pull that thing out of my backpack, I am logged in and doing what I need in five seconds flat. The PCI-E SSD is god like.   This is one of my three offices, so I only get to work on the mac mini once or twice a week at most. The mini is what I got first when I only worked at one building - but then we expanded and I had to start traveling. This is when I got the air. Best work purchase ever.   Working with Mac OS when it comes to work has improved my productivity tenfold. I'll never go back to a Windows OS based machine for a primary work computer."

macsetups,2xqm2b,crawlywhat,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:56:38 2015 UTC,How come you've not swapped the windows logo key with the alt key? First thing I did when moving to a mechanical keyboard.  I eventually removed the Windows logo keys with the portal pair keys.

macsetups,2xqm2b,mikelcold,1 point,Tue Mar 3 16:13:52 2015 UTC,"The mac keyboard layout goes Control -> Option -> Command in windows it is Control -> Windows -> Alt. So copy is Command-C but using a mechanical keyboard with windows default settings you would press Win-C for copy. However, if you move between lots of different apple devices, Command being in a different location can lead to things being quiet annoying.  So most mechanical keyboards have a set of jumper switches on the back or bottom. One of these switches changes the Alt and Windows key location. You flip that, then flip the Key Caps, and now you have a closer layout to a regular mac keyboard."
macsetups,2xqm2b,emman1993,1 point,Tue Mar 3 16:19:09 2015 UTC,"See, that is a very valid reason as to why I should have done it, but I guess I just never have felt the need hahaha. Whenever I'm on a mac I kind of already know whether to use my 'mac' hand position or 'windows' hand position...basically just a certain way my fingers move when pressing hotkeys like CMD+Shift+4 or CMD+V and what not.   The other thing really is I never really look down...that Das keyboard has blank caps for the first year and a half I had it....so even if the caps were switched, I would have just been going off of muscle memory anyways.   Thanks for explaining!  But now that you mention it, maybe i'll give it a shot?"
macsetups,2xqm2b,DeepEcho,1 point,Tue Mar 3 16:55:01 2015 UTC,"Hah, when I moved to Mac I wanted to move as far away from Windows as possible, so I picked up the portal keys to wipe the Windows logo from memory, lol  I need to figure out what to do with my caps lock key though, I've disabled mine on the Mac, so I should really find an interesting keycap to replace it with.  The only problem I have with the mechanical keyboards and mac, is nobody has made a back light friendly option and command button set. You can get nice printed keycaps, but none for backlight keyboards.  Interestingly though, after years of mechanical keyboard usage, I'm using the wireless mac keyboard more and more. I think I find myself just faster to type on it and also the quieter key presses is really nice for home where I don't use headphones."
macsetups,2xqm2b,keikun13,2,Tue Mar 3 17:10:34 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha - If i wasn't a PC gamer, I would have abolished Windows from my personal life - but being a Network Admin, having windows machines is a must.   Why did you disable caps lock?  I did love the mac keyboard. The only reason I brought my Das to work was because I spilled coffee all over my wireless keyboard :(. Made me very sad. But since I do a LOT of typing at that office - the mechanical fits very nicely. Also, I feel you on the struggle for backlit mechanicals for macs...   Edit: Even 'mac' editions of keyboard still have three keys left to the spacebar instead of four. They usually just rid of the Function key on the left side."

Its faster than most friends 2013 versions, simply because of their HDs.   The keyboard works well and is comfortable and responsive.

I highly recommend participating in undergraduate research, especially if you plan on going to graduate school.  During my physics research project, my adviser put in a grant to take me to CERN with him and perform some experiments at ISOLDE Hall.  It was at that point that I decided I wanted to study nuclear physics, so when it came time to searching for graduate schools, I narrowed my search field to ones that had such research groups.  I was accepted into a graduate school that does high energy nuclear physics and was picked up the group shortly after.  If you're interested in CERN in general, you may want to explore options in experimental high energy physics (Higgs, supersymmetry, etc...) as well; I do not study that.  TL;DR: Apply to colleges that offer research opportunities that you are interested in and participate in said research.  Lather, rinse, and repeat for graduate school."

I bought this one for college in April 2010 while I was still in highschool (Paid for 100% by me - I bought it as my 18th birthday present to myself). I now use it  solely as my Audio Production computer.  The Second: is an Early 2011 - 2 GHz i7 / 16gb ram / Dual hard drives: (Main HD) 240gb SSD / (2nd HD) 960gb SSD. The company that my mom works for bought this one for her, they were going to switch over to Apple but it never ended up happening so she wasn't using it since everything for her company runs on Windows. My mom let me take the 2011 MBP because I had gotten a job as a personal assistant to a big name house DJ/Producer and I needed to keep my stuff separate from his. It also helped having two computers to multitask during work!  As for the Speakers I love my KRKs. I know they're not anything great but I'm used to the way they sound. Plus the room they are in is totally un treated and probably has horrible acoustics.

macsetups,2w454u,imtotallyahuman,5,Tue Feb 17 01:33:37 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean by slower.

That's debatable. I've found that (at this point) swift isn't as fully ingrained into Xcode like obj-c is. Obviously that's getting better every day and will soon be fine. Additionally modern language features should make development easier, especially if your team is familiar with ruby, js, or functional programming. Basically I really like swift. But obviously it's up to each team to decide what suits them the best."

The retina display kinda goes to waste. Plus, I know Henge Dock claims on their website that there should be no issues with cooling, but I find that hard to believe since the keyboard on the rMBP acts as a vent as well. Personally, I used an mStand for my rMBP. Mostly in clamshell mode connected to an external display, but I still have the option of opening the laptop when I hear the fans kick in to help with cooling, or if I need an additional display.

It feels almost protected from anything else that might happen (I often eat at this desk, so if I spill anything, the heart of this setup, which would be my laptop, would be safe.  Also, I posted my current temp readings to another question just now. I've noticed no change in the heat of my laptop. My fans barely go off. However, keep in mind that I don't use it heavily every day. The CPU and GPU seems to hold up fine :).  I can see the keyboard being used as a vent because the black backing of the laptop is blocked and faces downwards. However, in this situation, the keyboard vent is blocked and the entire backing faces sideways and has plenty of room to breathe. Even the small part of the dock at the bottom that covers the vent has a strip for ventilation."

macsetups,2ud57k,davros_,6,Sun Feb 1 02:25:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I just ruined my first post on reddit ever where I explained the entire setup and then accidentally refreshed the entire page. I can't even...  But it's okay, I have plenty of time so... here we go again.   First off, this setup has been in the making since 2012 and back then it wasn't intended to look like this. At all. It was supposed to be some kind of super fancy dual screen PC setup (which it did at some point in 2013) but it was so messy and cluttered that it needed a second, smaller desk placed perpendicularly on the left side of the main one just so that I could place my cameras, prints, works, etc. Now, fast-forward to 2014 when I got the chance to buy a used Macbook Pro 13"" cheaply which got me hooked even more on Apple products. It was just a matter of time until I got a 27"" iMac for my design/photography purposes.  After weeks of viewing, analyzing and planning, I've finally managed to create the setup which suits me best while having enough space and functionality for future upgrades.  The main white desk is a custom made one inspired by IKEA's MALM desk. It's very sturdy, easy to clean and it gets the job done. On the other hand, it's very heavy and nearly impossible for me to move it on my own because it's made out of two chipboards plastered together. The desk was made back in 2012 and this was the only way I could get it done.  The custom made shelves above are the exact same length as the desk itself and are placed at 30 centimeters distance of each other and about 80 centimeters above the desk. Those too are made out of two chipboards plastered together (18 x 2 milimeteres wide).   Paper holder, pencil holder and the trash can (not visible in the photo) are all IKEA's Dokument series. Honestly, the pencil holders are not so good out of the box as they tend to wobble a lot, but I've managed to fix that. On the other hand, the paper holder is really well made.  Up next, the drawer on the left side is an IKEA Alex 5 which is a must-have. I've retrofitted it with non slip drawer liners and it's even more amazing. It also matches well with my main desk in depth so that I can put it under it, but I opted to have more leg room and a centered iMac instead.  The LED strips are a DIY kit. 2 meters of RGB LEDs, a power supply, connector and a controler with an Apple-like remote. It works very well and the LEDs don't overheat or any stuff like that.  Hidden under the table is the IKEA Signum which cleaned up all the cable mess. It needs more work though, and I plan to solve that in the next few days.  As for the iMac itself, it's a Late 2013 model, 3.2 GHz i5, 16 Gb RAM, 1 TB HDD, GeForce GT 755M. The MacBook Pro is a 13"" Late 2010 model which is going to get replaced soon. Also, the black box behind the iMac is a 4Tb Western Digital MyBook drive.  Edit: Grammar"

We just moved into a new office and I got a brand new network/server room. It's a little small, but it works. (In the old office, there was no dedicated room) I inherited this setup, a Mac Pro as the main file server connected to a Promise array ( but I'm likely replacing that entire rig with a Mac Mini and Lacie 8big disk arrays soon) Have a few other Mac Mini's in the rack for application servers. We're an entirely Mac office, it's sweet!  The network rack has nothing to do with Macs, but I couldn't help but show it off!"

I'm seriously looking into replacing my Thunderbolt monitor with a single ultra-wide (that model specifically), or two 24"" 1200x1900 monitors (DELL U2415) but am really up in the air about it. Any pros & cons appreciated!"
macsetups,2u4164,XKXKKXK,1 point,Mon Feb 2 23:21:13 2015 UTC,"PROS:  It's so wide (which goes without saying).   The resolution is awesome, I don't really miss my retina screen all that much. I bought a 4K Samsung Monitor and the 1080p version of this monitor before I settled on this one. The color on the Samsung wasn't the best, so I returned it and bought the 34UM65, and while I REALLY liked it, the resolution left a lot to be desired (especially coming from a retina screen).  This monitor filled those needs nicely. The resolution is perfect for me and the color was way more accurate than the Samsung (apparently LG calibrates the colors in the factory).  The silver on the base and the back of the monitor matches the MacBook and the chrome around the edges and gives the monitor a nice premium look and feel.   I don't feel any lag, but then again I don't really game on it and those who do have reported small input lag.  Built in speakers are a plus (the Samsung didn't have any), but don't expect to be blown away.  The power save feature is nice, it goes into standby when the laptop goes to sleep.  CONS:  The base is decent, it can wobble if the desk is moved a lot, but it isn't a major issue for me.   There is some light bleed in the corners on mine. It doesn't really bug me, but I know some people are really picky about that.  Once in a rare while there is a flicker on the screen, usually on the bottom half of the screen. I'm not entirely sure what causes it.  SUMMARY:  Even with it's minor (to me) cons, I love the monitor. I love the screen space, the resolution is just right, the colors are pretty accurate, and I love how it matches my Mac.  Let me know if you any questions about anything!"

macsetups,2u3ze9,sebastiaanchia,2,Mon Feb 2 23:24:31 2015 UTC,"Well I haven't had many monitors myself so I don't know if I'm qualified to give pros and cons but a few things I can observe...  The 1440 resolution is very nice in a 25"" form factor, every night when I come home by 24"" 1080 monitor looks a bit pixelated, but it is a gaming monitor..  Brightness is very good and nice viewing angles. There's an anti glare coating that doesn't bother me. It might desaturate the colours a bit but I'll pay that price for almost no noticeable reflections.  There's plenty of inputs on the rear (I think 2 x HDMI, DisplayPort and DPMini both input and output, and around 4 or 5 USB3). I use DisplayPort with the Macbook Pro which was perfect as soon as I connected it up.  One negative that I've noticed is that if I connect my Logitech MX receiver to the built in USB, it doesn't perform that great and the cursor becomes quite jumpy. Not quite sure what that would be as I only have my keyboard and the receiver connected and they're USB3.  If I had the money I would definitely buy two more for a dual monitor setup at home."

I got this monitor because the bezels are very thin (7mm I think). But when I take the computer out, the difference in screen quality is quite noticeable .

macsetups,2tb4mw,yeticabra,3,Fri Jan 23 14:20:21 2015 UTC,Mini is perfect for my needs for just editing/sound design. The 2.3gHZ i7 CPU has plenty of oomph to take care of my needs. Where I need a MacPro is when we are using Audio interfaces to output lots of tracks to a mixing stage. It's more about PCI slots than raw CPU power.

macsetups,2t3gea,cabe83,2,Sun Jan 25 18:46:03 2015 UTC,"How long have you had the Linksys router, and how do you find it in terms of amount of time running without a reboot vs speed/throughput?"
macsetups,2t3gea,cabe83,1 point,Wed Jan 21 08:26:15 2015 UTC,"I asked for this router for christmas, and the wife came through. We live in a tall skinny 2 story townhouse made of concrete, in the middle of a bunch of condo buildings spewing hundreds of wi-fi signals. The office (and modem) is on the top floor at the front of the house and the living room is at the back of the house on the lower floor.  I had a pretty decent dual band router from linksys before this one. In the living room we could only get the 2ghz, and it was still pretty spotty. This meant shoddy Netflix, PSN, and pretty much any other kind of connection besides plain browsing.  With this new one (WRT 1900ac) both the 2ghz and 5ghz bands have full signal in the living room. Netflix, Facetime, PSN (with some easily done port forwarding) now all work flawlessly. I can use AirPlay to mirror the iMac's screen onto the AppleTV in the living room to watch movies stored on the mac. Or hook my laptop up to the TV and play 1080p movies over the network without having to copy them first.  I've never once had to reboot it, unless I'm playing with the settings and it needs to restart to take effect. It's like a whole new world.  I found it kind of useless at using the USB as network storage. My external drives are all Mac formatted, so that could be the problem. They showed up on the network, but I could only get the connection to work once or twice. I went back to sharing the drives right from my iMac, and that works flawlessly (as it did before, now just with farther range and far better speed).  Overall, 9/10. Would recommend."
macsetups,2t3gea,SmallSubBot,1 point,Wed Jan 21 20:24:23 2015 UTC,"That sounds really great! Thank you for taking the time for a full review. I myself will be moving into my first townhouse soon (from a single level house) and the lower level has the cable/modem point in the wall, so I was going to stick the modem + router there and hope it reaches the top.  At the moment I have a Airport Extreme (802.11n) but will be moving to a Asus RT-87U (well that is at least my first choice) as an upgrade as I move and did see this Linksys router and was keen to hear how it went as my previous Linksys needed to be rebooted often.  Have you at any point tried the router in the lower level of your townhouse? I understand that wireless best works top down but with such power in these high end routers these days was hoping down up maybe OK in a 2 story town house."
macsetups,2t3gea,CVraMAN,1 point,Thu Jan 22 05:16:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried. The only place I could put it in the living room is behind/right next to the TV, and that's never good for wireless signals of any kind.   I also like having my iMac connected with ethernet. I share a lot of content over my network from the external drives hooked up to the iMac. Wired is faster and also enables the ""Wake for network access"" feature."

macsetups,2sv0gp,autowikibot,3,Sun Jan 18 23:50:26 2015 UTC,"I've got me a full sized PC crammed into a 1999 G3 iMac case mod (pics). I've got it running a 15"" shit LCD and a 50"" 1080p TV. The most I really want out of it right now is stream video and run Starcraft II on Extreme settings, which it does, swimmingly, at 80FPS stable even on the instant build map (I brought it down to 50FPS though). I'ma try Sim City when I get around to it, I expect similar results.  I'm using a lot of leftover parts from my GPU scrypt mining rig and a G3 I won on eBay a couple years ago for $30. Only thing I've bought for this build that I didn't already have were some panel mount connectors to build the custom I/O panel and the Corsair H90 water cooler for the CPU. The CPU was killing its stock heat sink so I slapped in a Corsair H90 watercooler and it's fantastic. I've got a stable OC of 4.8GHz on the FX-6300 pushing merely 60ºC peak.  I'm still flushing a bug out here and there, one of the things that's bothering me lately is that I don't like how the primary GPU0 is the one sandwiched between the other GPU1 and the CPU cooler radiator/fan. It runs into the 90ºC range when I overclock it while the secondary GPU1 chills out and picks up the slack, I want to set GPU1 as primary and GPU0 as secondary but it's not as simple as it sounds I guess. I might resort to slapping a Kraken adapter and another Corsair H90 on it, removing the case fans from the bottom, and having the primary GPU0 water cooled.  The build was straightforward- in that it was quite obvious that I was hoping to stack a lot of shit into a wee space. It worked out. I am glad I didn't do any research first because I saw some chatter about a full size ATX motherboard being impossible to cram into the case. It did. Along with two GPU's, a monitor, an ATX power supply, case fans, a goddamned water cooler, and all the trimmings.  I'm happy with the way it's performing thus far. It's marginally faster than my 2011 i7 15"" MBPand much faster than 2010 i5 27"" iMac (In case you really wanted to see real 'Macstations' :] ).   It's primarily a gaming and media computer and will remain so. The 15"" 4:3 aspect ratio display I crammed in there isn't quite conducive to daily use so it begs to be hooked to a nice big TV. I really like being able to game on the 50"" while I keep temperature, load monitors, and social media widgets displayed on the 15"" underneath.

macsetups,2sv0gp,runawaysaints,1 point,Sun Jan 18 20:28:50 2015 UTC,"IMac G3:       The iMac G3 is a line of personal computers developed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer from 1998 until 2003. Noted for its innovative design via the use of translucent and brightly colored plastics, it was the first consumer-facing Apple product to debut under the recently returned interim CEO Steve Jobs. The iMac G3, among other factors, was responsible for Apple's turnaround from financial ruin during the late nineties and revitalized the Apple brand as design-oriented and simple. It was, nevertheless, criticized for abandoning then-current technological standards like the floppy drive and the Apple Desktop Bus connector in favor of the emerging USB standard. From its introduction in May 1998, the iMac G3 was updated over time with new hardware and colors until it was supplanted by the iMac G4, as well as the eMac.

macsetups,2sv0gp,runawaysaints,1 point,Sun Jan 18 20:29:26 2015 UTC,How did you fit the full ATX board in there? I've been looking at doing a mod like this for a long time (I gutted my G3) but didn't think a full ATX board would fit in there.
macsetups,2sv0gp,Cap10323,1 point,Sat May 16 17:06:13 2015 UTC,":)  It was a very tight fit. In the front I used some long screws and spacers as standoff mounts for the mobo (notice the machine screw and nut mount on motherboard holes).   I wedged the rear corners into the channel of the plastic shroud that goes around the outer edge where the colored shell meets the opaque bottom.  Make sure not to ground the mobo against that aluminum rack and its hardware (those threaded studs come out if you wiggle them with some pliers).  The aluminum rack is your friend. You will mount your mobo to it and your PSU under it. As PSU's go, I didnt have much problems with conventional ATX length width but the height of the PSU matters, find one that's normal or less than normal height.  For cooling, just get the Corsair CPU cooler or you're going to deal with a lot of fan noise. Trust me on this, $50 well spent.  On that display, getting that to fit is a real craft. Get a 4:3 ratio monitor (WITH DVI INPUT, harder than it sounds) from eBay for $30- start with old Gateway monitors, there seemed to be a lot of those. You'll have to hack it up and solder 12v and 5v in to hook it up to molex.  Keep asking questions and I'll be happy to respond, if i dont respond shoot me a PM."

macsetups,2sv0gp,TheDisarmed,1 point,Mon Jan 19 08:01:01 2015 UTC,"I used a $30 eBay 15"" Gateway LCD, make sure it has DVI. I had a bear of a time finding one with DVI. Find 4:3 ratio. 4:3 ratio is typically reserved for the crappy office computers of >5 years ago.  The one I used was a 1280x768. The iMac is 1024x768. So mine's slightly wider. If you can find a 1024x768 with DVI you're going to have a slightly better fit than I did.  You've got to be careful not to dremel too much material away from the iMac bezel if you want a flusher fit. And the screen is just slightly larger than the opening. I think the CRT is 14"" if that gives you an idea. I removed my Gateway LCD's buttons and hot glued them to the back of the monitors case.  http://i.imgur.com/RZoHSSd.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/cOUkKm7.jpg  http://www.ebay.com/itm/301359248372?_trksid=p2059210.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT"

I'd love to hear what programs you use/how you got to know them really well and if you have any suggestions for beginner designers! Also did you go to college for graphic design??
macsetups,2sg21h,demoror,1 point,Fri Jan 16 06:07:37 2015 UTC,"I started graphic design in middle school (am currently 28 y/o). I was fortunate that the public schools I went to offered graphic design, web design, and other computer heavy courses throughout middle school, junior high, and senior high - so when college came around I didn't feel like a degree in Graphic Design was going to significantly improve my desirability to potential employers, as I already had tons of experience and a very in-depth portfolio. I opted to major in Internet Marketing with a minor in Graphic Design. This way I had more value to offer, and could deeply ingrain myself into whatever company I was hired into by being able to thrive in more than one area. I use Adobe Illustrator heaviest than anything else, next would be Photoshop and FlexiSIGN-Pro. I've dabbled a bit with Affinity Designer and Pixelmatr but find neither of them really give me the same workflow I'm familiar with as I have on the Adobe software. But thats just my opinion.  From my experience, you don't want a laptop as your main machine. Invest your first setup in a desktop (I went 27"" iMac for my home office). Spec out the max you can afford on things you WONT be able to upgrade later yourself (CPU, GPU). Then upgrade the RAM and internal SSD at a later date when your budget will allow. You are going to want a nice large screen, with as much horsepower behind it as you can muster for your main machine.  The reason I say this is most places that are going to be employing you will be putting you at a desk, with a desktop PC or desktop Mac. You'll want to already be comfortable with that platform. If you aren't comfortable with Windows, re-familiarize yourself. You don't want to be unable to perform at a job whose company uses primarily Windows machines. Installing a virtual machine or creating a secondary boot camp image for Windows on your home machine will help you with this. You'll want to be able to FLY around your software regardless of what OS its on.  I held out on buying a laptop until a few years ago (it has since been put to pasture and I am currently saving for a new rMBP). The reason, at least for me, is I want my heaviest hitting machine (my home iMac: http://www.reddit.com/r/macsetups/comments/2qsc55/home_office_battlestation_xpost_from/) to be the machine I work the hardest. Laptops tend to die, or have issues (in my experience) faster than desktops (when putting them through their paces).  As far as getting experience or learning the software or tips: Never EVER stop reading, never stop checking Youtube for tutorials or tips and tricks. Watch as many videos as you can, check as many design blogs as you can. Find a few designers whose style you absolutely adore and FOLLOW their work (not mimic or imitate, but rather familiarize yourself with their work flow, their process, and learn from it).  The field is constantly changing. Trends are constantly changing, what was a very trendy billboard in the early 2000's is considered horrid and ugly by today's standards. You need to be confident in your ability to adapt. And most important, you need to be quick. In my experience, your clients - your boss - your manager, whomever....they aren't going to have the patience for the typical sketching process. Know where to spend your time, and what the expectations of you are.  holy TL;DR....my bad"

A friend gave it too me so, why not put it to use someone)  A spool dock for my not pictured iPhone 6    For the most part, this setup is enough to get me through my studies as a computer science major.

macsetups,2rskls,boxjon,3,Thu Jan 8 23:01:39 2015 UTC,Agreed. Also get some basic cable management and put up some shelfs or something to keep the cruft in on the wall.

Whats the point of that cable management tray below the desk, above the xbox if its just going to hold your router. Move the router somewhere else and place all your wires (Zipped Tied) on there. Make it look pretty, don't HALF ASS it!    How many power surges do you need? Any clutter on the desk needs to go. If you haven't used it in a week let it go! ZIP TIES! ZIP TIES! ZIP TIES! Zip tie everything, make all those wires one wire by zip tying all of them together. I personally would find a way to mount that TV to the wall for a nice clean look and extra space underneath it.

You should pay attention to detail and plug the rightmost plug on the right, the second rightmost to the next slot, and so on. Plugs that take up multiple spaces should go on the end.

Granted, it sort of looks like the walls are unfinished drywall that hasn't been taped and mudded.   The carpet could be trickier if you don't have the means to replace it. You can usually rent a carpet cleaner for $20 bucks and it should help. A temporary fix would be to lay that disheveled piece underneath the legs of your desks completely. You can buy a cheap area rug to put in the corner of the room to hide the fact that it's loose.  Other than the room itself, the suggests the others have mentioned about zip ties and using the ikea cable trays to keep power strips off the floor will do wonders. Other than that, basic cleaning. You'd be surprised at how a clean desk with tamed cables will improve your space even if you're in a basement.  Good luck!"

macsetups,2rc2yp,AngriestBird,1 point,Sun Jan 4 23:33:28 2015 UTC,"Much prefer the Trackpad to the Magic Mouse, or really any other mice I've used. Gestures etc. are very useful, and it's way more ergonomically comfortable -- I don't get hand cramps nearly as often as I did with mice.  The only downside is dragging/dropping and doing very small movements (like changing a number value by dragging up or down) can be a bit finicky, but these things can be adjusted pretty well w/ the right settings.  I have access to a Wacom at work, but never really got used to it and had problems adjusting it to my liking."
macsetups,2rc2yp,AngriestBird,1 point,Mon Jan 5 01:58:40 2015 UTC,Interesting. I (and the other editors) used a magic mouse at the post-production house I interned at last summer and thought some of the features (ie scrolling to the side to scrub through a timeline in Premiere) were nice but overall I didn't like how it acted sensitivity-wise.  The small movements part is the only thing I was really concerned about too! I think I'll give it a try :)

macsetups,2r8q3y,404forlife,1 point,Sun Jan 4 17:23:05 2015 UTC,"I bought the Code specifically for work.  My workflow there is very different than at home because I use so many more Microsoft products (Visual Studio, SQL Server Studio, etc).  I'm much more used to having and using a dedicated F row there, so it made sense to go with a 10-keyless.  Also, when we do paired programming, it makes it easier for others to come and use my keyboard and doesn't require a mental change when I use other developer's keyboards.  Some of the developers I work with might lose their mind if they had to occasionally use a 60%.   At home, the 60% made sense because my workflow here doesn't require the dedicated F row and arrow keys quite so much.  Also, my deskspace isn't suited well for a larger keyboard.    As for Browns vs Clears, I like them both about the same.  The browns might feel a bit more 'likeable', but I can't really give you any tangible reasons as to why. :)"

macsetups,2qhu3g,LilNach,1 point,Sat Dec 27 19:14:40 2014 UTC,"Thanks! A friend had a spare Magic Mouse that he gave to me for free, otherwise I would have bought a trackpad."
macsetups,2qhu3g,AngriestBird,3,Sat Dec 27 21:27:50 2014 UTC,how are those headphones tho damn
macsetups,2qhu3g,moostapha,4,Sat Dec 27 02:39:29 2014 UTC,They're incredible. They have more detail than any headphone I've ever heard and bring out things in songs I've heard many times that I've never noticed before.
macsetups,2qhu3g,KalenXI,1 point,Sat Dec 27 03:08:23 2014 UTC,Do they have all day comfort? do you know how they compare to something like the akg 712?
macsetups,2qhu3g,triple_take,2,Tue Dec 30 00:56:06 2014 UTC,They're pretty heavy and have a very thin headband so they get uncomfortable after a few hours. Supposedly others have had luck making them more comfortable by attaching other headbands to the top with double sided tape. Haven't had a chance to try the akgs so I don't know how they would compare.
macsetups,2qhu3g,mrupert2294,3,Tue Dec 30 03:32:20 2014 UTC,That is insanely clean compared to how my room was in high school. It's utterly unelievable.

macsetups,2qhu3g,billiambobby,1 point,Sat Dec 27 19:43:08 2014 UTC,Yep. Back when it was still popular.
macsetups,2qhu3g,TheMaximusjk,2,Sat Dec 27 21:48:11 2014 UTC,Nice setup! Do you know what desk that is?
macsetups,2qhu3g,morgrar,3,Sat Dec 27 04:24:21 2014 UTC,Thanks! The desk is a combination of two tabletops and matching legs from Ikea. My dad and I joined the tables together by placing brackets underneath the desks and then placed brackets between the now L shaped desk and the wall for extra stability.
macsetups,2qhu3g,GreenTreeL,2,Sat Dec 27 05:18:58 2014 UTC,Thank you for adding what case that was for your iPhone before I had to ask! I've been looking for a nice case for an iPhone 6 I just got and the one have seems to fit the bill perfectly.
macsetups,2qhu3g,GreenTreeL,2,Sat Dec 27 04:45:45 2014 UTC,"Dude your setup is amazing, you should add a wall-mounted monitor and hook it up to your mbp for optimal desk space."
macsetups,2qhu3g,umberdesign,2,Sat Dec 27 17:30:20 2014 UTC,"incredible setup, love the room"
macsetups,2qhu3g,gbdavidx,2,Sat Dec 27 19:48:52 2014 UTC,Very clean and minimalistic. Nicely done.
macsetups,2qhu3g,AngriestBird,1 point,Sat Dec 27 20:59:58 2014 UTC,How are you liking that headphone amp? I am looking to get one but the price range for amps is pretty vast. The one you have is around $140 I believe. Is it good? I'm looking to use it with the Sennheiser 598's.
macsetups,2qhu3g,PwninOBrien92,1 point,Sat Dec 27 21:11:00 2014 UTC,"It's working really well with these headphones, and I'm pretty sure they're harder to drive than the Senns, so you should be good. The guys over at /r/headphones probably know more than I do though."
macsetups,2qhu3g,DeadHorse09,1 point,Sat Dec 27 21:29:39 2014 UTC,"That's what I was thinking. The headphones you have are even crazier than the 598's. I'll also check out that subreddit, though. Thanks!"

macsetups,2qhzpj,3bdol,3,Sat Dec 27 02:58:36 2014 UTC,which led lights did you use?
macsetups,2qhzpj,SethJew,3,Sat Dec 27 20:30:30 2014 UTC,Tell me about that keyboard holder thingy in the first picture. Is there a magic trackpad in there too? It's really neat.

macsetups,2qhzpj,ValiantPixel,2,Sat Dec 27 04:35:53 2014 UTC,sure! made it with C4D.. you can download it here https://www.dropbox.com/s/cx4mgeb1d33buju/111Untitled%201.tif?dl=0

macsetups,2qek83,GhettoGopher,2,Fri Dec 26 00:27:28 2014 UTC,"Probably the last question you were thinking you would be asked, but any reason you picked that mousepad with your magic mouse?"
macsetups,2qek83,TwackyBird,3,Fri Dec 26 01:19:43 2014 UTC,"I just wanted to give it a try because I loved the look of it, so I got it as a christmas gift. Turns out, aluminum and mouse pads shouldn't really go together. You get a grinding feeling when you move the mouse around. But I use the trackpad more often anyway and the mousepad is still aesthetically pleasing to me.   It feels fine with my Logitech mouse, however."
macsetups,2qek83,Phaym,2,Fri Dec 26 01:34:37 2014 UTC,"What monitor mount is that? I'm looking for a mount exactly like that, because it looks so clean."
macsetups,2qek83,industrialwaste,1 point,Fri Jan 2 00:40:41 2015 UTC,I just ordered a mount that looks like the same thing (s)he has. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R9HQLI/
macsetups,2qek83,boredbytes,0,Sat Jan 3 03:33:05 2015 UTC,just search for dual arm monitor mounts on amazon and you'll find it
