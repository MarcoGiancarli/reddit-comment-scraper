toronto,3dr4vs,phillybrownpants,8,Sat Jul 18 17:56:01 2015 UTC,I think the logic is to park like that so people dont ding the side of his car. So parking farther away means people will fill all the empty spots closer to the store front first and not get back so far to park next to him.

toronto,3dqg97,Born_Ruff,3,Sun Jul 19 23:33:06 2015 UTC,Overheard lots of families there talking about how they want to get their kids into track cycling rather than hockey with this new facility.  One dad beside me said he had a 5 and 7 year old and was going to be buying them track bikes instead of hockey equipment. Very cool if this starts to catch on. I was thinking of perhaps buying a track bike and riding here in the winter instead of cross-country skiing.  It was 50 million aproxiamately to build. Let's just hope it's not super expensive to upkeep. Milton is a cycling hotbed in southern Ontario so it was the perfect place to put it.
toronto,3dqg97,blchpmnk,4,Sat Jul 18 18:43:04 2015 UTC,I really think that more and more parents will be steering their kids away from hockey in Canada and football in the US towards less dangerous sports. IMO 10-20 years from now kids will be doing more soccer/basketball/swimming/biking/etc. than hockey.

toronto,3dqie7,i_donno,27,Sat Jul 18 14:08:57 2015 UTC,At the very least the UP train should give you a TTC transfer slip so that people coming from the airport don't also have to pay for TTC to get to their final destination.  Going to Union is really only valuable for commuters who work in the downtown core.  Visitors still need to get to their hotel or wherever they're going.
toronto,3dqie7,CrackingYs,2,Sat Jul 18 15:46:01 2015 UTC,"$Hundred(s) plane ticket $27.50 UP Express $3 TTC   Oh noes, our poor visitors have to pay an extra 1% to use the TTC.   The line has the capacity to being used for a regional commuter service. If things were logical we wouldn't be depending on big brother government agencies."
toronto,3dqie7,Elesh,9,Sun Jul 19 14:02:23 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it's more than just the price. Buying a TTC token is pretty inconvenient (cash only), especially if you're coming from out-of-country (Canadian cash only)."

toronto,3dqie7,giveyourheadashake,9,Sat Jul 18 15:48:16 2015 UTC,The same way they do that on every single other train in the world. Check your tickets.
toronto,3dqie7,Born_Ruff,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:25:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly, GO operates on POP. It's a $300 fine and you can be checked roughly every 5-10 trips depending on when you travel. Statistically it's not worth not paying even if you only consider an isolated trip."
toronto,3dqie7,Elesh,6,Sun Jul 19 14:06:23 2015 UTC,"Oh how I wish  I took the UP from Union to Bloor with my wife and daughter the other day - it was a great ride, and getting from Union to Bloor in 6 - 7 min was fantastic.  I'm just still feeling the pain of paying $33 for our trip instead of $3 (since I have a metropass)."
toronto,3dqie7,goatamousprice,7,Sat Jul 18 19:30:21 2015 UTC,"That would just pack their small trains full of subway commuters. What would make more sense IMO is if they used it as a sort of mini-RER, letting commuters travel between Union/Bloor/Lawrence when Go Trains aren't running, and pay the Go Transit fare. That's what Air Canada does in South America, for example - for their one-stop flights, they let you buy a fairly cheap ticket between the two South American cities"
toronto,3dqie7,amnesiajune,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:03:32 2015 UTC,"If it was crowded it would mean its a success.  Then they could run more trains, raise prices a bit."
toronto,3dqie7,i_donno,8,Sun Jul 19 20:04:03 2015 UTC,"I am not from here, I plan to use the UPX tomorrow when I leave. The price seems steep to even me.   I've used the Canada Line in Vancouver whenever I fly in there because even with the $5 levy on trips to and from the airport, it's ~$8 to get down to Waterfront Station. The point of an airport train line is to offer both convenience to travellers but alternatives to taxi transport which adds to traffic congestion.   Any idea why prices are so high?"
toronto,3dqie7,CalinWat,3,Sat Jul 18 19:30:27 2015 UTC,"Our airport is far. More than twice as far from downtown as Vancouver's. That, combined with the fact that the area around the airport is nothing but industrial parks, makes it prohibitively expensive to build and subsidize a train or subway to the Airport like Vancouver does."
toronto,3dqie7,amnesiajune,47,Sun Jul 19 00:25:35 2015 UTC,"Once again, this is missing the point. The idea behind the UP is to get Pearson to Union travelers to take the train and not drive. It is not about  use as a general transit line, not about getting TTC riders from Bloor to Union. No one at Metrolinx wants the UP to be a general commuters train.  The UP won't be getting a price cut, because the high price is operating as it is intended."
toronto,3dqie7,ockupid2,16,Sat Jul 18 15:03:38 2015 UTC,"As lovely as this ""idea"" is, an idea which doesn't find an audience needs to be reconsidered, particularly in our profoundly fare-dependent local transit situation.  This article is making one argument for how it might find that audience and be made more viable, without in any way sacrificing the original service.  If implementing a system which serves a need isn't the idea, we can indeed chalk this one up as a ""bridge to nowhere"" (as the saying goes).  If using our resources as best we may isn't the idea, we've got a real problem."
toronto,3dqie7,Yst,3,Sat Jul 18 15:34:54 2015 UTC,I think it's far too early to make ANY definitive statement about the upx. Like... Months or years early.

toronto,3dqie7,therealambassador,17,Sat Jul 18 16:39:09 2015 UTC,This. The UPX isn't public transit per say. It's a premium express service and is priced accordingly.

toronto,3dqie7,amnesiajune,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:17:22 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't have been priority over our other infrastructure projects, but considering how terrible this city is with canceling/delaying everything, the UP is a fucking T.O. success story."

toronto,3dqie7,blafunke,13,Sun Jul 19 21:14:09 2015 UTC,This accidentally demolishes any argument for spending public money on the UPX.
toronto,3dqie7,roolb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:51:24 2015 UTC,How? running a reliable express train is massively expensive. Huge amounts of That public money would be going into the train subsidies for every price drop to a ticket. At least this way the tourists and businesses pick up the tab and the train should eventually pays mostly for itself when ridership picks up.
toronto,3dqie7,ItCameFromWeston,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:28:35 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest that public money should really only be spent on goods the average citizen benefits from. That should be broadly defined, of course - I don't want to go to jail, but I'm glad they exist. However, I can't quite see what people who don't live or work very near one of the UPX's few stops get out of this deal. (Some on this thread point to getting drivers off the roads for green purposes, but this is a very small amount of drivers.)"
toronto,3dqie7,roolb,-3,Mon Jul 20 03:07:02 2015 UTC,"So should public money be only spent on transit lines that lose money?

Calling it underutilized because a bunch of anxious dimiwts on reddit don't want to use it it completely fucking stupid. Any new service needs time for ridership to build and has to start with more capacity than is necessary so that as ridership grows it doesn't founder under the pressure.  It's a good thing the whiny fuckwits on this thread will never be in charge of planning anything.

toronto,3dqie7,kidawesome,12,Sat Jul 18 18:38:46 2015 UTC,The funniest thing I saw while cycling past the Bloor UPX station was the fact that there is no tunnel connecting it to the subway station. UPX riders have to hobble down the stairs and then outside up the street a block and then into the subway. That should be fun when its raining or -30 out. What a joke.
toronto,3dqie7,art_738292,14,Sat Jul 18 22:42:33 2015 UTC,"I am in Boston right now. I got off the plane and looked around for the transit, went to the machine to buy a pass and was told it's free from the airport into the city centre.   A massive two car bus with plenty of racks for suitcases or the subway. Two free options.   Visiting other cities always makes me envious. We have always had a small town that got too big and did nothing about it vibe."
toronto,3dqie7,_rand_mcnally_,8,Sat Jul 18 18:12:07 2015 UTC,"Boston's airport is literally beside downtown though. It's about as far as the Island Airport is from Union (which also has a free bus, by the way). When the airport is 30 km away instead of 3 km, it won't be as cheap to get there"
toronto,3dqie7,amnesiajune,-1,Sun Jul 19 00:23:01 2015 UTC,"The distance between Logan Airport and Central Station is 12.3 km. The distance between Pearson and Union is 24km. I think that the extra 12km is comparable considering that this would take you what would be considered the centre of each city's core.   The frequency and size of the buses is also more accommodating to people traveling to and from the airport with luggage at all hours of the day.   Oh and ""by the way"" the only reason there is a ""free"" shuttle to Billy Bishop is because the airline provides it. Not the city."

Its not about the three dollars, it's about the ability to hop onto two different bus lines or a subway line from the airport without a pass, correct currency, or fare.   The buses are larger and more accommodating to luggage. Have you taken the 192? Once there's five people on there with luggage it's jam packed."

More and more people are working and staying up between the hours of 12AM-6AM, massive changes as to how we operate night time transit are needed. At the very least we need to enact non-stop subway service between Friday at 2AM and Monday at 2AM on Line 1, while also increasing the frequency on the 300 to every seven minutes. This will also help with drunk driving by giving clubbers a more convenient, economical choice to get home that doesn't involve paying out the ass for a cab, spending up to two and a half hours waiting for a bus in sometimes horrid weather conditions depending on where you live, or doing something really fucking stupid."
toronto,3dqie7,grifkiller64,10,Sun Jul 19 05:32:57 2015 UTC,"During the launch period, I would like to see them offer discounts or rebates to increase ridership and introduce people to the route. This could also fill the trains and pad their revenue.    I suggest they still charge the same rate (so there is no talk about raising and lowering rares) BUT make discount coupons available to residents or employees, or allow residents to claim rebates they can submit after the fact. Right now I will not take UP at $19. BUT I would love to try it out, for maybe $5-12. And if I like it and it works well for me, I could be persuaded to pay full price in the future and recommend it to visitors."
toronto,3dqie7,PassThePoutine,5,Sat Jul 18 14:52:10 2015 UTC,"I think this is a good idea. Despite my misgivings, I've taken it twice now because I can basically walk out my front door and board the train. It was clean, fast, and only $19 from my stop. It was worth it to me because of the convenience and my ability to have my travel reimbursed. However, both times I've been one of maybe 10 people on the whole train. It would be nice if it was priced to be more affordable to more people."
toronto,3dqie7,riotous_jocundity,-12,Sat Jul 18 17:34:57 2015 UTC,No one gives a shit if you want to try it for cheap. The service is aimed at people who find it valuable now. You have other cheap options and you should use them.
toronto,3dqie7,therealambassador,4,Sat Jul 18 15:05:03 2015 UTC,"That's my point. I'm quite happy without it. But while the service is running at 5% usage, or whatever it was, they could be gaining customers by offering deals. Once the service picks up they could cancel those deals and maintain some of the customers that got to try it and get used to it. While the usage is so low - why not offer the airport employees 50% off monthly passes? Once ridership picks up they can cancel or reduce that discount. The trains are running anyway, there is no cost to doing so. Maybe some employees will choose to continue using it after they have become accustomed to it and the discounts end."
toronto,3dqie7,PassThePoutine,-3,Sat Jul 18 17:22:22 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't gain customers, they might attract one time riders who wouldn't come back for full price rides.

If I'm travelling with someone else (or more) or friends/family want to see me off, we're not paying $55 (minimum for 2 people/one way) for public transit like the UPX if there are cheaper alternatives (splitting the bill on uber or taxi/having someone drive)."

toronto,3dqie7,sadraptorsfan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"if a train system was built when we lack transit in other areas to serve 5000 people a year at most, maybe people have a right to whine?   i dont need it, but you fight for it pretty fucking hard. did you design it? are you working on the line?  they could literally just take that money and pay for private limos for the 5000 people who wanted to take it each year and probably save money."
toronto,3dqie7,arsenefinger,4,Sat Jul 18 16:59:51 2015 UTC,what the fuck are talking about.
toronto,3dqie7,sadraptorsfan,3,Sat Jul 18 17:55:41 2015 UTC,"Therealambassador has been commenting talking shit to anyone who doesn't understand the value of this UPX line.  What don't you understand about my post...   First Line: Why was a UPX line built when we lack transit in areas that ACTUALLY NEED IT. even at max projected ridership, 5000 a day is fucking nothing in comparison to the gta ridership that commutes DT. They prioritized tax dollars towards 5000 executives and pan am tourist needs over the majority of tax payers.  Second line: why is this idiot fighting everyone and being so hostile? people can whine all they fucking want when reporters scoped the ridership out all day during its ""prime"" pan am period and nobody is on teh fucking thing.  Third Line: take all that money spent on building the UPX line, and you could probably save the tax payers money by just giving anyone who would actually use it (ie. the 15 people per train) a free limo ride from there home to the airport. no, i dont advocate doing this, but its just how stupid this thing is. 15 people on a train? 15 x $20-40 ... does that cover fuel? lol"
toronto,3dqie7,therealambassador,5,Sat Jul 18 23:41:12 2015 UTC,"The ridership is expected to be 5000 a day, not 5000 a year. Don't be such a fuckwit."

toronto,3dqie7,therealambassador,-2,Sat Jul 18 23:33:44 2015 UTC,"No, 5000 a day is the estimate for capacity in a year or two, after ridership builds. Only a fuckwit thinks a new service should be at capacity from day one."
toronto,3dqie7,sadraptorsfan,3,Sun Jul 19 03:35:56 2015 UTC,well considering this is the biggest event for people who would possibly use it as tourist in recent memory...   better hope those non-existant union station residing executives dont have companies covering travel costs ;)
toronto,3dqie7,therealambassador,-8,Sun Jul 19 03:43:05 2015 UTC,You should take uber and suck it on the Gardiner / 427 then. UPX is not trying to serve you and don't care what you do.
toronto,3dqie7,sadraptorsfan,10,Sat Jul 18 15:03:21 2015 UTC,"Who are they trying to serve?  The 5000 single mid-level office workers who are in walking distance of union station? Anyone else will just hire a driver. Its not like getting to the airport will take you 5 hours taking a cab. door to door service, rich people arent walking with luggage to union and taking a train in, and if they are going in a group bigger than 1 someone will be lazy and say lets just take a cab. simple as that."
toronto,3dqie7,Section37,11,Sat Jul 18 15:07:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is what I don't understand.  My wife works at a big firm in the financial district. So you'd think we'd know a bunch of people in the UPX target demo. Yet, I can't think of anyone who'd take this thing.   Partners, hell, even associates, all take cabs, Uber blacks, etc. to the airport and bill it to the client.  Also, very few people from the firm go to the airport from the office. Most people fly out in the early morning and take a cab from their house.  Clients take exactly the route the UPX is designed to serve (airport->office/downtown hotel->airport). But, again, they're probably going to take a car; it may be slower, but it's a hell of a lot more convenient.  And were they really imagining people would recommend the train to clients? ""Hi Ms. Y, we're so glad you are going to be able to join us in person for the meeting. Now, when you get off your flight from Tokyo, we want you to walk through the airport to find this train, then take it to Union Station, then fight through the crowds of commuters, then find Bay St. then walk 2 blocks north. If it's raining, you can go through the path; turn left at the  Kupfert and Kim, right at the 3rd dry cleaners..."" Cmon"
toronto,3dqie7,sadraptorsfan,4,Sat Jul 18 16:02:08 2015 UTC,"Nobody is going to use it, nobody thought of a god damn thing except impressing some amateur fucking athletes.  In 5 years it will be a regular service line when they realize its literally empty at current rates.  its a god damn train. it has X number of seats. if you have 10 passangers paying $30 ... why not charge $10 and get 50... profit $200 per car right there and probably get a shit ton more users than just 50. better then twiddling thumbs acting like it was a good plan and probably loosing money on the cost to run the damn trips right now ."
toronto,3dqie7,Section37,3,Sat Jul 18 16:32:33 2015 UTC,UPX Project Plan   Step 1: Build train Step 2: Get PanAm games; impress some amateur athletes Step 3: Get Olympics; impress more amateur athletes Step 4: ???????????? Step 5: Profit (note: is this really necessary? Can't we just get more money from the feds?)
toronto,3dqie7,indiecore,3,Sat Jul 18 16:48:42 2015 UTC,"So there are more than just big law firms downtown and the UPX stops at more than just Union. I'm a developer at a games company downtown, we went to E3 last month and all three people going took the UPX and it was great. Two of us were downtown and took it from Union, I took it from Bloor. UPX is probably how I'm going to go the airport for pretty much any reason now. Much more comfortable than a cab is, more convenient than the TTC, you have wi-fi, space to use a computer and don't need to deal with cabbies."
toronto,3dqie7,Section37,2,Sat Jul 18 16:40:22 2015 UTC,No doubt it's great from the Ubisoft area to the airport. But that's not the main market the UPX is after. The current setup is premised on a lot of downtown-airport business trips. Which seems flawed.   http://stevemunro.ca/2015/04/04/the-dubious-economics-of-the-union-pearson-express/
toronto,3dqie7,Purplebuzz,3,Sat Jul 18 17:20:58 2015 UTC,I fly off the island from downtown vs taking the train north and then back south. With more flights off the island it will only hurt the new train.
toronto,3dqie7,sadraptorsfan,3,Sat Jul 18 17:15:45 2015 UTC,"I figured most take porter or whatever services from the island if possible now too..  I have no idea on costs (not a traveler) but I lived on queens quay with a view of the airport and walked through that metro center porter area a few years back all the time. From when they started construction and the advertising campaigns i was sure they were going to do well... Traffic at the airport increased alot year over year ... lots more cab activity around ... just makes more sense, and quick hopover flights to new york are probably easy from the island."
toronto,3dqie7,therealambassador,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:46:46 2015 UTC,"And? At $19 it's a far better option than a cab for anyone downtown.  Suck on it, they just don't care about you."
toronto,3dqie7,sadraptorsfan,5,Sat Jul 18 16:36:30 2015 UTC,"No, its not, because a cab from union to home even living in the very downtown core will run you min $10 there and back. so now its $40. and 2 stopovers, and waiting for a train schedule.  if you suggest walking to UPX or taking ttc, thats insane. if someone wants to take the ttc to union to take a train to the airport they might aswell just take the subway and transfer over on a bus.. cost ya $3.  the amount of people this is designed for is stupid. suck on what? i dont give a fuck, i dont pay taxes and i dont need a train. just funny they wasted all this time to build a train for the conductor and a couple tourists who got lost at pearson and thought it was the subway."
toronto,3dqie7,Iamascientician,3,Sat Jul 18 16:56:31 2015 UTC,You... don't pay taxes?  How do you figure?
toronto,3dqie7,sadraptorsfan,2,Sat Jul 18 19:07:24 2015 UTC,"i have a taxable income of $0, so my tax bill is a big fat $0.   just thought i should point that out, i have no reason to care as it doesn't affect me, but if i paid taxes that contributed to that crap id be upset. i can see why others should be."
toronto,3dqie7,Iamascientician,3,Sat Jul 18 23:30:33 2015 UTC,"So, you're talking about income tax specifically?  If so, do you not receive any government benefits?  Those are often taxable.  Do you have a residence?  If so, you (or your landlord) are paying property taxes.  Do you purchase goods or services?  If so, you're paying HST.  Do you buy gasoline?  Cigarettes?  Alcohol?  If so you're paying taxes beyond HST."
toronto,3dqie7,therealambassador,0,Sun Jul 19 00:43:56 2015 UTC,"Why the hell would you take a cab downtown, the subway gets you there just as fast?"

toronto,3dqie7,therealambassador,-2,Sat Jul 18 23:35:00 2015 UTC,Are you so fucking stupid that you think only executives travel? Or are you just fucking stupid enough to think all those towers have only executive offices in them.  Fuckwit.
toronto,3dqie7,NinjaAssassinKitty,6,Sun Jul 19 03:32:37 2015 UTC,"Who is the UPX trying to serve?  Worst case scenario, during rush hour, it will take me an hour to get to the airport in a car. And that's absolutely worst case scenario.  TTC will take me 20 minutes to Union, and 25 minutes to Union. This doesn't take into account the time waiting for a bus, then a subway, then the train.  Or I can 'suck it', sitting in the backseat of an air conditioned car that gives me door to door service.  For the added inconvenience, it doesn't save me much, if at all. I might as well take the subway and the airport express from the TTC."
toronto,3dqie7,therealambassador,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:25:59 2015 UTC,"I'm five minutes from Union at the worst of time and I'd take UPX in a second to avoid the highway. All those office towers are also full of people who travel for business and need a quick way to get to the airport.  UPX doesn't care about you, so stop bitching."
toronto,3dqie7,NinjaAssassinKitty,5,Sat Jul 18 16:34:13 2015 UTC,"The only person bitching here is you really. You can't seem.to have a discussion without resorting to snide remarks.  Fantastic, you're 5 minutes away so it's convenient for you. Most people aren't, but clearly you're too thick to understand that.  Enjoy your limited, personal viewpoint on life."
toronto,3dqie7,therealambassador,-2,Sat Jul 18 17:32:40 2015 UTC,"If it's not convenient for people, they should use a different option and not be whiny bitches."
toronto,3dqie7,Frawg,2,Sat Jul 18 17:41:44 2015 UTC,"Who goes to the airport directly from the office when leaving on a business trip? When I fly business I leave from home and go back home from the airport, so I take a taxi. When people from other offices visit they come in groups and don't know or care about the local transit system, so they take taxis.   I've taken the UPX once and found it a pain in the ass to get to Union beforehand.  The process goes 'roll suitcase along pavement for a long distance -> take elevator down to subway fare level from the street -> drop $3 into the machine to get a token and then manhandle suitcase through automated turnstile because the other end of the station is too far away -> carry suitcase down escalator because there is no second elevator to track level -> wait God knows how long for subway to arrive -> spend 20 minutes riding the subway down to union -> carry suitcase up stairs, through turnstiles, and up more stairs to get into the GO station -> wait in line to put $19 on Presto card -> walk another long distance to the UPX platform -> finally get on the train to Pearson and wait 25 minutes'.  Compare that to a taxi where it's 'call taxi, take 25 minute trip to the airport, make sure you get a receipt because the company is the one paying and you don't give a fuck how much it costs'.   Taking it on the way back is equally pointless, as nobody wants to arrive downtown on a Friday night and go through the reverse process after experiencing flying. I took it out of curiosity and the actual train ride is very pleasant, but everything around it is such a pain that I wonder who this was actually meant for."
toronto,3dqie7,therealambassador,3,Sat Jul 18 16:53:31 2015 UTC,"People go from the airport directly to their business meeting / downtown hotel all the time. Your stupidity is no argument.  If you don't like the service, don't take it. It's aimed at business travelers who tend to travel light and want to have a fast direct service to the airport. Whiny dimwits can take uber."
toronto,3dqie7,Frawg,4,Sat Jul 18 17:49:45 2015 UTC,"It's amazing that you have such insight.  Explain to me how these hordes of light-packing business travelers who go directly downtown all the time mastered invisibility, because they don't seem to be on the trains."
toronto,3dqie7,therealambassador,-2,Sat Jul 18 18:09:49 2015 UTC,This is the slowest time of the year for business travel. It's the slowest time of year for everything business related...  What makes stupid people so prone to complaining?
toronto,3dqie7,ahhdurian,3,Sat Jul 18 18:17:28 2015 UTC,isn't the whole point of the UPX to server people? yknow....so they can get around?
toronto,3dqie7,therealambassador,-1,Sat Jul 18 15:20:35 2015 UTC,"Sure, but it's never going to be the only game in town. There will always be other options and those other options will be a better choice for some people. IF UPX isn't for you, don't use it."
toronto,3dqie7,Kyouhen,2,Sat Jul 18 16:35:03 2015 UTC,Is U-P fare good for a round trip? Or is it like TTC and I'm expected to pay a second time after my friend gets on the plane and leaves?
toronto,3dqie7,udunehommik,6,Sat Jul 18 16:14:33 2015 UTC,"There's a ""meet and greet"" fare that allows you to go from Union to Pearson and back for the cost of one fare (that expires in 3 hours), as well as a ""long layover"" fare that allows you to go from Pearson to Union and back for the cost of one fare (that expires in 6 hours)."

toronto,3dqie7,briguy57,2,Sat Jul 18 18:09:30 2015 UTC,$19 with presto. Very easy to gloss over that when you're trying to make a political point.
toronto,3dqie7,reputable_opinion,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:10:41 2015 UTC,the fare was probably set so high to satisfy the limo mafiia.    as it is 2 people might as well take the convenience of the cab.   the train ought to be $8.00 max.
toronto,3dqie7,Flincher14,7,Sat Jul 18 18:50:14 2015 UTC,Hm do I want to pay 27 dollars to get from Pearson to Union or 3 dollars? Not much of a bloody choice. If anything the ride should be 10-15 bucks.
toronto,3dqie7,mongo5mash,5,Sat Jul 18 18:22:32 2015 UTC,"Every time I see the ridership numbers, I can't help but think that they set their bar incredibly low for it to be ""on track"". Given it's summer and we have a bunch of visitors, it looks like that demographic isn't using it at all. If it's going to be all business people and be low capacity anyways, make it $50 even. That way there's no need for volume.  This is all assuming, of course, that their ridership goal is revenue neutral at the very least, and to make some money best case scenario. (It's business users after all - not like it's taxing working families)"

toronto,3dqie7,cito-cy,6,Sun Jul 19 16:37:04 2015 UTC,"Isn't that the point of GO? (I don't actually live in Toronto, not familiar)  Here in Hong Kong, the Tung Chung Line and Airport Express run largely on the same trackage except where the Airport Express diverges to service the airport. The Tung Chung Line is the cheaper commuter service,  the Airport Express is the premium service with train interiors fitted out for comfort and to accommodate luggage.   Aren't they upgrading the GO corridor to provide something like the Tung Chung Line? Frequent local service?"
toronto,3dqie7,az78,5,Sat Jul 18 14:36:30 2015 UTC,"They are upgrading GO (which will take 7-10 years) to provide frequent local service, but it doesn't go to the airport now and there are no plans to integrate that trackage at the moment (hopefully that changes).   At the moment, the alternative is taking a subway and then transferring to a bus. From Union, it takes about 90 min to get to the airport and costs $3. Whereas the UP Express takes 25 min and costs $19 with Presto. For 2 people, using Uber instead is competitive. For 3 or more, Uber or Taxis is much better.  What people want (myself included) is a public transit choice that is in the middle of those two public transit options."

It's pretty well established that an animal living in a cage is depressed and stressed versus living in the wild.  Let's be honest - the only one benefiting is the owner of the cage.
toronto,3dqywx,candleflame3,15,Sat Jul 18 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"The rabbits people keep as pets are not really wild and would fare very poorly in the wild, much like cats.  With proper care, play and stimulation, they do just fine.  Pro-tip: you don't keep them in the cage all the time, and you make the cage super-comfy.  Rabbits like their hidey-holes and that is essentially what the cage is, if you do it right."

toronto,3dr0wt,adoptedCanadIAN,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:21:06 2015 UTC,But either is technically a mistake.
toronto,3dr0wt,dittomuch,2,Mon Jul 20 00:56:10 2015 UTC,"Judgement caused by poor reasoning..true. But you could also say ""judgement caused by poor intentions""...basically the same I guess. Doesn't really matter."
toronto,3dr0wt,adoptedCanadIAN,3,Mon Jul 20 01:15:59 2015 UTC,I might not be screaming for her job or anything as she is a writer I do occasionally read and enjoy but it was a mistake in a much more grand sense of the article in general and not a simple factual detail mistake.  Her article paints a very different picture than the video footage and it was done as a personal attack on Ezra Levant.  The Toronto Star has mocked Ezra Levant in past for his 'mistakes' and they have made one pretty big one with Porters' column.
toronto,3dr0wt,dittomuch,12,Sat Jul 18 19:20:24 2015 UTC,"I don't see that as a mistake, I see that as an intentional distortion of the truth.   It's also sad because had Levant not recorded anything, everyone would have assumed that her ""story"" is 100% factual."
toronto,3dr0wt,adoptedCanadIAN,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:29:11 2015 UTC,Yeah after taking a walk it might be resignation letter worthy...  Feel bad for her on this but it was pretty bad.
toronto,3dr0wt,dittomuch,7,Sat Jul 18 19:56:55 2015 UTC,"Part of me feels bad, especially because she has a daughter to take care of, but this was not an accident, and many people would lose their job for intentionally lying.   The Star would look bad if they choose to keep her."
toronto,3dr0wt,adoptedCanadIAN,2,Sat Jul 18 20:28:19 2015 UTC,grrr and there is the thing I have a natural bias to let a mom slide on things and I might be doing it....  deep in me somewhere there is a certain sexism which plays out in cases like this.  If it was Hume I would be glad to see his head on a stick with it being Porter I'm softer.  I suck and I'm admitting it  (upvoting you for the conversation tone much appreciated)
toronto,3dr0wt,dittomuch,3,Sat Jul 18 20:37:38 2015 UTC,"You don't suck, you're sharing your opinion and you're showing you have empathy. Nothing wrong with that :)"
toronto,3dr0wt,Death_Balloons,2,Sat Jul 18 20:44:50 2015 UTC,Yeah but in this case the empathy is being applied based on her being a mom and her daughter being a cutie and not based on her being an equal to for instance Hume who I use because I dislike while I have a soft spot for Porter same as I have a soft spot for Heather Mallick.  I am often more harsh on Royson James or Martin Cohn than I would be to Mallick and it actually comes from a charatcer sexism that really is there even if I don't entirely want it.
toronto,3dr0wt,adoptedCanadIAN,3,Sat Jul 18 20:49:21 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I can't stand Mallick. She makes me want to rip out my eyes with her incessant overuse of sarcasm."

toronto,3dr0wt,Barnibus666,2,Sat Jul 18 20:56:42 2015 UTC,"I can't believe Porter was intentionally making stuff up. She knew Levant was filming the encounter, it would be idiotic to knowingly falsify what he was saying when it was all on tape.  I think what happened is that she had this encounter with Levant, and a day later she sat down to write her column without the benefit of notes or recordings, based on her own memory. The human memory is far from perfect, so it was pretty sloppy to write a column this way. Maybe it normally works when she is writing about Haitian earthquake victims or dying children or whatever, where she might not get every quote 100 percent right but she gets the essential core of the story right. A lot of famous old-school reporters did things this way, Truman Capote famously didn't really take many notes while writing ""In Cold Blood"", and some people have question how accurate it it, but it's a true crime classic.  Against Levant though, Porter was totally out of her depth. Levant is like an aggressive trial lawyer, he jumps on every mistake his opponents make. If you're going to go after him in a column, you can't do it in such a sloppy fashion, or you're going to get eaten alive. I think Porter seriously underestimated Levant, and she wound up paying for it."
toronto,3dr0wt,poppinmollies,2,Sun Jul 19 04:09:19 2015 UTC,"Just a slight correction. While Ezra has a law degree, I don't believe he's every practiced. However, he is an award winning debater (he was a partner with Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi), so you're correct in him being able to eat his opponents alive when they make sloppy mistakes.  He's very quick on his feet with arguments."

toronto,3dr0wt,adoptedCanadIAN,-4,Sun Jul 19 23:06:28 2015 UTC,"I'll probably get downvoted for this since the thread seems to be pretty firmly against Porter already, but if you watch the video Levant put up in response, it actually seems to confirm most of the relevant aspects of her account, and leaves a lot open to interpretation.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBHjU3x8Sdg   Sorry that it's a 20 minute long video, but Levant apparently doesn't want to just post to unedited video, but instead dice it up into few second long clips between long winded rants.  For example, Levant denies that he was belittling the guy in a chicken suit, but his video shows that he was asking him if he was pro or against farting. I think that can easily be interpreted as a belittling line of questioning.  Ezra denies that the girl approached him, and says that Porter waived him over. As proof, he shows a few seconds of Porter giving permission for him to speak with her daughter. It doesn't actually show anything about who approached who.  He says he was talking to the child respectfully, but he was just doing his same old bullshit. When she asked if he believed in climate change, he goes on a long tangent about the general idea of ice ages. When Porter steps in to make the obvious clarification that she was referring to human caused climate change, Levant says ""that's not what she said."" I don't think this kind of ""gotcha"" nitpicking is very respectful to a child.  He then refuses to answer the question about human caused climate change and instead starts to build the case that her mommy is a hypocrite because she doesn't own an electric car.  When he turns to talk to Porter, all he does it launch repeated personal attacks against her and calls her a hypocrite in front of her daughter.  The last point, about her saying ""You're talking to my mommy, you know, right?"" vs ""You're being mean to my mommy"" is a perfectly easy mistake to make without the benefit of a recording. The intent behind the comment was clearly accurately portrayed. Her daughter was very upset with how Levant was treating her mom."

My thoughts:   For example, Levant denies that he was belittling the guy in a chicken suit, but his video shows that he was asking him if he was pro or against farting.   Yes, and as you can see he asked the question in a joking matter, which was acknowledged by the guy in the chicken suit. Watch here.   Ezra denies that the girl approached him, and says that Porter waived him over. As proof, he shows a few seconds of Porter giving permission for him to speak with her daughter. It doesn't actually show anything about who approached who.   The Star editor watched the full footage and confirmed that the girl was standing by and waiting, and that Levant didn't approach them. Porter even told Levant ""My daughter has a question for you"" (Or something along those lines).   He says he was talking to the child respectfully, but he was just doing his same old bullshit. When she asked if he believed in climate change, he goes on a long tangent about the general idea of climate change. When Porter steps in to make the obvious clarification that she was referring to human caused climate change, Levant says ""that's not what she said.""    What they talked about doesn't matter. I don't agree with a single thing he said, but he conveyed his points in respectful manner. Porter decided to focus on the fact that he was rude, saying ""My daughter's first protest started with a fight."" and ""my nine-year-old was preparing to brawl with Levant"", both of which are factually untrue.    He then refuses to answer the question about human caused climate change and instead starts to build the case that her mommy is a hypocrite because she doesn't own an electric car. When he turns to talk to Porter, all he does it launch repeated personal attacks against her and calls her a hypocrite in front of her daughter.   Yes, he avoided the question, but in a way he did catch Porter as being a hypocrite. Obviously we all can't be perfect eco-friendly humans, but he was right in saying that she valued personal convenience over eco-friendly products (example: her use of a non-electric car). It wasn't a personal attack, it was an attack on her beliefs. Did he call her a hypocrite? Yes, because she is. Same way I am against animal abuse but continue to eat meat daily. I am a hypocrite.

Yes, the daughter was upset, but as the editor stated, journalists are supposed to be taking notes so that quotes don't get misconstrued. One could also argue that the girl didn't think he was being mean, but more that she didn't like them arguing.  I see where you're coming from and I'll upvote you for your opinion, but I disagree with your points. While I do not like Ezra Levant (his article about Kanye made me furious), I do fell that Catherine Porter was entirely in the wrong her, and violated journalistic integrity. Clearly the editor, someone much smarter and knowledgeable than myself, felt the same way.   That is why I think Porter should be fired. Even when you find a way to defend her actions (with valid points, which you brought up), it is still possible to find wrongdoing."

The Star reporter says that the video clearly shows Lyla approaching Levant to speak with him.  ""The raw video shows, as Porter wrote, that her daughter did indeed go over to talk with Levant, placard in hand. It clearly captures Lyla hovering in the background, waiting to talk to Levant as he interviewed others. But it also clearly shows him saying that he does not want a “little person” on film.""  Levant makes it seem like Porter was the one who initiated the interaction, but the video apparently shows that it was Lyla. The omitted part was that Levant asked for permission from Porter before filming her.   What they talked about doesn't matter. I don't agree with a single thing he said, but he conveyed his points in respectful manner.   I disagree with you on this. I don't think it is respectful to play gotcha journalism with a 9 year old. Trying to use the nine year old to build a case that her mom is a hypocrite is not respectful. Tone of voice is not the only relevant issue here.   ""My daughter's first protest started with a fight."" and ""my nine-year-old was preparing to brawl with Levant"", both of which are factually untrue.   Well, no. They are not ""factually untrue"". They are subjective comments. Her daughter going over to try and talk with Levant could be described as her ""preparing to brawl"" with him. The whole encounter between the three of them could be described as a fight. It is a colorful way to describe it, but it can't really be said to be ""wrong"".   Yes, he avoided the question, but in a way he did catch Porter as being a hypocrite.

What isn't respectful is to use your child as a political pawn when they aren't fully aware of what they're talking about. Levant even acknowledged this, saying that he didn't want to interview the girl because she didn't really understand. When I say respectful I mean that he was polite and not rude to her, even though he could have been confrontational and mean. When you hear the word fight, you don't think of a debate. You think something along the lines of shouting and disrespectful comments. None of these were present. Both parties had a friendly, and slightly heated debate. But it was not a fight. How is that a personal attack? Calling her out for what she does in relation to what she's protesting? That's not personal in my opinion. Fair point. Her daughter is angry, but every single fact that she misconstrues is a strike against her. She's a journalist, and journalists can't just go around misquoting people even if the meaning is similar.    edit: actually I'm wrong, I just reread the editor's article:    The column also misleads by not telling readers that Levant was reluctant to talk to Porter’s daughter at all because he prefers not to interview children. She also omits the fact that she asked him to talk with her daughter, when the little girl could not get Levant’s attention.   So Porter clearly initiated the conversation."

Kathy English Public Editor Toronto Star  On the issue of fairness, Porter’s column distorts what the camera shows us in telling readers in the first sentence that, “My daughter’s first protest started off with a fight.” From this, the reasonable reader would likely conclude that Levant, whom Porter described as a “right-wing broadcasting bully” had brawled with a nine-year-old girl. As the video shows, Levant was kind and gentle to Lyla, engaging with her in a charming manner. Porter column is misleading in not telling readers that Levant played nice with her daughter.

Not rude, not mean. and not making someone uncomfortable.   His constant use of personal attacks is disrespectful. You can tell that he is making Porter and her daughter quite upset.

Porter corrected Lyla by rewording the original question. Also, it's clear the Lyla did not know what she was talking about. She couldn't get simple facts right, and appeared to say what most likely had been told to her by her mom. An example of this is when she said she knew nothing about Tesla, which is very well known and anyone with an interest in climate change would at least know the name of. Also, the mere fact that she agreed with Levant's points shows she didn't have any evidence to prove him wrong (and there's lots of evidence to prove him wrong). Also, her question was ""do you believe in climate change"" and he answered properly. Making someone upset does not mean that you're personally attacking them. She was upset because he was calling her a hypocrite for not practicing what she preached. I still don't see any personal attacks, can you tell me which part of the video you're referring to? Calling someone out for what they do isn't automatically personal.  Example: I am against animal abuse. However, I wear a Canada Goose coat that has Coyote fur, and many have shown that the animals are poorly treated. Any animal rights activist can call me out for my choice because it is hypocritical.  From the Star editor: ""While Porter told me Lyla did say the words she reported at some point after the encounter, that’s not what the camera shows.

I can see how you can interpret it that way, but if you really think about it, it is very easy for someone to interpret it as belittling.  The term belittling is in no way dependent on how the subject reacts to it.   She didn't seem that nervous, and even if she was, she could still know a bit about what she's talking about. Someone asks about a Tesla, and you say you don't know what that is? That's not caused by nervousness.   Have you ever dealt with kids?

How is calling someone a hypocrite not an attack on their character?  I'm not saying that questioning someone's personal character and actions is never appropriate, but it was very much inappropriate in this case.  A nine year old girl was trying to talk to him about climate change. He refused to answer the spirit of her question, and tried to prove that her mommy was a hypocrite.   That was responding to you when you said it wasn't fire-able. I was just providing a bit more insight and showing that she violated standards.   I definitely don't think that is the part that would come anywhere close to a fireable offense. The bigger issue would be if she identified herself as a journalist or if she slandered the guy. Not getting the wording of this quote exactly right is probably the smallest issue here.   I realize that I'm taking one misquote a bit too seriously, but when she makes many errors it makes everything look bad.   The whole thing was definitely a misfire by Porter, but I think Levant is doing what he does best and drumming up hysteria way beyond what is appropriate."

toronto,3dr0wt,thegreathall,8,Sat Jul 18 17:12:50 2015 UTC,Moments ago I published simple links no intended opinion.  Here is Ezra's video response.  It is harsh but he has a point...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFWxSsAPpuU  If this was the other way around we would be tearing Ezra a new one.  He tears her a new one in this video response and its going to sting but Porter appears to be in the wrong on this one.  Her response might be delayed as it appears she wrote her original letter before leaving for a planned trip.  But his point about the one sided nature of accountability is fair he twists it into an argument I don't support but she was mixing a nasty thing with her original article.

toronto,3dr0wt,K00PER,4,Sat Jul 18 18:27:20 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say typical...usually their reporting is good. It's just a few of their columnists that are terrible.

toronto,3dr0wt,Ciderbat,3,Sun Jul 19 14:16:06 2015 UTC,"Few people consider Levant to be a journalist, but as much as I disagreed with many of Porter's columns I did consider her to be one. Now I'm not so sure.   As others have already stated, she went well beyond a mistake and the Star's editorial tried to turn it into ""he said, she said"" even though it admits to ""journalistic failure"" on her part. Clearly they aren't going to let her go over this but a slap on the wrist makes it seem like she's getting off very lightly."

He was pretty proud, he looked like a true metal head - and for the final ""show"" of the contest he was dropped off a platform some 100ft high over a swimming pool on these bungee cords, and the whole time flying up and down there was Master of Puppets playing in the back ground and he was air drumming the whole thing - arms and legs spread out in the perfect position that looked like he was exactly behind a drum kit, headbanging the whole way.   Haha, yeah, it was amazing. Good TV. This - doesn't seem that fun. I mean, unless they have to tightrope over a fish tank of turtles or pirahnas or something, I'm not going."

toronto,3dnyr8,Galestar,7,Sat Jul 18 00:14:49 2015 UTC,through his insurance or via a civil suit   I got the feeling from the article that this was not the kind of 'justice' the plaintiff was looking for.
toronto,3dnyr8,Ahrotahntee_,6,Sat Jul 18 02:08:52 2015 UTC,"True, but it seems to me that the kind of justice she was looking for is highly unlikely to be found in traffic court at all."
toronto,3dnyr8,rerek,38,Sat Jul 18 15:27:35 2015 UTC,"wow - why did the guy try to drag her into traffic after? trying to make it seem like someone else hit her? especially despicable considering she may have had spinal injuries too, which it seems like she did. what a sick fuck."
toronto,3dnyr8,coralshroom,19,Fri Jul 17 21:57:42 2015 UTC,Cant say that was what he was doing or not. But he may have been in shock and trying to get her untangled from the bike. Most people fuck up on the whole not moving the person.
toronto,3dnyr8,phillybrownpants,57,Fri Jul 17 22:28:26 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm the guy in this story. He was trying to close his door and her bike was in the way. I repeatedly told him to stop, but he refused.  My thought is if the door was closed, he could argue it was barely open and we were riding too close (which is exactly what he told the cop)."
toronto,3dnyr8,mnkybrs,9,Fri Jul 17 22:56:02 2015 UTC,"The way the article portrays it, there would have been absolutely no compensation had she even won. No lawyer for her was mentioned, and it seemed like despite much preparation from lawyer friends, nobody had a clue what was going on. The cop also was never discussed as showing at the trial. Would you be able to provide a clearer picture as to what really happened and what she would have wanted to receive?"
toronto,3dnyr8,audiberry,23,Fri Jul 17 23:16:46 2015 UTC,"Any criminal charge is ""The Crown"" vs. the defendant.  The victim of the crime is not the plaintiff.  The victim of the crime is not pursuing justice; the government is.  The victim is only there as a witness to testify as to what happened.  If the injured party wanted to receive compensation, she would have to pursue a separate civil suit against the motorist.  Damage caused by the driver should be covered by the driver's auto insurance."
toronto,3dnyr8,jellicle,0,Sat Jul 18 00:39:35 2015 UTC,"It seems like in this case, the Crown wasn't very interested in pursuing justice, at least from the victim's perspective. Any idea why she would voluntarily lessen the charge? Would she have already met/made some kind of agreement with the driver's lawyer?"
toronto,3dnyr8,jellicle,22,Sat Jul 18 01:19:01 2015 UTC,"The fine for dooring is $300 to $1000.  The fine for failure to signal is $85, I think.  Both are two demerits, I believe.  So nutshell: the deal saved the guy $200 or so, which the lawyer will take in fees.  The deal could have been for something with no demerits, but it wasn't.  So at least his insurance will probably go up.  From the government's perspective, the extra $200 fine might not be worth spending an afternoon (or longer) on this case.  From their perspective, it was an accident that injured a cyclist but not too badly - she can still walk and talk and so on.  I don't mean to minimize her experience - I'd be PISSED if I got seriously doored, and I spend a lot of effort avoiding that while cycling in Toronto.  But from the government's perspective it's not so bad.  It's not like the prosecutor doesn't care, but they care only in the abstract.  You're just a number."
toronto,3dnyr8,bigjilm123,2,Sat Jul 18 01:39:32 2015 UTC,"FYI, demerits don't cause insurance to rise.  Insurance is based on the number of moving violations, plus accidents and criminal charges.  Source - I have ticket troubles and have done the research, plus have a sister in the business."
toronto,3dnyr8,mnkybrs,7,Sat Jul 18 13:34:24 2015 UTC,We didn't want compensation. We wanted this guy to face more than a slap on the wrist for doing something that could have killed her.
toronto,3dnyr8,LumpenBourgeoise,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:41:41 2015 UTC,Did the guys car insurance cover the physio and such? Or does that depend on a ruling in court?  Or was physio covered by healthcare referral without any extra cost in the end?

toronto,3dnyr8,cdnbroker,14,Sat Jul 18 02:16:24 2015 UTC,"She should have sued for considerably more... She could have easily won significantly more in compensation.  Depending on the permanency of her injuries, her inability to work, lost income, etc she could have a sizeable claim.  If she hasn't signed a settlement with his insurance ( sounds like she did) she needs to speak to a personal injury lawyer ASAP."
toronto,3dnyr8,lxpatterson,3,Sat Jul 18 02:37:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  The longer you drag on the injury claims and various assessments and so on, the bigger the eventual settlement.  The problem is it can become a full-time job and start eating into your professional and personal life."
toronto,3dnyr8,mnkybrs,6,Sat Jul 18 02:51:58 2015 UTC,Which is exactly what we're not interested in doing.
toronto,3dnyr8,mnkybrs,3,Sat Jul 18 03:23:51 2015 UTC,We didn't sue and this wasn't about money for us. We wanted him to be charged and punished for the severity of what he did.
toronto,3dnyr8,OnLakeOntario,18,Sat Jul 18 02:48:00 2015 UTC,"It does need to be about money. The thing with injuries like this is that all of the results don't just show up at once and will plague her for the rest of her life... You have to be prepared for what will most likely be reduced mobility at a much younger age. I had a family member that was hit by a car that lost control at around 1-3 MPH in an icy parking lot about 14 years ago, and she's now 54 and has had to get a spinal fusion as a result of that incident putting excessive strain on her spine. Luckily she's American (not a phrase I ever use), and the lawyer challenged for it. The additions to their long time home to make life easier post-injury/surgeries have been paid for by what she was awarded."
toronto,3dnyr8,Dose_of_Reality,17,Sat Jul 18 03:29:39 2015 UTC,"We wanted him to be charged and punished for the severity of what he did   Ok.  Except there is no jail time for any of the traffic offences committed here.  There is no charge for the action here that will give you what you want.  The victim has no avenue to ""get what she wants"" other than to pursue remedy in civil court.  So if you want him to be punished he needs to feel it in his wallet.  If you don't like that then its not the court's fault, nor the prosecutors.  You need to raise a stink with your law makers in order to introduce special provisions in the HTA for serious 'dooring' incidences."
toronto,3dnyr8,beltzner,4,Sat Jul 18 03:26:42 2015 UTC,The way you do that is with a civil suit. That's what those are for.   Please understand that the only thing this guy is being charged with is a traffic violation. Those get negotiated all the time to keep court costs down.
toronto,3dnyr8,lapsed_pacifist,2,Sat Jul 18 08:17:53 2015 UTC,"I get why you didn't want to pursue a civil case, but it might have been helpful here. Having your own lawyer to act as your advocate would have ensured that your side of the story would be heard, which seems to be something your partner is really upset about.   I don't know if this case would be workable -- seeing as how this must have taken place some time ago. Still, particularly in light of your partner facing the prospect of chronic back pain, it might not be a bad idea to look into it."

Sure the driver is a piece of shit, but was she expecting a jail time for the guy? How did the system fail? He got a lesser ticket, ok, insurance companies do not care what ticket is for or how bad it is. Just how many. Well he got a moving violation ticket, get enough of those and your insurance will drop you.  Am I missing something?"

toronto,3dnyr8,not_an_actual_lawyer,3,Fri Jul 17 23:21:32 2015 UTC,The bigger issue seems to be dragging the victim away from the scene of the collision to avoid criminal or civil liability.

toronto,3dnyr8,ahwsun,8,Sat Jul 18 00:56:33 2015 UTC,It's illegal to interfere in any way with the police and paramedics duties at an accident scene. You simply do not move the accident victim before ems arrives.
toronto,3dnyr8,morgang8277,3,Sat Jul 18 01:54:08 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain its only illegal once the police/paramedic's arrive, they most likely weren't there at that point. Most people get caught up in the moment and forget not to move the victim."
toronto,3dnyr8,kovu159,3,Sat Jul 18 10:21:13 2015 UTC,"That's a different matter. The comment I was replying too said the driver was attempting to drag the victim away form the scene of the collision. That is not what happened.   Additionally, to help administer first aid or move someone away from danger, you absolutely can move them. What do you expect people to do, freeze in place until police arrive? People would die."

If a car in front of you, and stops on it's own (via it's brakes), no matter how fast it stops, and you rear-end this car, it's your fault, because it's assumed that since the car in front of you stopped within it's own ability to do so, so should your vehicle be able to, if you aren't following too close. The key here is that you should be driving within the operational limits of your vehicle (stopping distance), and if you aren't, that's on you.  In the case where you rear end someone in front of you, because that car rear-ended the one in front of them, the car in front of you stopped suddenly and without warning, and faster than the normal mechanisms (brakes) of a car would normally allow. This means it's not your fault, because the sudden stop of the car in front of you can cause you to crash into it, even when safely operating your vehicle within it's operational limits.  Obviously there can be outlying circumstances and exceptions to either of these cases, because nothing is that clear cut, but that is generally the basics."

My point is only that one should not expect ""retributive justice"" for this sort of thing in the criminal courts. Even in cases of serious injury and death, there is often little ""retributive justice"" for cyclists.  Only in high visibility cases (with celebrities or unusual callousness) where prosecution is demanded by ""the mob"" does the crown really put in a big effort, the example I can think of is that Michael bryant case from several years ago."
toronto,3dnyr8,blafunke,4,Sat Jul 18 03:29:51 2015 UTC,"Poor girl :( As someone who drives daily downtown I'm always concerned about cyclists. I've gotten into the habit of always checking my mirror when stepping out, doing two blind spot checks, and hugging the curb when making a right turn.  At night and in the rain it's always the worst, especially when droplets form on mirrors and it gets harder to clearly make out a cyclist.   And (if you're a cyclist) actually use the bike lanes. I see countless cyclists still cycling in traffic on Adelaide/Richmond when there's a perfectly good dedicated bike lane, it just creates unnecessary danger.."
toronto,3dnyr8,hedgecore77,3,Sat Jul 18 16:27:13 2015 UTC,"Many bike lanes are right in the sweet spot of the door zone. Shuter street bike lane is a joke. Harbord and Dundas east are other notable dooring lanes.  You need to ride just outside bike lanes like that to be clear of potential dooring. Harbord is nice if you use it right. Again you need to be on the outside edge of the painted buffer to be clear of the door zone. On 4 lane arterials with parking you've got to be right on the white dashed lines between lanes, or in some cases (narrower lanes and/or shitty parking jobs) you need to encroach on the center lane. I'm sure riding that far out disturbs drivers but fuckit! I'll be damned if I'm going to go near the door zone."
toronto,3dnyr8,Right_All_The_Time,2,Sat Jul 18 17:52:08 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, do you pull up beside a car on the right while it's signaling a right hand turn? I just started driving last year and that's the most maddening thing. You've got to worry about pedestrians running across as the lights change, perpendicular traffic running a yellow (usually you can't turn until you've got the green because traffic is heavy), and checking your blind spot to make sure someone on a bike hasn't pulled up.   I'm lucky that I still drive consciously but this city is full of nut bars in cars, on bikes, and on foot."
toronto,3dnyr8,torontotemporary,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:23:29 2015 UTC,"The whole pulling on the right thing is a constant source of anxiety for drivers and cyclist alike. As a cyclist I try to move to the left of vehicles if I am going straight and they are turning. That being said I do that as an experienced and confident cyclist who feels safe basically taking over that right lane once your car turns right. If we are waiting at a red light I don't mind being on the left side of the car and wedged between two car lanes. The issue is many many other cyclists do not feel comfortable in that spot. They are conditioned to stay as close to the right curb as possible. The right curb is the safety zone. The unwritten contract so to speak between drivers and cyclists. In addition what complicates this further is sometimes a vehicle behind your turning car won't be turning, they will be going straight. So cyclists have the possibility of being between two fast moving lanes of cars after your car has turned. That makes getting back to the curb risky. The other thing is there is a conception that you as a driver are often going to be blocked from completing your right turn by pedestrians. So they think you are going to be stalled there so may as well bike on the right and pass the intersections with the pedestrians. As someone that drives and bikes I can see where you're coming from, it's a turning spot not a passing spot, but sucks as it may be you have to get their reasoning behind what they are doing. They feel a lot more exposed on the street and the curb is where they are using to stopping at all times."
toronto,3dnyr8,permareddit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:29:09 2015 UTC,Bikelanes often run to the right of cars turning right.  I feel it's safer to pass the turning lane on the left.

Except in cases where the right kind of police officer is on the scene and motivated to act,  there are no consequences for drivers who drive and park in bike lanes, run red lights,  talk on their phones while they drive, speed, make illegal left turns,  run cyclists off the road out of spite, drive and park on sidewalks, make right turns without yielding to pedestrians,  etc. regardless of whether their plates are visible and the infractions are reported.

toronto,3dnyr8,Imactuallyinsane,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:00:59 2015 UTC,"So the reasons they wont license cyclists is because:   The difficulty in keeping a database complete and current - Come on how hard could this possibly be??   2 The difficulty in licensing children, given that they ride bikes too - Really? Just make it so that anyone under X age doesn't need a license.   Licensing in and of itself does not change the behaviour of cyclists who are disobeying traffic laws. - It's not that so people will stop breaking the laws, it's so that people can at least try to identify someone who is doing something illegal. ""I saw a red bike and the number ###"" is a lot better than: ""I saw a red bike""."
toronto,3dnyr8,scottyb83,4,Fri Jul 17 22:23:20 2015 UTC,"Yup, just what everyone needs...  More fees for our wonderful government to collect from all of us.        How about bike insurance too?  GREAT!  Hopefully the cost of said insurance lines the insurance companies pockets further!   How about rollerblades need license plates too? Tiny stickers on the heels so you can complain to the cops when a rollerblader blows through a stop sign in a residential neighbourhood when safe to do so....  Cycling is a leisurely, safe, environmentally friendly and healthy alternative to cars.       Pretty much exactly what everyone actually needs a bit more of (exercise and fun).   More taxes, fees and red tape... Not so much more needed for anyone."
toronto,3dnyr8,Imactuallyinsane,0,Sat Jul 18 01:42:41 2015 UTC,"Fees that could be put towards better infrastructure that cyclists have been asking for and honestly deserve.  Bicycles I believer are covered under home owners insurance or tenants insurance.   You are trying to make the argument ridiculous with rollerblades. They are much less prevalent, travel at much slower speed and can not cause the same lever of damage or bodily harm as a bicycle.  I agree it is all of those things but that does not take away from the face that bicycles regularly interact with cars and pedestrians, that there are laws that would be easier to enforce if there were license plates, and it MIGHT even cause the certain ""bad apple"" cyclists to stop the dangerous behaviour like running stop signs, red light, traveling the wrong way on a 1 way street or riding in the sidewalks.  I always find it amusing that something that could be so positive FOR the cycling community is always met with such resistance."

I'm happily paying heaps to own a home and drive in this city as it is, further government levies on my leisure activities is unwanted to say he least.   I agree intervention from the government is a tool for accountability...  But, where does it end?   After bikes why wouldn't skateboards, rollerblades or walking be next?    Yes licensing skateboarding could help pay for the skateparks we need however, licensing in general for our green and healthy initiatives is counter productive to what we all need to be happy and healthy.  All these problems could be faced with better driver training and rider training.   No matter what people use to get around (cars, bikes, rollerblades, feet) there will always be idiots who act like idiots.    Rather than licensing, there could simply be a media campaign to help people understand how both sides need to accommodate each other to be safe.  2 out of 4 of my bikes never touch a street (dirt trails or skateparks)  why should I license those ones?  Oh,  those are exempt?  Ok, What about the people who just ride around the the same residential neighbourhood at night for exercise under 10 times per year (my wife, scared of cars just likes the fresh air and not bother anyone).  Oh that's fine too? What about the guy who rides the paved trail system a few times a year just for fun and exercise? Oh, he's exempt too?  What about the guy who rides to work on the dedicated bike lane on Dundas because he can't afford a car or insurance...  Ok.  He pays and licenses his bike because he's a menace!         Enough with the licenses.  People just need to be informed, considerate and responsible on all sides.  Until that happens bike riders will still be the only ones getting hurt (and still riding simply because it's fun)..."

I think the benefits still outweigh the cons. I think any bike taken in a public place should have some way to identify them just like cars do.   I don't think more media stories need to happen as all they seem to do is polarize the issue like this thread has. It happens every time. I do like the idea of more training though. For both cars and cyclists, though I don't think cyclists would like the idea of any kind of mandated training as much as they seem to not want to have a license plate."

toronto,3dnyr8,danhoyuen,5,Sat Jul 18 00:48:33 2015 UTC,You are correct; nothing anybody says is ever going to make her less injured. I'm not sure I understand your point to be honest; is there one?
toronto,3dnyr8,humanefly,-4,Sat Jul 18 01:24:09 2015 UTC,"maybe there shouldn't be a discussion.  Facts were presented in court and the law has spoken.  If the driver deserves more punishment than he would have gotten more.  I wouldn't trust everything an article written by the victim says.  Maybe she WAS going too fast.  besides, IMO drivers are way more nervous beside a bike than bikers are when beside a car.  Cyclists tends be very entitled when it comes to the limited space on the road."
toronto,3dnyr8,danhoyuen,3,Sat Jul 18 01:56:27 2015 UTC,"The court purpose of the court case was simply to determine if the driver should get a ticket. If the victim wants damages she needs to file a suit; only then would there be any chance for the driver to get what he deserved. Imo cyclist aren't entitled enough; where there aren't bike lanes they should ride in the center of the lane and own the space to discourage aggressive drivers from attempting to share the lane, which is very dangerous."
toronto,3dnyr8,humanefly,-1,Sat Jul 18 01:59:13 2015 UTC,"I see a problem with a bicycle going 20 kph on a 60 kph road holding up traffic.    It's like the 5 people who lives close to work against thousands that have to commute for 45 minutes to get to work.  Make CAR safety a priority.  Why don't cyclist just go on roads that have bike lanes exclusively.  U don't see a car going off road or get on a bike lane.  This isn't as bad in Toronto, I've lived in California for 2 years.  Their roads are hilly and narrow.  You can just tell how uncomfortable everyone are when there's a bicycle on the road in sight."
toronto,3dnyr8,TorontoBob22,2,Sat Jul 18 09:25:49 2015 UTC,"I agree that a cyclist should be able to travel at close to traffic speed in order to be safe on the road. If traffic goes up to 60kph the cyclist should be capable of maintaining a steady pace of at least 45-50kph in order to cycle safely on that road; this is easily doable for short periods of time in areas that are not extremely hilly, if the cyclist is in good shape. If they aren't capable of traveling at safe speed, I agree that they should be removed from the road.  Bicycles are considered a vehicle, they have a right to be on the road and travel freely, just as much as everyone else. You have a right to be uncomfortable. Your discomfort in no way trumps the right of the cyclist to travel. In Toronto, even though we have increased bike lane coverage greatly, if cyclists were only permitted in bicycle lanes there would be no cyclists.   You seem to assume that roads are only for cars; I think that's an incorrect assumption."
toronto,3dnyr8,kovu159,-1,Sat Jul 18 16:41:23 2015 UTC,"If bicycles are considered vehicles then they should pass some safety standard, and they should need a license to operate in traffic.  All other users on the road pass some sort of performance pre-requiste.  Right now i can not tell which cyclist is seasoned, who might swirve just a little bit onto my lane.  Which one might hit that pebble on the lane and flip under my wheel. Besides, i am speaking with a personal motive: I don't want to share the road with someone who can be killed or seriously injured by any minor collision be it my fault or theirs.  (I have driven for 15 years and not even a point taken off or have been in an accident.  I am a very confident safe driver who abides to all the rules). Having them on the road just seem to introduce elements that cause accidents to happen.   Motorcycles are SAFER because they can justify taking a whole lane by keeping up to speed."
toronto,3dnyr8,booksoverboyfriends,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:15:21 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily disagree; I ride a  commute daily via motorcycle and the ability to keep up to speed does add an element of safety; when being overtaken from behind there is less of a difference in speed and so the overtaker has more time to see me and govern themselves accordingly. That being said, the higher the speed, the more likely injury or death is to occur, so while they may be safer in that accident is less likely to occur, the damage should an accident occur is likely to be greater.   All that being said, the law is the law: according to the law I believe a bicycle IS a vehicle.   I do certainly appreciate your concern,"

That's your opinion.   Again. You seem to have a habit of putting these opinions on me that I never once claimed. It's called a strawman fallacy. You've essentially created a caricature of yourself, pretended it's me, and are criticizing that. It's a really weak way of feeling superior or as if you are making good points. So I hope you understand it when I say you make yourself come off as a huge idiot. I know you won't accept it, but I feel a bit of relief believing I'm not the first or last person in your life that will call you an idiot and be justified saying it.  The reality is selling someone's car is the stupidest way of lessening the chances for a repeat offense. Do you really think there's little chance someone whose car was taken and sold won't buy another? Toronto is a commuter city - it's not easy to get around without transportation and most will avoid public transit when possible.   My only contention is with the concept of forfeiture of civil property - it's a slippery slope, and one that has led to horrible outcomes in the US. There was a case in the US where police took a farmer's 15k$ (and kept it) on the grounds of ""suspicion"", despite the fact that he was just on the way to buy a tractor. The officers made a bogus claim of suspicion to take his money for themselves/their department.   I hope you can understand how easily civil forfeiture can be abused, or at least how poor of a punishment it is to ""lessen the chances of a repeat offense"". Anyway, nice knowing you."

That said, it's unlikely to make a significant dent the number low-value question threads: The disclaimer we already have before submitting seems to have had negligible impact on posting behaviour.

We also run the risk of people ignoring it entirely if we make it too detailed.  Having AutoModerator detect and nuke some common questions by default and point people to FAQ pages and /r/askto is probably the most failsafe solution. It might just also happen to be the most controversial. I'll dry-run some filters next week and see how realistic it even is.

This is the problem with this sub, not the posts.   How would someone who isn't regularily here or from the city know what is a common question? And most people don't care - they give answers anyway, despite the post itself being downvoted.  First step should be some basic description at the top of the sidebar of what is okay as a post - then you'll at least have something to justify doing something about the downvoters who seem to think of this as their own private sub."

By all accounts, fatal shots were fired in mere seconds, which is not enough time to even attempt any de-escalation methods. If this video shows Loku was advancing in a threatening manner then why not release it? Or perhaps it shows Loku barely able to respond (as the eye witness described) and a trigger happy cop."

My brother is autistic and he knows damn well you can't bring a hammer to settle a dispute. If he did, it would be because he made a shitty choice - just like everyone else is capable of doing    Like you said, your brother has a level of autism that allows him to do that, but that doesn't mean everyone with autism (which you acknowledge has varying levels of severity) is necessarily capable of doing that.   You can also replace ""autism"" with someone suffering from a neurodegenerative disorder like Parkinson's or MS.  If they don't respond fast enough to the cop's instruction, should they be held to the same response level as someone with full control of their body?    Mind you, in no way am I excusing any violent behaviour that may occur; I'm not saying people with autism should be allowed causing harm.  Mental diseases is a complicated issue that needs to be carefully assessed.  Situations involving people suffering from mental diseases should be approached thoughtfully and not be a quick hair trigger scenario where one shoots first and asks questions later.  Based on all accounts so far, the actual face to face interaction between Loku and the cops was a mere seconds which gave no opportunity for the cops to de-escalate the situation to do - which is exactly what they were instructed to do after the fatal shooting of Yatim at the hands of police.   Just like the public would be outraged if someone with a physical handicap (ex wheelchair) was fatally gunned down in seconds, we should similarly be concerned with the disturbing pattern between police and the mentally ill."

Anyone without a gun would need to calmly talk to the guy with a hammer, ask him to drop it if they felt unsafe, or at least have a conversation to determine if he intended to use the hammer in that moment to assault the cops. Instead of even trying to end the situation without anyone dying, the natural reaction of a cop is to immediately murder a person if they present even the slightest possibility of a future threat and especially if the murder could be justified after the fact (""he had a weapon...""). If the cops were truly looking to only kill people as a last resort, this person would still be alive. Instead it appears that they are looking to kill people in every case where it can be even remotely justified. Not the standard that should be applied if they had any courage.

toronto,3drjje,NewAlienBlueSnoo,11,Sat Jul 18 20:32:44 2015 UTC,"I would hazard to say that it's a 1oz drink unless you get a double, in which case the amount of lemon vodka would just be doubled, because the blue curacao alcohol content is pretty negligible in this drink.  ""Citrus"" in this case is likely just bar-sour. Which is a pre-made sour mix they keep in a jug behind the bar. Some places use lemon and lime in sour mix, some have separate lime and lemon jugs for specific drinks.   You can make bar sour like this:  2 parts water 2 parts sugar 2 parts lemon juice 1 part lime juice   You boil the water and sugar just until it's dissolved. Don't reduce it, you don't need it any thicker. Let it cool, then add the lemon and lime juices, shake it to mix, and then you can store it in a fridge, it'll keep for weeks.  If you use 1cup of water/lemon/sugar here, it will yield about 3 cups of sour, which is good for anywhere from 10-20 cocktails depending on how you mix them.  I've not had this drink, but if you didn't detect any lime in the flavour, replace the lime juice with lemon juice in the bar sour and try that.  At it's core, this drink is basically just a white cosmopolitan, with the triple sec being replaced by the blue curacao ""lava"", so start with something like this for a base:  1oz lemon vodka 2oz white cranberry juice 1oz bar sour    Put some ice in an 8oz wine glass, shake the 3 above ingredients in a shaker w/ice, and then strain over the glass.  For the ""lava"" part, in a small glass measuring cup (with a pouring spout), mix:  1/2oz blue curacao 1/2oz grenadine 1/1oz cranberry juice   Stir that together, and then pour it slowly into the drink. Now, the trick to this is to use a spoon to diffuse and direct the stream towards the side of the glass, otherwise you'll end up with all the ""lava"" of the lava lamp in the middle and on the bottom of the glass.  Just put the spoon against the inside of the glass, and pour onto the spoon, take the soon away just before you finish pouring and you should get the effect you're looking for, experiment and have some fun with it.  If you're finding that you're not able to get the desired effect, try adding a little more grenadine or a little less blue curacao to change the viscosity of the lava, which will change how it is suspended in the drink.  For the wedding, the best bet would be to make a few gallons of sour mix ahead of time, and then once you have the right ratio for the ""lava"", pre mix a few bottles of that as well, with bottle spouts. Then these cocktails can be whipped together en masse quickly and easily for the tables.  Remember that pretty much every ""unique"" cocktail you see at a place like jack astors/BP/etc are all based off of some kind of already existing cocktail. When you want to figure out how to make something, look at the ingredients, and then find what other classic cocktail already exists using nearly the same ingredients, and then start from there. Most cocktail recipe books actually have an appendix at the back, listing ingredients alphabetically and the cocktails that use them for just this purpose.

In my car I can control the temperature, listen to music, have plenty of storage space, and can talk freely (with hand's free devices of course).

I think this is inherently poor design, and our transit infrastructure has not been kept up to speed.  Take a look at high density urban populations around the world and you'll find that mass transit is not only effective but quick and comfortable.  Also the fuel inefficiencies of vehicles are ok but they're nearly insignificant compared to the movements of mass transit vehicles."

OK, maybe you live in a place where you need a car to get around because you're physically disabled and public transit is underdeveloped, or because you're in a shitty place that was designed for cars instead of humans. In those cases I get it. But in any case, relying on non-renewable fossil fuels is insane in the long term.

Cheers"
toronto,3dn9kl,JackSmackus,9,Fri Jul 17 20:12:38 2015 UTC,"I am arguing that these lanes don't make people car pool. People that use them I suspect would have the same number of people in their whether the HOV lane existed or not. If these things worked they would be jamed with cars filled to with people and we wouldn't have any traffic issues but instead ultimatetly what they are acomplishing is reducing already busy roads with less lanes. Sure lets do things about traffic but HOV lanes are not the solution, they don't work, clearly. There other things that would greatly improve traffic flow and reducing traffic but that's another topic. In regards to one of your questions I have tried car pooling and it's great if you have some shift job were everyone works the same hours, I don't and almost everyone I know doesn't. I work for a major corporation and everyone day is different due to their work loads, schedules, projects. I see people at work try to car pool and it never lasts no one shares the same schedule unless they have a really simple job which is not common now a days. It's a wonderful concept but just doesn't correlate to most peoples lives, unfortunately."
toronto,3dn9kl,ieGod,4,Fri Jul 17 20:38:24 2015 UTC,"It can correlate if it becomes burdensome enough, and if the lanes stayed I bet people would find ways to make it work.  The one thing that doesn't work to ease traffic congestion is increasing the number of lanes. This has only shown time and time again that it increases incentives for people to drive. So what happens is more cars get on the roads and congestion reaches previous levels anyway. It's a lose lose proposition.   I've noticed more people carpooling at my work as a result, and I gotta say I'm more impressed than I thought I'd be. I like them. I think they should stay."
toronto,3dn9kl,4ray,2,Fri Jul 17 21:28:57 2015 UTC,"doesn't work to ease traffic congestion is increasing the number of lanes   It works if you restrict access with methods such as ramp metering, that ultimately discourages people from even entering the highway when volume is too high.

We've had these in my area for a few years now and they've added them to more on-ramps and they really do seem to help.  I think there should also be tolls, though, I think tolls would be far more efficient than HOV lanes as you don't end up with an underutilized lane, and disincentivizes even the people who are okay sitting in traffic.  It's also just way more flexible as you can more easily adjust tolls than add/remove HOV lanes. And the revenue can go to public transit, which would further improve the situation."

toronto,3dn9kl,Silicon_Hydra,5,Sat Jul 18 16:44:23 2015 UTC,I'm all for HOV lanes. But I think it should be two people not three. This would still for pairs to meet up and drive to work downtown.  It would be really amazing if there were three lanes plus one HOV. But I think I'm in dreamland.

toronto,3dn9kl,talktank,8,Fri Jul 17 22:50:17 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that there's still a benefit when a cab with one passenger uses this resource, because it still saves on others involved in car culture, such as parking space. It's bigger than just saving space on the highway, which is a singularly purposed public resource that can't really be changed, but if there were less cars in need of parking once the people reached their downtown destination we would have less of a fight when it came to repurposing parts of the road for public transit and bike lanes."

toronto,3dmrc2,brycebryce54,4,Fri Jul 17 17:46:33 2015 UTC,"I've had a cat or two wander off before(once in Parkdale, too!), but they always come back.  Every time it happens, they find somewhere they can hide for most of the day and then they come out looking for food or a way home when it's late at night(2-4am) and there's a lot less noise and movement from people and traffic.  If she's a semi-outdoor cat, it could mean that she's not very used to loud, unfamiliar noises/people/smells/etc. so it would make sense for her to hide until it's quieter and she can explore.  Also, if you haven't put her picture up in the Parkdale Animal Hospital(Queen/Triller) and any other vet in the area, should go do that ASAP.  If you're in one of those low-rise apartment buildings (like on King, closer to Roncesvalles) and Penny's wandered down the fire escape or something, check your bins.  That's where I found my cat after getting sightings all over the neighbourhood.  And, this could be important, make sure you brave the smells and move some bins around.  My cat was staring at me from behind a row of stank-ass garbage bins while I called his name for 30 seconds before just moving the bins and picking him up(carefully-- if they don't come when you call, they could be injured-- my cat was just scared and stinky, haha!).  If you're in a house, put out some food or the litter box and just hang out on your steps or deck or wherever for the night.  Don't make noise, just chill somewhere nearby so if Penny comes back, you can call to her.  And if you've got a deck or whatever, make sure you check under it.  Like before, she could just be hiding and very quiet because she's out of her element.  The good news is, Parkdaleans are awesome people to lose your cat around.  When mine got out in the middle of the night, we spent the entire next day from 9am til 12:30am wandering around shaking cat toys and showing his photo to people.  While a lot of people hadn't seen him, EVERY person was willing to look at the pic and then offer some sort of encouragement or advice on where to look.  When my cat got out in the Bloor West Village, all I got were people who pretended they didn't see you(like I was asking them for change or something) and angry old people who think you're selling them something.  Made me regret moving out of Parkdale, let me tell ya.  Penny will reappear!  Just gotta pull a stakeout or three.  :-)"

One of the gentlemen in our group recounted for us his latest interview which happened to be with Mr Hakimi for a senior management position.  He said it was a strange interview from the start but then Mr Hakimi asked the gentleman for his age.  The gentleman's response was to ask how his age was relevant to their conversation, and Mr Hakimi's answer was (I'm paraphrasing here) ""well, you know, you look like you're in your sixties, which means you'll probably retire in a couple of years and I'll have to hire someone again, so thanks for your time"" and then waved the gentleman out of his office."

My advice is to look at the debit card and call the issuing bank. You can almost certainly mail the entire wallet to them."

All it takes is a driver's licence and/or a social insurance card to do a lot of damage in this country. You could turn it in and tell this person to go through the police to claim it.
toronto,3dn2r5,RoosterCheese,3,Fri Jul 17 19:08:19 2015 UTC,You make a good point. But please rest assured I will thoroughly check it is the correct person before handing it over. The police leave a little to be desired when it comes to lost property in London...

toronto,3do7ql,dkwangchuck,27,Fri Jul 17 22:11:40 2015 UTC,"I like Alan Cross a lot, and I think he's coming at this from a good place. He said something impolite about someone with a huge social media following, and he got burned for it. I don't think he meant any harm.  I will say, as someone who knows very little about Kim Kardashian (or any of the other Kardashians --I believe there are also several Jenners beyond Bruce/Caitlyn as well in the mix?) but to my understanding she became famous based on the success of a sex tape and has done much to raise her profile over the years since by leveraging her sexuality (i.e. trying to 'Break the Internet' with pictures of her butt). From my admittedly limited understanding of her fame, she's a nouveau riche Snooki who has stayed relevant by always being in the public eye. Her fame is her accomplishment, and building her fame is her greatest talent.   Now I'm not saying Alan should have called her what he called her --and it sounds like he realized his mistake fairly quickly as well-- but it's not like he went way out into left field to dismiss her. This is not that weird or unlikely of an insult given who he is talking about. It is an insult, an unkind one, but it's not like he's saying this of Natalie Portman, Condoleezza Rice, Alison Janney, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Alanis Morissette, or another woman of accomplishment and standing who have a lot of admirable and inspirational qualities. Hell, I would be more upset if he'd said it of Pam Anderson than Kim Kardashian: Pam's career is a long and storied one that definitely leveraged her sexuality, but there's a lot of substance to her activities and views -including the ones I disagree with-- that make the insult he chose to use too dismissive of her achievements.  He said something stupid, but how much of this rage is about the word he used being unacceptable to use ever, to anyone? Because the last I heard, skank wasn't even a curse word. Rude, yes. Totally unacceptable? C'mon."
toronto,3do7ql,gammadeltat,24,Fri Jul 17 22:54:59 2015 UTC,"but to my understanding she became famous based on the success of a sex tape and has done much to raise her profile over the years since by leveraging her sexuality (i.e. trying to 'Break the Internet' with pictures of her butt).   Actually... It's speculated that her mother sold the sex tape so that her daughter would get famous, which was then turned into a reality tv show... So... Calling her a skank is, y'know, kind of fucking on the ball given that a skank is a sleazy or unpleasant person... I'd say Kim is sleazy as all fuck, both her and her mother.  And fuck it, Alan called it like it was. He felt his mistake was name calling, I feel his mistake was saying something that her fans and the fucking PC culture would lap up and go fucking apeshit with, which is exactly what happened.  I agree completely with what you're laying down, to use it on someone like Pam Anderson is wrong, Pam didn't market herself and plot her way into the public eye, she started doing Playboy shoots (Which, lets be fucking honest, are tame as all hell), did some other porn, moved to TV, moved to completely acceptable TV, tries to be a voice for things she's passionate about (Which is always dangerous because rarely are people passionate about really simple things), and seems like, overall, just a good and honest person who appears, to me, very sincere in her public persona... Kim rocketed to fame by the production and sale/leak of a sex video that spiraled into a reality tv show months later, all because she was friends with Paris Hilton and went ""Hey, I'm rich and pretty, I want to be famous like her!"". I don't think she has any redeeming quality beyond being rich and a fucking time-sink for people that look up to those kinds of people.  Edit: I used Pam only because I could, I don't necessarily agree or follow any of her social causes or life, I just know of her and I respect her for her commitment to her personal views, causes, and how she generally seems like a sincere and kind person."
toronto,3do7ql,DonJulioTO,11,Fri Jul 17 23:46:26 2015 UTC,"I think part of the issue is that using the word ""skank"" legitimizes the notion that it's okay to judge a woman solely on her sexuality. In your reply, the only other people you talk about are women.     Can you think of any men that get similar treatment?  Any guys who people suggest it's okay to dismiss because they own their sexuality? Most of the examples I can think of are there because there's a hint of ambiguous to them, like Adam Lambert or metrosexuals as a group.      There probably are some examples of it happening.  Fabio, I guess is an example - lol.  But wouldn't you agree that this is an issue that's much more prevalent for women?  That as a society, a woman's sexuality impacts how we see them much more than for men."

I'm not talking about lying or using force or coercion.  I'm talking about men who study social dynamics to their own advantage and have no intention of committment.  I'm talking about men who have decided that the the lifestyle that suits them is one where they bed as many women as they please.    Like it or not, that's an example of a man ""owning"" his sexuality, and the mainstream absolutely hates it.  Matter of fact, what they will usually call him is a LOSER.  Why?  Because men in our society tend to be judged disproportionately based on their level of success."

toronto,3dn2ds,TheOGHercules,2,Fri Jul 17 19:51:33 2015 UTC,Probably because the UPX isn't aimed at Toronto residents and if you're only visiting the city once why would you bother getting a card you can't use anywhere else? But otherwise the card is available for anyone who really needs it!
toronto,3dn2ds,Alwayscheyenne,2,Fri Jul 17 21:17:18 2015 UTC,Other cities only allow getting on and off transit with a card. As an example in London everyone must pay with an Oyster card or tap their credit card when boarding transit and when getting off trains/subways. In 2017 everyone will be forced to use a Presto card or a credit card to use transit in Toronto as tokens will be gone. We need to move forward getting a card is not a big deal.

toronto,3dn2ds,AwesomeNameGenerator,18,Fri Jul 17 18:36:26 2015 UTC,"What’s so disappointing about these figures is that the airport is one of the busiest employment and transit hubs in the country, with 36 million visitors and 40,000 workers.  Air Canada flight attendant, Joyce Nakanishi, is one of those workers. “We’ve got these virtually empty trains running back and forth, while at the same time us airport workers and the thousands of residents who live in Toronto’s west end, are still stuck in traffic or packed like sardines on the chronically underfunded and overcrowded TTC,” she said.   A UP Express ticket from Union to the airport costs $10.00 one way for employees of the airport. The train runs every 15 minutes and takes 25 minutes to get to the airport.   This is a pretty reasonable rate, so I don't understand the complaints from the employee in the article. Given this information, I'm also surprised that more employees don't use the train. Maybe they don't live close to the stations?   Edit: For some context, I think the price is reasonable as a one way GO train ticket from Union to Oshawa is $10.25 and there are plenty of people who take the train instead of driving."

I don't own a car and when I did I was paying about the same to have a car...or more actually. It was a gas guzzler!  Part of the problem is that the TTC still doesn't have fare integration with other systems either. So my GO pass was $320, my Mississauga Transit GO sticker was $60 (I would get off at Clarkson and take a MiWay bus to Winston Churchill...technically the hospital was in Oakville!). And then add $120 for my metro pass on top of that! (It was $120 at the time...).  Total trip took 2 hours each way so that wasn't awesome, and at least 1 of those hours would be waiting for the next GO train! The buses and trains didn't sync up...ARRRRRGH. Nowadays it would be way less stressful and I can make the same trip in about 45 minutes on average! Also in the summer I would just ride the bike! That took 2 hours too and was free! Best shape of my life for a few summers there! :)  So long story short: I'm not shocked at the cost..."

Using the CAA Driving Cost Calculator and selecting a compact car, the cost of driving comes out to $0.46 per kilometre.   Union to Pearson is 27 KM, one way.  27 X $0.46 = $12.42  Again, not sure how accurate that is, but if it is right then the UP Express rate is  bargain compared to driving."

In addition to the cost savings, I won't have to worry about traffic.   I've only taken the TTC from the airport once. I didn't find the experience to be enjoyable so I wont be doing it again.

toronto,3dn2ds,zap_pow_bang,7,Fri Jul 17 17:47:21 2015 UTC,"$19 is still too high to be honest. $15 is about the limit of reasonability for that service, and it should at least be similar to Vancouver or Montreal's airport service, where you get the rides included in the cost of a monthly pass.

Maybe because their job depends on them being able to get there?   And in any case, my real point is that the UPX should form part of the TTC network and should cost TTC prices, ideally speaking. Public transit is not meant to be profitable, it's supposed to be effective and priced so that as many people as possible can afford it.  I know that sometimes isn't realistic but it's just crazy to me that $27 is the non-Presto fare and $19 is the best they could do for the poor schmucks who already shell out so much money for transit in Toronto."
toronto,3dn2ds,zap_pow_bang,2,Fri Jul 17 19:23:29 2015 UTC,Maybe because their job depends on them being able to get there?    How is that different from every other person's job anywhere?
toronto,3dn2ds,Biuku,3,Sat Jul 18 11:11:33 2015 UTC,Maybe because their job depends on them being able to get there?   They were able to get there before the UPX. They're still able to get there. It's not like the TTC or the GO stopped their service to the airport.   I agree that in an ideal world it would be great for it to be integrated with the TTC.
toronto,3dn2ds,DetectivePunch,3,Fri Jul 17 19:32:16 2015 UTC,"If you're on a business trip -- which is really the backbone of air travel -- $19 is basically zero.  99% of people flying out of Pearson have purchased a luxury, or are travelling for work. I mean, if parking at the Royal York is $50, too bad -- don't go to the Royal York. If spending $600 to go to Vancouver is work it ... how is $19 suddenly an issue?"
toronto,3dn2ds,Born_Ruff,2,Sat Jul 18 01:00:49 2015 UTC,"Sure, then time becomes the factor. If money isn't an issue and you're staying right at union great. If you're staying even as close as university and dundas you need to take another cab from union. At that point a cab door to door, even in traffic, isn't going to be that much slower than the UP plus getting a cab from union.   If it were cheap, I'd bet even people who don't care about money would care about the value."
toronto,3dn2ds,robbie9000,2,Sat Jul 18 13:03:21 2015 UTC,This feels like the main fallacy of the whole business model. The people who don't care about price are the people who are just going to get a limo for door to door service.
toronto,3dn2ds,udunehommik,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:22:23 2015 UTC,"The Canada Line in Vancouver isn't comparable to the UPX though. In Vancouver, it's an RT system based on the ICTS technology used by the Scarborough RT, making frequent stops as part of a metro light rail line. UPX is a mainline railway service that doesn't have any equivalent in Canada that I know of.  Yes, we should totally have a metro style connection to the airport like Phase 2 of the Eglinton LRT is supposed to deliver, or that the Etobicoke RT was planned to, but we don't and we shouldn't be comparing the UPX to LRTs or subways."

It will take a few months or years before the fact of this train is entrenched within traveldom.

The train is not validated until they hear of positive experiences from 2-3 friends. Then it will be popular for them, and they will pass on the travel tips when away on business.

However, the Toronto Municipal Code reads:  ""A member who voted with the prevailing side on a matter may make a notice of motion or a motion without notice in accordance with the procedures by-law to reopen the matter:   (1) With the consent of two-thirds of all members present if he or she makes the notice of motion or motion without notice:   (a) Less than twelve months after Council or a committee decided the matter; and  (b) If no regular election has occurred since the decision. ""  I'm pretty sure the SSE vote came more than 12 months after the previous vote. It would appear that nothing illegal has happened here (according to the quoted section of the Municipal Code). But I'm not an expert, and I'd like to think that the Star's reporters, who are more experienced than I am, did their research correctly."

Breaches like this are dealt with by council itself (vote of censure, etc.) or at most the integrity commissioner.   And in this case, it seems like the whole thing is a moot point: the issue is whether the vote should have counted as reopening the previous debate (in which case it needed a 2/3 majority) or not.

He'll have to live the rest of his life with that mental weight on his shoulders.   Does the public really deserve to know this guys identity just to satisfy our twisted curiosity with those unfortunate events. The police and the crown have cleared him of wrong doing, a clear cut case of self defense. We have to have faith in our judicial institutions, or at least accept the decisions they make, even if you don't like them. You either support the rule of law or you don't.

We're talking about people never charged or in some cases even accused of crimes. Yet the police were adamant they had done nothing wrong in blabbing about being dispatched to handle John Doe's suicide call when his prospective employer came knocking.   And yet here, they're clamming up about a killer and refusing to state the basis upon which they are refusing to lay charges. In most civilized societies, the taking of a life is subject to an accounting in a court of law for the purpose of delivering justice to the public.

When your neighbourhood was built in the 60's-80's before these boxes were invented and home delivery was common there isn't much to be planned for.

toronto,3dnlqz,KangFu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:39:44 2015 UTC,"No but every large city has seen improvements in infrastructure.  Cutting home delivery is not the problem, the problem is the dramatically decreasing mail volumes because better options exist. You have entire generations who have never sent or received a hand written letter because a call, text or email can be done instantaneously.  This year the government is discontinuing physical cheques, everything will be direct deposit.  Similar to other historically irrelevant services, letter-mail delivery will be a niche service within 30 years. Parcel delivery is the future. I have more interest in a milk delivery then I do in lettermail delivery.   Lets not pretend that the USPS doesn't have problems because its expected to be broke again in 3 years. I am not in favor subsidizing a service that is barely used by a large portion of the population.

The box will be in a common sense location (perhaps even where a mailbox already is) and, well, they'll have the right to put it where they put it anyways. It's a transition that has to happen and for most folks this won't be a big one.  What kinda concerns me, though, is the impact for people with mobility problems. It will definitely be a transition. I had a peek at their website and none of the solutions they listed included home delivery, so at the end of the day, someone (a friend, neighbor, or somehow the resident) will need to go to the box.  Or whoever delivers will need to pony up for a different carrier."

toronto,3dmimv,otbflo,9,Fri Jul 17 19:03:00 2015 UTC,"Who dictates whats green and what isnt? a Diesel VW golf, isnt. but a prius is?  Lithium is strip mined in bolivia, shipped to china battery gets made, battery shipped to US, installed into a prius, then shipped around the world.   There are so many things wrong with that statement, I don't even know where to begin...  Firstly, lithium isn't strip mined.  It's pumped as a brine out of certain lakes, and left to dry before being deboronated and purified.  The production of materials for electric car batteries only accounts for 2.3% of an electric car's overall environmental impact (environmental impact in this case being defined in terms of a standardized index measuring harm to human health, ecosystem diversity loss, and resource quality loss), with the battery's full lifecycle making up only 15% of an electric car's full lifecycle environmental impact.  Conventional hybrids use much smaller batteries, so the environmental impact of battery manufacturing for them is even smaller.  Secondly, the standard Prius doesn't even use lithium in the first place.  It uses nickel-metal hydride, a chemistry which is both well-known, and easily recyclable.  Thirdly, shipping does not significantly contribute to the Prius' lifecycle environmental impact, because it is the world's most efficient form of transport, able to realize efficiencies of upwards of 1,000 miles per gallon per ton.  For scale, you can ship a completed Prius from Japan to North America using less than 10 gallons of fuel.  Put the environmental impact of shipping into context with the car's full lifecycle emissions and energy use, and you'll see that the contribution of shipping to the environmental impact of the Prius' lifecycle is utterly negligible.  Finally, other lifecycle analyses show that hybrids are, in fact, better for the environment than diesel cars.  This is because the overwhelming majority of any car's environmental impact, hybrid or diesel, is incurred in operations, not manufacturing, the Prius gets better fuel economy than the Golf TDI (fuelly's aggregate data for the Golf TDI and the Prius yields a consistent conclusion), and the greater energy density of diesel is countered in part by its greater emissions per gallon.   No matter how you cut it, if you wish to argue that diesels deserve to have HOV lane access, conventional hybrids have a superior case for the same.  And currently, conventional hybrids don't have HOV lane access.  P.S. Please do not attempt to demonize hybrids by casting them as cars exclusively for the rich.  The diesel Golf TDI starts at $23,095, while the Prius's price is quite comparable at $26,305.  In fact, the Prius C is actually cheaper than the Golf TDI, at $21,055."
toronto,3dmimv,disembodied_voice,-1,Fri Jul 17 22:52:16 2015 UTC,"Yes nimh. Forgot. I'm not demonizing hybrids. I'm just not happy that people get rewarded for having them. And others get punished for not having them. also Ontario electricity comes mostly from coal nuclear and hydro. Only one is""green"". I'm all for saving the world and saving money and all that but I just think its b.s. everyone pays taxes for the roads. We should share the roads equally. Hard to argue that.  The city province and country should invest in proper transit. Not a stupid train to the airport or lrts. A proper subway that stretches far and wide.  Its easily the most efficient transportation method. And with less traffic every vehicle will save fuel."
toronto,3dmimv,otbflo,6,Sat Jul 18 00:38:36 2015 UTC,"Ontario electricity comes mostly from coal nuclear and hydro. Only one is""green""   If you're talking about regular hybrids like the Prius, this point is wholly irrelevant because they do not plug into the grid at all.  If you're talking about plug-in hybrids or electric cars, this point is still wholly irrelevant because there isn't a single coal-fired plant left in Ontario, and nuclear power carries with it a far lower CO2 per kWh rating than do coal or natural gas.    All told, Ontario's grid produces just under 100 grams of CO2 per kWh.  Given that a Leaf can go about 3.3 miles/5 km per kWh, while a Corolla emits 351 grams of CO2 per mile/219 gm CO2 per km, the electric car ends up being 90% less polluting than a Corolla in Ontario.   And with less traffic every vehicle will save fuel.   There's more than one way to save fuel.  Encouraging adoption of plug-in hybrids and electric cars is one of them (and we've already decided the environmental benefits of ownership of common hybrids like the Prius is insufficient to justify rewarding with single driver HOV lane access).  Besides, incentivizing environmentally friendly transport and building subways are not mutually exclusive."
toronto,3dmimv,disembodied_voice,0,Sat Jul 18 02:19:28 2015 UTC,"Nuclear power pollutes in so look many other ways. And I feel its dangerous. Natural gas, might be worse than coal. Fracking and refracking are killing the environment in more ways than releasing co2. And they release a lot of co2.  A hybrid isn't green. Plug or not. Diesel isn't gas isn't. Air powered car might be. And in some ways svo/wvo is a green vehicle(carbon negative maybe) but yeah if a prius c costs  24k and a yaris costs 17k. That's 7k of gas right there. Same chassis no? Furthermore you have to work to get the money to pay the extra 7k. That's more pollution. Driving to work, etc. Also check insurance, that will be more too unless they have a hybrid discount. Will still prolly be more than another car. You make great points about hybrids and their ecological benefits. There is always another side though. But the government (especially toronto) making major traffic decisions annoys me, I think we can all agree they are clueless when it comes to solving gridlock in toronto. More fuel efficient vehicles are coming regardless of hov lanes. Direct injection, low pressure turbos, lrr tires, composites, airless tires, all here or coming soon. Carpooling apps are helping too."
toronto,3dmimv,otbflo,6,Sat Jul 18 03:22:09 2015 UTC,"Nuclear power pollutes in so look many other ways. And I feel its dangerous. Natural gas, might be worse than coal.    You know what?  I agree.  CO2 isn't the only metric of environmental impact there is.  So let's go with a standardized index of ecosystem diversity loss, harm to human health, and resource quality loss, the EcoIndicator 99 benchmark I referenced in Notter et al and Gerkens et al in my first post.  Measure the environmental impact of different sources of electricity by this metric, and you will find that nuclear power has a much lower per kWh environmental impact than coal or natural gas, comparable to the median impact of wind, and the lower end impact of solar power.  Still not satisfied?  Let's go with deaths per terawatt-hour.  As you can see, nuclear power has the lowest deaths per TWh rating of any source of electricity, even hydroelectricity (even if you exclude the Banqiao dam disaster of 1975).  There's no way around it - no matter how you measure environmental impact, nuclear power is far superior to oil and natural gas.  Unless you have another metric, a superior metric which shows otherwise, in which case I would welcome you to present it.  Mind you, I have no particular interest in contesting your other points.  My sole interest in all this is to stop the perpetuation of dated misinformation that suggests hybrids and electric cars are actually worse for the environment than normal cars."

toronto,3dmimv,permareddit,4,Fri Jul 17 19:55:29 2015 UTC,"No, diesels are one of the most efficient vehicles on the road, not the cleanest. They are actually quite ""dirty"" in comparison to gas engines. Sulphur and other pollutants are present in much greater concentration than they are in Gasoline, atlhough this was much more of a problem 20 years ago, regulations have been amped up, but Gas is still much more refined than modern diesel still. (Why you can use gas to clean parts, but can't with diesel)  But this is exactly why it is more efficient. Diesel does not require nearly as much refining as gasoline, and is not nearly as explosive. The less explosiveness leads to a higher ignition point and also means that a spark plug is useless. High temperature and pressure are better, and in turn more a uniform explosion is had when it does ignite.  Not trying to cause an arguement just want to put some more info on diesels out there. Every technology has it's down sides, I agree with you guys, the diesel engine is BY-FAR the most efficient option in terms of energy generation. But even though it does use much less fuel than gas, there is marginally more pollution per unit of fuel burned."

toronto,3dmimv,nummeh,15,Fri Jul 17 19:57:33 2015 UTC,"If less people using a specific roadway is your idea of improving it, I guess it works. Commute times are up, and that roadway is more dangerous, and moving more slowly for 95% of the users."
toronto,3dmimv,boxjohn,16,Fri Jul 17 15:10:23 2015 UTC,95% of cars (a vast over estimation) does not represent 95% of users. Buses and 3 person carpools have more people in them - more users - and their offsetting increase in efficiency probably makes this all a wash at worst in the long run.
toronto,3dmimv,ev3to,6,Fri Jul 17 16:17:19 2015 UTC,I'd like to see some stats. As someone who drives the Gardiner daily I stand by my estimate. I've seen whole minutes go by when the HOV is empty while the other two are bumper to bumper. Takes a lot of buses to offset that.
toronto,3dmimv,boxjohn,4,Fri Jul 17 16:34:13 2015 UTC,"Not comprehensive, but Here you go"
toronto,3dmimv,ev3to,4,Fri Jul 17 16:37:02 2015 UTC,"How many busses around the city do you see running full, 24/7?  How many are booting it down Finch in the morning, one after another after another after another (experience talking here), completely empty?  That little bit of propaganda would work only if only busses prowled the streets of the city."
toronto,3dmimv,woodenboatguy,4,Fri Jul 17 18:29:31 2015 UTC,"That's not really relevant since at those times, there aren't any cars either.  The fact of the matter is there are at-capacity bus routes from 9-9, and bus usage 24/7. All those people would otherwise be cars - the same applies for subways and streetcars."
toronto,3dmimv,mattattaxx,0,Fri Jul 17 19:53:25 2015 UTC,Well I guess if data from the US Department of Transportation isn't relevant (see below) then I guess I must concede the discussion in your favour.  Congrats.

toronto,3dmimv,woodenboatguy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:59:52 2015 UTC,"The point of traffic being stuck while the HOV is empty is to encourage mass transportation and carpooling though.  The article you linked to below (source) states that US buses tend to have 9.2 passengers on average, which would certainly offset a sizable amount of vehicles, especially in rush hour when those buses become full."
toronto,3dmimv,mattattaxx,-3,Fri Jul 17 20:28:03 2015 UTC,That's not a stat on the ratio of HOV to single occupancy of the Gardiner. It also presumes a full bus. Most cars in the hov lanes are not full buses. Maybe 1 in 15 are buses at all.
toronto,3dmimv,boxjohn,2,Fri Jul 17 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"One thing that seems to getting missed is that the hov lane has limited traffic to the governed speed of transports, either 105 or 110.  All non hov traffic is now stuck with the trucks or risk a fine passing them in the hov lane."
toronto,3dmimv,Shadowkiller90210,2,Fri Jul 17 18:52:33 2015 UTC,Buses run virtually empty in comparison to the average four passenger car.  They're no panacea to improving congestion and are belching out a horrendous amount of carbon per rider over the duration of the day they're out on the road.
toronto,3dmimv,woodenboatguy,4,Fri Jul 17 18:27:52 2015 UTC,The average four passenger car averages maybe 1.1 passengers in it over the course of its driven life. Even if a bus is only being used at 20% of its capacity that's still 14 people in it.  So lets compare a 2.0L 4 cylinder car with 1 person in it: that's 2.0L of displacement and 4 cylinders per person.  A bus with an 8.9L 6 cylinder engine divided between 14 passengers (let alone including the driver): that's 0.64L of displacement and 0.43 cylinders per passenger.  I wonder which is more efficient?
toronto,3dmimv,ev3to,0,Fri Jul 17 18:43:16 2015 UTC,"You greatly exaggerate the efficiency of the bus passenger load.  And, you helpfully skipped distance per passenger which is the bus-killer when it comes to efficiency.  The bus prowls the streets primarily empty and never stops its rounds.  The car stops once it gets to its destination."
toronto,3dmimv,woodenboatguy,3,Fri Jul 17 18:48:34 2015 UTC,"A bus (and we're excluding Hybrid buses here which are more efficient) typically only needs 4 or 5 passengers for it to be more efficient than a single occupancy car.  Even if they run empty half the time, when they're running with more than 4 or 5 passengers then they're offsetting the time that they run empty.  With a few exception, they are more efficient than cars."
toronto,3dmimv,ev3to,0,Fri Jul 17 19:22:22 2015 UTC,"Not so, in reality.  But, I'm sure you can get studies that advocate in the opposite direction too."

toronto,3dmimv,woodenboatguy,10,Sat Jul 18 00:45:23 2015 UTC,The HOV lanes on the 401 are not needed and are causing traffic to go much slower than usual.  The problem? There are a lot of people stuck behind trucks in the express unable to pass because the passing lane has been turned into the HOV lane. The 401 HOV lane itself moves slower than it did as a regular passing lane.  At least that's what I've observed during my commutes on the east end of the 401 since this HOV mess was added.
toronto,3dmimv,Ceridith,9,Fri Jul 17 14:57:45 2015 UTC,"Trucks were supposed to use the 407, which is why it was paved in concrete rather than asphalt. Ban them from the express lanes or force the 407 consortium to lower the price for trucks."
toronto,3dmimv,ev3to,11,Fri Jul 17 16:18:25 2015 UTC,"I don't find that going at 100km/h rather than 120km/h is the issue. The issue is the jam-up that is caused by the idiots who sit bumper to bumper behind a truck, and then start a game of stop light tag that turns into stop and go traffic.  But going 100km/h itself? Not the issue. People just need to learn to drive smoothly."
toronto,3dmimv,ladieslovetheflowehh,3,Fri Jul 17 15:59:33 2015 UTC,"the problem is that there are too many cars and not enough space. even driving smoothly by leaving more space, now there is less space behind you. stop light tag isnt as big of an issue as the fact that there are simply too many cars and not enough road to be able to maintain enough space to maintant a high speed."
toronto,3dmimv,quazy,-1,Fri Jul 17 16:52:08 2015 UTC,"too many cars and not enough space   That is a result of people not properly adjusting their speed ahead of time. Once they get packed in close, it ripples back. Stop light tag is definitely an issue. I constantly pass people in the middle lane while going 100km/h because all of the people in the left lane want to go go go and accel/decel over and over. By the time they reach the spot in traffic where the transport in the middle lane was overtaking the one in the right, I've passed it because I just waited it out and coasted smoothly. Then I am free to take the left lane and continue on passing people still going 100.  The point is, too many cars and not enough space is caused by the drivers cramming themselves in there in the first place."
toronto,3dmimv,ladieslovetheflowehh,3,Fri Jul 17 17:30:12 2015 UTC,eventually saturation is reached and even avoiding light tag does very little. and the 401 is at that point. stop and go traffic all through business hours from the airport to the 404.
toronto,3dmimv,quazy,2,Fri Jul 17 17:50:47 2015 UTC,Make these things permanent.  I particularly like the HOT lane idea mentioned at the bottom of the article.
toronto,3dmimv,j0hnnyengl1sh,11,Fri Jul 17 14:01:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a little confused as to why it works. Surely all it does is make for faster journey times for those who willing to pay the extra, and force the less well off to have to sit in the slower traffic? Does it actually reduce traffic volumes, and if so how?"
toronto,3dmimv,Phaedrus64,15,Fri Jul 17 14:22:03 2015 UTC,"It annoys people into compliance.  Which is the city's modus operandi - if you cannot make (insert city function here, ie mass transit) a good, comfortable, safe and desireable consumer experience, annoy them enough with the alternatives that they are forced to adopt your substandard service offering."
toronto,3dmimv,1slinkydink1,8,Fri Jul 17 14:25:07 2015 UTC,"It's a form of transportation demand management. If they introduce HOV/T lanes it has a few affects.   increases the cost of travel ($ or time), this discourages people from driving and looking into other alternatives increases occupancy, if you take two single drivers and encourage them to carpool, you've just reduced the traffic impact of those drivers by 50%   Of course this will only work with continued investment in transit to provide actually alternatives for people to use instead of driving."
toronto,3dmimv,j0hnnyengl1sh,5,Fri Jul 17 14:42:06 2015 UTC,"But surely HOT allows those who can afford to pay to use the additional lane to travel faster to do so, creating income-based traffic flows. As that happens and more people justify spending the money to drive in the HOT lane, so there is less traffic in the regular lanes, thus reducing the incentive to pay the extra.  Congestion is caused by too many vehicles. I don't understand how having a toll lane removes vehicles from the road, it seems like it would just re-order them around basic economic principles."
toronto,3dmimv,Jon_Targaryen__,3,Fri Jul 17 14:49:26 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how having a toll lane removes vehicles from the road, it seems like it would just re-order them around basic economic principles.   It is basic economic principles. Limiting the supply of lanes (HOV), increasing the price (HOT), or a combination limits the supply of lanes for single occupant vehicles and could raise much needed funds to support the very high cost provincial/municipal highways.   This leads to the phenomenon of disappearing traffic, which is exactly what the city needs to create better flowing TTC surface routes."
toronto,3dmimv,j0hnnyengl1sh,2,Fri Jul 17 16:29:34 2015 UTC,"Right, but where that falls down for me (and I'm fully willing to accept that I may be missing something here, I'm just trying to understand the concept) is in the idea of HOT specifically. HOT seems counterintuitive to HOV in my mind.   HOV specifically takes vehicles off the roads because other than those vehicles which were travelling 2 up anyway, for each vehicle in the lane someone has had to leave their vehicle at home in order to facilitate the faster journey for the group. HOT on the other hand seems to undermine this principle because it replaces the requirement to access the HOV with a financial alternative, which while having a benefit to the city doesn't have any positive impact upon congestion because vehicles aren't being removed.  Taken to its logical conclusion, commercial travellers will justify spending on HOT access because it's company money and that's an easy expense to justify. But there's only one lane and there are lots of commercial travellers, so they're quickly going to get in each others' way and the HOT lane won't seem so appealing any more. In particular, those people going out of their way to carpool in order to get to work half an hour faster are now no longer realising that benefit, so their incentive to not take their own car is diminished and we're now regressing.  I stress, I'm not arguing against HOT specifically because I have no experience of it and therefore I'm only applying my own theoretical principles to it. I fully accept I could be wrong, I'm just trying to get my head round the idea."
toronto,3dmimv,Jon_Targaryen__,2,Fri Jul 17 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"A HOT lane that replaces a standard lane will still limit the number of vehicles that can travel on the highway, due to higher cost.    which while having a benefit to the city doesn't have any positive impact upon congestion because vehicles aren't being removed.   There are benefits. It limits the number of single occupancy vehicles, which clears traffic from city streets. And it brings in much needed revenue to fund expensive highway upkeep, which can divert more funding for transit.    But there's only one lane and there are lots of commercial travellers, so they're quickly going to get in each others' way and the HOT lane won't seem so appealing any more.   If HOT/HOV lanes become that highly trafficked, they can replace another standard lane with HOT/HOV lane. That moves the city even closer to the goal of getting rid of more single occupancy vehicles.    I stress, I'm not arguing against HOT specifically because I have no experience of it and therefore I'm only applying my own theoretical principles to it. I fully accept I could be wrong, I'm just trying to get my head round the idea.   It comes down to the fact that you can't build more roads to fix traffic. More highway lanes for single occupant vehicles just means more vehicles being dumped into the fixed sized grid of the city. More highway lanes aren't even feasible because they take up so much space.   If there were enough people willing to carpool on HOV or pay tolls to access HOT lanes to fill up the Gardiner, then ultimately we wouldn't even need to waste money supporting on lanes for single occupant vehicles."
toronto,3dmimv,j0hnnyengl1sh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:06:39 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you got downvoted for this.....  Still, I'm not convinced it really answers my main concern still, which is that HOT seems to at least partially abandon a commitment to reducing congestion and introduce an alternative of raising revenues. Both are valid activities but I'm not sure they're completely compatible in this situation. In order for it to work I think it would have to be sufficiently expensive as to dissuade the majority of drivers from using the HOT lane. If there are lots of vehicles in it then I'm not going to pay to do it, but if it's too expensive then the cost of infrastructure to capture the users' information is going to take a long time to recover.  I'm not averse to tolls, but they seem much better suited to entire roads than to individual lanes."
toronto,3dmimv,Jon_Targaryen__,3,Fri Jul 17 17:37:06 2015 UTC,"I think the big problem is that most people are averse to tolls. Despite the reality that traffic in Toronto sucks, and the only solution is to reduce the number of cars, anyone that runs for mayor on a platform of tolling every lane of the DVP/Gardiner has very little chance of succeeding. Likewise a Premier who would toll the 401 through Toronto.  However, a more politically savvy phased roll-out of tolls/more HOV one lane a a time is more achievable."
toronto,3dmimv,j0hnnyengl1sh,2,Fri Jul 17 17:54:23 2015 UTC,"I can see the logic of that, although I'd suggest that the risk of that is that if HOT doesn't work then people will complain heavily about getting no value for their toll money and become even more resistant to the idea of a fully tolled road.  I've said it before on these discussions on /r/toronto, but by far my preferred method of raising revenues and reducing congestion is to introduce downtown congestion charging. Rather than charging people for using the arterial routes, I'd like us to charge for getting off them.   I'd also make company parking inside the congestion charging zone a taxable benefit in kind based upon reasonable rates - for example, one of my neighbours drives to work every day because his company provides him with free parking at his office on Bay. Assuming he's at the office 200 days per year and assuming that parking downtown for the day costs around $20, that's a $4000 benefit he's receiving for free. If you're suddenly getting a $2000 a year tax bill for your parking on top of the costs of driving (gas, wear and tear etc), the $140 a month Metropass starts to look more attractive."

Personally I think this is BS. We all pay to maintain those roads, we shouldn't have to pay a premium to use certain lanes."

Probably still a better net outcome over several highway merge situations, but certainly not a 50% reduction over the whole trip(s). That's highly idealized."

My driving commute time to work (West end Scarborough <-> Midtown) varies between 20 minutes and 40 minutes given low to high traffic. By TTC, best case scenario is 55 minutes, usually 1hr 15min on average. With the increased traffic that is now forced on artery streets like Yonge, my driving time now is about 1 hr, on par with TTC. A little bit better with time shifting maybe. The HOV lanes lanes have increased my commute time without offering a better alternative.

It doesn't need to be that over engineered anyways, there is no need for them to be separated. It's a ""nice to have"", but not a requirement.  How do we make sure people don't speed? There's no physical device that keeps people from speeding. Trucks are supposed to have governors installed, but they are so easy to over ride that they are useless. So what do we do?

A ticket for violating an HOT lane could include demerit points, monetary fines, and a penalty fee (plus applicable taxes) for unauthorized use of the lane.  There are other tickets that also deprive the province of revenue. If one drives without a license, they have deprived the province of revenue, the result is an expensive ticket and demerit points."

Debt is pilling up. If the change doesnt happen the seniors will have no new place to move into. It needs sprinkler systems for safety and is being replaced with new affordable housing units that existing tenants can move into when it is completed. They are being put into temporary accommodation till this happens. And as a bonus more units will be available to help with the 300 person wait list for affordable housing."

However, I think the main issue is, there is nowhere for them to go for four years (and possibly more, because when has anything ever been constructed on time?)  Moving is stressful, so they'll have to do it twice (once out of this place into wherever they're going, and once into the newly constructed place)  Add to the fact that you're saying to a 99 year old (as in the article) ""your new home will be ready for you by the time you turn 103."""
toronto,3dmo97,JoanOfArctic,7,Fri Jul 17 15:32:21 2015 UTC,The alternative is the place goes bankrupt and all tenants are kicked to the curb when the place is condemned because it isnt safe.

toronto,3dpl4j,jkozuch,2,Sat Jul 18 13:35:26 2015 UTC,"The crown refused to make her final submissions public and made no verbal final submission. If you read his lawyer's final submissions paying careful attention to what was said in court by both accusers, coupled with the fact that the crown did not want to make hers public, in my opinion that should be enough to make up your own mind. If it's not for you, then just wait until the judge rules. The point of sharing his submissions I believe is to end the lies that are being spread around by friend's of the accusers saying that he followed them around in real life, took photos of them, showed up at events they were attending. Those are LIES. If you read this legal document you will see that the accusers NEVER actually said any of those things. * Correction: Yes, apparently the crown did make a very short verbal closing statement on the last day, but I was right in saying she did not want to share her written submissions."

toronto,3dpl4j,Randomfinn,0,Sat Jul 18 14:37:21 2015 UTC,"It isn't ...normal... to release closing submissions like this. It is frowned upon by judges and the legal community because it takes a formal, legal affair into the realm of trial by public. Canadian courts do NOT want to follow the example of American courts.   The Crown did make a verbal closing argument (I have no idea why the OP said thy didn't) as per normal procedure - and of the appropriate length. Such a lengthy closing argument gives the impression the defense is grasping at straws and throwing out any and all possible defenses in the hopes that one sticks. If the Crown had released their closing arguments like the prosecution they would have been censured and had their career impacted."

You seem to know more than his lawyer who I'm pretty sure would not have released this had he thought it would affect the case or his client at all. Here's the thing: this is a PUBLiC document. This trial is PUBLiC. Anyone can request information on this case at court. He just made it easier by sharing it online.
toronto,3dpl4j,Randomfinn,0,Sat Jul 18 21:07:38 2015 UTC,"I am part of the GTA legal community but not a lawyer. Yes, this is public information but is usually released in a manner that will benefit the case in the courtroom, not the case being tried in the newspapers (also, not piss off the judge that expects legal etiquette to be followed).

I really don't think they'd be stupid enough to dhare this without consulting the lawyer and in turn I really don't think the lawyer would've said yes if it could be considered bad legal etiquette. Plus I'm sure they weren't too happy reading the lies being spread by supporters of the accusers, saying things like Gregory followed them around, went to events they were in  and took photos of them. By sharing this legal document, it confirms those are made up lies as you can read exactly what he is being accused of and what was said by the accusers during trial.

Releasing this was a stupid, stupid move that just discredited all the work his lawyer did, and the unprofessional language and format of the closing argument will only harm his case.  I know the courts are trying to keep control of this case and leave it unbiased by yellow journalism (oh hai Christie) because some unstable people have fixated on it."

toronto,3dpii7,TheArgsenal,5,Sat Jul 18 05:44:08 2015 UTC,"It sucks, but it really is needed. Every week the jobs that can't be done in the small window from 2-5AM are completed on Sunday mornings. This includes track replacement, electrical and signal replacement, and structural repairs, just to name a few. Without this crucial maintenance work, the system would be far worse off than it already is.   Edit: article for proof http://torontoist.com/2009/11/rocket_talk_1/"
toronto,3dpii7,Jono89,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:24:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you're wrong, but do you have a source for this? It seems odd to me that they need an extra 3 hours on Sunday mornings for maintenance. I was under the impression that this was a cost saving measure."

toronto,3dpii7,Jono89,0,Sat Jul 18 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I wish they could run slightly improved service along young from 6-9 when the subway isn't open but I guess that's a cost issue.   Another alternative could be to only keep the sections closed that need maintenance for that particular week and have the rest of the line operating. That might be more trouble than it's worth, but 9am opening really screws over a lot of people who work on Sundays and I do think it's worth investigating some alternatives."
toronto,3dpii7,TheArgsenal,2,Sat Jul 18 18:45:03 2015 UTC,"The thing is, the whole line is being worked on every Sunday morning. There will usually be a minimum of 20 different jobs going on, many of which involving work cars (the big yellow trains with cranes, and other equipment built in). I agree that the busses should be running more frequently, but having trains running just isn't feasible.   The original design of the system should have been similar to New York, where there is a third track running down the centre of the tunnel. That way you can shut down one track, and still have two operating."
toronto,3dpii7,Jono89,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:15:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it seems like a big blunder not to have had that, especially considering the Toronto Subway was built so much later than New York's."

I'd suggest re-tracing your steps and pay special attention to areas where your bag (or wherever you keep them) were disturbed - did you trip, jump a curb or grab anything from your bag at any time during this trip (maybe you grabbed coffee)? Go back to those areas.  Look on the ground, in the gutters or the edges of gardens or pathways. Then look at the areas people might put things to make them easier to spot - hanging off lampposts, on top of mailboxes etc. And then look a little above it, where tall people might put things for the same reason (this is what happened to me).  Talk to businesses or organizations on your route. It is possible the keys were found and turned in to one of them.  Do this a few times and hopefully it works for you. It worked for me."

The rich treat fines as slaps on the wrist, and the poor treat them as fucking draconian punishments.  Moreso, the inverse makes even more sense, because they aren't punishing people below the poverty lines with municipal violations that put them into a legal hell. An unexpected $50 expense, on top of fines that being unable to pay that initial ticket, can suck a poor family dry for months at a time, if not result in jail time for missed payments.

No, they're not quite as clear as my $300 pair, but they're literally 1/30th the price and perfectly serviceable. I've work them everyday for almost a year now with no issues. I cannot recommend this site enough.   ClearlyContacts is good value, too. More expensive than Zenni, but good value at the end of the day."

It had coatings and everything. You just have to know your prescription and try it on with a selfie you upload lol so you're pretty much guessing what it will look and feel like. Not a bad trade off for a free pair though. Mind you, this was a couple years ago.  So i wanted to try it but the pair I wanted was only at a discount for new accounts. Got it for 69 bucks tax and shipping included. Black pair of plastic frame glasses with some coatings.  I'd personally recommend it to people that have experienced buying a pair of glasses for 400-500 dollars or more. Its definitely MUCH cheaper for a quality pair of glasses.  Edit: googled this and found the code to enter at checkout... not sure if it still works: FIRSTPAIRFREECA"

I also got Timberlands for about $100 then they sent me a coupon for a free pair.  I also got a free pair when I referred someone.    Now, my prescription is pretty weak (-.50) and thicker lenses cost more.  Still, they take back whatever you are unhappy with, no questions asked."

I'm sure the driver of such a vehicle would be only too grateful that this small cost was the only result of his or her impulsive and dangerous parking choices, and even more relieved to know that such damage was probably2 necessary to prevent a cyclist from becoming injured.

toronto,3dikz8,Ecsta,15,Thu Jul 16 16:29:32 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily true. In Ontario, we have fault determination rules (Google it). Rule 17 (2) states that (2) If automobile “A” is illegally parked, stopped or standing when it is struck by automobile “B” and if the incident occurs outside a city, town or village, the driver of automobile “A” is 100 per cent at fault and the driver of automobile “B” is not at fault for the incident.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 668, s. 17 (2).  The problem here is that this would have occurred within a city. Stupid laws and their words.  But under tort law, the argument will be made that the proximate cause of the accident is that the vehicle was parked in a no parking zone. He is the cause of the incident. He was negligent in ignoring the posted rules, thus at fault."

toronto,3dikz8,pizdobol,3,Thu Jul 16 17:11:58 2015 UTC,"I am a claims adjuster in Ontario who deals with this stuff regularly.  When two vehicles are involved in a collision, the fault determination rules (or ""no-fault"" system) is enacted. Essentially each vehicle involved goes back to their own insurer for vehicle damages. Based on those rules, we assign fault accordingly.   When a pedestrian or cyclist is involved with a vehicle, it's a different ball of wax. There is a term called reverse onus, whereby the fault is immediately placed on the vehicle, and the vehicle's owner/insurer must prove that they were not negligent.   If a cyclist were to hit this car, the car would absolutely be 100% at fault. A good adjuster or lawyer would probably be able to reduce the liability slightly, but I would argue no more than a 90/10 split against the vehicle. The cyclist, if he/she had no insurance of their own, could claim injury coverage through the car owner's insurance. The cyclist could also bring a lawsuit for injuries that would be above and beyond what's covered by the basic injury coverage."

This is why there is a painted stopbar ahead of them 4) follow point above and don't creep into the mixing zone and wait there on red light while the pedestrians are trying to cross North-South direction 5) again -  it's a shared pathway.....meaning you must yield to pedestrians at all times  6) be understanding and patient with construction workers doing something on/along the bike trail.

toronto,3dikz8,pizdobol,2,Fri Jul 17 13:57:12 2015 UTC,I guess that is a constant problem of bikers vs motorists....you can only hope that they don't do something sudden and stupid :D  drivers are also making some major mistakes o the new street though. biggest issues I see daily is drivers going southbound and turning left on queens quay do not follow the line painting markings and drive onto the bike trail or TTC ROW instead of the eastbound lane. Also some drivers do not realize there is a designated turn left turn right traffic signals and they are not at all intersections....  it's a big learning curve for everyone I guess.

They told me that individual drivers have no control over the heat/AC and it is set electronically to all vehicles by someone in the control centre. So, the vehicle you were on likely had a malfunction that the driver didn't bother to report. Or he did report it and was told to keep it in service for the rush hours and to bring it back once they could decrease service."

Almost everything would get picked up, and there was virtually no waste. they didn't abuse the system - and we didn't get overwhelmed with a lot of people.

A lot of places refuse to even let workers go home with food that would otherwise have to be put in the trash.  This exists because food that needs to be refrigerated or handled in a certain way could potentially be mishandled and someone could get sick.

As king we could make it so he would be powerless and ineligible to run for any office in the city. As a result the laughs would never end. Plus we could make the tracksuit the official dress of the king. Or better yet we could dress Ford up like the Ikea monkey.  Best of all with Ford being Ford, he would probably accept the position."

toronto,3dlngt,kearneycation,5,Fri Jul 17 20:21:36 2015 UTC,"You may be getting some false inputs here; wait times in urban Toronto are 60-90 days for a psychiatrist, sometimes up to 6 months. However, a suburban Newmarket hospital may be MUCH better. Even a walk-in clinic doctor in Newmarket may be able to provide a referral to a psychiatrist within that network, and will be able to provide a good estimate on wait times.  However, the rest is true: an ER will be the FASTEST route to a diagnosis by way of an on-call psychiatrist, seen that day - and they will be under that psychiatrist's care from then on.   However, their initial experience may not be pleasant and they do risk being ""formed,"" meaning, having their rights taken away if they do not present to the ER with another individual who states they will be responsible for them when they are discharged. Your friend could be kept at the hospital for a few days.  Additionally, if they do initially present, alone, to their physician or a clinic doctor and state they are suicidal, the doctor can fill out the same form (again, this is colloquially called being ""formed,"") and that doctor will have to potentially call police to transfer them directly to the ER. The doctor will ask if a family member can take custody, or occasionally a social worker can be made available to make this transfer in a more gentle manner, but if not, police do have to make this transfer with the patient in handcuffs - and the individual remains in police custody as such until the psychiatrist on-call completes their initial interview. This wait can be hours, in the main ER waiting room, and this is not a good way to go in.  Therefore, if your friend is indeed feeling suicidal and has no one else to go with him to these appointments, I would recommend he present directly to the ER to avoid such an experience. The above is the legal liability reality for our doctors, it's not intended to be a cruel thing - but it results in a traumatic possibility, and it's something your friend should try to avoid."
toronto,3dlngt,fayzeshyft,3,Fri Jul 17 16:28:18 2015 UTC,This is the best option. Is your friend close/able to make it there?
toronto,3dlngt,VictoriaElaine,5,Fri Jul 17 11:56:01 2015 UTC,Actually it's not - the best option is going to the ER of your local hospital - they will admit him to the psychiatric unit and then transfer to CAMH if necessary.

I am sorry you have had a negative experience with them, but at no point did I ever see, or hear of, anyone having had a violent experience in their care. I would never hesitate to recommend the care of St.Michaels to anyone seeking mental health care."
toronto,3dlngt,mechantmechant,16,Sat Jul 18 01:55:52 2015 UTC,"I've been through this before. A few times, sadly, and it's never an easy situation for anyone. Please take this information seriously.  First off, if at ANY point you feel your friend is a serious risk of harming themselves, DO NOT HESITATE to call the police. The worst possible thing that could happen is you knowing and next thing you know they're dead. That is a pain many will never get over and only send you into a downward spiral.  I had a friend many years back who was in a pretty shitty spot in life, was self medicating and I knew was mildly suicidal. I was helping her, and I provided excellent help, but I was no professional. I hesitated. I got a call one morning saying ""I'm sorry, I've done it, I'm so sorry"" and she hung up.  I called the police immediately and within 10 minutes both police and EMS were there. They took her into custody under the mental health act and in for monitoring and evaluation after her stomach was pumped and she was observed to be stable. I may have saved her life.  To say she hated me would be an understatement. It was horrible, but I did the right thing. That anger kept her from harming herself again and ultimately over the next few weeks leveled herself out. We lost contact for about 2 years, but has recently come back into my life a few months ago. She reached out to tell me I did in fact save her from those times, as much as she hated me then, she loves me now. She's been sober for nearly 2 years, has gotten a great job, a wonderful partner and looks better than she's ever been. She's TRULY happy. It happened because I cared.   Your friend may be reaching out to you asking for help, he just doesn't know how.  The other thing you should consider is YOU calling the local crisis line (Google it for what's the closest for you) and asking for advice. It's anonymous and they WILL help guide you on how to approach the issue and what the best steps are.  Good luck. Thanks for being a good person."

toronto,3dlngt,Randomfinn,11,Fri Jul 17 14:35:27 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't take 30-60 days to see a regular GP and I don't see why it would take multiple days off work. I think that's just a depressed person catastrophizing. He can see a doctor same day at a walk in clinic.  I know mental health help can be scarce, but I think what you're hearing about excuses why he can't get help is just someone who is depressed and scared of seeing a doctor thinking the system is even worse than it is."
toronto,3dlngt,art_738292,3,Fri Jul 17 09:36:17 2015 UTC,"Its 90 days or more to see a psychiatrist, which the GP will refer him to. But if you're suicidal, go directly to CAMH emergency and you will be seen immediately.  And if you're job won't give you time off because you're suicidal, you can sue their asses to the wall."
toronto,3dlngt,jilliefish,2,Fri Jul 17 15:00:41 2015 UTC,"Are the sucidal comments in email/txt/blog? Then contact the police and see if they will pick him up and take him in for an evaluation. (I've also had people picked up for verbal allusions, it is just easier to have the proof).   People threatening suicide either need immediate in-person professional help (because continuing to talk to them long distance is actually harming them and making a suicide attempt more likely) or drama kings that want attention and you need to know, via a professional, which one you are dealing with.   Doctors and medical health - especially crisis mental health, are same day services. Yes, he may miss work, same as if he broke his leg he would probably miss a few days too. Newmarket is a big city and has local resources (although I concur CAMH is the best but hardly several days journey - it is about an hour away via public transit). So you friend is not telling you the truth, think about why that may be and why you are so willing to believe their lies."

toronto,3dlngt,phillybrownpants,2,Fri Jul 17 12:42:09 2015 UTC,"If your friend contacts you again with intention, you need to act fast and call the ER from this hospital: http://www.southlakeregional.org/Default.aspx?cid=247 Since you're in the US, I wouldn't really know how you'd be able to call the nearest police dep in their area.  Basically what would happen is, the ambulance shows up with a cop car to make sure he'll be secure.  Next, upon arrival to the ER, your friend will be checked with blood tests to be done.  If he straights up tell the paramedics that he tried to overdose on pills/substances then they'll immediately pump his stomach. After all this is over, a crisis nurse will ask your friend all sorts of questions, to pretty get him to admit what happened and why.  Then a psychiatrist will evaluate him.  There's a huge chance he will get admitted to the adult psychiatric unit (I checked to see if this hospital offers one, and it does).  Once he's feeling a little bit better (next day or so) he will get transferred to the unit.  There he will on a Form 1, 2 or 3.  I don't remember which form means what, but it means he is required to stay in the unit for at least 72hrs. In the unit, there are all sorts of patients who have similar or entirely different reasons for being there.  There are social workers, nurses, psychiatrists and everythng he needs.  They'll be meeting with him on and off for the remainder of his stay and devise a safety plan.  Next, he'll be assigned a psychiatrist he can see for as long as he needs once he's discharged (an appointment evey month).  He may even have to see a social worker on and off as well. This is how I was able to get my first psychiatrist without having to wait months for a GP to refer me to one.  Sorry for being so detailed, but this is how it works when you call someone in to help your friend.  He may be peeved about the whole thing, but will be getting exactly the help he needs."

I hope the people that keep going on about how burdened the traditional taxi service is by regulation remember this.  Basically taxi rides could drop overnight by 30% if you get rid of these plate holders.
toronto,3dibm7,in4real,36,Thu Jul 16 15:24:43 2015 UTC,"For my return trip, I called Diamond Taxi. The driver fit a template I knew only too well. He was a middle-aged immigrant man, stuck in the cab industry because there was nothing else. He’d been at work since 6 a.m. Like almost every other driver in the city, he didn’t own his car. Instead, he rented one for $80 per day. This was for a 12-hour day shift. Another driver rented the car at night for $90.  A large chunk of these rental charges go toward leasing the Toronto cab plate attached to the car. The Diamond driver had two hours left in his 12-hour shift. I asked him how much he had grossed for the day. He pulled it up on his meter: $109.  He had to pay $80 for the day rental, plus fuel. By the end of the day, he estimated, he would net between $20 and $40.   There is something messed up about a system where people pay what seem like fairly high taxi fares, but the drivers themselves are making less than $5 an hour, while a student driving for Uber part time can clear up to $1,000 a week."

At the same time though, we can't ignore the fact that some people (I KNOW NOT ALL OF THEM /r/Toronto) have saved a lot of money working their asses off for these plates with an inflated, unregulated value, which was caused by the city. I'm not saying it's right that many plate owners don't drive and overcharge the drivers, or that the price has gotten so out of control, but that's because the city dropped the ball, and all the drivers have been trying to do is follow the rules.  If you saved for 20 years to buy a $300,000 home, which the city then opened a landfill next to dropping the value to next to nothing, I would expect quite a bit of outrage and some sort of compensation for the fact that the city was responsible for the disaster. I know it's not the best analogy, but it's not too far off.

Or, in the ways of the Beer Store, 3 non Canadian companies pushing substandard beer to people at inflated prices, ultimately screwing Ontarians.  Uber is like the craft brewery. Anyone can start one and as long as you pass a few safety tests (ie: safe car, etc) and adhere to the basics (rules of the road), you're set to go. It's an open market. You can go to any brewery and pickup their product, and not a penny goes overseas but instead super locally to people like your neighbour or the guy around the corner to support his family while you purchase something you need (err, want).    To sum it up, the (main) people who are peeved here are overseas investors, immigrants who can't find work and people who are tired of only having the option for substandard service. These drivers are making peanuts every day, how the fuck do they support any sort of family or even a poverty lifestyle? They'd be better off getting a loan, buying a car and driving for Uber.

I have no problem putting money into their pockets for supplying, maintaining and providing ongoing improvements to a system that is dramatically changing the landscape of how we travel.  Further, they have saved me a ton of grief in other cities. When I was travelling in the USA I had NO idea on who to call for a taxi. Uber was there in minutes. In Detroit, I waited 45 minutes for a cab to show up, only for it to be a early 90's Astro van that was barely running, seats torn to shit and we were highly intimidated by the driver. On the way back, Uber'd it and got this guy driving a Civic, told us some great places to hit up that are lesser known and was there in 4 minutes for half the cost we paid on the prior trip.  Worked in 5 other cities I was in within a week period. All of them perfect. Didn't have to lookup cab numbers, I had no idea where I was most of the time and didn't have to worry about local cabbies fucking me on the route for money.  I'll gladly line the pockets of that company that provides such a service for me while employing people at good rates."
toronto,3dibm7,ilovedillpickles,13,Thu Jul 16 17:42:15 2015 UTC,"Sure, Uber is making money hand-over-fist, but they are also employing hundreds (thousands?) of our family, friends and community at fair and reasonable rates while providing an outstanding service to the rest of us.   Woah hold up there. Uper provides a convenient service no doubt but the pro-Uber love in here is getting out of control. The way they treat their workers is one of the most legit concerns people have with Uber.   Credit to /u/amnesiajune for going into detail on this.   The big issue to me isn't just protecting consumers - it's also protecting the drivers. A huge problem with Uber's model IMO is that they shit on drivers by calling them ""partners"" rather than employees. That means they don't get any rights or benefits. Use the Spotify thing as an example - Uber told their drivers ""If you want business, you have to let people stream music in your car, and you have to pay for the membership and the data usage. Oh, and by the way, we're reducing fares indefinitely so you're gonna make 20% less."" The result was that a lot of drivers make significantly less than the American minimum wage, and that's completely legal because being an ""independent contractor"" strips them of all their workplace protections. (As a side note, the journalist from that story actually became an UberX driver, and found that she made just $9.36 an hour). ""Taxi companies in Toronto and other Canadian cities are subject to a raft of regulations from which Uber is exempt. Taxi drivers, for their part, have typically shelled out vast amounts for one of the limited supply of official taxi plates, an expense Uber drivers are spared."" That's a minor issue. A taxicab driver's and owner's license here in Toronto cost $650 and as little as $500, respectively, according to the city's website. The bigger difference between the two are the other regulations. Taxis have to be equipped with several cameras that protect the passengers, as well as a hijack warning system that protects the driver. You also need to have a car big enough to comfortably seat four passengers (source) and a proper commercial insurance policy, not the subcompact with personal insurance that most Uber drivers use."
toronto,3dibm7,correctsstupidpeople,2,Thu Jul 16 15:44:22 2015 UTC,Did you read the article. The cab industry is getting drivers to work for around $5/hour after all the BS. Do you think this is better?

toronto,3dibm7,Born_Ruff,3,Thu Jul 16 16:26:40 2015 UTC,"""#TAXI"" has existed for years, completely eliminating your one valid argument that it was easier to call an uber than a cab. Everything else is hearsay with no evidence to back it up.  I enjoy the discounted rates as well. Look at my post history, I use and defend Uber regularly. It doesn't change the fact that Uber is a business, and a really fucking dirty one at that. Do you not remember them getting busted for ordering hundreds of cabs to competing services to tie up competition making them appear superior? This was for Lyft, not Beck Taxi. And they got busted doing this multiple times.  They're in it to profit, and when competition has been minimized and there's very few actual cabs in this city, you'll regret blindly supporting the cheaper option.  Give it a try, order an uber during an event, subway closure or storm. Your wait will be just as long as a cab and the cost will be MUCH higher.   If there's no regulated competition for you to choose from, what's to stop them from continuously increasing the surge pricing? Where are you going to go?"
toronto,3dibm7,smokeTO,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:21:58 2015 UTC,"Yep, last time the subway was down. Hailed a cab... he said ""Where you going? cash only $40"". It's a $12 fare. At least Uber is upfront about it. No one is suggesting we abolish tradition cabs. In fact its an option within the Uber app to order a Taxi. Just that the rules need to be updated and the plate cartels need to be broken. And finally the Taxi companies need to do something about improving service and create a system of accountability where the consumer gets instant gratification after a legitimate complaint."

Why in the world would they have a salaried well-paid position?    Because that's what people deserve. Not everyone gets to choose where they work. That shouldn't influence their income.   Anyone can do it. It's not professional work, they're not building rockets or whatever.    Did you just waltz in from the 1950s? People who build rockets are contract workers getting paid a fraction of what they deserve because organizations such as NASA are underfunded, and because the military only offers gov't contracts to the lowest bidder. The fact that you assumed a professional position like a person who builds rockets takes home a salary only proves my point. Thanks! :)   Does the guy working at McDonalds have a 'salaried well-paying full benefits' position? He probably qualifies to be a cab driver. He probably drives to work just fine.   If you work at McDonald's you can't afford a car. They make minimum wage, if they're even full-time.

Anyone can start one and as long as you pass a few safety tests (ie: safe car, etc) and adhere to the basics (rules of the road), you're set to go. It's an open market. You can go to any brewery and pickup their product, and not a penny goes overseas but instead super locally to people like your neighbour or the guy around the corner to support his family while you purchase something you need (err, want).     Excuse me?  Uber, an overseas corporation,  gets a 20% cut of fares,  does it not? Uber is underwritten by overseas investors,  no?  Investors who will profit enormously from an Uber IPO?  This is the faultiest analogy I've ever seen. Contract drivers aren't craft brewers, and they are gaining vastly less than the salaried, full-time Uber employees in Silicon Valley or Uber's wealthy investors (including Goldman Sachs)."

The ruling was much more narrow in that Uber was not currently in violation of ""a law"" was it was written.

The cab industry is happy to roll with the image that the people who are suffering are the hard-working recent immigrants busting their butts to make ends meet.  You choose to take Uber? You're taking food out of the mouths of the children of this driver - and he doesn't even get to see his kids because he's working all day!  The next time the cab industry has a protest (ie, the owners tell their drivers they better go to city hall if they want to be able to rent a cab to drive again next week), i'd be quite pleased if Uber or someone stood next to the parked cars with signs like ""The owner of this cab is worth $10m"". ""This cab is owned by a dentist in Florida."" etc."
toronto,3dibm7,mrfroggy,3,Fri Jul 17 01:34:53 2015 UTC,"These are the more/less annual costs if you have a taxi in toronto. $1000 for two d.o.t (inspections). $1000 for renewal of sticker, $6500 for brokerage fees, car payment (taxi's have a list of cars to choose from, typically mid size to luxury vehicles) $4000. Insurance is $10000. Repairs are roughly $2000. all together thats $24500. Thats why Taxi's are more expensive, and plate holders charge a certain amount per month.   The annual cost for Uber is basically a 20% brokerage fee, repairs roughly $2000. Insurance $2000, car payment (can be any car so payments can be much lower). Of course they can afford to charge their customers less. Their overhead is less than a quarter of what their competition has.  Many people don't understand the expenses that taxi's have, so they're quick to defend the cheaper option. They're perception is so distorted because of the cost that they claim the service of uber is superior vs the taxi's. When in actuality, aside from the app, you're sitting in the back seat of a car and being driven from one location to another.    Its the plate owners that own more than one plate that make the business a shitty environment. Making roughly $2000 per month on a taxi plate isn't anything to brag about, however when you own 20 or more plates that $2000 per month adds up in a hurry."

My father was a cabbie for a period in the 1980s and the racket was in full force as far back as then (and prior).  Sadly, no one cared back then because, like now, the cab industry is an immigrant industry in Toronto.  Here's the thing, all this article does, like the many many other pro-Uber and anti-car articles - is further enforce the idea that Uber is such a great, fair idea, that we'd be stupid not to embrace it.  Except, this article, like the many many others, does nothing to note that Uber is openly defiant of the law.  The isn't disruptive technology anymore.  Uber is disrupting law and society.  Is it good?  Well, it might be right now, but what if someone else comes in, with a less refined PR machine and user experience, and decides to openly defy the law that impacts a segment of the population that is less reviled?  Will we be consistent in our acceptance and tolerance?  Or will we be hypocrites?  Uber could have chosen to engage the city in a more respectful way, and work actively to change the rules.  Except, they pegged the dreaded cabbie against us... Evil evil cabbie!  Of course we're all jumping up and down!  Look it's cheaper!  Look the UberX cars don't smell like curry or look like shit!

toronto,3di001,Nevyn42,2,Fri Jul 17 02:52:50 2015 UTC,Nice you must have other services with Rogers to warrant that price.
toronto,3di001,Toy_Cop,-5,Fri Jul 17 03:09:02 2015 UTC,Same. Morons in this thread don't understand that all you have to do is call in and ASK for a better price. Socially inept morons that can't deal with having to speak to another person in this thread.
toronto,3di001,veritasxe,2,Fri Jul 17 12:09:48 2015 UTC,You shouldn't have to call and threaten to cancel when you want a decent price! Plus remember they have ALL kinds of scummy business moves

My German plan currently has no bandwith limit, which is quite useful as we netflix/game quite a bit. The 30€ includes 19% VAT though, so the ""base"" price would actually be more like €25 ($35). The cheapest plan I can find on the Rogers website right now is $39.99 for 30Mbps down and with a 100GB bandwith limit. I guess it depends on what promotions they're running and whether you manage to catch a good one."

toronto,3di001,pepedude,3,Thu Jul 16 14:37:15 2015 UTC,"To be fair (I'm Romanian), Romania has quite good internet (in terms of speed and cost). It highly rates among top 10 in the world. Canada has some of the most expensive in the developed world due to the fact that we get ripped off by our big companies. It's not exactly apples to oranges.  If we compared across other things, we have overall much more purchasing power in Canada, and I question how some of my Romanian relatives survive on the average salary there.  Your point still stands that in Canada, we are getting gouged on all things telecommunications."
toronto,3di001,gonemeta,0,Fri Jul 17 12:06:50 2015 UTC,"And in Romania, the average person has purchasing power equivalent to roughly $9K per year. In Canada, it is about $52k per year."

toronto,3di001,gonemeta,-1,Fri Jul 17 01:27:28 2015 UTC,"The point is services are generally going to be cheaper where people have less purchasing power. You can't compare the price of a cup of coffee that goes for the equivalent of  0.0005 cents in say, Zimbabwe, and conclude that in Canada we are getting ripped-off because we pay on average $1.50 for that same cup. There are numerous factors that come into play such as volatile currency fluctuations, disposable income, inflation and so on. To say nothing of the fact that electricity and computer equipment can be more expensive in some places and not as readily available as in Canada."
toronto,3di001,CuntWeasel,0,Fri Jul 17 01:33:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know where you got those numbers from, the IMF lists Canada's GDP PPP at $44,843 US and Romania's at $19,712 (source), but even if the numbers you listed are real and the average person's purchasing power is 5.77 times bigger in Canada, the prices we pay are still huge.   The problem is not that I can't get gigabit internet for $18, the problem is that I can't get it for $104 ($90-ish without tax), which would be 5.77 times more than in Romania. You can get 250Mbps from Rogers for $94.99 + tax ($69.99 for the first three months), so a gigabit connection would still cost 4 times as much if we compared apples to apples and purchasing powers 1:1."

toronto,3di001,Mr44,-20,Thu Jul 16 17:30:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not defensive.  I'm just tired of people whining about how cheap the Internet is in <insert some other country here> which, more than likely, has many other factors at play that don't apply to Canada.  Everything, not just Internet access,  is generally more expensive here due to our small market, low population density (which makes shipping and supply-chain logistics more costly,) our dollar's historically low exchange rate vs. the US dollar (guess which currency network hardware is priced in?), higher taxes (but then we have the social programs such as medicare that they fund) and so on."
toronto,3di001,CuntWeasel,17,Thu Jul 16 15:50:07 2015 UTC,"You might be right with some things being more expensive for various reasons (such as the US dollar being stronger), but the main reason why telecommunications are so expensive in Canada is not the low exchange rate, but the oligopoly that exists in the telecom industry here.  While taxes in Canada are certainly higher than in most US states, they are considerably lower than in most of Europe and social programs also exist across the pond (most countries over there also have free post-secondary education and a lot of them include dental in their free healthcare) so I don't see how this would be the reasoning behind the high prices we pay for internet access."
toronto,3di001,Fearltself,12,Thu Jul 16 15:57:50 2015 UTC,"Everything you just listed is not the real reason. Low population density? Ok, that means internet should be expensive in remote areas but dirt cheap in Southern Ontario because it's dense.   The real reason is the same reason why our cell phone bills are insane compared to other countries. A government protected oligopoly which prevents outside investment and prevents competition, competition necessarily lowers prices."

Poor countries are expansive due to lack of infrastructure often, and Canada is because of lack of competition, supported by government which is paid off by the ""big 3"". But Canada being a socialist country justifies it, the whole economy is artificial and overinflated, but miraculously works! It's one of if not the only country where socialism actually works!"

This means it's a measurement of ""speed"" or the rate at which x travels.  The mistake is just ISP double-talk because calling anything a ""usage cap"" can't be marketed very well and is in turn replaced with an improperly use techie buzz word."
toronto,3di001,Redshirt_Down,-4,Thu Jul 16 17:36:45 2015 UTC,AFAIK we pay more because of the gigantic infrastructure costs to get Canada connected to the internet... Remember big country and relatively small population should explain the high cost.

toronto,3di001,Montpre,4,Fri Jul 17 04:58:14 2015 UTC,Also that argument doesn't hold water when the government (ie: taxpayers) are the ones that subsidized the majority of the infrastructure costs years ago.

toronto,3di001,CuntWeasel,-8,Thu Jul 16 20:06:16 2015 UTC,"It all has to do with infrastructure development costs. People in metro areas can pay the low rates IF AND ONLY IF they are fine with people in rural areas (norther prairies, etc) paying 10x the amount to cover the costs of infrastructure to get the service to their location. Otherwise, the cost will be spread out across all subscribers.  Canada is a BIG country. Deal with it."

There's a few Canadian rappers with K-sounding names, so you could see why he'd make that assumption.  I'm pretty sure John Tory knows who Drake is.

We are mostly orderly, reasonable and well organized despite many things that disagree directly with that statement.   I don't think many people here wish ill on these games, and it is being run well but the constant complaints are mostly regarding how over hyped these have been, the traffic chaos, and the general dislike of having to pay more potential taxes to pay this off effects us all directly.

Then goes on to use data that says spending overall is up. feels like they were trying to shoehorn a narrative in and found a few places that fit the story they wanted.   overall just a really odd article.

With current technology, it's impossible to accurately track the movements of tens of thousands of people to that extent, unless you're implanting RFID chips under our skin or something. Sure they can catch the worst offenders, who show up every day, or get there before stores open, but I've parked at Yorkdale and taken the subway numerous times, and I've never even got a warning ticket.

That would be way too much data to keep track of and even trying would be a vast waste of time.  The worst offenders are caught, and this is the easy part. Moderate offenders are sometimes caught, but can certainly get away with it.  Our only intention is to ensure that our privately owned parking lot is used to allow customers to use our mall, and the majority solution works. Essentially, if our customers aren't experiencing issues because of non-customers using the parking lot, we have no reason to further our efforts to prevent commuter parking. It is still prohibited, but we just don't want our customers having trouble.  We continually work to improve our methods, make them less inconvenient for our customers, and ensure transparency for everyone.

There are admins, backup teams, security teams and other groups who will have access to this data, no matter your policy - people will have access.    With that being the case, why is it so important to track and store data on the driver of a vehicle?"
toronto,3dkjko,noel_105,4,Fri Jul 17 01:57:39 2015 UTC,"Market research and trend tracking. This kinda of data, how often someone visits, what time they come at, how long they spend, is invaluable for important business decisions, future planning, etc. Yes, it is slightly sketchy but from a business stand point it's very smart."
toronto,3dkjko,kitten_anus,0,Fri Jul 17 02:47:18 2015 UTC,"To clarify, access to the individual profiles of the shoppers is restricted very heavily. Nobody can look at any faces at any time, and your movement isn't being tracked. Faces aren't being stored, simply the plate numbers, which are recorded probably 100 times you go out driving anyway. Each time a car parks, a person is associated with it, and when they leave, the facial data is deleted."
toronto,3dkjko,4ray,2,Fri Jul 17 05:00:23 2015 UTC,Faces aren't being stored     From your other comment:     The facial recognition simply scans at timed intervals to check if drivers are present on the property     These 2 statement seem to be in direct conflict with each other.
toronto,3dkjko,deepfunkysoul,-1,Fri Jul 17 11:30:11 2015 UTC,"As soon as a driver leaves the property, their facial data is deleted. We check while they are on the property only."

toronto,3dkjko,maximumtaco,0,Fri Jul 17 04:55:29 2015 UTC,"Our priority with this measure is to ensure people can park and those that leave the property are warned and fined if they keep doing it.  This information is used solely for parking and is promptly deleted when the drivers of the parked cars (the only faces recorded) leave with their car. Patrons who are passengers in cars, arrive in the subway, are dropped off, or otherwise get to the mall are not recorded with the facial recognition.

toronto,3dkjko,PassThePoutine,3,Fri Jul 17 14:46:26 2015 UTC,"We get that this sucks, yes. But since we started doing it we've noticed a DRAMATIC increase in parking availability. In total we've deterred over 1000 cars in the past three days who had no idea they couldn't park at Yorkdale for the subway. This isn't counting people who don't need directions to Wilson/Downsview with maps we're handing out.  I personally have some shifts doing this, and it sucks for us as well.  We stay courteous and prompt to the best of our ability while standing on concrete in the blistering sun and rain directing traffic for 12 hours. I personally smile at every car I stop and do my best to stay happy.  Also, stemming the flow of entrance traffic dramatically decreases traffic inside the parking lot, making is easy to drive around and find parking (EDIT: and safer for pedestrians and guards directing traffic, we often get hit by cars who don't slow down or stop)."

Essentially we scan at certain intervals for the drivers of the parked cars(excluding employees, subway/GO commuters, and car passengers), and if any car is missing a driver for more than a couple scans we are given an automatic alert."

toronto,3dkjko,Trauma17,2,Fri Jul 17 15:19:16 2015 UTC,It would have been believable had you said there's a database of licence plates and their arrivals and departures and left it at that. Facial recognition software is used in casinos and stadiums but there are too many variables for it to work as intended at a mall. And I doubt any landlord is going to make that kind of investment so that mall cops can issue parking tickets. If you do work for Oxford what do you think they will say if someone in the media who reads this sub asks them about the claims being made by an employee?

toronto,3dkjko,TheTigerMaster,3,Fri Jul 17 03:46:58 2015 UTC,The problem with facial recognition is that people's faces/identities are tracked and stored in a database. CCTV is simply a tool that is used after the fact for crimes or other incidents.

toronto,3dkmie,vinng86,12,Fri Jul 17 02:54:30 2015 UTC,This image is way better. Your filters added a heck of a lot of grain. Try bumping the contrast a little and raise the shadows (hope you shot in RAW).  Is it me or does it look like the image is divided into two? There's a line of different blurriness along the first 1/3rd of the image from the left.

toronto,3dkmie,vinng86,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:52:23 2015 UTC,I don't post process these in Lightroom or Photoshop. Admittedly just add the HDR filter via an app called Snapseed. You recommend any photo editing apps?
toronto,3dkmie,electricalgypsy,4,Fri Jul 17 04:02:43 2015 UTC,"I use Lightroom mostly, it's really the goto program for post-processing. The filters in most apps seriously suck or they're too generic such that you can't apply them to every image and expect good results.  It's better to import into Lightroom, and adjust the Highlights/Shadows/Whites/Blacks so that your image has enough contrast while the dark areas aren't totally pitch black (nor the white areas pure white). I recommend shooting in RAW for this, even though it takes 4-5x as much space. It makes a huge difference in adjusting the picture because it stores lots more data. There's also a million other features Lightroom has (such as reverting distortion caused by lenses) that are extremely useful too.  I would just recommend getting Lightroom (legally or illegally). Adobe has a subscription based service for $10/mo which gets you both Photoshop and Lightroom + their mobile apps."

Call me old fashioned - and regardless of the fact that I have 0 respect for his music (?) and lyrics - but at least, at the very least of self respect I do expect some degree of decency and clear artistic distinction.  I think the whole issue came from the fact that PanAm Games are somewhat of a uniting event to which many segments of music fans subscribe to and expect something from and having him as a headline - again, my view - is seen as sort of a stain.

toronto,3djpij,Sk4ld,-4,Thu Jul 16 22:40:26 2015 UTC,How is it that you relate to a song about the hardships of having too much money and fame?  How is it intended to represent a competition where most of the participants are amateurs who are likely to be putting their athletic achievements ahead of monetary gain?

Regardless of what happens with the course, we want an independent investigation into what allowed this course to be approved, and for UofT to put measures into place to ensure nothing like this happens again. Our concerns over this issue were related to the importance of evidence-based medical education, and to advocate for accountability when teaching about topics that affect the health care of the Canadian people.

No deals, no groupons, no upgrades. $500 and they sell out like crazy - so you'd likely not even get one next week (but maybe). I booked 8 months ahead.

If he wants to stay in the shade and comfort, then 3rd base 200 level is good. They cost about $80 each.  You can get them even cheaper if you buy from stubhub, say, 30 minutes before the actual game."
toronto,3dovzu,beef-supreme,2,Sat Jul 18 02:03:59 2015 UTC,The rooms that face the game are premium rate btw. They were going for $400 plus in 2012.
toronto,3dovzu,Grubers_Mullet,2,Sat Jul 18 01:46:07 2015 UTC,"They are nice rooms and can be fun. Have done one during the week last year and it was $550 I believe and that was even discounted because of a preferred member that booked the room. We also booked on a weekend and that was around $800. Also keep in mind that there is a big difference between some of the filed facing rooms depending on level. Another issue sometimes is the noise of work being done overnight which can get annoying if anyone is a light sleeper. That being said if you are a huge fan even being in the dome during game day prep and take down after the game is kind of neat. However, on a budget it is not worth it at all in my opinion. You could get him in the action seats for the kind of money you would be dropping that would be incredible. I would advise to call the hotel as the staff there are really amazing and can give you an estimate based on previous years and occupancy.. There are deals to be had if it's a weeknight non-premium game but would have to be a relative short notice booking like a day in advance of the game I believe. That's just my experience anyway."

I've seen some sad looking folk shuffling around the parking lot panhandling, and the odd loud argument (again in the parking lot) but thats about it. Nothing to worry about.  The area is the closest thing to a rent/value sweet spot in the city as you're likely to find.

So, I am not to sure rogers is behind this. It more likely just the nature of any larger telecommunications company.

toronto,3dmhps,halo46,4,Fri Jul 17 13:57:26 2015 UTC,"The ""big deal"" is that lefties and statists are typically anti-gun, and anti-self-defense in general. They want people helpless and dependent on government for everything, so the idea of a man taking responsibility for protecting his own life against a lethal assault is abhorrent to them.  Any incident where a good guy with a gun actually prevails undermines their narrative that firearms are inherently evil, and that only the police and military can be trusted with them."

toronto,3dis08,toronto34,19,Thu Jul 16 16:38:22 2015 UTC,IMHO they should hold a book amnesty and allow people to return books penalty free once every three years or something.

toronto,3dm6ru,ladieslovetheflowehh,11,Fri Jul 17 13:04:44 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but the same logic can also be applied to women walking home late. If you're wearing skimpy clothes it's easier to get raped, so be on guard!   Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  Okay, so you need to knock this shit off, right now.  The problem with victim-blaming in the specific context of sexual assault is really threefold:  Firstly, ""stranger rape"" is actually not the most common type of sexual assault. When we get all puffed up on telling women how to behave at nightclubs, we ignore the fact that the most common rapists of women are their friends, coworkers, bosses, husbands, relatives, neighbours, doctors, and other men who are otherwise ""known"" to them, who often assault them in ""safe"" settings. These comprise about 75% of all sexual assaults upon women, and fixating on dark alleys and drugged cocktails has the effect of leaving women completely unequipped to address the much bigger threat.  Secondly, even when we talk about stranger rape, this morality advice is pretty fucking twisted. When it comes to any piece of advice in the form ""drink less"" or ""don't dress so slutty"", we can usually append ""...so the rapist picks someone else instead"". When you give this type of advice, you don't actually help to eliminate or prevent rape, you just equip individual women to make themselves harder targets while passing the problem onto others. This suggests that people who give the advice are less concerned with preventing rape and more concerned with trivializing, minimizing and -- frankly -- humiliating its victims.  Thirdly, if it were the case that manner of dress, flirtatiousness, stumbling down dark alleys, etc. were prominent causal factors in rape -- prominent enough to merit constant warnings, addressed to all women -- why do people rape 90-year-olds? Why do people rape 12-year-olds? Why do people rape 50something women who are just coming home from work? Why do people rape women who wear a head-to-toe veil?  Your answer may well be ""Well, some people have kinks for these things: some people are just really into niqabs, or 12-year-olds, or women dressed for a day at the office"", but this still completely undercuts the argument. If not even a 90-year-old woman sitting at home is safe from rape, how can we possibly try to prevent rape by giving morality advice? ""Sorry, granny, maybe you could buy your compression stockings in a less slutty shade next time""?    But does it follow from all of this that victim-blaming is uniformly a bad practice? That victims are never at fault?  Well, no.  If you, say, ignore a ""CAUTION: DO NOT ENTER"" sign and walk right into a car crusher, that's your own damn fault. Ditto for jumping into the lion pen at the zoo, or trying to walk through a subway tunnel, or hanging onto the top of a minivan while your friends do donuts on a frozen lake.  In these situations, blaming you for your consequences is proportionate and fair. If you had taken certain reasonable precautions, you would have prevented these situations entirely: unlike the rapist, it's not as if the car crusher will just move onto someone else and begin chasing them instead.  It's also important to contextualize this advice.  If women followed all of the morality advice people give them in order to ""prevent rape"", they would live communally, dozens of women in a single house, no men allowed; they would dress only in burlap from head to toe, with slits for their eyes; they would drink only orange juice and listen only to whalesong, because heaven forbid that heathen Ragtime or Cool Jazz give anyone an erotic idea, and don't get me started on the potential consequences of listening to Brahms or -- perish the thought -- Beethoven!  Conversely, what does a world where people obey ""CAUTION: DO NOT ENTER"" signs look like?  It looks exactly like the world we already inhabit. Nobody's behaviour or conduct is unduly restricted, and nobody is denied access to or enjoyment of anything. (Unless you enjoy car crushers, but that's surely a pretty niche interest.)  In this case, wearing all-black clothing after dark? Yes, you're putting yourself in danger -- and choosing to dress in any other colour (or slipping on a reflective armband, or -- hell -- wearing a chain wallet which reflects some light) would demonstrably and significantly reduce your risk of injury. The advice is useful and effective and does not place an undue burden upon you. It's fair play."

toronto,3dhyfz,GSODT,2,Thu Jul 16 20:39:02 2015 UTC,"Man, that is scary.   We laughed cause we thought he was joking   Funny though.. I moved near Front/Sherbourne last year, and my roommate casual told me ""Oh, btw, you shouldn't go north past, like, Richmond.""  He said it so casually that I didn't take it in. Well, I went for a walk north to around Moss Park. Walking past dozens of people, not one of them 'normal'.. then it hit me: he was being dead serious and this is why."

toronto,3dhyfz,myrevenge,3,Thu Jul 16 14:51:46 2015 UTC,"That area is basically a free-for-all. By containing it to that area and not arresting people, it effectively allows the TPS to provide the APPEARANCE that everything is fine. What happens in the area ultimately doesn't become a matter of public record, thereby keeping crime stats and the cost of policing low."
toronto,3dhyfz,joshuawakefield,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:30:35 2015 UTC,Guess our cops never watched The Wire. The free zones never work.
toronto,3dhyfz,zola_zola,2,Thu Jul 16 15:15:00 2015 UTC,Is this true or just kind of a theory? honest question- I live nearby on Parliament. I'd be interested in hearing more...
toronto,3dhyfz,myrevenge,3,Thu Jul 16 15:24:24 2015 UTC,"It's more a theory. By most measures this area is still the most heavily policed and produces the most charges across the board. http://www.cbc.ca/toronto/features/crimemap/  That being said, you don't need to spend too  long in the area to see the police turn a blind eye. Arguably they have ""better"" things to be doing in the area and are choosing their battles."
toronto,3dhyfz,dave_68,3,Thu Jul 16 16:00:37 2015 UTC,Walking down the street in that area at night I had a guy showing me his drugs and trying to get me to buy some. He was a annoyingly aggressive so I told a cop that was parked less than a block away. The cop didn't even drive over.
toronto,3dhyfz,myrevenge,6,Thu Jul 16 16:22:17 2015 UTC,Haha ya. That sounds about right.
toronto,3dhyfz,zola_zola,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:50:30 2015 UTC,"very interesting, but I don't see the link between the place being a ""free for all"" and, at the same time, being the most heavily policed area. Those assertions seem to be at odds.   But yeah I totally get Cops choosing their battles though. I mean, something that would get you arrested in Rosedale might not at Sherbourne and Dundas.   I suppose they have to think practically of what they can actually accomplish in the area."

toronto,3dhyfz,RomulusJ,0,Fri Jul 17 02:21:19 2015 UTC,Cost of policing low.  Bwahaha
toronto,3dhyfz,bekbob,2,Thu Jul 16 14:46:24 2015 UTC,Yep. This is pretty much an open air drug market. It might be best to avoid confrontation with dude with a horn habit and invest in a better bike lock.
toronto,3dhyfz,tidder112,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:10:33 2015 UTC,taking the law into your own hands rarely works out well.
toronto,3dhyfz,x3nomik,2,Fri Jul 17 04:33:05 2015 UTC,"Can we please increase the punishment for bike thieves?  They should be placed on a registry so future employers and future meetings with this person all start with the knowledge that this person has stolen someone else's bicycle.  That way the decision can be made right away that you should avoid contact with this person as they are inhumane, sociopathic, monster.  If I weren't against the death penalty, the first people to be executed would be convicted bike thieves.  Until then, they should be exiled to Yellowknife, where there are no bikes."
toronto,3dhyfz,tidder112,2,Thu Jul 16 22:05:15 2015 UTC,That's one way to churn out more career criminals.

toronto,3dhyfz,wtfarenalbs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:39:59 2015 UTC,"what happens is they steal bikes that are locked by the front wheel, so they're constantly in need of front wheels. Others are locked by the frame, leaving the front wheel unsecured, so they steal the front wheels and keep them until they find a full bike. Then they put the front wheel and stolen bike together and sell it."
toronto,3dm662,ellipsesdotdotdot,6,Fri Jul 17 11:51:21 2015 UTC,Anyone live near the area? What are your thoughts?
toronto,3dm662,pennerat,6,Fri Jul 17 11:51:45 2015 UTC,"Not bad at all, but I can see what they mean.  My unit faces out over the tracks... Go and Via train locomotives can't be heard from inside (especially with the fan on), but I can hear the damn bell every morning when they come in clusters.  The fan can drown most of it out no problem, but the bell can sometimes cut through it... it's real loud.  Having said that, I'm used to it and sort of like watching the trains go by.  It's never bothered me in the slightest.  A more cynical person might not be unjustified for thinking differently."
toronto,3dm662,1slinkydink1,4,Fri Jul 17 13:42:59 2015 UTC,"I posted an article on the same thing yesterday. Luckily we're far enough/insulated by some buildings along the corridor that it doesn't bother us as much but with windows open, it is pretty loud and, as it says in the article, pretty much non-stop all day."
toronto,3dm662,striketwo,3,Fri Jul 17 11:58:40 2015 UTC,"It's pretty annoying, especially at night when there's no other city noise. Not the worst thing in the world, but in order to sleep I need to either use ear plugs or close my window. Several times louder than GO trains. I won't be standing in front of anything with my arms crossed but I'm hoping that it gets less intrusive once construction stops."
toronto,3dm662,ThreeMissedCalls,4,Fri Jul 17 15:15:51 2015 UTC,"It's not that bad. I've lived across the street from the tracks for years and like the sounds of trains. The UPX trains are far quieter than I expected (the big-bad-smelly-noisy-diesel campaign led me to believe otherwise) and I enjoy seeing them roll by. Every once in a while you get a train that seems like its been ringing its bells from St. Clair on down, but for the most part it's easy enough it ignore. It's not dramatically different from living near a busy city intersection with streetcar bells, sirens, and general street nonsense, though it is noisier than it was pre-UPX."
toronto,3dm662,adoptedCanadIAN,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:22:05 2015 UTC,"I live about a minute away by walking. I've lived here over 12 years and I've barely noticed a thing. The GO train makes just as much noise, and it hasn't bothered me. The bells aren't that loud either.   It seems like another typical case of old people complaining about an issue that doesn't exist.  edit: 7:10 PM, in my quiet room and it just passed by. It's definitely noticeable, but I paid close attention and it still does not seem to be any louder than a GO train horn, which has passed by here for years. Not very disturbing."
toronto,3dm662,1slinkydink1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:27:33 2015 UTC,How can you discount everyone's experiences so callously? People experience things differently than you do.
toronto,3dm662,adoptedCanadIAN,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:26:03 2015 UTC,"I realize that, however every day the GO train speeds by and it's very loud, and very noticeable. The UPX, although loud, is not louder. Irritating? Yeah, a bit. But to complain now after all these years of the GO train is ridiculous."
toronto,3dm662,1slinkydink1,3,Fri Jul 17 15:50:31 2015 UTC,"Did you read the article? Do you even understand the concern? How close are you to either Bloor or Weston station? This isn't about the noise of the train, this is about the ringing of the bell nearly all hours of the day that is bothering some people. You saying that the ringing of the bell isn't louder than the GO Train tells me that you have a very different experience of the rail line than many others."
toronto,3dm662,adoptedCanadIAN,0,Fri Jul 17 15:53:11 2015 UTC,"Yes I read the article. And I live less than a minute's walk away from the Wallace street bridge. The ringing of the bell is a bit annoying but it is not as loud as people make it out to be.   Also to clarify, if you don't know what the Wallace Street Bridge is, that's the bridge that the men in the article are standing on."
toronto,3dm662,1slinkydink1,2,Fri Jul 17 15:55:33 2015 UTC,Oh! Is that what they call the bridge that I see when I open my front door? Thanks!
toronto,3dm662,adoptedCanadIAN,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:12:28 2015 UTC,"Not sure if sarcasm? But yeah it's a bit of a strange name, didn't know about it until about 2 years ago. I just called it the black bridge."
toronto,3dm662,1slinkydink1,2,Fri Jul 17 16:15:06 2015 UTC,I thought that you were questioning my local knowledge.  Why is it a strange name? Wallace Avenue Foot Bridge connects Wallace Avenue to Dundas.
toronto,3dm662,adoptedCanadIAN,0,Fri Jul 17 16:43:24 2015 UTC,"I thought it would have a name that isn't associated with a street name, especially since Wallace isn't a well-known street. Doesn't really matter though."
toronto,3dm662,TFC1234,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:30:57 2015 UTC,I'm on Wallace but east of Symington so I only hear it when the windows are open. This is very MINOR compared to the superbridge that will be going through the neighbourhood soon...if you haven't heard of this just google  Davenport Diamond Separation. It's brutal.
toronto,3dm662,Llemondifficult,3,Fri Jul 17 14:44:02 2015 UTC,"For the ""they should have know they live next to the train tracks"" comments, it isn't the sound of the trains: it is the bells.   I'm sure that you're used to the sound of cars driving on your street (you should have know the road was there when you moved in).  Now, if every car that drove on your street honked their horn when they went by your house you might get annoyed."
toronto,3dm662,1slinkydink1,3,Fri Jul 17 13:29:33 2015 UTC,"I'm getting my ""honk if you like bewbs"" sign ready and camping out in front of every ""should'a known better"" users house."
toronto,3dm662,alovelymorning,3,Fri Jul 17 15:27:18 2015 UTC,"My bedroom window is about 25m from the UPX, though not in the Junction. Windows closed, we don't really hear a thing and they aren't bothersome compared to the Go Trains. However, I can definitely see the bells being much more of a nuisance than the UPX trains themselves."

toronto,3dm662,art_738292,-6,Fri Jul 17 16:28:24 2015 UTC,wait .. you buy a place near train tracks and you're complaining about noise?
toronto,3dm662,REDDIT_IN_MOTION,12,Fri Jul 17 12:04:15 2015 UTC,"Sounds like they are complaining about the noise being heard between 1am and 5:30 am, when train noise was never during that time before  If that sounds unreasonable to you, I don't know what to tell ya."
toronto,3dm662,1slinkydink1,5,Fri Jul 17 12:06:09 2015 UTC,Yup. The comments on reddit for the article that I posted yesterday were filled with this same vitriol. This isn't frivolous complaining. This isn't someone who just moved into their condo and didn't realize that the Gardiner is loud or something.
toronto,3dm662,impactanalyst,2,Fri Jul 17 12:12:00 2015 UTC,"Not quite. The trains run from 5:30 to 1... however,  the trains must honk their horns before they get to Bloor station so as to warn any construction workers that may be on the track. This is what the concern is. With only Go trains before, this only happened in AM and PM rush hours, now it is  20 hours a day."
toronto,3dm662,art_738292,-4,Fri Jul 17 14:00:52 2015 UTC,If you buy a place near the train tracks expect trains.
