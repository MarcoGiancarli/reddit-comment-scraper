If you move there post-summer tourist season, you can probably get a good rate on a few hotels that are looking to fill empty spaces. In the summer, they still charge quite a bit.  Milk is a tad more than Anchorage, but pretty average. Boring as shit in the winter, food portions are huge at restaurants, there is at least one brew-pub on the penninsula now.  Little known fact: online ordering up to alaska as a general whole is not as easy as one would think. There are those online vendors who actually will not ship to AK, despite the fact that USPS, UPS and FedEx are commonplace. So if you have specialized 'needs,' make sure that your left handed little people porn vendor ships up there, or have friends receive it down in the states, and put it in the flat rate priority shipping box for you.

alaska,3dvzci,dkman22,2,Mon Jul 20 21:58:08 2015 UTC,"When I moved to Alaska 16 years ago, I arrived at the start of summer, and I had decided beforehand I would camp out for a couple of weeks and look for an apartment during that time.  I put my stuff in a storage space, got a PO box, and every night after work I'd head out of town and pitch a tent in the bed of my truck.  It was so peaceful and I enjoyed it so much, I quit worrying about finding a place right away.  On my days off I'd head out exploring and go fishing.  I was out there for about 6 weeks before I bit the bullet and started actively looking for a place.  There's a laundromat in Sterling where you can take showers.  Best time to look for an apartment in Alaska is when the tourist season ends at the end of August.  The tourists and tourist industry workers all fly south, and all of the sudden Craigslist explodes."

We have a family cabin in Soldotna and love the summers, spend every other weekend down there, but in the winters we have to push ourselves to drive down from Anchorage just to check on the place. I would recommend bi monthly trips up to Anchorage to go to Costco and stock up, it will save you a bundle on groceries and such."

One idiot went off and killed his family and their pets before killing himself.   There was a massive search for the family and a missing persons case for about a year.   Before the family's remains were found (the year long missing persons case) and the murder/suicide motive figured out, the locals came up with alllllll kinds of crazy theories on what happen to the family, from mafia hit to drug deal gone bad, even alien abduction (seriously lol.)   It's a big deal locally because something like that hasn't happened here before, but people here make it sound like this one incident is the beginning of the end, like somehow that's going to become the norm since it happened once."

Roads in kenai are good; there are only a couple of highways, so expect traffic. If you're allergic to spruce trees or cottonwood trees, good luck. Bring Benedryl. Lots. If you like cleaning, you're in luck: we have lots of construction and dust from hundreds of miles of dirt roads to keep you busy. Internet is expensive, but every other business has free wifi. And forget freeloading your neighbor's wifi; we encrypt everything here. Walmart, Safeway, & Fred Myers are the 3 big box stores here; prepare yourself for sticker shock; avocadoes are $2 each, a six pack of beer, around $8-10. Research some of the realty co.'s locally to find out what's available in your preferred neighborhood. A warm winter is predicted this year, so the moose munching on your rose bushes won't be much of a problem. And your Amazon orders will eventually arrive, often intact, in a week or two, provided the passes aren't snowed in again and the mail carriers' huskies are rested and well-fed. And don't be concerned about our four active volcanoes here; heck, Mt. Spurr hasn't erupted since '92, and that only shut things down for 3 or 4 days. If you have a week's supply of dry and canned food (who doesn't?), candles, a propane space heater, lights and batteries, and a CB radio, you'll be fine. :)"

Vehicles are rather pricy here. I would recommend a spare battery/ vehicle pulg-in to keep your vehicle from freezing in the winter.   Gas was $3.31 today in Girdwood (South of Anchorage).

alaska,3dvp62,MidwesternNative,7,Sun Jul 19 22:39:26 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, Alaska is not a winter wonder land. It can be cold, lonely and dangerous. On the other hand it can be a great place to live, depending on what you're willing to put up with.   Living far away from family sucks. Probably 1/4th of my income goes to traveling. Not only to see family but after a while you just need to get out of here. It's a huge state but can make you feel claustrophobic.   Depends on what you want to do. You'll have better luck finding a welding job up north or in one of our mines. Jobs aren't particularly hard to find. We also have a ton of government jobs available.   No. Prices are relatively the same.   Biggest con for me? It's expensive. It's expensive to rent (at least in Juneau) and it costs me hundreds of dollars minimum to fly anywhere. I've lived in Alaska most of my life and the cost of living here has always been the biggest negative for me."

Some towns are very boxed in by federal and state land, leaving little land for development. Depending on which part of Alaska you go to, you might be lucky to have even a quarter-acre lot.  My point is that a lot of the outdoor space is shared, and in a lot of towns you can feel like you're right on top of your neighbors.     Family; I would be moving insanely far away from them, and don't know how that would affect our relationships   It depends how much money you make, how much time off you have, and how much you like to travel.  It's very expensive to go that far.  My parents both made similar moves and while I was growing up it was typical for me to go 2-5 years between visiting grandparents or cousins.   It was even rarer yet for relatives to come visit us - probably 5-10 years between trips for them.  Biggest con?  For me it is the annual cabin fever.  Sometimes I just need to get the heck out of town.  That gets complicated and expensive.  I feel like there are times - say in November before Thanksgiving - when EVERYONE around me is grumpy."

That way when you come across something you'll be slightly surprised and not completely disappointed.  Here's a basic list of Anchorage's paltry antique stores. Most any truly antique items you'll find up here were most likely brought up from elsewhere. Some friends and family of mine make a point to leave Alaska when they really want to go antique shopping because there just isn't anything up here.  Sure, you might find some old mining equipment, but those ""buckets"" are solid iron. It's not like you can just pop one in a carry-on and jaunt back home with it."

The original intention behind the flag was to honor confederate soldiers (it was adopted at the end of the war) but the Dixiecrats were inspired by this flag to use the confederate battle flag as their symbol protesting integration and civil rights. Mississippi was at the forefront of that battle. (They sure know how to pick a side, don't they?)  Now this particular flag is part of a group of citizen's attempts to make Juneau more welcoming. These flags are not linked to an official state or local department. They are a community effort, and get permission to fly the flags. No government time is wasted on these flags, except to issue permits to put them up and take them down each year, and as needed for repairs.  All that said, I think they should have left it alone. It is the official flag. It's been in use since the Civil War. We can just do what we always do, which is scrunch up our noses and wonder how Mississippi can be so backward."

alaska,3dny73,Soldat_Wesner,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:01:26 2015 UTC,"We are not talking about the soldiers or the flag of St. George.  Frankly, whatever flag you want to fly on your truck or car or house is your business. It's your right. However, when flags are being flown on public property with symbols that LARGELY represent racism and slavery, this is not ok. This alienates and insults part of the citizenry that support and have a right to that public property. That is the issue here. I'm not advocating outlawing the flag on private property; that would be unconstitutional. For all those soldiers that died defending that flag? I would say they fall in similar circumstances with the Nazi soldiers. It was wrong and the reasons were wrong. I'm sorry they were born on that side of the Mason-Dixon line."

She was flying out for the summer but on her camera she had a few pictures taken from the air of what looked like your stereotypical bigfoot walking around out on the tundra.

alaska,3doswg,bamdastard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:57:42 2015 UTC,"I spend a lot of time staying in cabins accessible only by boat in Prince William Sound. like most weekends during the summer for the past 10 years. I'm going to be 33 this month and I've lived here my entire life.  For shits every once and a while out I like to have a beer or two and walk around in the old growth rain forest alone. Waaaaay out in the middle of nowhere at night imagining that I'm bigfoot.  Trying to move silently through the skunk cabbage in the dim twilight of the summer beneath the old growth canopy following game trails for miles mimicking animal noises as I hear them. in many places there is not much ground vegetation so it feels like walking around an ancient abandoned forest of columns the size of those found at the acropolis. At times like this this I feel like  an Apex predictor with a big gun who could not be threatened.  I like to whimsically think that Bigfoot and I could be bros. We could creep around the woods doing bigfoot stuff together.  sometimes when I feel the moment  is right and I'm boisterous enough I'll make a bigfoot call.    I swear I heard a response once.   When that happened even the wind seemed to stop. I have never gone from feeling so confident to feeling the icy grip of terror clench down on my heart in an instant.  It was like all my veins and arteries were filled with icicles and I instantly broke out into a cold sweat.  My heart was beating so hard I could feel it throbbing in my eardrums and I could hear nothing else.  I have never been gripped with such abject terror anywhere but in the most horrifying of nightmares. Half my brain was telling me to bolt as fast as I could and the other half was telling me to remain absolutely still and not breathe.the trees seemed more imposing after that, like the bay was a leviathan, the trees baleen and I the plankton. I was about to be swallowed up. The closest analogy is those nightmares where you are unable to move while some unspeakable horror descends upon you.  I remained absolutely frozen for probably about five minutes.    I had totally pussed out. and I skulked back to the cabin as quickly as possible. in that embarassed frightened jog without breaking into an outright full sprint. I kinda feel silly about it sometimes.   I tried to tell myself that it must be my dad messing with me, I was at least a mile from the cabin though and everyone else sound asleep when I left. It was definitely not an echo either, because I'm out there hooting and hollering all the time without hearing them.   We were easily more than 30 miles over mountains from the closest road or town.  Of course it could have been anything. and it hasn't stopped me from taking my nature walks slightly under the influence. It also might have been someone on a boat out in the bay. That's probably the most likely source.   edit: Google maps link"

Buy non-perishables (ie rice, quinoa, flower) in bulk while in Fairbanks and bring with on your flight out. The perishables you do buy should be able to last a while without spoiling (ie carrots, cabbage, apples). If you have access to a freezer you can bring pretty much anything you want.  Fresh stuff is going to cost you but if you are only going to be in Barrow just for the summer I can't see it being too bad. Summer is half over."

Any particular recommendations for milk (in any form)?   given the time of year, I like /u/coreyshep's answer regarding dried milk that your friend can reconstitute.

The best parallel I can draw is to a major forward operating base in the middle east -- yeah, you can get stuff but the supply is limited, it's not the freshest, and you may not like the price or selection.  We're not major milk drinkers, but I did go ahead and follow coreyshep's suggestion for Nido Fortificada.

Check if you overlap with any of the farmer's markets (there's one downtown on the weekends, and one at a mall in midtown a couple of days a week) for fresh produce.  Fresh spices might be a good idea - these also can be air dried in Kotz if you don't use them all so they won't go to waste. For butchery products, Natural Pantry has a rather wide range of those, some fairly exotic.

Fred Meyer is cheaper than Carrs but also further away. (closest one to Spenard is probably the one at Benson and New Seward Highway, about 2-3 miles east of you.)    While you're running around, the following food purveyors are worth considering for odds and ends sort of things:    Fire Island Bakery, corner of 14th and G downtown;   Downtown City Market (New Sagaya), corner of 13th and I downtown;   Summit Spice and Tea, on the SE corner of Denali and Benson Blvd in midtown;   Natural Pantry, at 36th and A.

I'm well aware that the money they bring in far surpasses whatever my community spends on signs helping them get around.  Your encounter with a disgruntled local is an example of a totally unacceptable way to talk to someone, tourist or not.  Tourism dollars are pretty sweet, I'm not going to argue that; it's pretty easy money and all you have to do is show off our awesome state to folks who were already excited to see it. Alaska sells itself.  But that's just it, Alaska sells itself and, sometimes, goes too far. In my community, the majority of us spend most of the beautiful months of the year playing host to countless thousands of strange faces, day in day out. At the end of the season, downtown all but dies and all the windows are boarded up until May. We barely were able to make a culture for tourists to come and see before our culture became tourism.   Do I really want to close the state and shut all the tourists out for the rest of the summer? Of course not.  Am I a little burnt out from answering questions that instead could have been answered by a few seconds of a visitor observing their surroundings? Am I slightly frustrated at times that traffic can be so slow and so bad in such a small town due to the massive influx of daily visitors? Well, yes, I am.  Was this post made totally as a joke to vent my petty frustrations that come from being blessed by all the visitors that bring oh so very much money into my town? You bet.

This is one of the few places where people use it reliably to get from point A to B.   As for the park you'll need to go the WAC (Wilderness Access Center) for about a 1-hour video talk about safety.  Then you'll pick, depending on availability a zone to go in.  Polychrome is popular and pretty.  And some zones are a bit more approachable than others.  The rule is you can't camp within a mile of the park road and you must be out of sight from the road - so consider that when picking a zone.  The WAC has a breakdown of each zone and they are super helpful.    Layers and prep for rain.  Weather changes on a dime, so bring stuff that can get wet.  You'll also likely have to cross a stream or two depending on which zone you roll into.   If you don't like the zone approach, I suggest the Old Denali Highway."

alaska,3cxjvk,ttubravesrock,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:25:06 2015 UTC,"If you are going to go to Glenallen, you might as well go to Valdez, because there is truly nothing in Glenallen, it's just a junction, there's a gas station and that's about it.  There's probably more to see and do if you drove up the parks highway instead of the glen highway.  I might instead spend the time doing the hatchers pass road from palmer to willow, as long as it's open, there was a fire recently, so it might be closed, but it's a lot of fun.  plenty of areas to get out and hike.  Then from willow you could take a short drive up to Montana creek and walk down to where it meets the Susitna river.  Or go a little further north from there and you will reach talkeetna, a cool little town that has a very nice lodge.  on clear days you get the best views of Denali.  If you drove a little further north than that you get to the Denali state park which is also really fun and interesting.  Basically if you drive up the Parks highway there is a lot more stuff to do, and you get to see Denali, as long as it's not clouded in.  If you take the glen all the way up, there's just not a whole lot going on."

The highways are 2 lanes and are very difficult to pass by a slow driver, and Americans actually follow the laws of the road pretty well. What we like visitors to do is just pull to the side when you see a pullout, and make sure to use the right lane in the few spots where there is a passing lane. The police can give tickets if you have 5 or more cars behind you but they have not been good at enforcing it.

The players are paid what the free market will support. When sports become less popular, demand will go down, ticket prices will go down, and salaries will go down accordingly.

The float out was pretty laid back, a couple little rapids at the beginning but then the main thing is just not running into root wads or dragging. The one hazard that could be kind of sketchy is a piece of the old railroad bridge a little ways after you go under the existing bridge, but it's pretty easy to avoid.  It's super pretty up there, we just camped on the shore and didn't hike up to the cabin but saw where it's at, I imagine the view up there is incredible.

For halibut charters you would have to drive about 4 hours or so down to homer, ninilchik or seward I think. Craft beers I don't drink but I have heard good things about this one in Kenai (which is 3 hours away from Anchorage.   http://kassiksbrew.com/  What you could do is come into anchorage on the 16th, the 17th would be for halibut/fishing, the 18th would be to Denali, then the 19th would be to fly out.

alaska,3cdecf,sandman441,3,Tue Jul 7 03:15:27 2015 UTC,"yeah Anchorage is definitely right in the middle of everything. Plus it is also the biggest city here. It's 3-4 hours from fishing and I want to say 4 or 5 hours from denali (haven't driven there in years so unsure how long it is). So it is right in the middle, it's just if you do go halibut fishing do you really want to drive the 4 hours to go there, then go fishing and then drive back for 4 hours all in one day.   You could keep a place in Anchorage then just fly to kenai and rent a car to drive to homer then drive it back and fly back. But you would miss a lot of sight seeing.   I think to Fairbanks you could do a train ride from Anchorage to Fairbanks or Denali and then back. Or do the train one way and then fly back. It just depends on really how much you want to drive, everything is spread out for the most part."

If you do catch any fish are you just going to ship them from where ever? If you have to bring them to Anchorage I could see that as a positive for a car.
alaska,3cdecf,dewkitt,2,Wed Jul 8 18:12:49 2015 UTC,"Not sure where you are from, but what you want to do is going to take a lot more time than three days, unless you can get a bunch of private flight charters. This state is huge and we only have a couple ways to get around road-wise. Just pick one thing you really want to do and go for it instead! Like if you are set on a halibut charter, find the charter first, and plan around it.   I live in Talkeetna so I'm preferential to this little town, but there are a ton of ""touristy"" things to do here, fishing charters, denali brewing company, flight seeing, river rafting, etc. It's pricey, just fair warning, but everything in Alaska is."
alaska,3cdecf,NotTomPettysGirl,2,Tue Jul 7 03:10:07 2015 UTC,"I gotcha. Not really into the touristy things unless they are actually worth it. However im coming from Florida, so fishing is probably first on my list, followed by a close small town bar and good people vs a great outdoors hiking sight/seeing trek"
alaska,3cdecf,Logicalpeace,2,Tue Jul 7 03:20:43 2015 UTC,"Definitely would consider more of the Kenai peninsula for activities, then. The fishing there is world class, and if you pass through Homer go to the Salty Dawg. Everyone gets a sweatshirt there. EVERYONE. hahaha :)"

My brother once caught a halibut so big and too active that we couldn't get it over the railing of the boat, which was about a 5 foot rise. My dad had to use his shotgun to get it to stop moving. My brother was about 13 or 14 at the time, and the fish almost weighed more than him.  That was in South East Alaska, I don't know how big they are up north though."

Someone caught a 100 Lb+ Halibut and they were trying to figure out how to get it into the boat when one of the passengers pulled a .44 mag leaned over the rail and pulled the trigger.  Scared the shit out of everyone but the kicker was either someone pushed him, or the boat rocked at the wrong time - well he shot the fish - but also hit the boat.  That was the end of that trip = we headed into the harbor as soon as the fish was on board."

Red Flag Alaska is a large-scale multi-national mock air war, but Exercise Distant Frontier in particular is an intense live-fire event where a squadron will drop their entire yearly allotment of live weaponry in a matter of days over Alaska’s vast air combat ranges. These weapons include laser guided bombs and AGM-65 “Maverick” missiles."

The plane used in the test where it was ""beat"" was the F-35 known as AF-02, one of the first F-35s made and it had old software limiting it's maneuverability, no 360 degree visual sensors and no low observable coating and no electronic counter measures.  Edit - Also the F-35 pilot was a transition pilot from an F-15E with less than 100 hours in the type and the F-16 instructor had over 1500 in his type"

alaska,3ccfac,Logicalpeace,3,Wed Jul 8 19:57:50 2015 UTC,"If you are bad with money the vices are most definitely more tempting, expensive and everywhere. But you can get a paid plane ticket to go process fish. Once you are there its easy to network and walk the dock while already having employment and a roof over your head. Work on the company docks and you get to meet the fishermen and learn how their trade works. I don't know much about the oil industry but I am sure somebody at a bar will and that's where you probably will be as well anyways. You can only fish and hike soo much before you just want a brew and to sit down after pulling 16 at the plant."
alaska,3ccfac,cobigguy,3,Mon Jul 6 21:39:46 2015 UTC,"If you're wanting to fish, then you want to start in South East Alaska. Up north is mostly the big leagues in the open ocean. SE is an archipelago, giving it much calmer waters.  If extremely hard work and good to great pay is your thing then you want to be on a seiner or a gillnetter.  A tender will be easier, but the pay isn't as good.  A troller can be easy work with great pay, but that makes those jobs hard to get. You usually have to have connections, or have your own boat. A lot of trollers just go alone.  If you go with a processing plant, and you don't have a management job, its probably a shit job for shittier pay.  I grew up in the fishing industry here, so feel free to ask any questions you may have.  There's a few other options as well, like crabbing, shrimping, or sea cucumber diving, but I'm not sure on how well they pay."

There is a ton of road construction traffic from Denali to Talkeetna though, and even more from Anchorage to Seward as well. Check the 511 webpage to see what construction and shutdowns are happening the day you go and maybe cancel one of your outings.

But then I saw that it barely lasted 24 hours, which makes the whole thing equivalent to a 13-year-old having a tantrum for 5 minutes before finally calming down and going to his room like he was told.   Oh well. I'll keep visiting and participating until it's just not worth my time- which is basically what everyone else is doing. Reddit might fizzle out, but something else will take its place. And when that happens, we'll still be inundated with questions about how can I move to Alaska and be totally self sufficient off the grid because its cool and I lived with my idiot cousin in Texas for 2 weeks once and he didn't have running water so I'm totally prepared."

alaska,3bnv1t,RecRedditor2,0,Tue Jun 30 23:43:00 2015 UTC,That's an awesome hike. I did it in and out one night after work a month or so ago. Made dinner at the lakes and then went back out. What sort of time did you do it in with packs? With a day pack and including water breaks and eating I did it in 3 hours and 45 mins. I felt it the next day.

alaska,3bpt80,farnsworth_esq,3,Thu Jul 2 03:06:24 2015 UTC,"I didn't go to the Edmonton Mall, but passed through Edmonton a few years ago.  It went something like this:  Fairbanks to Whitehorse. ~12 hours. There is a huge chunk of road between Delta and Tok that is just one straight line. Get gas at Tok just in case.  The roads become terribly bumpy right after crossing the border and little orange flags alert you of very big bumps. It's like that for a while (~2 hours), but the beautiful lakes and mountains in Yukon make up for it.  Chances are you're going to see buffalo on the side of the road, so have your camera ready. I slept at a campground in Whitehorse.   Whitehorse to Fort Nelson. ~12 hours. Nothing special. Lots of forest, some public bathrooms with no running water along the way. Get a buffalo burger and fuel at Toad River. Take a picture of all the hats hanging from the ceiling. Motel in Ft Nelson was not great but it was cheap. There was a Domino's across the street from that motel.  Fort Nelson to Grand Prairie. ~8 hours. (OR Fort Nelson to Edmonton ~12 hours) Nothing special. The towns along the way are bigger, so there are more gas stations and restaurants. Dawson Creek is where you might find more of that stuff.   Also, there is a chain of gas stations that was all green themed, which is confusing because I thought green was the universal symbol for ""yo, this is a diesel pump!"" They do have gas, though.  It's not necessary to stay at Grand Prairie, but I was feeling lazy and a nice hotel had a special ($50 per night when USD and CAD were on par!). Edmonton is ~4 hours from here."
alaska,3bpt80,o_Oscar,2,Wed Jul 1 07:27:42 2015 UTC,"I did awhile ago, I think it took 4 days, it wasn't bad we hit a few cities on the way to Edmonton but alot of forest too. We never had a problem finding or getting gas or rooms. It was a good trip I think we stayed for 4-5 days and stayed in the mall which wasn't too bad. The mall is huge though, we wandered that thing up until the day we left and were still finding new nooks to look at.   I am glad I did it but I would rather fly if I went again."

That said, as beautiful as everything is in between, I'd rather fly next time; it's a damn long road, and there aren't enough Tim Hortons between here and there to make up for it."
alaska,3bpt80,k8faust,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:49:39 2015 UTC,"For me it was always a 3 day, averaging 600 miles a day, between Edmonton and Fairbanks.  From Anchorage you'd need to push that closer to 650 miles a day (if you stay over in Haines Jct. you'd be just slightly below that the first day, if you push through to Whitehorse you'll be ahead and can slack off a bit.  Another way to do it is staying over in Destruction Bay, Muncho Lake and Valley View which keeps the days to a much easier 550-600 mile range and then a 200 mile hop to Edmonton that will only take a few hours off your arrival day.)    The reality, though, is a trip of that magnitude (even more so if one was travelling farther), is that the journey is a destination in itself as the majority of that trip is interesting scenery as opposed to the overload one would get on the marine highway followed by the mind numbing sameness of the second half from Prince Rupert inland).  While it certainly is nice to plan things out and know what your stops are going to be, it's better to build in some flexibility (I've overnighted at good share of the communities along the way other than Grand Prairie and Destruction Bay) so one can stop at interesting things, gauge the stops by how the road is, traffic, construction, how you feel and alertness, weather, and even availability of lodgings (For instance, on the way back if one found the preferred range of lodgings to be booked up in Whitehorse, Haines Junction is just another two hours up the highway.) or stagger your overnights and stops so that you'll have all new things to investigate and explore on the return trip.   And too, you'll find some places really aren't to your liking, maybe a person really doesn't want to stay in Whitehorse because many of the lodgings are right downtown, or Watson Lake is fine if it's just a quick overnight stop, but given more time the biggest attraction is a bunch of stolen signs tacked up on posts, different things appeal to different people.    And once you get there, if you really don't want to stay in the city, consider staying out in Stony Plain or Spruce Grove.    EDIT:  Not sure if anyone mentioned this, but pick up a current copy of the Milepost ahead of time, it will give you a feel for what to expect and will be an asset while on the road.    Second thing is one of the quirks is that a great share of those travelling the highway are older (and/or from more eastern time zones), and they tend to get on the road early and stop for the night early as well, so driving late into the day (or night) can result in limited choices and sometimes even places that are already full.  It's not as bad as it was prior to the economy slacking off and the gas prices rising, but it's still something to consider if you are at a point where deciding to call it a day or to push on to the next settlement is happening."

Guy who runs the joint is a weird one for sure, but he knows some pretty hard to Google obsure info(like how to make savage 30-303 from 308 and 30-30 cartridges). Great Northern guns is decent, but the fat dude behind the counter made me swear off ever shopping there again. They had a browning BDM in stock. I called ahead because its a rare gun. Guy said he had one in the case. Get there and ask for it, the larger guy said no such gun exsists.

If not, stop at Barnes and Noble in Anchorage when you get here, and buy this year's copy.  Search in /r/alaska for The Milepost. We seriously recommend it to every person who says they are driving around Alaska on their own. It's that good.  I think your itinerary is fairly reasonable (it's not unrealistic like some visitors who post in /r/alaska). Just note that for driving around Alaska, almost all of our highways are two-lane. And even the few four-lane highways we have, they are frequently the only road between communities. There aren't ""shortcuts"" or ""another way around,"" so if there's a wildfire or an accident or anything of the like, the highway affected gets shut down. Since it's summer, the only precaution you would have to make is to have some water and some snacks."

alaska,3bifdg,eightinchrectalswab,2,Mon Jun 29 22:22:29 2015 UTC,"Be aware that there are over 300 active wildfires going on right now in the state.  The weather is supposed to get warm and dry again early this week and stay that way for a while, probably leading to more fires.  You may want to check http://afsmaps.blm.gov/imf_fire/imf.jsp?site=fire to see if there are any large wildfires in the areas you want to visit.  The affects of these fires on your trip may be limited to just smoke blocking the views of distant scenery or it could cause the closure of one of the major highways.  Based on the current fire situation, the only thing I see that may be problematic is the Talkeetna portion.  You may also want to consider a flightseeing outfit based at Merrill Field or Lake Hood in Anchorage instead if it is too smokey in the Talkeetna area.  As far as I know, Seward and Homer are OK, but you have to drive past a few fires to get there.  Also, make sure to check out 511.alaska.gov for road closure info when you get here."

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see. Only two states had words larger than their state name/abbreviation as the largest word, Wisconsin with ""Walker"" (our governor) and California with ""Water"".

In Seward, you can be out all day, or just do a half day cruise. What I would recommend personally, is watching the weather and booking a tour if you expect that the weather will be good. Sometimes you can even get onboard if you head over there as soon as they open in the morning. If you book a cruise and the weather turns, and they DON'T leave the marina, you get a full refund. If they go out even just a little bit, you only get a partial refund - and it's lame. I learned the hard way, that I'm not going to pay in advance for something unless I know for sure the weather is going to cooperate.

You will need a car, unless you are cool with riding your bike in the rain and snow mixed with rain, depending on when you will be there. There are many miles of logging roads to explore, so you should bring a mountain bike too. There are also a ton of tiny islands around Ketchikan to explore with your kayak. It might be more kayak friendly than Kodiak, and is definitely easier to get to on the ferry than Kodiak. It rains a lot in all three places, but Ketchikan is the rainiest, you just sort of stop noticing it after a while. No matter where you go, your dog is gonna love it."

alaska,3b5627,jeteaway,5,Fri Jun 26 12:13:49 2015 UTC,Old float planes are the norm in Alaska because there aren't any modern aircraft that can do the same job. But just because they are old doesn't mean they aren't airworthy. Maintenance laws for commercial aircraft are strict. In this case the plane engine had been converted to a turbine so you'd have to go out of your way to find many original parts.

Take the road as if you're heading to Whittier, there will be a sign with the tunnel toll fees displayed, next to that is a parking lot. You may see some cars there, park there (if you habe hit the tunnel you've gone too far!) Somewhere near the railing there is a small trail that leads to the lake (sortof steep but doable)... Launch your kayak from down there, stay close enough to the shore so you aren't a nuissance to the tour boat (there are a few waterfalls that are pretty to paddle by anyway) and watch out for larger icebergs (they can flip without notice)... The glacier itself is around the bend (out of sight from the parking lot, a special sight reserved for paddlers and hikers). There is a beach near the glacier where you can land to rest before your way back. Thats it! Enjoy! Oh, and if you're new to the area, it's about an hour south of Anchorage.

alaska,3b11vq,lobotomygold,3,Thu Jun 25 12:29:33 2015 UTC,"In Southeast Alaska, buildable land on the water tends to be very pricey (at least in my opinion). You can do some searches online to come up with the current numbers. Ten years from now, who knows? If the capital where to move north (not that I think it will anytime soon) I could see that influencing land prices.   As far as building materials in the smaller towns/villages, it depends on where you end up. You won't be able to buy materials in a lot of smaller communities. People tend to load up a truck/trailer and go the ferry route. Again, ten years from now who knows? In Southeast a fair number of the smaller communities are disappearing or turning into retirement towns. The ferries may no longer be active by that time.  I would say as long as you have your land purchased, your home built, and know how to fish/hunt/garden/gather, 30k a year is plenty."

Right now there is a promo running, $100.00 for any speed, new customers only, sign into a 1, 2, or 3 year contract. This can save you anywhere from 10 - 80 (I think?) bucks a month (10M-50M). Minimum 10M speed.  Or you can do the 2 months free of service with 1 year contract. Dedicated line so you'll get the speed you are paying for.

alaska,3az8d3,mostoriginalusername,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:32:11 2015 UTC,ACS if they can get more than 3mpbs at your residence. No overage fees ever that way.   unfortunately since it's aDSL you are at the mercy of location.   GCI is fast but if you netflix or download at all you will hit your cap.
alaska,3az8d3,jadez03,3,Wed Jun 24 18:29:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is all true. You sound like someone that will use your internet connection to it's fullest, so avoid GCI if at all possible."
alaska,3az8d3,ak_doug,2,Wed Jun 24 19:33:43 2015 UTC,ACS will likely be cheaper if you can get it. I would recommend a minimum of 10 Mbps for the usage you propose. GCI has bandwidth caps.

Some outliers at 50GB and 100GB, but very rare. Playing online games does not use a substantial amount of data either, contrary to popular belief.  Only way to know for sure is to try it for a month. 300GB a month was perfectly fine with me and my sister constantly watching Netflix and me downloading games and torrenting. I think we only got the 80% warning once. Mind you, this is all 1080p streaming. Unsure of 4k."

alaska,3az8d3,ChristopherOrChris,0,Wed Jun 24 21:16:26 2015 UTC,"I exaggerated the steam numbers, but it's not hard to hit that when you have to reinstall a library of games.  As for netflix, it's 3gb/hour for HD, all you need to do to hit 600gb is watch 6.45 hours a day. Now this is more than most people, but multiple users or using bandwidth elsewhere decrease how much you need to watch to hit the cap.  I had that cap before I switched to ACS and I found it woefully inadequate even as a single user."
alaska,3az8d3,jadez03,2,Thu Jun 25 10:00:52 2015 UTC,"While I agree that data caps are arbitrary, stupid and shouldn't be in place you're mistaken about how much 600gb is.  You would need to be streaming Ultra HD (and there isn't very much ultra HD to watch on netflix) to touch that kind of cap in a binge watching situation, even so that's over 80 hours of Ultra HD on a 600gb plan.  I throttle my netflix bandwidth at medium quality which is only .7gb an hour.  And when I sit down to watch a nice HD movie on the living room TV I turn on HD streaming.  As for steam out of my 500+ game library only a couple of games are above 30gb installs."

I would estimate around $2,000 to get your vehicle from LA to Anchorage, then sending the car to Juneau is another effort with long drives and ferry rides. Keep in mind that Anchorage to Juneau (via water) is the same distance as Seattle to Juneau. Alaska is a BIG state.. not the little thing you see in the corner of maps.  Another option is Bellingham, WA to Juneau via the Ferry system. Go here: http://dot.alaska.gov/amhs/ and do some research (use ""Quick Schedule Search"").. there is a dozen ways to make it happen but its all what you think will work best for you.   edit Driving from LA to Seattle shouldn't take you more than 2-3 days.. its only 20 hours of driving."

On all seriousness, the drive from anchorage to Seward is my absolute favorite. We've only been here a year, and have a new baby,so we haven't done as much as we would like, but that drive never gets old. Its a 3 hour drive at the most and its beautiful. We always see moose and eagles, and you drive past the mountains and the inlet. And just outside of Seward is the Kenai fjords national park, and you can hike to the exit glacier,  and i think maybe see the harding icefields. Anchorage is just another city, you should plan on visiting to see all there is outside of the city."

alaska,3anqti,TweaktheReaper,5,Mon Jun 22 00:42:20 2015 UTC,"Juneau doesn't really get -20, its coastal climate kinda mellows things out (winters aren't as cold, summers aren't as warm). The winters can be dark, but the overcast/rain of the fall-winter seems to have the biggest psychological impact on people.  It's pretty isolated. A decent sized population, but few know how to properly drive, it seems like Juneau has developed its own driving norms and culture outside of the larger road system. Expect to get cut off, a lot. Usually if people think you have time to break, that means they'll pull out in front of you.  Gas is pretty expensive, but there's only ~40 miles of road so you're not likely to be burning it too much. A lot of heating (in smaller places at least) is electric, and because of our hydro system it isn't too expensive, the mild climate helps with that also. That's not to say the cost of living isn't high though, but it's mostly from the very high housing prices, expensive (and limited) food, and just general markup here for all goods and services.  With the negatives out of the way, it seems like people in healthcare often have good luck at decent high paying jobs. Juneau does have more than its fair share of ritzy, often culture-seeking families so your husband might not be out of luck either. Juneau is incredibly beautiful. If you love to boat, hike, fish, hunt, or watch wildlife, and can put up with long stretches of seemingly endless rain and overcast skies, some days can really make it worth it. If you can afford a boat, or can make friends with someone with a boat, you'll probably have more fun.  Also be sure to hit up /r/Juneau!"

Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend it.  If you somehow manage to get the ultimate luck and find a bluebird day after some days of fresh snowfall, I can almost guarantee it'll be some of the best riding of your life.  We used to just show up, get in line and pay for each ride, individually.  A quick look at a few sites in Valdez show it looks like most of them are pushing for packages (stay and ride, multiple day), but it can't hurt to call.  The snow-cat is another option.  It's cheaper, not as much vertical feet, but still great snow.  An old friend of mine operates 907 Snow Cat Operations (I say ""old friend"", but we don't really keep in touch.  I grew up with him in Valdez, though)."

You really can't go wrong with any of them.
alaska,3aei0n,FrogLevel,3,Fri Jun 19 14:52:26 2015 UTC,How do the helicopter tours compare price-wise to the plane tours? Are you able to see wildlife with the helicopter tours? Thanks for the info!
alaska,3aei0n,FrogLevel,4,Fri Jun 19 15:37:23 2015 UTC,"They are more expensive and are shorter but you do stay lower and see a bit more detail at ground level. Maybe some wildlife sightings but they do not get low enough to really see animals up close. If you want to see the mountain up close go with a plane tour but if you want a bit more detailed view of the ground, have a tendency for airsickness, and a better viewing experience I'd go with the helicopter. They also have tours that land on glaciers or that drop you off to go hiking in remote areas."

If you plan it right, you can do even more by visiting the glacier and whale watching in the same day.  If you get an early start you could summit Jumbo in time to do something in the afternoon as well.  A tour of Tracy arm is pretty sweet.  Helicopter ride to the glacier... lots of stuff."

alaska,3agtqc,SonGopu,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:52:40 2015 UTC,"Depends on weather, but when doing a hike that will last more than 2-3 hours, I usually wear keen hiking boots, jeans and shirt.

alaska,3agtqc,RIP_Frank_Grimes,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:06:07 2015 UTC,"Locals call Mendenhall Glacier ""the glacier.""  You can take a cheap shuttle bus to it.  Herbert Glacier is much further away and you will need to take a taxi then hike or bike 4 or 5 miles on a trail to see it.    Mt. Roberts is downtown and has a gondola like tram that can take you up and down, it costs like $30 or so.  You can continue to the summit from the tram.    Mt. Jumbo is 2 or so miles from downtown on Douglas Island.  I think Jumbo has better views, but you have to hike it.  Another option, Perseverence trail is downtown and is the starting point for many other trails such as Mt. Juneau.    Are you in hiking shape?  If not, I'd just do Mendenhall Glacier Visitors Center, whale watching and take the tram up Mt. Roberts.  Those are two popular tourist attractions.  If you want the best views though, you have to earn it with hiking."

alaska,3aax3i,bamdastard,2,Thu Jun 18 16:53:18 2015 UTC,"pretty awesome.  and sad at the same time.    In fish that large they tend to accumulate lots of toxins, parasites and heavy metals in the meat because they are so old.  So the meat is gross compared to sub 100lb fish.   Also, fish that big are 100% female because all halibut are weird transgender and switch halfway through life.  These giant Female fish lay millions of eggs every year so taking them out of the ocean damages the fishery in the long run.   this is from 2011 btw http://photoblog.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/07/02/7000845-holy-mackerel-kansas-man-catches-466-pound-halibut-in-alaska"

But also, just because they are old their meat will be flaky and kinda gross.    Best halibut eating is around 30lbs.   edit: Proof (30lber from 3 weeks ago)  Take this from a guy who caught about 1500lbs of halibut last year."
alaska,3aax3i,Cdresden,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:33:40 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah, I'm aware they have parasites, but that doesn't bother me.

I've got to say, for all that I've heard people cry about big fish being tough or dry, every pound of that was delicious.  The meat definitely looks different, for sure."
alaska,3aax3i,bamdastard,2,Fri Jun 19 05:53:38 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I mostly don't like keeping the bigger ones just because of how many eggs they lay.  bad karma IMO
alaska,3aax3i,DontRunReds,0,Fri Jun 19 05:57:00 2015 UTC,"Uh, to clear up a misconception  here - halibut are NOT sequential hermaphrodites.  There are male halibut and there are female halibut."
alaska,3aax3i,bamdastard,2,Fri Jun 19 16:25:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm that biologist led me wrong.   I am still right about the big ones almost exclusively being female though. So my reasoning stands.

alaska,3abm6r,CaptAk83,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:10:21 2015 UTC,"Personally I think getting out to wonder lake is the best but I admittedly might be a bit biased. Another commenter said eielson, if you get out that far you can get good views of the mountain, albeit from a slightly different perspective than the straight look at the north side you'll get from wonder lake (the view typically shown in pictures). Also there's great hiking at eielson, doing mt eielson itself probably won't be feasible with your timeframe, but the ridge on the opposite side of the road is totally doable in a couple hours, and these lots of folks around there typically so going off by yourselves shouldn't be an issue, just have some bear spray for peace of mind :). Toklat is pretty too but I'd say at least go the 12ish miles further out to eielson, or go all the way to wonder lake if you can swing it and maybe do a quick hike on your way back east. Have fun!"

alaska,3acg5w,Infamise,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:48:46 2015 UTC,"Definitely bring some crossing shoes, you won't regret it. Something light like tevas is fine. Don't go overboard on clothes, you really don't need a fresh change every day (besides underwear and socks) and being dirty is a small price to pay for hiking with a comfortable pack IMO. Polypropylene is great, a couple of tops and a pair of bottoms, along with shorts, wind pants, windbreaker and a fleece-type jacket should be plenty. Hats are great for the evening and sleeping if it's chilly. Decent footwear that is sufficiently broken in is probably the most important item of gear, so if you're getting new hiking boots for the trip be sure to wear them around a bit before jumping into the hike, and bring some duct tape for possible blisters. Have fun!"

alaska,3a1hg1,HorsesPlease,11,Tue Jun 16 14:20:17 2015 UTC,"I'd note that a lot of the Old Believer villages along the road system, the Kodiak Archipelago, and the Alaska Peninsula are the result of a later migration sometime around 100 years ago, due to persecution.  Soldotna is so named because of the Russian influence in the area. (The Kenai Peninsula was one of the few locations where Russians had forts established.)  Pilot Bread is a Russian-style flatbread cracker that is commercially sold in Alaska.  In Yup'ik, the word for white people is ""gussaq,"" which etymologically comes from the Cossacks, who are native to the steppes of Asia and were frequently indentured to the Russians who were in Alaska.  In the Yukon-Kuskokwim and Bristol Bay regions, Orthodox Christmas (sometimes called Epiphany) is usually called Slaviq, etymologically coming from Slavic.  Many villages in the Y-K and BB regions are located on hills, since that's where Russians emplaced their churches and camps. In Yup'ik culture, hills were a taboo location because the iching'at (i know i spelled that incorrectly but my Yup'ik dictionary is at home) lived in the hills and it was taboo to live near them. Possible translations (but not the right translations) are leprechauns or gremlins or little people. The iching'at were frequently mischevious, but you never knew if they were going to help you, hurt you, kidnap you, or kill you.  More later if it comes to mind."

alaska,39zvhd,blazer243,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:27:49 2015 UTC,"Well, that weekend is Oktoberfest. Alyeska has room/festival deals. The Anchorage German Club has an event as well (2 nights, $15/night). Humpies has drink and menu parings, plus they can get a bit rowdy.  Oct 2 there is a concert by The Well Pennies (folk pop from L.A.) Oct 3 has Scott Bradlee's Postmodern Jukebox. I have no idea what that means. It is a show of some kind. There is a play being put on called Annapurna that week.  It almost never snows that early, but temperatures in the low 40s are normal.  That is definitely outside of the normal tourist season. Things are cheaper but a lot of the tours and what not are done. The museum is worth a look. That Friday is ""First Friday"" with art walks and miscellaneous festivities. I would 100% definitely walk around downtown and find the art shows. You'll see more of the real Alaska art scene and local color there. If you are into beer, visit all of the breweries through out the week.  Since it is only a week, I'd be leery about spreading out too much. That said a drive up to Talkeetna is well worth it. The brewery there is my favorite, the pizza is good (though some say it is hit or miss, I'm probably just lucky) and their museum (only open on Saturdays by then) is super interesting. There is usually a pretty good band playing the Fairview Inn on Friday night, but staying there means no sleep. The Roadhouse is better."

alaska,39x67o,anneless,4,Mon Jun 15 15:05:54 2015 UTC,"Both trips will be a fairly easy drive, the only thing to watch out for is construction. It will take you about 5-7 hours to drive from anchorage to Denali. Make sure to make some stops along the way and enjoy the scenery! It's a beautiful drive.  You won't need to worry about snow. There is none. There maybe some animals that cross your path but you will probably just see them on the side of the road. Just keep your eye out. Make sure to keep some water in your car.   It's going to be an easy drive. Our roads are simple, our signs are simple and there are no huge billboards distracting you from the road."

Mile 145 Parks - on your right, Veterans memorial. Pull off the highway into the driveway for this memorial, and a nice campground at Byers lake State Rec area. Boat rentals available.  Mile 174 Parks, on your left - Hurricane Bridge. Immediately after the bridge there is a small parking lot to your left, with a cool view of this high bridge and the valley the creek feeds into.  Mile 187-ish, on your right - a big abandoned igloo building. Kinda neat, but once you've seen it once, there isn't much else.  Mile 195-208 (After the S-curve with the Railroad Crossing) - Broad Pass. Pretty view of this low open pass, and some opportunities for blueberry picking in early August (wear pants, the bushes will make your legs bleed). After that, you are at Denali.

alaska,39x67o,irish56_ak,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:19:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely invest in the Milepost- it list almost everything worth stopping to see, where to find fuel, food, etc. There are basically only two roads in and out of Anchorage (North and South) and they connect to the other roads in the state. In July traffic may be a problem, especially if you get into construction zones. The road to Seward does wind a lot around Turnagain Arm, but it's relatively flat (it follows the shoreline). Because most of our roads are two lane there are 'Slow vehicle turnouts' - use them if you are slower traffic. You'll run out of energy before you run out of daylight-you'll have at least 17 hours between sunrise/sunset per day. There are 'Safety Zones' where the speed limit will drop to 45/55 MPH in areas where it appears you could easily go faster- they are there because of the high number of accidents that have occurred in those areas and are patrolled regularly. Speed at your own risk (I do)."

alaska,39x67o,orbak,2,Tue Jun 16 00:20:23 2015 UTC,"As several people said, pick up a copy of the Milepost. Can't recommend it enough. If you stop in Talkeetna, come by the airport and take a flightseeing trip and land on Denali! I work at one of the air taxis, but all of the companies here are quite reputable and safe. It seems like the only unanswered question you have is for winding roads. Yes, they do wind a bit, but not bad. If he is especially prone to motion sickness, pick up some dried ginger or ginger gum (or Dramamine, if that's your thing) in Anchorage."
alaska,39x67o,orbak,2,Mon Jun 15 17:57:27 2015 UTC,"Parks Highway is the highway you would drive to Denali, 238 miles from Anchorage. It has actually been repaved along a lot of sections of it recently. That being said, expect road work delays during some parts. It's not very winding, if you obey the speed limit and yellow speed suggestion signs around turns, you will be good, and it should not cause motion sickness.   South of Anchorage on the way to Seward, you will take the Seward highway - the first 40 miles of it out of Anchorage are along a body of water and its a bit more of a winding road, with a 55mph (65 in spots) speed limit. This one may be a bit more prone to cause motion sickiness, but I don't get that issue usually so I can't attest to that.  Don't worry about snow. Keep your eyes on the road - Moose collisions DO happen, but paying attention and staying within speed limits/recommendations will help you out. Seward highway is also paved with some frost heaving between mileposts 45 and 70 (mileposts start at 0 in Seward, continue to about 117 when entering Anchorage). Be patient with others on these highways, only pass when it is safe and legal to do so. They are getting better about putting passing lanes in on the roads, but they are still rather far in between in some spots."

The first time was a big mix up and Rocky gave me the wrong order which turned out to be much more product that what I paid for though I only received an email stating that they were apologetic for not being able to deliver my order.   The second time I used them was a couple weeks ago and again I noticed that they still do not have their shit together.   This time when I used the online order form I saw that they had grams for $0 so I added one.  They later tried to charge me $20 for it which I declined.  Also, they are now charging a delivery fee of either $25 or $10 depending on timing of the order.  This alone has me searching high and low for a reliable alternative source. They also ask for entirely too much info on the order form.  The green is good and they have a few options and they are willing to bring it to your home or meet somewhere so as far as getting bud easy this is a great way to satisfy your need.  Also, the bags they seal the product in are not the best since you have to rip the bottom apart to get to the shake that gets lodged in the corners  Btw, why are you asking for pm on the topic?  I think everyone around is wondering how they are still operating.   Check out the Alaska Dispatch article concerning the arrest of one of their delivery people in January.   http://www.adn.com/article/20150131/anchorage-police-arrest-marijuana-delivery-driver-sting-operation  The impression that I get is that they are poorly organized but making a great deal of money despite that fact and since there seems to be little competition combined with the relative lack of enforcement they are going to be around for a while as they have established themselves early."

alaska,39xsyb,tawndy,5,Mon Jun 15 23:39:57 2015 UTC,"When you get far enough north, consider buying dedicated winter tires; studded would be better. All weather tires are dangerous in the winter. We call them summer tires up here. :)"
alaska,39xsyb,_LVP_Mike,0,Mon Jun 15 18:00:26 2015 UTC,"Mmmm... Untrue, i use all weather tires and they work fine.  Just need to be an alert defensive driver."
alaska,39xsyb,Jamminjordon,5,Mon Jun 15 20:18:32 2015 UTC,"Perhaps around town where roads are regularly plowed and sanded, all-seasons would work if you don't live on too steep of a hill. For driving something as remote as the Alcan, all-seasons would be an awful decision. Defensive driving isn't a thing out there either; there is barely anyone on the road. Driving the Alcan in the winter means dealing with the elements, not other drivers.  Also, OP, buy a tow strap."
alaska,39xsyb,_LVP_Mike,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:48:31 2015 UTC,"Seriously, I dunno, it seems like a point of pride for a lot of Anchoragites to say they use all-season tires (I'm only calling them out because I've heard it the most from them).  Rubber behaves differently at different temperatures, if you're gonna drive out of town, do everyone a favor and get some winter tires, they don't need to be studs, but they'll stick a lot better when it's cold."
alaska,39xsyb,akblah,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:12:35 2015 UTC,"Yep, most of Anchorage rarely drives outside of the Municipality and the Valley during the winter, so I can see why they would think all-seasons are fine. I admit, it was my first thought too."
alaska,39xsyb,_LVP_Mike,2,Tue Jun 16 20:30:00 2015 UTC,"The snow and weather isn't too different from Indiana. We get colder, but your storms are wetter and more intense. The biggest difference is you'll need a block heater and good antifreeze. All mechanic shops do winterization up here, and are pretty good at it.  Happy cake day."
alaska,39xsyb,ak_doug,0,Mon Jun 15 20:35:44 2015 UTC,We don't drive cars up here.   Just learn to saddle a moose like every other Alaskan and you will never need to drive again.
alaska,39xsyb,RIP_Frank_Grimes,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:23:08 2015 UTC,Drive the Jeep to Seattle in January and have it shipped up with Totem Ocean. Easier than driving it all the way up and you won't have to deal with finding a place to store it.

alaska,39xsyb,Iceonthewater,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:42:06 2015 UTC,"You should be ok with all weather tires during that time as the snow hasnt really hit hard by then, not sure what kind of conditions you'll face up through the AlCan highway so you may want to check on those road conditions as you get closer. Mainly just make sure you also have an extra gas can in your car sometimes the stops for gas are few and far between. Make sure you have the right kind of wiper fluid and wiper blades for when you have to drive through snow so it doesnt build up on your blades and freeze over. As far as a place to keep it I would make sure its someplace where they can start it up every once in a while so you dont end up with a dead battery form it sitting in the cold, and like others suggested a block heater so you can keep it plugged in will save your engine in the long run. You can PM me once you know if she got the job, I might know someone willing to let you park the car in their driveway where it can be safe and kept plugged in."

Alaska Raft and Kayak purports to have canoes for rent (and I know they are still in business)."
alaska,39rnmm,akblah,10,Sun Jun 14 02:20:54 2015 UTC,"There's a saying that in Juneau you can't steal a car, just borrow it.    Even if the dude has evaded the law for now, Juneau is a pretty tough starting location for being on the lam.  Years ago in Juneau, some fellows robbed a liquor store, and on the way out, they grabbed a cardboard Frito-Lay's display rack with dozens of little chip packages.  The Frito Bandito caper.  Stupid guys weren't going anywhere; they just hit a liquor store in Juneau.  A couple days later, the cops went around to hotels and checked the dumpsters, and in one they found some empty chip packages.  Then they found the room and arrested the guys."
alaska,39rnmm,Cdresden,9,Sun Jun 14 12:22:41 2015 UTC,We're American's right? We want freedom right? That's what we tell ourselves.   Then why the fuck are lives ruined over what we do with our own body? That's not freedom.
alaska,39rnmm,thulfs,16,Sun Jun 14 05:45:43 2015 UTC,"Oh for Pete's sake.  You can grow plants for yourself legally here now.  That's a fuck of a lot of freedom.  It's like Christmas & the 4th of July all wrapped up together.  But you don't get to grow 140 plants, not without a license, and not yet.  This guy fucked up."

alaska,39rx0l,ak_doug,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:50:15 2015 UTC,"Lazy Mountain is still pretty intense. It might be one of the easier hikes in the area, but it is by no means easy.  It's just not Government Peak or shudder Pioneer Peak."
alaska,39rx0l,ak_doug,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:04:15 2015 UTC,"ok thanks, yeah I mean we want a good hike, but I read about Pioneer Peak, and I think we'll pass on that one.  It sounds like we'll probably start with the Lazy mountain trail and then maybe continue on if we feel like it.  Thanks so much for the help.  Do you know if the willow creek area is ok for fishing and camping after the fire?"
alaska,39rx0l,spanner79,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:20:49 2015 UTC,"If you mean this week, or at any point while the fire is burning, no. Do not go to the Willow area for any reason. (Honestly hiking in the valley can get spotty if the wind picks up)  After that, I have no idea. I do not know how a fire in the area affects fish. I am very curious now though..."
alaska,39rx0l,bamdastard,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:28:11 2015 UTC,Were going in 2 weeks so i was mostly worried about camp sites being destroyed in the fire. I guess well need to look into and maybe find somewhere else to camp

It is 14 hours long but we went all the way through Denali, farther than any other of the tours even. We got an awesome view of Mt McKinley and saw three bears and a ton of other animals. Also, I would spend the last few days down in Kenzie fishing or doing a boat tour."

alaska,39qeng,pat_man,2,Sat Jun 13 19:11:03 2015 UTC,I haven't lived in Dillingham( just visited in winter) but if its anything like King Salmon it wouldn't be a bad idea to pick up a bug shirt or head net if you want to explore a little bit out of town.  Hopefully the fish will come in strong and you'll get tons of overtime because if you don't have a car or boat you might find town and little boring after a week or two.

A local 4x4 club also put up a plaque. Since then the trail has gotten worse (people can't walk any more?), parts of the plane have gone missing and someone stole the plaque.

Lots of steep places and the mud bog is pretty challenging so make sure if you go out there you have some winches. Do not go alone.  To get to the bomber there is a turn off across the river where you can go right or left take the left and cross the river and continue on the trail.   After you cross the mud bog.... Trust me you will know it when you have, just continue on the trail over the top of the mountain and you will see the plane wreckage scattered over the backside.  I have a bad back and I found it pretty challenging, especially having tweaked my back at the very last hill and having the whole trip back to look forward to. I clocked it as 10.1 miles to get to the plane. Message me your # and I will text you some pictures."

I never go alone when I'm riding new trails and everyone I know has winches so hopefully that mud bog won't be too much of a problem. How was the trail? Was it overall swamped or was that more isolated to the river and bog areas?   Is there an obvious staging area for parking my truck or anything like that?

alaska,39iov6,TheGoodTheBadTheRekt,-11,Sun Jun 14 23:12:55 2015 UTC,"Breathtaking scenery, gleaming glaciers, abundant wildlife, and Native American culture are only a few of the spectacular attractions that draw cruise vacationers to Alaska. With so much to see and do in Alaska, it's no wonder the state's official flower is the alpine forget-me-not!  Ships that visit Alaska on a seven-day itinerary typically sail along the Inside Passage and visit Glacier Bay National Park or Hubbard Glacier, stopping at four ports along the way. Most cruise lines also offer a variety of extended cruise-tour package options which take passengers deeper into Alaska via train and include land stays at lodges and sightseeing in Denali National Park - making their trip to Alaska even more comprehensive.  For climate and sunlight purposes, cruises to Alaska sail strictly during the summer months, from early May to mid-September. June, July and August can be classified as peak season when average daily high temperatures can reach 75 degrees Fahrenheit, so those looking for the best value should check sailing dates in May and September when temperatures hover around 50 degrees.  A variety of cruise ships sail to Alaska, including luxury vessels and midsize ships - most of which offer expanded kids programs for family vacationers. While the majority of ships sail from Vancouver, BC, Seattle is increasingly becoming a popular summer homeport for many lines. Both embarkation/disembarkation points allow ships to visit the most popular ports on an Alaska cruise, including Juneau, Ketchikan and Skagway.  Ports of Call Juneau Alaska's capital city, Juneau, has a population of about 30,000 and one of the country's highest costs of living. It also houses many attractions, including the famed Mendenhall Glacier, Alaska State Museum, the Alaska Brewing and Bottling Co., St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church and the Red Dog Saloon, a famed Juneau bar/restaurant with swinging doors, sawdust floors and a display of Alaskan history.  Mendenhall Glacier Described by John Muir as ""one of the most beautiful coastal glaciers,"" the world-famous Mendenhall Glacier attracts curious vacationers who want to enjoy the rush of a helicopter ride and set foot on the surface of this massive piece of ice. Others can see the glacier from afar during a tour of Juneau or come face to face with it by during a kayaking or rafting adventure.  Fishing Sportfishing and fly-fishing are two popular fishing options offered by cruise lines. Vacationers can choose to head out to troll for salmon on a private sportfishing boat fully equipped with all the necessary fishing gear and a licensed U.S. Coast Guard approved captain in one of the best fishing grounds in Southeast Alaska, or opt to take a short plane ride to a fly fishing hot spot to search out salmon and trout.  Low-key Options Those who prefer not to be too active in Juneau can attend an authentic Alaskan salmon bake complete with a hefty barbeque meal of salmon (of course), chicken, baked beans, salads, cornbread and roasted marshmallows; explore historic Juneau by land and visit the Macauley Salmon Hatchery and witness spawning salmon; or tour Juneau's award-winning brewery.  Ketchikan This ""salmon capital of the world,"" is a quaint Alaskan town with a population of 7,922. The largest collection of totem poles in the world resides in Ketchikan at Totem Bight State Historical Park, Saxman Native Village and the Totem Heritage Center Museum.

alaska,39c8nx,badmash108,3,Wed Jun 10 20:04:52 2015 UTC,"If it's not to big a strain on your budget, I'd recommend taking both.  They're similar, but still offer very different viewing experiences.  The 26 Glacier tour takes you up into some narrow waterways and great glacier viewing, while the Kenai Fjords tour, (depending on which one you take, of course), offers a better viewing chance for sea birds, marine mammals, plus you get a nice look into the open waters of the Gulf of Alaska. I've done both, and would do both again.  The other thing you could do would be to book a halibut fishing trip out of Seward instead of the Kenai Fjords trip- you'd see the same areas, although without the stopping and looking at birds and marine mammals, and you could bring home a bunch of tasty fish."

alaska,39c8nx,Mr_Iron_Oxide,2,Wed Jun 10 20:58:05 2015 UTC,"There will be similar scenery. Mountain goats, seals, otters, whales, water, mountains, glaciers, among other stuff.   Since moving up here, I've done 4 trips. I enjoyed all of them. In fact my mother and nephew are visiting in July and I have us booked for another one.  I would recommend the sea life center while in seward, it is totally worth it and the behind the scenes tour is super cool.  I'm not sure how much I helped you, but you definitely want to go on at least 1 of them, but you'll still enjoy it if you go on 2. Make room/time for Sea life Center, for sure.  Have fun in Alaska!!"

alaska,39c8nx,fajord,2,Wed Jun 10 22:24:42 2015 UTC,"Seward will be jammed with people during the 4th of July. You most likely won't even be able to find a campsite. That being said, the KFNP trip is much better. You'll see a half dozen glaciers, plus far more wildlife. Seward is also a much more fun place than Whittier."

I like that it has the glaciers, but also all of the wild life and if you are a WWII buff, it is really cool to see all of the old abandoned military stuff throughout the bay. Plus they feed you a decent meal. If you are intending on being in Seward for the 4th though, be prepared for the Mt. Marathon Festivities. Seward is not the same small town that weekend!"

alaska,398yj6,hitbere,6,Wed Jun 10 02:54:09 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of cabins up there at Hatcher pass that may still be public use. The one down near the end of Archangel Valley used to have a wood burning stove and people would bring wood and dry food like soups, some canned goods, and there were notebooks that people would sign, leave a note, maybe even journal a page. Was pretty awesome until some dumb shots ruined it for everyone and started pulling wood off a nearby cabin to burn, and started using journal pages as fire starter. It's called Slewfoot cabin, and the stove was removed to prevent further vandalism. I'll remember it fondly, though. I was there with my three kids, my mother, my sister and her three kids, my brother, his wife, and their three kids, all picking berries, and it rained. The kids would go into the cabin where my mother and other sister were manning the stove and the kids would take off their wet things and dry them over the barrel stove. It was wonderful.   Gold Cord Lake is one of my favorite places up there. Truly another world up there when it's misty."

AT&T doesn't like owning towers because it's a liability.  They contract out their tower climbers and tower work.  GCI has almost as good coverage but they are in the process of a LOT of buildout after getting ACS's infrastructure.  Honestly, in a couple year I bet they'll have all the highways covered with LTE.  They're deploying fiber like crazy.   They like owning towers, and have their own tower crews that are part of the company.  Verizon has a few towers in alaska, and you can tell they are verizon because while they have little spectrum and few towers, they have the best looking sites (typically concrete, with a generator, and redundant wall mount air conditioners).  Verizon likes owning towers.  I think GCI has the most spectrum, but it's real close with AT&T.  Verizon only has a single small allocation of spectrum."

Source: my mom sued my gramma because my gramma ran her over while they were out berry picking.  I promise my mom didn't want to sue her, her health insurance company wouldn't cover her bills because it was a car accident and grammas car insurance wouldn't cover them unless there was a suit filed.

alaska,39447u,Manfred1816,4,Tue Jun 9 03:03:31 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you're tying up your food to keep the critters out.  If that's the case I recommend a bear canister.  The south 1/3 of the trail is alpine and treeless.  The river is an easy cross unless it's been a rainy time.  I've never crossed in higher than my mid thigh but I've heard of smaller folk (5'2"") getting in up to their nipples but they could have also crossed at a bad location.  The trail forking is a non issue in my times.  The paths that are closer to the river are more likely to be washed/eroded out so there is a small chance you will have to backtrack if that happens.  Just an inconvenience really. I haven't found a path that is bad enough to mention.  It's a great trip I have plans to do it at least once (if not twice) this summer.  Take your time and bang some peaks along the way.  I don't know anything about fishing conditions along the route.  Good idea though."

Eh, I'll bring a pole just in case we come across a spot that seems worth it to drop a line, but we certainly won't rely on catching anything."
alaska,39447u,ak501,3,Tue Jun 9 04:09:17 2015 UTC,"I've been doing that trip at least once a summer. By July the trail should be pretty well traveled and easy to find.   I'm not sure about this but I don't really think there is much fishing on eagle river, so I wouldn't bother with the fishing pole. We have encountered snow late in the year there so be ready to hike down a snow pac or two. If you are doing it in one night, try to camp near the river and cross in the morning. If you are doing it in 2 nights there's is a spot where there's a bridge over a ravine, I think its called raven gorge or something like that.  The best camping sites for night 2 are along the river at the few tributary streams. Bring tevas or water shoes for the crossing, it is well worth the weight to put on dry boots afterward. The trail feels like its done towards the end, even though you are really like 6 miles from the nature center. There aren't any mile markers so just keep trucking. We see a black bear almost every year."

One guy reported seeing 11 in one day.  In my experience, hanging food is problematic. The large trees that are necessary are almost non-existent at this latitude. Black bears will have no problem getting your food out of a tree, and I have heard of people losing their food this way.  A bear canister is much easier, although they are big and heavy. I think you can rent them from REI."

alaska,39447u,CosmosFood,3,Tue Jun 9 05:30:19 2015 UTC,"If you camp by raven gorge the first night you can hang stuff from the bridge if nothing else, and there's trees once you get down to the river.

alaska,39447u,Alaskanzen,3,Tue Jun 9 06:29:49 2015 UTC,"I hiked it years ago. We saw 5 black bears and there was fish in some creeks past the river crossing. Honestly, it's pretty easy after the first 4 miles. After that, it's almost all a gentle down hill hike. Check with the eagle river nature center if fish are running a week before you go. If you need campsites, there are plenty. Have fun!"
alaska,39447u,907choss,2,Tue Jun 9 05:23:19 2015 UTC,"I just hiked it last year, same direction. We camped the first night by the river and crossed it first thing. What I noticed people didn't mention are the other river crossings. Those consist of a log or two placed across a wide, quick moving stream with a rope to help for balance. They're very doable, but can be daunting if you're not prepared. The other big issue my group had was the 'rock scaling' portion. Again, it's not a huge deal, but there's a semi tricky portion where you'll be topping a ladder onto a boulder to grab onto a rope to shimmy across the face. Unencumbered, it's not a real issue, but with a pack it can be difficult. Especially if you're not the most confident or are afraid of heights as it backs a steep fall to the river.  As others have said, the trail will likely have washed out at places, but it's easy to see where it continues. Overall, it's a great hike. I actually plan on doing it again this year."

alaska,394gxc,PMmeyourtaint,3,Tue Jun 9 07:46:15 2015 UTC,"Kincaid is great, both singletracks and ski trails. Hillside also has a smaller singletrack system, right above hilltop ski area. It's less flowy and most of the curves aren't banked, but you can still have fun. Powerline trail is great, but chugach electric (local electric utility) will be doing line upgrades July-October, and the trail area closer to the pass will be closed. So if you want to do that, get to it this month- later the better for less snow pack crossings. Out of town, Mat-Su valley has the Keppler-Bradley trail system by Matanuska Lake, also nice trails."

Depending on your skill level you could go back to the glacier behind that.   If you are in good shape but inexperienced that hike has a nice trail to the lakes, but after that it is a back country route. Don't get over your head ever.   Ptarmigan Valley is nice from what I hear. I haven't tried it yet though.   My roommates and I really like to go up flattop(most hiked trail in the state) and then go behind flat top and go to peak 2 and 3. Peak 3 has some snow fields on it I don't feel comfortable trying this time of the year though. Once you go over flattop mountain there's like no one.   Next weekend were going back to Ptarmigan pass that is in that same area to check out a tarn and Ptarmigan peak. I can report back on that if you remind me."

Another place would be flatop mountain, it's pretty close and if your aim is to have a cheap but good experience,  well there you go! Check out crow's pass and Girdwood too.

alaska,391mov,Angry__Jellyfish,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:35:18 2015 UTC,"You should check out Chenah hot springs in Fairbanks, then hit up Denali and Talkeetna either on the way up or coming down. Denali is cool but its loaded with tourists and you'll have to take a bus to actually get in the real Denali not just the Disneyland outskirts of it. After Denali start heading south, check out Girdwood. If you're feeling fancy you can take the tram to the top of the mountain and eat at 7 Glaciers. Winner's Creek Trail is a good hike with a cool hand tram at the end. Then there's Byron Glacier which is south of Girdwood. It is SO COOL. You can walk into a glacier cave, just be careful! OH! And there's the Matanuska Glacier. You pay 20$ per person to get to the glacier but you can literally walk up to it or on it. Anyway after all that head to Seward and check out Exit Glacier, theres also a sea-aquarium thing over there. And then you should definitely check out Homer, maybe do some fishing if you can. Have a great time, feel free to hit me up with any questions!"

Not sure what else yet though."
alaska,38xcpi,badmash108,6,Sun Jun 7 17:23:43 2015 UTC,"You only have 4 days, don't waste so much time driving. I would skip Fairbanks altogether and spend as little time in Anchorage as possible because Anchorage is just a big urban sprawl and doesn't really represent anything Alaskan.  I would try to spend 2 days on the Kenai peninsula instead. Maybe explore Homer. The other option is to drive to Valdez after Denali. It would be a long drive, but beautiful. In my (maybe controversial) opinion Valdez has more to offer than Seward because the glacier cruises to the massive Columbia Glacier are amazing."
alaska,38xcpi,nordak,2,Sun Jun 7 18:12:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of this. I live in Fairbanks, and would never recommend visiting here if you have that little time. This state is biiiig, and roads are generally not fast, because of construction and damage in the parts that aren't under construction. Making the trip over to Valdez is a great idea. The drive across on the Glenn highway is absolutely gorgeous, and Valdez and the Prince William Sound are, in my opinion, some of the most beautiful places on the planet."

So, expect more traffic that way, and lots of crowds and no where to park. Mt. Marathon is very neat though, and is worth seeing since you'll be there already.  Also, I totally agree with people about how much driving you'll be doing. Have you considered gas prices? In AK they are higher and may affect your budget more than you think. If budget isn't an issue, look into flights from Anchorage to Fairbanks, they may be worth saving yourself 12 hours of being stuck behind RVs on a one lane road."

I actually want to see a different scenery and wanted to know any alternative routes from Fairbanks to Moose Pass. I was thinking about from Fairbanks -> Paxson -> Nelchina -> Anchorage -> Moose Pass; but that will be a very long drive I guess. Any suggestions?
alaska,38xcpi,weeder57,0,Sun Jun 7 17:30:48 2015 UTC,"I would stick to the parks highway, going the richardson route will add 5 to 6 hours at least of driving. Your going to be doing lots of driving. Fairbanks to moose pass will take the majority of your day, And whatever you do, do not drive north the few days before the 4th if its sunny out. It is bumper to bumper and it will ruin your plans. Also expect to have to wait for a few hours due to rorad closures due to accidents. Especially on the seward highway."

Go explore and see some wildlife in Hatcher pass or head down to Homer as opposed to Seward on July 4th.   If you want to see Denali and have more time to yourselves to explore use a day to see Hacther pass then head to Talkeetna for dinner. You get views of the mountain and its an adorable little town with a great brewery.
