Mobile artillery vehicles are designed to shoot at targets at distances extreme enough to where there might not be any direct line of sight between the tank and the target, at which point the silencer doesn't need to make the tank too quiet to hear, it just needs to make it quiet enough to make it hard to figure out exactly where it is.

mildlypenis,33fz03,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Apr 22 05:14:09 2015 UTC,"Fasciation:       Fasciation (or cresting) is a relatively rare condition of abnormal growth in vascular plants in which the apical meristem (growing tip), which normally is concentrated around a single point and produces approximately cylindrical tissue, instead becomes elongated perpendicularly to the direction of growth, thus, producing flattened, ribbon-like, crested, or elaborately contorted tissue.  Fasciation may also cause plant parts to increase in weight and volume in some instances.  The phenomenon may occur in the stem, root, fruit, or flower head. Some plants are grown and prized aesthetically for their development of fasciation.  Any occurrence of fasciation has several possible causes, including hormonal, genetic, bacterial, fungal, viral and environmental causes.

It is a common mushroom in Europe and western North America, where it occurs in habitats rich in wood debris such as forests and mulched gardens. It appears from summer to late autumn. The fruiting structure is tall and white with a slimy, dark olive colored conical head. Known as the gleba, this material contains the spores, and is transported by insects which are attracted by the odor닧escribed as resembling carrion. Despite its foul smell, it is not poisonous and immature mushrooms are consumed in parts of France and Germany.
