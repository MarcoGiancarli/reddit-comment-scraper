Those old Range Rovers have soft suspension (today they have anti-roll bars that disconnect for off-roading) and she was practically rubbing the door handles on the road in the bends. She was flying, with police protection officers following in a Rover. She's getting on a bit now though, I'm surprised she still drives herself at all."

photoshopbattles,3do1r4,eleventhroughtwelve,376,Sat Jul 18 04:24:26 2015 UTC,"Thats called global illumination (in cg), and its part of why accurate lighting in video games is so difficult to pull off."

photoshopbattles,3do1r4,Pain3128,2,Fri Jul 17 23:52:42 2015 UTC,"Same, the first thing people always seem to ask is how it looks different to me ....... how the hell do i describe that, i cant see it like you can, honestly the only differences it makes to me is that i cant figure out the dam numbers on those color tests.... sucked being the only one getting it wrong in school =(... mainly because that's how the questions start."

They look very similar to you but look very different to us. I would describe what you see as dirty slightly greenish yellow. You can't describe it because that's the only green/red you have even seen in your life just like how people with normal color vision cannot describe what red or green looks like to them.  please tell me if I missed your  point"

photoshopbattles,3do1r4,stunt_penguin,10,Sat Jul 18 15:38:26 2015 UTC,"Another big factor in rendering people is sub surface scattering ... skin allows a tiny bit of light to scatter below the surface to illuminate otherwise shaded areas, so hard shadows should be a tiny bit softer in a way that makes sense to our eyes"
photoshopbattles,3do1r4,deepthink42,12,Sat Jul 18 15:44:34 2015 UTC,"actually it's called bounce light.  Global illumination is a technique used to artificially create ""fake"" bounce light though."
photoshopbattles,3do1r4,eleventhroughtwelve,16,Sat Jul 18 03:25:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats why I said ""in cg""."
photoshopbattles,3do1r4,deepthink42,3,Sat Jul 18 05:00:15 2015 UTC,their are many ways to replicate bounce light in cg.
photoshopbattles,3do1r4,eleventhroughtwelve,7,Sat Jul 18 08:00:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not really going to argue with you about it. If you refer to this as GI in CG circles, everyone knows what you mean and what effect you're going for, which is why I specified ""CG"". I work in CG, and nobody calls this 'bounce light' at the level of light hitting a jersey - everyone calls it GI. Bounce light is typically reserved for when you're talking about specific lighting setups and want to mention a lights specific purpose of being used as indirect illumination.  You can be pedantic about it all day if you want, I was just relaying an interesting fact about the general sense and use of the term in cg."
photoshopbattles,3do1r4,deepthink42,10,Sat Jul 18 01:05:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah not to get in a pissing contest. . .I also work in vfx/cg.  We call it bounce light all the time.  for example. ""You need more bounce on that arm from the jersey"""
photoshopbattles,3do1r4,koesher,4,Sat Jul 18 01:15:23 2015 UTC,"Also not in a pissing contest but here are some more facts. The effect is called color bleeding, The algorithm within the global illumination model is called indirect diffuse reflection or diffuse interreflections, and bounce is a parameter. Artist manipulate the parameters to change effects like color bleeding but not to create them. So for the scenario you mentioned you are correct in increasing the bounce since your changing the effect. But the effect in itself is not bounce."

Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.” -Douglas Adams, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"

So the pope takes the driver seat and the driver sits in the back and it does not take long for the limo to be breaking the speed limit with the pope laughing all the way from enjoyment.  BUT all fun things must come to an end and soon enough the lights from a police motorcycle appeared in the rear mirror and pulled over the limo.  The bike cop gets off his bike, takes out his ticket book and goes to knock on the driver window just to see the pope smiling back at him.  Without another word the cop goes back to the bike and radio's head office and asks to be put through to the chief.  ""Chief, this if officer Bob. I've just pulled over a speeding limousine and have encountered a bit of a problem, this is a celebrity vehicle and I dont know whether to skip the ticket""  ""Well officer Bob, who in tarnations is in the back of the limo"" ""I cant say sir, but He has the Pope as his personal chauffeur!!!"""

I would make Ernie a bit smaller.  Make the shadow sharper (the closer the shadow to the object, generally the sharper.     Since there are two light sources close by, I doubled the shadow and overlapped them, then blurred them both a bit.  Multiplied and lowered opacity till good.  Also make the amount of shadow exposed less to appear closer to the object it's cast on (ie wall).  Hope that is useful to you.  here is what it looked like  NSFW gruesome version of Ernie"

If a dropbox link gets even slight regular usage, it doesn't work as well. When dropbox links generate a lot of traffic in a short period of time, everyone gets locked out of them. That's why you never see front page images on dropbox. Dropbox will temporarily disable popular links because their servers can't handle a lot of traffic at once. Imgur doesn't do this unless their entire site is under heavy load, which doesn't happen nearly as often. Imgur has better UI. Dropbox is used for general downloading and hosting, and isn't optimized for image viewing. Imgur is optimized for images. Dropbox isn't RES compatible. Dropbox doesn't work on mobile."
photoshopbattles,3cx4aa,BSledge,17,Sat Jul 11 19:01:19 2015 UTC,7 Dropbox doesn't work on mobile.
photoshopbattles,3cx4aa,Hellregal,5,Sat Jul 11 19:21:48 2015 UTC,Don't have mobile so I missed that. Thanks for letting me know!

photoshopbattles,3cz286,Riker_is_number_1,2,Sun Jul 12 13:22:11 2015 UTC,Do dwarves have dwarf children? Or is it like a 50/50 thing?
photoshopbattles,3cz286,ConstanceFry,3,Sun Jul 12 13:53:12 2015 UTC,"It depends on the specific condition. He has achondroplasia, which is a dominant genetic condition. He has a 50% chance of passing it on to his children."
photoshopbattles,3cz286,Riker_is_number_1,-3,Sun Jul 12 14:56:19 2015 UTC,"Question is, is it ethical for him to have children then? Knowingly bringing a child that will have a big physical disability, something to think long about. If he has a child with a woman with the same dominant gene as him, is the risk of the child being born a dwarf bigger or the same size?"
photoshopbattles,3cz286,mrcoolbp,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:35:37 2015 UTC,"Is it really our place to question whether or not he should have children? I mean he's a little person, look at how fucking awesome he is."
photoshopbattles,3cz286,Riker_is_number_1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:33:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah he's cool, and I like how after GoT, his name got so big in such a short period of time. But questioning how ethical it is for him to have children isn't a tall order, it's a normal question of normal proportions."
photoshopbattles,3cz286,mrcoolbp,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:54:56 2015 UTC,"My point is I don't think that consideration should lie in our hands, it should lie with him.  edit seriously downvotes for saying I think it should be his decision whether he can have kids or not? Excuse my french but you guys are fucked up. I don't mind the down-votes but who are we to decide this??"
photoshopbattles,3cz286,boofire,0,Sun Jul 12 14:54:52 2015 UTC,"Well seeing how our SCOTUS have seen that there is a fundamental  right to have a family (Meyer v Nebraska and Skinner v Oklahoma), I think its none of our goddamn business to determine if its ethical for a man to reproduce. Additionally you are a monster if you think you, I, or any one individual has the right to decide who can reproduce and who cannot."

photoshopbattles,3cz286,masterhumus,2,Sun Jul 12 17:18:21 2015 UTC,"As far as I know the possibility of a dwarf having a dwarf child is the same as a ""normal"" person having a dwarf child."
