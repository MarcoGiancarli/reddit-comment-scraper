Screenwriting,3e381t,redwardo,27,Tue Jul 21 16:47:02 2015 UTC,"Since hosting unlimited PDFs is virtually free now, a new competitor to the Black List could offer to host scripts forever at no cost, making them sharable by choice - to selected individuals, groups, or the full public depending on an author's preferences - then instead of charging $25 or whatever per month (ridiculous), charge slightly more than the Black List and similar services for higher quality in-depth reads and coaching services. Be known for the quality of your notes. -In addition to ""development professionals"". Charging $25 per month to host a PDF is the catastrophic glaring weakness of similar services. That $25 should be spent on higher quality notes, coaching, and an author's Life.  You may quickly collect a massive number of writers initially interested in just sharing their scripts from your ""hosting"" site for free. Encourage them to keep the default share setting to ""public"" or ""all members"" like Amazon Studios, so, authors can read and comment on each other's scripts (for free). Maybe even host scripts and show bibles in .mobi format for sale to persons who would like to earn or pay a few dollars to sell or read eScripts, like Amazon.com?  Most importantly, allow authors to ask other authors on the site (who have a reputation for providing quality notes) to read scripts for negotiated prices. Laypersons - who may not be ""development professionals"" but can still write exceptional notes - would promote your site themselves if they were paid by other authors to read scripts for anywhere from $5-500. Anything to raise the quality of notes. There is a vast army of super-literate writers interested in reading their peers' scripts...they do this now for free, they do not put quite as much into their notes as they would if they were paid, and they might not meet all the demand for their note-giving ability. Writemash could create a market between authors themselves. Incentivize quality notes, generate more notes, facilitate script sharing, and you will start a virtuous spiral leading to higher quality scripts, cutting edge reputation, and profit. This can work in conjunction with your ""development professionals"" angle...good note-providers would also like to be recognized by industry professionals as potential readers for hire, too. Everyone in this forum reads other amateurs' scripts...they currently aren't being paid for it, even though they might be the source of the highest quality notes.   The more competition the better....if Writemash, The Black List, and Amazon don't evolve to take advantage of a new market generated by free hosting and worldwide readers I hope someone does.   good luck"

Screenwriting,3e381t,truth__bomb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks SmartAlice - and I agree, a focused rewrite can do wonders! I found that the best writers would really focus on a rewrite from a whole new angle, or just focus on overhauling one particular aspect of the piece (structure, tone, use of the medium) and uncover so much in the process. It takes a certain amount of discipline but doing it can do great things for the piece and for the skills (and confidence) of the writer too.  Interesting too to hear that you're a former script reader yourself. Maybe you'd be interested in signing up as a development professional?"

I sent a PDF of a reality TV dating show I created from scratch in Nov 2014 and that's the reason they want to work with me.  It really does take a lot of discipline to produce good work and I used meditation, yoga, deep breathing ect.. whatever I have to do to get my brain to calm down, focus and work.

If it's what's called a board-driven show that means the storyboard artists get an outline with the story fleshed out and come up with the rest on their own.  So I think they just want a little taste of you showing that you can draw, be visually funny, and tell a complete story.    If it's not board-driven, that means you'd work from scripts and in that case, each show usually will have a test they send you to make sure you're on model and can be a sort of ""cinematographer.""  It seems to me if you're working off a script, they would want you to also include that script to see how you adapted it - otherwise what is the point?  If I were you, I would come up with your own little thing and draw it out."

Screenwriting,3e31xk,cynicallad,9,Tue Jul 21 16:03:47 2015 UTC,"I read 10 pages.  I won't comment on the writing itself. You can obviously write effectively.  I don't really know what this world is supposed to be. World building is tough. And I think you're going for some kind of steampukish alternate universe. But it's hard to say because you're not showing me much. I think you can afford to have some bigger description blocks to describe the world better. Right now, I'm filling in the blanks myself and that's not really a great thing.  A bigger problem is the dialogue. It's expositional. The guards talk's only purpose seems to be to clue us in to the fact that Silas is in and out of the city all the time.  The father saying ""Did I tell you to go hunting for car parts? Always with that verdampt car. Risking your life for  what? To die on the road?"" I mean, we know he was hunting for car parts. We don't need to hear it again. I want something better here that tells us about their relationship without being expositional.  The first conversation is particularly troublesome because this has to be GREAT. This is the first interaction b/w who I assume are our two protagonists. And the very first line Grace says is ""You scared me. Shame on you. And you caught me smoking.""  Think about that line. She's describing exactly what we see. That makes the line a throwaway. And then Silas's reply, ""Your secret is safe with me."" How often have we heard that line?  I know not every line is going to be genius, it's just that I want to be enamored with your leads. I want to be swept up in their conversation. But then instead we get a long drawn out discussion about names, her face on barns (which is actually good) and Silas's car (we get it, he's building a car, this is the third time we've heard/seen about it). It's all exposition and/or boring.  Minor quibble about this Gyre thing... He's speaking to Silas, compelling him to do terrible things, but to Silas it's just an annoyance easily ignored. Maybe that's what you intended, but there's conflict there. If Silas had trouble fighting off the Gyre or at least reacting to it more, it would be more interesting.  Lastly, I just don't care about Silas. I'm not really interested in what's going to happen with his car. That's why I stopped after 10 pages. I think maybe you have to give us more conflict in the beginning. What is so important about this car? What is Silas fighting against? Maybe you introduce this later, but the writing isn't good enough to sustain me until I get there.  Also, who is Silas? I'm not getting much in the way of character here. I want to like him. But right now he seems pretty dull. He's not making choices. He's just going along, his father tells him to deliver a radio. Grace talks to him. He delivers the radio. Grace comes up to him again. He's just very passive. And I think you're missing chances to show us his personality.  In the end, this is one of those, ""it's fine"" scripts. Where technically it's fine but there's nothing special that's reaching out and grabbing me.  Hope this helps. Good luck with it."
Screenwriting,3e31xk,slupo,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:55 2015 UTC,"I stopped coincidentally around page 10 too - lunch is over XD, I can finish it tonight - but I strongly agree with the limitations of your set-up.  I'm kind of having fun, I guess, but I have NO idea what the point is going to be.  I guess Wraithmore is about a boy yearning to leave his post-apocalyptic town and drive his car around?  Probably have some sort of adventure with Grace?  I'm not really sure, and I feel like I ought to have a much better idea by page 10.    Grace's first lines kinda land with the, well, grace of an elephant jumping out of a tree.  ""Shame on you.  And you caught me smoking""  I mean this 100% constructively, but...yeesh.  Not a fan.    It looks like you're heading into something of an action scene with some gang of thugs right where I left off?  If so, I don't like how long it takes to get into meaningful action.  This is action horror, and we've done NOTHING but talk for what, 12 pages?  I mean, bullets echoing in the distance and threatening the life of a rat don't count as action.  I do very much like the vibe, so we'll see what my impressions are after I can finish it, but I wanted to definitely second basically everything slupo said."

Screenwriting,3e31xk,PaulYorick,3,Wed Jul 22 00:08:20 2015 UTC,"I read the first 10, skimmed the next 10.   So ... I scratched my head several times over. Probably nit-picky things, but if something stops me cold and I have to backtrack, then I figure it may be an issue for someone else too. Like right away, in the very first few lines. ""Ruined"" is a strange word. Ruined how -- like dilapidated? Burnt? Old and falling down? Ruined like cannonballs blew it to smithereens?? I have no clue. Whatever, skipped over that. Gently rolling mountains. Gently rolling hills? Or mountains? At first I let myself envision a place like ... oh, Montana. I can see sun-baked farmland and mountains in the distance. But then you say New England. Okay......   Then I hit the word Gyre. So then I feel dumb -- am I supposed to know what a Gyre is?? So I Google it, find something about oceanic something or others, not exactly certain what I'm supposed to be seeing in my mind's eye. Oh, and then it talks! Wait - what?  And I'm only halfway down page 1!! Already feeling lost.   1934 .. after the end ... no idea what this is supposed to mean....... Don't worry -- just go with it.....  Page 2 we get to town ... and it's on the coast! But the same character is here...... but we've just been in the countryside/farmland ... with mountains....... and isn't he on foot? How far apart are these places?? More confusion.  On page 2. No worries, it's early.... So I hang in.   It's rather a tedious read, IMO. Long, languid sentences, reads more like a novel to me. I like scripts that snap and hum along ..... and this was billed as horror and action, so the pace of this wasn't exactly what I expected.   Then -- some little things. Like on p 2 --- calling out things in a rucksack. Like IN the rucksack? Have they spilled out? Is it lying open? I'm sure what YOU SEE is very clear in your mind, but not everything is translating through for me on the page.  p 3 when the Gyre speaks while the boy's in the presence of the guardsmen ... so -- can anyone/everyone hear it? Or .... how do we know/differentiate who/when/if.....  The setting up of Wraithmore the town was .. odd. Gunfire on a wall after sunset, lovers in the square, people ignore the gunfire. I didn't think too hard -- just ""went with it"". Slightly curious.   Little thing, but do your research. For example, on p 5 there are guards in ""a battered Mercury"". In 1934. Mercury was launched in 1938. Okay, yeah -- whoopdee do, but it's just such an easy thing to check, why not do so? If you're gonna be semi-true to a period...  p 6 I said Thank you, Gracie! I was thinking the same thing about the name Falconer. (Back to the intro of the dad, HOW DO WE KNOW he's German??? Accent? Germans don't have a particular ""look""......  I was already ""out of the story"" by this point, I didn't think too hard about Silas's dad talking about the Gyre, or mentioning Tesla ...... was in smile and nod mode.  p 10 - the night into day scene..... Stopped me cold. Am I supposed to know what a Nightkind Monster is?? What they look like? I thought the term NIGHTKIND MONSTER didn't even emerge until after p 10. Started to check, but...   By the time I hit Gracie with the other dude and Dorath and his thug-buddies and the chase scene, I didn't know what the heck was going on, so I skimmed a bit further and then bailed.  Not sure what else to say...... I tried."

Dialog needs work to be honest, too many characters have the same voice.  The gyre works, as a reader I understood the image you want to show, BUT you should describe the voice if the Gyre, is it loud and booming, is it gentle?   Also, age up silas.

There's some good ideas that I like, but I don't think they're really being taken advantage of in a way that feels fully imagined and cinematic. Those are my general thoughts. Here's a few notes I made while reading:  No one is ever going to sync their reading with the music. Whatever it is the music is supposed to convey, you have to evoke it with words. And you have to do it with few words, and organically so that the reading experience flows smoothly, and it's fucking hard as shit. That's your job as a screenwriter. This isn't beyond the limits of screenwriting. This is the hard work of screenwriting.   Pages 77 and 78 have some repeated descriptions.   weird bit of dialog on page 82 when silas talks twice and doesn't make much sense.  A scene seem to be out of order. You've got a scene of Millicent flying to the dark ship, but then later a scene that seems like it's meant to introduce the dark ship."

Screenwriting,3e31xk,Yourcockystrut,2,Tue Jul 21 19:50:50 2015 UTC,"It seemed strange that when Silas heads out to help Grace, it's too easy for him to leave. When he passes the guards at the start, they're quite stern about him getting back before dark etc. Might be better to have him sneak out again, or overcome something to do so, seems like a good place to add more tension with his father for constantly leaving. Also the ""class"" difference between Silas and Grace wavers sometimes but this is nitpicking related to the world-building hurdle. It's difficult to establish that gap, might work if you make Grace initially a bit unlikable and then when Silas saves her, her change of perspective etc. although it's better as the story continues. The voice of the Gyre is an interesting aspect, adds a twist. For impact though, again I'd want to see the struggle Silas experiences with it early. Maybe when his father gives him the pistol, he comes close to killing him.   Otherwise, format and all is great. Easy to read. Haven't finished all of it yet but will send some more notes as I go through."

I know that quantity=/=quality, but it's the easiest way for me to write comedy, at least to start with, because then I know which jokes work and which don't.   As far as length, there's practically no downtime with no jokes right now, and I already have 70 pages, and the plot isn't resolved. Are you saying I should split it into parts (for a sequel, which is more than a little optimistic) so that it's that short, or that I should just cut 50+ pages of material so I can finish the plot?"
Screenwriting,3e5k0t,quietplaces,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:30:44 2015 UTC,"Hello!  If you are able to cut 50 pages (ostensibly because that's 50 pages of jokes that don't move the plot forward), then you should cut the 50 pages and work to write a 90-100 page script that has jokes and also moves the plot forward.  I'm also curious as to what you mean when you say that you're trying to ""make the plot fit logically with the jokes."" In a screenplay, there MUST be a coherent plot--even if it is a comedy. Take a look at any great comedy that's been released (as I assume you're looking to make/sell/distribute this bad boy) and you will see that there is a plot (sometimes very thin) that resolves itself by the end of the script.   If you're more interested in telling a string of unconnected jokes that don't move one story forward, maybe consider turning them into a standup act?"

What's the closest thing we have to that these days -- an Adam Sandler or a Friedberg-Seltzer parody movie? Adam Sandler gets by on his name alone, while the parody movies have carved out a niche of their own from the days of Scary Movie.   Despite being universally panned by critics, these movies make lots of money at the box office. I mean, they wouldn't keep making them if they weren't commercially successful. There's definitely a market for these movies (kids, teenagers, their parents, old people), but everyone else will think you've written a terribly unfunny movie.  I guess the contemporary term for these types of movies is ""family comedy"", but it's way too easy to fuck things up (comedic tone being super important) and before you even know it, you've accidentally written Paul Blart Mall Cop."

Screenwriting,3e0qh8,maskedfox007,2,Tue Jul 21 01:48:51 2015 UTC,My favourite advice from Graham Linehan (I'm pretty sure it was him) was that you shouldn't just sit down and try to write something. Instead you should build up lots and lots of ideas until you're bursting (or it's burning a hole in you).   His analogy of trying to write before you're at this stage was that it's like trying to squeeze out a poo before it's ready.
Screenwriting,3e0inj,November11th,22,Tue Jul 21 00:44:53 2015 UTC,"You need to get better at writing scenes.  Get a script to a movie you like and study the scenes.  They are mostly 2-3 pages long, and are about one dramatic idea.  Practice writing a dramatic scene in 2-3 pages.  You need a beginning, a middle and an end.  Generally, a scene is about a character who wants something.  They find resistance, and try to overcome it.  They either get what they want, don't get what they want, or change their mind about wanting it.  In the middle of the scene there is usually a moment of escalation which raises the stakes, either by raising the threat or raising the cost of failure.  There is also usually a moment of revelation where the character, the audience or both learn something new and significant to do with the story.  Try to start the scene as late as possible.  Cut all the description of people walking, driving, entering, greeting -- unless there's something important and special about it.  Try to leave the scene as soon as you have resolved the idea of the scene.  Don't hang around; get out.  Once you've written a handful of practice scenes, and you're getting a feeling for the 2-3 page form, buy 100 index cards and a Sharpie.  Count out 48 index cards.  Those are your scenes.  If each scene is 2-3 pages long, you'll end up with a 120-page script.  Divide the cards into 8 piles of 6 cards each.  Each pile is 12-15 pages, or half an act.  USC calls them sequences, other folks call them reels.  It's just a way of breaking the script into smaller chunks to make it manageable.  Think of each pile being a little story that's part of the bigger story.  Those 6 cards together are about something, then you transition to the next build in your script.  Remember that each card gets one short headline with one narrative idea.  ""Starlord steals the Orb and escapes in his ship"" is not a scene.  It actually implies three scenes:  ""Starlord steals the Orb""  ""Starlord gets caught"" ""Starlord Escapes.""  Sit down and brainstorm ideas for scenes.  Put them in the piles where you think they belong, and rearrange them later.  When you have 48 cards written out, and they feel like they're in the right order, start writing the scenes.  You don't have to write them in order.  If you follow these steps, you'll never end up short on your page count again.  Good luck."

For way more information on writing great prose than anyone really wants to know check out Rhetorical Grammar, by Martha Kolln. I especially think her explanation of end focus is extremely important and also how to switch between active and passive to achieve the result."
Screenwriting,3e0inj,HotspurJr,4,Tue Jul 21 15:15:22 2015 UTC,"Take your scripts. From your finished script, outline them.   Take films that you consider your script to be like - genre, tone, etc - and outline the finished film.   Compare outlines.   If they are approximately equal in length, your problem is in your scene-level work. You're not exploiting scenes enough. If your outline is much shorter, you need to develop your stories to include more complexity."

Screenwriting,3e0inj,TadBitter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:12:23 2015 UTC,"It's ok.    You can also show that you're aware of running time, by making sure you start scenes on their ""page hit."" For example, let's suppose in your version, the central conflict hits on page 4 because the scenes leading up to it are action stuff that only take a few lines to write. No problem, just insert a page break. It's ok that the page is only 1 paragraph. You're letting the reader and filmmakers know ""I got this shit. Trust me."" You'll want to page break so that your central conflict and all the other ""page hits"" are where they should be -- Noting also that ""where they should be"" will change over time depending on what's in fashion.  Many screenplays do this and it may seem weird to your eyes at first but it shouldn't. This is just part of the format. Screenplay formatting gets even more detailed once the scenes have been locked and the rewrites start pouring in. A director/producer might look at your script and think, ""I have lots of space to make my vision,"" so from that POV formatting in the way I describe can be a plus. Read ""Return to Paradise"" (1998) for an example (if you can find it).  Alternatively, if your act break scene is running long, it's ok from time to time to call it page 29A, so Act 2 starts on page 30."
Screenwriting,3e0g9s,TeamDonnelly,3,Tue Jul 21 00:25:11 2015 UTC,"We begin on a Hunter Killer (HK) as it flies over a destroyed LA, a rubbled NYC, ash-stricken London, nuclear-wintered Giza, etc. (we haven't seen global ramifications on ground level/this would visually be unique for a Terminator film).  Act 1:  The HK finds a small batch of humans, led by a man named James Kasden, and looks to destroy them... but doesn't. Through exposition, we find out that the End of the War as been resolved for multiple decades, the machines and humans are in peace (due to John Connor's past heroics/sacrifice, destroying the main operating system at Skynet, etc.) but all of that was at a cost... the world isn't hospitable any longer and human life is dying due to food shortage, radiation, etc.   With John Connor a Messiah type (a theme from Salvation), the stories about time travel, Sarah, Kyle and the T-800 are now fables to a majority of the people. He is a Savior to some but a False Prophet to others, as this has all led to inevitable death. But James was brought up with hope and a fight to survive, hence why is a leader to this group.   Through exposition from the HK, we learn that Skynet's main headquarters is in LA and the Time Machine is there. This gives James the idea to go there, go back in time and stop all of this from happening (even if that means wiping his own existence out in the process).   James embarks the mission via the HK (who he calls Hunter). He learns the machines are not all 'friendly"" (Hunter tells him that the programming is off in them) and some remaining humans are Road Warrior-type crazies. We have a nice set-piece, avoiding humans and the rogue machines (resolving with our hero having the humans/machines fight each other through wit).  They make it to LA, at Skynet but Hunter is too big (obviously) to go inside, opts to be synched to a bluetooth-like device so it can assist James (similar to the Cortona/Master Chief dynamic in the Halo series) and they proceed into the destroyed infrastructure.   Another set-piece as James must survive multiple T-800-like machine's, small Hunter Killers and even a T-1001 (a slightly advanced model on everyone's fav baddie) as he makes his way to the Time Machine. But why is Skynet defensive?   James and Hunter have a nice moment in this sequence, plan the year he will go back to (Hunter finds that 2002 is the best solution/a year before T3's Judgement Day occurs) as they make it to the Time Machine. Hunter indicates the rules of travel (no clothes/electronics or you are destroyed) and James inputs the bluetooth-like device into the Skynet tech. This begins to power up the machine but now more machines are approaching.  James says farewell and thank you to his new ally as Hunter defends the area and as the first act ends.    Act 2:  Begins with James in 2002, appearing in an alley; steals a bums clothes (like T1).  In a different location, we then see the time bubble appear and a severed hand is seen. A random dog picks it up and runs off. Through audio, the dog whelps--gets killed--as it is apparent a shapeshifting Terminator is now on the hunt (the T-1001).   Back to James, he does investigative work on a government-financed Cyberdyne branch (based somewhere North) and sets out to assassinate General Robert Brewster (from T3), who is running the operation.   James sees a wondering dog approach him. As the dog continues to pace toward him, it morphs into a silver, man-sized T-1001 (this scene can be completely ridiculous). Before James can react, he is saved from a T-800 model (the Arnold type) and the two machines duke it out.   A vehicular chase occurs as James/the T-800 drive from the T-1001. We learn that Hunter programed a T-800 and went back in time to assist his ally. Then why the T-1001? Hunter theorizes that was Skynet defending itself from being wiped out after it saw the T-800 going back (a nice reversal from the franchise).  A massive car chase happens, they are followed by helicopters, etc. The T-1001 (knowing it can't be seen because Skynet isn't ready yet) morphs away as police cars follow James and Hunter.   They are caught and taken to a government facility. James is questioned and the T-800 is ultra-quaranteened as General Brewster looks on in wonder (how do these people have this advanced tech.. the tech he is currently working on).   We have exposition from Brewster about Cyberdyne and that James/the T-800 will be tested, etc. Brewster leaves; James self-doubts his decisions and how he failed.   The lights of the facility go out, a flash grenade is seen outside James' cell and the sound of guards dying is heard. Is this the T-1001? The door blasts open and... John Connor is in the door-way--sporting Spec-Op-like gear and with a squad of soldiers.  ""Come with me if you wanna live."" says John (the studio will love this) ""Only with my Hunter Killer"" says James.    Act 3:  John, James and Hunter are seen flying in a military-type stealth helicopter, with exposition from Conner: he saw the news coverage, recognized the T-800, the T-1001 and knew this would come--Judgement Day. He has been training for this his entire life and his squad comprises family and military friends of Enrique Salceda (the same family that helped Sarah in T2). James is handed a picture of Sarah (THE picture) and remarks on how beautiful she is.   We go to John's base in Mexico, where we have a ""down"" moment. The facility is amazing. If there is a Judgement Day, this would make a good headquarters. There is a real ""family"" dynamic here (similar to T2) and James is taken aback from this (as he lived in Hell essentially).    The new mission--prevent Judgement Day by assassinating Brewster/blowing up Cyberdyne--the three begin to plot out the attack.  Failure is not an option.   They scout Cyberdyne--a military base in Alaska--and John, James, Hunter and Conner's troops stealth-helicopter over there.  A Zero Dark Thirty-like sequence is seen, infiltrating the ground, taking out guards, etc. Everyone talks via earpieces; spec-ops like. John and James get inside with Hunter planting explosives around the premises (and for dramatic purposes).  They confront Brewster; he is surprised, how crazy this is, he isn't a bad person, etc. As John is about to make a killer shot the T-1001 appears from the ground, waiting for them (like T2) and stops the assassination (Brewster is freaking out at this as well).  John/James shoot the thing. Hunter hears this and proceeds to go inside but the cold has made its joints rigid and is difficult to walk, etc.   A scary, tight-corridor survival scene proceeds as the T-1001 is hunting Conner's men--similar to Alien (...or T1). As it is about to get John/James, Hunter appears and begins to fight the T-1001 in hand to hand combat (like T2).  John/James confront Brewster and tells him what is going to happen, Judgement Day, etc.  Hunter is losing, getting its arm destroyed, face smashed, etc. James goes out to defend as they must leave as the facility is going to blow.   John talks to Brewster how the future tech can't be found, experimented with or worked on because someone will find a way to reverse engineer it, etc.   James and Hunter are fighting the T-1001; Hunter gets severely hit as James looks vulnerable.   Brewster talks to John how killing him won't solve anything as other, more important, people know more than him but he will help The Resistance now. John/Brewster agree to escape/the T-1001 picks up on this, focusing its attention to them.   James tries to get Hunter walking but can't. Hunter tells James to leave but will be here (points to his earpiece/harking back to how they became allies in the first place).   The T-1001 continues to stalk John/Brewster as Hunter limps after them.   They make it to the main entrance and John's stealth helicopter is there, waiting for them, before the place blows. It is freezing cold.  The T-1001 catches them, spikes John's leg and throws Brewster. It doesn't immediately kill Conner and begins to turn its finger into a sharp point toward the middle of his eyes (like in T2). Brewster is hurt and can't do anything.   James is following the path as Hunter is telling him where to go (the T-800 sees everything, again from T2) and reaches the outside, yells and gets the Machines attention.   But James is too late and John Conner is dead!  The T-1001 looks triumphant as it finally killed the person to lead The Resistance.   James, furious, shoots the T-1001 multiple times (seen in every Terminator) but when the Machine looks to make a counter measure--it can't. The cold is making it too frigid. In a last ditch effort, the T-1001 elongates its fingers into sharp spears at the humans but before it reaches them the cold has done its part.   James realizes this place is going to blow grabs Brewster, placing him in the helicopter, while also grabbing the recently killed Conner.    As James pilots the helicopter, Hunter tells him farewell and thank you to his new ally (a reversal from the beginning) and the whole place blows.  The helicopter lands in Mexico and Brewster tells James he will work with him to fight. James then buries John's body but keeps the picture of Sarah.   It is then seen that James--not John Conner--is the person who is meant to lead the human resistance. The person who was willing to wipe out his own existence is the person that ultimately has all the power to change such a thing in the first place.  The film ends with James establishing his leadership among the Mexico facility.   The End.   End credits are people going through rubble in the snow. They end up finding the frozen T-1001.   Cut to black.   Duh da Duh da DUH!"

I think Neil Blomkamp is the best example of the ticking time bomb being used to the story's detriment. Each film has an implicit timeframe, and by Chappie it's just lazy. ""The battery will expire so you better grow as a character by then."" The mechanics of it makes sense (the battery can't be changed and that's why Chappie exists in the first place) but its introduction just screams ""I needed to add urgency.""

In Shawshank, when Andy gets a new avenue forward, he starts working towards it right away. This even gets him into trouble when he finds the guy who actually murdered his wife and gets him killed. Yes, his final plan requires patience ... but it's not like Andy is sitting on his butt waiting to get started. He's quieting digging away every night.   One could, if one squinted, even say that a lot of Andy's journey in that film is learning how to not charge full speed at whatever the ""obvious"" solution is and to adopt a more deliberate and patient approach.

Screenwriting,3e127e,DickHero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:24:46 2015 UTC,"It's a bit of a Catch-22.  If you throw specific songs around willy-nilly, it can seem like you're trying to be an auteur without any intentionality behind it. So if you're going to call out a specific song (and your name is not Cameron Crowe or Quentin Tarantino), make sure there is a clear, intentional decision behind why it needs to be that song and not another song that sounds like it.  The flipside, as others have said, is that rights to use songs are often prohibitively expensive. So if you hope to actually get the movie made (as opposed to just having it as a writing sample), don't make any key plot moments dependent on getting a specific song.  The unofficial guideline I've started to give myself is to call out songs if and only if the use of that specific song in that specific moment is a meaningful demonstration of voice."

On the other hand, it's better for business to have long-running shows of high quality. Dependable, popular shows.

Screenwriting,3e1hku,Iswitt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:47:39 2015 UTC,"I hope so!  If I have learned anything from True Detective, it is that a great short series, with a defined beginning and end, is powerful and memorable.  So often in American television, we have left the mini-series to poorly written, weakly acted melodramas (Roots and a handful of others being a notable exceptions).  That seems to be changing with the renewed popularity of HBO and the rise of streaming services.  That being said, I had hoped that Netflix would end House of Cards after its inaugural season, as it had such a powerful ending.  Yet, Netflix decided for profits and to satisfy old American expectations over quality and continues to run the show with lessening degrees of success.  But, I feel that there is much more openness to longer serial stories that can't be captured in a two-hour film, nor have the episodic staying power of a multi-season run."

I don't know if that means the format is more popular or just that my project might be better suited to that format, but surely the fact that it's even being suggested is indicative of their thoughts on what might become a trend.   I told all of them that I did think it could be expanded, and I'd be happy to discuss specifics, but made it clear (without outright stating) that I wouldn't adapt it on spec. At best I'd be willing to do a treatment for the first episode. Writing a full miniseries on spec seems like a poor investment of time to me whether there is more interest in the format or not."

But whether or not it's gaining popularity is a really interesting question. In Europe, I think, there's a stronger tradition for mini-series. One of the standard formats in England is 6 episodes pr. season, meaning that if you cancel after season 1, it's technically a mini.   In Denmark(where I live) and Norway, we use mini-series to make big-budget shows. Our networks cannot afford to make long shows about historical topics for example, so we use the mini format to that instead.   In Denmark, 1864, was the most expensive series ever, and it was in 6 episodes. In Norway, ""Kampen om Tungtvannet"" was equally the most expensive show ever, and as far as I recall in 6 episodes.   I do believe we'll see more mini-series coming from the U.S in the coming years."

Write all the time. Read screenplays and books. Watch films. Develop your voice. Meet other writers, directors, actors, etc. Try to make some stuff if you can. Even stupid/silly stuff that you'll be embarrassed about in ten years. Learn about the industry. Try for internships in the industry or relevant fields using your English/Journalism/Business/etc. degree (just my personal recommendations for best relevant majors to pick). You'll know just as much as any film major, but you'll have a much more well-rounded resume.  I switched my major from Film/Screenwriting to Economics/English after two years, and I haven't regretted it for a second. In fact, I've done all my best writing since the switch (more exposure to non-film reading and writing, great skill-honers) and I actually have useful knowledge and skills outside of the film industry which make me employable. Which is what you'll want to be when those student loans need to be repaid. And in my opinion, frankly, the better job you can snag after college, the less financially stressed you'll be.

Screenwriting,3e0nzm,pushingaterd,2,Tue Jul 21 01:28:34 2015 UTC,I can tell you this. Having a title that can't be pronounced by someone that hasn't heard it said out loud is worse than it giving no clue to what might you are going to watch/read. Might want to revise that.
Screenwriting,3e0nzm,senpainoodles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:06:30 2015 UTC,"Look, I'm not your target audience--I hated Game of Thrones (though I do love the Matter of Britain). Some points:   Find a tone and stick to it. The opening exchange had a consistent tone until ""Oh god yes."" Nobody in the time period, least of all a highborn princess, would blaspheme like that. If you want to make it all faux Medieval, go for it. If you want to make it modern, go for it. A mix of the two is gonna snap your audience out of their disbelief. However, the rest of the show is remarkably consistent. Definitely agree with /u/senpainoodles about the title. When did you change from Chains to the Welsh for Excalibur? As well as it being unpronounceable, it isn't catchy or clever--unless you're planning on this only airing on BBC Wales. Also, you don't call it Caledfwlch in the show, you call it Excalibur. After Meridis' death, we don't have a viewpoint character--a character unfamiliar with the world of the lowborn, who can be bemused with us. I guess Arenia serves this purpose? I'm not sure just how much she knows, but she seems to know a lot. Maybe Valora will? You follow a character completely for the first two acts, and then completely disorient us. Consider mixing the plotlines up a little (unless this was the intended effect, of course)? In addition, considering Valora seems to be the most important plotline, add a little more flesh to her scenes. The innkeeper scene seemed pointless for a pilot--consider relocating that to a future episode (it seems better for a second episode). How do the plots connect? Unless I skimmed it too lightly, it seems that they don't have any relation at the moment. The logline is insufficient--how does the Arenia plotline figure into this?   Overall though, it was gripping. Arenia and Gregarious were intriguing, though I found the nobility scenes less interesting. I did like the innkeeper scene--it was quite Holmesian--but, like I said, it would do better when you're not trying to set up an overarching plotline.  Anyway, I hope this wasn't too long."
Screenwriting,3dzh8a,BosskHogg,3,Mon Jul 20 20:03:32 2015 UTC,"Hey there.  I like the premise. I'm a few pages in. The formatting/layout is odd, IMO. Spacing needs to be addressed, and you separate too many sentences. Throws me off a bit. But your writing style is great overall. One thing that is crucial is to keep the ""ing"" out of the action. That is, keep the use of present continuous verbs down to a bare minimum. It helps keep things punchy and drags us into the script.   Also, consider revising the ""something out of a Pixar film"" line. You communicated that well enough after you said cute. Less is more. Manipulate the reader into picking how they see it. I would also cut down on some of the camera direction. Some of it is cool and sets tone, but leave it few and far between. This isn't a shooting script, (not yet, anyway).

Always get people to assume it's your first, and best work. Would you tell someone you assembled a bicycle you wanted to sell twice before you got it right? The opening is strong, though I wanted something to become of that bump in the night, so to speak. A backpack is worn on the back. The statement is redundant. I'd cut it. ""Behind him, a droid follows. A CLEANING DROID - small, cute something out of a Pixar film."" I would make it like this: ""Behind him, a CLEANING DROID follows- small, cute."" It's enough. ""It releases a series of disgruntled beeps as it tries to keep up"" Line revision, maybe? Is the classroom scene a montage? It reads like one. If so, it needs editing to reflect it. Mistake on page 3, ""+dresser"" 2/3 down the page. A great line ""A trophy case of scavenged memories belonging to other people"" Can be made better: ""A trophy case of scavenged memories- just not his.""   Okay so that's all I should write for now. Whatever you do, don't get discourage. This work is great. The imagery is something akin to Kubrick meets Hill. It's clear you are going for that style and it works. What I'm not clear on so far is tone. I would imagine that a boy along in space would be, unlike myself, a man of few words. Socially retarded, even. He should speak in simple sentences. An example would be when he asks about damage. Shorten it to just ""Damage?"". Not only does this work for sci-fi and give it a sense of efficiency, it can work to showcase his lack of social skills also.  By all means take this with a grain of salt, as I'm not pro myself. I can't wait for the next, ""first"" draft.  :)  Best of luck to you."

This script today would get picked up in a heartbeat. It's beautiful and tight and the characters are fantastic. What do you think has changed so much in 15 years? Hollywood stopped making great characters dramedies? The Descendants? Silver Linings Playbook? And don't say those are adaptations, those were tiny books.   Nearly every scene in American Beauty is note perfect. You don't see a lot of movies like it being made because it has a very original tone. Who called it overrated? It won the Oscar!   P.S.

The Pedophilia/statutory rape wouldn't be as welcomed either. Wasn't there a scene where the wife hugs her clothes. Talk about telegraphed writing. Times have changed a lot, and a ton of those elements got left in the dust with social acceptability, and others are just clunky.

I still don't totally understand what I am suppose to take away from this movie. That if you lose your balls you will be unhappy. Lester is the only guy in the movie like that, so doesn't really cover a large area of the population. He hates his wife, his job and has the hots for his daughters friend, so he quits his job, stopped caring about his wife, and pursued a relationship with a high school girl. That is a shitty logline. What is this movie teaching me, or warning me, or trying to get me to talk about. Have purpose in life, I guess. But if that is the case why is his last voice over making him to seem like an enlightened guy. He was unhappy, so he did rejected convention, did what ever he wanted, pissed people off and got killed by misunderstanding. It isn't ironic that he got killed through misunderstanding, they just needed to end the movie.  It is also always bugged me that he blackmailed his way out of the company. You could have atleast made him the one truly honest character in the movie, who doesn't cheat. Then what does he do, he goes and works in a fast food restaurant. You could not be more of a cog in the machine than a line cook.   It is a massive extreme of a midlife crisis. The wife, while somewhat emotionally abusive at worst, isn't actually a bad person in the movie. Her reactions are more justifiable than his. The daughter, being a teenager and already hating her parents, finds more of a reason to resent his existence. The kid is repressed. The father is so stereotypical. If I told you I was writing a hardass character that was a homophobic closeted gay with a collection of guns, you would say what is his rank in the military.  Lester is made to be this hero when he just isn't.   You can't dissect this movie and say it makes a ton of sense, and today, the way it is written, just doesn't hold up. It was successful because it was artsy looking and had a good demographic of teenagers to 49 year old midlife crisis people."

Holds up fine, for me. The boy could exist as-is in 1955 as well as 2015. The father's homophobia is common today, just not with people you know, I guess. The V.O. is from the POV of a dead guy. I imagine he has a few insights we don't.   Straight men (of any age) want to fuck nubile young women, it's just the basic atavistic desire to reproduce as successfully as possible. The girl presents herself as sexually active and comes on to the Dad. She wasn't 13, it's hardly pedophilia. His humanity shows when he finds out it's all an act and he doesn't screw her, because emotionally she is about 13.  He doesn't hate his wife, he loves his wife, he would like the woman he fell in love with to reappear. Only a woman you love has the power to hurt you as much as she hurts him.   No one is a bad person or a good person, there are just a lot of people dealing the best they can at the moment with the moment they are in.   That you didn't like or understand the film doesn't make it bad or irrelevant today. Now, I personally think Citizen Kane is a waste of film stock.  But I wouldn't bother writing about it, because it didn't mean anything to me but some wasted time.   You started a thread just to diss this movie and have been going on about it for a while.

Fight Club gets unfairly put into this category of violent for being violent for those that don't get it, completely stripping its themes.

They are NOT in a relationship, the 16/17 year old is being sexually abused by his teacher.  You didn't do any research into this subject matter and it shows.  There are hundreds of stories of teachers having sex with minors and those teaches end up in jail (where they belong).  If you feel strongly about this story then do your homework and start researching by reading articles and taking notes at any bit of information that jumps out at you.  That the brain's way of assimilating bits of information that it will need to formulate a story.  Read about the psychological aspects of these teachers that likes to have sex with underage kids.  It's a power thing on their part.  Try to understand what's going on in the teachers mind and what's going on in the students mind.  And if word got out amongst the students, and whispers started how would that affect the student: emotionally, psychologically.  From there: start writing, don't ""force"" the story, based on the bits of info you've assimilated during your research the story will follow a natural progression as it unfolds - because through your research you've given the brain concrete information to reference and work with.  When you do your research, it shows in your writing.   I'm a former script reader and I'll sometimes analyze scripts for a few friends out in LA (I don't do it often 'cause it's too time consuming) and one of the biggest problems it they don't research the subject they are writing about. I received a script a few weeks ago for a film about cigarette smuggling that my friend was in the process of raising funds for.  I scanned it, then start researching on the internet all I could find about cigarette smuggling.  I called him up and asked ""is this a straight to video film or what?"" because the way it was written that's exactly where it would end up.  Then I asked him to tell me what he knew about the cigarette smuggling business.  He knew nothing except that some guy he met had smuggled a few carton and he thought it would make a good story.  By the time we got off the phone and I'd gone through my schemel, I'd shown him that by switching the story around where the focus is a character study of the dynamics between a family and friends who just happen to be cigarette smugglers and how being busted affected their lives made the story infinitely more interesting.  Essentially these people with no marketable skill sets were living the high life, spending like crazy to maintain a status and now the source of income was gone.

Screenwriting,3dyv0t,slushpileplayer,15,Mon Jul 20 17:26:30 2015 UTC,"Okay, first of all, the notion that you have more creative freedom in television is sort of a lie.   Yeah, if you're Vince Gilligan, you have creative freedom. But the guys show running procedurals on the big-4 networks are getting a ton of notes on every episode. Pilots are extensively developed. Networks offer notes on episodes at the concept, treatment, and draft level. No, you can't get stuck in development hell in the same way, because there's a deadline coming up (production) but you are dealing with network notes ALL THE TIME.   And even the big boys, look - The Wire was in the middle of being hailed as the greatest show of all time when HBO cut its final-season episode order from 12 to 10.   And if you want to point and a handful of writer-producers who have incredible creative freedom in television, we could also point to Quentin Tarantino, Steven Spielberg, Paul Thomas Anderson, etc - guys who have that sort of freedom in film. The pinnacle is the pinnacle. Yeah, Matt Weiner, Vince Gilligan, and Shonda Rhimes have tremendous power but Shonda Rhimes is every bit as exceptional as Steven Spielberg, from a creative power standpoint. She is perhaps the most extreme outlier there is.   As far as creative control, the vast majority of TV writers have FAR less than the average film writer. If you're the film writer, you're usually hired for your voice, for what YOU bring to the project. Whereas the majority of the staff on a TV show is doing their best to write in the show's voice, and the guy who is going to rewrite them if they fail to do that has already been hired.   Ultimately, though, the creative freedom the top show-runners get is more than the top film writers get because of time. Marvel is currently developing film projects that won't go in front of the cameras for three years - by design. Kevin Feige has all the time in the world to shape the writers' work into what he wants.   Meanwhile, the first episode of the next season of How To Get Away With Murder started shooting TODAY. The writers started working together about two months ago. Yeah, you can bet the network got its notes in (even with Shonda involved to minimize them), but there simply wasn't time for the kind of endless circling that happens in the film world."

That somebody expects to make more money than they put in so can bet your bottom dollar that even the most respected showrunners and film producers will still get notes from the networks and film studios. Maybe not as many as an unknown guy/girl would get but I am pretty sure that there is no such thing as zero studio/network interference."

Screenwriting,3dyv0t,happybarfday,2,Mon Jul 20 19:24:32 2015 UTC,"You're sort of glossing over the biggest and most important difference in tv and film. In TV, once you reach mid level (and there are lots of mid level tv writers) you are a producer on the project. And not a producer in name only. You are sitting on set giving your director notes and shaping the episode. That is a level of creative control that doesn't exist in film unless you are Simon Kinberg or one of the other 3-5 writer producers who actually mean something. There are other differences too - writers actually getting their own cut, control of casting etc but I think the producing element really differentiates tv and movie writing."
Screenwriting,3dyv0t,paulmetzler,12,Tue Jul 21 01:48:27 2015 UTC,Film is making a ton of money. It's dead creatively is what they are saying.
Screenwriting,3dyv0t,Lookout3,6,Mon Jul 20 17:34:48 2015 UTC,"I watched ""Superman Lives: the death of superman"" the other day and a guy on there said ""there is nothing Hollywood craves more than an original script, but nothing that scares them off quicker than originality."""
Screenwriting,3dyv0t,paperfisherman,4,Mon Jul 20 17:55:00 2015 UTC,"Inherently, writers in TV have always had more control than writers in movies.  There's less (budgetary) money on the line, and because production has to move so fast, there's no real time for executives to spend time ""developing"" each individual episode script.  This has been true since the beginning of TV in the 1950s.  That being said, I've heard similar things from some executives: ""If you're interested in going into TV, go into TV."" Which is less about creative power but about opportunity.  There's way more opportunities to get things made in TV now than movies.  More buyers, more distribution channels, etc."
Screenwriting,3dyv0t,Iswitt,3,Mon Jul 20 18:15:57 2015 UTC,I hope people pay attention to this advice. That means the film realm will get less crowded and I might have a better shot ;-).
Screenwriting,3dyv0t,thehollowman84,3,Mon Jul 20 17:52:56 2015 UTC,"It's a money thing. In TV it costs a couple of million, a couple of months to make a pilot. Then you can get almost instant feedback with low marketing costs. So networks can say ""Go for it"", throw a bunch of pilots at the wall and see what sticks. Just one successful show will likely make back the money for ten.   So the risk is far far lower in TV. If you don't pick up a pilot, it probably cost $3 million at the most? Maybe a little more, but less than $10 million. You fuck up a movie though? That's potentially hundreds of millions gone. If a studio has a big ol' flop, that affects their bottom line hard. That affects their profit margins. People are getting fired for that shit.   So it all comes down to risk thresholds. Any time you are creative, or let someone be creative you're taking a pretty big risk. It's a risk because you're creating something new. You don't know how the market will react. Maybe people will love this idea. Maybe they'll hate it, who knows. But in TV the cost of failure is fairly low. In film the cost of failure is high.  So in film, execs are looking to mitigate risks, and one of the main ways is inhibiting creativity and the introduction of new ideas. Instead, it's far less risky to follow formulas, and play it safe. Why make a bet that allowing a director to do anything will make $500 million off of $100 million budget, when you KNOW for a fact based on research and past projects that playing it safe will definitely make at least $300? You don't make that bet."
Screenwriting,3dyv0t,3pence,2,Mon Jul 20 18:13:18 2015 UTC,Films are subject financially to the international audience which means to the execs there is a very tight creative package they need to be delivered in.  Television has a better (more narrowly) defined audience with advertisers and subscribers willing to pay. This allows for niche content that ends up taking life of its own as the television audience allows for better feedback to the show runners to explore characters and plot much deeper than movies.
Screenwriting,3dyv0t,PartlyWriter,2,Mon Jul 20 18:30:22 2015 UTC,"Another reason why head writers (showrunners) wield more power in TV is because they are in charge of massively complex and evolving stories. That's the nature of TV. They need a showrunner with that encyclopedic knowledge of the characters, stories, etc and keep the train moving toward a conclusion. Ownership of that is firmly in the hands of the writing staff.  In TV, showrunners bring the story to completion... not directors (who are often hired guns for single episodes)  In film, the story is locked at a certain point and then it's in control of director to bring it to completion. Therefore, they - and producers - can have final say. In TV, a showrunner can battle a note by saying, ""If we do that, it'll mess up the long arc."" In film, the arc is contained in one document so producers/studios/directors feel they have the ability to manipulate it. There isn't some long-term story point to consider."

Act 1, is when the story starts the the horses come out of the gates. The announcer introduces all of the horses and riders so we get to know them.  And the race is started. Act 1 the story is started.  Act 2 , is when the horses and riders get their stride on. The race starts to take shape just like your story should. It picks up steam gaining the interest of the reader. Some get ahead, some fall behind and the story / rage intensifies.  Act 3, is when the horses and riders are rounding for the finish line. It's all out for everyone and with the story coming to an end, it's a finish that will leave everyone talking.  I know it sounds silly, but it's always been an easy way for me to explain to people.  Hope this helps."

Screenwriting,3dx6e9,tim_2,3,Mon Jul 20 07:23:33 2015 UTC,I find it interesting when the reveal completely shifts the theme of the movie eg Atonement.... which I thought was a masterpiece... I'd probably write the real story first and then twist it after the fact...
Screenwriting,3dx6e9,2wenty4frames,2,Mon Jul 20 12:19:38 2015 UTC,"Funny to see the dislike for untruthful narrators, when in fact a movie generally liked on this subreddit (I think) and directed by a generally well-regarded director featured one: The Wolf of Wall Street.   Because our narrator there is constantly substituting lie for fact. What complicates this is that we only see actual evidence of it in one scene: the infamous quaaludes/car scene. From there, however, we can assume that not everything in the movie is happening quite the way we see it happening.   Which leads us to say that Jordan's character is at heart a pathological liar. At the end of the day, his goal is to demonstrate to people his accumulated wealth and power and ask: ""wouldn't you want to be me?"" Indeed, it's shown throughout the film that he'll go to any length to preserve that lifestyle, even so far as to distort the truth and refuse ""leaving his throne"" to escape the authorities.   So yes, a lying narrator can be used well. You just have to be as smart as Winter & Scorsese."
Screenwriting,3dx6e9,spyhunter200,5,Mon Jul 20 16:10:28 2015 UTC,"I'm a real fan of 'unreliable narrator' - with a big exception: When the narrator is deliberately lying to the audience.  But when it's done without the narrator deliberately deceiving the audience - it's a thing of wonder.  Forrest Gump is probably the most famous example of the kind that I like - Forrest is never trying to deceive the audience .. he's narrating his life story how he sees it.  And the audience understands that his narration of the events is sometimes wrong.  (eg: The relationship between Jenny & her father)  But I just feel cheated when the narrator is lying.  It's stupid of me .. especially when in films like 'The Usual Suspects' when we know ahead of time that the narrator is a criminal.    But it doesn't fix my sense of betrayal.  A wiser man than I once pointed out something interesting in the way 'A Beautiful Mind' was structured.  It follows our hero closely .. until it is revealed that his visions of the world are entirely unreliable.    Once that's revealed to the audience, the story stops following him.  We no longer see things from his perspective.    Instead the story follows his wife coping with him ... someone who we can identify with.  Then it goes back to following our unreliable hero, but the audience is never deceived again.  I think the audience would have felt cheated if there had been further deceptions after the midpoint.  And the audience would have been confused if there hadn't been a clean break in the middle to re-affirm what is real .v. illusion.  So it's a challenge when the character we are meant to be identifying with is seeing the world in an 'unreliable' way .. it really gets in the way of us being able to connect with them.  But when it's done well ... it's magical.  -- Mac"

The audience didn't know whether Wilfred was real because Ryan didn't know.   That concept is good for a twist ending, like in The Sixth Sense, where we are experiencing the characters point of view. That character was unaware that they weren't telling the whole story.   It's really hard to pull off though. There is a reason people groan at the ""it was all a dream"" cliche."

That a great script will sell, that the money will change your life, that if you're great enough to do it once you can easily do it again, and that sales are the only way a writer earns. None of that is strictly true. The truth is more complicated, more nuanced. My life is boring, a lot of down time, a lot of writing, occasional moments of allllllmost scoring a big win, and then back to the drawing board.  When I was younger, I was desperate to make it. I wanted to be like Orson Welles, have a movie done by 25. I sold my first script at 23, but for a variety of reasons, my life wasn't an unbroken string of successes. I used to hate this, but now I'm happy for it. I had a lot to learn and all my setbacks, all my failures, all the mean things some redditors say are part of my story. The second act of my life that teaches me, informs my arc, and leads me to whatever the next act may bring.  I like writing. I like teaching.

Screenwriting,3dvjv6,Lookout3,2,Mon Jul 20 02:39:44 2015 UTC,The true art of an artist isn't in what they paint or write but the emotions they stir in the people that have experienced them.   Given that definition the artistry of your posts have.... well..... the results are here for everyone to see.
Screenwriting,3dvjv6,wrytagain,3,Mon Jul 20 02:48:55 2015 UTC,So by that logic a mugger is a better artist than you. Brilliant. Utterly brilliant.
Screenwriting,3dvjv6,poseymund,2,Sun Jul 19 22:47:37 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make sense. If you are holding a mugger to the same standards as an artist (which you claim yourself to be one, thus I hold you to those standards) then everyone is an artist no matter how moronic they act as long as they elicit some emotion from someone.   I don't have spell out what I meant do I.  You get it right.  I mean, you say people are less intelligent than you enough on this thread that I can safely hold you to at least THAT standard right? Fine.  Just in case here I go.   You claim to enough skill in the art of screenplay writing that you can teach it. Yet, when people challenge you a tantrum ensues. Screenwriting is all about communicating an idea. Thus, you seem to be communicating something that stirs people up and makes them not like you. If that is your intention, well done. If not, your accidentally great at it I guess. Trying to be positive.   Look, I have learned some cool things from you. I hope you keep posting stuff. I might not agree with everything but that's ok.   Don't be butt hurt when people challenge you. Take it honorably. I don't say that lightly because I get butt hurt sometimes too."

Look at the consequences of your ""extreme sarcasm.""    So by that logic a mugger is a better artist than you. Brilliant. Utterly brilliant.   Your sarcastically calling me brilliant. Thus, not that brilliant. Stupid maybe. That is judgmental. I am just pointing out what is obvious to everyone.   I am just a statistic now on this sub of the many people you have lashed out at because you didn't like what they had to say. I am just a number. And it seems a high one at that.   Calling people ""kid"" in a pejorative way, shaming people for what they do and how much money they make, calling people silly, ""First day on /r/screenwriting?""  Come on. You can admit it to me.

Screenwriting,3dvjv6,Lookout3,0,Mon Jul 20 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"I know these guys. The only person I've ever called a kid is /u/Lookout3. Why? Because he's younger than me, and early on in our relationship he assumed he was older, and used to preface every lecture with ""I used to think just like you,"" and he seemed to think he was older, even when I pointed out that an earlier post he made made that impossible. With Lookout3, I've despaired of logic and empathy. It's just emotionally easier to deal with him sarcastically. He's one of the rare few that can legitimately make me butt hurt, which will no doubt amuse and delight him.  With /u/Camshell, it's obviously not his first day on reddit because I talk to him every day.  I'm asking /u/DavidsBund how much money he makes not to shame him but to highlight the reason why him asking me about what I do is an awkward question for me to answer.  Here's why you're not a statistic: you're saying something really smart: if I want to communicate, why am I saying it in a way that would seem to preclude communication?

And how so much of this is done - or at least finalized - digitally.  For example, Photoshop can take a flat picture and wrap it around a 3D shape. Violá, instant perfect perspective. No meticulous draftsmanship required. Perhaps there is an equivalent to this that future writers will use to churn out 'perfect' examples of screenwriting (or any kind of writing). But of course, perspective is just one part of the puzzle, like structure is in screenwriting. I can arrange decorative cubes all day on my computer and no-one would want to look at them.  Technical perfection won't be a cure-all. There are so many other aspects to a 'good' picture and we just don't know if they can ever be reproduced algorithmically. There are certainly ongoing attempts, Google's Deep Dream being an interesting one."

Screenwriting,3dvjv6,KnightBates,3,Mon Jul 20 15:10:51 2015 UTC,"Basquiat   His father, Gerard Basquiat, was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and his mother, Matilde Basquiat, who was of Puerto Rican descent, was born in Brooklyn, New York. Matilde instilled a love for art in her young son by taking him to art museums in Manhattan and enrolling him as a junior member of the Brooklyn Museum of Art.[6][7] Basquiat was a precocious child who learned how to read and write by age four and was a gifted artist. His teachers, such as artist Jose Machado, noticed his artistic abilities, and his mother encouraged her son's artistic talent. By the age of 11, Basquiat could fluently speak, read and write French, Spanish and English.  In September 1968, when Basquiat was about 8, he was hit by a car while playing in the street. His arm was broken and he suffered several internal injuries, and he eventually underwent a splenectomy.[8] While he was recuperating from his injuries, his mother brought him the Gray's Anatomy book to keep him occupied. This book would prove to be influential in his future artistic outlook. His parents separated that year and he and his sisters were raised by their father.[6][9] The family resided in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, for five years, then moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1974. After two years, they returned to New York City.[10]  When he was 13, his mother was committed to a mental institution and thereafter spent time in and out of institutions.[11] At 15, Basquiat ran away from home.[6][12] He slept on park benches in Tompkins Square Park, and was arrested and returned to the care of his father within a week.[6][13]  Basquiat dropped out of Edward R. Murrow High School in the tenth grade and then attended City-As-School, an alternative high school in Manhattan home to many artistic students that have been failed by conventional schooling."

I've found that it's not just the lyrics but the repetition in popular/rock music that draws your mind away from the writing. You subconsciously, then consciously, start ""singing"" the hook or chorus in your head when you know it's coming. With most jazz it's ever changing motifs, so your mind stays on the page, but it also provides a nice unintrusive backdrop."

I've had periods where I spent 6+ hours writing a teleplay and didn't even notice the music until my playlist came to an end.  Another trick I like to do is start up some music I'm really familiar with.  Some Vangelis, Ennio Morricone, Tchaikovsky, Vivaldi, James Horner, John Barry, Koichi Sugiyama or Joe Hisaishi.  All some of my favorite composers.  But my mind seems to be tricked into not listening to the music, since I've heard it so many times before.  Which allows me to put nearly all my attention on the writing itself.  Can't vouch that this trick will work for you, especially if you start listening to their music for the first time."

I'm assuming the game is what if the world treated binge-watching like alcohol.  The premise is an AA type meeting for binge-watchers.  Binge Watcher's Anonymous is people learning to not binge watch, correct?   And Derek cares about spoilers because he hasn't been binging, right?  So why does Derek have a problem? Shouldn't they be applauding his restraint?  Right now you seem to have two awesome games.   What if binge-watching was treated like substance abuse. What if the head of an AA type meeting couldn't handle his urges during meetings.   The sketch would probably be stronger if you focused on one (I assume 1) then both.   SEAN  (ashamed)  Hi, I’m Sean, and I... I binged last night.   The group falls silent.   DEREK  What did you watch, Sean?   (softly)  Breaking Bad. (swallows hard) All five seasons.  SEAN  Derek smacks his forehead.   Is this also a universe where you can watch all five seasons of a show in one night? Or does he watch multiple episodes at once on different TVs?

Generally, when you have a single-protagonist movie, you'll notice that the break POV rarely, and for short periods of time that directly affect the main protagonist.   Your rationale for them makes me concerned. It's a pretty common beginner problem to feel the need to set everything up. We probably don't need to know why she behaves the way she does. This isn't her story. We just need to understand how she behaves.   I would err on the side of less breaking away from his POV, and if things are unclear once you've written the draft, you can always add material to clarify."

Most films have multiple point of view characters so it's odd you'd be getting a note to not have any point of view characters other than the protagonist. What the note may really mean is this character's subplot is for some reason not working for readers. There's a pretty good archive article on POV characters on Terry Rossio's Wordplay site at http://wordplayer.com that is definitely worth a read on this subject."

If it's just wide and general notes you don't have to address in a meeting, then you're golden, just find the core and run with it. Good luck."

Sure, characters like Dewey Crowe can come across as goofy because they're so stupid, but Justified actually spends a lot of time showing just how idiotic criminals can be. So unlike other shows that rely on characters doing unbelievably stupid things to advance the plot, the characteristic goofiness/stupidity of this show feels very well, um, justified.  Interestingly, Raylan himself is depicted as competent but not especially smart-- which makes sense, because he never had to be that smart to catch most of his idiot targets.    That said, Outlander is TERRIBLE. My god. I know it's more for women but it's ridiculous.   Out of curiosity, how many episodes of Outlander did you actually watch?  Because by the mid-season finale, Outlander was already really good.

I have the same situation going on in my script. The main character doesn't arc, however I am hoping that the audiences reaction to them does.  The character will hopefully elicit a variety of emotional responses in the reader/viewer take them on a veritable rollercoaster ride and in the end leave them possibly loathing the character but hopefully understanding and empathising with them.  Having the secondary character (in my case almost an antagonist but not entirely) arc is a by product of the audiences journey as such and not a sop to convention."

It was pretty intimidating to go to the Simpsons offices. They had a huge mural on the wall of all the Simpsons characters.  His office was filled with Simpsons memorabilia. He sat behind his huge desk and chatted for a bit.  Then he said, ""Why do you want this job? What do you want to do with your life?""  ""I want to be a writer and I think this job could help with that,"" I told him.  He looked at me and said, ""You want to be a writer? Then write."" And that was the end of the interview.  I was pretty discouraged after that because I thought being an assistant to a huge producer on one of the biggest tv shows of all time would be my in. But he was right. I hadn't even really written anything. Anything good at least.  And I wouldn't, for years.  When I finally did write something good, I didn't need to be an assistant to get my foot in the door. I used the blacklist and won a contest and went from there.  I guess the moral of the story is don't get too hung up on becoming an assistant. I know it would be nice to be in the industry and make contacts. But 99% of your energy should focused on writing something great.  ""You want to be a writer? Then write."""
Screenwriting,3duc2l,slupo,4,Sun Jul 19 17:39:02 2015 UTC,"At the same time, I kind of hate this answer he gave in those specific circumstances. You can write AND have a job where you can learn about the process/make contacts. There's little nobility to working a dead end job, writing nights and wagering your entire future on hitting it big with a script that lifts you out of the dredges. I know people who go insane doing that, and your scripts don't necessarily get better writing in a vacuum versus working with other professionals and watching them do their craft.  What would the correct answer to that question have been? ""I wanna be an assistant?"" Yeesh. Or "" I wanna be like you, Mr. Producer?"" Okay, sure. But everybody's got dreams.

So it didn't happen fast for me either.  In terms of advice... like any other business, advertising (if that's what you're going in to but it applies to anything else) is built on relationships. As you progress in your career, just try to meet as many people as possible. They will go to other agencies and if you made a good impression on them, they can be a valuable contact when you're looking for work. Advertising is a surprisingly small world.  How to make a good impression: just be friendly and easy to work with. Don't be difficult about making changes (you will make MANY changes you don't agree with). You'd be surprised how far that being someone people like to work with will take you. I would gladly take a less skilled person over a more skilled one if the less skilled one is fun to work with. You hire your friends. That's just how it is.  And the most obvious: work hard. Do your job well and in a timely manner. Again, someone who is dependable and can crank out work is better than the creative genius who is a total flake.  Actually, the above advice applies to screenwriting too! Good luck!"

Screenwriting,3duc2l,xpoz,4,Sun Jul 19 20:00:56 2015 UTC,"It's hard because a lot of people want entry level jobs in the entertainment business and producers/executives don't want to hire unvetted strangers. I would say 50%+ of the assistant jobs are filled by people coming out of agencies. That's the best place to start. Push a mail cart, work for a covering agent, then go assist a producer.   As far as the job goes, yes it is scheduling and phones, but you also read a ton, do notes on scripts and cuts, delegate to interns, network with other assistants. It's a fun job that pays no money and if you're lucky you'll have enough time to write in the side."
Screenwriting,3duc2l,paulmetzler,5,Sun Jul 19 17:04:50 2015 UTC,"Do you know about the marshmallow test? It was an experiment they did a couple decades ago, where they asked little kids to not eat a marshmallow for five minutes, with the promise that they would get to eat three marshmallows if they held out. Kids who successfully did not eat the marshmallow were later shown to have higher grades, test scores, get into better schools, etc. Different psychologists have referenced the test in various self-help books, to talk about the value of grit, or will power. Essentially, it showed that the ability to defer gratification, even for small periods of time, was invaluable in pursuing larger goals.   The entertainment industry is one long marshmallow test. Yes, we all want to eat all the marshmallows, right now. We want cool jobs, big paychecks, awards, fame, and we all want it yesterday. But we can't have the marshmallows right now, so instead, we defer gratification, and we do the hard work of getting a little closer to those goals every day. Eventually, we learn the same thing those researchers did -- delaying gratification makes us better at the stuff we're trying to do.   -- Taking another pass at a script will make the finished product better, even thought it is so, so tempting to just go ahead and submit it and be done -- Going to bed and getting 8 hours of sleep makes us sharper and more productive on set the next day, even though it would be fun to stay out with friends  -- Reading a submited script at lunch instead of surfing the internet means we have more time to mull our reaction, so we can write better coverage for our boss  And so on. In fact, the secret to delaying gratification is to put all your attention on getting good at the delay so you forget all about the gratification. (The kids in the test often covered their eyes and sang little songs to themselves. I don't recommend that in the work place, but hey, whatever works.)   So the reason those jobs are so hard to get isn't that the actual tasks are so impossible. They're not brain surgery. But they do require someone who is going to delay gratification and do the hard work that looks nothing like a fricking marshmallow. Yes, of course you want to be a writer. (Or producer, or director, or...) Yes, of course certain jobs will help with that. But someone who knows how to delay gratification will say (as I did in virtually every single interview and cover letter): I'm very much an aspiring TV writer, but I have so much to learn that I'm just focused on paying my dues and supporting working writers anyway I can. I've set up four writers' offices, I believe in keeping the coffee fresh and the fridge stocked, and I can dejam any copier ever made. I have the customer support numbers for Final Draft and Movie Magic on speed dial on my phone and I know where to find the best bagels in Los Angeles.   (All of which is true, btw.)   Inability to delay gratification will kill you in the interview phase. Hell, it'll kill you in the resume-submitting phase. I can't bring resumes to my boss with an objective that reads: Aspiring TV writer with fantastic storytelling ability and strong plotting instincts seeks internship or assistant role.   Look, deep in our hearts? That's all of our objectives. We know that's who we are. But we also know that we're not ready and blurting out our fondest dreams in interviews or resumes or right-in-the-middle-of-the-day-asking-for-a-freelance-script-because-a-writer-just-got-fired... well, it looks impulsive, self-serving and super unprofessional. And NOBODY wants to hire someone impulsive, self-serving and super unprofessional. If you're honest with yourself, you know YOU wouldn't want some like that working for you. Changing the oil on your car? Walking your dog? Cooking your lunch? No, we'd all prefer someone careful, patient and knowledgeable did those things.   And if you want an assistant job, that's who you have to be. BE. Not fake like you are, not pretend, not suck-it-up-until-you-get-staffed... BE.   Btw, I get that this sucks. We're all people. We all have wants and dreams and fears, and I'm telling you that none of that matters when you're going after an assistant job. At best, it feels deeply unfair. At worst, it's a fucking nightmare. I just recently talked to an assistant who took a job, telling himself that it wasn't ideal, but it would definitely lead to a writing job, so he sucked it up. (His words.) Season ended, show staffed up, and he was invited to come back for S4 at the same level, i.e., not as a writer. A year of him telling himself every day that he was just doing this to get the writing job left him so mentally warped that now he's almost out of his mind with rage and thwarted entitlement and resentment towards the staffed writers. He's hoping to get a freelance this season and turn that into a staff writing gig, but if he starts blurting to near-strangers about how unfair his life is and how hard he's worked and how no one gives a chance TEN MINUTES into a conversation?  Well, chances are his poker face at work is total shit.   Don't be this person. Don't go after assistant jobs because you think they're lottery tickets that will ultimately pay off. Because if that kind of thinking gets in your head, and you have one too many setbacks, and you end up like this guy? Honestly, you'll just do your career more damage."
Screenwriting,3duc2l,k8powers,2,Sun Jul 19 20:59:46 2015 UTC,"Lots of good answers in this thread so far. Interning is the way to do it. It's rare for someone to get in otherwise, but it happens.  The job isn't so much about the mundane tasks you have to do, it's about access. You get to see behind the curtain and when the time is right you can slip your script to someone who could actually make something happen for you, whether it's just getting reps or getting it produced. You are much better off as a writer in the business of you get how the business works and know people. That said, it's a trade off because most assistant jobs don't leave much time for writing. You have to pay the bills somehow, the choice you have to make is if you want to be on the inside and kill yourself to write your scripts or if you want to write your ass off as a barista and kill yourself to get noticed."

Screenwriting,3duc2l,AudibleExhale,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:47:27 2015 UTC,"Why is it so hard to get an assistant position at a studio or production company? - There are more people that want these jobs then there are positions available. Also these jobs are seldom posted. You won't see a sign in the window that says Help Wanted and you walk right in with a resume  The assistant positions list a bunch of skills, but you actually need them to answer phones and order food for everyone? - Correct. It seems unfair when likely you just spent a bunch of money on a bachelor's degree. The thing is, again, these are highly desirable positions and anyone who is looking for an assistant has the luxury of picking from a giant talent pool in most cases. They can pick someone that is highly skill even though they will most likely pick up food and answer phones.  How do you get in? Know someone. This task is harder for some more than others. Rely on family friends, college alumni's, classmates, improv buddies, random guy from party work every angle. Be proactive and creative in how you meet people. Build genuine relationships. Be honest, be motivated, and work hard.  And what do you actually do? You work a job. It's fun that you're making TV but you will make copies and coffee. It's a job. You work your way up the ladder by putting in the time. Keep writing because that's half the battle. And don't waste your opportunity to learn and grow as a writer in the position. Ask questions and build lasting relationships with peers, your bosses, and the writers if you can."
Screenwriting,3duuwe,YoBFF,2,Sun Jul 19 18:23:31 2015 UTC,"As a writer I find structure comforting and keeps me on track with my outline  other wise my act two spirals into the pits of hell causing depression and rage at my innocent laptop.  As a reader I find a script with great structure has better momentum, stakes seem to be clearer, and I find turning the pages easier. Structure sets up screenwriters for a successful narrative that is intended for the screen with an imbedded audience. Scenes crashing into one another like dominoes, entering a scene late and leaving it early, leaving the reader wanting more in an organic way not just because the story is muddy and frustrating and probably resting on a shitty reveal we will never get to because we can't read through 100 pages of boring material."
Screenwriting,3duuwe,vonnegutgal,2,Sun Jul 19 20:16:44 2015 UTC,I like that response. It reminds me of the different between good layout and bad layout in comics. Bad layout is confusing unless you literally draw arrows over the panels. Good layout draws the eye to go exactly where you want it in the exact right order without having to spell it out.
Screenwriting,3duuwe,cynicallad,3,Mon Jul 20 00:37:00 2015 UTC,"I actually wrote one of my senior papers on this. Structure in screenwriting (and all writing) is like the four chord song  There's no arguing that the structure works. Of course, to make a song that is actually quality, you need to combine that structure with real talent. With music, your instruments, vocals, lyrics, and energy and such have to be up to snuff if you want your song to be memorable. With screenwriting, your characters, dialogue, prose, and action and such have to be solid enough to keep readers interested and engaged. So structure is a stepping stone on the way to a great script/story.  It works for the same reason that the four chord structure works for music: it works on a very basic level, and because of that, humanity as a whole has accepted it as the natural design of a story. It's the type of story we're most ""comfortable"" with, to put it another way. That doesn't mean it's the only type of story we like or appreciate.  Just like many (MANY) songs do not follow the four-chord structure (which, by the way, has some very interesting parallels to the three-act structure), there are plenty of fantastic stories that bend or stray entirely from the typical narrative structures. This is why it's important to learn and understand the structures beyond the elementary ""inciting incident on page 15, protagonist's lowest point at page 75, etc."" level. You'll end up with a predictably-paced and predictably-plotted story.  But if you really break down the structures and analyze how and why they work, you'll end up with a better appreciation for storytelling. And that's when the magic happens. You learn to sculpt the structure to suit your story. Instead of tailoring your idea so that it fits some predetermined mold, you improvise. You write it the way that it works, and then you rewrite it until you've got callouses on your fingertips. In the end, it'll probably resemble the structures we all know and love. Because they work and after studying them endlessly, they're practically part of your subconscious. But instead of worrying about the exact proper placement of your second act turning point, you're just worried about writing a damn good script. Even if it means breaking the ""rules.""  The Beatles and Led Zeppelin have plenty of four chord songs. Hey Jude and Stairway to Heaven are not four chord songs. But they never could've written those songs without working their way through the basics. They learned the four chords and the major/minor scales, then they learned them backwards, inside-out, and upside-down. They stopped working for the structure and made it work for them.  So learn your scales and practice them until you've got blisters on your fingers."
Screenwriting,3duuwe,er1339,4,Mon Jul 20 08:03:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with your friend that treating storytelling like a science is a problematic strategy. One of the fundamental differences between art and not art is that art has to be new. You can sleep in the same bed every night or use the same detergent for every load of laundry, but you don't want to watch the same movie over and over every day, no matter how good it is. There can be no best movie that everyone always watches all the time. And because of that, there can be no best way to write a movie. The best way to write a movie would result in the best movie, which can't exist. The newness is fundamental. It's an essential part of the product.   And the guidelines are all about what has come before. They're all about what is not new. By necessity. So even if the guidelines are useful in some way, they ignore a very big part of storytelling. A part of storytelling that I think has been downplayed to death to the point where it's not really even really acknowledged anymore. Probably because its very inconvenient. If screenwriting is about inventing something new, who is going to tell me how to do that?"

In the above 'script' my opinion is voiced by 'friend' and everything I've been told I channeled through 'me' (I did this because previous attempts at a discussion like this in which I questioned the methods were a disaster and not helpful).    I wouldn't consider myself a screenwriter -- I only write scripts I intend to make myself (all shorts so far). But I have a problem. My growth as a film artist has plateaued and I think my writing is the problem.    So: I didn't used to abide by screenwriting standards, I hit a plateau, so now I'm questioning whether or not I should start paying attention to all of the things my professors, books, and people on this sub say -- but I won't do it blindly, I'm looking for peoples' reasons for following these standards.    Or better yet, the underlying reason for why they exist in the first place."

The problem is, you think they are standards. You have a cart/horse issue. A story has a beginning, middle and end. Because we live in time/space and unless you want to present random, unconnected images, you have a beginning (Jack and Jill are going up a hill, they have a goal - getting water) middle (Jack fell down and broke his crown - oh crap - will Jill save the day and get the water?) and end (and Jill came tumbling after).  It's a tragedy in three acts.   If you go back to Syd Field, what he talks about is recognizing something inherent in cinematic story-telling. He talks about more than structure, too. He talks about telling the story in pictures. The structure is essentially imposed. Two hours. To be viewed and understood by human beings. We have a limited capacity for processing information over a set time.  The books aren't telling you something the authors made up, they are telling you what people who paid attention discovered.  And they all say basically the same thing.  IF you don't get to the damned point until page 60, you'll lose your audience. ""I kept waiting for the story to start."" is a very common complaint. That about the capacity of a human to process information.  Fall too far behind them, you bore the shit out of them. Thirty minutes in, they need to be familiar with the world and the expectations of genre and have a clue what the stakes are and the struggle/challenge is.  It's just the way it works. Then people make diagrams about it.  No one is telling you what to do.  They are telling you the way things work."

What the movies that succeed, that you like, have in common.   If you Google, you'll find the screenplay for The Fifth Estate online at Wikileaks. Read it. It was a no-brainer the movie would  bomb.

That confession makes way more sense.  My confession: I love and hate structure. I love it, because it gives us all something to talk about and it helps me share something with beginners who are coming in blind. I hate it because it's so fucking controversial, and even mentioning the words ""inciting incident"" get me accused of being a Blake Snyder dick rider.  I basically accept structure, but not uncritically. I used to hate Blake Snyder, but not uncritically. The older I get, the more I roughly sense what he was trying to say, even if I don't care for the way he said it.  I think structures like the hero's journey are a crude attempt by bygone wise men to offer a simple map to a complicated system. I see the map less as a platonic ideal for the formula of story, and more as a map of us, of people. Who we are, how we see things, what it takes to convince us with a story.

What I need: you mentioned a name, Blake Snyder, that's a start. I'm looking for material on screenplay structure (preferably with treatment on why anyone would use that structure), which I can study and try out for myself to see if it helps with my problem.    Specifically: I think my problem is with 'breathing room' and dialogue (and breathing room in dialogue). In my last two shorts, if you're not paying I-just-chugged-a-red-bull attention to every frame, there's no way you'll know what's going on. I do that sort of on purpose (the degree to which it happens isn't on purpose) so that I'm not having the characters state their motives and feelings. I also need to figure out how to write-in material which translates to 'interstitial' shots to give the 'meaningful' shots room to breathe, without looking like filler (I have a theory that I'd love to write little, eighth-of-a-page, contextual shorts to help with the breathing -- but writing something that short would HAVE to be heavily structured, which I'm trying to learn about)."

The missing element of your game might be structure, but between this and your opening scene, I'm perceiving an empathy gap. You're having trouble writing your friend in a way that doesn't make him look flawed (notice that I picked up on the argument from authority problem immediately). With your films you're not sure exactly how much breathing room the audience needs because your sense of how they work and what they need is a little off.  Empathy is important. If you have empathy, you can write a rounded meditation on faith like DOUBT. If you don't, that same piece reads like glurge - http://www.snopes.com/religion/chalk.asp   You can read Snyder if you want, by my imaginative empathy tells me you won't like him and you'll resent me for mentioning his name.

It was a bit of a surprise because I entered this same script into the Script Pipeline and Page International competitions and did not make it into the quarterfinals in those, yet I'm in the quarters in the Nicholl's. It seems like it all depends on who the judges you get are.  Last year too I got top 15 percent in the Nicholl's on a comedy script. The Nicholl's judge said '""This script had me laughing out loud from the first scene's clever opening gag. The jokes are plentiful and well-timed, and the dialogue is, sharp and quotable. It’s got a goofy, oddball, self-referential style of humor, reminiscent of ""The Three Amigos"" or ""Shaun of the Dead. The writer is definitely talented and funny, with an eye for comedic timing.""     When I entered that same script into the BlueCat competition, the judge was horribly offended for some reason by the jokes, and gave a terrible review.   Sometimes these competitions don't make sense."
Screenwriting,3dtpy5,oddsoulpics,2,Sun Jul 19 18:15:48 2015 UTC,Hahaha! Yep! Those two conflicting opinions had me laughing out loud! These competition don't make sense most of the time but I think they're a necessary evil.  The best way to get your script sold and produced is getting representation but to get an agent you need some sort of a track record and the only way for most of us writers to get any attention from agencies is to play the screenwriting contest lottery.
Screenwriting,3dtpy5,oddsoulpics,2,Sun Jul 19 18:29:59 2015 UTC,"My script that is still in the running in the Nicholl, I shared it with a few people on here (or readmyscript). I did some revision after that, but no real major changes.   One of the redditors that gave me really negative feedback, here are some highlights:  ""I don't know why you chose not to write a story, and to instead write something like this.""  ""the most fatal flaw here: there aren't any characters""  ""It reads like a spoof of a spoof with nothing to spoof, but once again, it just wasn't funny.""  ""I found myself going ""What? Really? Okay..."" Which is never good.""  ""you resort to cliched characters and hollywood, skim-the-surface type relationships the whole script. I think you could write a great script, but not a comedy like this. It's just not funny and there's no depth to offset that.""  Point being, readers can get drastically different experiences from the same script. I think a lot of it comes from the reader projecting something into the script. If you trade scrips with someone on reddit, maybe you expect that guy to not be talented and so you don't give them the benefit of the doubt and don't really get into a script.   When I was in a college writing workshop class, I had a teacher do an exercise where we did a practice workshop before we started workshopping each others stories. He gave us a short story that was submitted the previous semester, we read it as homework, then came to class to discuss it. We ripped it to shreds, nobody liked it, all kinds of shitty remarks.   Then he revealed that it was actually an award winning short story by Hemingway (or somebody famous). Point being, if you are reading something in a lit class, you give the author the benefit of the doubt and spend time interpreting what they meant. IF you think the author is an amateur, rather than thinking ""what did this mean?"" you jump to ""I don't get it, therefore it's stupid.""  Didn't make a huge difference still, workshop classes are usually brutal on everyone. Everyone's a critic."

The only real comfort was that I was told that two of the scripts I entered got positive scores from a reader, it's just that the scores weren't high enough to warrant a third reader that could've placed me higher. That's an improvement over last year where the script I submitted apparently wasn't liked by anyone there.   A funny thing is that the script that I think is the best or at least, the one that people were more likely to like has been the most ignored in the contests and festivals I've submitted into.

So it can indeed happen that some people may like your script while others may not like it at all. I guess this is where the advantage of living in LA comes in where if you can find just one person in some sort of position of power who likes your script it can make it so much easier to have it produced.

One written without taking any advice from any of these books.  2) Each script needs to be written from the same premise — a different premise will add another variable making it more difficult to determine if each book's ""magic structure theory"" is working.  3) Each script will need to be written without knowledge of the advice from the books read prior. If you do this exercise with ""Save the Cat"" first, all subsequent scripts will be viewed as products of the ""Save the Cat"" magic by the Snyderians. Followers of the other gurus will draw similar conclusions as you progress through their chosen books.  4) Until one script sells and is produced, there will be no hard evidence as to the legitimacy of your conclusions."

Screenwriting,3dse9d,FightingBobEvans,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:32:51 2015 UTC,"That could be accurate, never visualized it before so its interesting looking at it. Ya the fights are the scenes, the ideas themselves are the characters. Now they don't have to be actual ""fights"", the protagonist and antagonist stand on opposite ends but both exchange ideas to one another hoping they can convince the other of coming to their side. The narrower the differences between them the better.   You mention survive in life, thats a good subject. Ideas i think are tempered by emotions so in a sense we can call them values here instead. If its death they fear, then the angle would be how they planned on making the most out of their limited life. Its usually brought on by abandonment issues. Their actions could be careless or hurtful even when they intend on doing good; that's why survival is morally challenging. Basically one can't have their cake and eat it too, but often that's what characters are trying to do and they fail. Sounds too general I know but i like to keep it broad.  Movies by themselves are so much more simple actually, its just a montage of a series of events at the end of the day. It might be best to do what feels right at first then find ways to make it better by seeing what works well in movies."

Let the audience think they’re one step ahead of you. And right about when they can fully articulate the question -- WHAM! You have one of the characters articulate the exact question. Someone else gives the explanation as an offhand remark (duh, because X, Y, Z, stupid).  All at once you let the audience know they’re in good hands with you as the writer and it buys you goodwill for any other apparent plot holes."

The point of the rules is to prevent the human travellers from bringing an AK-47, a calulator, a book on Confucius, or anything like that.   Here's another way to approach it.  Make the box a highly advanced AI, indistinguishable from a supernatural spirit.  It's called the Gatekeeper.  It's purpose is to allow clothed humans to pass on a journey of peace and non-interference.  Anything the Gatekeeper doesn't recognize, understand or trust with peaceful and non-interfering intent, it just won't transfer from here to there.  This idea can be communicated in an oblique inscription which only makes sense after they journey to there.  It could also be articulated by giving the Gatekeeper a voice and a personality.  If the Gatekeeper has a personality, it can also react to what the hero is doing.  It can stop working if he starts trying experiments, because it recognizes his intent.  It can threaten to stop working for him, if he does not use it as intended.  By giving the box a mind and persona, you remove the dictation of strict rules that could be gamed or dissected.  Use this if you like it, ignore it if you don't, it's a gift with no strings attached."

You and Arthur Clarke.   any ideas as to why giving the magic/tech a ""personality"" or intent allows you more wiggle room?   Sure.    If you have a gadget constrained by explicit rules, they can be gamed. Also, the audience will doubtless figure out some obscure unintended consequence of your rules.  If the gadget has a personality that constrains its behavior, the audience can't game the rules, because the rules aren't clear.  Also, any unintended consequence can be circumvented by the peronality's unwillingness to help in the result.  It's in the personality's interest to not articulate the rules.  The more explicitly the rules are articulated, the more likely they are to be gamed.  In addition, a personality may be empowered to adjust the rules to protect the guiding goals.  The gadget may be constrained by heuristics rather than rigid rules.  If the Gateway's personality was directed to ""do no harm to this world, but bring no harm to the other"" the personality could make many judgements about who and what gets to make the journey and in what condition.    The personality makes the gadget a character the hero has to struggle with, rather than a puzzle to be solved.  Hope that helps."
Screenwriting,3dse9d,wrytagain,2,Sun Jul 19 06:01:01 2015 UTC,"On a related point, it's easier to work with rules in narrative if they take the form of directives.  ""Keep them out of the light. Never get them wet.  Never feed them after midnight.""  How do you game that?  You can't. If you break the rules, you get the consequences.  The Terminator time machine rules, you can game or you can nitpick.  So perhaps instead of making up all the logical rules of how your portal operates, you should just carve on the interior walls some things that are forbidden.  No weapons.  No tech.  Whatever.  How you enforce that in the story is up to you.  Does the character who hides a knife just lose the knife, or also the ankle it was strapped to?  Does sneaking a camera in get you struck dead?  You get what you want for the story, and the rules can't be gamed."

The rules are there to facilitate transfer of information -- it's a standard; if everyone learns to use the standard, then information is more easily transferred. What I'm saying is that grammar and spelling errors will at most bring you out of the story.

To radically simplify my favorite chapters from ""Thinking Fast and Slow,"" when the brain picks up on a lot of little wrong things, it gets stressed out. It senses danger, and it starts to conserve energy. A stressed out brain isn't open to new ideas. It's not flexible. It's cautious. It wants to stick with what's safe and established. You don't want your reader actively looking for reasons to not like your script, to discard it as not good, just because typos and spelling errors made the reader's brain stressed out and overly cautious.   Related side note: It's dangerous to put your trust in someone who doesn't know what they don't know. Making movies and TV shows costs huge sums of money.

I don't want to speak out against the all holy Game of Thrones, but that show does this all the time honestly.  I can see almost every plot point coming a mile away because its trying to go out of its way to subvert my expectation.  -A huge 6' 5"" tall knight is beating down a host of other knights in a competition.  Camera pans back as the knight takes of helmet...  And in my mind, what's the first thing I think of?  It's probably a woman.  Because, due to past experience with watching this show, they seem to always try and do the opposite of what the general audience would expect.  And sure enough, in season 2, this exact scenario happens.  Anyway, not exactly on topic, but I've been watching a lot of Game of Thrones recently and it just hits one of my annoyances.  Subverting the viewers expectation can be the best surprise in a show.  But do it too often, and your audience will be less impressed each time.  Especially when it comes to character deaths, which is another major issue with Game of Thrones.  So many characters dying left and right, you start to care less about their point in the plot and more about wondering when they will die."

Like if you show a shot of an alarm clock in the evening, I'd never guess you were subverting the cliche of a young man waking up and turning off his alarm clock.   It's all about what surprising the audience with plays on expectations. Ie, in a horror movie it's cliched for a group to split off, we know people will die, and it's annoyingly cliched. But if the group wants to split off and one character says it's a bad idea but is killed immediately while still in the group, then the expectation is subverted."

Many of the examples of subverting a cliche or trope is taking the assumption and giving it a new reality.   Showing a clock and then panning out to show the house is gone, blown up but the clock is ok. That would be changing the context.  Let's say you started a scene this way. You have now anchored that surprise of the house being gone in the audience. Later you can do the same thing but this time have the house be fine and a hand will turn the clock off. All done within one story.   Anchoring emotions to scenes, situations is a very powerful technique. Leverage the cliche in the beginning but make it mean something else in your story.

Screenwriting,3dpk1m,Cosbyology,3,Sat Jul 18 05:28:02 2015 UTC,"That story was done quite well in Leon Ford's film 'Griff the Invisible'.  Heard of it?  Probably not - it was an Aussie indie film.  It had all the flaws that Aussie indie films are prone to ... but it handled the 'superhero' part really well.  It introduced the hero as straight forward as possible - as a superhero with an awesome batcave-like lair, an impressive superhero costume etc.  He battles bad guys every night with awesome martial art skills - and always wins.  One part that will always stay with me is the moment where he realises that he doesn't have superpowers - that he's just a guy with a problem accepting reality.   It's a great continuous shot (no SFX - only practical effects)  where as he looks around his amazing super-hero lair it transforms into reality - just a filthy garage full of worthless junk.  It's a truly heartbreaking scene.  It won the AACTA award that year for Best Original Screenplay.  Look it up.  If you think 'Walter Mitty blended with KickAss' you've got the right idea.  -- Mac Trailer for the film:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Z_AdqeDeo"

Both exercises are valid, a badly written movie if shown to a person of people will get you some notes which you can use to improve as a writer, as will a well written one.  The reason I feel it could be a bad idea is, if all you do is watch the movies similar to the ones suggested here, write a script and bring nothing  new to the table then you have wasted your time.  However if you watch those movies and ask yourself, what did they miss?  What can I see that no one else does?

I've been an aspiring writer for, near enough makes no difference, four years. I've had some small victories here and there. Some really strong reviews/ratings on the Black List 7s/8s/9s. One script generated some professional interest for a bit, which was nice. I mainly focus on feature writing and have dabbled in half-hour animation. As for reading? I've only read professional scripts in various stages of development and production. My intentions are to hopefully have a positive impact on the quality of work generated by this community. I see this as being mutually beneficial. I might get to read something great, and someone may be able to benefit from my perspective as a reader. My hope is that we can all grow as writers from the experience.  As for the cost, there isn't one. I'll not charge anyone a dime for this."

You can do it if it's really important to the story, but if it's just because you'd like a line to be said in a specific kind of way, you shouldn't write it down.   The actor is going to breath life into their characters, and they're better than you at delivering lines, so let them do their job.   Another thing is, that if you do this often, people are going to get annoyed and ignore it. So if you do it a lot, it won't have the effect you want anyway."

In that case, I'm writing a character trait.

I can safely tell you that you should not include any of that unless it is necessary to your plot (see Hitchcock). If actors are not allowed to act and perform with free range within the scene, or have no room for growth, they will feel like a robot and hate everyone.  Also, if you're not directing it, the director will rewrite your script and remove all that shit, anyway."
Screenwriting,3dpvm5,takeheed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:47:52 2015 UTC,"It depends what you mean when you say ""directing."" Parenthetical or scene direction? And also, just how much and what kind of directing is going on here.  Parentheticals are exhausting and if too much action is shoe horned into dialogue, it seriously slows down a read. If you've got more than one parenthetical every five pages that's probably too many parentheticals and less is more. I've written scripts that had one parenthetical in them and only then because the producers said the suits wouldn't know that line was sarcasm without a parenthetical.  [Parentheticals are not always for the actors, sometimes they are for the suits.]  If it's scene direction, if there's a character who talks with his or her hands a lot? That's something to put in scene direction introducing the character, and from time to time as a reminder in scene action. It's a character trait. It can say volumes about the character.  If the action is ""looking""? That's not real action. That is eyes moving around in a head. Scripts that habitually talk about where characters are looking are generally really action light because that's all they talk about. Deep looks here, there, at each other, away from each other. That's not direction. That's an over emphasis on non-action because the script itself doesn't contain enough real action and the writer is trying to give weak dialogue more emphasis by putting an emphasis on pauses, silences, and non-action.  Cut the looks. Concentrate on real action. Go really easy on parentheticals. Trust your actors. Once in a while give a hint to the suits who aren't real good at following emotional content."

Set in an alternate history where the Axis won World War II. The pilot was great, hopefully the rest of the series lives up to it.   And from the last few years, we've got: Watchmen, Iron Sky, Olympus Has Fallen, Inglorious Basterds, and so on. All of which play loose with history and facts. And there's absolutely no reason not to go the other way, and write about the future.   So, write whatever you want. No one will immediately dismiss it just because it features a war that hasn't yet happened.

The guy finally gets up, goes and brushes his teeth. He checks into a bedroom which is empty, but clearly a teenage girl's. He goes downstairs and as we follow him through the house we see he's got a home office. He spots his daughter on the patio with breakfast waiting. He goes out and pours some orange juice, takes a drink and makes a ""yuck"" face/sound, prompting the girl to smirk, ""Brushed your teeth first again?""

Just how important is the fact that your protag is a late riser to the actual plot?  This is such a competitive field, and having your script open with one of the most generic scenes in film is only adding another obstacle for yourself. The rest of the screenplay could be amazingly interesting and unique. But by having the ""groggy guy hitting snooze button"" thing front and center, you actually are holding yourself back, whether you believe you are or not.   This ""rule"" is not a rule at all. It's not something being imposed on you because other people want to boss you around. In reality, it's a helpful bit of advice.

I saw it done just last night, and it was funny how it stuck right out at me like it was lit up in pink neon. I was watching Run All Night and Liam Neeson's character and Ed Harris' character were sitting down talking, and Harris' character says (indicating decades earlier when they were teenagers), ""You remember the time when you and me and [some random girl's name] and [another random girl's name] were in here, and you had [random girl] on that bed and I had [other random girl] on this bed, and blah blah blah...""  And it was all obviously because the writer needed to establish that they had been good old pals for a very long time, since in a few minutes Neeson's character will be forced to shoot and kill Harris' character's son because he (Harris' character's son) was drawing down on his (Neeson's) son, and this will shatter their long term friendship and make them into enemies.  Maybe the reason this one annoys me is because in real life, if you wanted to make a point to an old friend that you were conscious and respectful of how long you'd both been friends, I think that rather than suddenly telling a story from way way back, you'd just say something like ""so how long have we been friends now... 34, 35 years?""  I don't know, it wasn't too bad... it was professionally written, but it just stuck out at me and seemed awkward. I think it's probably because I'm starting to really be able to tune into the dialogue in films and see into the writer's intent/technique in real time."

Then we go to the crime scene where Beckett arrives with a couple of UNIs, checks out the victim's body.  And then we go back to ROOFTOP PUBLISHING PARTY, where the two threads intersect and Beckett arrives to take Castle in for questioning.

Make it smart, make it interesting, and make it count, so the reader doesn't feel like things are slowing down, so the reader feels like things are expanding and interesting and revelatory, not just unending explaiontions, and it'll work.

Screenwriting,3dldj7,churrroboy,3,Sat Jul 18 05:26:59 2015 UTC,"Something that will be relevant in LA for your future writing career, maybe that you're hired to write a story that takes place in LA, or you want to write a story that takes place in LA, in an urban neighborhood, a gang story in Compton maybe, a crime or thriller story in Venice Beach, or the opposite end of the Spectrum you want to write about the upper class people in Laguna Beach or Beverly Hills. So maybe you should dive into LA to try to understand it and the people. Though you're here only a few days. Try to come back and stay at least a month each time. Visiting tourist spots or theme parks won't help, ditch the museums and top rated yelp bars, it'll be better to mold your own vision of LA with your own well rounded experiences. So here are a few things that will help you understand LA and it's people in case you need to write a cliche free LA screenplay.    I just discovered the app MeetUp, get it, you can meet with other writers, or just do random actitivies with other people, hiking, palleboarding, meetups about anything really,  Visit poor places Visit rich places Avoid tourist places, (you can go for kicks, it's like the same as going to a trendy bar, or theme park, sure it's fun, but will that make you a better writer? Not really. Try to see/experience things other writers don't. Don't assume things about LA or people, really dig into the culture(s), and maybe that will show in your writing to help you stay away from cliche's.) If you're writing a story about a rock band, about a urban gang, about an artist, a lawyer, then, come to LA and try to dive into things that person would be into. What would a mid 20's rock star be doing, what would a 40's lawyer be doing on his free time, he'll be using yelp then, yes. Would a 50 year old immigrant be using yelp, no. So just try to put yourself in your characters shoes. Movies are not your reference, that can invite cliches, make your own references with your own experiences.    It's like filming on location or on a green screen, what would you rather do? So better to get dirty, even get sick off the food if you have to, that will make you a better writer than googling shit about a city.  It's those little hidden, self discovered places that YOU FIND, THAT YOU LOVE, those little moments, that make LA great, not the food trucks with the biggest line of curly mustache dudes willing to spend $13 on a small ""fusion"" burger. But hey if your character is a hipster, then stand in line for an hour for a $13 burger. It's those mom and pop spots where you can't understand the owner of the place and he's a real asshole yet he gives you extra fortune cookies.  You have to go to ChinaTown, pick a random spot full of old Chinese people, and eat there. (That's actually a dare, but if you want to write a Chinese martial arts film some day, maybe some little thing will stick out to you, maybe the cook twists the head off the duck right at your table.)  Day 1. Turn your phone off, use it only for Uber, don't walk around with headphones or sun glasses on, don't Yelp shit, you want experiences don't you?   So from your location in Hollywood, Walk to the nearest metro station, or Uber it, get on the Metro (the underground metro), and just go, take your camera, or camera phone, and sit near a window. Find your way to Union Station exit, and get off, ask people for Olvera Street. Have some mexican food and margaritas there. Uber it after that to Skid Row, walk through the damn thing, if you have a go pro, wear it on your head the whole time, if you have $120, get one off someone on Craigslist. Uber it to Santa Monica pier, yeah it's a tourist spot but full of surprises as well. Walk over to 3rd street promenade from there.  Roscoes chicken n' Waffles in Long Beach, not the LA ones, you can Metro it there too.   Go to Tijuana for a day. It's a 2 hour drive to get there. Actually go to Rosarito (30 minutes past TJ), it's nice there. (Don't wear anything expensive if going.)  Getty Center Museum is cool, check out the botanic garden.   And I'm too lazy to write any more, I'm not proofreading nor thinking too heavily about this, take it with a grain of salt if you want. The bottom line is, LA has any experience you want. So what do you want? You want to experience it as a writer? Then I'm sure you know how to do that just fine. But if you want to experience it as a possible character for one of your stories, then experience it as such. Look from the inside out, don't look at your characters or LA from a writer's perspective looking through a glass, break the glass, and step inside, just try not to cut yourself. And have fun.  Oh wait, I just read you're a wanna be writer, well, then do wanna be writer things, yelp those trendy places, talk about your ideas, take your laptop to the beach and write as the sun sets. Nah don't do that, stop calling yourself a wanna be writer. Just be a writer, dig into your subject matter, be a damn sponge. It'll help you out when you go back to your desk.  -Peace"

I am a fiend for maps, so I'll study maps like crazy. If there are particular things (parks, buildings, bridges, etc.) that I want to use heavily, I'll search for IMAGES on those so I'm fairly authentic in my descriptions. I'll use the ""street view"" on mapquest to SEE a particular area. I search for websites about communities within a city. Or search to find out what the locals call certain areas. I wrote a script set in San Fran (been there once, LOVED it!!) so I was only slightly familiar via memory, but it's so easy to research via the internet these days. I'll also go to the library and grab ""travel guides"" -- especially important for foreign countries or cities, where there's so much to know. Not that I use it all, but I want to FLAVOR my story with real stuff.   For your period piece, maybe find some historical fiction book to read. Or do museum searches. Or whatever. Sooo much info out there, the trick is to gather enough to feel smart and yet not waste too much time on that versus just writing and making stuff up.  My rule for ""books/reading"" on subjects is three. So when I wrote about an MMA fighter, I read 3 books on the sport. That's it. Visited a few websites. Gathered a few octagon images for my arsenal.

My recommendation would be to look at pictures. Tons of pictures. At least, that's what's easy for me. In the end, I want to believe that the filmmakers will recreate the place so I want to be accurate. But also, it helps me picture where I would ""block"" the scene, where would my characters go, where could the scene look more dramatic.

Screenwriting,3dm8um,WontonCarter,2,Fri Jul 17 12:22:20 2015 UTC,"Lots of fun stuff here. You clearly enjoyed writing this. I encourage you to keep writing, and to read a lot action comedy scripts. You'll get a better feeling for how line breaks, etc. can help your pacing. In general, you want to avoid large blocks of text (of which you have many).  I guess my main question is: What's the point of it all? What are you trying to say (about anything, really -- the working man, the human condition, inner-city crime)? Right now, it just reads as a bunch of arbitrary actions.   I'm questioning why the first scene is necessary. It'd be a bitch to produce with all of those extras waiting in line, and doesn't serve much of a purpose in Robbie's story.  Other thoughts:  -The parentheticals (frustrated, annoyed, yelling, looking down the alley etc.) are superfluous and can be cut. They're implied in your scene description.  -Characters don't talk to themselves this much (or in complete sentences) in real life: ""If that's Wayfield, Walnut can't be too far off. Might as well foot it."" I'm not sure if you need the line anyway (we'll pick up on it from the shots and the context).  -EXT. THE CITY is not a location unless you're talking about an aerial shot of the city or something. He's on a street.  -What kind of 6-man ""black-clad gang"" (or are they a swat team?) rips off delivery drivers? Seems a bit excessive. And why didn't they corner Robbie instead of watching Big Bad get kicked? Bit of a logic problem here.  -things kind of fly off the handle on page 3. Robbie is suddenly a kung fu master (or good enough to catch a punch)? You might think about planting this capacity earlier so it doesn't read like a deus ex machina. And why would the bad guys disperse? There are SIX of them and they're presumably armed."

Similarly, nearly all people don't have perfect pitch, but nearly everyone can learn a reasonable facisimile of it. A logline isn't the thing, it's a reflection of an understanding.

Everything I know, I learned the hard way.""  From the article in progress (it's long)  I don't relate to musicians who dismiss perfect pitch. I suspect jealousy factors into it, but willfully ignoring the ways it could be exploited seems like a deliberate failure of imagination. For starters, absolute pitch helps people with voice mimicry. Here are two others from The Straight Dope:  One University of Chicago music professor said he could conjure up an entire orchestral piece in his mind strictly from having read the sheet music. It was like reading a book to him. There were pieces he'd enjoyed for years before he'd physically heard them played. Snatches of seen-but-not-heard music would float into his mind the way we might remember an advertising jingle. He didn't own a stereo and didn't need one. He had an experience of music most people would never know.   One storied hacker was a blind kid named Joe Engressia. Most phreaks needed elaborate equipment to create the precisely pitched Touch-Tones necessary to operate the switching equipment. Not Engressia. Blessed with perfect pitch, he could whistle them.   From WaPo: Violin prodigy Joshua Bell: His parents, both psychologists, decided formal training might be a good idea after they saw that their [four year old] son had strung rubber bands across his dresser drawers and was replicating classical tunes by ear, moving drawers in and out to vary the pitch.   I have substantially more sympathy for the envious. It has to suck to know that you're forever blind to aspects of an art you love, an art you spend your life working in. They have my brief sympathy, but they should suck it up. It really doesn't matter. Most musicians don't have perfect pitch, but it doesn't stop them from making amazing music. Most people with perfect pitch don't exploit it, and end up being ordinary musicians with a side show talent.  For what it's worth, people with perfect pitch tiptoe around the subject. They tend to be aggressively modest about it, perhaps sensing that those not blessed don't want to hear about it. You don't see them railing about being the true musicians of the world, they don't diss ear training as hackery, and they don't get together to hate on ear training. It's just not in the music culture.  Even the most douchey have a kind of passive-aggressive “it's not that great,” attitude. They know they're superlatively gifted and not typical of the human condition. If anything, they're ashamed of not doing more with their gift."
Screenwriting,3dk08o,sajohnson,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:27:43 2015 UTC,"Interesting thoughts. From my own experience as a musician for the last twenty years, I've found no correlation between perfect pitch and actual music ability. Sure, it's helped people transcribe faster, along with other rated academic benefits. But I wouldn't correlate perfect pitch with musicality any more than I would connect perfect spelling with the ability to create compelling stories."

Possible, unusual.  I never said an awesome logline, I said  logline. A logline is a coherent direction. An idea of something. Let's say someone pitches me ""A man must save his wife from giving birth to the anti-christ..."" my first question is going to be ""how?"" Let's say this guy can write horror or action really well. If that second act suggests horror or action, cool. If it's set up in a series of Neil LaBute-like two character exchanges, and he can't write those, I'll be skeptical of it.  Can I ask about your process? How do you go about it? At what point does the ""finished"" idea crystalize? What's the furthest afield you've ever wandered? Do you write in one genre?

But loglines. Nope.  I honestly don't understand what the point of a logline is. Like what good does it do to reduce a screenplay down to a sentence before you start writing it? What is gained from it?   Plenty of awesome movies don't have good loglines and plenty of terrible movies have cant-miss loglines (I imagine), you know?   At what point does the ""finished"" idea crystalize?   Depends.   Once I wrote a SP that was pretty much like the idea I started with. But usually, this isn't the case.  I don't really start with a fully worked out thing. Like, if I were writing Escape from New York, I'd maybe start with ""What if New York was a huge prison?""  And then maybe come up with... ""Ok, so a criminal tries to escape to go to his mother's funeral...""  And then write a story about that... but halfway through realize,  realize, ""This would work be better if he wasn't a prisoner, but was a guy who had to go into New York to rescue someone else.""  And then change it to his mother, whose plane crashes there... and then go, WAIT, NO, THE PRESIDENT'S PLANE CRASHES THERE... plus, the main dude has an eye patch!""  Then, once I finished that story, I guess I could write a logline.   What's the furthest afield you've ever wandered?   I wrote a entire screenplay over about 7 months, realized it didn't work, tried very hard to fix it, but then scrapped the entire thing. Then I wrote another screenplay that took a few elements from the first one. That one worked out pretty well.   Have you ever set off with an idea set in 1900's England and had a finished product that ended up in alternate history 2450 confederate outer space?   Not really. More like, had an idea set in 1900 England among coal miners that turns into a story about the people who own the coal mine, only it's 1937.    Do you write in one genre?    So far."

It also helps you see which scenes don't fit and need to be reworked before writing the entire script. You also don't necessarily have to stick to the traditional story beats, but most audiences expect those beats to happen and without a lot of writing experience, trying to go outside those beats will often confuse the audience."

I have never written intending for it to actually be made, I may be weird in this aspect. I don't have intentions to make a living as a writer so just finishing something was huge to me.

I'm not sure you really get what a logline actually is, and what it's supposed to do. Which I think is why you keep giving really bad logline-related advice on this subreddit."
Screenwriting,3dk08o,Fly_By_Orchestra,5,Fri Jul 17 07:43:25 2015 UTC,"Now we're getting into the semantics of what a logline is. I don't have a logline structure. I have a premise test. A good logline makes what is spelled explicitly in the premise test implicit.  Sophia Augusta takes control of her life, her marriage, and her kingdom becoming Russia’s most celebrated and beloved monarch: Catherine the Great. Is implicitly:  A headstrong queen must take control of her life, her marriage, and history (she does this by) by surviving the tumultuous events of 1700's Russia, or else be swept away. She learns to trust herself and to defy the gender-norms of her time.  The logline unpacks well. It gives me a sense of genre (biopic with a lush historical backdrop), and a journey - the non-famous Sophia Augusta making a Norma Jean-like transformation into legendary Catherine the Great. The stakes, second act, and exploration are all in the legend of the subject.  We could make this logline shittier:  A biopic about Catherine the Great. Okay, fucking swell. What's interesting about that? That's a 1 hour TV documentary. The actual logline suggests the angle of attack and the journey.  Or, minus the myth. A princess must become take control of her kingdom and marriage to become the Greatest Queen of Zarnathia. - This is less good because Catherine the Great evokes something, this does not. What are Zartnathian customs? Are they matriarchal or not (crucial)? Is it a fantasy kingdom or not (crucial, and either way, I need some world building).  Here's a bad logline: A father must prevent his wife from giving birth to the Anti-Christ. This gives me no idea of how, and everything implicit is going to put me in mind of presumably better movies.  A premise test isn't a selling tool, as I've said a million times before. It's an exercise that makes sure your logline unpacks to... something. You seem to be conflating my premise test with a logline. Why?"
Screenwriting,3dk08o,er1339,2,Fri Jul 17 14:19:04 2015 UTC,"I take issue with you saying its not a selling tool. I see it as precisely that, because you're trying to get us to write sentences that can 'unpack' to something larger without us adding anything more. It's a skill to incite interest in our potential buyers. There's no other reason not to go expansive.  A premise test is useless for me as a writer because unless I can generate enough ideas myself I'll never get the thing written. And having a logline that sells itself doesn't mean I can generate good beats. The only way to do that is to do the writing of beats, exciting scenes etc.   If you're going to go down the planning route why not jump straight in there and see what you can think of rather than obsessing over two sentences that will be different once you're looking at a final draft.  I think your focus on loglines is simply an attempt to sell your services and a distraction for the amateurs, of which I am one, coming here for advice."

I respect your sentiment, but you're incredibly imaginative, as your work on the library logline shows. Given that your imagination works incredibly well in trying to prove me wrong, it shouldn't be a challenge to use it to try to prove me right. Why should you do my work for me? Fair point. If I was trying to be sly, I'd use reverse psychology and say you're not imaginative enough to come up with benevolent motivations for me claiming it's not a selling tool, but that would be pretty transparent.

Screenwriting,3dk08o,Ephisus,2,Fri Jul 17 05:45:36 2015 UTC,"I actually like most of your posts, not always for content but for sincerity. I think the other poster you're replying to has written great replies. My own take:  My umbrage is with your focusing on the 'premise test'. As I said, I don't think there's any better way to test the premise than brainstorming it and seeing how far you can get. A story is just a bunch of stuff that happens and your use of three acts means there's literally no constraints on what that stuff can be. Set up, happening, ending.  But just because I have a great idea espoused wonderfully in a logline, for all its richness, doesn't mean I know what 'the happening' is. The loglines you provide only suggest the direction of the script. Without actually exploring what could happen you're no closer to a script than not having a logline at all. But you suggest to people that there is no script without a logline.  And that's where I take issue. You put focus on the logline for people with no script, such that people are posting here looking for logline advice before they even start writing. I'm sorry but I just don't think that's good for them. If they are so inexperienced that they don't have the confidence to just write without seeking others' approval, why should we presume that once they have a logline everything will fall into place.   For me a better test would be to ask them why they are writing: what are the scenes they are truly passionate about, desperate to write, and what are they trying to say in the film, what emotion or experience is it vital they get across. From there they have pivotal moments that everything else builds to. And by seeing that you can then say 'you don't have enough content'.  It's more work, it's more useful. I'd argue that even if fewer people get advice they can learn more from the replies and how to analyse their own work.  And that's why I think there is a conflict of interest. I'm not saying you're doing it maliciously, I'm saying that the logline is your thing and seems to be key to your service (/ advice if that's too strong) and there's an inherent bias as a result. I think you do what you do here to help people, but I also think it can be at odds with what is actually best for a developing writer. You're flared, you're a judge, you post regularly and often. You admit when you're wrong and try and work that into your framework, but in the meantime you're coming off as an authority and there are people listening to your advice when it isn't necessarily 'correct' (whatever that means) or as polished as it should be.  But that's me, I'm not in the business, I'm not experienced. I've also always hated planning, until I started doing it for my novel and realised how much more quickly my ideas could evolve when structured. So maybe a logline is a good thing. There's enough discussion on your posts that no one should be in blind belief. I maintain it is too limited to put more than a few minutes of direct thought into.  I also think you've got your market wrong by selling it to people at the start of the process rather than the end. When I said 'selling tool' I was referring to the logline selling the script I've (theoretically) now completed and working out how to weight it for maximum impact. That's something I'd be really interested in having help with, and actually useful for getting noticed.    E: I actually think a really fun exercise might be to ask people to identify what say, Tarantino was passionate about in one of his films. I was about use IB but it's harder than it looks because I can see why he liked each scene. But I'd suggest it was built about the opening, the charismatic Jew Hunter, and the idea of killing Hitler in the most flamboyant, gruesome way. And from just those two concepts you get the direction of the film. What happens to the Jew Hunter; he sees the defeat of Germany coming and wants out. How is Hitler killed? Well how about the Jews get their revenge? Everything else is sliding pieces into place to allow that to happen. The bar scene stands out as unnecessary, and so is probably another pet scene. As the most memorable thing in the film I can believe it."

I believe that a great idea without the ""happening"" isn't a great idea. Therefore, I find what you're suggesting impossible.   The point of the premise test is to find the happening. Do you know what someone's face looks like when they realize the script they've been working on for two years has no happening and is set up in a way that makes finding the happening nearly impossible? When their dreams turn to ash in their hands and they give up? I do. The premise test comes from a possibly optimistic desire to lower the odds of that occurring.  Think of it this way. You know the value of ""happening"" and you know how hard it is to find that. If there were even a 1% of a premise test helping you find that, which is what I'm claiming, why wouldn't you want to engage with it?

I agree, a few cool scenes aren't enough and need to be expanded.   Amidst a war for humanity's survival, a man begins reliving the same day over and over.   Say that was the logline for All You Need Is Kill. To me that's immediately a cool idea. But is it a film? No, not until I start brainstorming ideas. And so, I see the need for a 'premise test', but it isn't until I start throwing things out and seeking what works and what doesn't that I can begin building a story. That is a separate thing to the logline and condensing it back down to a logline at that stage seems pointless.  Your example doesn't really have anything to do with the logline either. You emphasise it, but to actually explore the story you have to break away from it because inherently there's not enough information included. You ask pointed questions to draw out the beats and resolve that into a new logline. But without thinking out the beats and examining them for logic you don't get anywhere.   So, should people have an idea of what they're writing and what they want to get across? Absolutely, or else what are you writing? Do I agree that it should be some formal thing, revised over and over? Not at all.   I think that is a useful service and seeing that example I think our ideas are actually aligned it's just that you draw everything back to the logline when I don't think that's necessary. If anything I think it is unhelpful when first writing the script. With such a small amount of space the setup is emphasised and the following acts generalised."

The logline is inherent in the premise test and vice versa. Unpacking and repacking is really easy, especially compared to the text walls you're throwing up at me.  You intrigue me. You know you're a beginner. You roughly sense the importance of the middle. But read through this again. Not tonight, but tomorrow night, when you're not as emotionally connected to the words. Look at how hard you're working to avoid considering that what I'm saying might be useful. You're acting like drawing things back into a logline is somehow harder work than pitching a second act on a worthless library idea or writing these lengthy text blocks. Unlikely.  You either understand your story or you don't. If you do, a logline takes 20 seconds tops. If you don't, you'll find it easier to write a text wall of rebuttal than it is to consider the big, gaping hole where knowledge and understanding should be.

Screenwriting,3dki4j,WriterDuet,8,Fri Jul 17 00:26:04 2015 UTC,"HEEL - 10 Great title. It's about a wrestling Heel, and I see that straightaways. Clear who, what, where. Spartan description, clear picture. Nice bit of trade talk (kayfabe, I think the kids call it) in the brief exchange in the ring. Jesus fucking Christ, I instantly feel for Chuck. How did this happen? How does he feel? How will this affect his clearly deeply felt ambitions to be a wrestler (his career sucks (50 man audience) and people don't get into wrestling on a lark). I would turn the page.  I clearly liked this better than my fellow judges, but I'd like to call this the Tim Duncan of first pages. Not flashy, but so technically solid it blows my mind.   WATCHERS IN THE WOODS - 6 Action lines 1 and 6 could probably be shorter. So could 9. Nitpicky, but this is a one page contest. I recognize that this was structured to have the title drop on the end of the page (smart) but that additional space could answer one question: when the hell are we? Even if this is to be a fakeout, like THE VILLAGE (we think it's old times, but it's not), I'd like to know if these are modern anachronisms, or if this is bronze age stuff. I don't really know what a heirophant is, generally, they're Ancient Greek, but the congregation speaks Latin and they seem monotheistic, which puts this at a later date. Little details, like the kind of metal the censer or the general aesthetic of the village in the distance is would have helped.  UNTITLED CHAD BOROSTRUM- 8 The end is awesome on the page, but unintentionally hilarious if you literally picture it. Is her face covered with C4? Arms? Legs? Is it like a C4 skirt or C4 pants? All the celebs will see is someone in black blocks, which could well be a fashion designer's quirky offering. Without a timer and wires, what causes them to run screaming? Does Taylor Swift recognize the C4? Or is it Kim Kardashian? or Anna Wintour? I love the idea of these fops instantly recognizing the weapon they're facing and the danger they're in. This is a weird one, because the author actually said:  If I could get a mulligan I'd describe it a little better. In my mind's eye her 'dress' is bedecked with C4. Nothing amateurish, very professionally assembled. She's holding a tablet with some choice words/images that everyone in the audience can see. Technically he could have changed it and kept his upvotes and stayed within the letter of the rules, so let's reward honesty and pretend he did that and give him a gentleman's eight.  Untitled – BlueSunTsu – 7 Here's why formatting matters: you want everything that's not supposed to be ambiguous to be clear enough that intentional ambiguity looks intentional. There is nothing worse than a script that shows a snippet of a “bad script” where the in-universe bad script reads as better than the source. Even if you assume that formatting doesn't matter, it's a major context clue for the reader. Why is the WHIRR sound capitalized but character names not? Why do we only learn who Fran is in the second shot she appears in, not the first? Why does every other character get a specific age but not Fran? Are all the continuous shots really continuous? If the formatting were on point (or even consistent), I'd be inclined to assume the best, but they're not so I do not.  This one page raises a lot of questions. Fran is an old woman in slippers and a bathrobe walking through knee high snow. Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ! That would be fucking freezing. I'd like to see if she presses on despite the cold, of if she doesn't feel it. Charlie appears to find this worthy of note, but not enough to immediately stop drinking his tea. Is he worried? Does he like Fran? Hate Fran? She appears to do this all the time, but does she always do it half-naked in knee high snow? Finally, when Fran slips down the hill, is she lucid or out of her mind? Intentional or unintentional? You want me to assume the best, and that all these ambiguities are conscious choices, not failures of technique, but the formatting gaffes don't put me in mindset.  Finally, let this be a teachable moment that life isn't fair. I've talked to BlueSunTsu before and he has been nice, polite, and thoughtful. Hollywood is a relationship business, so let this be a microcosm of that. Because he was nice before it counted, I'm going to show some bias and rate this higher than my gut reaction tells me to.  UNTITLED SOCIAL MASK - 3 This opens with a technique I actually like, establishing a shot before a slugline. But it stays there too long. I have to go half a page before I realize she's in a bed. Context clues like duvet, comforter, or sheets would probably negate this note. If you do this technique, do the close up first, then establish INT. SOPHIE'S BEDROOM – NIGHT as soon as possible. Otherwise, it raises questions: what kind of room is it, does she sleep alone (single bed) or in the bedroom she shares with James? We'd see that in a movie. Why do we see Sophie's age but not James's?  Also, what the hell is going on here? Who did she think was touching her? Is she in that transient dream state? Did she wake up when she giggled or when her eyes open? It's ambigious, and the other ambiguities don't incline me to read this kindly.  James is a zombie is underwritten. It relies on me to fill in a generic zombie from pop culture archetypes, but it comes from that same place that tells me that zombies don't talk and zombies don't have sex lives. Is he a zombie? Is he a dead man reanimated (Frankenstein's monster)? A revenant? I'm confused. Also, from context I assume that Sophie knows that James is dead, but was he lost at sea, or buried in a tux? A description of him being a zombie would clue me in.  What does James want here? Clearly, some of his psyche is intact, but does he have rocks in his head? What's his game plan: I look non-human and monstrous, but my girlfriend who thinks I'm dead will clearly be happy to see me when I surprise her in the dead of night, which would be scary and destabilizing even if I looked totally human. From context, I sense that he isn't there to kill her, but what was he expecting? The fact that he's trying to look appealing suggests he knows how fucked up this is, but why did he break into the house rather than just telephone. The next page probably explains this, but as this is a one-page contest, I can't assume the best there.  Village Street tells me nothing. Is it a street of a village or a famous street in Chicago I haven't heard of. Apparently this is park lodge style, which I had to google, which took me out of the script, which is a place you don't want my attention to be. There are houses surrounding it, but I don't know the density. Even if I hold “park lodge” is something that every fool knows, and even if I give it the benefit of the doubt that that fact is incredibly important later, I highly doubt that it's more important to know the architectural style of some suburban manse than it is to know basic visual details about the primary monsters of this high concept.  What is a zombie's meal? Is it a roadkill? A cat? An old lady? A still living pregnant mother who moans feebly as she dies, her baby eaten out of her? What do zombies eat? Brains, presumably, but the part of me that knows that also knows that zombies don't talk. Are these zombies freshly killed and bloody, or are they more the greenish-fresh from the graveyard version as seen in the Simpsons and Plants versus zombies? The writer does, but I don't know.  What do the zombies want? Is Sophie in mortal danger, or are all zombies her ex boyfriends come to engage in foreplay.  THE THIRD ASTRONAUT - 6 Why does “uh” get two commas in the first line, but only one comma when used in seemingly the same context in the second line. Is it the same context? Is this a grammatical rule I don't know? Is this a question I should have on the first line of a script.  Points for spelling out 1956. While I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a chyron on screen or a note to a reader, I am delighted that I don't have to figure out what time period I'm in from context clues like the years of operation of the F-86, which frankly, I don't know and I don't necessarily want to know. Good clarity here. I need to know this info, and it was given to me.  Swiss Clock factory of dials is a term I wouldn't necessarily use, but a damn stylish one, and I like that the author has a sense of style. This actually wins me back from the stupid typo note – maybe this fella knows what he's doing after all. And then I get confused by whether the pilot is Mike or not. If he's not, he looks like Mike, if he is, why isn't he credited as Mike, who I suspect is the hero of this story (note that I made a usage error in a review I'm doing that nitpicks typos and clarity).  From context clues, I imagine that this will be the story of Michael Collins, a brave, great American who went to the moon and yet somehow faded to obscurity. That's a cool idea, but the current placement of the Apollo stuff doesn't give me a clear idea of what angle the story is going to take, and I had to do a lot more work to make a “Michael Collins” connection that I should have."

My feedback is that it's ""okay"" - nothing stands out as bad, but I felt kind of weird but still not interesting. I'm seeing all this crazy pants stuff, but at least to me it didn't feel important, or funny (just unusual).  Then we see they're filming a commercial, and I wonder if the pants even matter - was that just to introduce the characters' job? I don't know. Are the characters as unusual as the pants? Doesn't feel like that.  So I have no idea what the tone is of the script, and what's important. The rest of the script may totally clarify that, but I think the best 1 pages take you into the world and establish comfort with the writing immediately - this one left me a bit uncomfortable, like I had no idea why I was reading this, and I would personally just put it down."

Screenwriting,3dl169,RavensBrew,6,Fri Jul 17 03:15:58 2015 UTC,"4 minutes (or in this case, one third of your entire film) is a lot of time. Montages are meant to be a succession of quick scenes showcasing the passage of time, and I'd be surprised if most conventional montages went over 30 seconds.   You could argue that Pixar's UP makes a case against that, but in their 4 minute montage we go through Carl and Ellie's entire lives together. Where as, you state that you just need to show your characters simply falling in love. So without further details of what happens before and after they fall in love, it's hard to really know how to work it."
Screenwriting,3dl169,bananabomber,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:29:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, now that you call that to my attention I totally agree with you... The idea is a guy who has a dead end job (and life?) meets up with friends at a bar. A girl comes into the bar and meets the guy. They fall in love. Later the girl dies. The point of the dead end job (and life) is to give more meaning and impact (hopefully) to the relationship to make it even more devastating when there is loss. This motivates him to make decisions later in the story that he otherwise might not make.  Some Googling brought me to one example where instead of the traditional montage they just skipped right to a scene in bed. The couple is not touching but rather the guy, who, it has been established, has emotional barriers, is finally telling the story of his tragic childhood. I thought this was wonderful but am not sure I will have the time to incorporate something so detailed. I need to keep brainstorming- something will come to me when I'm half asleep hopefully!"

Screenwriting,3dl169,scooter_pooter,2,Fri Jul 17 08:06:12 2015 UTC,"My first idea would be to have them meet, have a ""the one"" type of moment (throw in the title card), then cut to a scene that displays they've been together for a while and have been in love since they first laid eyes on each other.  You can use this to set up the conflict, add a running joke or what have you. The point being in a 12 minute short you can probably skip the montage, show the audience they have history and viewers should buy it for whatever comes next."

Screenwriting,3dl169,CelestinRay,2,Fri Jul 17 04:02:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe have a read of Robert Coover's short story 'Going for a Beer'. Or listen to it here:  http://downloads.newyorker.com/mp3/fiction/150501_fiction_ferris.mp3  It's a humourous and poignant take on what you are trying to do.   I think the 'falling in love over a shared interest' thing is maybe a little superficial. We fall in love with the person, not their taste in films. For it to be a bit more satisfying try something like this:  1) establish what is missing in the boy's life   2) establish what is missing in the girl's life   3) when boy meets girl, if you've set it up correctly, the audience should know that each is exactly what the other is missing  4) show the characters realising this fact   That's it. You could do it in 4 scenes, you could do it in 1.   This is much, much, much harder to write than simply 'they fall in love because they both like French films'. This is why you see so many rom-coms take the short cut with the 'shared interest' trope - because it's easier to write. Try to be better than that. If you really want the story to be satisfying for the audience  and to be believable, you'd do well to tap into something deep inside each character, a universal want,  something profound."

Screenwriting,3dl169,tpounds0,2,Fri Jul 17 07:01:26 2015 UTC,"I would do it with the following scenes:   First meeting at the bar. Someone introduces them. [Half to one page. Single take, wide shot.] Couple of hours later they've opened up and the dude who introduced them is gone. Empty glasses on the table, relaxed look, bar mostly empty, dude is sharing a funny and embarrassing story, girl laughs, then kisses him. [Two pages. Medium. No close-ups. Standard dual and over-the-shoulder shots cut together.] INT Apartment, dark. Door opens, the smooching couple basically falls in, dude switches on the lights, girl turns them off, intense (but tasteful) lovemaking is implied. [Half to one page. Wide to medium to close-ups.] INT Apartment, overexposed, bright morning, alarm clock. Dude wakes up. The girl is already in the bathroom. Dude joins. We show that they've established a morning routine, even going so far as to share the bathroom together. Their hair is different. They're heading to respective jobs and discuss shared routines e.g. either needs the other to pick up a cake for visiting either's parents. Sell the cake to the audience. Have either character describe it in detail. [Two pages at most. Give the audience time to adjust to the temporal shift. Medium over the bed to wide to cutting between them.] Dinner at e.g. the girl's parents place. Pleasant things are discussed. Guy expresses hope of having a child one day. Says he trusts her implicitly. Something dark is looming in the eyes of others. [Four to five pages. Give the audience breathing time after the temporal rush, build some implied suspense. Fill the dead air with a very low volume TV in the far far background. Start with mediums, then go wide for the foreshadowing, framing the dinner party in golden light surrounded by dark shadows.] Dad flips through the channels on the TV while mom starts serving cake. Dad switches the TV off. Everyone takes a first bite, except dad. Dad blurts out that everyone knows except the guy. Apparently the girl is terminally ill and has told her family, but not her boyfriend. Dude's trust is shaken to the core, but he bottles it up. [Two pages. Start with an extreme close-up on the dad's face to really jar the audience. Since the TV is now off, you get dead air, which ups the tension.] Dude and girl driving home. Callback to the story he told when they first met. ""I've never told anyone else about that. You were the first. The only. Something about you made me trust you implicitly. How could you not have told me about your condition?"" Basically hurt feelings are aired. Girl responds, but does not engage on an emotional level. Dude does not flip out completely. He's just hurt. [Two pages. Standard driving shots. Let some of the tension dissipate, but only, at most, half.] We see the dude from very far away pushing a wheelchair somewhere beautiful on a sunny day. We get close-ups on his face as he talks to someone in the wheelchair. We get shots from behind. He turns into what we realize is a cemetary. Far shot as they stop at a headstone. Camera behind the headstone as we finally see that it's the dude and the girl's mother visiting the girl's grave and leaving flowers. [One page. Building more tension.] CUT TO: Night, rainstorm, dude alone at the cemetary, crying at the grave. [You've built enough tension at this point to turn this into a violent dissipation of tension with all the necessary exposition you need to do. This scene is the payoff for everything up to this point and the setup for everything to come. Go nuts and do your thing as best you can. OR if you need the momentum to carry the audience into the rest of the story, just do a ten second cut to a wide shot of him doubled up at the grave and crying and then cut to a bright shot that takes the story forward in another scene.]"

Screenwriting,3di18v,theaartzvolta,5,Thu Jul 16 13:04:26 2015 UTC,"Hi! I've worked in the industry for roughly four years, some in LA, but most recently in Toronto. Not as a writer, but as someone with that ""aspiring"" tag next to their title I'll tell you a bit of what I've learned.   It really is all about who you know. I spent 2012-2014 flipping between marketing jobs and daily production gigs as I tried to grind my way into the industry. Then I made a friend who got me on as a daily on 12 Monkeys and I haven't stopped working since. I haven't applied for any of these jobs, but rather been recommended for them by contacts I'd made and by working hard with the team I was placed with.    If you don't know anyone in the industry I would recommend checking out the OMDC list and emailing productions asking if they need ""daily office PAs"". That is the best way to get in and meet teams. If you know anyone with access to the DGC Hotlist it is a better resource than OMDC. However, I don't know anyone personally that has had success in this manner. Especially if you have zero experience. I respond to dozens of e-mails like this a day essentially saying ""thanks, but no thanks."" Don't be discouraged this is just the reality.   That's where this second piece comes in. Visit mandy.com and find productions looking for low/no pay labour. Get on with them and learn what it takes to work in this industry. Make friends with the people you've worked with and pray it leads to something else. If you're young and/or you have some financial security I recommend attending Humber or Ryerson to get a basic education in the industry. The education is almost entirely useless, but the connections aren't. Keep writing, enter contests. If you write something small try and find funding to get it made. Not your own money mind, but perhaps something like a BravoFact grant and get in that way. Don't be afraid to cold call agents with your material, just make sure it's something you're willing to stand by. Attend InkDrinks, a gathering of working writers in Toronto at the end of every month. This is something you'll need to find yourself I won't hand it to you. Facebook is a good place to start. Volunteer. At TIFF or elsewhere, get to know people at your level who are trying to break into the industry. They probably know more than you do and might be willing to help after they get in. Consider doing literally anything else. This is a cruel and unforgiving industry. Much of it is feast or famine and very few people actually succeed. If you can imagine yourself being happy doing literally anything else. Do it.   Good luck and please let me know if you have additional questions."

Are there indie movie houses or indie festivals (aside from the biggie/obvious one) going on nearby you can go hang out at and meet people, start quizzing, etc? Maybe an indie production going you could volunteer to help on in some capacity. Or a locally produced show of some sort ... interning? Visiting?   Just my two cents.......  Of course, you may well find a Toronto writer on this feed, but just saying, if you don't, plenty of options to pursue. Unless you've already done all that, of course......."

These people will ask you what happened, you look at them and say it was a small fire that was getting out of hand, but you were able to stop it. When they ask how show them the screenplay, and say ""this screenplay...it literally saved the studio"".

It's good advice if you take your job as an opportunity to learn as much as you can, make friends, and impress people in whatever capacity you're hired to do. It's terrible advice if you take it to mean to try to leverage your job as a way to pitch your script to a bunch of people just because you happen to be near them.   Look, here's the right way to leverage any sort of inside access:  1) Be awesome at what you're being paid to do.  2) Be somebody that people like.   3) If somebody asks you what you ""really"" want to do, feel free to mention that you also write.   4) If they further ask you what sort of stuff you write, you can tell them the genre/style.   5) If they seem legitimately interested you can toss them a logline.   The sort of context this is most likely to come up is, say, some of your direct coworkers and you gong to lunch together because that's what people in the same office who like each other do.   If people feel like you're angling to a chance to pitch your script, or if you're there for reasons other than your actual job, then you'll be out on your ass with remarkable speed."
Screenwriting,3dhe0i,HotspurJr,8,Thu Jul 16 16:09:29 2015 UTC,"First you must realize there are probably dozens if not hundreds of employees on the lot that are looking to do the exact same thing you are.   Second you should understand that your script is not going to be purchased by the studio for which you work. It's immensely poor business practice for them to do so.   Third come to appreciate just how fortunate you are to have even made it this far. Even if you're just cleaning offices, getting a job at a studio is no mean feat. So well done. If this is as far as you go, that's still good.  The best way to leverage this job is to make friends. Or work friends at least. Develop a trust with them and become a reliable friend, not worker, friend. After some time you'll meet people through them and be able to leverage those contacts on to bigger and better things. Never, ever ask the people you work with to help you within the company or sell your script. I mean shit man, they're trying to do the same thing you are.  And most of all, remember that this is a two way street. If you see an opportunity to help someone out, take it. This industry is cold and impersonal, but it does recognize the 'no good deed' rule. So keep an eye out for chances to help others.  Good luck, keep writing."

And I can tell you that the corporate offices for your company are not in that complex. But...that probably doesn't really matter for what you're working toward.   I also had the good fortune to work at several studios and have been able to sell scripts to each one of them. Here's how you do it.   Be EXCELLENT at your actual job. No one will be impressed with your amazing script if you aren't doing what you were hired to do. Being excellent at your job will also allow you to make the professional connections that may lead to better opportunities.  Be an enjoyable person. No one will be impressed with your amazing script if you are a pain in the ass. Being an enjoyable person will also help you make the professional connections that may lead to better opportunities. Remember that no one at the studio is under any obligation to read or promote your work. This is just good to remember so that you have perspective.  Commit to spending time to build relationships--real relationships where people can count on you and you are adding value to people's lives.  Make sure that your writing is studio quality. When the opportunity does come to give someone a script, that will likely be your one opportunity and you don't want to blow it.   Don't force your scripts on anyone. As you develop relationships, you'll start to learn more about others' long term goals and when the time is right, they'll learn about yours. As you move further into these relationships, you can ask for advice about mentors and ask if people know who you might talk to about pitching or selling.   If you are newer to writing and you're not ready to sell or pitch, focus on mentorship. Learn from the experts who are around you.   For me, I did all of the above. After about 6 months, I eventually asked a producer if I could pitch to him. He said that I could, but that they probably wouldn't buy anything. I chose to hold off on pitching until he seemed more amenable to the idea. One day, the show was one story light for the week, (they were supposed to turn in 5 to executives, they only had 4). I asked if I could pitch, they said yes, and they bought the story.   Hope this is helpful! See you on Flower!"

Shit like this happens.   There's a film coming out in Scandinavia right now, where it turned out the female lead couldn't act. She'd been great in auditions, everything was a-okay, but when they started filming - she couldn't act for some reason.  They had to change everything on the fly and in the editing room. I haven't seen the result yet, but stuff like this happen.   Works the other way around too. A lot of people working on the Bourne Ultimatum, including Matt Damon, thought it was going to turn out to be a crap movie, but it didn't.   Phil Lord and Christopher Miller recently said in an interview that the Lego Movie didn't work at all, until they got to sound mix.   There's also other stuff to consider. Sometimes the train is just rolling, and you might find out at somepoint that the movie might not be good, but what are you going to do? Walk away? Or try and fight and make it the best movie you can.   I haven't seen The Nines, so I don't know if August ""should have known better"", I don't think you can look at it that way.

And because of that I'd often recommend passing on a script.  There were 4 to 6 readers, if we all passed on a script, the producers wouldn't look at it and get rejected.  That's why in Hollywood they always say: ""be nice to the script readers"""

The concept was a bit confusing in the way it was executed.    Nailed it.  I even listened to the director's commentary with August and Reynolds, and even that falls under what I've quoted you.  It's as if he didn't properly translate his ideas on screen and assumed everyone would understand or eventually catch on."

It's interesting and kinda liberating. And you're right, a thousand things can be responsible for that. I think he was way too ambitious. Happens to the best. Look at George Lucas or Francis Ford Coppola, when they had no one around anymore to question what they were doing, they did some pretty shitty movies for sure. I think even Quentin Tarantinos movies since Kill Bill were pretty average and I loved that dude. Inglorious Basterds and Django bored the shit out of me.

Her sliding door concept that growing up poor is better has a flaw in the story concept: Fam of 4: they grow up rich & turn out bad-why?-then the same people- Fam of 3: they grow up poor with a mom that loves them & turn out good?-Why?  What about child support if the father left? And if the same people have the same core value what changed? If the story is about parallel lives where in one scenario the dad lived and in another he died, that would have been more plausible, as it stands right now it doesn't work.

I also learned how to write on the fly.  I used to write for a sports blog, often I was writing while I was in the field with only a few hours to send out the material.  The other writer I worked with couldn't do that and I often found myself having to re-write his work (at his request). I did it a few times and stop 'cause he wasn't learning how to write and long term it wouldn't benefit him as a writer."

I'm getting into the practice of being more thorough with it, I tend not to do any big, drastic changes because i don't think I need to. But I've gotten better at figuring out where the big faults are and how to fix them.   With editing an actual movie, it's more entertaining and more liberating, I guess because you just have no choice, as you say. You have to work with what you've got. In writing, you can see a million possibilities ahead of you. But with editing, you have very specific materials and it's always cool to remix them somehow. A while back I edited a short film of mine with a friend and we put ourselves in the goal of making a character seem less aggressive, and it was a matter of using wider shots, more close-ups of other characters and cutting out certain beats of the scene and it worked. I hope I can get to that place where I can be really creative with my rewriting, a I tend to be when I'm editing a scene or a movie.   P.S.

The joke with the diner being full doesn't work, because the set up of the joke involves 2 characters, but the punch line comes from a third character that wasn't involved in the set up. Brian, not Ron, should have delivered the punch line IMO.   You force a character to answer a question about his memoir, and so Ron says one line, then the conversation switched again to Brick with a scorpion. You're forcing the conversation to go in 2 different directions at once, and it just doesn't work  The ""our cuisine is fine"" insert unclassy cuisine joke was done too much, and the ""how do you know what salt water filled condoms tastes like?"" ""Don't worry about it"" Is kind of a cop out of what could have been an interesting story. It's a cheap joke, that's probably better off not being put in the script.

I've had scripts do well in one place and get zero recognition in others. I've even had what is almost the same script get top 15% in the Nicholl one year, place in the Quarters the next year, then not even in the top 30% the year after that. It completely depends on the luck of the draw and what your reader(s) respond to. If the first reader doesn't like it, you're pretty much DOA. Granted, there has to be at least some level of objective quality, but for the most part, the people judging these contests appear to be completely subjective in their opinions. Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't. It really just means you have to be both good AND lucky.   You do what you can to do the best you can. That's really all there is.

Anywhere outside of the top two or three is generally rubbish so I don't think it's worth worrying about the difference between quarterfinalist and top 30%.

Ultimately, look, the cards have been dealt, you just haven't looked at them yet. Expectations are meaningless regardless. I have a script that won one of the big contests and didn't get out of the first round of others. I have a script that got passed on by 15 managers but I'm in negotiations with the first producer I sent it to.   Iacta Alea Est.   If your expectations are high, what does that mean? Keep writing. Make the next script better than this one. Keep working to improve and build your portfolio.   If your expectations are low, what does that mean? Keep writing. Make the next script better than this one. Keep working to improve and build your portfolio.   Your expectations are irrelevant to what you need to do, so just keep doing it."

I'm talking about one scene that all takes place in the middle of a street (possibly with some characters running in and outside of a house). To put it in different terms: theoretically the scene I have could be filmed in one continuous take without even moving the camera; i.e. it exists as a single scene naturally, not because I forced it to be."

Overpopulation is so bad that extreme measures must be taken. Cool. But choosing a person who gets to kill two people seems like a really strange way to go about it. I could see the government start increasing executions in prisons. Or if you wanted the general population to be affected, maybe it's just a random lottery and those people chosen are executed without question.  But I also understand you want to give this power to a person. I just can't figure out a plausible explanation for why they would give this power to a person.  I could see giving this power to a committee that choses people in the population who may be worthless in some way. But again, not a person.  So what am I missing here? Explain it to me.

It's offered to anyone who was deemed ""worthy"" of it, whether it be making a certain amount of money, making a significant advance in science, or being a prominent social activist or religious leader.  Basically the ""best"" of us.  I wrote the system in the way I did because of all the other side effects that would come with it.  If you're a criminal and you don't know if the guy next you is able to kill you without any legal backlash, you might think twice about trying to steal from them or whatever.  Increased prison executions wouldn't have the same effect.  Criminals committing a crime aren't planning to get caught in the first place, but there's no real measure they can take to make sure the person they're messing with won't kill them, especially in this world where using your legal murders is almost encouraged.

Mostly in regards to telling one thing. Movies are about telling one thing. Look at how the first scene of the movie basically encapsulates the whole movie. Almost every scene after that is basically a reiteration of that scene.  It tells you everything you need to know about the movie, while still being entertaining.   God I love that script. And it really is about something.  What I found really fascinating was the everything that's in the movie, is in the script. I'm talking about the experience, the emotion. Consider that.

Screenwriting,3de33x,Daver2442,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:49:16 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of tricky issues with something like that.   First of all, Disney doesn't hold the copyright on the original story, but they do on their films, so you would have to be very careful about  not using any element of the story that originated with them - which, I'd wager, is more than most of us would guess.   Secondly, the thing about public domains works is that you need to be really making sure you're making strong choices and showing off your skills as a writer. Remember that most scripts don't get made, so you're really trying to write something that says, ""I'm ridiculously awesome and you want to work with me.""  Getting the script sold or made is a bonus.   So, if you were to do a fairly straightforward adaptation of the original Cinderella material, the problem is: what's selling YOU about that script? Why do I need you, even if I like the idea? (I mean, it's a public domain story, you can't own the idea of filming it, and you can't own specific ideas in it that aren't original to you).   So with public domain adaptations, you really need to find a way to make it your story. How is this Cinderella adaptation going to be fundamentally something that is an expression of who you are as an artist? So you're probably much better off taking the original story as a jumping off point and creating what really feels like a completely original story inspired by the original.   ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is probably a good example, here. This is fundamentally not the ""Snow White"" story in the way we all know it.   I'm actually in the process of retrofitting a script of mine to fit an established set of legends, so that the producer and I can sell it as, ""The real story behind (blank)."" Aside from the names, very little in the first two acts of the script is going to change. The third act is going to be drastically different from my original version. But the thing is, nobody would ever say, ""Oh, you're just parroting that story."" The DNA of the completely original script is always going to be there - so even if somebody else wanted to do ""The real story behind (blank)"" it would be drastically different from my project."

If you want to actually get the adaptation made, you should have the rights for the book. The easiest way to do this (you're possibly not gonna like this...) is to write a different, original script that is really good and gets you a ton of attention. After that script gets you on the blacklist or gets you a manager or gets you a meeting, someone will ask you ""what do you want to do next?"" You then say, ""There is this great book. We should see if the rights are available!"" This seems convoluted but is the actual easiest route because they are almost never going to give these rights to just some guy with nothing to back this up but his desire. You have to change who you are and become someone important. Then you can option the rights and write the script."

Screenwriting,3dg1dh,davideocave,3,Wed Jul 15 23:58:43 2015 UTC,"Sounds (at least the imagery) a lot like IT FOLLOWS.  If you haven't seen it, it's a movie where something disguised as people, follows someone, eventually killing them, if it reaches them.  The only way they can get rid of it is to pass it on through sex.  Anyway, the following thing sounds a lot like that movie.  Whatever you write, I'd just make sure it doesn't seem too similar.  Try to keep it original.  For example: maybe, have the person who follows the addict, be the dead version of the addict, somewhat hinting at how they die, even, and once it reaches them, it takes his / her place, as the addict moves on and becomes ""addiction"".  He follows someone new, and when he reaches them is when they become addicted to something, and the dead version of the new addict, follows them, etc.  It kind of portrays the endless cycle, etc.  I was a heroin addict for about 7 years, and it really is endless bullshit to go through.  I died from an OD back in 06, and even then, I was revived and came right back into it.  It was endless, no matter what.  It took moving to a different continent to get me to stop.  While it isn't necessarily like this in reality, I can say, there are certain aspects of addiction and especially the withdrawal period, where it really feels like this.  I had a big problem with sounds when I would go through withdrawal.  If I listened to a song, it would literally be looped in my head for days, or until I got high again.  That song would just not leave me alone.  You can't sleep, either.  That insomnia follows you until you get high again.  Dreams get weird when you can fall asleep, etc.  Maybe you can venture into that.  Have more than one thing following the addict, to represent each one of these... ""addiction monster"", ""sound monster"", ""insomnia monster"", etc.  And gurv, that's not cool, man.  It doesn't really matter what we think of the idea itself.  He's not asking to be judged on the concept, he's asking for help on how to write it.  What if every project you decided to work on, someone deterred you from it, because they thought it was silly, etc?  You'd never get anything done.  While I do agree that 3-6 minutes isn't long enough for any short film, he should be able to write what he wants without judgment before it's even finished."

Can you find 18 scenes that convey the six ideas?  Does the addiction character have to be dressed the same way all time?  Can Addiction have party clothes to convey one thing and rags to convey something else and combat clothes for something else?  Can Addiction be different genders?  You are just doing ideas now, you aren't thinking about how to film.   You might find if you do this, your six ideas will gel into one idea done a few ways. Or three ideas that will serve as beginning, middle, end. In a short, you often have an idea to explore, rather than a narrative to convey.     The conflict is between your protag and addiction. Which causes protag to be in conflict with the world around him.  BTW, not everyone is addicted. It's an addict's cop-out philosophy. So, maybe explore what ""addicted"" really means. Then how culturally trivialized it is."

As in: incorrect. Things aren't facts because we believe they are. There isn't a shred of evidence that ""addiction"" is a universal human trait.  And plenty of people who are not addicted to anything to demonstrate otherwise.    As an artist, you may want to delve into the integrity of your message at least somewhat.  Knowing why some are and some aren't, helps you find ways of conveying the truth.   Or don't. Your choice.   As for the rest, they are just exercises to help you get the handle on your story you wanted, not suggestions of what you should do.   The other answer is to go educate yourself about structure. Start with Aristotle and work forwards."
Screenwriting,3dg1dh,tbone28,2,Thu Jul 16 18:35:57 2015 UTC,"What is the message you want to convey?   I was thinking about writing about addiction and how it all affects us in one way or another.    Drug addiction is described a lot like being controlled. A puppet. But here is one way that it could be done.   You follow the life of a guy who has it all together. Great job, house, marriage, kids etc. Whatever that is to you. Going to the gym. Eating healthy and hanging out with friends. All the great parts. But progressively show this drug addicted person showing up in every scene. And the guy looks at him and ignores him at first. Gradually starts noticing him and looking at him with shame and disgust. Until finally the guy confronts the drugged guy and tells him to leave him alone. At that moment you see the drug addict wake up from his dream. Another drug addict is shaking him asking him what he is thinking about. And he says, ""Nothing."" And does his drug of choice.   That shows the shame utter despair of drug addiction. And how easy it is to not care.   You mentioned ""The truth is... We're all addicted."" I don't know what the message is there. Yes, we are all addicted. To breathing. But there are good addictions and bad addictions right?"

If you boil down why people do what they do it really comes down to two things. Gain Pleasure, Avoid Pain. We are on this constant path to change our state of mind. We watch movies to FEEL things. Sometimes to feel something different than what we normally feel.   When you realize we are all truly alone or that fact that we ARE going to die someday, it messes with your head. Our beliefs about life are so fragile. I mean it's totally possible to kill yourself with shock. You can shock your mind by simply thinking about something. Of course, our brains protect ourselves from this.   I think this is why part of our brain is conscious and the other part is off limits. There is ONLY so much one can handle.

Screenwriting,3ddabe,tpounds0,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:22:14 2015 UTC,"One of the things I do with characters is I keep track of their needs and how they are going about getting them. The 6 human needs are a great model (first heard about this from Anthony Robbins)  The great thing about these needs are they are mutually exclusive.  [Certainty ---- Uncertainty] [Connection  --- Uniqueness/Significance] [Contribution --- Self-Improvement]  Certainty: We all need to know there is a rhyme and reason to things. The floor won't fall out on us. Things we can depend on. When we are pursuing this need actively it's because things are changing too much or unpredictable.   Uncertainty: Another way to look at this is surprise. We need new things to keep interested. When we have too much of the same.   So when your character gets too much certainty they will shift back to more uncertainty. Based on your characters beliefs and how they feel the best way to meet these needs you can keep the conflict and growth going.   Same with connection and uniqueness. The more you relate with people the more you lose your uniqueness. The more unique you are the harder it is to connect with people.   The last two are fulfilled by the method people use to fulfill the first four. But you can see when you are contributing to others you are focusing on them rather than improving your self.   Now, the methods that people try and meet their needs can be valued as such: Good for the character Good for others Good for the greater good  When the character is, let's say, selfish, they will be doing things good for them but not others and the greater good. This is an opportunity to grow. They may be trying to meet their need to feel significant/unique and doing it in a selfish way."

Will it be a story of a priest on the run, hunted by those that know what he saw? Or will it be a heartwarming tale of a Priest transported from his comfortable life in the city to a little town in the midwest where he teaches everyone a little bit about love and tolerance and in turn is taught something.

Screenwriting,3dehcv,thehollowman84,2,Wed Jul 15 17:40:48 2015 UTC,"First-timer at writing a logline...was trying to keep it as straight-foward as possible, so that's why it's a bit sparse.  Guess I've been reading the wrong sources on how to write one!  The plot is more about story of a priest on the run.  Priest witnesses one of his church members murder another church member over dealing prescription drugs.  Priest flees and enters witness protection, is assigned a female cop for protection.  Priest runs away from witness protection when his own secrets start to come out.  Cops and bad guys end up pursuing him.    As story goes on, we learn that the priest has demons of his own.  He's a veteran, early 30s, suffers from PTSD, and is addicted to anti-anxiety meds.  He's an orphan; was raised by his uncle, who died slowly and excruciatingly of cancer when the priest was a teenager.  The protagonist joins the Army and becomes a field medic.  He watches people get maimed, suffer, and die in Iraq.  Comes back from war, joins the seminary and becomes a priest.    He's struggling as a priest; gives terrible sermons, is relatively young, and some faithful at church think he tries too hard.  But he's conflicted by his uncle's death and by carnage he witnessed in Iraq.  He ends up using his field medic skills to secretly help a handful of people commit suicide as they're dying of terminal illness.  He gets a heavy dose of Catholic guilt and decides to stop.    Right after deciding to stop the priest witnesses this murder.  The victim is a pharmacist who was secretly supplying him with the barbiturates for the suicides.  The priest stays in witness protection long enough to develop a relationship with the female cop who's assigned to him, but then flees when info starts to emerge about the suicides that he helped administer.  The cop who protected him now has to pursue him, but is conflicted because she became attached to him.  As a fugitive, the priest tries to take refuge with the local bishop.  The bishop turns out to be corrupt — runs a secret prostitution ring and deals meth (there's a real-life example of a priest doing this in case it seems unrealistic).  The bishop blackmails the priest into becoming part of his little underworld empire.    Eventually, the priest takes over from the bishop and kills him.  The cop who protected him now has to bring him down.      At the same, the murderers who forced the priest into witness protection are looking for him.  They were initially arrested, then let go when the priest fled witness protection.  They want to kill him and eliminate any chance of seeing a trial.  I can give more details about the cop and the murderers, but hopefully those details provide more ""juice"" than the logline did!"
Screenwriting,3dehcv,thehollowman84,2,Wed Jul 15 19:02:09 2015 UTC,"Okay, I see why you had trouble with the logline now! I would say the building bricks are pretty decent, but the problem is with the details I think.  So here's what interests me about that story, the relationship with the cop, and that the priest himself has secrets. I can sense the conflict the priest will have, but I don't feel it yet.  So I would say your logline has to touch the following point - He witnesses a murder. He is protected by police. He forms a close bond with the cop assigned to protect him. And then he is forced to flee as his own secrets come out.   I would also say - he needs to be at the ""forced to flee"" point at the end of the pilot. The end of the breaking bad pilot isn't Walt deciding he wants to sell drugs. No, at the end of the pilot Walt has already (probably) killed two drug dealers. He's already cooked meth. The show is about a man cooking meth, so he's gotta cook meth in the first episode.   If your show is about a priest on the run from multiple people both good and bad, then he needs to be on the run at the end of the first episode. THAT is what your show is about."

I've seen so many partnerships and friendships dissolve because there was no upfront deal between partners. Myself, I had a situation where I was offered a producer title for a project I sold and my partner, who was inexperienced was not offered a producer title. We were to split the script fee 50/50, but with my experience they wanted me to produce. My partner felt that he deserved to be a producer as well. I made the case for him with the studio, but they ultimately said no. I told my partner and he said he'd rather I NOT be a producer on the project so that we would be true equals moving forward. What he didn't understand was that not only did I have experience and he did not, but if they let me produce our movie I would have the opportunity to make the script stay OUR script. If I bowed out of being a producer, who knows what would happen. Fortunately we worked it out, but it was begrudgingly. If I had to do it all over again I would a) Make a contract with my partner and b) Make sure it had provisions for a separation of script and services.

On the original page, FD claimed that the user's files were ""locked for safekeeping"" and implied that if they wanted access to their files, the unauthorized user should pay up.  It appears now that the files were not locked in any way.  The app was flipped to demo/reader mode.  The FDX files could be opened by other software.

A one-man band is a single point of failure for a software company.  There are numerous examples of good products that just died when their developer had a change of interest, a change of life, or even dropped dead themselves.  With a larger company with numerous stakeholders like Final Draft, you know it's going to stick around.  FWIW, I like and use Scrivener for all my development work.

I don't disagree with anything the article says but it really has nothing to do with how litigation works in the real world. Lawsuits aren't filed based on whether you're in the right or wrong, they're filed because somebody didn't like something you did or said. The NFL could absolutely file a lawsuit if they wanted to. Doesn't matter whether they are right, they can go forward. And after filing suit the goal is simply to steamroll over the opposing party until you've broken the fuck out of them. One side always breaks. Anyone who thinks litigation is about right/wrong or justice or what your are/aren't allowed to do is VERY naive. The NFL may not do anything here. That may be because they don't care or because they think this is good publicity or they think a lawsuit will be bad press or they are worried HBO is big enough it can hold its own. But it sure as hell isn't because they can't file a lawsuit. This is America, not Cuba - you can sue over whatever the fuck you want here!"

Screenwriting,3dc12m,Arandmoor,2,Wed Jul 15 04:09:42 2015 UTC,"I worked on a game and the fact that what I submitted had a consistent format and didn't look like a pile of dog shit (like everyone else's) was what got me the job. I just used standard screenplay format.  As the development dragged on, we made some modifications to the format to simplify things in terms of ""missions"" and events. Essentially, it became a task of filling in the blanks of what the character would be doing between voice-overs and what would trigger these voice-overs.  I also used basic .txt files for supplementary materials like emails/documents/memos/journals/notes to be picked up by the player.  The end product ... didn't quite live up to expectations. Since the levels were pre-made before I even joined, and since they were (as far as I know) never properly play-tested, and since going into too much detail confused the producer to the point where any ambiguity would delay things by days (forcing a very simplified mission structure), the whole game feels empty and long and poorly-paced.  That was also in part due to the fact that, out of the 120-odd collectable journals/emails/memos I made, they only put in about 25 total throughout the entire 8-hour game. I was disappointed."

If you're doing an Indie game, they might not care. However, you should look up some Game Design Documents and learn how to write them. It streamlines writing games and helps you with adding to your resume.  When you write for a game, be sure you're writing for that particular genre. You wouldn't want to write an RPG storyline to a game like flappy bird. The example is extreme, but I think it's just important to emphasize the effect that the mechanics relate to the story.   The player will find a way to ignore your story. What's important is placing motivation to the player to advance his/her progression throughout the story/game.  Characters are key. If your mechanics end up stinking, at least have memorable characters.  These are a few from the top of my head."

Screenwriting,3dagx0,TeamDonnelly,3,Tue Jul 14 19:31:53 2015 UTC,"Ok I wouldn't do it as an origin film but rather the team has been split up for years and are older. But no one knows where the Thing is... Kind of like Watchmen...   This kicks off the beginning of the film as the three remaining members (Richards, Johnny and Sue) go on a mission to find Ben (Thing). There is intrigue and mystery to it and one big question lingers: how can someone kidnap Thing? While all of this is going on, we learn that Richards and the rest have had a falling out due to a past, unknown, event.   So this suspicion drives the 1st act where there is an investigation and the 3 use their smarts to find their old partner. They end up at a small town in Colombia. Turns out Thing has been working for a small scientific research group and they are experimenting on time rifts and are about to crack it. We learn that Thing's motives are to actually try and go back in time to stop the very anomaly that make the Four Fantastic. It's an admirable goal and he isn't overtly evil... So there is wonder and revelation and the three must stop The Thing from going in the time rift...   A fight between Thing and the rest occurs, resulting in Thing giving up. When we think the three have succeeded, Thing actually jumps into the time rift and the team must follow.. But we find out they have a certain amount of time before the rift closes...   This is the 2nd act now as we can see the origin of the 4 ( which the studio would love ) and they must prevent Thing from his goal and they can't interfere with the past or a butterfly effect can happen (similar to Back to the Future 2). A sense of urgency is always looming in this sequence as Richards, Johnny and Sue must get Ben back before the rift closes, and on top of that, make sure they don't alter anything.  The three use their powers in this sequence to not be seen by their younger selves as Sue will use her invisibility, Johnny uses his flame as distractions and Richards his elastic mobility to prevent Thing from any fabric of time harm.   Thing is finally prevented by the three through a great character moment as the main experiment is about to occur and they watch as their younger selves go trough the accident that made their lives fantastic. Thing admits defeat and the others watch in wonder...   As this is happening, an assistant from the research group is seen and begins sabotaging the experiment! The older 4 can't do anything as they only have seconds to go back through the Rift, which they do successfully.   So they are back in the present, in Colombia, and Thing accepts this was their fate all along, as they still have the same abilities. Richards, Sue and Johnny are officially reunited with Ben but now the team know about the assistant and the next question lingers: Why did he sabotage the experiment and what happened to him?  Now the Fantastic Four embark on a mission to find this mysterious Assistant and seek answers. They use their intellect and research abilities as they dig through years of Intel on this person. They find out that this person was left in the time rift and has since become a powerful political leader, very Stalin like.  The past conflict of the Four is shed to light and it is learned that Richards was at fault for a civilian's life and the others can't forgive himself.  The 3rd act begins when the Four arrive in the country where The Assistant, now political leader, is headquartered: We learn that this person rules like a Tyrant and the people call him ""Doom"" (again, the studio would like this).   The Four sneak inside a secret facility and use their powers to confront this Doom. They approach him and... Are welcomed by the Tyrant... They are caught off guard and he speaks about his goals of human prosperity and the collectiveness of humanity and that there are necessary things a person must do to achieve greatness for the greater goal.   Again, admirable things but his lens is off. They confront Doom on the past sabotage and ask the simple question: why? We find out that the he believed back then that this world should be rid of Gods and he went back to prevent it.   The catch is since then, he himself has now grown a humanly--and cosmic--distortion (but he is clearly hiding something else). He thinks this would be seen as a threat to this world but now he has the power to shape things into how he would like them to be -- by going into the past via the a Time Rift Tech.   His goal is to go to a time where his powers-- and the Fantastic Four's-- would make them Gods and can rule without restraint. He presents them this choice and only Richard's seems to sympathize with it (as he clearly can't let go the death he was at fault for).   ""You will erase this existence!"" Ben says (showing character growth) ""Good."" Says Doom. So the Four must band together and make sure that Doom doesn't go inside the time rift.   And that's when we find out that Doom can manipulate objects via electricity and is otherworldly powerful, a God indeed it seems.   The Four are taken aback by this and a big fight between them, Doom and his henchman ensues at the secret facility as the Time Rift is powering up. The sounds of the machine booting up can add a lot of drama to this. As the fight goes on, Doom will try to manipulate Richards about how a simple change can fix things and Richards shows a weakness to this. The remaining three will be using their abilities, fighting with the henchman.   Richards's past weighs heavily on him as he is fighting one on one with Doom.   Before Richards and the other three can contain Doom, it's too late as he jumps into the Rift! Luckily there is that specified time constraint and the team follow, knowing they have a chance to stop this.   They appear in the middle of a Coliseum and Doom is being mauled by a Lion! It takes a moment for the Four to realize where they are and are astonished to see they are in the middle of a gladiator battle. The rift is still open as the they run towards Doom, who kills the animal. The crowd take notice and the The Assistant who became a Tyrant will now become a God.   He shoots lighting out of his hands as the people immediately show awe and obedience towards him. ""We are Gods in this world!"" As Doom relishes his power. ""You're just an assistant."" Says Ben. Doom then motions toward the gladiators to attack the Four and a fight ensues.   Doom continues to manipulate Richards and looks to win him over but Richards overcomes Doom's mind game.   ""Changing the past won't change who you are in the present."" Says Richards and this instantly resonates with Sue, Johnny and Ben as they forgive Richards about the accident. This causes the Four to finally band together (again, the studio would like this) to overcome Doom as his plan to alter the past doesn't come to fruition.  They barely get everyone through the rift before it closes and Doom is defeated and put in a high security prison.   After the euphoria of the battle, we see a fun moment where some of the Greek Gods in a book resemble the Fantastic Four and Doom's ability and Johnny makes a Butterfly Effect joke.   The Fantastic Four are then on international news as being back together as the world celebrates seeing their Heroes back again   The End.  After the credits, a prison guard approaches Doom's cell and utters two words to the newly captive inmate ""Doomsday Awaits.""   Doom smirks as the screen cuts to black.

Screenwriting,3dagx0,BTS_1,2,Wed Jul 15 18:35:43 2015 UTC,I'd watch the shit out of this movie.  Disclaimer Edit - BTS1 is my writing partner.
Screenwriting,3dagx0,BTS_1,2,Wed Jul 15 18:47:49 2015 UTC,"We run credits with a montage of the accident, showing Reed, Susan, Johnny and the Thing all learning how to use their powers, fighting crime.  Cut to  Fantastic 4 - Revelations  Three years have passed since Reed, Susan, Johnny and Ben gained their fantastic powers.  The Fantastic 4 have split up as a team over a yet to be explained reason.  Susan and Johnny spend their time globe trotting, yukking it up with the rich of the rich, showing off their powers for amusement.  Ben still fights crime, alone now, at a local level, he easily thwarts a ""heat"" esqe bank robbery in NYC.  Reed along with a team of scientists spends his time obsessively looking for a cure to his ""abnormality"".    This movie will focus around Reed.  He is obsessive and controlling.  He doesn't want fate to control his life, he views his power as something forced on him.  He doesn't want it anymore and believes he can get rid of it.    His team of scientists is personified in the character of Jacob, an amiable man who doesn't believe Reed's powers are inherently a curse but is willing to help cure him, while also researching the mutation itself.    Reed uses blood samples of himself on lab mice.  For a short period of time the rats show the power of elasticity, but without fail they roll over and die.  Reed and Jacob are indifferent to it.  But the lab janitor, Harvey Elder, is shown to show genuine empathy for the poor creatures being sacrificed purely so Reed can escape what is seemingly his destiny.    The first act ends with Ben responding to a 911 call, a school bus somehow got knocked onto its side.  He shows up to the scene but finds the school bus is empty, in fact the entire street is empty.  It is an ambush.    A terrifying roar is heard - Ben turns around and it is a pack of wolf sized lab mice, as terrifying as they are comical.  Oversized incisors and tails as sharp as whips.  And they are ravenous.  They attack Ben who discovers they each have various powers of the other Fantastic 4 (Fire, Invisibility, Elasticity).  Ben is overwhelmed, knocked out and left for dead.    Ben's trip to the ER causes the team to have a quasi reunion.  There can be a bit of a comedic beat while Susan is perpetually fending off messages from various suitors while Ben recounts his tale of being attacked by enormous rodents with fantastical powers.    Reed immediately figures out who the man behind the attack must be.  He leaves his team behind, Susan senses something is wrong, leaving her phone with Johnny who stays bedside with Ben.  Johnny tells Ben about the various models he met in Sweden.    Reed storms into the lab, attacking Jacob who pleas innocence.  Reed doesn't believe him, he throws Jacob against cages of lab mice and test monkeys who erupt in squeals of panic.  Jacob continues to swear innocence, Reed is about to knock him out when suddenly the animals fall silent.  Reed looks over his shoulder to find Harvey Elder approaching him, the animals all look at him as a savior of sorts.    Harvey monologues about how he views Reed as the worst of humanity.  Reed could've been a hero for the world (not just mankind) but instead became obsessed with his own selfishness.  Harvey is flanked by the pack of wolf sized lab mice and slowly an even larger figure comes into view behind Harvey, it is a test monkey, the size of a gorilla, clearly having the blood of the Thing injected into it.  Harvey taps an iron crown on his head, declaring it a device he built which allows him to control the minds of animals.    Fight ensues.  Reed and Jacob attempt to escape, they are racing down lab hallways, pursued by CGI riddled monsters.  They reach a locked door, they turn and brace for death when the door opens behind them.  Susan appears!  She had followed Reed and was trying to get to him the whole time.  Unfortunately Jacob is devoured by the lab mice while Reed and Susan barely escape the lab.  Harvey Elder, now revealed as the Mole Man, slowly approaches the entrance to the lab, he is flanked by an even larger pack of mutant sized rats and gorilla sized monkeys.  He grins feverishly.     Cut to Johnny's luxurious apartment overlooking NYC.  The Thing has recovered to nearly full strength, being part rock has it's advantages.  Reed tells the team the situation.  He accepts responsibility for the situation and humbles himself by asking for his team to help him, one last time, to save NYC.  The team acknowledge that Reed has seen the error of his ways, they put their hands together in a circle, Go Team moment!    Cut to  Times Square, Mole Man's face plays on the screens, he is commanding people to kneel before him as their new overlord.  Dozens of overgrown lab mice and gorillas are indiscriminately attacking civilians.  NYPD cops are getting overwhelmed.  NYC firefighters hose down a gorilla.    The Four show up and begin to save the day.  With their powers combined they are powerful.  Susan distracts a Gorilla from a mother and her child, it pursues her until she goes invisible and the gorilla knocks itself out by running face first into a brick wall.  Johnny burns rats and the Thing starts clobbering some overgrown monkeys.  It is a fun and engaging cgi laden sequence that never takes itself too seriously while still maintaining some level of consequence.    Reed fights his way to the Mole Man, they verbally confront each other while chaos occurs around them.  The Mole Man says mankind must be ruled because if left unchecked they will grow cruel to anything they deem beneath them.  Reed says man must make mistakes to learn to be better, that the Mole Man still has time to learn from this and stop it all.  Mole man refuses, they fight but ultimately Reed wins out by destroying Mole Man's animal mind controlling crown.    The animals immediately stop their aggressive behavior and are corralled into police vans where they are brought back to the lab.  Mole Man is thrown into prison.    The four are back together as a team, they stand looking over NYC as the sun rises.  Cut to black.    Open on a dank cellar of a room, we see dirty, primitive computers and technology.  A corpse lays on a concrete slab.    Off screen lab scientist 1 ""Are you sure you can do this""  Off Screen lab scientist 2 ""Months of research, learning about their powers... their mutations...""

Screenwriting,3dbte2,Alscof,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:31:11 2015 UTC,"Your characters have no goals. That means your story has no drama. That means it's just a bunch of talking. That means it's boring.  You hint at what could be a fun goal for the episode: the regional manager is going to be at the dunk tank. In this world, that could be enough to spark a story that your characters (and therefore your audience) can care about. But then you get sidetracked by getting things down off shelves and more jokes about the idiot customers.  What is Trey going to DO? Could the opportunity to dunk the manager spark a change in him? Could we see him struggle to make a choice between two things he wants badly? Could he do something other than whine about his shitty job?  We get it. The customers are idiots. The coworkers are idiots. But nobody wants to watch ""The Idiot Customer Show"". They want to watch a show about characters they care about, who strive towards goals they can understand. That said, give the idiot customers more identifiable names than ""Customer #1"" ""Customer #2"". Even if it's ""Coke Bottle Glasses Customer"" or ""Brawny Paper Towels Guy"" it gives the reader something to latch onto that's more than a number. By labeling a character with a number, you're telling the reader this person isn't important to the story. If that's the case, why am I reading the scene?   As /u/alscof proved, if you don't make your script an easy read, your reader will just put it down and move on to something else. Dual-dialogue isn't the right way to format the character's internal monologue. It's confusing, distracting, and slows down the read. And you use it way too much, and most of the time, it isn't funny. We get that he's frustrated and hates his job. Boo hoo.  What's he going to do about it?  Same with the ""five seconds earlier/ten seconds earlier/thirty seconds earlier"" slugs. You're better off identifying a fantasy sequence (whether they're animated or otherwise) as a FANTASY SEQUENCE in the slug and then a RESET TO: STORE AISLE - AS BEFORE. Your reader isn't tracking everyone's position second-to-second.  I would suggest a title change: WATCHING PAINT DRY."

Is that important to the story or the growth of her character?  Remember, you don't have a ton of real estate with a logline, so ever word needs to serve a purpose.    As a matter of personal preference, I tend to like loglines that show why the journey is going to be difficult for that character in particular.    Ex: When her brother gets sick, a thalassophobic olympic swimmer must win a race across the English Channel in order to pay for his medical bills.    Kind of a shitty example, but the point is that instead of just giving an unimportant attribute of the main character, you can show that the journey is harder for her because of (in this case) her fear of deep water."
Screenwriting,3d9lip,spicyhamster,2,Tue Jul 14 16:19:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this, your response is getting me to think about a lot of things I've overlooked. It's really helpful.  I chose ""internet addicted"" without thinking too much, but the idea was that she's an avid consumer of media (always on her smartphone kind of person). The alien in the movie's flaw is that it has to eat almost constantly to survive. The goal being to make a statement about the horrors of consumer culture and how it's bad for us.  But, I can see what you're saying. I think I should try and come up with some other ways to build her character around that idea."

Screenwriting,3d9lip,tbone28,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:48:07 2015 UTC,"I like that, especially the ""mysteriously start attacking"" part. It gets the point across without too much detail.

Screenwriting,3d9lip,theproliar,2,Tue Jul 14 17:08:18 2015 UTC,"If the main character has a history of abandoning her younger brother that would really put some tension and give your character something to grow from. Maybe it's a half-brother and the step father raped her so she holds resentment toward her brother because of resemblance and he doesn't know why.   Also, you could have a supporting character , native to the area, that is an expert on wolves that really highlights the weird behavior and give the reader context into how messed up the wolves are acting.   Also...... the aliens could be removing the people from the town because it's over something they have hidden beneath and the protagonist or brother find it. Better yet, if the brother discovers it which leads to the inciting incident. The aliens realize that no one in the town can live with that knowledge.   Sorry, not trying to hijack your idea but it just goes to show how it opens my mind to possibilities which is a sign of a good log line, IMO."

That logline makes as much sense to me as yours does.  You have to tell us the connections in your story. Why an alien monster? Why wolves? What does internet addiction have to do with anything?

There are many helpful ingrendients in being a screenwriter, and you don't have to have them all.  He probably writes great dialog.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  Look at some scripts and movies, and observe where the act breaks occur.  The Act I/Act II break is usually a big shift that changes everything and plunges the Protagonist into a Whole New World or situation.  The Act II/Act III break is usually following all kinds of troubles, and the Protagonist's back is against the wall, and he finally takes some action to take control of the things.  In District 9, the big twist at the end of Act I is Wikus getting sprayed with the black liquid.  he is plummeted into a new situation (Act II) as he starts to get sick.  Act II is about twice as long as Act III.  The first half of Act II is taking Wikus from being ill to being targeted for harvesting for his alien DNA.  The second half is him on the run, making a deal to get healed.  The Act II/Act III break is when Christopher breaks the deal, and won't heal Wicks until he gets back with his army in three years.  Wikus beats Christopher and launches the ship -- this is Wikus taking control.  As you can see, Act II is plenty long in this example.  Look at other movies; you'll see that Act II tends to be longer.  Hope that helps."

He mastered every aspect of painting -- portraits, landscapes, light, composition -- and only then was able to break the rules.  I'm a professional writer in another field and I always hear veteran writers tell younger writers that the ""formulas"" are bullshit. But they're not. They're there so that you can master certain aspects of writing first and then explore and take chances once you've got the fundamentals down.

In any writing (art?) discipline, you must first learn the rules really well before you break them. Again, Picasso didn't fucking start out doing cubism. Dude learned every orthodox method of drawing and painting before he subverted it all.  At this point, I should probably give up.

Screenwriting,3d9pmy,phyloh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:26:38 2015 UTC,"Intro caveat: This is all meant to be constructive in brutal fashion. I've felt this pain before, so I'm not saying anything I haven't heard or wouldn't want to hear.  Main caveat: I am not an expert or professional screenwriter. I am a professional writer in another field, but I lay no claim to any sort of special insight into screenwriting. I've written at least 3-4 really shitty screenplays that I'm far too embarrassed to even share at this point. But they were great learning experiences. I am an amateur screenwriter at best.  That being said (again, I'm no expert and a shitty screenwriter at this point still), I'll start out with some of the good.   There are very few typos/spelling/grammar issues. The script is well formatted and you clearly understand what they should look like.  The writing itself is generally crisp, active. You clearly can write (and that is a compliment -- it's often not the case in amateur scripts). You don't come off as a writing hobbyist who took this up under the mantle of, ""Hey, I like movies, and anyone can write, amirite?"" You have some skill and clearly have worked on your writing. That's like 50% of screenwriting right there. The next 50% is where it gets hard, though.  That being said, this feels like -- not a first script, but a script written early in one's career where you're still grasping the basics, but haven't mastered them.  Here's the bad.  I read 40 pages and nothing happened. So, they move in the opening scene. And then for the next 35 pages or so, literally zero decisions are made and nothing changes. I agreed to read 10 pages, but kept reading because I kept saying to myself, surely something will happen...? Assuming Abdul is the protagonist, he did nothing active or assertive during that entire time. And no one did anything active or assertive to him, either.  Once they arrive, nothing changes through page 40.  Nearly every scene is just people standing around talking, with little action and, from what I could see, no meaningful action. I don't mean explosions and gun battles, but I need something more than people just yapping at each other. The grocery store scene was better in that you had some interesting visuals and some cross-conversations, but that was the only scene involving the adults that didn't feel completely static.  Dialogue is very on the nose. No subtext. I don't get a sense of what the characters' motivations are or what they really want. I don't understand Abdul talking in foreign accents and it could come off as offensive. The kids' dialogue is implausibly sophisticated.  I have no sense of what the overall conflict is from reading those 40 pages, other than, some people have lots of money, while others do not, in a quasi-dystopian/surveillance future. But I don't see an overarching conflict and I haven't had a single dramatic moment up to this point. I read your synopsis after I read the pages, and there isn't enough in the first 40 pages setting up that particular conflict.  I don't get the costume thing. There's no context at all for it.  I also find it implausible that in a dystopian future with such scarcity that someone who deals in comic books and sci fi action figures would become rich during an economic apocalypse. Even if it were plausible, it seems oddly disjointed, along with the accents and weird costumes.  The playground is demented beyond logic. A fabulously wealthy compound has something on a playground that breathes real fire, and a torture room with a pillory used on children? Again, no context. It's illogical. Rich people wouldn't let anything happen to their kids remotely dangerous or scary. Anyone who has dealt with students at wealthy schools knows that little Jimmy is perfect and precious and no harm should ever come to him or we will sue the school into oblivion...  The environmental message is way too on the nose -- to the point it's cloying. Setting up the ""good poor but happy"" working class is cliche and also very on the nose. I'm all for a bit of class warfare (workers of the world unite!), but you've got to be far more subtle than this. It plays somewhat akin to the old trope of the ""noble savage."" I get that later it will be discovered that they're not what they seem, but as of page 40, they're just walking stereotypes that scream out ""THIS MOVIE HAS A MESSAGE.""  I don't feel like there's a logical structure here. Surely by page 40 I should have had a few minor twists and turns, some decisions made, some conflict introduced. I'm not a slave to ""inciting incident, then plot point 1, then midpoint, then..."" but you have to have something early on that sets the tone and then blow it up. Certainly by page 40, I should have felt some sort of reversal or blowing up of things (that's a technical term).  I think my harshest criticism -- and I don't say this lightly or glibly - was that I was bored reading it. The only thing driving me forward was wondering when something would happen.  My advice to you is not to burn this and throw it out. It's not one of those kinds of bad early scripts. I'm not sure you can actually rescue this one, but it's a good one to keep around and re-read in a year or two once you've had your hand at a few more scripts.  If you do have Hollywood contacts, I would advise you to not send them this script. You're likely to only get one shot at it and you don't want their first impression to be, ""ugh, another amateur screenwriter..."" Shelve this one, write the next one.  I get the sense that you guys are getting close... but just not there yet. If this is your first script, bravo, it's better than 99.9% of the first scripts I've ever seen. If it's not, still, this shows that you've got a good solid foundation.  Please take this with a grain of salt and in the spirit of me genuinely wanting to give you honest feedback. Perhaps I can send you guys a draft when I've got one ready and you can return the favor :)"

Screenwriting,3d7t1c,SpyKyle,2,Tue Jul 14 04:36:15 2015 UTC,"I don't spend a whole lot of time on backstory, but I know some people do.  But for the character changing during the film, this is directly related to your plot. If your character isn't changing, that probably means your obstacles and stakes aren't big enough. Just look at Ripley's character in the first Alien movie. No one would say it's a ""character-driven movie"", yet her character changes a lot due to a life-and-death struggle."
Screenwriting,3d7t1c,magelanz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:59:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply! Do you think it is better to start off with a jerk-type character (more room for change, but harder for the audience to like) or a more neutral/good character (easier for audience to like but less room for change)?"
Screenwriting,3d7t1c,neonoirontoast,3,Tue Jul 14 05:03:31 2015 UTC,"depends what the story is about. Or, more specifically, what the story is you want to tell. Is a heist film with a good guy gone bad, or is it a bad guy going good? Relate it back to things like theme if you get stuck. Know what you're trying to say.  Secondly, in terms of audiences 'liking' a jerk character...don't worry about that, just make him interesting. Look at Tony Soprano. He's a piece of shit, but damn if he isn't interesting. That's what audiences respond to.   If you're still concerned about it, use things like humor and self depreciation to make them more relateable, rather than tragic back story. Personally, I would find a hitman character more interesting if he hated who he was and loathed going to work, but was unable to do anything else with his life because that was the only thing he's any good at as oppose to another cliche 'oh my parents died and i had fucked up childhood, so now i can kill people for sport'."
Screenwriting,3d7t1c,Belerion,2,Tue Jul 14 05:31:58 2015 UTC,Change doesn't always have to be for the better.
Screenwriting,3d7t1c,JoniB22,2,Tue Jul 14 18:16:29 2015 UTC,"Personally, as a writer, I always want to KNOW my characters' backstories, and know them fairly well, but of course, not everything gets into the script. It's in my purview as I write, it helps me know how my character will act in certain situations, how they'll respond to things, etc. But I don't necessarily paint it all blatantly on the page.   For example, let's say you have a character who's deathly afraid of dogs. YOU as the writer know why --- something that happened when he was five, or whatever.... But in the story, maybe it's just that he gives wide berth to someone walking a dog, or is skittish and we don't necessarily know why. We assume there's a reason, but we don't need a flashback or anything. At some point, if push comes to shove and it becomes important to the story, he can make a one-off comment or whatever. Or he has to face up to being in close proximity with a dog, face his fear, whatever.   I do think you need to know IF and HOW your character is going to change over the course of the story. i.e. that IS part of the story. If a character is to fulfill some goal, want or need, does that pursuit require him to change in order to do so? You need to know that, and allow the reader and viewer to get to know him pre- and post- and during that change......"

Screenwriting,3d7svz,nikvelimirovic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:34:50 2015 UTC,"Hey!   The whole content was predictable. I saw it from the start where it was going, but maybe that's what you wanted and honestly that's OK. Sometimes you just want to tell an obvious but full of content story. Now, I think you could work some aspects.   First of all, Don. He tells Johnny not to curse, but after a few moments he is the one cursing. You may argue 'yeah that just shows how Johnny can piss him off', but if he's the mob boss, he must be contained, cold and with a lot of self-control, otherwise he wouldn't get to that level. Make him classy, as h you started, don't let him get that low.   The park scene. It was during daylight? How about people there? I imagined people there, but after the shot you don't mention screams, police coming. You must describe the scene. It's not the apartment anymore, I need more information on that.   Following the previous paragraph, what about the gun? Suddenly he's worried about it, but where did he toss it?   Finally, you make a last reference to the cross and Jesus, which made me think: did Johnny think that much on Jesus? That doesn't quite come up during the whole script. Sounds fake, like just something nice and cool to say at the end. Maybe you could emphasise his religious side a bit more, with some quotes from the Bible as he speaks to his boss.   I'm just as a starter as you are, but I thought these aspects would turn it into something better. Keep the work!"
Screenwriting,3d7svz,juauz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:31:13 2015 UTC,"Hi thanks for the feedback, yeah I admit it's predictable. Like I responded to the other responder, this is for my junior project at school and I wanted to keep the story itself simple so I could branch out in terms on cinematography when I produce it. In regards to the Don, thank you so much for this, he's one of the biggest things I had concerns about- I want him to reprimand Johnny but I feel like the cursing helps build his character when Johnny really gets on his nerves later on. The park scene, I admit is underdeveloped, thank you for the feedback there I'll be sure to fix that. The gun, I may not have made clear, he dumps in a trashcan right next to the bench where he shot Dick. I like the idea of screams and police to add urgency to him dumping the gun in such an obvious place.   On the last point, I agree about the Jesus comment. I want him and the Don to be very religious people. I'll be sure to add in more religious. Maybe the Don references a Biblical story as an analogy for Johnny's situation?"
Screenwriting,3d7svz,JoniB22,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:32:05 2015 UTC,"Hi there. So I admit I didn't read the whole thing. You lost me pretty quick.... Far, far too many camera directions for my taste. I don't want to read about pans, and shots and I don't care to see the word ""camera"" unless it's actually part of the narrative/action. But that's me. And I'm iffy about V.O. narration ---- if done well, I can tolerate it. But my suggestion is this: give us something engaging to SEE while being subjected to that V.O. What you're giving us is a grimy apartment. Not enough to endure for that long. Show us the 'hood, show us some people, give us a sense of the bigger atmosphere and the time period, before honing in on one guy's ratty digs.   Always be thinking about what your audience is seeing. So like you basically have 2 guys sitting at a table for four minutes. I don't care if dialogue is riveting (which this is not, sorry), but that's boring to watch. You may want to think about interweaving action from later, from post-chat, in with the live chat itself. So .... what does Johnny do after this conversation....... see some of that and have bits of the chat in V.O. over the top of it, then you can return to the scene to finish it out live. Just a thought."

Screenwriting,3d8ihx,Spurtini,2,Tue Jul 14 09:42:56 2015 UTC,"The visa you're looking at is an O1 visa - though you need to demonstrate that you're an artist of significant talent before you get it. Also it can end up costing close to $5000 - $7000 USD if you apply via an immigration lawyer (which is recommended).  But ultimately you have to prove to your interviewer that you belong here because you're the next Spielberg/whatever. Which, for most people, is pretty difficult. Also it means that you can only LEGALLY work in that one field - which would be screenwriting.   America is also full of shitty costs. As a foreigner with no credit score you'll have to put deposits on EVERYTHING (sometimes up to paying six months rent in advance) and the only credit card you'll be able to get is one with a two-hundred dollar limit. Plus there is an inordinate amount of bullshit you have to deal with moving out here. There is red tape everywhere and you'll lose days waiting to submit forms.  Unless you're rich or already successful, you should probably just stay in the UK. The UK is making great films and television at the moment so unless you have a reason to move out here there is pretty much 0 point as a foreigner. Come for a holiday and go to film festivals or something (Austin is always great) but I wouldn't bother moving until you're ready unless you want to blow a good $10,000."

I took it as a challenge, to see if I could use this as motivation to produce a full script under a set deadline.  I thought that maybe I would spend the first week writing out the outline and formulating my ideas.  Then rush the actual teleplay the next week before the deadline.  Instead, I was able to complete the outline, rough draft and the polished final draft in 4 days.  I was amazed.  And despite it being the fastest I ever completed a script, I felt it was the best script I have written yet.  With the time I had left over, and the mental focus I still had allocated for another week and a half of work, I went ahead and tried to write a second script (the workshop accepted up to two scripts).  And I finished the second script in 6 days.  In the end, I didn't just submit one unpolished script as I originally thought, but two scripts that were even beyond the abilities I knew I had.  I still haven't heard back from the workshop (they said they will be notifying applicants in August/September).  But just entering the workshop has given me the confidence to really focus on my writing.  I proved to myself that I could do it.  I really could work under the pressure and set timetable of writing for TV."

Screenwriting,3d7e2z,er1339,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:31:02 2015 UTC,"Quick question --- so have you written a draft of a script? Is this logline the essence of that story? What's the core --- is it him vying for the scholarship? Or the family drama? Or that decision about whether to leave or not? Or the personal demons? I imagine the story encompasses everything, but hitting on that KEY element, goal, need, want, whatever --- that'll help with culling the logline.   To be fair, I find writing loglines far more excruciating than writing a full script!! Boiling things down is tough.  Have you posted any part of your script here on Reddit for feedback? Maybe if peeps read some pages, they can help you hone in on what it's all about ... succinctly. Right now, just feels to me you've got ""too much"" and yet ""not THE thing"" in this current logline. Sorry, I know that may not make much sense........."

Not in the sense that they were bad, because they were, but I expected nothing else. I mean they didn't turn out right in the sense that they weren't really telling the story I set out to tell. So I was hoping that maybe some fresh eyes on the logline could help me figure out where I'm going wrong!  I'm getting ready to tackle this script again, from scratch. When I finish a second draft, I'll most likely be posting it here!"
Screenwriting,3d7e2z,tpounds0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:36:23 2015 UTC,"Before any of this.   An idea I've been grappling with and writing and rewriting for a few years now:   I hope this means you have worked on other scripts and keep coming back to this specific idea. If not, FINISH ANOTHER SCRIPT'S FIRST DRAFT BETWEEN NOW AND SEPTEMBER 31ST!!!  Writer with one idea are not writers, put this on the backburner for a bit.  Now on to the advice:    First you mention the family twice, which is part of the reason your logline comes off a bit wordy.  I wonder what family drama or personal demons he has. Being specific draws the readers attention. Generic makes them think your writing will be generic. 100%.   An arrogant swimmer endures family drama and personal demons as he attempts to win a scholarship that will allow him to go away to college next year, but will require him to leave his younger sister behind in their mother's unreliable care.   Main character - Arrogant swimmer.  Goal - Get a scholarship and leave family  Conflict- Fear for his younger sister being in mom's care.  So is it about a guy who learns the importance of family and forgoes the scholarship to take care of sister and mother at the end?  OR  A guy who learns that just because parents make mistake doesnt mean they will ruin their kids life forever. and gets the freedom to leave his sister in his mother's care.  Again, if you get more specific towards the theme in the logline, it will interest more readers.  Usually I try to suggest a clearer logline, but there are so little specifics in this one. I'd try:   A [adjective that gives us his personal demons] swimmer works towards an ivy league scholarship while he begins to fear for his sister's care in his mother's house.   or   A [adjective that gives us his personal demons] swimmer cares for his sister because of their mother's flightiness, when he gets a shot at an out of state scholarship.   You can see the first suggest's his character changes from a person who wants nothing to do with his family,  to someone who forgoes the scholarship and chooses himself at the end.  The second shows a character stuck helping his family ahead of himself, and by the end of the movie will have changed to the point where he can go off to college fulfilled."
Screenwriting,3d7e2z,tbone28,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:24:31 2015 UTC,"Wow dude this is awesome, thank you so much!  First, yes, I'm almost done my first run through of a completely different script, and I've written a a pilot and two TV specs, as well. But this is the first idea I ever came up with on my own that was actually any good, and my passion for it has never dissipated.   That said, I've never been able to finish it. Largely because of the problem you immediately recognized: what is this guy's arc?  I've gone through outlines and partial drafts where he decides to give up on his own dreams--or at least put them on hold--to stay home and care for his family. I've also had drafts where he accepts his mother's flaws and decides to trust her, realizing that he has to take the chance and leave if he doesn't want to have the same life as her.  The ending that I think is ""best"" is for him to stay at home to help his mother and take care of his sister. His character arc sort of ends with him realizing that his sister is more important to him than anything else, but it also ends with him forgiving and understanding his mother for her flaws.  The personal demons angle is kind of the B-story, which was originally the A-story until I realized how much more interesting the family-conflict angle was. As you can guess from the title, he works as a lifeguard, and early on in the script (probably end of Act 1), he fails to save a little boy (his sister's age, of course) from drowning. This destroys his confidence, gives him panic attacks when he tries to swim, and forces him to re-evaluate his perspective on pretty much everything.  The plot is driven pretty solidly by this swim competition that he needs to qualify for and then win, or else he'll lose his scholarship to his dream school. A very straightforward chain of events with a fixed timeline. But the story is about him accepting his own imperfections, and by doing so, accepting his mother's imperfections. That allows him to stay home without it being a sad ending. I'm going for bittersweet, not sad."
Screenwriting,3d7e2z,tbone28,-2,Tue Jul 14 20:33:00 2015 UTC,No this is great.   A talented swimmer can see his path to success and the ruin of his younger sister at the hands of their mother. He has to make a choice between his career or his sister.   This pulls the heart strings doesn't it? How many people have had to make this choice. Now this is an interesting premise with some great conflict. How successful this story is will be based on how well you can show him trying to go for both. Does he do both horribly? Does one suffer for the other.   Here is where you need to put your spin on it.   Edit: I got it! Have him try and get into a relationship with a girl for the sole purpose of her taking care of his sister. He pretends to like her but obviously doesn't. He only wants to make sure his sister is taken care of so he can pursue his dreams. See the flaw. He is really selfish. And he is playing with a girls heart for his own gains.

Screenwriting,3d7vrj,HashtagBlessd,3,Tue Jul 14 05:03:42 2015 UTC,I'll just say based on page length. The sweet spot according to most web video content producers is over 2 minutes and under 5. After a 5< minute long video is just not gonna get the spread that a 5 minute or under video could.   So I would make the suggestion of turning this into two episodes.  Now to read it and give you more specific notes.
Screenwriting,3d7vrj,tpounds0,3,Tue Jul 14 05:57:23 2015 UTC,"Specific.   DINO SOUR (71-75 million year old Dinosaur) tries to   Not the funniest reader specific joke. I'd actually love some description of what Dino looks like from a producing staindpoint. Is this a guy in a barney outfit like a Dinosaur Wilfred? Is this supposed to be an actual dinosaur, and the webseries is CGI or animated? If so, what species of dinosaur?   wearing what appears to be a bra made of human nipples.   Your entire arc of this episode was Dino getting the urge to attack the audience of Jurassic World, after being called a wimpy dinosaur for not attacking humans. Your cold open undermines that if you start with him wearing a Bra made of human nipples.  Also bra implies that Dino is female, which I thought made sense as Dino is supposed to be a social justice warrior against dinosaur prejudice. But then you use male pronouns. Why not just make Dino a lady.   HUGH  Then go protest that shit, man. You need to be a man, I mean, dinosaur of action. You're all talk and no ferocious dino bite.   Have someone read out the script with you. That ""I mean"" is kind of superfluous, especially for a younger early 20s male.   HUGH(cont'd)  Mmmmmm. I just realized that this is kind of like I'm eating little cooked baby you's.   I don't like the format your program picked where they add a cont'd after ever character speaking after an action line. It's just annoying and the actors will get it.  Also, this was a little boring a punchline. Humor is about surprise, and since you are already have murder and nipples, don't be afraid to go darker in dialogue.   END OF ACT ONE   Yeah, webseries do not need acts. They should be considered closer to sketches. Either trim this down or turn it into a 22 minute pilot for tv.  There was also NO CONFLICT in that scene. Just exposition.   He holds a sign that has a picture of the T. Rex from Jurassic Park next to a picture of Dino with the caption ""Healthy At Any Size"".   I feel like people will get the joke without the Dinosaurs on the actual sign. And get more dinosaur specific with what the sign says. Instead of it being a size issue, why not make it about the feathers?   DINO( chanting)  Spread knowledge, not hate! Spread knowledge, not hate!   Again, a dinosaur specific chant will get more laughs.  Finally some conflict on page five. The first half.   DINO (to the projectionist)  Did they learn nothing?   This line makes no sense. Dino stopped the movie, what could the audience learn?  The callback of wearing human skin just doesn't come off strong. It feel like a weird obsession of the writer.   DINO  Don't you understand? These so called ""dinosaurs"" are not real. They're CGI constructs that put a lot of pressure on real dinosaurs. These are unachievable Hollywood standards!   Earlier Dino described them as ""Those dinosaurs are genetically modified to look that way!"" are they actually genetically modified in the universe of the webseries, or are they CGI? Pick one."
Screenwriting,3d6y36,j_tl,3,Tue Jul 14 00:23:28 2015 UTC,"You know what, I really enjoyed this. A solid 7/10. And I'm a pretty huge Brooklyn Nine-Nine fan.  Characterisation of Boyle and Rosa was absolutely spot on - Boyle pulling pigtails a massive highlight, not only because it was funny but also the reaction at the end (Rosa, why do I keep pulling people's hair) was a vintage Boyle line.   Peralta and Holt also had plenty of good moments. I really liked a lot of the jokes - you've done really well to capture that exact Brooklyn Nine-Nine kind of humour.   Amy was a bit of a disappointment though. There were flashes of the uptight, goody two shoes Santiago that I know and love, but not enough. Too much of the time I felt like she was watered down, particularly when interacting with Jake. I would work on finding her voice a bit more, cause it will really add some conflict and dramatic irony to those scenes.   Oh, btw, Peralta's line about 'I believe they call that irony' was laugh out loud funny. Again, I really liked this ep as a whole. The humor really was great.  Plot-wise, A plot with Boyle and Rosa was structurally the strongest element and worked well in terms of character and resolving itself at the end. Amy and Jake's B plot should work well in theory but, as I mentioned above, the characters need to be more defined. There's plenty of comedy in the idea though, the execution just needs fine tuning. The weakest plot line by far was Holt's. It started off well, but then it disappears completely only to come back with Holt at home talking to Kevin for, as far as the reader can tell, no real reason in particular at all. And then he's handing out compliments, which was only so-so in effectiveness. I can see what you're going for, but it needs more work. The flow of the storyline, or the arc, needs to be more consistent and gradual. At the moment it smacks of 'oh shit, Holt's in this episode too'.  Finally, I would add more Gina if possible and where the hell was the Ebony Falcon (Terry)?"
Screenwriting,3d6y36,neonoirontoast,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:07:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed feedback, much appreciated.  I agree with your critiques.  Earlier drafts had larger roles for Terry and Gina, but the page count was passing 40 and their parts were easiest to cut.  I definitely have new appreciation for how the show's writers are able to utilize the entire cast each episode.  Holt's storyline gets lighter in the second and third acts for sure - again, a length issue.  I could probably re-work the second act to make it less bar-scene heavy.  I hadn't thought about Amy's characterization being an issue but I see what you're saying.  She's actually a complex character to write for - she can be passive yet persistent, straight laced yet goofy, all sort of at the same time.  Again, thanks for the feedback!"

Setting the briefcase he’s carrying on the near by bed opens it to reveal a safe cracking auto dialer and laptop, which he proceeds to set up, then waits for the system to unlock the safe.  Suddenly April’s voice alerts him through the ear piece, that the target is in the lobby and on his way up.   Kayden remains stoic, staring at flashing sequence of numbers in front of him.

I'm sure you can understand that I'm just a little bit apprehensive about sending my script of to an email I don't know. Is there a website you can link me to?  Thanks."
Screenwriting,3d5oiw,SmartAlice,2,Tue Jul 14 10:29:17 2015 UTC,"You don’t send the script, you send an inquiry email first and when they respond, all their contact info will be in the email and you can google the company and make sure they are legit.  Don’t send unregistered materials.  Spend the money and register it with WGAW (Writers Guild of America West).  The legal stuff can be tricky, however as long as it’s registered, someone trying to take your work won’t have a pot to piss in.  Log lines are a bit hard to write, but with practice you can get really good at it.  I wrote a log line for you to send, that describes in two sentences what the script is about – learning to write log lines was part of a writing class I took.  ***Hi, my name is (fill in your name) and I'm a writer.  I just finished a short script that could easily be turned into a feature and meets the requirements in your post.  LOGLINE:  Nicky and Janice, a young professional couple return to  Danny’s Diner, always sitting at their favorite table, during key moments in time as their seemingly simple relationship unfolds.  As the years pass they are oblivious to the crumbling world around them or it’s impending demise.  Looking forward to hearing from you.  Best regards, (fill in your name here)***  I've never submitted anything to websites, I usually call the production companies directly to see what they are looking for, that's how I got my current hook up.  And I look through CL, respond to post and wait and see.  I've also been writing and posting articles on Linked In to gain more visibility because a lot of people in the entertainment industry are that site.  You have to have a game plan on how to market yourself and get your work out there.  Since your script is set in one location, with minimal actors, I would suggest getting a few friends together and just shoot it, edit it, just so you can see how the finish product will look.  I say this because I've worked on a lot of low budget to no budget films, where a first time director wanted to re-shoot stuff after production wrapped up, because he hadn't developed a ""feel"" for making films.  To develop that ""feel"" a person has to ""practice"" making films.  Today's technology allows a person to capture moving images very cheaply.  It doesn't matter if you shoot it on your iPhone and your first efforts doesn't look great, then you shoot it again maybe with a different cast.  Call it ""your proto sample of your film"".  Ron Howard was making home movies as a child, so he ""practiced"" making films before he became big.  I work in the apparel industry, when we design a garment, we revise and redo the sample a few times before final approval.  I shot a short film and after editing you'd never know I used a cheap camera."

Much thanks."
Screenwriting,3d5oiw,SmartAlice,2,Tue Jul 14 13:47:21 2015 UTC,"I googled ""how to register a script in the UK"" and found this from the Film Network:  How do I Copyright my Script/Idea?   If you've written a script, or had a great idea, one of the first questions you may ask is “how do I protect this idea or script?” The quick answer is that you can't copyright an idea but you can copyright a script or a film. Intellectual Property is complicated but don't panic or worry too much. You can find out the basics about how to protect your work on the UK Intellectual Property Office (formerly known as the UK Patent Office) website: www.ipo.gov.uk/copy  Copyright occurs automatically when a script is created but proving it was written before another similar work can sometimes be difficult. You can email or post the script back to yourself to show the date it was created or alternatively there are a number of script registration services available.  In addition to copyrighting the script, you can copyright other elements of the film, such as character design, art design and images. To show others, in the most simple way, that you have copyright in a work, you can add a © to the work along with your name and the date. You may also choose to register your copyright with a copyright registration service such as the UK Copyright Service or The Script Factory Script Registration Service. This is not essential, and may not be appropriate in many cases, but it could serve to protect you in the event of a copyright dispute. ****  Even though you're new at this: the key thing in to register all your finished material before sending it out.  Production companies won't touch unregistered material.  And if a company ask you to intern, do not give them any of your work without an agreement that you will be compensated.  When my sister first started out in the music business, she was already working with different artist, managing and representing them.  Then a corporate company offered her a job, she started working for them and they wanted one of the artist she'd been representing and tried to say that: since she worked for them, anything she developed belonged to them.  She went to court, won her case and they paid her a hefty fee to sign him on as one of theirs."

So, we're up to the inciting incident.  He gets a ""call to adventure"" in the form of these people he finds. He resists, he succumbs for some reason related to the inciting incident.

Extricate himself from the situation with the bad guys who are now blackmailing him because he has something to protect?    For the logline, there needs to be something of the story of the struggle, the line he follows.

Screenwriting,3d5eob,wrytagain,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:07:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this feedback! Super helpful. Originally I had his call to action be his visit to the deep web where he discovers counterfeit money, drug trade, stolen goods for sale, etc. on a non-indexed portion of the Internet. He comes across an ad requesting an arsonist willing to burn down a religious structure for money. However, this seems a bit anticlimactic and not motivating enough. I agree that something more grand needs to happen to send him to the deep web.  Before he gets involved with arson for hire we get to know about his tendencies to set fire and become mesmerized by it. However, he never burns down large buildings or sets off bombs like he will once the drama intensifies. So while he is a family man, he does have secrets. Nobody would suspect him of having this dangerous hobby. This is a point I want to get across. No matter how much we feel that we know someone, we will never truly know an individual because everyone is hiding something.  Most of the drama will be his involvement with these gangs/terrorist groups/criminals. Blackmail will be involved. He is trying to hide this from his family. He is trying to evade police. He is trying to hold onto his morals and not harm anyone in the process. However, part of his character arc will be this filter disintegrating as he becomes more and more ruthless and consumed."

""We had the bare bones of a script and then there was a writers’ strike and there was nothing we could do. We couldn’t employ a writer to finish it. I say to myself, 'Never again,' but who knows? There was me trying to rewrite scenes – and a writer I am not.’""  Here's a transcript, which isn't ideal but maybe it will help."

Screenwriting,3d4t5y,poseymund,4,Mon Jul 13 15:05:22 2015 UTC,"I thought it had some good ideas but over-reached. The John Conner as a Terminator thing was not needed. It also touched on a real simple idea that could explain why Judgement Day is inevitable rather than explaining it through another software release like T3(which was awful).   Arnold's Pops character mentions that, according to some quantum theorists or some such, if something exists in the future and you go back in time, no matter what occurs, if that thing still exists in the future than something has to happen in the past to fix it. Events have to transpire that will create that thing that thing or event. So killing Dyson and destroying Cyberdyne would still fail if something from the future still existed in the past. Which they briefly touch on in T2 when they destroy Cyberdyne's cyborg parts and Uncle Bob the Terminator kills itself.  So, theoretically, Skynet's first order of business would be to send a Terminator back with one simple mission: survive. As long as it survives, when you get to the year 20-whatever, events will transpire to make sure the thing exists to be sent back. And the events that transpire will change since Sarah and Co. destroy Cyberdyne but Skynet will be inevitable as long as something from Skynet's present exists in the past.  Which is where I thought this flick was going originally. Instead, they made John Conner as Terminator and added way too much human behavior by Skynet and machines. Skynet and the Terminators were good villains because they were logical and ruthless. They didn't do shit like the T-1000 in this movie where it makes showy moves and such.   To me, the better plot line would have been Sarah and Reese trying to figure out/find the Terminator that is sent back to survive. Flipping the paradigm with Sarah Conner hunting a Terminator."

Screenwriting,3d57xz,wrytagain,4,Mon Jul 13 17:01:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's stupid.   I don't want to say that this never happens, although, honestly, it is extremely rare. A couple of issues:  First, ideas are not protectable. If you have a great concept for a movie, I can write something form the same concept. There's nothing you can do about it. The only thing protectable is the specific expression of that idea in fixed form.   However, you have a huge leg up. Let's say you share your idea, and I love it and decide to steal it. Well, jeez, you've already written your script! It would take me several months to get a solid draft together, and so I'd be, at best, second to market with the idea. Because of this, it can make sense to not share ideas before you've written the script, but once you've written the script, it's not an issue.   Third, again, you can prove access, if I actually steal anything, it's a pretty open-and-shut case. And if they sold it, they'd be hung out to dry: the studio makes you sign something when you sell it to them which says that, if it's not yours and you acted in bad faith, then you're on the hook for all the defense costs personally.   Fourth, people will the skills to take your idea and turn it into a professional-quality script in a reasonable time frame have plenty of their own ideas. Even if they did take your idea, the finished product would probably be so different from yours that you wouldn't recognize it.   Fifth, your idea probably isn't as original as you think it is. There probably multiple projects out there with ballpark-similar loglines.   Sixth, you can't have a career without sharing your scripts, so you're going to have to bite the bullet and share them sooner or later.  Seventh, if you're at the point where you're sending it to strangers for feedback, honestly, the odds that you have something of sellable quality are so low as to be nonexistent. What you gain from gathering reactions is much more valuable than what you lose from the odds of something stealing something that has no real value anyway.   When you reach that ""on the cusp"" point, that equation perhaps changes. But at that point I doubt you're soliciting feedback from strangers."

""Oh, this project got difficult"" - and they all get difficult sometimes - ""So I'll work on something else until I get inspired.""  One thing you need to learn is how to solve a difficult problem. You won't always have the luxury of switching to something else and hoping the muse strikes.   So try to be self-aware enough to know why you're choosing to work on something else. If you're running away from the hard work, stop. Don't let yourself do that. Sitting with a difficult scene, and LETTING it be difficult, not rushing it, not grabbing the first answer that at least kinda works, is a big part of making great work.

This helps create perespective. it might be a great idea but you might have learned something about yourself or the idea that forces you to consider whether to venture writing it. For example, last night I was watching an alien b-movie and I thought "" I could do this better. This movie is sending a message about the war in the middle east but the dialogue is atrocious. If I were to do this..."". So after fleshing out an idea, I put it away because pursuing it would take away my concentration from the first project.

Screenwriting,3d19yr,Lookout3,5,Sun Jul 12 19:51:47 2015 UTC,I wouldn't have the career I have without the ability to juggle multiple projects at varying stages all at once. It's a VERY valuable skill.
Screenwriting,3d19yr,8bit_Llama,5,Sun Jul 12 21:15:09 2015 UTC,"Eventually, most screenwriters have to work on multiple projects at once, at least in the outlining / planning stage.  It's a hard skill, but you're going to have to be able to rewrite one project while outlining a new one, potentially while writing another's first draft.  It's really hard, but it's a good skill to work on.  That being said, I have a really hard time actually writing more than one thing at once, so even if I'm outlining a bunch and rewriting etc, when it comes time to do a full draft I set a weekend or week aside so that's my only focus.  Even when I'm just outlining / working on treatments etc, I tend to compartmentalize so I can focus on each one fully for a set amount of time, then try and switch gears as fast as possible to get rolling on the next.  So the advice I suppose is work on as much as you can in a macro sense, but try and keep your attention focused only on whatever you're working on (in a micro sense) instead of split between everything.  If you're going to take an afternoon to finish up an outline, don't work on any other project until you're done with that outline.  Having the bandwidth to really focus on multiple things and have them turn out well is probably one of the hardest things about actually working in this career, in my opinion."

For example, the whole dad/wesley subplot: supposed to mirror the ""control"" theme?  Like humanity just needs the option to fly off to India if Pallas is being too controlling? But since Pallas is all powerful, humanity doesn't have that option and that's the real crime?  Either make it more integral to the plot in some way or lose it.  I don't think you're going to generate much interest with the cliched old ""Humans must control their own fate, even if they end up destroying themselves""  If you're going to tell a singularity story, there are so many other interesting possible stories to tell. And this is kind of a low level pseudo-Luddite argument that even the original Luddites would discard. Like, who are you mad at for the A-bomb?  The scientists who investigated reality? Reality? For allowing A-bombs?  Or maybe it was just hawkish political and military leaders and most importantly the populace who enabled them that are to blame?  Plus a lot of your speculative tech stuff seems incomplete or like a set up with no pay off.  Pallas is wetware?  Or she's not?  She's software that controls firmware and other software?

In the first draft, Aaron Sorkin wrote that Paul Young - Love Of The Common People should be playing. Try to imagine that scene of him running home after being dumped with http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVmjKHkgxis playing on top. It would have ruined the movie.   In the first couple of drafts of Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, Charlie Kaufman wrote specific songs into the scene where Joel's in Clem's apartment for the first time. The strange choices were there to help flesh out the Clementine's character. They didn't make the movie but they helped guide the sound direction.

If you're writing a spec script it's probably best to leave out the music choices.   I really don't like this talking point.

Screenwriting,3d0zcu,wrensalert,6,Sun Jul 12 16:48:10 2015 UTC,"No, a script doctor works on content, not spelling and grammar.   A good trick is to print out your script and read it backwards. Then you're not focusing on the story or characters or anything like that, just finding errors."

Screenwriting,3d0zcu,theproliar,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:55:33 2015 UTC,This is the best advice I ever got on how to proofread. It's a little tedious but we'll worth the effort when you're done and your script is perfect.
Screenwriting,3d0zcu,2drums1cymbal,2,Sun Jul 12 20:24:08 2015 UTC,"You're looking for a proofreader or an editor.   You can do a lot of this yourself. A couple of techniques:  First, I second the ""reading it aloud"" idea. DO NOT MUMBLE. Articulate each word clearly. When you find yourself having trouble with that, take a break. Mumbling = skimming. Skimming = reading what you think you wrote, rather than what you actually wrote.   Second, it helps to go backwards. Paragraph by paragraph, or page-by-page. This breaks the narrative flow, which can cause you to skip forward. Start with the last paragraph. Then the second to last, etc.  Third, PRINT IT OUT. I do both of the above on a hard copy. This is one of those things that people are incredibly resistant to until they do it, and they realize they're catching a bunch of errors they otherwise would have missed. It will make a difference."

Hope that's okay:  I try to think of the movie in chunks instead of as a whole. It can be difficult to manage a whole story in your head at once.  After thinking about the movie for some time; writing some stuff about the characters, some story beats, I write down short descriptions of scenes or story beats, ideas for turning points, pieces of dialogue you'd like to be in the movie. Just write as many as you can think of. Then maybe come up with your turning points. First turning point, midpoint, and the second turning point which leads into act three.  And think about your ending. You should be doing this all the way through the process. And maybe divide some time to only think about the ending.  I use sequencing to structure most of what I write for the screen. Then divide your movie into eight sequences, each between 8-15 minutes long.  Put in what you thought of before, and expand. Put in the beats. About 10-12 beats in each sequence.  Then you expand into more descriptions of scenes, maybe add in some dialogue if you think of any.  This is your story. Look at it. Tell it to yourself. Tell it to other people. Does it work? Is it good? Is it fun? Exciting? Touching? Probably not. Maybe? Rewrite. Rewrite. Rewrite. Rework all or some of the steps. Rewrite.

They're often the earliest one's you'll face in your journey. Choosing an idea is like choosing which pudding cup to devour. There's very little substance and it's easy. You can't get it wrong. It comes down to personal preference. It would be a tremendous disservice to you and all that you can become to tell you ""this"" or ""that"" is best.  So what do you have to work with? Ideas. What idea should you work on? The one that grabs you and never lets go. The one that inspires you to pull it from the ether and shape it on the page. The one makes you feel anger, sadness, or joy. You should write the one that whispers to you in your waking moments. The one that never stops telling you of all the things it can be. Write the one that makes you need to work."

Hell, I'm seventy pages and an overly-winded outline into my current project and I don't have a fucking clue what my logline would be right now.

Screenwriting,3cwwxc,ChinaskiBlur,4,Mon Jul 13 15:35:28 2015 UTC,"100% disagree.  The logline is just the quick pitch of your story.  If you can't sum up succinctly why your story should be interesting to the people who might buy it, then it's going to hurt you later on and you'll find yourself floundering.  This is actually a new thing I've realized -- I used to put off loglines to the end, and as a result ended up with a few specs that didn't have a clean enough concept.  I don't think there's anything wrong with tweaking your logline while you're outlining and figuring stuff out, but in my experience, until I can pitch it to my manager in one sentence and get him excited, I don't have a real idea yet that even warrants the time to write the script.  Edit:  That being said, don't spend all your time on the logline once you have it nailed down.  It's not in the wording, it's in the idea.  When (inciting incident), a (protagonist) must (objective), or else (stakes).  Just plug it in and see if it's interesting.  You can always tweak the shit out of it later after you've written the script.  I still tweak loglines for a script I wrote three years ago."
Screenwriting,3cwwxc,8bit_Llama,5,Sat Jul 11 17:18:45 2015 UTC,Wait... your scripts didn't have a clean enough concept because of your logline or lack thereof? You had a different problem--it had nothing to do with loglines. I can assure you of this.
Screenwriting,3cwwxc,ChinaskiBlur,2,Sat Jul 11 17:33:32 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I didn't have a clean enough concept.  Which I would have known if I'd tried to put it in a logline and seen it needed something else.
Screenwriting,3cwwxc,8bit_Llama,2,Sat Jul 11 17:39:39 2015 UTC,"You're confusing loglines with outlines. Outlining will reveal your weaknesses. Everytime. Once you've written a screenplay you have something far more valuable than a logline. You have a full screenplay that took hundreds of hours to accomplish and with which you can develop into something great.  Stories take time, if one of your screenplays isn't clear enough it probably just needs more work. I always lean on Hemingway's advice here, it gets me through the early drafts.   ""The first draft of anything is shit."" -Earnest Hemingway   Of course he lied a little here because it's probably the 2nd, 3rd, and maybe even the 4th that's true of this as well. But in the end, after many drafts, I usually end up with something I'm proud of."
Screenwriting,3cwwxc,ChinaskiBlur,3,Sat Jul 11 18:23:47 2015 UTC,"I actually don't totally agree.  I think there's something about boiling the whole outline down into a clear idea that can make it obvious you're missing a hook, or that it's overly complicated.  For me, spending a little bit of time making sure the idea works as a logline helps test the idea itself.  Sometimes I think it's easy to get bogged down in the forest once you're in outlines and drafts and treatments.  Ultimately I think we're disagreeing around the point we agree with.  I don't think you should spend very long on your logline and should hurry up and get to writing the script.  But for me, I think making sure it works as a logline is a good first step to make sure it's working overall."

In a Hollywood pitch, the writers/producers pitch to the studio and include the logline. The point of the logline is condense the story to one or two sentences. Then you expand. But, you want that logline as a clear proof of concept before you move forward. 99% of the time the script isn't written yet.  You can do whatever you please if you are writing spec."
Screenwriting,3cwwxc,ChinaskiBlur,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:33:53 2015 UTC,"Loglines are not proof of concept. Two sentences of anything can't (except in very rare instances) convince a studio to greenlight a script unless you're a very successful writer or have Kevin Huvane repping you. Most ""well established"" writers now create full presentations to prove concepts that well exceed a two-sentence logline. They often include a sizzle/mock up reel, a one-page synopsis and a breakdown of attachments such as a director or actor.   I agree that loglines are written first. I think they're essential when starting a screenplay. And they evolve as the script evolves.  I have heard of one logline that closed a huge budget. It went something like this:   It's Romeo & Juliet on the Titanic. -James Cameron   And even in this example Cameron wrote a scriptment for the pitch but he didn't need it because, although the studio wasn't thrilled with the idea of a 3-hour epic love story, they wanted a long term relationship with Cameron so they greenlit the pitch (at a much lower budget than $200MM mind you)."
Screenwriting,3cwwxc,NameIWontRegret,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:16:42 2015 UTC,"You're correct. Maybe my phrasing was poor.

Screenwriting,3cwwxc,ChinaskiBlur,0,Sat Jul 11 20:51:44 2015 UTC,Yeah cool. Loglines can be a helpful element but I don't recommend that writers spend large amounts of time working on them when that time can be spent building an extensive and extremely helpful outline.
Screenwriting,3cwwxc,ChinaskiBlur,3,Sat Jul 11 21:31:09 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you, OP. The story is all that matters. Forget about selling your script, forget about getting an agent, forget about winning a fucking Oscar... write the script, re-write it over and over again until it's the best possible script you can produce, then create and/or tweak your logline and other ""marketing"" materials.   Writers must know the beginning, middle and end of their story (well some might disagree and they'd be right if that's their style) and from those three points we can build an initial logline which can serve as mini-outline. But loglines, no matter how refined and beautiful, are not a substitute for screenplays -- anyone who is not an elite ""A"" list writer or incredibly connected is unlikely to sell a logline to anyone without a screenplay.  I know you don't mean to suggest that people don't post their loglines for critique like some here are suggesting.

You already know. I think I'm pretty  much in the same boat - when I'm working on a logline I'm working on the best way to work it, to make it work as a sales tool.   And that's great.  But there are a lot of people who aren't in that boat.   Spend some time reading loglines from relative beginners.  Yes, there is the sales-problem aspect of it. ""Did you mean X? Or did you mean Y?"" But there's also the problem of, ""You meant Z? But Z isn't a movie.""  You don't have this problem. Rad. A lot of people do.

It doesn't even have to be a whole page... To me the idea of working out something so large in the confines of two sentences is asking for frustration and even failure. I think a writer needs some room to work out the problems in their story. I sure do.   I developed a few baby writers and their screenplays over the years, and the last thing I would do is pen them into to such a limited space."

I have taught (although I'm happy not to be doing so now) and worked on all of those things before working on a logline. (Although actually, as a teacher I gave students latitude to have a three-five sentence logline, so maybe we're getting blurry here between a logline and a short synopsis). And I actually had my students write a scene that gave me the character and a scene that gave me the flavor before they worried about the plot."

Check it against your logline and make sure you're delivering on your premise.  It has nothing to do with outlining, stop conflating the two."
Screenwriting,3cwwxc,donkey_puncherello,2,Sat Jul 11 20:41:44 2015 UTC,"To be honest I don't find loglines helpful in ""guiding"" the story at all. They are just a sharpened summary of the overall story. When I'm trying to outline a story I'm guided more by the characters and plot I've established as well as having an idea of where I want the story to end up. I've never actually gone to my logline when I'm stuck somewhere in Act 2. In fact, I find tying myself down to a logline before I've fully explored the story somewhat restrictive!  I agree with /u/ChinaskiBlur. I usually come up with a rough logline in my head before I outline just to know where the story can start and end up and just to see if the idea has any dramatic potential.   edit: clarity"

I believe you and perhaps others are sending the wrong message to young writers. I also believe that is you who is conflating the two elements. Two sentences, in my opinion, cannot feasibly or effectively guide anyone through a 100+ page screenplay, let alone serve as a measure to the efficacy a specific multi-page scene with multiple characters. That seems mad to me. An outline, however, can. But if you want to waste hours, weeks, months or whatever perfecting two sentences, good on ya. I'm enjoying the debate nonetheless."
Screenwriting,3cwwxc,ChinaskiBlur,-1,Sat Jul 11 21:06:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not offended, just worried about the effect what you're saying could have on writers who haven't yet figured out their processes.  For some people, the logline is an essential tool to development. Without it, their scripts might lack focus or stakes or clear pro/antagonists. I'm not suggesting people rehearse their pitches before they write the script, I'm just suggesting that it might be effective to have a concise statement of purpose, so to speak. I compared it to a thesis already, if you figure it out before you write it'll guide and laser-focus you; if you dont, things can get rambly, murky, and not paced out correctly.  I don't think any of us are suggesting spending weeks or months on one logline. Not to mention, if the script is well thought out and clear, the logline should come pretty easily."

It's fine if your loglines help you through the outlining process but outlines are something in and of themselves. Loglines are not the spine of a story either.   Here I did a quick search for you to help define what a logline is and why the OP is 100% correct about the logline being produced from the screenplay not the other way around.   A logline is a one (or occasionally two) sentence description that boils the script down to its essential dramatic narrative in as succinct a manner as possible.   *EDIT for Dyslexia

Loglines do not represent, in any effective way at least, who the protag really is, or what their struggles are... loglines are a pitching tool, nothing more.

But a logline is a sales tool and it's something that doesn't need to be calibrated to 100% until you have something ready to sell.
Screenwriting,3cwwxc,Dofleini,5,Sat Jul 11 14:49:40 2015 UTC,"I still disagree.   One thing I see a ton when people workshop loglines is that there isn't a well-formed story inside that logline.

There are a lot of times I've given advice on a logline that addressed some fundamental ""what the story is"" issue that could have been avoided if the writer have worked on their logline first.   I disagree that a logline is just a sale tool. It is, in a way, the smallest possible outline. And one of the things you do with your outline is zoom out - look at what the story looks like from 1,000 miles away - and then zoom back in, and then zoom out again, and then zoom in, etc - and the logline is the 1,000 mile view of your story.   Furthermore, look, writing is rewriting. The logline may change as new discoveries happen. That doesn't mean you shouldn't write it in the first place."

However, if I can't get a logline down, early in the process that I'm happy with, I would rather move on to another idea.   When I'm writing, I start with an idea and try to outline. The logline comes from that. I outline some more and try to do all the heavy lifting. The logline often gets tweaked.   At some point, the break has to be made from outlining to writing the script. At this point, I like to put the logline on the top of my computer and I write."
Screenwriting,3cwwxc,Dofleini,3,Sun Jul 12 02:21:50 2015 UTC,"I actually disagree as well. You don't necessarily NEED a great longline before you start, but it's usually better to have one. Generally you're trying to sell a script, either literally sell it or ""sell"" it/yourself to an agent/manager as something they can literally sell. So, it can be great to have a good compass in a logline while you write. The logline may change along the way, but it will hopefully push you in a direction that will read, and sell, well."

Sales tools are used to gain interest, get past gatekeepers, and so on---selling a script or almost anything of substance is a process and and ""tools"" are utilized (including loglines) to get the sale. And if you have a killer logline, you better have the script on hand or you'll only end up an afterthought.

I might point out that it's all world building, no story.   The script either doesn't reflect the log line or it does. If the script is good, there's probably a better way to pitch it. What's more likely, from a lot of experience, is that the log line actually does reflect a script and you get one of those dreary ones where the midpoint should really be at the start of act two.

Vetting a logline before you write the script can save you months and months of your life. It's analogous to a battle plan. They all change upon first contact with the enemy, but a general who'd send his forces into battle and see what plan shapes up organically isn't using his resources very well."

You can't tell me what Matt is doing and what the whole film is about in two-sentences... not effectively.  A two-sentence ""battle plan"" will likely end in defeat--and I don't like a script's chances with similar preparation.

That literally happens every day in every profession.  You can write a logline at any point, tweak it however you want while you write the script, it doesn't matter. Obviously you should write the script that goes with the logline, but if you don't, then that's on you, the writer. It definitely isn't on some random douchebag from /r/screenwriting to tell you you're doing something wrong, and moreover, chastise people who want help refining their ideas/concepts.

First it's figuring out the idea, then figuring out if the idea actually has potential, and then writing the script, and then leave it to fate. Sometimes you come to realization that what you're doing is no good about halfway through.   It is exciting and fun, but it's just never easy, but nothing compares to actually finishing it and then people telling you ""Hey, I like this!""   EDIT to add: But also, it may have to do with the way I am as a person. I already have issues with anxiety and I try not to let anything exacerbate it. Plenty of stuff about screenwriting terrifies me already, but I try not to let it get it to me. It's counterproductive to let it get it to you and paralyze you. So I guess it is a balance. I think it's okay to be scared and let it drive you into doing better, but as long as you're not missing the forest for the trees and you're not letting it freeze you, you're good."

Equal parts that shot of Bradley Cooper with the words and algorithms circling his head as he's typing in Limitless and the end of The Wicker Man. I love it at times but I'm not the biggest fan of myself personally so I have this huge chip on my shoulder. I'm constantly trying to prove my worth to myself. So as soon as I start writing shit, I get super depressed and withdraw from it again. I don't know. It's the only thing I have though. I don't see myself ever stopping. If only I were as good as I wish I could be."

They joked about one day, just not getting work. They are top-tier guys, but there are so many WGA writers that don't get work for extended periods of time.

I think TV staff is usually under more pressure than the average feature writer, though I only get that impression from reading the posts here.   I write features (and one short), so this is my experience: The best writing I've done has come from real passion and excitement. I wouldn't say I ever write out of fear or insecurity, though I've done a lot of writing in a place of ""I'll hate myself more if I don't write today"". I never really feel like a whole human being unless I have something to show for a day's work.  I think I ever got to a place where writing was totally unenjoyable, I would probably quit. But I hope that never happens."

It's exhausting, solitary work. No one cares about the work, not friends, not loved ones, nobody, so the writer must nurture his ugly, bumbling Frankensteins while the world mostly pities him and his writerly affliction. Most times I religiously hate writing. I write only when I feel I must.

Screenwriting,3cxqxm,SmartAlice,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:33:53 2015 UTC,"I love to write and that's all there is to that.  I do a lot of focusing exercise, meditation and training exercise so when my brain gets stuck, it doesn't stay there.  My brain is my most valuable asset, so I take care of it.  I eat a lot when I'm writing (I weigh 125lbs), because I'm using a lot of energy. So I make sure I have healthy snacks, I take vitamins and drink lots of water.  I don't eat anything with gluten because it causes brain fog & I need my brain to function at the highest possible level.  And I don't drink soda 'cause the sugar makes me sluggish and I can't write.  I wasn't always like this, I met some very disciplined people that were doing really well, so I followed in their foot steps.  I did a project last year, I worked 12 to 16 hours a day (Mon-Sun) for about two months.  My neck, back and booty hurt, I didn't have time to meditate or do anything. It was just focusing on the work at hand.  I didn't waste time being dramatic and complaining about how hard it was.  It was a job, that's all.  A lot of people make writing seem so dramatic, because it sounds good and makes them seem more interesting.   I hand write all my stories, first with my left hand ('cause it's coming from the right side of my brain) then I'll write the same concept with my right hand.  I take both version and turn it into one.  I've been doing this for years.  It's the best of both worlds (left and right brain).  I never get stuck or struggle, I just switch hands."
Screenwriting,3cyagd,bluejackets722,2,Sat Jul 11 21:43:24 2015 UTC,"I thought that was good and humourous. A few of my thoughts.   The humour is good, but a lot of it is based around references I'm not sure many people would get. Much of it is what I'd consider in-jokes. Something to think about is...would my mother find this funny, would my non-geeky sister find this funny, would my grandma? Would the average person understand a joke about Pokemon. That's not to say you need to remove these jokes, but that a lot of these jokes would fall flat for many people. Tee / Tea time joke. Not sure that would work when said out loud? It'd just be confusing. Characters. I don't feel you really get a true sense of the characters in the reality TV show section. They are all a bit two dimensional. It's hard to tell where one person starts and the other ends. I think an added problem of this is the dialogue. Basically all the characters have the same voice. This is hard for me to explain, but it seems like you've come up with snappy dialogue but haven't thought about who is saying it. So all of the dialogue sounds like you having a conversation with you (does that make sense.) The upside though is that you have lots of potential here for satire. I think the premise is there but it's not so satirical. Like you could incorporate or amp up a lot more stereotypical elements that are often in reality TV and you could use this to help strength the characters. Push it even further though. You've already done this with the Z-list actor trying to make a comeback (which is great) but for the other characters it doesn't really happen. You know you could have the in your face gay guy, the wannabe celebrity with fake tits etc. All these people you usually see on reality TV. The characters you have now seem too beige and normal? One question I think it's good to ask is why do these people want to be on TV? It's clear for the actor, but what about the others. This would influence what they say and how they act. Actually, I really like the idea of one of the guests being disabled. Reality TV is all about inspiring stories now. You could have them in the control room talking about how they can make the disabled girl win to increase ratings etc. Or they can control emotions to make people fall in love. All these tropes of ""reality"" TV. I like the premise for a pilot. You have two stories that work well together. The guys trying to get their show funded and the people trying to escape the island. Essentially the pilot is them making a pilot to sell. You could get some good jokes out of that material.  The character of Carl isn't really needed. He doesn't really do anything that Donald or Andy couldn't. There's nothing stopping one of them from jumping on the computer to control all that stuff which would tighten it up a little. You could merge Carl and Andy together, so he's the best friend and designer."

I've previously studied for a BA in Film & TV in Australia, but that was more of a general overview of a variety of roles you could have in the industry and wanted more of a specific kind of training that USC or UCLA could provide.

At the moment, moving to LA is kind of like a last straw in which if it doesn't go well, I'll have to kind of reconsider what I'm going to do in the future as I'm not sure if I have the same passion or creative drive to pursue a career in film as I did when I decided to kick myself in the butt and try my luck in London. At the moment, I'm not getting the feedback I would like on the things I wish to get feedback on.

USC has started to emphasize TV a lot more in the past decade, but that's smart of them, because that's where the work is. More than twice as many WGA members make money in television in a typical year than make money in features. (Last year, those numbers were approximately 1600 in feature-land and approximately 3900 in TV).   That is to say, a screenwriting program that ignores television is doings its students a MASSIVE disservice.   But the notion that USC ignores feature is just wrong. I don't know the UCLA program as well, but I would be SHOCKED if they ignored television.  If they do, the chair of the department is being negligent in his duties.   The NYU program is supposed to be very good, but I don't know anything about it specifically.   The thing about film school is, really: assume it's going to take you a decade after you graduate.

But really, they won't teach you anything you can't find in a seminar on YouTube.  But you will get educated feedback on your writing and if you put in the effort you will become accustomed to writing on a deadline which is key.

Also, if we did it this way where one person did a lot of the work, and there was ownership based on who participated, then the person who led the thing and did most the work would get most of the gain if anything came of it. So say they got 50% of the profit and everyone else got a cut of the other 50%. Something like that. Or there could be different tiers of compensation based on how much they did."
Screenwriting,3d07z7,tpounds0,2,Sun Jul 12 17:30:15 2015 UTC,"Or there could be different tiers of compensation based on how much they did.   This sounds like a legitimate nightmare!! How would you fairly decide that?  Also, the idea of such a work selling is absurd. Too many cooks spoil the broth. The script wouldn't be good. Most people on here are not good writers."
Screenwriting,3d07z7,tpounds0,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:41:04 2015 UTC,"But the key is to get someone good as the ""leader"".  They would be the quality control person. Everyone else would just be like worker bees. We would provide ideas and do grunt work. But it would be the job of the leader to put it all together and make something coherent out of it. They could oversee our progress as we worked to make sure we were doing things so they fit in the story.  And as for the compensation aspect I think the leader could choose who they want for different jobs. The better writers involved who wanted to do more work would get a bigger cut. Say like 3 percent of the overall profit and there would be 10 of those people. Then the rest of the people would split up the rest.   I also think this could work because the higher level folks could be like mentors and we learn but help them get the project done quickly and provide tons of ideas. Would any of this work? I have no idea.. I am just throwing ideas out there."
Screenwriting,3d07z7,tpounds0,2,Sun Jul 12 19:49:33 2015 UTC,"But why work so hard to make something like this work?   I mean, if you're going for a world record like, most people to work collaboratively on a screenplay, then maybe. That's like the only accolade something like this could ever achieve.   It's not even helpful as a writing exercise.    Screenwriters are by nature opinionated/creative enough to want to express their ideas. What happens when you get a lot of opinionated and creative people working on one single piece of writing? It won't work."
Screenwriting,3d07z7,spentrent,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:55:36 2015 UTC,The purpose to me would be to try to solve an incredibly difficult problem. Or something that required a huge amount of research or creativity. If we all voted on different aspects then we should have everyone on the same page.  The reason I personally thought of this idea is because I had an idea for some script but I had no idea how it could actually be done. It's so weird that I doubt others would be interested... but it gave me the idea for this concept. I thought it would be a good learning experience for those involved too.
Screenwriting,3d07z7,naive_babes,3,Sun Jul 12 20:08:18 2015 UTC,"Just write the idea you want to do.   Instead of pretending there’s a million dollar prize for writing the best script ever, pretend your very life depends on proving that you suck. Pretend there are Nazi soldiers going door to door in your neighborhood, shooting all the good writers in the head. They just got to your door and they want you to see a sample of your work. If you give them any indication that you have the slightest bit of literary talent, or style, or knowledge of storytelling, you are going to die. Save your life by making them say, “not only is this guy not a good writer, he’s not even a writer.” That’s called a first draft.    -Dan Harmon."

So the leader would most likely be someone who is not a professional. So we have to figure out who the best amateur is who could lead it. But then he doesn't have the experience to really deserve 50% if it does sell.  And that's before even starting to write the damn thing."
Screenwriting,3d07z7,beardsayswhat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:07:14 2015 UTC,To me the benefit to the leader would be to do something they couldn't do on their own. Like if it was something that required a ton of research or a lot of creativity to solve difficult aspects. And if we were doing the grunt work it could potentially get done very quickly compared to a normal script where one person has to do all the work.
Screenwriting,3d07z7,poseymund,2,Sun Jul 12 20:11:52 2015 UTC,"So the benefits are time. Which makes sense, it's why there are so many writers for TV, even more for Late Night Comedy Shows, and usually more for Awards shows.  But the problem is Spec screenplays have no time requirements. Sure you could install some arbitrary ones. But that's to decrease the money that this one person could do with their idea.  And as for accomplishing an idea one person couldn't do? I believe that, but definitely not in a reddit group. And the leader will already turn off the group mind that would allow true collaboration."
Screenwriting,3d07z7,beardsayswhat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:21:56 2015 UTC,"Think of it like feedback too though. Normally when you are doing a project you don't get much feedback. It's why so much stuff stinks a lot of the time. Maybe if more people were involved and gave a lot of feedback the writer/s could gauge more how things were perceived. So the masses could provide - grunt work, creativity, problem-solving and feedback. I think that's a lot of stuff. But you might be right and it wouldn't benefit them. This is just how I envision it. I am an extreme beginner so I am probably wrong. :)  Basically it's the concept of ""two heads are better than one"" taken to the extreme."
Screenwriting,3d07z7,poseymund,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:30:16 2015 UTC,But I get feedback for free from plenty of sources. Once you show you have the dedication to actually write people are happy to help with feedback on making something good great.
Screenwriting,3d07z7,beardsayswhat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:35:29 2015 UTC,That's true but this would be feedback and creativity while the person is writing it. So you may get different ideas than you normally would because of those different minds adding their input.

Screenwriting,3cx3aj,8bit_Llama,2,Sat Jul 11 17:55:20 2015 UTC,"I usually outline out my first draft pretty meticulously to prevent this issue, and if I have back-of-the-mind suspicions that it's still convoluted in some way, I go back to the drawing board and iron them out before continuing.    Though, there was one time that I wrote something that got pretty far away from me. I didn't realize how off the rails it was until a friend read it and went ""yeah, this is ridiculous. You can't do this.""  I was working on an alternate history type of movie in the same type of mood as Idiocracy, about the hypothetical faking of the moon landing.  It followed the hiring of Stanly Kubrick, rehearsal and table reads with the actors who played the Apollo crew, and Neil Armstrong continually fucking up his ""One small step for a man"" line. It was fun.    But I went totally crazy with it, and decided that it should keep zooming out and I kept incorporating more and more conspiracy theories.  Fake wars, shapeshifting aliens, in the third act the protagonist discovers the world is flat, and then the ""final twist"" was that all of reality was a simulation in the first place in some children's video game like The Sims.    I sent it out to a few people and got almost exclusively negative feedback. So I tend to write more contained stories, now."
Screenwriting,3cx3aj,darth_elevator,2,Sat Jul 11 18:07:26 2015 UTC,"I would see that movie.  My problem is that one of the sub-plots has mutated into the main plot, and I'm trying to figure out a way to keep the conflict that the subplot raises while keeping the main plot the main plot.  The tone has shifts that I'm not comfortable with, but the character arc in the sub-plot are important to the climax.  It might not be a huge problem, but I have three finished scripts to go along with three unfinished ones, so I'd like to get this one ""finished"" so I can get the finished-unfinished ratio in the plus column.  Silly reason to power through I guess, but I'm a silly man."
Screenwriting,3cx3aj,darth_elevator,2,Sat Jul 11 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"It's always easier to fix a finished screenplay than an unfinished one.  When the piece is a ""whole"" the mis-steps a little clearer.    You don't want to come off uneven in tone, but shifting focus in the plot can work if it's called for. Fargo kind of does this, off the top of my head.  And Place Beyond the Pines totally switches protagonists. Twice.   I'd have to know more specifics to know if you're losing focus, or if that's just natural for the story you're telling.  Unrelated, but 3 for 3 is not a bad ratio.  I'm at, like, 25 for 5.  Sometimes you can just tell when something was better in concept than execution."

Screenwriting,3cx3aj,Xxoxia,2,Sat Jul 11 21:52:43 2015 UTC,"It's best to go back and change what's needed to be changed.  Otherwise, the following pages will be the continuation of the messed up story, rather than what you want it to be.   This is why it's best to start with an outline.  That way, you realize these things in the outline and can change it much easier, before you start the script.  Believe me.  I started my first script March of 2014, finished the first draft in Jan 2015, and am still working on the rewrite.  Still not done an outline."
Screenwriting,3cx3aj,lwarrent,2,Sun Jul 12 01:04:02 2015 UTC,I would go back to the point right before it goes off the rails and outline everything that happens from that point forward.

However, I'm actually doing the opposite of that on my current project. My first act isn't very good. I realized that I needed to drastically change it when I got to about page 60. However, I'm on a bit of a personal deadline (gonna have to put the script down for a bit shortly) and I'd rather not have that pause happen while the script is half written, so I'm powering through.  However, I'm fairly experienced at this, and I know what the new first act has to do. I'm capable of just sort of lifting that act out in my head and assuming I have something new in there that does what I want it to do.   There really aren't any ""tangled web"" issues here. I know exactly where the first act needs to end. I just don't know which path I'm going to take to get there.   If the problems were deeper than that, if they were going to moot work I was doing in the second and third acts, I would not just keep working. I'd fix it. But in this case, I'm charing ahead."
Screenwriting,3cw30w,KISSTOKILL112,9,Sat Jul 11 06:53:56 2015 UTC,"Reminded me of this comment I came a across a while ago:   ON MOVING TO LA You have to do it everyone. YOU HAVE TO DO IT, and there are no exceptions to this rule. I, too, harbored the illusion that I could live somewhere else and still make it as a screenwriter, because--why not?--writers can write from anywhere, right? Wrong. And hell, it wasn't like I was living in the middle of nowhere, I was living in downtown Manhattan, the center of it all, for 12 years. FINALLY, I got my act together and moved out here to Hollywood just a few months ago (arrived June 15 2013), and finally, my career is now actually starting. Two reasons I decided to take the plunge:    1) A director approached me to write a script for him (while I was in NYC), and though I ultimately turned him down (he didn't have enough money for the project, see below) we did talk about his career etc, the guy had made about a dozen features, and at one point he said, ""You know, I love NYC, I'm from here, but man, if you want to make it in this biz, you HAVE to live in LA."" ""Why's that?"" I asked. ""Surely a writer can work from anywhere? And I can just fly in as needed?"" ""Nope,"" he said, ""That's the thing, you can write from anywhere, sure, but you can only GET GIGS while you're out in LA. Every directing gig I've ever gotten, it's always been me hangin' out by some friend's pool at a party in the Hollywood Hills or whatever, and I get to talking to some other dude, turns out they need a director for this thing coming up, and boom, I have the job. It's ALL who you talk to and who you hang out with out there, that's where all your work is gonna come from."" Wow, eye-opener.    And 2) A producer friend of mine (this was right after the above director episode) said, ""You know that no one's ever gonna rep you if you don't live in LA, right?"" (Insert loud record needle scratch here) Me: ""Um, what? Why's that? I live in NYC. Lots of writers live here."" Him: ""Yeah, but they're already rich and famous. You haven't broken in yet. You can only do that in LA."" Me: ""Shit. Really?"" Him: ""Think about it. You're a hot young agent at William Morris or wherever. You have 5 hot young screenwriters in front of you, each with an awesome spec, all of them on the verge of breaking through. You can only rep ONE of them. Four of them live in LA, one of them lives in NYC. Four of them have made the commitment to put their LA time in and get serious about their work, one has not. Now tell me, as the agent, which is the first of these writers that will definitely get cut from the running?"" Me (again): ""Shit."" Him: ""That's right, the out of town guy. Nobody wants to work with someone who hasn't made the commitment to be in LA full-time. It's a social business. They want to know that you're a cool guy, that you're eager, dedicated, responsible. And if they're gonna put you up for a huge writing assignment, they want to be able to meet with you, keep tabs on you. That ain't gonna happen if you're in NYC."" (Or anywhere NOT in LA.)    So that's it guys--if you haven't made the commitment to come out here, then you haven't made the commitment to get serious about your career (yet). And let me tell you, it's absolutely true: I've only been out here a few months, and I've already met some extremely highly placed people who (by the look of it) are more than a little eager to read the script I'm about to finish--people who are going to get this thing out there and, hopefully, get it sold and get it made (and who knows, maybe I'll come back with a success story in just a little bit). So yeah, if you're not here, find a way to get here. And while what Carson says is true, you CAN get noticed writing from outside of LA, don't forget the crucial follow-up to that: all the writers who DID get noticed writing from outside LA then had to move LA if they wanted to actually get their careers going. I don't care how awesome your spec is, the next question on everyone's lips is inevitably going to be, ""Hey, this is great--so when are you moving out here?"" Cement this in your mind--and then plan accordingly. Source   Your thoughts?"
Screenwriting,3cw30w,MidtownWest,2,Sat Jul 11 12:26:49 2015 UTC,"Probably.  There are a lot of screenwriting workshops where you can network.  I recommend doing that.

Screenwriting,3cw30w,BAIIPlus,2,Sat Jul 11 07:28:12 2015 UTC,"I went to a workshop from this group:  http://www.nycscreenwriter.org/  The course was 2 hours and cost $25.  It was a pretty great and informative class, similar to what you'd get from a good college prof (the teacher at this one was an NYU professor).  There wasn't a lot of actual workshopping or building but the information was good.  If you have an extra $25 there will be another workshop on August 1st.  What was really cool about the course is that I met another screenwriter afterward and started talking just by saying ""That was a great class"".  We emailed back and forth, and now I'll be working on his short film and getting credited as some sort of producer.  I'll be meeting a bunch of other film people at the shoot.  More work will come.  Someday maybe I'll get paid.  Anyway, I am also NY based, and I also write the screenplays.  If you ever want to meet up, or even just get notes on something you're writing let me know.  I'm here on an internship which ends in September.  I'm always up for networking."
Screenwriting,3cw30w,LordHuntyboad,2,Sat Jul 11 07:38:17 2015 UTC,"That's the best thing about courses. People often rubbish them with phrases like ""you can't TEACH writing"", but I've found that the course material has been 20% of what is useful, the rest is meeting a peer group and collaborators.  In terms of breaking in from New York, it is totally possible. Just make something of your own - a short film, a teaser, a two minute web series - and if it's good it'll get in festivals or get some interest (my NYC based friend ended up at the Sundance lab this year this way).  How do you make something of your own? Take some classes and meet some collaborators. AND WE'RE BACK FULL CIRCLE."
Screenwriting,3cw30w,HotspurJr,2,Sat Jul 11 21:45:16 2015 UTC,"New York City is probably the only place outside of LA where it's reasonable to try to break in from. You're still going to have to come to LA a lot.   The reality is that most of the work is in LA. This is particularly true of TV. While there are a few shows that have their writers rooms in New York, the vast majority are in LA. If you get a job, that job will require that you be here. Since writers rooms on successful shows are often running from June to April, you're living in LA.   If you can afford to fly back and forth often, it matters less. But it still matters - especially when you are still breaking in.   Look, my first real WGA job happened because the development exec wanted to meet with me and my partner, and we met her two days later, and in that meeting we did such a good job thinking on our feet that she agreed to hear our pitch first, and not hear any others if we nailed it. We took two weeks to put the pitch together and get it perfect, and we could afford to do that because nobody else was pitching on the project.   If it had taken us two weeks to get to that first meeting because we had to schedule flights, we probably wouldn't have gotten that job.  We also had to, being baby writers, pitch that job three times: to her, to her boss, and to the president of the company. If you're counting, you'll realize that's four cross-country flights for one job. Now realize that you often pitch and don't get the job.   And it's not like work is so abundant that you can say ""oh, if I didn't get this one, I'll get the next one.""  Plenty of writers spend a year or two between jobs, so missing on a job that you could have gotten if you hadn't had to waste time figuring out how to get across the country can easily be the difference between needing to get a day job or not.   The margins in this business are so small, and the jobs so competitive, that you can not afford to miss any advantage - ESPECIALLY when you are starting out. People like to say ""well, if you're good enough, it'll happen for you"" but I'm not remotely sure that's true. It takes hard work, perseverance, talent, luck ... and the ability to run hard at any opportunity.  Being outside of LA means you have to run harder and you STILL get there slower.   There are other advantages, too. Look, if you love NY and hate LA, maybe you've got to try to do it from there. But don't pretend that it won't be harder, and don't pretend that it being harder doesn't matter."
Screenwriting,3cw30w,8bit_Llama,2,Sat Jul 11 16:51:12 2015 UTC,"It helps to live in LA, but as a counterpoint, two buddies of mine (a writing team) live in New York, have always lived in New York, broke in from New York, and now they're crazy successful.

Screenwriting,3cwmjj,AndrewPenner,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:14:28 2015 UTC,"Conceptually the idea of ""drug trip gone bad"" played for horror is a good one. I don't think this draft works though. It sort of feels like set up and payoff are disconnected. We start off with a guy with his perception altered by whatever he's taken, then it jumps ahead a little when he wakes up and we get scary TV images. Sure this might be related to the drug he took but in horror stories this sort of thing is something that happens on it's own. It feels like the script just decided to do something else. This happens again when you end on the doppelganger. It feels like the pay off to a different set up. I would rethink what this drug trip actually does to your characters and find something that feels like it flows naturally the whole way through.  I would also recommend doing a little more homework RE: drug use. Neither character talks like someone who regularly uses as the script suggests they are. Also this line really stood out to me:  ""Hanna loads the powder into the bong""  No. A bong is not a drug gun, you don't load it and shoot highs at people with it. When you want to smoke out of a bong you pack the bowl at the bong's base. Try not to forget small details like that as they will affect the whole a lot more then you think."

Screenplays are always difficult to write, but they're especially difficult when you haven't written one before, so it helps to have fun with your material. My first script was a bleak legal drama, which interested me but was a slog to write. For my second script, I wrote a breezy spy flick, and I had a ton of fun writing it. Neither were very good because I was just starting out, but writing the second one brought me back to what I really loved about movies and gave me the fuel to keep writing."

There was something insane and exhilarating about working with something non-linear, with unreliable narrators, with a good old murder-mystery, with someone questioned about a crime he's not sure he didn't commit.   There's a fabulous little contest (read:diversion) called Midnight Madness. It's for shorts. I think they went from max 20 pags down to a max of 12 or 15, I'm not sure. Anyway, their schtick is you get ""assigned"" your script -- via random draw you're in with a group of 20-25 others all with the same assignment, and they give you genre and some sort of subject. It's crazy the situations you find yourself in --- oh, and then you have a short window in which to write and submit your script. I've written in Mockumentary there, which is sooooooooo outside my comfort zone, but definitely challenged me.

Films are generally one arc/story, with a beginning, middle and end. TV, on the other hand, is usually a series of stories (episodes) that each have their own self contained beginning, middle and end. These episodes build the story arc for the season, and the seasons build the the series. Breaking Bad and Mad Men, which are very cinematic in style and tone, would lose a lot if they were movies instead of TV.   I guess it's the difference between an adventure and an odyssey.

I think you're right that certain forms like novel and screenplay have far less distance between them but --   The cutting and editing may chop it around and you may even need to create new scenes, but the essential story in terms of arc and so on will be the same.   Is it, though? The main two I'm caught between are ""ongoing comic book"" (open-ended but basically require cliffhangers or at least some closure every 20- to 22-pages these days) and ""feature screenplay"" (more limited in scope but you have more time to explore). Maybe I have to start with the screenplay and then treat it like a debut for the comic?  Yeah, I'm really in my head about this."

Screenwriting,3cv51u,IAmWindar,3,Sat Jul 11 01:30:31 2015 UTC,"My two cents:  If the majority of the movie is just about someone struggling with guilt that doesn't sound particularly exciting. It also feels like the inner journey the character might go through rather than the plot of the story.   Also why does the sword have to be imaginary? If it's just about someone accidentally chopping someone else's head off, couldn't it not be a real sword that accidentally ended up as a prop. If I watched a film where someone's head got chopped off by an imaginary sword in the first act, I would expect that magical element to be a big part of the rest of the story."
Screenwriting,3cv51u,tpounds0,3,Sat Jul 11 08:28:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed. That magical element needs to be the story, the subplot would be him struggling with his guilt.  Loglines need to be 1 or 2 sentences. This from Die Hard: ""A New York cop tries to save his estranged wife from terrorists who have taken an L.A. office building hostage on Christmas Eve"".  Also, what's at stake in your story? He struggles with the guilt. That could go on for years.  In Die Hard, McClane will save his wife or he won't. Either way there is and ending.  Know your ending."

Thanks to your advice I was able to do this one. It's short and shows what the second act is about. The inner struggle happens parallel to a media storm that takes more of the plot.
Screenwriting,3cv51u,beardsayswhat,2,Sat Jul 11 14:41:19 2015 UTC,"I guess you are going for a pastiche/parody of magical realism Guillermo Del Toro movies.

(Like Disney with Enchanted)  It's just a weird story, in a way I don't like. And I usually read the weirdest scripts."
Screenwriting,3cv51u,tpounds0,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:50:19 2015 UTC,"Ok.  Very probably I did not nail the tone of this thing at all. This is not a parody nor a comedy. English is not my first language.   I'll try to tell it in a non-logline format.  Fernando is a struggling actor. He has kind of a steady job giving improv shows once a week. He has money but not that much. One day he gets a call from his best friend, telling him he got a role in a GDT movie. Fernando fights to not sound like he is not envious but he is.  Later that night they are in front of the audience acting a medieval scene. Fernando is a knight and his friend is a dragon, and Fernando has to save the princess. Fernando gets deep into his character and swings his imaginary sword right through his friend's neck. The head falls off.   Fernando is taken to the police station but freed because he didn't actually do anything. This all happens in the first twelve pages.  The rest of the screenplay is about Fernando fighting some sort of depression and media storm, trying to defend himself from all society's accusations. Because of this fame he gets a job offer in Los Angeles, at first rejecting it. But later and because of getting tired of defending himself some kind of cynism gets the best of him so he goes out to LA to live the life his friend should have lived.  He finally accepts his guilt, and now he doesn't care.  I kind of play with some views of Mexican society and shit like that. But am having a hard time making the logline in english (or spanish for that matter)."

And from that description no one will like Fernando for killing his best friend for a job. That's a character ruining moment. Look at this articles comments where people lose any empathy with the main character after he tortures a mouse. I would feel the same way for someone that kills his best friend over an acting job.  This is an interesting little magical realism movie, why not just focus on the sword and the act.  Have you heard of LARPING?  That would make a good set up for imaginary killings made real.   And then just make the reason he is jealous of the friend Higher stakes, something that the audience would wince at in their seats so that when he accidentally kills him the audience thinks it is justified."

If the family of the boyfriend she accidentally killed ended up coming after her for revenge I would side with them.  And he's implying that his envy fuels the accident in the first place. I'd say either make the accident a full on accident for the tragedy or double down and make the audience feel like his friend slighted him. Probably by dating the girl the best friend knew our hero was in love with from afar.

Screenwriting,3cv8uk,Daxtreme,3,Sat Jul 11 01:35:08 2015 UTC,"The definitive answer is to do it, when you do it, for a reason.   When you're starting out, do it because the scene doesn't make sense without a particular action there. It's the notion of an action vs an activity: an action is an attempt by the character to accomplish something, to further their goals. An activity is just business. If you cut the activities out, the scene doesn't fundamentally change. If you cut the actions out, it does.   Beginners tend to engage in ""puppeteering"" which is bad - giving the characters too many gestures and pointless activities. A good rule of thumb is that if you have actors reading the lines, and somebody reading the narration, is: do the actors have a tendency to want to run over the line of description? If so, cut it.   As you gain more experience, you'll get more comfortable worrying less about a strict ""only actions, no activities"" breakdown. Sometimes you'll stick an action in to help control the flow and emphasis. I find it's particularly important in comedy (for me, at least): when there's a joke in the middle of a line, putting an action after the joke can help call attention to the joke.   Obviously, something like that gets tedious if you do it all the time, but it's another tool in your toolbox. I would encourage you to err on the side of doing it less often while you're gaining experience."

You're a writer and you get to write. Just have a reason for what you do besides ""make the page look better.""

There is one action line."
Screenwriting,3cv49g,Grachamoncha,2,Sat Jul 11 00:54:25 2015 UTC,"From my point of view this makes barely any sense. Sorry, maybe I'm tired or something but I didn't really understand most of it.  The problems for me were:   It jumps around too much between points in time without any reference to when and where they are. I assume it's jumping around between different time periods but it's hard to know as you only mention a couple of times the physical differences. Obviously you've got the time of day in there but I don't feel that's enough for a person reading to understand (Ok, they're in another time period now.) Maybe it's better to put the time period in the scene headings. Like ""INT. DINER - 1986"" or to mention the actual age of your boy and girl. It was hard for me to tell if this was a series of conversations or just 3 conversations intercut. I didn't realise until the end that it was the latter. This isn't helped by the fact the conversations are vague. They seem to be about something but it's impossible to know what they're talking about at all because you jump into the middle of conversations. We can't remember (or don't know) what they were talking about before. It's like a lot of dialogue where people are going, ""I really like it."" ""Yeah, it is great, remember that time when it was really good."" ""Oh yeah, it was great!"" Without knowing what It is, it's hard to understand these conversations. I didn't know what your characters were talking about half the time because they were skirting around issues and also saying what seems like philosophical things which just seem like nonsense and without us knowing the issues it's impossible to take anything from what they're saying. Additionally, I didn't understand what was happening. The few things I understood from reading it were that they were on again off again lovers, that some kind of disaster had happened, that possibly the guy saw some aliens (?) and that they'd possibly committed suicide at the end?  Note that BOY and GIRL are terms for children. Are they children in every scene? Just adds to the confusion. I feel doing this is just trying to add style to your screenplay but wouldn't add anything to the film. On a positive front I like the concept of three conversations intercut, showing three different time periods / moments in time. However I think the script needs a rewrite to give a better sense that there are only three conversations and to make the dialogue more understandable. I think the simpler the dialogue the better. One a first date, one a last date, the other one an argument. It would work well even without all the philosophical nonense."

It's a bit of a shortcut that paints a picture in broad strokes, rather than getting detailed. I just think there are more striking ways to write it, that aren't as simplistic as ""A = B"".   There's also the possibility of clash. If you describe a character as ""Tom Hanks"", but the character does things that (in my mental image of him) Tom Hanks would never do, then you've accidentally created an inconsistent character.  That being said, one of my all-time favorite character descriptions is an apocryphal one from Panic Room, where David Koepp describes Forest Whitaker's character as ""Humphrey Bogart in one of his less pleasant roles"". I don't know if that ever made it into the script, but it's always stuck in my mind: succinct, vivid, clean."

Thirdly, it doesn't just use the actor's most obvious persona as a crutch.   That last one is the big one. There's something soft about just leaning on someone else's persona, especially because a lot of the people you'd use these people are actors.

Imagine you say ""think Asshole A-Lister;"" and they think of him/her and that person just f**ked that producer/executive's wife (or boyfriend, or husband, or dog, lawn jockey, or favorite hooker in the execs favorite pool/restaurant/hotel ...) or (worse) just blew a 100m project by getting caught w/[select the lastest trend in Hollywood debauchery; or licking donuts and saying ""I hate America""] or who just demanded a huge quote, got it, and the movie bombed.

The pilot for Studio 60 was 72 pages.  Compared to the 59 and 63 for the ones you mentioned.  The Newsroom (HBO, no commercials) was 85 pages.  Compare that to the True Detective pilot, (another HBO show) which is 53.   Plus, pilots are almost always longer than regular shows.  Compare the 59 page Breaking Bad pilot to this one I found from Season 3 at 48 pages.   http://leethomson.myzen.co.uk/Breaking_Bad/Breaking_Bad_3x01_-_No_Mas.pdf  Most TV show scripts (non-pilots) are closer to 50 than they are to 60.  That 48 page Breaking Bad script would time out to 32 minutes if it was 40 seconds per page.  Another exception to this is Scandal, which usually clocks in at high 50s, low 60s.

Shonda - or at least back when I talked to my friend - Shonda basically gave the writers a very free reign, and left the directors and editors to figure it out.  My friend told me how the directors would often just not shoot a bunch of stuff in the script because they were a) always behind and b) knew that it had no chance of making the final cut.   This was great for my friend, because, as she put it, it meant that she was doing more ""writing"" than normal in the editing room. It always struck me as bizarre because on some level it seems like an abdication of the writer's responsibility, but, look, that show is in its, what, 12th season? So what the hell do I know?  More to the point, every show has its own rhythm and pattern. A-page-a-minute is normal. A network half-hour is 22 minutes, a network hour is maybe 44. A cable hour is 29 or 30. Prestige shows like Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones get more flexibility. Network procedurals get almost none.   Sorkin-style dialog goes really fast, but not all banter does - there are rhythms which work fast and ones which don't.   As you gain experience, you'll gain a sense of how long your pages are running. Until then, stick to the ballpark of a page-a-minute and don't sweat it too much."
Screenwriting,3cuu9u,hideousblackamoor,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:48:22 2015 UTC,The page a minute rule is a rough estimate for features.  It doesn't apply in TV because TV is talkier. Shows like Gilmore Girls and ER had high page counts in the 60's or over. More visual shows would have lower counts. 55 pages is typical for a network hour long  (42 minutes)drama.

This was noted by his son, Christopher Buckley, who wrote of the almost comical loyalty and affection his father had shown for WordStar, which he had installed into every new computer he purchased despite the technical difficulty of such an endeavor as the program became increasingly outdated and incompatible with newer computers. He said of WordStar, ""I'm told there are better programs, but I'm also told there are better alphabets.""[27] Canadian science fiction author Robert J. Sawyer continues to use a customized version of WordStar for DOS to write his novels,[28] as does George R. R. Martin.[29] Andy Breckman, the creator of Monk, is a devout WordStar user.

Screenwriting,3csv4b,CinemaLights,5,Fri Jul 10 14:29:09 2015 UTC,This type of writing can work if you're willing to do the necessary rewriting required.
Screenwriting,3csv4b,The_Finest_,4,Fri Jul 10 15:47:32 2015 UTC,"Two things:  First of all, a lot of people who try this method wonder why they are stuck at page 60. Everything was going so well there for a while!  Secondly, the people who are successful at this method rewrite substantially. They are, essentially, outlining in script form. All good writers rewrite, but the more pre-writing work you do, the less re-writing work you're going to have to do.   So if you're capable of really rewriting - not just shuffling words around, but really saying, ""Okay, given that the script ended up being about X, and ends at point Y, does this scene belong in the script? What purpose does it serve? What purpose does it need to serve?"" then you'll be fine.   But a lot of writers end up married to something just because they wrote it, and can't ask those questions if the answers might be, ""well, I guess I've got to cut those 20 pages and come up with something else."" Which is part of why outlining is so useful - it's a lot easier to cut that much out of an outline than it is to do so out of a script.   But given that ship seems to have sailed, here, you're going to have to batten down the hatches to do the work."

Screenwriting,3csv4b,slupo,4,Fri Jul 10 17:25:03 2015 UTC,"this is referred to as the ""archaeologist method"" as you are walking along, mentally, and find a scene sticking out of the dirt, and you are so intrigued by it you start brushing more and more dirt away to find whats hidden beneath and actually attached to this idea....sometimes it's nothing, sometimes it's gold."
Screenwriting,3csv4b,mynamesyow19,2,Fri Jul 10 15:22:53 2015 UTC,"I wrote two specs this way, one with a friend and then another by myself. The one that I wrote with a friend was my first and isn't worth reading. The one I wrote by myself is a high concept thriller/drama-ish thing. I've had a few industry people read it and they responded positively. Not in a ""somebody will buy this"" way, but more of a ""there are good things here, keep writing"" way. For what it's worth, I also posted it on /r/readmyscript and got exclusively negative feedback.    However, I was really encouraged by the industry feedback, so I jumped into a pretty ambitious feature and got stuck at 60 pages.  I couldn't see my way out and I was moving at a pace of maybe 1 page per day because I had to really slog through the work to find the story. I was worried that what I had wasn't worth finishing, so I sent it to a friend whose feedback I trust and he confirmed my fears.  I had been so worried about what was going to happen next that I didn't develop the characters, so I had 60 pages of plot points that had no connection to who the characters were, and no idea where they were headed.  I still really love the first five pages, but everything after that is pretty half-baked.  I decided to let it die and move on to something else.  I'm very proud of the first one I wrote on my own, and I'm glad that I found it the way that I did, but it ended up taking about seven months to finish the first draft.  I think that success in the ""archaeologist method,"" as /u/mynamesyow19 called it, is entirely centered on how well you know your characters and how lucky you are in the first 45 pages.  You might find a lovely narrative that is rich and fulfilling, but you would more likely write yourself into a corner or end up with 45 pages of ""meh.""

Once I get to the point where I can't wait to start writing, then I know it's time.   If you want to work as a professional, it's very difficult to work this way.

I don't see why you'd want to write that one idea immediately rather than letting it grow in your head for a bit into something. A tree rather than a seed.

These scripts are a dime a dozen and there are so many out there that the subject matter might make the person reading automatically pass. I advise against it.  I'm not knocking you, or your script, in fact this sounds better than most I've heard pitched, just giving my two cents."

Screenwriting,3ctq6x,tpounds0,2,Fri Jul 10 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"I just finished UCB Sketch 301 a few weeks ago, for context.  First of all - put the commentators on-stage. That's going to be much, much funnier and clearer than just hearing them in VO. You've already got a referee for this crazy fuckin thing, so it doesn't break the reality any more than that does. Aside from that big note, this is a good premise sketch, you'd get a big laugh when those piss-stream sound effects drop in.   Cut the fancy light stuff, it's not going to happen on any reasonable sketch show that you haven't put together yourself.   Also, your character names are weird, but not exactly funny-sounding. Dwayne Andelfinger is a weird name. Dwayne Finger is a funny name. Just a tiny thing that jumped out at me.   You might consider making the ""sexy bimbo"" explicitly a man in ""sexy"" attire - you don't get laughs for actual sexiness, and you definitely don't win any points in class for unironic sexism (and ironic sexism is losing it's charm as well).  The first thing your teacher is going to say is, ""Pitch me the game of this sketch."" It looks to me like it's something like ""Treating public bathroom urination like a sports championship"". If that's not what's in your head, I would advise you to write out - as succinctly as possible - what you think the game is. Then cut everything that doesn't directly hit that game. For example, the awkwardness up top - does that have anything to do with urination being like a sports championship? No. Instead, you might open it with one of the announcers talking about what a beautiful day for urination it is, or whatever. There's absolutely no reason not to jump right into the game."

Screenwriting,3ctpa6,slupo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:36:01 2015 UTC,"I would vote for this method.  Except I would tweak the Flashback one to start with John as well.  As in:    JOHN My name is John.

Maybe something like ""NOTE: in flashbacks, so-and-so goes by 'What's-it-to-ya'""  Or, I bet that if you stick to one character name the whole time, but have people refer to him under another name solely in the flashbacks, it may be obvious enough to the reader that he goes by another name.  I once wrote a drama where one of my main characters ends up having an affair with his high school sweetheart, who is mentioned in the first act of the script, and the affair isn't revealed until later. Anyway, the character involved in the affair has one name until it is revealed (at the same time the affair is revealed) she goes by her middle name instead of her first name. So I essentially wrote it along the lines of ""Mary, who is now known as PAM, blah blah blah"". And then referred to her as Pam for the rest of the script. Maybe you could stick with one name throughout the whole script, or switch back and forth as you switch from present time to flashbacks, but that may get confusing for the reader."

Screenwriting,3ctxb8,MachineGunCaveman,-4,Sat Jul 11 02:46:05 2015 UTC,"I start by imagining a crayon-written script that is inarguably brilliant. It's brilliance will communicate, but only if it is read. Then I imagine the obstacles it'll face: 1) it's appearance might get it dismissed without being read at all. 2) It may get read, but it's appearance might prejudice a reader to the point that they become irrationally blind to it's beauty and power.  Owing to this, the person who read the script with an open mind would be a special kind of person, and more open-minded than the ones who ignored it or couldn't see the material past the cosmetic flaws.  Your response puzzled me. I didn't understand why you had that reaction. I was blind, I couldn't empathize, and I hate when that happens.  You're so certain of your point, that it colors your imagination. You believe that a crayon script could theoretically sell (and you're right), but you're so sure of it that you can't usefully imagine the kind of person that wouldn't totally agree with your point of view.  This is a blind spot in your imagination and empathy. When I imagine the success of the crayon script, I need to imagine a plausible way past those obstacles. You legitimately can't see them in your minds eye. I'm not sure if you believe those obstacles exist. You don't value the person who sees past flaws as special because you think that's how everyone is.   They're not. I wish we lived in that world, it's certainly how they ought to be, but people who can truly see past the surface are special and rare. I don't know if you believe yourself to be that kind of person.

I was born in 1984 in Seoul, South Korea. I was raised in Vergennes, Vermont, the smallest city in the United States. I had loving parents, but I was a basically lonely child because my people skills, frankly, suck.  I always loved the movies. Ever since I was 15, I dreamed of being a screenwriter. I moved to LA at 18, with dreams of finding a secret club full of awesome people who would recognize me as one of them and make me cool. I didn't. Those clubs probably existed, but as I've said before, my people skills sucked.  I got lucky at 23 and sold a screenplay. I've sold some other ones, which I will forever be profoundly grateful for.  I started teaching screenwriting at around 26, when my career was in a low point. I started on /r/screenwriting because I love reddit. This can be a rough place. It's a room full of passionate, smart people who genuinely seem to love screenwriting. As a result of that passion, differences of opinion can turn into flame wars.  It's entirely possible that I'm not all there in the head, but what good would pointing it out do? Would I say, ""You got me, I'm mad as a hatter?"" Possibly, but not probably. What's more likely is that I'd get hostile and defensive and write you off.  I don't want to write you off. I've done enough of that in my life (again, shitty people skills). I certainly don't want to surround myself with people who tell me I'm great.  What I would like to do is talk. If I'm wrong, I'd like to know. If we're both right, I'd like to learn what I can from you to become better at screenwriting. We're both English-speaking redditors who are passionate about screenwriting. We probably have more in common than we don't.  So, rather than go to my usual quill of unhelpful sarcasm that has made me feel good in the moment, but has robbed me of dozens if not hundreds of potential friends, I'm telling you a little about myself. I posted the image because I thought it would be fun and amusing, feedback from the thread suggests that it's not, and I will adjust my posts accordingly.  While you've got my attention, is there anything helpful about screenwriting that you can tell me that you feel might really help me be a better, more rounded creative and person?"

It’s not a situation where the writer is going off and writing and turns in a draft in six weeks or eight weeks or whatever. They are embedded with us. They have an office in our building and they’re working every single day in the story room with the directors. So they need to be extremely collaborative, they need to be very flexible, they need to be fast, and they need to have emotion.”  “It’s also important to not have a prickly personality.

Here, I'll give you an absurd example to show you what I mean.   A man with a paralyzing fear of platypuses must come to terms with his bizarre phobia to rescue his disabled son from a subterranean kingdom of intelligent and bloodthirsty platypuses.   Sure, it's ridiculous, but you know what the central struggle is. Notice it's an external struggle that helps bring out the internal struggle.

You've set up an oblique goal (don't go crazy) and some roundabout stakes (losing his kid, I guess?), but no urgency. What's the deadline by which he has to be sane instead of insane? You can't effectively structure a traditional story without knowing the timeline on which interesting shit has to happen.

When they get home at night and look at all the scripts on their list, a successful logline will make them go ""oh yea! I wanted to read this one.""

Murder? Dressing up as their age and befriending them?   A lonely landlord must save his shopping center from a gang of teens by fucking their moms on camera for blackmail.   Suddenly you can imagine the movie as a dark comedy, and the lonely landlord falls in love with one of the mom', and this generation's Sean William Scott will be one of the douchebag teens. It is suddenly a MOVIE.   A man must save his wife from giving birth to the anti-christ.   HOWWWWWWW? Is this a horror, or a comedy? As a comedy writer myself:   A man must save his wife from giving birth to the anti-christ by getting the Pope to bless his penis.   I'm now imagining it as a buddy comedy with Will Forte as the husband and Sir Patrick Steward playing the Pope. Mila Kunis plays the wife and Anthony Jeselnik plays the Devil.

Screenwriting,3cpd3i,HotspurJr,3,Thu Jul 9 20:25:05 2015 UTC,"It honestly doesn't matter that much. Personally I try to minimize technical directions, because I think it reads better, so I would say that whatever takes up the least space is the best way to go.   If every scene is a continuous take, I'd write that once and be done with it. Essentially, my personal opinion is that the vast majority of camera directions are distracting and hurt the read EVEN if the underlying idea is a good one. (And in my opinion, the vast majority of the ones I read are not good ones.)  With anything like this, though, let go of the notion that there is ""ONE CORECT WAY TO DO THIS AND IF YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE YOUR SCRIPT WILL BE TOSSED ASIDE!"" That's a fear a lot of young writers have, and it's misguided.   Honestly, it just doesn't matter very much so long as you are clear, concise, and not otherwise hurting the read."

However, if you're creative enough, you can write the scene in a way that implies that it's one shot.  The only problem with this is, if it's not necessary to the plot, there's no reason to include it written into the scene, either, because a director is going to film it how he or she wants.  They don't want to read your directions, just like an actor doesn't want anyone telling them how to play their character.  A reader will just be distracted from the story if they have to read about shots, etc.  It's just better spec writing to concentrate on the story itself.

Screenwriting,3cr81f,Bizarro_Bacon,3,Fri Jul 10 03:11:23 2015 UTC,"Short answer, yes. we tend to do what is easy which in this case is loading up on CGI. It's no longer practical to use practical effects. Long answer: On the other hand we remember old action movies like T2 or Die Hard because they included those beats filled with humanity. There are plenty of old action films that missed that mark. Remember Street Fighter? Or the Robocop sequels? Good filmmakers still make great action films (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, The Raid 1 and 2, John Wick) and there are even visual effects laden films that work fantastically. I think in Marvel we find a great micro example: The Thor films (especially Dark World) and Guardians of the Galaxy. While both stories have flaws (villains, villains, villains) they both rely incredibly on CGI. When each film works it is because (spoilers, duh) we care that Thor, and more potently Loki, are affected by the death of their mother, or that we believe Peter Quill and his band of misfits would stop bad things from happening because they know that pain. Meanwhile it's why the Expendables movies suck. There's nothing relatable about beafed up men who have no ties to the world and are therefore expendable. So yes and no, CGI creates huge opportunities for cheating away from having to create personal characters, but in other ways it can serve to enhance a visual experience around relatable characters. I don't think the problem is with CGI. I think shitty filmmakers gonna shitty (Michael Bay, Roland Emmerich, Uwe Bol), regardless of the tools at their disposal."

Likewise there's no rule saying I can't request more Pixar and how to train your dragons and less teenage mutant ninja turtles.  Now that I'm done straddling the fence I do submit that there are objective criteria for a bad film. Laziness comes to mind. Also a lack of direction (meaning no distinct point of view). Poorly choreographed fight scenes are pretty evident regardless of whether or not a person enjoys a film, for example. Box office is also representative, generally (though not in all cases) films that appeal to the parents as well as the kids make more money. I don't think dumbing a movie down for the kids is an excuse."

Screenwriting,3cr81f,poseymund,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:38:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I can see the logic of this argument.  Explosions in action films were extremely popular in 1991, when T2 was released.  If your logic was correct, it would be ""In 1991, special effects and large explosions have taken the place of raw emotions.""   Yet in that era of FX and cheap explosions - the emotion of the scenes in T2 gripped you.  I don't have that emotional connection to that scene ... for me it was this explosion in Aliens that had the emotion:      Beyond is a narrow SERVICE WAY, lined with pipes and     conduit.  Hicks slides through the searing hole,     lifting Newt safely through as Ripley hands her out.     Ripley follows and turns to help Gorman.  Vasquez'     flamethrower goes dry.  She draws her SERVICE PISTOL.     Suddenly she looks up as a WARRIOR SCREECHES DOWN FROM     A VERTICAL SHAFT, right above her.      She fires with incredible rapidity...BAM!  BAM!  BAM!     Rolls aside.  It lands on her legs and she snaps her head     to one side just as its TAIL STINGER buries into the     metal wall beside her cheek.  She fires again, emptying     the pistol, kicking the thrashing shape away.      Acid cuts through her chickenplate armor, searing into     her thigh.  She cries out, gritting her teeth against     the white-hot pain.  Gorman sees Vasquez hit, unable to     move.  Sees the creatures coming the other way...and     turns away from the escape hole.  He crawls back to her,     grabs her battle harness and starts dragging her towards     safety.  Too late.  The approaching alien warriors have     reached and passed the opening.  Vasquez sees him,     barely conscious.                                VASQUEZ                       (hoarse whisper)                You always were an asshole, Gorman.      She seizes his hand in a deadly drip, but we RECOGNIZE     it as the ""power greeting"" she shared with Drake...     something for the chosen few.  Gorman returns the grip.     He hands her two grenades and arms two himself as the     creatures are upon them.   That was an FX ladened scene which ended in Gorman & Vasquez dying in an explosion - which is, according to your argument, the worst combination.  But, for me anyway, it was the most raw and personal death scene imaginable.  -- Mac"

We know what's happening in the industry, we know what movies we're excited about, we know what's coming out.  Most people don't know what's currently in cinemas, unless it's something huge. Most people, and that's by a pretty huge majority, don't know what they're going to see before they get to the cinema. They show up, look at the posters and decide then.   I think they make just as many good movies today that they did 10 years ago or 20 years ago. We don't really remember a lot of the bad ones, and we still get amazing movies."
Screenwriting,3cr81f,simon2it,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:02:37 2015 UTC,"I am dependent on VFX for my livelihood at the moment (VFX editor), but I certainly understand OP's frustration. Here's my two cents:  First of all, I'm gonna be that guy and correct you on how you're using the term 'special effects.' Not because I'm a pedantic asshole (not just because of that anyway) but because a lot of people get this wrong and if you want to work in film you should learn the correct terms. Visual FX and Special FX are totally different departments. Special FX are on set, creating and photographing practical effects such as physical creatures, real explosives. Visual FX alter the image after the fact, with CGI, compositing etc. The truck flipping shot from The Dark Knight had both kinds: The real wires flipping the real truck were Special FX, and VFX painted out those wires.  Okay, now that that's out of the way, to actually contribute to this discussion.  Something I have learned working in VFX is that, of all the many moving parts that go into making a movie, VFX is one of the worst-understood by everyone else in the business. Many people in the industry with decision-making (and money-giving) power have only a tenuous grasp on what VFX requires in terms of money, time, and, maybe most importantly, planning. Sometimes it feels like producers and directors think there is a magic ""add alien"" button. That anything is possible. And to some extent that's true: given enough time and money, computers allow us to put anything you can imagine into your movie. But that doesn't mean that you should put anything you can imagine into your movie.  I think great FX-spectacle movies of the past (e.g. Jaws, Alien(s), Star Wars) hold up in large part because the directors knew that they had to be smart about lighting, composition, editing (you know, just the craft of filmmaking, no biggie). They had to focus on their characters' emotional reactions to sell the spectacle, instead of just presenting the spectacle. And some CGI-heavy movies like Jurassic Park and T2 hold up because obviously Spielberg and Cameron came from that earlier world where you had to plan and be artful. And I think the best spectacle movies still do that. But it's much easier nowadays for an inexperienced director to say ""yeah screw it, we'll just add some aliens in post"" and not plan at all.  Anyway, that's my thoughts."

They cause untold problems with continuity for the rest of your character roster. How can a universe with aliens and science exist when Zeus can pop up any time? It makes no sense! And what about all the gods from other cultures? When are we getting the great Caterpillar of the Aborigines or a Taoist Immortal popping up? It's wrong, wrong, wrong and you only have to read through a wiki article attempting to explain the ridiculous, tortuous paths taken by these heroes as the writers flail about trying to fit them in to a coherent narrative with the rest of the universe.  And breathe - phew, thanks for that."
Screenwriting,3cp0fi,Penrose88,2,Fri Jul 10 14:03:56 2015 UTC,"Haha, that was a good rant. I definitely agree with you on the overpowered issue, it's why I dislike Superman. I've been told that it's not about the risk to him, it's about the people he fails to save. The stories all end with him in a brawl though.  The uncontrolled nature of superhero powers is what really makes me dislike the genre. I think people like Brandon Sanderson are heroes for working with limited magic systems. It makes magic interesting, and builds a rapport with the characters as they work things out. In a way the books are mysteries because rules are seeded throughout and we work out how the protagonists will escape using that framework.  Compare to Iron Man; armour that provides inconsistent protection, batteries that last as the plot requires. Thor; completely invulnerable for no reason, magic hammer that can somehow resist being picked up. And so on.    A good point about the Jesus thing. I don't know that hammers are as symbolic as the cross is? But it would certainly be shocking to see him appropriated like that.  I was under the impression that Thor is just an alien, aren't all the Marvel 'Gods' the same way?  You're skirting around telling us who you're writing about, any reason? :)"

I really enjoyed it and thought it was pretty funny too. Just some random thoughts:   The start is meant to be a cheap TV advert. Possibly it would be good to mention this, otherwise it seems like you are trying to describe the camera movements of the movie (which is usually a big no-no.) You don't get the sense immediately that it's an advert so it seems weird, why is this guy standing behind the cash register and shouting?! Who's he talking to etc. Bob, Johnson and Mr Greggs seem like good characters because there's something distinctive about them and their behaviour. The same can't really be said about Dane and Rosie. The other thing we know about Rosie is she's a woman who is good at her job. Dane doesn't seem to have much to him either."

I mean, a lot of producers/decision makers are never going to see the second half of our scripts.  A page with a great first 10 pages and 90 terrible pages after that is going to get more reads than a masterpiece with a shit opening.

A story is not told in the first page and the opening scene of movies are not one page.  Again, I don't know which script you wrote, but only two of the scripts actually read like a feature.  The rest were clearly contrived to end on cliff hangers which is what a one page, or 10 page or 30 page competition will inherently breed.    I am afraid I am coming off as bitter, I am not.

Are they wearing contemporary suits and dresses or period costume? Lanterns typically aren't used to keep people warm, but if you really want them to have lanterns, are they gas lanterns? Candle lanterns? I have no idea if it's 2015 or 1615.  After the Hierophant's first block of dialogue, you refer to him as ""the priest"". Keep the naming consistent.  Also, I might add another scene heading (EXT. STONE ALTAR - EARLY MORNING) at the beginning, right before ""Seen from above...""  Keep it up!

I wonder what other people have to say.  I feel like some of your description could be polished a little. I'm sure there's a better way to say:   We’re sitting on a chair surrounded by peeling, water-stained wallpaper and decrepit furniture.   Perhaps just me but I put the wallpaper on the floor around the chair rather than on the walls, where I'm sure you intend it to be.  Also,    A wire is protruding out of his left temple which runs across the floor, up our body and into the side of our head.   Suggests that we're still POV but I don't think it would be easy to film, and I naturally pull out of POV with the description you're giving.

Being honest, I also had trouble with a few words, which made me have to slow down and think, which made the read slower instead of crisp for me.  I first pictured two snakes grooving through the desert (dancing snakes??), and then I realized that they were grooves snaking, not snakes grooving.  I also had trouble with ""two hearts"", ""dusters"", and ""chaw"", as those aren't familiar to me.  But to someone in the genre, they may make sense.    I'd suggest switching the beginning to a more active voice, i.e. start with the cowboys dragging the body as the focus, not looking at the result of the dragging.  But, that's just a suggestion."

The air warps and waves under the intensifying heat."" -- that felt a little wordy to me, and I'm not sure how to envision the air warping.  Bottom line to me is that the sun's up. :)    Are Paz and Sarah both female?  I'm not sure which gender Paz is usually associated with.    Overall, I liked the mood that was presented.

One of my favourite games in Silent Hill 2, which has an amazing story...but the writing and the dialogue can be ear bleeding at times too.

The whole 'trying to hide his Scottish accent' thing isn't something most people will pick up on just from the sound of his voice. If you want the audience to know he's attempting to hide his accent, we need to see him actively practicing that or you could explain it in a line of dialogue.  The dialogue is a bit stiff, kind of literary. It doesn't sound like real people talking. This might be something you were going for, though, so I won't count this as a negative.

Screenwriting,3ckm2r,poseymund,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:56:32 2015 UTC,"A structural trend I've noticed on many of the entries here (perhaps because they've been edited slightly for this competition):  A set-up (maybe solid, maybe flimsy), followed by a ""punchline,"" i.e. a twist at the very end of the page to ""hook your reader.""  If you have that naturally, great. But if you're doctoring your first page to try and do that, it's just a gimmick. I think this competition is making people miss the point of a first page. Which is just to be the first page of your great script, not to ""hook"" the reader. If someone's going to judge your entire script by the first page instead of the first 5 or 10, you're probably screwed anyway.

Screenwriting,3ckm2r,er1339,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:36:09 2015 UTC,"After reading a bunch of these, the only thing that is consistent across the board is that the first page tells you pretty much nothing about the actual script or story. And the best you can do in terms of character is exactly what I'm talking about: a punchline. You can't do real character development on page one, you can only do caricature.  When I was a script reader, if I had told my boss that I stopped threw out a script because the first page didn't ""hook"" me, she would've laughed me out the building and taken my keys.   The only thing you should really be worried about on page one is showing that you're a good technical writer. No typos, no spelling or grammar mistakes, and no broken formatting rules. Beyond that, a reader can't get anything useful out of one page."

I may be wrong on 1/10 scripts that have a poorly written opening line, but I'm very confident that if I'm going to read 100 scripts, the likelihood of me finding a great one is significantly higher if I just ignore all the scripts with first pages that don't draw me in."

And it invites a terrible way to approach script-writing. Which is to rush. If you rush to ""the good stuff,"" you lose the real good stuff. Put plot and punchline before story and character and you've got yourself a top-notch B film, and nothing more."
Screenwriting,3ckm2r,2drums1cymbal,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:58:05 2015 UTC,"I think we're talking across purposes. I am not advocating punchlines on the first page. I am advocating good writing from moment one. Look at the big fish script, which I always cite for great writing from the first line. There are no gimmicks, but the writing hooks you immediately. I don't see how that's a bad thing. I'm not saying you need something crazy on the first page to hook people."
Screenwriting,3ckm2r,humblewatertribe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:29:41 2015 UTC,"No, no, I don't think YOU are saying or advocating that! But I am worried this competition is pushing people to do things along those lines in an effort to ""stand out"" and I think in terms of big picture, that's not good for the whole script. If you write your first page like that, you can put yourself in a difficult position where you have to explain resolve your original punchline AND move the story forward toward the actual inciting incident and plot points and such at the same time. Which can over-complicate the screenplay very quickly!"
Screenwriting,3ckm2r,magelanz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:40:15 2015 UTC,"Totally hear you on that. Since votes are now private we can't see who's leading to get into the judges round, but once there the judges shouldn't be more favorable to a script just because it hits a nice beat on page 1. :-)"
Screenwriting,3ckm2r,lordpond,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:11:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, I feel like it's hard to judge the merit of the page because there's so little context. But maybe that's the point. People aren't providing enough context.   I have a theory that people are getting things the wrong way round. If there's going to be a hook, it should come immediately, not at the end. The setting needs to be established. There are a lot of people jumping straight into dialogue with little set up. That doesn't often happen in produced scripts. Usually there's some strong imagery or a voiceover, and they're intended to quickly establish what's going on."
Screenwriting,3ckm2r,magelanz,2,Fri Jul 10 21:24:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like this competition is just prompting people to think that if they surprise the reader enough, they've sufficiently hooked them. The problem with trying to hook people on the first page is that you can't do it. You need solid characters and a coherent set-up to really get a reader interested, neither of which can be done in one page, let alone both!"
Screenwriting,3cop8q,Krinks1,2,Thu Jul 9 15:28:49 2015 UTC,"Okay.  This is a little long for what it accomplishes. I'm not so worried about the description of the dude or the room (although if a guy has an ""average build"" why do you have to mention it?).  I have two bigger problems with the scene:  First, this is a lot of typing and reading. Even phone calls are uncinematic compared to in-person conversations, and chat discussions are worse.  I would try to find a way to get that information across.  Secondly, this scene doesn't really introduce his character. Character is revealed by choices under pressure, and I haven't seen any. Idle chit-chat isn't dramatically interesting. Can you find a way to get him to react to something that shows us how unique he is, because right now, I'm not seeing it."

No pizza box unless it's going catch fire later.  Unless the computer and Vyper are speaking aloud, you don't format that as dialogue.   Get right into the story.    At the end - why would be unsure what he wants to do?  Is he contemplating a phone call vs an email?  Why would he suddenly call and not email? And why is he talking like that? Why isn't he saying, ""Hells yeah, you know I'm interested, whatcha got?"" And why is the professor giving the provenance of the puzzle right here?  Why not just - ""Came across a new puzzle, no luck solving, you want to take a stab?""   Every line you write is an opportunity to reveal character or establish tone.

If you like working with  a corkboard/index card model, it's a godsend. Much more powerful for the planning phase than any of the traditional screenwriting software.  It does have a script mode that I find perfectly usable, but even they say that the final push is best done in a dedicated package. You can export to .fdx and .fountain, which will both import into WriterDuet, which is a great online (free) and offline (one-off purchase) solution."

I love sliding things around making notes upon notes.  It's like working with a cork board and a notebook at the same time.  The screenwriting mode leaves a lot to be desired but when you're done with with that first draft you could push it out to almost any program.  Good luck!"

Fade In only costs 50 dollars. Final draft is way more.  Fade In is consistently updated for free. Final Draft only has updates once in a while and it costs something like around 99 dollars for the new version if you bought the old one.  I think Final Draft is coasting on its reputation. I figure if Fade In is good enough for the next Star Wars movies it's good enough for me. :) :)

Lisa Prescott, the last woman alive after a violent plague, is a fugitive for refusing government pressure to have children. Guarded by a handful of traitorous soldiers, all vying for her love, she searches for sanctuary while  fighting zombies.   I don't get it.

That being said, while speed is important for a pro, worrying about it is probably counterproductive when you're relatively inexperienced.   I mean, if you can focus and write well for only an hour a day, then you're not doing yourself any favors by writing for two hours a day. Until you're at least close to being a pro, focus on quality. It takes as long as it takes.   That being said, people have more and better progress when they work more consistently.

Screenwriting,3cn5cc,RollingPicturesMedia,2,Thu Jul 9 05:03:29 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion as an amateur and nothing more, and I only gave it 10 pages due to time commitments.  The intro is a little confusing to me. If you gave the characters names and described the scene a bit more it might not be. I'm assuming they're all standing around the egg but I can't be sure. Plus the mud splatters across the third girl's face despite her never being mentioned before in the script. So she abruptly appears out of nowhere? I don't think a couple more sentences about the situation would hurt. Or even removed half of the children as really what is the difference between 2 and 5 kids looking at an egg?  If you don't already you should read aloud your dialogue as some of it seems quite unnatural. I feel like the characters say too much despite the moment they're in. For example when Brian stands up and says ""Are you really going to subject these people to more of your banality?"" then the barista comes over and says ""Sir. I’m going to have to ask you to sit down. There is no reason to be rude to our guest."" To me this seems too long winded and unnatural. Especially for people that are in a public setting. I just can't imagine anybody standing up and interrupting somebody like that. Wouldn't something like shouting ""Shittttttt! Shittttt!"" be more of a natural way to start that little argument?  Likewise the conversation between Katherine and Brian seems unnatural. They've just met each other and suddenly plunge into a conversation about everything while walking down the street. (Then Katherine randomly drives off...did she just so happen to finish work at the exact same time Brian decided to heckle the poet?) Couldn't they just have this conversation in the doorway? Wouldn't it be a little more abrupt and guarded since they're basically strangers. Or would there be some lead in to that conversation."

It's important to me that the kid throw the rock on the bird in front of a group of kids and not just one other person.  Also, I come back to this scene later, and that recall is clarified more.  Him standing up and interrupting is part his having no respect for other and him being drunk.  That said, just from your response, I think I see a better way to start all that, so I'll rework it a little bit.  When Katherine leaves, it was my intention that she just happened to be finishing work, but now that you've made me think about that a little deeper, I think a better solution would be to have her kind of send him on his way while she goes back to the event.    Finally, the think about them just plunging into conversation works fro me in general, because in my real world experience, I've had situations very similar to this.  I don't know if it's just where I'm from or what, but I've jumped into semi-deep conversations with strangers many times.  That said, I could probably add a line or two to ease it in a little more.  Thanks so much for taking the time you had and for your helpful comments.  I hope you find time to finish the rest later."

Screenwriting,3cl7rq,PM_ME_YOUR_BODYPART_,5,Wed Jul 8 19:49:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm not sure how valuable film school is at the undergraduate level. I went to USC for grad school, and got a lot out of it (although I don't think it's for everyone), but most USC professors would tell you to go get the best liberal arts degree you can get, and then go to film school for graduate school.  I think that's probably good advice.   I would, however, seriously consider theater as an undergrad. There are a lot of practical advantages to that, and, heck, if I was doing college again I'd definitely spend more time in that department. Getting stuff in front of audiences is really important to your development, and by acting/writing/directing theater you'll learn a tremendous amount that helps your later filmmaking aspirations."
Screenwriting,3cl7rq,HotspurJr,3,Wed Jul 8 19:56:09 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in writing, you can't go wrong finding a school with good English and Cinema Studies departments. I've taken two screenwriting classes, and honestly, you don't really need any more than that. The benefit of the English major is you'll be exposed to a ton of great literature, material from which you can endlessly draw for screenwriting. If you're not interested in English, then the Cinema Studies dept. will definitely help you get moving towards screenwriting. You'll learn the history of film and perform in-depth analysis of films, past and present.  If you really want to become a good screenwriter, then do these three things: read scripts, watch movies, and write."
Screenwriting,3cl7rq,bonoohno,2,Wed Jul 8 20:01:52 2015 UTC,"Will second the English degree. That was my major, and although I'm just now wading into screenwriting (two complete scripts, two shorts, and currently working on a TV pilot), I've made my living as a writer for more than 25 years.  The benefit of studying literature is A) you'll absorb SO MUCH about storytelling, plotting, structure, etc., B) you'll have to write a lot of critical essays that will make you think SO MUCH about storytelling, plotting, structure, etc., C) you'll become a super disciplined writer.   I learned screenwriting format in an adult ed night class for $120, and there are lots of books and online resources that can be very helpful. If you're more interested in screenwriting than filmmaking, the English major will probably help you out a lot more than film school will.  But yes, also watch and study lots of films. Not just the kind you want to write, but all different genres and eras. There's something to learn from all of them. Good luck to you!"

(But all jobs I did while trying to break into writing. Hey, they were honest work and kept me fed.)   Actually, these days, with so much self-publishing going on with ebooks, I know a lot of English majors who are now freelance editors and proofreaders and doing very well. Other English majors I know have gone into copywriting for advertising agencies, working for newspapers and magazines or ezines, they've gone on to law school, or are teaching.   And I've been doing a lot of reading lately about job prospects for college grads (my son is about to start his senior year of college), and I've been seriously impressed with how much emphasis employers now are putting on skills like communication and articulation, in addition to having a solid work history. It's becoming less and less important what college you attend or how good your grades were or even what you majored in. Nowadays, employers want hard workers with good communication skills. And an English degree will definitely provide you with that last."
Screenwriting,3cl7rq,HotspurJr,2,Wed Jul 8 21:54:54 2015 UTC,"Most people with liberal arts majors don't end up doing something exactly in the field they studied. It's not that big a deal.  If you security and employment, study tech. Learn how to code. I have friends who do recruiting in tech and experienced Ruby on Rails engineers are fielding 50 emails a week offering six-figure jobs. Obviously in six years it won't be Ruby on Rails, it'll be something else, but coding is probably the most important skill for the 21st century economy.

I know people like to talk about how you can replace film school with commentaries and books on screenwriting, but film school and screenwriting programs aren't just about learning fundamentals. It's also about putting yourself in an environment where you're surrounded by people with similar interests and different views. It's about going through college and actually learning something because you're genuinely passionate about what you're studying. If you're going to college, you're going to get way more out of four years of screenwriting than you will out of four years of something you're just vaguely interested in. Whatever you do, don't not apply to a screenwriting program just because you're concerned it's not practical, because you will know a lot more about what you really want when you have that acceptance letter in your hand."

The numbers were close. He also posted about 25% were paid money last year writing features (something like that). The takeaway is, even if you're a WGA member, it's difficult to find work and difficult to keep getting paid as a writer.  You are far better off, going to university and getting a ""regular degree at a regular school"" and studying film/writing screenplays on the side. Use your 4 years, getting a degree in something unrelated, and spend those 4 years writing spec scripts, hopefully at 3-4 a year. Come out of school with a degree and 12-16 specs.  Then move to L.A. and go for it."
Screenwriting,3cl7rq,whoizz,2,Thu Jul 9 03:36:50 2015 UTC,"This is the best answer here. I would like to add that you might be very well off just taking a year and working random jobs around the country. Travel and gain some life experiences. Meet some weird people. Go to a dive bar and start a fight with a guy named Gus. Get someone's life story while your sitting a bus stop in Wichita, while drinking forties out of a paper bag. Enrich yo' self."
Screenwriting,3cl7rq,k8powers,2,Thu Jul 9 13:49:17 2015 UTC,"Agree with all the other advice here. Whether you want to work in features or television, sooner or later you're going to sit down with somebody who's thinking of hiring you. You can always talk to that person about the movies you love, or the directors you admire, but so will everyone else. The people who stand out are the ones who can talk about training as an EMT and working as a paramedic part-time to put themselves through school or who studied abroad in China or cleaned carpets for two years after failing out their sophomore year. As always, I have add my usual compulsive note that  if you are in the U.S., you should not, under any circumstances, accept privately funded student loans to pay for college. You need to not be bankrupt when you graduate so you can start taking grunt jobs and paying your dues. Federally funded loans have income-based repayment schemes that will make it possible for you to eat AND work as an assistant at an agency.  The only exception to this -- and I kinda don't think it applies or you would have said so in your post -- is if you're already feeling pulled towards a specific craft, like cinematography, editing, sound, vfx. In that case, yes, a BFA in production at USC or NYU will serve you extremely well. You'll still make $10/hr for the first three years after you graduate, but then you'll be on your way to be a full-blown member of whichever union manages your field.   Do you listen to the Scriptnotes podcast? This week's interview with Alec Berg (Silicon Valley) makes it clear that he didn't even think of writing for film or TV until he was already in college. Granted, he was at Harvard and the Lampoon is one of the greatest comedy training grounds on earth, but still... it's not necessary to obsess about every detail of your career from the get go."
Screenwriting,3cl7rq,ArchieChoseVeronica,2,Thu Jul 9 05:00:54 2015 UTC,"I know everyone is disagreeing, but I vote go to film school. However, only if you have the means to do so.  It gets expensive.   I go to film school and I fucking love it. Why would you want to be getting a degree in anything else other than what you want to do? My homework is watching movies and writing movies. I get graded on editing and sound design. That's a way better deal than writing a research paper or studying calculous. I do what I love every day. I have 3 short films under my belt because of it, which I could have done outside of school, but they wouldn't have been nearly as quality.   I'm aware that it won't propel me directly into the film industry, but neither would going to a general college.   As for choosing a specific study, like film or television, I don't think you're going to find any undergraduate schools with anything that specific. Most films schools kinda force you to dabble in everything, even if you think you have an idea of what you want to do.  After you graduate, if you have the means to go to grad school, then I would get specific."
Screenwriting,3cl7rq,danceswithronin,2,Thu Jul 9 22:14:18 2015 UTC,"Pretty much everything you need to learn about setting up a screenplay you can learn from books. Checking out the writing section of your local bookstore and you should be able to find screenwriting-specific reference guides that will teach you more about the screenwriting process (and much more cheaply) than screenwriting classes would.  My advice as a fellow creative who has worked both inside and outside of the writing field? Get a degree (or even a technical certification) where you can be ensured a stable well-paying job, and then write on the side until you break out (at which point you can abandon your day job). The idea of the starving artist is romantic but having gone down that route personally, it's uncomfortable and impractical as fuck for most peoples' situations.   Being a writer requires zero degrees. Don't pay for a college degree you don't need and that won't qualify you for anything but a job as a barista or store clerk. The student loan debt is NOT worth it."
Screenwriting,3cl7rq,latenightrage,3,Wed Jul 8 20:05:07 2015 UTC,"I second this. As someone who majored in screenwriting, I can say that it definitely puts you at a higher skill level, but if you're vigilant, you can get there on your own at a much lower cost. Also, screenwriting classes offer a lot in terms of peer critique and such, but again, you can find people to read your screenplays without taking a class. Even if you have to pay for a professional read now and then, it's still cheaper than school."
Screenwriting,3cl7rq,danceswithronin,2,Wed Jul 8 21:54:21 2015 UTC,"As someone who has been in up writing classes (double major in English Lit and editing), peer critique at the university level is kind of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it's usually the first exposure to a workshop environment most folks get, and that teaches people a lot. On the other hand, those kinds of environments can also be filled with some pretty neurotic and/or creatively toxic folks whose advice you need to take with a generous dash of salt, as all of them are chiefly concerned with the success of their own work, and many view other writers as competition, rather than allies.   There's a reason most postmodern literary fic that comes out of college campuses sounds like the same pretentious overblown ""experimental"" bullshit. Those writers are all chilling out in the same insular ivory tower, and it does affect the quality and subject matter of their writing."

Screenwriting,3cl7rq,CutShortOnReddit,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:57:42 2015 UTC,"I wish I had this advice column when I was choosing my Uni.   My 2 cents:   I opted for a 4-year university instead of film school. Mostly from ignorance on how to choose a school. I got an English Degree specializing in 19th Century Poetry and 16th Century Restoration Theatre, with a few Screenwriting and Creative Writing classes in between. Most of the screenwriting I learned on my own. I also studied theatre and read a lot of old writers. I'm a self-taught editor and now work as a freelancer in branding and marketing. I run a small production company on the side and after 6 shorts we're developing our first feature. Granted my route is unorthodox and is coming from a writers perspective but the overall idea is that you should really ask yourself what you truly want and then pursue that now.  Any technical field such as Directing, Cinematography, Editing, Sound, VFX, you'll definitely need a dedicated film school. Also in film, it's who you know and who knows you. Film schools are great for building contacts. Another piece of advice is intern early and intern a lot. If you're gonna go down the writers path then start writing right now. Write every day. Read every day. Learn how to tell a story. Screenwriting is 90% story telling and 10% formatting. Also read some books on acting to see how actors build characters, specifically about the Meisner and Chekov technique. If you go down the route of a cinematographer or director. Go get a shitty camera. Start shooting stuff. Hell use your phone. Those cameras are amazing. Experience is the best teacher I've ever found. Embrace it.   Hope this helps and best of luck."

It's definitely useful, but it's also very expensive for a quality film education. If you are driven to pursue this then start writing and learn through doing it. Getting a degree in another field would be more helpful to screenwriting because it will give you a different perspective from the scores of screenwriters who spend all their time studying screenwriting. For example, if you get a degree in astrophysics you have a lot more authority and inspiration to write realistic science fiction than someone who doesn't."

I'm airing this (very picky) complaint publicly not to call you out or whatever, but so that we can see if others agree or if I'm just the asshole here.  The commercial to content rate feels a little high which I do not hold against you at all. You gotta pay for the awesome content & talent somehow, and if I had advertisers coming to my podcast, you can be damn sure there'd be commercial breaks. But one tiny thing you can do to improve the perceived pacing might be to skip the vocal intro and outros around the commercials.

Not just the overall conflict of the story, but smaller conflicts.  Whether it be tension between characters or characters having a dire time-sensitive goal, just about every scene had conflict (which is something I've personally struggled with).  I see your complaints, but...I feel like you're blaming the writer for writing flawed characters.  Stephanie goes along with it for as long as she does because she was scarred by her high school experience just like Lindsey was.  Howie is trusting of Devon -- to a fault -- because he longs for companionship as a result of constantly being shirked by Stephanie.  Just because these characters do things that you or I wouldn't do doesn't necessarily mean they don't make sense.  A final note: Paul Scheer and June Diane Raphael were phenomenal."

Screenwriting,3chjw2,BenJacoby,2,Wed Jul 8 15:15:39 2015 UTC,"Few are that long. The bigger the budget the longer, and the less known the team the longer.  Terminator was a big budget movie. And at the time Cameron was not heavily established. So it needed to be basically every piece of the movie ready to shoot.  For a microbudget movie you might be able to get away with 5-10 pages. Always though, the more complete the better."
Screenwriting,3chjw2,holomntn,4,Wed Jul 8 00:50:22 2015 UTC,Terminator wasn't a big budget movie... it was like 6 million.
Screenwriting,3chjw2,idiotdidntdoit,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:43:01 2015 UTC,$6 million puts it roughly mid pack for popular movies that year. That is the big budget area.

I think Back To The Future was considered sort of mid-range in the 80, ghostbusters had a $30 million budget.  I honestly think that Terminator was sort of considered a low-budget B-movie"
Screenwriting,3chjw2,idiotdidntdoit,0,Wed Jul 8 13:03:40 2015 UTC,"/u/holomntn is saying any studio movie qualifies as ""big budget."" When you consider that thousands of movies get made, but only a few hundred get released, you'll see that, from the crew's perspective, that's totally correct.   The cutoff between high and low budgets right now is, I believe, $5,000,000, according to above the line unions' MBAs. Can't imagine what it was in the mid-80s."

If you're writing a piece of fiction that requires a little research, a good goal would be to write a script from start to finish in three months. I say this because if you become a working professional, you'll need to learn how to write to a deadline. I often have to write a script in 6-8 weeks. If you're just starting out, try doing 2-3 scripts a year."

Screenwriting,3cl113,TadBitter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:45:22 2015 UTC,I usually spend 1-2 weeks on a revision. But my first drafts are usually close to ready to go out and are usually in shape to get a few reads from industry friends and my agent.
Screenwriting,3cl113,er1339,2,Fri Jul 10 05:05:48 2015 UTC,"Every script has its own timeline. The project I'm working now I thought of a couple weeks ago, spent some time outlining and fleshing out characters. Now I've been writing my ""zero draft"" (which is just me forcing myself to get through one pass of the whole thing) for a few days, and I'm on page 70. I'll probably finish the zero draft in a week or so, and then I'll let it sit for a while so I can approach it with fresh(ish) eyes, and revise the living hell out of it. All in all, I expect to have a relatively polished draft by the end of summer, and a finished draft by the end of the year. This project is moving along what I would call my ""ideal timeline"" for writing.  On the other hand, I have an idea that I've been grappling with for four years now. I'm still not yet satisfied with certain aspects of it, and my attempts to write it have all left me thoroughly disappointed. I still have faith that eventually I'll figure it out, probably by stitching together all the best ideas I've had for it over the past few years, but I've accepted that I can't rush it. This project is far from my ideal timeline, but I still love it and think that it will be worth it in the end. So I guess you should spend as much time as you think the idea is worth.  There's no ""right"" amount of time, but that said, I think 2-3 scripts a year (consistently) is a quite lofty goal. There definitely is merit in spending longer on the writing process. Though I would suggest that you don't get TOO caught up in pre-writing and worry much more about re-writing. Personally, I think re-writing should take up the vast majority of your time on any project. Like Hemingway said, first drafts are shit--and that's true no matter how much preparation you do."

It might technically be a beginning and an end with a middle in between, but it just isn't a real draft. The zero draft is like the shadow of an actual draft. It looks like an actual draft, but it doesn't have the substance.  A zero draft is for your eyes only. You then shape it, fix it, tweak it, prune it, and spit-shine it until it's actually a coherent, self-contained,  and fully-functional screenplay. THAT is your first draft. It's probably still pretty bad, frankly, but it is now at a stage where you can show it to other people and start to get feedback.  Then, of course, you rewrite until your fingers fall off and you hope the eighty-seventh draft is good enough to sell!"

The (short) answer is that it’s really risky to work hard, because then if you fail you can no longer say that you failed because you didn’t work hard. It’s a form of self-protection… Most of the psychological research on this is focused on why some kids don’t study for tests. If you get drunk the night before an exam instead of studying and you fail, then the problem is that you got drunk. If you do study and you fail, the problem is that you’re stupid — and stupid, for a student, is a death sentence. The point is that it is far more psychologically dangerous and difficult to prepare for a task than not to prepare.""  Malcolm Gladwell, From an interview with Bill Simmons.   It's a good article and I see the point and I think it's correct.  Years ago I knew this girl who got knocked up and I asked her in these days of Planned Parenthood free/cheap help, how was she not using contraceptives?  She (from a fairly fundie household) answered, ""Because I didn't want to think I was really doing it.""   This thing Gladwell and the article talk about, it seems to me, is another form of the ""I'm just doing it for fun..."" attitude so often expressed around here. People downvote me when I jump on this shit a lot of times, but I do it because these people have already decided to fail. I hate that. I want them to decide to win.  But what does winning look like?  A lot of what winning looks like is working your ass off because ""good enough isn't.""  A lot of it is knowing first efforts suck, which is why you keep learning and practicing and doing.   But to me, winning is about doing it really well. I can't really give a shit whether there's a career in screenwriting in my future. I can only be about being the best I can be. I can only be about myself writing this thing I think I nailed and later having the doubts - will everyone thinks it's stupid - and just deciding fuck 'em if they can't take a joke and being this writer I am because I can't be any other writer and I'd rather do this than any other thing.  But the bar has to be too high to reach.   And that's a good thing. People think it's bad but it's the best part of anything. Doing that is winning. Getting paid is just extra credit."
Screenwriting,3chxo3,wrytagain,3,Wed Jul 8 01:40:29 2015 UTC,"The concepts of success and failure are challenging because both are hard to define and largely defaults to ""am I getting paid"" as opposed to ""am I learning something"".   Here's a quote from author Lawrence Block: ""It's curious how many writers tend to expect instant gratification. We've barely rolled a sheet of paper into the typewriter than we expect to see our efforts on the best seller list.   It seems to me other artists are rather less impatient of tangible success. What painter expects to sell the first canvas he covers? More often than not he plans to paint over it once it's dried. What singer counts on being booked into Carnegie Hall the first day he hits a high note? Every other artistic career is assumed to have an extended and arduous period of study and apprenticeship, yet all too many writers think they ought to be able to write professionally on their first attempt, and mail off their first stories before the ink is dry.""   Think this hits it on the head. Doing anything well takes time.   For whatever reason the exception seems to be writer/directors. QT, James Cameron, Robert Rodriguez hadn't written a ton of material before they started making their own. That might have something to do with how long it takes to produce a film. In the amount of time it takes to make a movie a writer may have written two or three things. And all of them were willing to work in pastiche (and make others material their own). It's still not a fast process either way and filmmaking has a lot of built in checks and balances because of the amount of collaboration involved.   That's kind of the route I'm exploring at the moment. Shameless plug I suppose:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6BQFq2Ncvs  It took a significant amount of work to make something, which some would say is bad. It's pastiche and it won't make money but it's a success if only for the experience."

That said, I think I felt more for the Praptors than anyone else in the film -- besides the assistant. Her death was gratuitous and, honestly, undeserving IMO. Also, was too predictable too early relative to the actual sequence.

She's probably a micromanaging control freak herself. Kind of a ""this is what Howard's character might look like if Pratt was more of a push-over"" who tries to control every single facet of her fiance's life.  Like, borderline emotionally abusive.

His basic assessment is that:  1) it would have made more sense as  2) would have meant more to little girls around the world than boys, since we already have Chris Pratt's character and finally   3) it would have reduced/eliminated the criticism of Bryce Dallas Howard's character as there would have been other female leads in the movie that weren't so polarizing."
Screenwriting,3cg8ps,farmerfound,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:57:49 2015 UTC,"The boys' problem isn't that they're boys. It's that they have no personality, and serve no story purpose except to be plot devices and motivation for the actions of other characters. You could replace them both with the briefcase from pulp fiction and hardly know the difference.  While you'd get a better actor/actress balance, you wouldn't be fixing the core character problem.  Edit: Pulp Fiction briefcase...I'm going to run with that for a minute because it sounds like fun...  Instead of divorcing parents, we go with D'Onofrio. His character opens the movie on a helicopter. He's carrying a strange looking briefcase. D'Onofrio gets to the island and is met by the assistant who is taking him to meet Howard. They argue because D'Onofrio wants to go right out to see Pratt, but the assistant insists that he meet with Howard first.  D'Onofrio manages to lose the assistant while she's busy talking on her cellphone. We follow him through the park where we see the shark get eaten, then through the children's wing and the petting zoo. We follow him to a door marked ""employees only"", where his ID badge lets him through. He hops into a park jeep in a back-stage area, and drives down a road. At a fork he takes the path labeled ""Velociraptor paddock"". The other sign at the fork is very, very dirty and disused and says ""East Dock"".  At the Velociraptor paddock we get the exchange between D'Onofrio and Pratt that we saw in the movie. Pratt has the raptors trained, and D'Onofrio wants them for military applications. Pratt wins the argument a bit harder than in the movie, and D'Onofrio leaves a bit more angry than he does in the movie.  In the control room, Howard is getting worried because not only did D'Onofrio ditch her assistant, but her boss is landing his helicopter un-announced. The control-freak Howard hates surprises.  Back to D'Onofrio, he's outside the Velciraptor paddock talking to someone on his cellphone. Talking about how ""he'll find them. It's taken years to figure out where they went, but he can find them this time"".  At the other end of the line we have Wong who mentions ""if they knew what we were cooking up twenty years ago, they would never have signed off on that new one"".  Cut to Howard and Khan in the iRex paddock. Blah, blah, blah...more teeth. Get Pratt to inspect the paddock.  D'Onofrio is driving again. The suitcase is open on the passenger seat. We cannot see inside. He drives past a familiar sign that says ""east dock"". Inside the jeep the case begins to beep.  Pratt convinces Howard to check out the iRex paddock.  Back on the East Dock trail the case is beeping rapidly. D'Onofrio looks excited. He gets distracted by a call on his cell phone and between juggling the cell and then getting even more distracted by the case going from a rapid beep to a constant tone, he makes the classic Nedry mistake and runs his jeep off of the trail. As the jeep comes to a stop, with smoke coming out of the engine, all you hear is the tone coming from the case.  At the iRex paddock, a sneaky dino and a fat man's incompetence sets the iRex free.  Back at the East Dock trail, D'Onofrio gets out of the crashed jeep. The case is still giving off that tone. He looks pissed off and injured, and we see that his smartphone has been smashed, but the tone gives him purpose. He takes out the case and pulls some sort of microphone-looking device out of it. He starts waving it around pointed at the ground. After a few seconds the tone chirps. D'Onofrio starts to dig through the mud.  Jurassic World security are tracking down the iRex. They show up woefully unprepared and get eaten.  D'Onofrio is digging through the mud. He finds the Barbasol can Nedry hid the embryos in back in Jurassic Park 1. This is obviously what he's been looking for. He scrambles back up to the main road and starts walking.  From here D'Onofrio makes it to the old Jurassic Park building. Being much more competent than Nedry ever was he starts up one of the old jeeps and survives long enough to call in InGen's forces, push Pratt to hunt down the iRex with the rapter-squad, confronts Wong in his lab who confirms that the embryos Nedry stole 20 years ago weren't normal dinosaurs. Also, while the embryos are long dead, the sealed canister kept the DNA intact, which is all he needs to reactivate his old research. Combined with what he learned making the iRex, the ""Velociraptors will be obsolete in the next five years.""  Rest of the movie is basically unchanged except for the total lack of the useless brothers taking up time that could have been spent working on an actual relationship between Howard and Pratt. D'Onofrio dies, but not before Wong gets away with everything he needs to justify a sequel."

The target audience and the penultimate message to them was rooted in a kind of cynicism that's eating away at society and the film industry.

Yes, the real problem is that the I Rex has escaped, but once Howard and Pratt go searching for the boys, they're not really working on fixing the I Rex problem; they're just trying to save the boys.

I guess you can, technically, call me a screenwriter as I have been paid to write scripts, but I am considerably lower on the totem pole than Sean. The ""when I'm writing a big budget movie"" line wasn't meant to imply I had anything of such scope produced. I only meant that I have written such screenplays. Apologies if it came off that way.  I also don't claim I'm some sort of an expert when it comes to screenwriting. I realize this creates a situation that's a bit of an oxymoron (""You say you don't claim to be an expert but write blog posts about screenwriting"") but I believe that when it comes to storytelling, you can learn something from almost anyone. When I was at USC, the best screenwriting teacher I had was a guy who never had anything produced. On the other hand, we'd have Oscar-winning screenwriters visit the cinema school and babble incoherently when it came to talking about the craft of screenwriting. Paul Thomas Anderson, for example, is my favorite filmmaker but he just didn't know how to talk about screenwriting. So what I'm doing with these posts is basically sharing my experience in a, hopefully, entertaining and informative way. I write on Sean's blog because he asked me to and, I'd like to believe, because he likes my writing.  So, anyway, just wanted to clear that up because I sort of do feel self-conscious about writing on his blog.

Screenwriting,3cg8ps,2drums1cymbal,3,Wed Jul 8 00:30:04 2015 UTC,"I thought the spiel in the beginning of the film about consumers being bored and wanting bigger, scarier dinosaurs was a metaphor for the film industry, in many ways. Consumers are so used to being entertained (or so used to seeing plain old dinosaurs), that we now overload them with explosions and sex appeal to sell tickets (or create a spliced up uber-dino every few seasons). I suppose unintentionally, the horribly developed main characters were also metaphors for the film industry--quality work is sometimes shifted to the back burner to make way for more special effects and cheap thrills.  I enjoyed the film for what it was, but I think everyone else in the movie was way more interesting than the main characters, which is unfortunate."
Screenwriting,3cg8ps,befree1231,3,Tue Jul 7 22:22:02 2015 UTC,"I saw that metaphor too and think that, if anything, it was underplayed. Instead of just having that one-off line and then relying on every character basically making the stupidest decisions ever, why not have some antagonists that stand-in for slimy producers, shallow talent agents and other awful Hollywood tropes move it forward?  It's really the only problem I have with the movie is that it was so consumed with making nods to the original and being self-aware that it didn't actually flesh out any of its more interesting ideas.  But, then again, that would've taken away from all the dinosaur-smashy-smash, so I guess we broke even."

Huh? I...don't even know where to begin with this. How was that in any way her story arc? I honestly think we saw very different movies. To my mind, to say that her story arc was learning that ""career = bad"" and ""kids and family and having a boyfriend = good"" is a total oversimplification. And I think the writer would agree. But suppose it were: how is that sexist? Being too into your work that it cuts into the way you treat your family, your loved ones...isn't somehow particular to women. In fact, I'd argue it's more often applied to men, seeing as they're the ones who stereotypically overwork themselves to the point where they lose touch with their loved ones. Learning that career isn't everything is a valuable lesson and frankly not sexist in any way.   Plus even when she takes charge - i.e.. saving Pratt's life, the boys still say they feel safer with him. ""Your boyfriend's a badass."" Ugh. Yeah sure not all women in action movies are going to be Furiosa - that'd get kind of tired too.

Ok, if these criticism are ""soooooooooooooo shallow,"" I can't exactly see you providing any counter-interpretation of what you think her actual emotional journey was. Dude. It's my opinion. On the internet. You asked for someone (presumably) to explain why they thought the movie was sexist. I did so. As have many other writers. It's not right or wrong. It's an opinion. Look I don't think it was a terrible film. I can enjoy it to an extent as a big dumb movie. I just think we can do so much better in terms of writing interesting female characters - ones that aren't just rehashes of dull-as-dishwater, decades-old gender tropes. They don't necessarily have to be complex. Just not throwback cliches.   And of course being ""too into your work"" is applied to male characters in film too. Never said it wasn't. But there was something very ickily specific about how she was put in her place throughout the course of the movie, about putting her career first. Her sister saying ""you WILL have kids"" - essentially setting up her emotional arc towards more a traditionally ""maternal"" outlook. But anyway. This is just my opinion. I'd say you already have yours locked down."

Ok, if these criticism are ""soooooooooooooo shallow,"" I can't exactly see you providing any counter-interpretation of what you think her actual emotional journey was.   Ok. Saying ""what"" her emotional journey was is quite a different thing from providing a rational argument for why it's sexist.  As for my interpretation, I think there's a big difference between ""career = bad/ Kids and BF = good"" and ""maybe stop being so intense about your career. There are other things in life, you know.""   As have many other writers.   All of them sharing the exact same peculiar worldview wherein almost every representation of anything ever is sexist. It's totally bizarre.   Yes, that was a slight exaggeration. But there are patterns to this type of thought. Like when you said,    the boys still say they feel safer with him. ""Your boyfriend's a badass."" Ugh. Yeah sure not all women in action movies are going to be Furiosa - that'd get kind of tired too.   Like who actually gets upset about that sort of stuff? She's just...one woman. And he's just one dude. In a movie. Like I don't get upset as a Jew when there's one Jewish dude in a movie who's nerdy/self-deprecating...because there really are Jews just like that, and this particular movie happens to have one in it....  It feels like you're taking individuals and treating them as collectives, like in your mind, somehow Chris Pratt's representing all guys, and Howard's representing all girls. But that's not the case.    I'd say you already have yours locked down.    Uh. I guess? It's just your opinion is one I see quite frequently, especially on certain segments of the internet, and it simply boggles my mind. I don't get it. I've tried to get it.

You bring a new director, he hates the old version and wants to write a new one. (Which actually happened in this case.) That means he needs to write this thing in 2 months and get the camera rolling in 3. When he gives you the script, you can see the glaring problems but you've been through this cycle before.

Secondly, try to turn things around in your head. Rather than view your country's under-developed film industry as a problem, view it as an opportunity! Nobody's making films in you country - that means that any film you make there will stand out, just by virtue of being made there.   Hollywood is really good at poaching talent from other countries. If you became the breakout filmmaker from NoWhereIstan, Hollywood is going to come knocking on your door.   Meanwhile, NoWhereIstan is almost certainly friendlier to new talent than Hollywood is - because Hollywood is actively hostile to new talent. Places with no film industry are, at worst, indifferent, and at best shockingly supporting because they WANT a film industry.   You may have to do more.

The integrity of the blacklist score is important, a ten implies to me, that the script I am about to read is a shooter and could go straight into production.  Of those 10000 how many of those is likely to be that good? Given that the majority of people who submit to the blacklist are not working pros, although many do including the writer of saving mr banks.  I read her screenplay and it was different to the finished product, I do not know it's blacklist score  but I would doubt even that got a ten.  She's no mug btw, she's friends with Tom Hardy and wrote dialogue daily for George Miller on set for Mad Max fury road and I bet even she would struggle to get a ten.

Screenwriting,3cgkd6,jivester,2,Sat Jul 11 11:33:26 2015 UTC,"That's actually been my point all along. 10's SHOULDN'T be unicorns - they're being graded too harshly.   Think of it like this. Every year there's a bunch of scripts, often from unknown writers, that see them winning big cash prizes in major script comps, or getting signed by major agencies, or selling to major studios/prodCo's, or attracting A-list actors, or attracting financing, or topping the annual Blacklist. These should be 10's. Remember, a 10 on the BL is based on ""likelihood of recommendation to an industry peer or superior.""   Yes, they're ""rare"", but they occur on a more regular basis than 0.01% - especially since the BL is a PAID service, for people who would take their screenwriting careers more seriously than someone just chucking it up on Scribd and submitting to r/readmyscript.  People are buying, selling, producing and representing scripts - worth hundreds of thousands of dollars - each year at a much higher frequency. To those people, those scripts are 10's. Or they wouldn't stake their professional reputations on them.   Plus, Franklin said himself that they grade harshly, and having a lot of 10's diminishes their power and reputation, which is absolutely fair - but was my point all along."

Screenwriting,3cgkd6,jivester,-4,Sat Jul 11 12:18:02 2015 UTC,"So statistically it's a negligible number and realistically the number scoring should be between 1-9. Maybe been 2-8.   10's are way too rare and too scary for readers to give, as they seem to indicate something close to perfection."
Screenwriting,3cgkd6,franklinleonard,5,Wed Jul 8 06:16:39 2015 UTC,"Well, statistically speaking, if you look at a normal distribution, you'd expect about 0.27% of scores to be more than three standard deviations beyond the mean (roughly a 1 or a 10), which means that we're pretty much what you'd expect."

Screenwriting,3cgkd6,jivester,0,Wed Jul 8 17:48:09 2015 UTC,"I guess it's a question of ""what does a 10 mean?""  When readers give a script a ten, are they saying it's perfect and can be shot tomorrow without a word changed? Then yeah, 0.01% of submissions may be right.  If they're saying ""This stands up to the work of industry professionals,"" or ""This is good enough to be bought by a major studio/production company"" or ""This is simply an extremely good piece of work"" or ""I would highly recommend this to a superior"" then obviously 0.01% seems incredibly low.   What is the ratio of 9's to 10's?"
Screenwriting,3cgkd6,franklinleonard,5,Wed Jul 8 08:26:04 2015 UTC,"As we've said many times, the rating is meant to reflect how likely a reader would be to recommend the script to a peer or superior in the industry.   A 10 is roughly three standard deviations above the mean, so you'd expect, purely based on a normal distribution, about 0.13%. So yes, it's low, but not THAT low.   And that's admittedly partially by design. We want to be ""tough graders."" If we were indiscriminate in awarding high scores, industry professionals would be less likely to pay attention when scripts receive them.  Over the last year. 0.31% of evaluations have yielded an overall score of 9. And before you ask, 2.47% have yielded an overall score of 8."

A 9 gets you on the same lists as a 10 and doesn't come with the super expectations of being in 0.01% -- ""this better be the best script I've ever read!""   TL;DR - Fuck 10's. If you get a 9, you should take it as a 10."
Screenwriting,3cgkd6,magelanz,2,Wed Jul 8 10:18:34 2015 UTC,"First off, we've never commented on the likelihood of scripts that receive 9s getting reps, options/sales, etc.  vis a vis 10s, and it wouldn't at all valuable information since getting reps, options, and sales relies on a number of factors outside the overall rating of a single reader of a script.  I suppose, theoretically, we could just have a scale of 1 to 9, but base 10 is sort of a foundational aspect of mathematics that we have admittedly defaulted to.  I guess what I'm saying is, take a 9 however you would like. Take a 4 as a 10 if that's what makes you happy, but a 9 isn't a 10 and neither is a 4. A 10 is a 10."

Log Line: An NFL coach’s last chance to turn a horrible team around is in the mind of a prodigy who knows nothing about football.  Synopsis: The New Jersey Wolverines have been the laughing stock of the NFL for the last decade. They go 6-10, at best, every year. The owner is tired of the nonsense he’s put up with. He threatens to replace the head coach, Danny, if he can’t get the team to a winning season. Danny sees the talent that he has around him, and he’s baffled why it doesn’t work out. Until he meets his saving grace: David. David has never bothered himself with football. He has never found the sport to be mentally stimulating, not until he attends his first game. Only when he does, does he find that there is a cognitive aspect to football. His pre-equipped genius helps change the direction that the New Jersey Wolverines were heading into... he leads them to greatness. The clincher? He’s only 14.

Synopsis: Douglas, unhappy with his mundane existence as a factory worker, dreams of a glitz filled life as a successful Broadway playwright. One night he hosts a dinner party to pitch his first play to producers, writers and actors who can help make his project legitimate. However, Walter, his bully of a co­-worker, shows up early and threatens to bring it all to a screeching halt. In a fit of rage, Douglas snaps and kills him. Desperate to fulfill his dreams of making it on Broadway, he hides the body and attempts to carry on as if nothing had happened. When the guests begin to arrive, and someone discovers Walter’s body, the night spirals wildly out of control. As Douglas fights to keep his dream alive, bodies begin to pile up. Douglas is now faced with a serious dilemma; he can go back to his miserable life, or find a way to keep ahead of the body count so he can shine under the bright lights of Broadway."

I'm trying to keep this group limited to those serious and dedicated to writing humor to foster good discussion.  And i think the best way to do that is to gather a group of professionals and work out carefully from there.  ...truthfully, i guess if you are serious about the craft come try your luck with us.  The sign out front is more or less just to scare off the people wearing clown shoes. I havent kicked anybody out yet who's come in despite their work history.

Once, recently, I had a character the other had been talking about who came into the scene. They didn't know what she looked like, so they continued talking about her and she joined in. It doesn't really do the reader any favors to be ahead of the audience at that point. It was much more helpful to just call her 'Waitress' until the reveal. And I did wonder whether I should put her name in all caps when it WAS revealed."

If it's the biggest thing you noticed, I will definitely have to return to that and try to narrow down the directions.  I was hoping to direct the short as well. I put the directions there mostly as notes to myself when I start directing. With that in mind, is it still a bad practice? Am I in fact better off writing those notes separately, minimizing the script notes, and allowing the actors to interpret everything themselves based on my direction?   I will take your note seriously and do some editing. Thanks so much."

Of course, even this gets interesting when a project's title changes!! Oy. Within that, when working my way through various drafts and revisions, I generally just title them with dates. So PROJECT X - MAY 2015 or whatever. And the pull-down list of files within will be in date order anyway. Mostly my files are my full script, especially once working in the software, but my Word files -- i.e. when brainstorming or working on individual scenes -- are titled by what they are: CAMPING SCENE, for example.   Definitely more messy than ultra-organized, but it works."

I want to cut, I'll save it as a new file i.e. PROJECT X - JUNE 2015, cut the stuff, keep working. If I change my mind, I can pull up the May version and voila, there are the old, resurrect-able scenes. If I do a few versions in same month, it's just PROJECT X - JUNE 2015 - II or whatever. This is all for work in process stuff. Once I have that latest final, I'll then create a pdf file and simply note title and my name --- PROJECT X - J. Bxxxxxxx --- no dates, no draft revision # or anything. Again, the system notes the ""date"" behind the scenes and that's good enough for me. So ......... in MM Screenwriter, I may have 15+ working drafts across however many months, but only 2,3 or 4 pdf files for that project."
Screenwriting,3cegtl,JoniB22,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:12:32 2015 UTC,So for your very first draft do you still name it with the date? And on each draft/revision (don't know the difference) do you still put the draft number on the title page or just the date?
Screenwriting,3cegtl,NoMoreMrNiceGaius_6,2,Wed Jul 8 02:38:06 2015 UTC,"I've done it a few ways .... sometimes I note FIRST DRAFT, or SCRIBBLE DRAFT, or even WACK DRAFT, and sometimes it's just the date, JANUARY. That first document may not make it all the way through, start to finish. Maybe it's 50 pages, 60, 80.   Once I start working in the software, I'm not so much a ""puke out the vomit draft"" sort of writer as I am a ""tinkerer""....... I do all my pre-writing longhand. Old school. Weapons of choice: composition books to brainstorm the story, create my characters, and work my way through some semblance of a structured plot. I'll do some scene writing in those too. Usually 1-2 comp books filled per project. At some point, I'll switch over to legal pads for scene writing. Maybe it's just cuz I'm old, I don't know, but I tend to think much better and write more freely with a pen in my hand than with a keyboard under my fingers. Plus, I feel like much less of a dork carrying around comp books and legal pads than I do a laptop. Even where I live, which isn't L.A. Oh, and that whole ""blank page"" thing is much less daunting on paper than on a screen. But that's me...  Once I'm into formatting software, I'm doing less ""writing"" and more ""typing"" from my notes. For me, working in the software nudges me to worry more about ""how things look"" than ""what it says"", which is why I hand-write first --- my vomit draft is via paper and pen, I guess. Once typing, if I change something fairly significant -- dropping or adding characters, abandoning a plot point, altering the opening, choosing a better midpoint, etc. -- but want to hold onto that ""stuff"", I rename ... FEBRUARY, then MARCH, then March rev B, or whatever. The funny thing is until I get all the way through to the end, even if semi-sloppy, there won't be a PDF created........ for me, the PDF is an end-point. Not a ""period"", so much as a ""comma"", because it's not really an end-point, per se, but it's where I drive a stake in the ground and proclaim, OK, someone read this please. And I'm comfortable with this because I've ""tinkered"" so much along the way, I'm confident in it as a whole, even if not yet stellar all the way through .. if that makes sense. Like with one project, I knew I had this ""culmination scene"" in my third act that was an absolute cluster-fuck. But ... I wanted to try it out, see what others thought, so I stopped where I was, created the PDF and took it to my ""first circle"" of readers..... a combination of friendlies and industry folk who'll give me honest feedback. Every reader stumbled on that one scene big-time!!  Feedback in hand, I sometimes start all over...... Or I shelve it.   Yeah, I don't know what to call all those files either..... they're not full drafts, but work-in-process files at various points in time.   Mine's a strange process but thus far, it's what's worked for me. I'd sure like to be quicker about things, but haven't quite figured that out yet. Gonna be a real test once I ""get an assignment""!!"

Screenwriting,3cf01d,Proxify,3,Tue Jul 7 11:56:34 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, all you have to do is communicate what the character is feeling in the most effective way. So for example, in this situation I would write a short sentence describing what is going through the characters head in the action, as long as it is tied to facial expression, it normally works well.  So for your decision I would write something like:     X pauses for a moment, a look of distress on his face. Do I really have to do this?                                                  X                                           Fine, I'll do it.   For the group one, your best bet might to just find an action that would be commonly associated with distress:     The group murmur amongst themselves, some shifting in place, some staring at the ground,     one man runs his hands through his hair.   Obviously just suggestions, but I hope they help, Good luck!"

Screenwriting,3cf01d,5858butseriously,2,Tue Jul 7 13:19:35 2015 UTC,"What you're describing, the internal dialogue the character is saying to themselves, is what is called Third Person Limited Perspective. It's a very common, and useful, trick used in prose. Mastering it will make prose so much smoother, and allow you to convey much more information in a subtle way without feeling clunky. Maybe it's just personal taste, but I'd avoid using ""I"" in the action line. Sidestep the pronoun by simply writing, ""Is this the best option?"""
Screenwriting,3cf01d,DickHero,2,Tue Jul 7 15:51:22 2015 UTC,"going through the characters head in the action   This is really important for actors. They might call it ""face acting.""

Screenwriting,3cf01d,HotspurJr,2,Tue Jul 7 15:56:14 2015 UTC,The solution to this problem is in observation.   You need to watch people until recognize what actions distinguish somebody doing something begrudgingly from somebody doing something excited.   Don't be scared off by the can't-write-internal-states nazis. Nobody will ever have a problem with selkiesthehero's first example.

The focus of the world is controlled by you, the writer. You bring attention to things you feel are important and push the story forward.   To anchor something early in your script you make it explicit. Example: Have your character rub the top of his head and then someone that knows him says, ""You really don't want to do this do you. Your rubbing your head again."" That is a really, ""on the nose"" way of bringing attention to it. Then later when he doesn't want to do something he rubs the top of his head again. It's up to the audience to put them together. And audiences like doing this kind of work. Figuring things out. Not to mention if this feeling helps foreshadow some future tension that is sure to create a problem for the protagonist."

Screenwriting,3cf01d,wrytagain,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:43:26 2015 UTC,What I was getting at was that the context of the scene would probably make it clear the character is speaking begrudgingly.  Not sure if you were just making a playful joke or trying to demean my comment.
Screenwriting,3cf01d,DickHero,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:55:27 2015 UTC,"Actually, I was agreeing with you. Should have added a TL;DR - Avoid using unnecessary words unless they are absolutely necessary."
Screenwriting,3cf01d,Belerion,-2,Wed Jul 8 20:02:47 2015 UTC,"The reason you're having problems is because you cannot show emotions in film, you can only show actions. It is impossible to display visually what is in the character's head in a dramatic way - their actions are what you are interested in, and the audience interprets their emotions from that point. Obviously you must know what thoughts motivate a character's actions, but the point of a visual medium is not to communicate the non-visual. You can cheat and write something on the page such as ""he begrudgingly cuts off his own earlobe,"" but really you're just passing the problem off to someone down the line. Eventually the director or actor will have to interpret that emotion and communicate it as an action. But you should be the one to figure that out in order to better serve your own story. Let's take ""begrudgingly"" as an example of how to figure this out. That word is great because it already implies conflict - the character does not want to do something, but is being forced to for some reason or another. So what actions communicate reluctance to perform an action? Hesitation for one. Irregular breathing. Beginning the action, then stopping, then continuing. Stress can be indicated by sweating, nervousness by fidgeting, sitting or standing in a closed position that makes the body look smaller. These are just suggestions, and you should be able to think of the body language that communicates those emotions. I know this sounds odd, but trust me, I've been doing it wrong for a long time and have only recently realized the principles behind this, but it makes a huge difference. Don't focus on emotion, focus on action. That is not to say take the emotion out of it - it is simply the way that emotion must be communicated in a visual form. And screenwriting is ultimately a visual medium."
Screenwriting,3cf01d,DickHero,2,Tue Jul 7 13:32:20 2015 UTC,"Hesitation for one. Irregular breathing. Beginning the action, then stopping, then continuing.    Doesn't sound odd at all, I was way worse at this but from time to time some emotions still sneak past me, thanks!"
Screenwriting,3cf01d,Belerion,2,Tue Jul 7 13:38:55 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. You've given two ideas for conveying ""begrudgingly"": hesitation and irregular breathing. If I was an actor and read that my character hesitated and had irregular breathing I would assume that I was meant to be fearful, or excited, or nervous, or was having a heart attack. I wouldn't assume to be begrudging."
Screenwriting,3cf01d,DickHero,-1,Tue Jul 7 14:17:11 2015 UTC,"Okay, so you don't like my examples. Fair enough, come up with different ones. It doesn't change or argue against my point."
Screenwriting,3cf01d,Belerion,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:26:44 2015 UTC,"Your point is wrong.  This what you said:   you cannot show emotions in film   You can't?  You can't show anger, sadness, joy, fear, disgust?  You can't show those thing on film?  But you can, just as you can show them in real life.  How they are shown might be something the writer wants to include by describing something specific for  story purpose.  Say, a poker tell.    But in general, it's up to actors and directors to convey emotions the screenwriters include. Your point is ... some hobby horse you ride around here, and it's simply wrong.  Do what you want in your own scripts, but stop telling newbs not to write emotions.  They might believe you.   Many great screenwriters write emotions into their scripts."

For example, if the text says Joe runs to the bathroom, then we can see the outer doing, the action, but also he gets there and there is a long line, so he has TO CONVINCE the guy in front of him to let him go first.   But also writers can an INNER ACTION, something like: when Joe gets to the bathroom and notices a long line, he does a little potty dance, but I really gotta pee!   Bawdy I admit. I should have used a love scene."
Screenwriting,3cf01d,DickHero,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:00:46 2015 UTC,"You sort of proved my point there, though. When Joe gets to the bathroom with the line, what does he do? A potty dance. That is very much a physical, visual action that communicates an inner state, which is exactly what I was talking about. Emotions are communicated (in film) through action. Words can also be actions, they're just usually not as dramatic."
Screenwriting,3cezpy,DiamondSeal,3,Tue Jul 7 11:53:11 2015 UTC,"If something's going to ""trip you up"", I doubt it'll be music references. I suppose to some readers, ultra-specific nods at bands or songs might cause an eye-roll or two, but it's not going to be a difference maker ... IMO. If noting the sort of music lends to your story's tone, great. Personally, if I reference music, it has to make sense for the scene and the story, especially if it's some specific song. Otherwise, if it's a tonal thing, I'll just call out the sort of music, but not specific band/song names. Easy enough to get away with ""frenetic electronica"", ""twangy country"", ""screaming punk"", ""cheesy '80s ballad"", etc. Have a kick-ass story in an amazing script, and let the chips fall where they may......."
Screenwriting,3cezpy,JoniB22,2,Tue Jul 7 12:22:47 2015 UTC,"Depends a lot on the context.   The short answer is that music references are fine, but ""continuously"" doing so could easily tip into one of a couple of problems.   Are you asking the music to do the emotional heavy lifting for you? This is a common problem for young writers - they don't write a scene that has emotions in it, but they slap ""My Heart Will Always Go On"" over it and think they've done the hard work.   Is that music an organic part of the story? Or are you just naming your favorite bands and songs because young people use music as a tribal identifier and you see that as a way of working yourself into the script?   etc etc etc  If specific songs are a problem, the producer will use something else, so music rights are actually rarely going to be an issue in a spec screenplay.    The real issue is how you're using them as a storytelling tool, and the fact that you wrote ""continuously"" gives me pause."
Screenwriting,3cezpy,HotspurJr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:03:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I should have been more clear. ""Continuously"" may have been the wrong word to use. One character will mention the band two or three times to his friends. Their room will have some posters relating to that genre.  It is not entirely essential, although it does have a place. I had wanted this screenplay to exhibit various parts of a certain culture, which is a huge part of the entire story.  At no point do I intend to give directions on what sort of music should be played."
Screenwriting,3cezpy,lookexpensive,3,Tue Jul 7 17:49:41 2015 UTC,"Check out High Fidelity. There's a TON of musical name-dropping in that script, but it feels organic to the characters, and the most important band in the movie isn't even a real band in our world."
Screenwriting,3cezpy,HotspurJr,2,Tue Jul 7 19:39:13 2015 UTC,"That sounds fine.   Although be careful that you're not asking it to carry too much weight  from a characterization standpoint. That kind of detail can be a great little piece of information about a character, but it's only one puzzle piece.   People have very different associations with different bands, so it may carry less weight than you think it does, but so long as you're aware of that, what you describe sounds fine."
Screenwriting,3cezpy,NameIWontRegret,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:22:46 2015 UTC,"I write but I also produce as my day job. If you can clear (obtain copyright) on the material it is not an issue if you get it into production. But, say you keep referencing the Rolling Stones. You're film is likely to be low budget, and you simply won't have the cash to afford the music rights. So, as long as the band is reasonable you have a shot. Otherwise, I would write it differently."

Screenwriting,3cezpy,Ootrab,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:38:50 2015 UTC,"It's okay as long as someone reading it who doesn't know the song will still know what you are referencing. It's usually better to describe a certain genre or type of music as opposed to an actual song.   But there's nothing wrong with describing a character like ""ANNIE, (17), a disaffected youth wearing a Ramones T-shirt"" If the film ever goes into production the shirt will probably change, but it gives us a good idea of the type of person she is as a character.   The key is to strive for clarity. If you're referencing a certain band, you might want to describe the type of music as well."

This year, I won the ScreenCraft Fellowship and the Zoetrope and it got me signed at 3 Arts. screencraft.org  WeScreenplay's winner last year, Tom Vecchio, sold his script and now has 2 different scripts in pre-production since his win. (Full disclosure, I am a member of the WISC team) wescreenplay.com/contest  David Asaff won Table Read my Screenplay and he got signed by management. He then optioned a script. tablereadmyscreenplay.com  I believe all 5 Nicholl Finalists landed representation last year (this is the only one I'm not positive). oscars.org/nicholl  The winners of PAGE AWARDS generally have 1 or 2 among them land reps. pageawards.com/  TrackingB launch pad had 4 different people land reps this year. trackingb.com/  CineStory's winner 2 years ago was Patrick Tobin who wrote CAKE. That win started his career. cinestory.org  Austin Film Fest's winner last year was signed by reps. austinfilmfestival.com  Honestly, the list goes on and on. There are at least 50 people every year who get some sort of start in the industry thanks to a screenwriting contest.  There is only 1 big thing you really need to ask before entering:  Will the contest introduce me to someone with influence in the industry? Passing your script along is great, but you want to make sure you actually talk on the phone or meet someone as well. For example, the WeScreenplay Grand Prize Winner will have a mentorship with acclaimed producer Douglas Saylor Jr. Having a sit down and conversation with a big player is what can make the difference.  Hope this helps."

Screenwriting,3cehs7,sblawrie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:13:59 2015 UTC,"Guess my question back would be ""for what purpose?"" IMO, there are only a few -- like two or three -- which might do you any good in terms of ""exposure"" and ""heat"" for your script ... and that's pretty much only if you win or are in the top few runners-up. Nicholl. Austin. Maybe one other. Tough odds with those, but then again......... all odds are tough in this pursuit.  If you're looking for feedback, there are a few decent competitions providing such. Blue Cat comes to mind.   Some competitions are to win a spot in labs..... if that's something you covet, submit to those.   Some have prizes you might be after. Like ... I won Movie Magic Screenwriter software in one, and that was like super cool and useful.   The rest are a dime a dozen. Well, they can be mighty pricey and probably don't mean much but if you utilize them to, for example, meet a deadline, then they can serve that purpose.   I've read a lot of articles and listened to a lot of interviews with agents/managers and it seems to me -- unless you're a winner on Nicholl -- the contest thing doesn't mean anything/much to them. I'd never suggest noting your placing in any of them, especially some obscure one.   Honestly, my gut check would be ""save your money!"""
Screenwriting,3cehs7,JoniB22,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:32:59 2015 UTC,"The Nicholl, the Nicholl, the Nicholl, the Nicholl, and the Nicholl.  There is no question that it is the best contest for an amateur. Not only do the ten finalists get read everywhere in town, but you can quarterfinal in the contest and find yourself getting calls from managers.   Furthermore, less so than any other contest are you are the mercy of the subjective whims of the reader since everyone gets read at least twice, and if one of those reads is strong enough you get read a third time.   Oh yeah, the money you win is substantial. The Nicholl is a money-losing contest, which I don't think anyone else can say. (Maybe the FD contest loses money because they see it as marketing for the software, I don't know - but they're losing money with an agenda, if so. Maybe festival badges subsidize Austin's prizes, I'm not sure. Less nefarious, but still expecting something for their money. The Nicholl is endowed).   The Austin contest is valuable primarily because of its connection to the festival, which can be a great experience and you can get a badge just by placing. Some other contests - TrackingB (which seems structured to be favorable for highly-commercial screenplays) and FD have had winners get some attention, but I don't think placing in them does you any good.   But even making the second round of the Nicholl gets you some attention. Semifinalist status should be able to get you read almost anywhere if you hustle well. Plus, you know, enough money to live on for a year."
Screenwriting,3cehs7,HotspurJr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:00:21 2015 UTC,"Okay, for sure thanks for the tips.  I'm pretty sure Short Term 12 first got attention through the Nicholl, but I could be wrong.  You're definitely not the first person to mention it to me.  But once you've (somehow) won a thing like this, is there any chance of also getting to direct it, too?"
Screenwriting,3cehs7,HotspurJr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:00:05 2015 UTC,"But once you've (somehow) won a thing like this, is there any chance of also getting to direct it, too?   It's all about leverage. In theory, yes, you can always leverage yourself into the director's chair if you're willing to walk away from a paycheck and/or a chance to actually see the film made.   In practice, however, it's much more complicated than that.   First of all, you may not have another chance to get the film made or get paid for it. So when somebody wants to make your movie with someone else directing, you have to consider the very real possibility that it will be years - if ever - before you get a chance to make it again. (Add in the whole having-grown-up-bills-to-pay issue, and it gets even more complicated).   The nature of the script matters a lot. It's a lot easier to negotiate yourself into the directing chair on a small, personal film than it is something big and expensive.   Secondly, you have to ask yourself honestly if you're capable of directing the movie. Go to any film school, and you'll see plenty of evidence that even working very hard, studying, and having a talented cast is no guarantee that you'll be able to make the movie come together. Directing films is hard.   Third, even if you can direct the movie competently, it's worth asking if you're the best possible available director for the film. That is to say, imagine that you-the-writer and you-the-director were different people, and you-the-writer got to pick the director for the project. Is there any reason at all that you would pick you-the-director, aside from the ""you"" part? Does you-the-writer really want your film directed by somebody with your level of experience?   There is a wide-spread perspective that directing is about power, and it's true that successful directors have a lot more power than successful writers. But the thing is, directing is a craft - a very difficult one - and the power directors have generally comes from their mastery of that craft. If you view directing as being primarily about power or glory, you're probably not putting yourself in a position to succeed as a director."

Screenwriting,3cccdp,Appletoper,3,Mon Jul 6 20:23:01 2015 UTC,"Read the original script for 'Edge of Tomorrow' by DW Harper which, before it was rewritten by about four different writers (including Christopher McQuarrie), was called 'All You Need is Kill'. Hands down one of the most ballsy, intelligent and entertaining scripts I've ever come across. It's awesome and packs a wallop of an emotional punch at the end.   It's also really interesting to compare it with the final end product (Edge of Tomorrow), which is still alot of fun. Plus it sold on spec for a reported 7 figure sum.  https://indiegroundfilms.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/all-you-need-is-kill-apr1-10-1st.pdf"
Screenwriting,3cccdp,neonoirontoast,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:15:44 2015 UTC,"Just finished it, much better than the film. Although half of that might be how much I hate the shakicam. Dammit Doug Liman...  Really disliked what they did with the troops in the film too, it felt a bit like Harry Potter, lots of secondary characters given absolutely no development. The training scenes could have been like Starship Troopers otherwise.  Wish they'd played a bit more with the receiver idea, particularly the twist at the end. Done something new with it, perhaps a POV switch to Rita to explore the idea that they are just two receivers in a chain. The Mimic purposefully create new receivers. The humans go insane with the resets and come back from that insanity to realise how to escape the loop.  The battle won, they are praised as champions and spearhead the next attack. Only to realise that the enemy has now infiltrated the ranks, is now using them as a receiver to organise the troops and anticipate movements. And in that next battle a new Looper is created, destined to reset until they kill their predecessor and take on their mantle.  But, in the same way that the humans become superb soldiers, the Mimic get to learn all about the humans, their tactics etc. And, if the receivers are killed, it becomes a race to kill either the Broadcaster or the Looper. Once the receivers are gone there's no more resetting.  Rita has to make her choice, and Cage has to make a moral decision whether he will do the same."

Screenwriting,3cd7wb,Psyladine,2,Tue Jul 7 15:21:25 2015 UTC,Her inciting incident was when the obnoxious customer insisted on paying with cash and her boss gave her the cash to bank.  Movies often have a main character (Norman) and a protag (Marion). Marion dies at the mid-point. But she's the one with the arc. Norman has no arc. No stakes. No goal.   Somebody was talking about genre switching the other day.  It's an interesting film in that it starts as one thing and suddenly we are watching something else.
Screenwriting,3cd7wb,wrytagain,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:06:35 2015 UTC,I don't really see her death as the inciting incident. It doesn't happen until ACT II.
Screenwriting,3cd7wb,bonoohno,2,Tue Jul 7 16:11:28 2015 UTC,"It's like, if you take her away, nothing happens. So she must bet he main character, right? Except it is Norman who if taken away, nothing happens. He is the protagonist, we even follow his POV! And for the rest of teh film, we follow the protagonist being antagonized by Argle and then Marion's sister and sister's fiance.   It's a wonderful inversion of the straight forward story model. Raymond Chandler called it 'the turn', where all the original threads had been explored and then a new element was introduced that was unrelated but seen to be in hindsight as inevitable.  Everything after Marion is fallout, but it seems as though a new story is beginning, it's really the conclusion of (Marion's and Norman's) separate but bound in death storylines."
Screenwriting,3cd7wb,Psyladine,3,Tue Jul 7 16:33:03 2015 UTC,"Hard to discuss this without spoiling movies, but three that spring to mind are No Country for Old Men, LA Confidential and Minority Report.  In No Country, a character is killed off in the final third which completely changes the rest of the movie. When I first watched it I was a little let down by death, but on subsequent viewings I realised that the main protaganist is actually another character.  In LA Confidential and Minority Report there are a bunch of supporting characters and it's one of these that are killed when they start to unravel the mystery of the movie (both are similar genres, crime thrillers).  I'd say that killing off your protaganist with a bunch of time left in the movie could be a bad thing. Because you've got to think about who the movie will follow for the rest of the movie as it'll no longer have a protaganist. If you think of the movie as the protaganists story, there's not much more to their story once they die. That's why in many movies where the protaganist dies, it's at the end, because death often means the story can't go on.  One thing I'd question is why your second act starts after 30-40 minutes. You should be way into it by that point. Possibly you don't understand acts...or I don't understand them. However, act 2 begins when your main character is propelled into their journey / story. Act 2 is basically everything between the beginning and the end. So if your character dies at the start of act 2 what will happen for the rest of the movie?"
Screenwriting,3cd7wb,dasblog,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:40:36 2015 UTC,"Well, there are two protagonists. Some of one is killed off I can still follow the other. But the examples are very helpful, much thanks for them."
Screenwriting,3cd7wb,dasblog,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:54:15 2015 UTC,"You should definitely check out the movies I mentioned then as they all have multiple characters, one of which is killed off. One suggestion I'd make is that you focus on the character that survives a bit more to ensure they're clearly the main protagonist, so it's not so jarring when the other character dies.  LA Confidential is a great example and a really well written movie."

Could imagine how awesome it would have been if Kyle Reese got killed at the start of Act 2? Audiences would have their minds blown, John Connor running around out of his mind, questioning his whole existence? Probably would have to pull a switcharoo at the end and reveal someone else was the 'real' Kyle Reese, but that would have been ballsy move that would have added 100x more drama and stakes to the story.  But they didn't do it.

You need to really identify what exactly the script is about, the key characters, beats and plot. Start by writing out longer versions and then stage by stage compressing the hell out of them until you get it down to 30 words max.   It sucks, but that's also the way it works. The less words you can use to nail down what your story is about, the less chance a producer is going to get bored when you pitch it to them."
Screenwriting,3ce3p8,neonoirontoast,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:06:44 2015 UTC,"Like, thematically, it's about accepting the decisions we make as adults and how we learn to grow up with it. Seeing people suffering and having compassion is such an amazing trait and skill to have. I have everyone working through their problems along the way and feel really emotional towards the end point where one of my characters realizes she isn't good enough to lead anyone and that she's failed everyone. And the main character has this very brief moment in a old burned building to rekindle her hope in herself.  That's some pretty good advice though. Loglines are brutal business for me.

I added immature since you mentioned the theme is about her learning to grow up and take responsibility.  But I have no idea what happens in act two of this movie.

Most people  go to the movies to be distracted from the monotony and desperation that characterizes life, so I suspect that a serious movie about suicide would not be well received unless it's about someone famous.   Aside from that,  I find it difficult to imagine how a suicide can be the entire basis of a film. It s a pretty short lived action and couldn't easily be dragged or over a whole movie.   I think suicide is also a very sensitive thing to portray. When I saw The Rules of Attraction at the movies, one person had their own mini stampede for the fire escape when the suicide scene came on. We could hear them having a panic attack on their way to the door while multiple others were making choking noises. Take a look at it; it's fucking horrific. Very few people are going to sign up for that when choosing a movie to watch.   This doesn't mean you can't write about it,  just that it's likely to have a small audience."

Throughout the movie, they pick three people who seem suicidal on the outside but, in reality, aren't. When they get back to their room after the third failure, they find a blender from the guy across the hall. They go to his room and find out that he's downed a bottle of pills.

Screenwriting,3cb60u,DickHero,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:22:57 2015 UTC,"Write about anything you want, get a draft finished. Then, when revising, start to think of how your story can separate itself from the herd. What makes this story worth telling? Why is it compelling for you? And how can you make it compelling for the audience? Movies such as Wristcutters, The Big Chill, and Before I Disappear all begin to unpack how the event of suicide affects the characters involved."
Screenwriting,3cb60u,d_fallt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:27:53 2015 UTC,"What if it is a comedy and only a laughable attempt at suicide. ""The End"" (1978) for example.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077504/ I assume if it is comedy there is no taboo and it will not scare people away."

Screenwriting,3cb60u,9c9bs,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:05:44 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think it has to tie into the theme.   If your main character is depressed and the movie is about that, then it makes sense that they may try to take their own life.  However, I think suicide is often used in movies due to the drama attached to it and also because the screenwriter is struggling to write their way out of a situation.   For instance, if the main character has lost everything (his girlfriend, house, friends etc) the screenwriter can be at a loss as to how push their story forward. How do they get the character out of this situation? They can't think of a way, so instead they have them commit suicide which is kind of cheap really.  It's much more interesting to watch that character struggle through losing everything to get back to a good place. In effect that struggle is drama.  Suicide isn't dramatic because there's no tension there. There's no real struggle. If the character decides to do it, then he does it, which isn't so dramatic. People think it's dramatic because it's in your face.  Unless the movie is about a man who is desperate to kill himself but things keep getting in the way. That could be good, could be dramatic. The story starts out with a guy trying to kill himself, but suddenly there's a knock on the door, the mailman has a package from the neighbour who isn't in. Now he can't kill himself until he gives the package to the neighbour. So later he knocks on his neighbours door and whaddya know, it's a cute girl, she invites him in for dinner, ""No, sorry, I've got something to do!"". He goes back home, prepares to kill himself again but now he can't, his stomach is rumbling. He can't kill himself when he's hungry. So he goes back to his neighbour. ""I've changed my mind, I'll have that dinner."" They have this amazing dinner, flirt etc.  Maybe there's that first sign of happiness in him. Maybe they agree to go out to a movie the next day. Then he goes home, he can't kill himself now, he's agreed to see a movie. etc  Really, this isn't how suicide works, but it works narratively I think. Later maybe the girl tells him she just wants to be friends and he finally attempts suicide."
Screenwriting,3cb60u,dasblog,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:53:24 2015 UTC,"Yes you can, but just be careful with it. Anything to do with mental health is a very delicate subject matter. Make sure you know what you are talking about 100%. Also, don't preach and don't offer easy answers (ie a deeply suicidal boy falls in love with a girl and now he's all better again).   Movies ALWAYS do this with mental health (particularly things like autism) and it annoys the shit out of me. Also, be wary that this sort of subject matter is pretty grim and while there is an audience for deep dark nihilism (woo!) alot of people won't be up for anything that doesn't end with rainbows and sunshine. That doesn't particularly matter at the writing stage, but it does when you try and sell to people who want to make money (producers and the like)."
Screenwriting,3cb60u,neonoirontoast,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:42:30 2015 UTC,"Also writing about suicide and drug deals gone bad is like what 95% of film school students write about.

Screenwriting,3cb9pt,robottaco,3,Mon Jul 6 16:08:28 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good idea to prepare a 3-5 page document to help people see the show. This will include a paragraph detailing the concept, a couple of sentences about each character, focusing on where they're going to go, a couple of paragraphs about the first season's arcs, and a couple of sentences each about 3-5 episodes.   This should be light and breezy, easy to read. It's basically just reassurance that ""yes, there is a series here.""  Sometimes, even with a good pilot, the series is not easy to envision (particularly with premise pilots).   You will be glad you prepared this document down the road. Preparing it may give you ideas that help you improve the pilot (""oh, yeah, if that's going to happen I can set it up like this ...""). Most writers have done some of this work, mentally, before they write the pilot (would you write a pilot before you were sure there was a series there?).   I would strongly encourage you to do this work before submitting. It shouldn't be that hard and can only help you."

I think that you'll get more out of notes the better your work is before you give it to someone, particularly when you're starting out.   People will give you better notes, as well, the more polished things are. If your work is suffering from beginner errors, most people giving your feedback are only going to talk about beginner errors. If you've got second-level errors, people aren't going to talk about sophisticated stuff.   So it can be frustrating to you to get notes which focus on stuff which you would fix if you worked harder, sooner. And it can be frustrating to reviewers if they feel like you didn't work that hard on your script. You should never ask somebody to put more work into their notes than it looks like you put into the script, so if you've got typos, unclear language, or sloppiness, they're going to not work that hard on their notes."

They usually have other jobs and write on the side. I'd suggest you do the same. Your ambition is admirable, but it'll only go so far.   Write a first draft of a screenplay in your spare time. Then the second, then the third and so on. Do this until you have the perfect draft. If that screenplay allows you to become a professional screenwriter then I applaud you, but the chances are it won't.   What I'm trying to say is channel this ambition into writing in your spare time. Enter every competition you see and try to make your screenplays perfect.

And if you're any good, then you can worry about who you know or what connections you have. The HARDEST part of being a writer is writing. Learn how to do that part, then you can worry about making a living at it. Most screenwriters don't make a living at just screenwriting. At least not for the first few sold scripts. Write because you love writing, first and foremost. Because it's a LOT of work. You may find you don't enjoy it long before you get to the part where you compare yourself to others. I have friends who went to grad school for writing and are no better off than me and a few of our other friends who just went to the library and self taught ourselves.

In the end, they prosecuted the head of BHI for petty bullshit, he did actual time, and Sue ended up in Chicago instead of in the Black Hills where she would have brought in huge tourist traffic.

Screenwriting,3cboq5,TroubledAF,3,Mon Jul 6 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"The reality is that when people read a script by a 17-year-old, they're probably not judging it by professional standards. When you read a script by a teenager, you look for things to be encouraging about.   Generally, when people read a script they love, even if they can't make it themselves, they pass it to people they know. These people may not make horror films, but they certainly know agents or managers, as well as other producers. The filmmaking world is small.  People love passing great scripts to their friends. The fact that they didn't offer to pass it on says something about what their praise really means.   Sorry if this makes me sound like a buzzkill.   And look, they're probably not lying to you. They probably did think it was very good - for a script by a 17-year-old. Which means that you have the potential to be somebody who is making great scripts (by pro standards) in your 20s. So the most important thing to do is keep writing. Create more material. Write other types of things (I think there's a lot of value to young writers in writing things they can produce, be they shorts or plays or micro budget features).   And you know, you can go the contest or black list route, where people won't know your age, and see what kind of traction you get. Who knows, I'm just some anonymous guy on the internet.

Screenwriting,3c7wlt,spyhunter200,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:19:10 2015 UTC,It's incredible. Can't believe it's taken me this long to read it.
Screenwriting,3c7wlt,D_B_R,10,Mon Jul 6 15:43:57 2015 UTC,"On page 7, loving it so far.  But can we take this opportunity to talk about grammar? There are a lot of small grammar errors in this, already, and I realize it doesn't matter (especially for James Cameron, especially when he's directing) if the story is comprehensible but.... there are several action lines that are a bit convoluted. Precise actions are described, but fudged up by odd phrases or incorrect word choice, and it actually hampers my mental image of what's happening.  Not a lot of us are even remotely close to the status of James Cameron, and maybe I'm still being a little nitpicky, but when your action lines (or any lines) are improperly phrased, you risk the chance of confusing a reader and taking them out of the story. Which means you risk them not returning to your script, or missing important details that would have otherwise influenced their opinion of your script in a positive way.  Now, to counter what I've just said, the action here is phenomenal. And I'm only on page seven. The great stuff that's going on and, generally, the great detail we get -- outweighs the minor confusion I've experienced through it.  Just commenting and would love to hear other opinions. Welp, back to it.  EDIT Another minor complaint. We get a lot of stuff like this:   Action Line: We go tight on Sarah's reaction. And we see that Silberman is right. She was playing him and it didn't quite work. And she knows she's fucked. She becomes quite pleading.   That's an awful lot of description for what is already mostly available in dialogue and context of the dialogue. This sort of thing would be boo'd in a screenplay submitted by some ""scrub"" on this sub. In my own opinion, everything after ""And we see that Silberman is right."" could be scratched with absolutely no impact on the story. Would omitting it affect the author's tone? Maybe. Maybe not. I'm not forming a definitive opinion on the piece so far, just making observations. I think I'll keep doing edits as I make my way through the piece. It's fun. And I think it's good to challenge really great scripts. If anything, I'll gain some perspective. Side note: I'm not using ""scrub"" in a derogative manner. Just trying to keep it light. I'm a scrub, as far as I'm concerned.  EDIT 2   Action Line: Terminator hauls ass at keep John in sight.   Really? This is what I'm talking about, although this is to a lesser degree and not as confusing so much as it is slightly jarring.  Then later, in the arcade, we have OFFICER X questioning kids about the whereabouts of John. A kid approaches John and lets him know that a cop is looking for him. There's an action line that reads, ""Sarah has taught him that cops are bad news."" We didn't need that at all. The kid just jacked $300 from an ATM, which his mother, Sarah, taught him to do. That's enough information by itself -- which is brilliant, everything, all of that, besides that punctuating sentence, ""Sarah has taught him that cops are bad news.""  EDIT 3  After the river / aqueduct chase sequence, John says, ""This is deep..."" after learning of the Terminator's identity. Cut to... night, where the conversation picks up exactly where it ended in the last scene. I'm not judging this transition, just having a chuckle, as a lot of movies seem to skip forward in time with characters continuing the exact same conversation as they were at the last setting. It isn't a bad thing, per say. Just noticeable these days. It's funny to think that John says, ""This is deep..."" and then awkward silence for X hours until randomly, after the sun sets, he suddenly remembers what he was talking about and says, ""So this other guy? He's a terminator too...""   Action Line: (Don't go away. We'll find out what happened in a moment)   I'm seriously against this parenthetical. Something dramatic was implied in the same paragraph, right before this parenthetical. Don't apologize, Cameron. We know you're setting up drama. No need for the parenthesis. Don't underestimate your audience. .... So far, all the extra fluff in this script screams, ""HOW AWESOME IS THIS?"" We get it. Maybe back when this was written, this was necessary to sell it, with it being a sequel and all. But ugh. I don't like this line. It's proud and showy in a way that, strictly writing-wise, I am not fond of. Also, I'm editing several observations into each individual bolded edit. Otherwise there'd be way too many bolded edits. Just letting y'all know.  EDIT 4  Obligatory callout on a PLOOOOT HOOOOOLE!   Terminator: It can't form complex machines. Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts. It doesn't work that way. But it can form solid metal shapes.   Pretty sure the human body, plus clothing, is more complex than a gun or a bomb. But I digress.... It's a small cop-out, but I don't mind. This is a story about an awesomely evil robot, let's not get too fixed on the details.  ... More seriously, the T-1000 then walks into a less inconsequential plot hole. It goes through John's things and discovers, gasp, momentos of John's mother. But wait a second... if the Connor family is the key to the apocalypse, and the Terminator already knows of Sarah, then... why wouldn't ""Officer X"" know of her already? Did it... forget?

The T1000 is not changing to a human, but assuming the appearance, like a thin veneer. All it has to do is mirror the texture bumps of appearance. The many injuries to the T1000 reveal this, as well as its shapeshifting agony in its final scene.  edit:    ... More seriously, the T-1000 then walks into a less inconsequential plot hole.

But wait a second... if the Connor family is the key to the apocalypse, and the Terminator already knows of Sarah, then... why wouldn't ""Officer X"" know of her already? Did it... forget?    Also, the memento is a clue that John values his mother. Since he knows the Terminators know of her, the T1000 can calculate that Conner will attempt to communicate with his mother, and also that his mother can be used tactically against him (as it finally does in the forge scenes near the end)."

I think part of it is that I'm experiencing that.  It's a feeling like all the many years of reading books and scripts, thinking about it, obsessing over it, doing the work of thinking of concepts and stories, etc., is finally all adding up in a tangible way. I'm able to come up with characters and plot (thus, story) much more easily than I could before. It could have been a confidence thing... I think I was poisoned by a lot of the ""expert"" stuff I was gobbling up, then finally stopped attaching so much importance to it, and started trusting my own gut a lot more.

But I've recently started an idea that makes me really excited about the charters I have planned. And it's exactly how you described it -- I'm more experienced with world building and scenario -writing, and my work has always fallen short because I was missing the vital piece--character development--and this new project has just been so much fun.

I didn't even realize there was a book but the script was very different from what you described in the book, while the movie was different from the original script that I have.  The excerpt was true in the version I read a few years ago, that the incident was started by a missile destroying the satellite that set off a cloud of debris and a chain reaction.  All the main events that Sandra's character went through were the same, but the events the history and what caused it all were very different.  In the film her daughter was dead, whereas her daughter was waiting for her on Earth in the script.    The main sequence in the script was that there was some military or political turmoil on Earth that put them out of contact with ""Houston"" and was starting attacks on various communications networks.  At the turning point (Act 3) of the script actually much of North America goes dark in a massive blackout, giving her the strength to continue fighting in order to get back to Earth to save her daughter.    Now I want to find the book and read what changed, I really loved the movie, but honestly think I liked the script better, hard to choose though.  The script just had more mystery as to the events unfolding which also added to the importance of her quest as more than just surviving, but of saving her daughter from the chaos she was witnessing from the solitude of space.  I think I might sit down and read the script again for fun."

Screenwriting,3car4l,RichardMHP,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:51:40 2015 UTC,"I would have to agree with your analysis. The differences between book and final film are so large and definitive that without that ""missing link"" of a Gerritson draft that would, itself, be a massive departure from the nature and story contained in the book, I simply can't see how a Guild arbitration would do anything other than keep her name off of the final product. A ""based on the book 'Gravity' by Tess Gerritsen"" credit wouldn't really be appropriate crediting, either, even with such a missing link showing the clear line, because of the huge distance between one story and the other.   While you point out the similarities, and I agree that they're certainly there as you describe them, the execution of those ideas is very different. There's not a line of dialogue, or a single characterization, or even a completely coherent plot point (in terms of circumstances and results) that matches up from one to the other.   All that being said, while I can certainly see the possibility of the opposite, I for one can see the film germinating independently of Gerritsen's story, no matter how many script revisions it might've gone through at New Line. Independent creation is not an uncommon event, and the elements that are similar are so general as to be fairly logical ideas. Once you've got the premise ""unlikely astronaut is stuck in orbit after a disaster"", then a lot of those similarities flow. The only real evidence any of us have seen of Cuaron's attachment to the Goldenberg adaptation of Gerritsen's book is Gerritsen's contention that it ""must've"" been so because all these guys have worked together before and her agent heard something somewhere. But, frankly, if the number of people I know and have worked with was evidence of my attachment to projects, then I'd have had a hand in about 30% of the movies that have come out in theaters this year alone. It means nothing.   Ultimately, what I find rather perplexing about this whole thing is the way Gerritsen has gone about publicizing it, and in doing so has conflated the two, ultimately independent issues involved.

I don't mean the fact that she was publicizing it, just the way that she conflated things in the manner that she did while she was publicizing it. That's all.   I tend to agree that it doesn't seem like she and her lawyers grasped that there were separate issues. The filings are filled with conflations, jumping back and forth from it being a contract issue to being a plagiarism issue, using the one and then the other to defend inaction in various directions, and weirdly at that. In particular, the idea(put forward by her on her blog) that she can't pursue a plagiarism case against WB because New Line still holds the license to the works is spurious, at best, because such a block would only hold true if one accepts that the license passes to WB along with the contractual obligations, and that's precisely what WB says is not the case. So WB's own defense against her Breach of Contract allegation is what makes it possible for her to seek a plagiarism cause, and as the originator of the work she would still have standing to seek redress no matter what third-party held the license to adapt the work. Especially if that party wasn't seeking such redress themselves.   But, I suspect that either she or her lawyers knows full well that they'd probably lose such a case, because as you and I have found, there just isn't all that much actionable similarity between the two works. Proving a breach of copyright or the like would be incredibly hard in this case. But, I think they'd have a better chance of getting to the discovery phase than they had with this tactic, and in doing so might have gotten WB to show that the license (and thus contractual obligations) to Gerritsen's book were transferred to them when they bought New Line. Which would have then allowed them to pursue a Breach claim.   But, that's pure speculation from a non-lawyer, so take it with a huge dose of salt."

That's all.    Ah, I see.  Well, the attorneys took the shotgun approach, not so uncommon in a civil suit, hoping to get something by the court. Their client doesn't have virtually unlimited resources like Warner's does.    In particular, the idea(put forward by her on her blog) that she can't pursue a plagiarism case against WB because New Line still holds the license to the works is spurious, at best, because such a block would only hold true if one accepts that the license passes to WB along with the contractual obligations, and that's precisely what WB says is not the case.   I'm missing something.  I recall she said Warner's has the rights to the book, which is why it's not a copyright case. New Line doesn't exist as a separate corporate entity any longer, afaik.  It occurs to me that Warner's can only prove it holds the rights to her book if they produce the take-over agreement, which seems to be what they were fighting all along.   Maybe she should see the rights to some indie producer for a buck and let Warner's sue them. (Wait. I think I just wandered off into Fantasyland ---) I do think she could pursue a writing credit, though.   She probably has a lot of legal avenues she can pursue. But she shouldn't.  I do think Warner's and Cuaron treated her like shit, but what's new?  No one will convince me the movie they shot didn't incorporate elements of her script. Which might just be my personal cop bias against coincidence."

It occurs to me that Warner's can only prove it holds the rights to her book if they produce the take-over agreement, which seems to be what they were fighting all along.   Exactly. WB's position is that New Line remains its own corporate entity, it was not simply absorbed by WB. Therefor WB isn't necessarily beholden to New Line's contractual obligations. They further argued that their picture ""Gravity"" and Gerritsen's book ""Gravity"" were unrelated.   Gerritsen's attorneys argued that they had simply absorbed New Line and all of its contracts, but couldn't back up that argument with any evidentiary support. Which they needed, because simply acquiring ownership of a company and completely absorbing it are two different things.  (good pop-cultural example of this for reference: this last season of Mad Men. SC&A had been purchased by McCann, but was not a part of McCann, which is why they and McCann could have conflicting client accounts. When McCann decided to just fold SC&A into itself, thus fully absorbing it, many of those conflicts had to be dealt with.)  That's why it always seemed like a weird way of going about it. My lawyers have advised me on a few occasions that you should only sue over issues you can prove with a paper trail, and assume things you can't prove are not in existence. Thus, if you can show definitively that WB's ""Gravity"" is based on her script, but can't show that WB actually owns the license, then you go after them for plagiarism, make them prove it isn't such because of the license they have, then go after them for breach of contract. By just assuming that her contract wound up being with WB without being able to support it, her lawyers really shot her ""it's based on my book"" argument right in the foot.   I like the idea of selling the rights anew and forcing WB into a tough position w/ regards to their own copyright protection, but she can't. She sold the license to New Line for perpetuity (which is apparently where it remains to this day)."
Screenwriting,3ca6ea,samirv,8,Mon Jul 6 08:37:09 2015 UTC,"Read scripts from shows you know.  It's really useful to read the script, watch the movie again, and then go back and do both at the same time.  Look out specifically for learning how a scene is constructed.  A scene in this sense is a single dramatic idea.  Like ""Bill asks Kate out for dinner.""  It doesn't matter if he chases her through three locations, it's one scene.  Also, if he asks her out on the factory floor, but then his boss interrupts and presents another dramatic idea -- you're onto a new scene without changing your location.  Really study how scenes are built, then try to write some.  It sometimes helps to practice writing scenes using the characters and world of a movie you know.  Like writing new scenes for THE GODFATHER or THE DARK KNIGHT.  I think sometimes there is an over-emphasis on reading and watching at the expense of writing.  My rule of thumb is one-for-one: study a script/movie, then write a script.  read a book, write a script.  As a writer, productivity is the skill with the biggest payoff. All challenges fall before the force of writing a shit-ton of pages on a regular basis.  Find more excuses to write scenes.  Find more opportunities to write screenplays.

Screenwriting,3c9wnr,arlyax,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:19:08 2015 UTC,"after skimming through the script I kind of see what angle/theme you are going for with this.   it seems you are going for a psychological thriller with this one.   in my mind the story would be more about leading the audience on, casting doubt on the protagonist so that the audience is questioning if the bridge is even real and thinking more along the lines that it is perhaps some imaginary coping mechanism created by Reis  that would be the set up. act one.   and after the call to action... the audience will be thinking that the bridge is real and Reis is trapped in act two  until the audiences is back to thinking it is all some imaginary construct in act three....  which leads to the ending. where you reveal the absolute truth, or reveal more ambiguity.   anyways after the set up....  where you take it from there, and how you plan on leading the audience on, is something I am very curious about.  some thoughts....  if the machine is real and Reis successfully traveled to a parallel world (for some reason) in the set up....  he could be trapped in this parallel world. And his goal would be to get back to the origin world (somehow) but everyone thinks he is batshit crazy, and perhaps the Reis of the PW has some warrants or something....  and if the bridge is real what happened to the Reis of the PW? is he already dead? or on the run? perhaps the other Reis phases out? it's some kind of law of physics. there cant be two Reis's occupying one world?   or you could allow the two Reis characters to occupy and run amok in one world and spin all kinds of interesting things out of it. for starters they could have some telepathic connection? like Sense8. and the Reis of the parallel world could have a vastly different personality...like a serial killer for instance  have you considered having Reis narrate?        perhaps the Reis of the PW delivers the ""call to action"" and helps Reis escape from the psych ward. and the Reis of the PW would have a very simple goal. he would be attempting to escape to the other world leaving the traveling Reis stranded in the PW world.   although that would complicate the filming process significantly.   but it could all still be some imaginary multiple personality thing. which is why i mentioned narration. to pull that multiple personality off with style you would need an unreliable narrator like fight club or Mr Robot.   i also think that if the bridge is real it would be more interesting if there was a mission behind it. a mission with clear objectives. something beyond the basic ""explore the unknown"" for the first time. instead if the bridge is real Reis and his crew have been doing it for awhile and they are up to something shady or greedy like theft or manipulating fate or something...  also if the machine is real there could be some object or gadget that is to be used to get back to the origin world. An object or gadget Reis lost or is broke?  or perhaps if you die in the PW you are forced back to the origin world and your duplicate dies in your place or something?  the idea of dying in the PW and being forced back to the origin world could play well if you want to cast even more doubt on Reis having some deep psychological issues. that would be his imaginative suicide fantasy for instance.   also i skimmed through your lookbook. none of the movies you used seemed to really capture the scope of what you are going for with Bridge.   If my intuition is correct what you are going for is more in the vein of K-PAX but with a darker tone. and instead of some alien or imaginative coping mechanism from losing his family you have a traveler from a parallel world who might have accidentally murdered his brother.    food for thought...."

It's tone and style and pacing.   You're right to be concerned if you are not expressing your story as yourself. Unique voice is an appreciated commodity in screenwriting as in all other forms.

Screenwriting,3c7wpp,Mynock33,6,Sun Jul 5 21:20:48 2015 UTC,"I have a great idea, how does it leap off the page and onto the screen? Some good questions to ask yourself:  How much experience do I have with making a film?  Have you directed? Have you written a screenplay before(even if it hasn't been optioned)? A treatment? What experience do you have with the movie industry? None? Some? Home movies?   Weigh these considerations heavily, as although you might think that you have a good vision in your head, it takes true technical knowledge of film to direct your idea and foresee its editing to completion. If you don't have experience, seek it out. Volunteer for student/indie films. Craigslist or your local area's film forum is a good start.  How much control do I want to have over this idea?  Filmmaking is at its best, a collaborative art form. Do you want to be the driving force for the whole project? Or do you want to hand the screenplay over to other people for creation so you can get started on the next idea? If you feel the need to be a part of every step of the process, consider the budget and start a kickstarter/indegogo campaign. You'll need producing/financial experience as well for this. It may also take years worth of investment for you to complete this project depending on the size/scope.  How do I market this idea?  The best way to get exposure for an idea is to send a logline, treatment, and/or completed screenplay to as many film festivals as you can. Even if you don't win, your idea gets into the hands of real people in the industry. Seek out Blacklist as well. Exposure is everything. Get feedback (even if you have to pay extra) from festivals whenever possible or your idea won't be the best version of itself that it can be.  How motivated am I?   Anyone can create a spark, but it takes real effort to cultivate that into a flame. The world is filled with the ""idea man"" that believes thinking is doing. You have a great idea, so what? Who doesn't? I remember my uncle telling me that he ""invented the Compact Disk"" in 1980, well before its debut in 1989. I asked him why he was still poor, working a manual labor job after inventing the CD and—well, he couldn't answer me. He went into detail on how he was talking with his brothers about how eventually, we'd find a way to store information on small, magnetic disks. Did he invent the CD? or did he just have a vague idea that eventually became born?   Even if you JUST want to be involved in writing the screenplay, it can take years and quite a bit of money before your idea becomes a movie, and that's if you're lucky. You'll face rejection in the form of silence, and there will be people that think you're absolute shit.   The best advice I can offer after considering all of the above is this, if you want to be a screenwriter/storyteller, don't bet on one idea. It may not be good and even if it is, it may not get made. Branch out, write many scripts, enter them in film festivals. You can consider making a short film or pilot if you can muster the right crew with the same passion and motivation, but don't expect to be able to gather together a whole studio just because you think you have, or others have told you that you have a good idea."

(and don't lecture me about Anakin, he's not the main character of ANH, even if he's the main character of the overall saga so far).  If he's not the main character of A New Hope, who is?

They're comic relief, but also a proxy for the viewer's experience. They're not dashing rogues or fearless princesses or budding space samurai. They're afraid and bicker and they're clumsy.  And they have no character arc. From Episode I-Episode VI, they have not changed one bit. They're still the same 3P0 and R2.  And that's fine! It's not a knock against them. They're wonderful characters who help add a touch of humor to the films.  Plus, they don't do anything. At least, they don't do anything to push the narrative forward. They don't make choices integral to the movie that sets things in motion (unless you count R2's one moment of rebellion when he goes off looking for Obi-Wan).  In contrast, Luke decides to seek out Ben. Luke decides to leave Tatooine (this is the key plot point setting the entire OT saga in motion), Luke decides they must rescue the princess, Luke decides to become a pilot, Luke decides to trust the force over technology and his actions blow up the Death Star and save the day.  A main character makes decisions that drive the plot forward, for good or for ill. Luke's decisions shape A New Hope."

One example would be how in A New Hope, C3PO mentions how he has never been one for telling stories. Namely because he is a protocol droid, built for literal translation. He has a large lack of understanding in emotional expression within the context of conversations which is supposed to be kind of funny considering it's his purpose to understand how to interact with organics. By the second half of Return of the Jedi though, he is telling a very exciting story of their adventures and is hitting every emotional high and low, giving the Ewoks and the viewer a clearly enthralling story even if we don't have the translation for it. Subtle, but change is there.  Still, without question, Luke is the main. People would be crazy to argue that."
Screenwriting,3c7zis,DigitalEvil,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:18:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure 3PO changes that much, quite frankly, and I don't think the fact that he tells a story points to actual character development, but it is a change, I'll admit that.  I guess I was thinking more in terms of his defining traits like nervousness, obliviousness and prudishness don't really budge from Episode I-Episode VI.  Still, you're right.

And if we don't care whether or not a character achieves, then the story sucks or the character just isn't very important.  Everything about the movies facilitates Luke's growth more than any other.

I've never seen a Van Damme movie, unfortunately, so I don't get that example.  I'm willing to hear your argument about Vader, though I don't even remember him changing or growing much in the IV. But I still hold that Luke is the main character. He suffers trials and tribulations, he is the stock character we the audience project ourselves onto, and we follow his story more closely than Vader's. Vader is the primary antagonist (with the Emporer being the big bad), and thus has a large role and development of his own, but he is not the center focus of any of the original films."

As far as the Campbell/monomyth that always gets trotted out, Lucas only read ""Hero"" after he'd written drafts of Star Wars. And the movie certainly doesn't cleave to the monomyth structure. Probably because Campbell's monomyth structure is of questionable value. Frank Herbert, who probably had a much bigger impact on Lucas and the film than Campbell did, was not a fan of heroes in general and Dune was about the failure of the idea of heroes.  You can see Lucas took up this idea heavily in ESB and RotJ.  Luke, still high off his big moment in ANH, thinks he's a savior. Against all advice he goes to save people. He saves zero people.  He has to be saved by the people he was trying to save. What does he learn?  That he's not the hero of the story. Vader's the only one who can kill the Emperor."

Campbell's monomyth structure is taught even today in screenwriting, so I question where you say it's not of much value.  You still haven't produced a single piece of evidence Luke isn't the main character in A New Hope. (not ESB, not ROTJ, A New Hope).  Again, every decision he makes drives the movie. Every decision he makes drives ESB and ROTJ as well. Just because he isn't always successful doesn't mean he's not the main character.  If he were always successful, this would be a pretty boring fucking series, in fact. You're supposed to set your characters up for failure.  And, again, you're bringing in facets of ESB and ROTJ when the question is whether Luke is the main character of A New Hope. Which he demonstrably is."

Good luck.   every decision he makes drives the movie.   No. He refuses the call per the monomyth.   He crosses the threshold when he returns to the farm.  That drives the story in a small way.  The guardians aren't actually there, so he skips that part.  The burned out farm is the belly of the whale. Had he not removed the restraining bolt, he'd be dead too.  That's like his second  biggest decision in the whole movie. Driven by lust, he falls for R2's bullshit and meets Kenobi, etc etc. He then makes the decision to leave, but it's a no-brainer. In effect the Empire decided for him.  He doesn't locate the Princess, he doesn't even know she's there. He has no intent until R2D2 conveniently ""finds"" her.  He does make a small decision at that point, driven by lust again.  But it's moot, Vader knows Kenobi is there and assumes he's trying to rescue Leia and recover the location of the plans from her.  Vader would love it if he could eliminate Kenobi, who he views as the only real threat and still somehow allow the princess to escape and return to the rebel base. Vader cares about the plans, more than Tarkin, but only so much. Vader probably thinks that without someone like Kenobi around to exploit any weaknesses in the design, the death star is safe. And he'd be right. He doesn't know who Luke is. He doesn't know he's force-sensitive. And he doesn't know Kenobi can still guide Luke from beyond the grave.    Suppose Vader captured them. The base would still be hidden. The death star wouldn't be an immediate threat. The only reason they have to engage it is because they led it right to the base.  And really all blowing it up does is save the base. The Empire is just going to build a better death star every time someone manages to blow the old death star up."

Professional screenwriters regularly bring it up as a model for writing stories. Would you like to me to link several to you? I can.  And Luke's decisions drive the movie, no matter how you try and trivialize them. It's that simple. He decides to find Ben, he decides to leave the planet, he decides to save the princess, he decides to join the rebellion as a pilot, he decides to let go and trust the force.  I'm not sure if you're just trying to be ""cool internet contrarian guy,"" but your retcon of Star Wars isn't remotely persuasive. Luke is the main character of A New Hope -- whether you like it or not -- and nothing you have written has contradicted that in the least.  Nor have you put forward any sort of convincing argument as to whom the main character of A New Hope is.  I don't know what you're getting at, quite frankly.

Which inspired ""the memo"", which is more based on Star Wars than Campbell. Prior to that, most people thought Campbell was a nut, a wannabe Frazier.  But believe what you want. Go perform the mental contortions necessary to fit Star Wars or The Matrix or The Odyssey into the hero's journey structure.  None of them fit but that doesn't matter. And if you believe Campbell, the Aeneid can't be a blueprint for the monomyth, but an instantiation of it. At any rate, HWaTF has taken on a biblical quality, you believe it, you only allow critical discussion of it that presumes it must be true. And that discussion amounts to lots of massaging to bring the wacky text inline with the real world, magicking away inconsistencies, cabalistically changing the focus of the whole discussion in an effort to misdirect from the blatant absurdity.  So isn't it an incredibly simple exercise to point to each step of the monomyth in Star Wars, since they map one to one? Go ahead and illuminate everyone. Except you won't, convincingly. Because you can't, because it's not the monomyth. It's Hidden Fortress*Stagecoach + Dam Busters or something.  Hey since they  must all be the monomyth too,  bonus points for mapping them onto it!  Just go do that, because this is a pretty low-level, boring conversation and if you knew anything about Lucas and how this all went down, you'd know that he wrote a silly hero type story at a time when hero stories were completely unfashionable and then, rich as fuck but feeling a little embarrassed and silly about how blatant and childish it was, he went back and undid all that he had tried to do with darker, Dune-like stories that denied the hero."

We're introduced to a completely new world in every sense of the notion. And it's done showing very high stakes and tension.   Then, we're given a bit of a breather and dumped into the mundane (well, mundane in relative terms). We're shown the equivalent of a dreamer farm boy stuck in a one-horse town. That's the juxtaposition. It's a huge shift from what we've just seen. The drama literacy comes in that, instinctively, we know we're not being shown this guy by accident. It makes us wonder what he's going to have to do with all the mayhem from the opening stanza.  It achieves two very important tasks: it sets up the world in an exciting way, and it clues to the audience we're about to watch an epic journey, both in terms of pure plot but also just as importantly in character."

They all follow a similar structure:  The story begins with a Herald, escaping from The War, bringing word to the Hero to answer the Call To Adventure and Meet The Mentor.    Sometimes, The Herald undergoes their own Heroic Journey to bring the Call to the Hero.  In the case of SW, R2 is the Herald sent by the Princess with the Call To Adventure.  He escapes The War, faces his own Trials and Adversities with Allies and Enemies.  One of those Allies is Luke.  We don't need to meet Luke until the Herald comes upon him, and he takes over the story.  The Matrix is another, less extreme example of this structure.  Trinity is the Herald, escaping from The War to bring the Hero the Call to Meet the Mentor.  The Mentor Calls the Hero to Adventure -- and the Hero refuses.    We don't meet Neo until page 9."

Screenwriting,3c7zis,Psyladine,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:48:49 2015 UTC,"I think this is always a valid question - in fact, it's the right question. When something doesn't follow the obvious formula, to ask why it works.   So let's dig into this a little bit. Luke getting R2D2 is what we would call the inciting incident. It's the thing that happens to him which launches him into the story. The problem is, in Star Wars, that Luke's story, before the arrival of R2D2, isn't that interesting.   Different films handle the ""stuff before the inciting incident isn't interesting"" problem differently. For example, in Alien, the inciting incident is the very first thing that happens in the movie (the ship gets a message and drops out of hyperspace). We don't need to watch the crew before then, because one or two well-drawn scenes with them, through the course of the story, tell us who they are.   So, similarly, we don't need a lot of Luke before R2D2. Again, we're able to get what we need about him from one or two scenes that happen after that. So there's no reason to start HIS story earlier. You could star the film there, but then you're faced with the question of:  How do we get the information about these droids, the stakes of the world, etc into the film. It could be done expositionally - the droids could tell him, or Obi Won could tell him more than he already does (although there's already a big chunk of exposition early between the two of them).  Or - we could show the audience in a thrilling sequence.   Which of those sounds more exciting to you?  Getting in the habit of asking yourself ""what does this choice accomplish?"" and ""what are the other choices available to accomplish the same thing?"" will often reveal answers to questions like this."
Screenwriting,3c7zis,HotspurJr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:34:08 2015 UTC,"From Michael Hague:  ""The first 10% of your screenplay is what I term the SETUP, during which you must transport the reader from the real world into the world you’ve created, as well as get them emotionally involved with the setting and characters before your main story line begins. While many films open with the hero living his or her everyday life, you may want to consider preceding your hero introduction with a PROLOGUE. Here you begin with some outside time, location or character, in order to draw the reader into the story more quickly or powerfully, and to create anticipation of what is to come.  One type of prologue is a NEMESIS INTRODUCTION:  A Nemesis introduction opens with the character who will become the greatest obstacle to the hero achieving his goal. This could be a villain (The Joker in The Dark Knight), an opponent (Apollo Creed in Rocky), a romantic rival (Cal in Titanic or Zachary in Wedding Crashers), or simply a character in opposition to the hero (Mozart in Amadeus or Raymond in Rain Man). By introducing the Nemesis before your hero, you open with immediate conflict, you create anticipation of the jeopardy that awaits the hero when she must face the far more powerful (or far more evil) Nemesis of the screenplay, and you create curiosity about what will bring them together, and how the hero will ultimately prevail. This is why we are introduced to the Joker in the opening sequence of The Dark Knight, and why we meet the cyborg from the future in The Terminator before we see Sarah Connor living her everyday life as a waitress.  |||||  So, it ""works"" because we meet Darth Vader, the nemesis, and start off with conflict. And set up a bunch of stuff in the meantime.  That, and what 120_pages said about the Hero with a Thousand Faces and the Herald."

Actually, I kinda love those films. You probably will need to subtly thread some clues into the earlier parts, just so it's not a ridiculous tone-shift. As you mentioned, Safety Not Guaranteed does this really well.   Something I can see an issue with however, is the use of time travel as 'only' a plot device. If you're going for a grounded, realistic take on the story, something as far-out as time travel has to be the main attraction, ESPECIALLY if it's introduced late. If you start the film clearly setting up a world that's like our own, but people can time travel, it's less of an issue. But for what you're aiming towards, it can't just be something the character uses to propel the plot forward. It needs to be dealt with the appropriate 'holy-shit-time-travel' gravitas that's needed, so people reading the script won't wonder why characters are so chill about being able to go through freaking time!"

Others can be parents, coworkers, neighbors. Weather is also a good antagonist.   There has to be a force that is fighting against your protagonist. There has to be drama.

Why not look at other films that have long time spans (I don't know, Goodfellas, the Godfather?) and see how they do it. It isn't by montage.   I'd advise writing the key scenes as much as possible. Use costume and setting and voiceover to get the change in time across and catch the audience up. You should be showing us the important things that happen across the time period, those that cause later events.  Maybe think about why you want to write this script. What are the key scenes you need to be in the film? And work back from that, what needs to happen to set them up and give them the gravitas they require?  Also, maybe read Sorkin's Steve Jobs script. It condenses his life down to three moments before product launches. Incredibly spartan, but gives you a good sense of the man and what's happened in the interim.

It could make them feel altruistically good about themselves -""I'm a poor beginner and I need a favor."" But even then, either make it easier for them to see the material, or make yourself compelling enough so that they'll message you to ask.  Thus far, all I know is that you want help, and you seem genuinely resistant to the idea of communicating anything to the reader, which makes me question how much you care about creating a targeted emotional experience in a story.   You're probably a nice person. You probably put effort into this story. You probably hope it'll make people happy (or applicable emotion). But you're COMMUNICATING like someone who isn't any of those things."

Because you're putting too much detail. Detail that we don't need, at the expense of detail that we do. Describing the crash isn't necessary, we know what a crash looks like. Say he's covered in blood and oil if you want, but do it once. Do not tell us he's getting frustrated, because how do I film that? Give him action or dialogue instead.  I think you need to read some scripts. You aren't writing a novel, but your prose says you are. Do a search on here, you'll find a collection of 300 scripts. Peruse them. Chinatown, Alien, Aliens, Unforgiven are scripts that are often recommended.  Your two pages could be:    OVER BLACK: The soft sound of the wind. With it come music, an idling engine, a persistent dripping.  EXT. MITTE CITY - NIGHT  A street, empty but for strewn wreckage.  An overturned car.  The single occupant struggles to release his seat belt. He falls into a pool of blood and petrol, soiling his BLACK SUIT.  From the glove compartment he takes a gun before dragging himself through the door's window.  Black Suit crawls, every metre an effort. The sounds of the wreckage fall away with distance.    He attempts to stand, cannot. He groans involuntarily.  A new sound, an engine. It draws Black Suit's attention.   He tries to rise again, eyes looking down the road, and makes to his feet this time.  Blue lights are approaching. He stares them down, adjusts his tie, does up his jacket, concealing a black-red stain on his shirt.   But, I think even that is a lot of description. I'd probably break up the voice over and slip it between the action lines.  And your ending: he's trying to get away from the car, so he keeps walking down the road? How does that work? This isn't the whole scene is it? It's not very gripping and it ends without the promise of anything more to come. Breaking Bad opens in a similar way, but has Walter step out to confront the vehicles gun in hand. We can't wait to see what happens next and we're gutted when it's held off."

I really mean it.   It does feel like you're trying to be very wordy. I find that when writing, I constantly try to read as though I'm reading the words for the first time. I need to make sure the text flows on a first read-through. People won't reread sentences if they get confused, they put the document down.   For example, I didn't realize Black Suit was a person. I imagined a creepy animated suit like from The Invisible Man. I had to reread it a few times. Just introduce the character!  ""We hear a man grunting and wheezing - it is a heavyset man in a dusty black suit (Black Suit Man) struggling to pull himself out of the broken window of the overturned car.""  I get the feeling you're very young and want to add - I'm an attorney and write in my spare time, all of my life is basically working to write as clearly and engagingly as possible. The sign of a good, ""professional"" writer is always, always, using the clearest and simplest language in any situation.   All writers will tell you the same, it's probably the most fundamental rule. Be clear and edit, edit, edit, edit.   If you want a really good example of impressively tight writing, check out the Frozen script. Every single scene, beat, line, etc. in that movie serves like, four purposes.

The important thing is to just let the reader know this is a person and give them some idea what they're looking at - remember this is a visual format!  ""...dusty black suit, BLACK SUIT MAN, struggling...""  Probably the most valuable thing you could do is just pick a clearer name for him. Personally I think ""Black Suit Man"" is a little clearer than ""Black Suit."" It's not exciting and I don't actually like it, but it's clear! It should also be fine for dialog."

Just fade in on them and we are them until we have a better choice.  If there are choices, the audience picks someone to whom they relate. When in doubt, they follow their pity. Fade in on a raccoon being chased by a bear, we are the raccoon. Fade in on a room full of ambassadors. The President walks in and trips on the carpet. We are the President.

So many people come out of movies saying how could I ever care about that character he was so unlikable, or that movie was doomed to fail because non of the characters were likable. People say this especially for protagonists. Was Daniel Day Lewis likable in There Will Be Blood? Were you not engaged with what he did? A compelling character is a compelling character. Walter White does countless horrible things, but we never stop being riveted and in many ways never stop rooting for him because he is the main character.  Sure, some stories require a likable character. Most of the time you'll want to like the leads in a romantic comedy. However, when you think the problem was that he was not likable, most of the time the real issue was that he just was not a good character period."

I can switch the words accessible and relatable and that makes sense. It seems like your argument is that relatable has a connotation of ""seemingly connected to the every day,"" and if that were the case, I'd agree with you.  Relatability can also mean ""I relate to that person - I see where they're coming from"" and if one is using that definition, then your statement reads as less correct.

My definition of relatability is that there is something familiar about the character that people connect with. A similar hobby, personality trait, life experience, etc.  My argument was that it's not about relatability, but rather understanding. That the character's actions are justified enough to the viewer that the viewer can understand why the character did it, even if they have nothing else they connect with on the character. It's why people find documentaries on serial killers and such so fascinating even if they don't relate to that person's life or personality in any way -- they want to understand the why of things.  Edit - and I disagree that accessibility and relatability are interchangeable. Accessibility to me means I am given access to the character's motivation, relatability means I find some connection with the character. Not trying to argue, just trying to clarify my POV."

This sounds fine to me because to me relate basically means you have the ability to sympathize with someone, not necessarily empathize (which is putting yourself emotionally in their shoes).

Empathy and sympathy are not the same thing, but to identify with is actually more applicable to screenwriting than empathy is.   I agree. I think if a screenwriting can empathize with their characters they'll write them better, but the viewer, however, only needs to understand them enough to potentially sympathize, not empathize.  My definitions:   Relate: Being able to identify with. I don't naturally think sympathize with, but you're right, it does fit. Empathy: Being able to emotionally put yourself in someone else's shoes and imagine what it would feel like if you were them. Sympathy: Understanding why they are upset or feeling what they're feeling, but not being able to fully imagine what it would be like to experience it yourself."

The main difference is that with an animated feature, you don't have to worry as much about budget concerns for crazy visuals.  As far as theatrical releases are concerned, live action features can be made on the cheap. Whereas a hand-drawn animated feature varies widely, and a cg film starts at around $100 million."
Screenwriting,3c74v1,Letterstothor,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:14:18 2015 UTC,"A live action script is about 1 page pr. minute, while an animated script is about 2 pages pr. minute. The reason for this is that when you write an live action script, you create images for the director, while you ARE the director when writing an animated script.    The animator is the camera, and this camera only captures what is on the page. So you add in all the big and small details, all the quirky little thing, into the script, in order to make the animator's job easier. The more you flesh out the scenes, the easier it is for him to contribute with some of his own, without him having to create the world by himself.    In short, a live action camera captures a world already here, while an animated camera/animator captures the world on your pages."

Screenwriting,3c5w4p,ChadBrostorm,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:11:47 2015 UTC,"I think the free version limits how many screenplays or pages you can work on, and you can only import scripts as read only."
Screenwriting,3c5w4p,gaylordqueen69,2,Sun Jul 5 03:21:29 2015 UTC,"I use Celtx Script.  It's okay.  It had a recent update which fixed some long-standing issues -- notably, it doesn't leave widowed scene headings and widowed character/orphaned dialogue. It's perhaps a little overzealous at times to compensate, however.  It also has not fixed some issues I've had in the past: switching out of the app and switching back in reliably causes it to crash ... the options in the top right are either useless or put in the wrong place ... the only reliable way to navigate a large screenplay is to use the scene selector, because scrolling takes forever ... there's no way to organize your files ... the page count gets drastically reduced when switching to Celtx on the computer ... the only reliable way to transfer a script to Celtx on the computer is to email it to yourself as text ... if you try to sync your scripts, the app will ""load"" for sometimes 20-30 minutes and then say there were problems with every single script in the roster ...  Plus at least one new problem: It automatically prompts you to sync each time you boot it up, meaning if I want to use the program, I have to cancel the prompt, and if I don't, it starts automatically syncing and then it's utterly unusable.  I've tried using WriterDuet on the iPad and never had much luck because the interface is too fiddly and prone to making changes that can't be undone. Last time I checked there were some bugs, too, but knowing Guy, he's almost certainly fixed them. He's quite good about responding to feedback, so I'd hazard a guess that the experience has improved significantly since the last time I gave it a shot.  Of course, you won't always have an internet connection. Nor will you always want to rely on that connection when you're writing, or struggle to learn the ropes of a program that was designed for computers primarily. If there are major changes, they won't be optimized for the mobile experience, meaning you might be lagging behind the experience other people get. Also it's difficult to scroll. Scrolling is always an issue on mobile devices. I don't know why nobody's figured it out yet. Someone must.  I've attempted using Fountain formatting on basic text editors. Don't use Notes -- it freezes up, especially when using a bluetooth keyboard. Plaintext is good, but if you leave the app it defaults to the base screen, meaning you'll have to navigate your file trees to re-open the file you were working with. It also relies on the default scrolling method, meaning it will take ages to scroll back down to where you were before. I've never tried Daedalus, but it seems overpriced for a basic text editor.  Note also that the Fountain format itself doesn't highlight how many pages you've written (as it's just plain text), so you'll end up with either a malnourished or bloated screenplay if you don't consistently check up on it by pasting it into a third-party program. There's a lot of maintenance required, whereas a more dedicated app will allow you to simply write in the program without stopping.  I've never tried Fade In or Final Draft. I have heard bad things about the Final Draft app, but I can't verify those claims. I can't in good faith compare those programs to the other options without having used them directly. I may switch to Fade In on the basis of its cheap price and availability of a free version, but it has no user reviews at the moment so it's a bit of a risk. I'll give it a shot. Maybe I'll be the first user review?"

The cheap and easy way: you find some larger than life person and just strip away everything that is challenging or isn't palatable. Like Turing in ""The Imitation Game"" or any of the characters in TBBT, who were based on people like Sean Carroll. The hard way: you invent.     The Maturin character by Patrick O'Brian is a great example. At first glance, he's absurd and contradictory: he's a pacifistic and highly committed surgeon, who's a cold-blooded, highly lethal killer, who's a devote and idealistic irish catholic, who's a pragmatic and effective secret agent for the British navy, who's a hopeless, deluded romantic, who's a respected natural scientist, who's a depressive opium addict.    But on the page, O'Brian makes him come to life by internally dramatizing all the contradiction: he hates himself and he hates the world too, the only way he can sleep at night is huge doses of opium. He dislikes the British but he dislikes Napoleon more. At the same time he can't help but admire them both.  He has well-defined and rigid moral and ethical codes but he accepts that sometimes they're not expedient.  But when he betrays them he puts a lot of effort into punishing himself for the horrible things he's done. He's wracked with doubt and so sick of the world he's suicidal. But when he's on the job he's focused and professional. Sometimes it seem like his whole life is just a string of difficult tasks he can devote himself to so he'll have some reason to not O.D. He's a megalomaniac who needs the idea of a higher power so he can feel humility.  He's overly sensitive and often cowardly but he manages to push his humanity aside and let the ""reptilian brain""  take over. And then immediately regret it. He'll justify something to himself carefully and rationally and then turn around and attack his own reasoning and beliefs. There's just no clear answer to who he is. It's just a constant internal struggle."

They're looking first for your ability to tell an engaging story, but also for your willingness to take risks and a sense of your distinctive voice. They don't care about genre, formatting, or salability. Submitting samples from a few different scripts/stories rather than twenty-five from one script is probably a good idea, since you'll be able to show different sides of your writing and you never know what the admissions reader will respond to, but ultimately you should go with your gut and understand that, no matter what happens, the guy on the other end is just that: a person reading your material.

I think that's all of them? Oh also, Barbossa's pirates are skeleton monsters.  I feel like this article drastically overcomplicates the idea of ""initial conditions."" Basically all it's saying is that you need to set up your characters and stakes in Act 1, and make sure everything plays out organically. There should be no dumb luck for your protagonist, and you avoid that pitfall by going back and ""foreshadowing"" (so to speak) necessary plot points early on. [wrytagain's example is exactly what I mean by that]  To keep with Pirates: Will is able to barter with Barbossa because of information he/we learned gradually up to that point (but was layered in from the beginning); Elizabeth and Jack are able to convince Norrington to rescue Will by exploiting character traits established almost immediately; Jack and Will are able to team up and defeat Barbossa through their shared knowledge of information divulged in the first half of the movie.   This whole thing reminds me of one of those nifty Pixar tips that have been circulating here recently says something to the effect of ""coincidences that help your protag are bad; coincidences that hurt your protag are good.""

It took me for-fucking-ever to get through Act 1, because I know what the end is and I kept going back setting everything up.   When you see a film with all those pay-offs of stuff from the first half of the script, it wasn't all written in order. It's like I'll put this scene here (pg. 50) and I'll go back and show Hortense hates dogs in Act 1.

Make it organic, rather than a blatant set up.  I will always point people towards the Road Warrior when I think of set up because it does it so well between the dog, shotgun and bomb.

Screenwriting,3c4xgz,Asiriya,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:18:56 2015 UTC,"Terry Rossio provides excellent information on his site. While this article about setting up the initial conditions is helpful, I found Screenwriting Column 49 Situation-Based Writing the most helpful of all.   To recap:  First, you must create interest. That's the job description of screenwriter, right there.  Next, the best way to create interest is through situation.  Situations emerge from circumstances, or strong character need, or both.  It is possible to write an entire screenplay with only situation-based scenes.   I also find Michael Arndt's Michael Arndt - Beginnings: Setting A Story In Motion video an excellent way to set up the initial conditions of a story.   Introduce the main character and the world he lives in, showing him doing the thing the love most. This is their grand passion/defining trait/the center of their whole universe. Show the character’s flaw. The character’s flaw comes out of his grand passion. It’s a good thing that’s been taken too far. Then you want to establish storm clouds on the horizon. Your character's walking down the road of life on a nice sunny day and off on the horizon are some dark storm clouds.  Then BA-BOOM. Something comes in and blows apart your hero's life and turns it upside down. Their grand passion gets taken away from them! It totally changes what the hero's future is going to be AND you have to add insult to injury. You have to add something that makes the whole world seem unfair.  The main character's life has changed, their grand passion taken away, the world has revealed itself to be unfair and he comes to a fork in the road. He comes to a fork in the road and has to make a choice on how to deal with his new reality. There's a high road to take, a healthy responsible choice, or a low road to take, and an unhealthy, irresponsible choice. And they take the unhealthy choice. The key is to make the audience root for the hero to make the unhealthy, irresponsible choice, because we feel his pain. This creates/provokes  a crisis, creating a goal for the rest of the story and off into the second act. Your story is coming out of your character's deepest desires and their darkest fears. The thing they love gets taken away from them and the world is revealed to be unfair. To put things right, they have to make the journey which is the rest of the film. By the end of the journey, hopefully they not only get back what they lost, but they'll be forced to fix that little flaw they had when we first met them."

Read through the list, you'll notice even ""unlikeable"" guys like Walter White, Jordon Belfort and Tony Montana hit about 7-8 out of 9.  All of this is by Eric Edson, from ""The Story Solution"":   COURAGE. Not optional. Your lead has got to have guts. We identify more readily with flawed people, yes, but those flaws cannot include a lack of courage because only brave people take action, and only action can drive a story forward. UNFAIR INJURY. After courage, the second quickest way to bond a reader to your heroine is to place her at the outset in a situation where blatant injustice is being inflicted upon her. Few things stir our passions like injustice. Unfair Injury also demands that the heroine DO something in response – an excellent place to start any story. SKILL. We admire people who possess the grace, expertise, and mental acumen required to become masters of their chosen work. Doesn’t matter what your hero’s field of endeavor might be – tinker, tailor, CEO – as long as he’s expert at it. FUNNY. We warm to people who make us smile. We’re naturally drawn to folks with a humorous view of the passing parade. So if you can possibly bestow upon your hero a robust and playful sense of humor, do it. JUST PLAIN NICE. We can easily care about kind, decent, helpful, honest people, and we admire those who treat others well, relate with respect to people in humble walks of life, and who defend the weak or stand up for the helpless.  IN DANGER. If when we first meet the heroine she’s already in a situation of real danger, it grabs our attention immediately. Danger means the imminent threat of personal harm or loss. What represents danger in any particular story depends on the scope of your tale. In fantasy, horror, and sci-fi it’s almost always the life or death kind. LOVED BY FRIENDS AND FAMILY. If we’re shown right off that the hero is already loved by other people, it gives us immediate permission to care about him, too. How many movies have you seen that begin with a surprise party thrown for the hero by a room full of adoring friends, or some other get-together taking place where affection gushes from a doting mom, dad, sibling, mate, child, or best friend? HARD WORKING. The heroines and heroes we care about have an enormous capacity for work. People who work hard create the energy needed to drive a story forward. OBSESSED. Obsession keeps brave, skilled, hard-working heroes focused on a goal, which is enormously important for any story. Driving obsession creates an active plot."

Walter White was not a nice guy.  Tony Soprano was not a nice guy.  They weren't ""likeable"".  They were interesting.  The way you make someone interesting is to give them two traits which contradict each other.  He's a school teacher and a meth cooker.  He's a family man and a ruthless killer.  He's a tough guy and has panic attacks.  And then give them a problem to which the audience can relate.  He has cancer.  His mom is a crazy bitch who is ruining his life.

He is a massive dick and while I find it funny, wouldn't be surprised if other people found him morally-isolating and deeply unlikeable. But I'm willing to give benefit of the doubt.  BAD: I'm 20 pages in and we've already gone through ACT 1 and ACT 2. That's fine if there's some plot to drive the narrative forward, but there's nothing. It's 100% set-up. I have no idea what the show is about, what the story engine will be. At the moment it's just an amusing dick bouncing from classroom to classroom being a dick.

Every show has a story engine. It's the mechanism that supplies you with material for an episode. So for cop procedurals, the story engine is that cases enter the precinct and must be investigated. In medical procedurals it's that sick people arrive into the hospital and must be treated. These are popular genres because you don't have to do anything to activate the story engine - cops aren't roaming the streets looking for murders to investigate. The murders come to them.  The Big Bang Theory's story engine is that there's a group of extremely intelligent people who have deficient social skills. This disconnect generates a multitude of situations they must extricate themselves from. Every episode starts from this point.  While a series may shift in tone over the years, the story engine remains the same. What you're being asked to prove is that the story engine is sound enough to supply a season's worth of stories."

Show the dynamics of that family. Most spec pilots get this note: cut all this plot into the first act, explore the situation in the second, third, fourth act – odds are the pilot will be your only time the characters exist, don’t save anything. Pilots usually work like this: ordinary world (setup character dynamics)/ break from expectations (explore the dynamics via chaos that follows) /new status quo (sets up dynamic that the rest of the season will explore). Avoid premise pilots. A pilot should feel like an illustrative episode of the series, not a completely separate story that fails to set up what you find interesting about the concept and cast."

Bully one is cocky, an alpha male, secretly gay.  Bully two is brooding, poetic, and has an old dog.  Ep one: set up the character traits. Show that the bullies want to be mobsters. Set up boss and rival. Shit happens. End ep two.  Ep two: they get one step closer to being real mobster. Meanwhile, B gets involved with a poetry slam chick.  Ep three: enjoying new status quo as half ass mobsters. Meanwhile, A almost gets caught out in a gay club.  Ep four: things get more serious in mob land. Old dog dies.

This guy knows nothing about story structure, he's basically a mouthpiece for less articulate people who get kicks out of 'beating' a film's nexus of logic. What he/they don't seem to get at all is emotional logic - why is he focusing on lack of fleshed out characters when that doesn't even apply to this film's concept and would derail the effectiveness of the film? Practically all his points revolve around tearing down aspects of the film that aren't relevant to what it's trying to achieve in terms of story (an already dick thing to do, but whatever). And his disclaimers about people defending Inside Out based on the fact that it's for children: it's not that Inside Out is immune from criticism, it's that films intended for children need to be simpler and don't intend to subvert audience expectations at every turn. I'd argue this is why Pixar's films are successful amongst older audiences - they have a clear narrative that focuses on its themes, making their films coherent and impactful. Ugh."

Try to grab your own footage of those wile you're actually shooting. Worst case scenario, you'll already have something, and it'll help you make the narrative more concrete in your brain.

Screenwriting,3c2mhc,poseymund,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:30:55 2015 UTC,"Film Editor here.  I've cut both fiction and docs.  I'd be cautious trying to take a standard screenwriting approach like this and trying to make it work on a documentary.  The best documentarians in my experience are hugely material-driven.  That is, they research deeply (and by this I mean out there in the real world meeting people, hanging out with them, experiencing the situation) and they then follow where the truth takes them.  The skill is a) allowing yourself to be led by the material, b) winning the trust of those whose life this is, and c) finding a way to represent the revealed truth onscreen.  None of those things are as easy as they sound.  The documentary form is a lot more fluid than fictional forms like studio features or TV dramas, there are a wider set of storytelling techniques available to you (see last year's The Possibilities Are Endless as an example).  As a result, if you are material-led, it's almost impossible to correctly predict what form you final film will be.  This gives rise to the pre-eminence of the editing stage in docs.  Once you step away from formatted TV, the edit is where documentaries are lost and found, and where a lot of the 'writing' as you might think of it is done.  I know that's kind of general, and maybe not so useful.  If I were you I'd seriously consider finding a mentor of some kind to help you in these early stages.  Also try shooting some little unrelated five-minute docs over the next few months, make some mistakes, figure out some things.  And it's never too early to start building those relationships with possible contributors.  Good luck!"

I think Julie was a little all over the place because she seemed too bubbly in some places and then was cursing in other parts. For example, I wasn't buying when she was saying interwebz and stuff. Maybe kids talk like this and I'm not the target audience. I didn't really by the part where Julie asked if he liked her. It seems like they've been friends for a long time and there's a sort of mutual agreement between the to that there's nothing romantic between them. They have nothing in common anyway it seems.

I think the biggest take-away I've had from this is: If it's no good, no one will care.

I think I see what you're trying to do [obv, correct me if I'm wrong] in that you're trying to show the audience who your characters are, what their philosophies on death are because of their brother dying, and establishing what the dynamics are between the 3 brothers.  the problem is that it all seems for the audience's benefit instead of easing us into who they are.  I would think that it would be better to show us who they are and save some of the bigger blocks of dialogue as we get into the script.  Like, if their big discussion was the catalyst for the motivation of the central plot that'd be much better, in my amateur opinion.  this is minor, but format wise, you have a few times where there is a dialogue block interrupted with ""PAUSE""...  such as;  Hello? PAUSE I dunno. I didn’t wanna stick around. I needed some air. PAUSE I didn’t think you cared. You were in the middle of a conversation and I didn’t want to interrupt you. Whetever, dude.   it's one of those things that just destroy the flow of the text.  you need to find a better way to do that if you're going to include directions like that.  that said, unless there's a thematic reason for the pause, I tend to not include stuff like that because you've got to leave it up to the actor to bring life to the dialogue.  when I do include stuff like that, my thought is that there needs to be an external [showable] factor for his pause.  Maybe I'd write it like this.  ALEX Hello?  Alex stares at Oscar as he waits for a response that doesn't come.  ALEX (con't) I dunno. I didn’t wanna stick around. I needed some air.  Oscar gives Alex a look that silently says that he's being ridiculous.  ALEX (con't) I didn’t think you cared. You were in the middle of a conversation and I didn’t want to interrupt you.

Even better, go for a run and get your heart rate going and your endorphins up.  Do you have someone you can talk to, to bounce ideas off of and talk through issues?    I go through bouts of depression where writing seems to be this amorphous thing that is constantly out of my grasp. And these are the things that usually helps me out temporarily to get productive.  Exercising is known to help depression, and you'd be surprised at how well getting up and working out your body does in getting rid of that fog from your brain. Even if it's just a short brisk walk. Also getting out and having direct contact with the sun is something that helps depression too. So my best advice is to get outside and go for a walk or run.   My second advice is to talk to someone. It doesn't need to be about personal issues, because I know how difficult that is, but just opening up to someone about your writing issues and trying to tackle your writing problems together is a big help. At least in my experience. This requires someone you're close to and have trust in their writing advice though.  Of course, these are all temporary things that can help you out right now. Some tips to get you through this hard time now.   Depression is something that sucks at your soul and will continuously bring you down. It's a constant struggle, and I would suggest getting professional help if you can and are willing. Which, I don't know what you mean by taking your meds, but you could already be doing.   Good luck! Writing is tough enough without depression clouding your mind. If you try all my advice out and feel it still isn't working, feel free to PM me, and I'll be happy to see what else has helped me in my experience, that you could try out."
Screenwriting,3bxo7m,Run_Turtle_Run,3,Fri Jul 3 01:16:34 2015 UTC,"In addition to the walk/run, I think it's worth mentioning that it sometimes helps me to write in a place that's completely out of the ordinary. A park or coffee shop are common places, but try something like deep into a hiking trail, or in your car at night- something crazy. It seems counter intuitive, but (for me) the less used to the setting I am, the easier it is to focus on my writing; maybe it has something to do with seeing my laptop in such a strange location.  It's not groundbreaking advice, I know, but hopefully it's helpful to someone."

Honestly, even just talking here on Reddit is a bit difficult. It's a little easier, since it's not solving, it's just thinking. If that makes any sense.   Right now since it's revision, I just need to get through it... there isn't really a specific problem I can't solve. I just can't get through reading half a page, without forcing myself to focus on each line at a time. Because of this, I can't feel the rhythm or get a sense of what came before and where it's leading. I don't even know what's funny and what isn't right now. And the things I find marginally funny are too dark to get past censors.   But I got through act one tonight (it was like pushing a crate through mud, but I got through it, one beat at a time).

I've been around the same people talking about the same things over and over again. I have a set pace and a rough timeframe in which to write. Little things annoy me out of the blue, like remembering someone walks by at the same time every day and I just anticipated it, breaking my concentration. Like you, worry or even thought about when it should be done has been an issue, and I'm sure you can agree even a mild depression prevents anything useful from happening.  My solution was to always ingest new things. And I mean across the board. Eat something different. Go out in nature by yourself or with someone you haven't seen in a while. Read about things you love. Read about things you're curious about. Revisit a film you love.  The root of Writer's Block, whether it's actually a thing or not, is completely your mindset. Think of it like a skipping record: the same neurons are firing over and over. They're stuck. You've got to pick up that needle and manually move it. Or just bang the side of the record player.

You are obviously extremely talented if you are the primary writer on a TV show. There's just no way you could slip through all the gatekeepers to progress as far as you have without that being true. At the moment, you don't trust your own opinion. Fine. Trust the opinion of others. It's basically impossible that they can ALL be wrong.  Even then, you might be at the stage where you're thinking ""shit, I've lost my gift"". And if you're in the middle of a bout of depression, it's very easy to think that. But fall back on the fact that you have done this time and time again. At the moment, just dare to be adequate. I would bet that, with your experience, your adequate will be better than most people's great. And that it will actually turn out to be better than your adequate.  Writing can be punishing on the mind. It's solitary. It forces you into deep, repetitive thinking. It involves the pressure of deadlines. It can seem like fluff and nonsense and make you start questioning your entire existence and purpose...  ... but just think back to a time when you've handed something in and felt good about it.

Until you've been through it, it's almost impossible to understand exactly how bad it is, and exactly what it feels like. Or even believe that it exists at all. I didn't. Until I went through it. From what you've described, I am pretty sure that you're there.  But here's why I'm saying you can do it. You managed to drag yourself to your computer and say how you were feeling. And, more importantly, you managed to get through a day's work. I'm sure it felt like having to eat bowl after bowl of Dickensian gruel, but you did it. Which means that, while depressed, you're still functional enough to grind on. That's not without risks of making things worse, but in the weigh-up between the further  (unjustified) recrimination you'd feel for not pushing on versus just setting it aside for now, the (again unjustified) punishment you'd put yourself through if you did let it slide would have its own dangers and exacerbating effects.  A MAJOR CAVEAT: I'm obviously not your doctor, though (or a doctor at all). And I'm not you. So make sure you put your health first, listen to medical professionals and do whatever's necessary to protect yourself. If that means letting it go, then that's what it means. If it comes to that, no matter what the depression tells you, it will NOT be your fault. It'd be like blaming yourself for not being able to rock climb with a broken leg.

Screenwriting,3bxo7m,Blackfedorah,3,Fri Jul 3 14:20:28 2015 UTC,"You have my sympathies. I wish I had concrete advice about depression.   I would say that if you can get an emergency meeting with your therapist, that might help.   The other thing is, putting my producer hat on, is simply: you say you're the primary writer, so I'm assuming you don't have a writing boss. But it also means you have a writing underling.   I would seriously consider bringing them in, if feasible. I mean, imagine you were in a car crash and broke your wrist and were unable to write for a week. You would pick up the phone and call the most senior available writer on your staff and say, ""I'm in trouble, but we need these pages for the network, can you help?""  Even if it's about co-writing these pages, having them come in and working together on it - that's part of what a staff is for, right? To bail each other out when any given writer can't bring their best fastball.   Because mental illness is often so stigmatized, it's harder to do that. But you've been diagnosed, you're on your meds, you're doing everything right. And you wouldn't think twice about bringing in help if your ailment was physical.   Imagining that I was the show's producer (which obviously I'm not, and maybe there are political issues here I'm unaware of) obviously my first choice is to have my #1 guy - that's you, for a reason! - delivering the pages.   But my #2 choice is whatever the hell it takes to get decent pages. Because my bottom choice, the worst possible result, is not getting the pages. At the very least, you should bring that producer into the discussion if you feel you can (sometimes you might not want to let them know about your condition, etc), because then they can help you chart the best course - because the other thing is that if the pages are going to be late, or need extra work, or whatever, and the producer knows that NOW, they can prepare for it and minimize the damage.   Whereas if the network is expecting the pages as 9 AM on Monday at the first the producer hears about it is 2:30 AM Sunday Night, there's nothing he can do about it.   There may be political or practical reasons why this isn't tenable, I get it. But if it is tenable, you should seriously consider it. The show must go on."

Many of the comments here about taking a shower or doing something else is similar to my first suggestion. Preferably on a sunny day, look up at the sky and smile. When you do this your body may naturally try and change physiology back to your depressive state. Before you let it do this try and capture what thoughts are coming to you.   Depression has a purpose. Typically when you have beliefs or values that conflict this can cause a state of mind where you stop creating possible next actions. This happens a lot to people growing older. They have deep rooted beliefs they don't question and as life happens and their body starts to feel older it challenges key beliefs in a person. That is only one example.   Now, let me touch on something. There is a belief that depression is a physical thing you can't control and the only way to deal with it is drugs. The truth is depression is physical. Can you control it? Of course  you can. Again, depression has a purpose. The mind is a fragile thing. The fact that we function at all with the looming idea we will one day expire is a testament to the protective functions of our psyche. Drugs can help you get to a state to begin handling these issues.   You're about to go on your own hero's journey. Try identifying what is causing you shut down. If you believe you are not in control then there is nothing that can help you. Belief is necessary and if you don't believe you can then you need to get help to open up possibilities.

I'm not much by way of a writer now, but dealing with depression through university helped me find ways to cope with deadlines.  I found personally it helped to chunk my work into smaller goals and challenges so I could prioritize and segment my time.  What I would do is grab a timer and set it for half an hour or so, knowing that I would get a break after the timer went off.  Instead of looking at getting the entire project/paper done, I was focusing on what I thought I could get done in that half hour.  The thought of taking on an entire paper or assignment was often too daunting to focus on, but the thought of writing an introductory paragraph was much easier to focus on.  I found that productivity snowballed into more productivity as I managed my work in small, bite-sized pieces.  Just know that as you deal with this, you're building strategies and coping mechanisms for when it comes up in the future.  What you're going through right now isn't in vain."

Even if you have to go out and search what they mean when the common joke ""I thought I was Dale"" is repeated in multiple episodes.    3: The show is a low budget blast and showcases all kinds of fantastic creative skits, characters, and dialogue.

My point is more some episodes where he rants about film critics and how they know nothing about movies and how they all got into the business to spew negativity. That may be true in some cases, but from what I can tell, most critics started writing film criticism because they loved movies, and wanted to write about why they love them.    How often does he launch a jeremiad against agents?   There have been a few episodes where he talks about the joy in firing someone. That just bugs me. The only time when firing someone is something you should be happy about is when they're blatantly doing things to hurt your career. Sure, sometimes things aren't working out and they aren't as effective as they could be, so it's time for them to go, but that doesn't seem like something to derive pleasure from.

Show me the white house blowing up, followed by a press conference with a completely disheveled man in what was a perfectly tailored suit, I know he is the President and I know everything just hit the fan. This one has an establishing shot, the white house blowing up.  Show me the boxer taking the last punch of the fight, I know what happened before that. No establishing shot, all the information we need is in the frame.  Straight into the deep end, then crawl back out. If I need background on a character to understand that it just hit the fan, then just enough of it. Same with establishing shots, if I need to know this takes place in SF then a stock footage helicopter of the Golden Gate says it.

While you ponder that, let's review. I said:   Also, I don't think they are done much anymore in screenplays, anyway. It's a director decision kinda thing.   In your example, the script was written by the directors. It's not a spec script or an assignment for a producer with a director to be named later.  The Coen bros tend to write what they are going to shoot.  And so, establishing shots they want as the director's decision are included. The script we see is a shooting script.  In my example, the twenty-something  writer's script we can read online is not a shooting script. Written on assignment but owned by the writer, it eschews establishing shots.  You might notice in the film, the director goes to the outside of Turing's house in the rain (establishing) and then to the INT. which is where Moore opened. Not in the script. Director's choice.   I have no ""take"" on any of this except to say - what I already said. It wasn't a pronouncement, wasn't unilateral, wasn't a directive.   Happy 4th of July."

The times I've seen it used in a script, it normally wasn't followed by an action line -- just another slugline.

Screenwriting,3bxfa9,HotspurJr,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:01:45 2015 UTC,"An opening image is a specific image chosen to open the movie with, usually with some sort of thematic resonance. It's often useful to think about, but plenty of scripts don't have a carefully constructed one.   That classic case of an establishing shot is, say, showing the outside of the diner in ""Seinfeld"" before they cut into it. Movies use these, too, although they've honestly become somewhat dated in both media. More modern shows are more likely to just trust that, ""hey, we've been in this location in half our episodes, you know where it is"" but it is still a perfectly valid stylistic choice.   You don't need them, and even if a film/show will end up having them, you don't always need to write them. Honestly, how to get in and out of scenes in interesting ways is one of those things directors spend a lot of time thinking about. ""Establishing shot of exterior. Cut to master interior"" is about the most boring possible way to do it. Sometimes it's serving a purpose, but for the most part, unless there's some strong specific reason to use them, there's no harm in ignoring them.   I generally default to never writing them barring that strong specific reason."

Screenwriting,3bztys,Asiriya,8,Fri Jul 3 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"I can't tell you how many times I've had discussions with writers on the internet who started a project ""for the exercise"" only to finish it and rail against how unfair the universe is that they can't try to sell it.  Whenever I hear somebody say they're going to do something they can't sell as a concept, I start a ticking mental clock in my head. I know that in three or six months what they're going to be saying.   I also don't think those things (highlighting major arcs, streaming, etc) are things you're not practicing while writing original material. And forget learning to write in someone else's voice - you've got to learn to write in your own, first. Developing your own voice is far more important.   Part of the problem with the exercise, too, is that the preexisting material is doing a lot of the heavy lifting for you. A lot of the work on plot mechanics, characterization, concept development, etc is already done.   The art of constructing a plot invariably includes coming up with a variety of scenes which get cut (even if they exist only briefly in your mental outline), so you do that sort of streamlining work anyway.   If you can legally control a valuable property, and you're in a position to exploit that before your rights go away, maybe. There are commercial advantages to having pre-existing material.

It's the difference between creating a statue out of rock and creating a statue out of legos.  If you're only using premade pieces, you're never going to learn how to create those things out of whole cloth.  Learning to write with someone else's voice is an interesting skill set, but in features, you're not necessarily trying to write in the voice of the author, you're trying to write in the voice of the director.  What s/he finds interesting about the piece may be different than what you do, and taking their direction is more important than carrying out your idea of what the author's idea was.  Plus, you can't sell your adaptation.  No one will look at it.  Even as a sample.  So it's not only less efficient learning wise, it's also guaranteeing that you won't be able to sell it or use it to help you get another job."

I've also seen a writer I know create the underlying IP in order to pitch it. He did a bunch of research, wrote an article, got it published, and used it to base his pitch on. He felt this was more favorable than just pitching the (not super-commercial) idea to begin with, and since I think he sold the pitch, I suspect he was right."

It's coherent. A lot of scripts by amateur writers aren't. Your script seems ...I don't want to say well structured but it has structure. I wasn't confused by anything you wrote.   Your voice ...well you have one, which is a big deal. Your style has a lot of energy, and that energy matches the tone of your writing.   Now the bad...I've seen this movie. We all have. A teen coming of age story, of four friends. You have the sports one, the smart one, the blah blah. Even just reading your logline made me a little bored. I read 10 pages to be sure, but it was pretty boring the whole time. I started skipping reading at about page 7.   Really only one thing made me smile, the faculty parking lot being shitty cars, and the student one being nice cars. But, this is a comedy. You probably need to make me laugh out loud by page 10.  Nothing about it really felt fresh or honest. All your characters felt like parodies. It did not feel modern either, I did not believe these kids were born in 1997, it felt like they were born in teen movies from the 2000s.   I think the issue at it's core comes down to the weak premise. I think this will need some serious rewriting. My advice would be - work out what you're trying to say in this movie. The central dramatic intent as Craig Mazin would call it.  Find a way to make the set up of your story funny. Find a way to surprise us. Play with expectations and conventions, flip things around. Work out who your audiences is. Is it teenagers laughing along with the characters? Or is it adults laughing at teenagers?   And most importantly, work out why you need us to see this story. What is unique and creative about it that only you can tell the world?  I hope you found my criticism helpful, and if you want to ask any questions please feel free."

It felt like you were trying to hard and I found it hard to concentrate on what I was supposed to be seeing. I think a little goes a long way with a style like yours. I'd dial it back a lot. And save your little quips for punchlines. Of course that's highly subjective. Someone else might love your style I dunno.  You might want to rethink your opening page. Because we start outside the school, then go inside, then go outside again? It seems odd and doesn't fill me with confidence about your storytelling ability. And all for the purpose of establishing a school on the last day of class. That could be accomplished in a few lines vs 1 page.  Your characters seemed like stock generic high school comedy characters.  I'm not really sure what Noam was supposed to be. Is he supposed to be smart? What he's arguing makes no sense. It's like saying he doesn't believe in gravity. Ok, so maybe he's a dumb weirdo then? I don't really know. If he's supposed to be smart, give him an interesting argument to make. Saying he doesn't believe in Newton's First law and leaving at that is just not working.  Then you've got dudes just speaking high school dude speak. There's nothing new or fresh about any of it. And I don't really care at page 5 what happens to these guys. Maybe they have  a wild fun unique adventure (I doubt it though) but you've already lost me.  High school comedies have been done a million times. You really have to take a step and look at what you've got. Is it something new and exciting that people want to read? Or did you just do an okay version of every other high school comedy ever made?  Take a look at Superbad. Seth and Evan's conversation in the beginning is funny, different and gives insight into their characters. Does your conversation b/w Carroll and Sandy accomplish the same things? Not really.

Second, contests. The Black List. These aren't a panacea but definitely worth exploring.   Third, networking. Meet people. Make friends. Start with other writers.  If people like you, and think you're smart and interesting, they'll ask to read your stuff.   If you are a relatively inexperienced screenwriter - and I'm guessing you are - then the reality is that your pilot is probably not that good.  You should expect it to take a decade before you're producing professional quality work. Take that dream of sending off an email, and in a month you've got a pilot sold, three months later its being shot, and put it on the shelf. That does happen, sometimes ... but most of the time it doesn't. Most of the time, the road is much longer than that.

Screenwriting,3bwn2y,HotspurJr,2,Tue Jul 7 15:01:02 2015 UTC,"as someone who does sitcom lighting at CBS radford (think TVLand),  Its very incestual.   yes, there are alot of writers, (prolly to any above the line people for such shit content), but its very much a club.   they move from one terrible project to another, in big groups of circle jerking and patting each other on the back.  Its actually pretty amusing, because they really convince themselves only they can do it, and really buy into it.  And that leaves an outsider,  on the outside.  they dont  want someone thats not in their club to prove it can be done easily.  So they keep coming up with terrible 3 camera ideas that steal the premise of every Honeymooners episode ever, and rearange characters and locations.  They keep a tight grip on everything, especially who gets in their club.  Wouldnt want to miss a payment on the leases benz or the Taluca Lake house.  The way it usually works is to hire from within.  they move their people up.   Every once in awhile someone can bust in, but typically now.  I work on so many Sitcom Pilots that go nowhere.  We even shoot half seasons, and it still goes nowhere.  So follow everyones advice and keep writing.  If you can, start as a PA or Intern, and work your way up.  You will be able to work your way up that club of Sitcom in a couple years.  Now I dont know,  but I kind of feel like Real TV and Movie people dont take Sitcom writers seriously.  I mean, really, its shit for the Honey Boo Boo crowd.  So transfering to Episodic may be like starting all over again.    Just an insiders feeling on it.   If you really want to do Sitcoms, and nothing else,  go for it.  Its very easy once you are in.  Its just a tough shell to crack.  An indie movie or Episodic pilot might fair better at getting you some attention.  my 2cents"
Screenwriting,3bwn2y,HotspurJr,2,Sat Jul 4 05:08:11 2015 UTC,"The way it usually works is to hire from within.    Actually, there is a contractual position (""staff writer"") that HAS to go to a first-timer. Also, network shows in their second season have to hire a freelancer for an episode (most usually use their writing assistant, but again, that's somebody who hasn't been on staff).  That is, in fact, one of the big advantages of working in TV. They literally HAVE to hire outsiders. There's a career path of a sort.   And even with pilots - a friend of mine sold a half-hour to ABC Studios last year and I believe ABC Family is producing it now. It happens - although that show isn't a traditional three-camera sitcom.    but I kind of feel like Real TV and Movie people dont take Sitcom writers seriously.   This, on the other hand, I agree with completely. Certainly movie people do - but the joke has always been the feature writers get the glory, while tv writers get the money."

Lately I've been seeing ads for such utter shit and I'm like these guys get greenlit before someone like me?   The truth is I never wanted to even go into TV.  I prefer doing movies. This idea came straight from the heart and TV felt the best way to portray this story.  It won't work as a movie or miniseries.  It has an actual arc but we'll see what happens i guess.  For now I'll focus on my youtube channel (mostly comedy sketches) and see what happens from there.    I was thinking if no managers or agents or production companies reply by the end of the summer, just submit it to amazon and see what happens.   I originally wanted to be the showrunner and an actor in the show but if Amazon decides to pick it up, they get to make all the decisions for a shit income.    Also I appreciate everyone's feedback."

There's something to be said for having proven you can do something that most people can't do.   But honestly, a) don't judge material by the ads. b) ask yourself if you're being objective about your own work.    I originally wanted to be the showrunner and an actor in the show but if Amazon decides to pick it up, they get to make all the decisions for a shit income.   If you create a show that a major network wants, you will be partnered with an experienced show runner. The business of running a show is complicated and hard, and you don't know what you don't know. There's no way they're going to trust that precious of a commodity (airtime) to somebody with zero track record.   And this goes double if you want to act. Basically, you need a track record of some sort of success.  e.g. Lena Dunham had written, directed, and starred in a highly acclaimed indie movie. If you just show up and say, ""And I want to be a star"" they're smile and nod while saying, ""Next!""  Something like Crazy-Ex Girlfriend is something Rachel Bloom was able to co-create and star in because she was having success as a comedian.   So if you want to go that path, you need to find a way to establish yourself first, even if its in another medium. I mean, you'll still be partnered withs someone more experienced (both of those actors are) and the network will still be making a lot of decisions (because that's what they do, unless you have a huge track record of success).   But I mean this in the nicest possible way, but it really does seem to me like you think that this is as easy as sending off a couple of emails and then having people drive a dump truck full of cash up to your house. I suspect you haven't been at this very long. Trust me: it's not that easy.  That being said:   Sounds like you are doing one thing absolutely right: the youtube channel. Keep that up. Develop your voice. Find an audience. If you start finding a large audience on youtube, agents will find you. Producers will find you. Good luck!"

Sometimes an Actor will be so good, and so experience, they will try their hand at Directing.  But people dont just do both. Acting is totally about Vanity imo.     So you should keep doing youtube, but really sort out what you want.   Nothing I hated more, then working on some Indie movie for an Actor/Writer/Director.   Those always went nowhere.  Also, Amazon is a great idea.  Im lighting on an Amazon show right now, and the contracts paying $1 under last years scale(means it pays well, they have money).

I think it was the latter."

Screenwriting,3bt65t,DickHero,12,Thu Jul 2 07:45:28 2015 UTC,"This is interesting...there are quite a few adults who don't understand ""how ideas register with other human beings"".   Also musical prodigies such as Beethoven and Mozart were taught many many hours each day by brutal parents. Beethoven's dad would come home drunk after bars closed, to wake his son for practice at three in the morning. Visitors reported seeing young Beethoven sobbing while standing at the piano.     It is difficult to imagine a routine which such parents could inflict upon children to teach creative writing. Typing skills, rigorous reading, broad formal education...frankly our elite schools are FILLED with such students and they are boring as fuck. The quote ""don't write like you went to school"" comes to mind.   Anyhow, super fascinating key subject: how to write ""cool"", how to write cool characters...how to even write alpha characters when one is not an alpha or beta but somewhere out near zed...  A comedian friend and I had an interesting conversation recently...there are successful good comics who can deliver a line but just aren't cool, like, you would never say to a first date ""would you like to go see Comic B?"" Because even though Comic B would make a great character actor or supporting actress, and can deliver original world-class perfect jokes, they're just so lame, such a pathetic goofball that asking a date to go see such a comic would make you look lame too :) I hope you know what I mean...there are probably more clear terms for such phenomena within comedy.   How to teach personality - chill, cool, brave, fun - is very very hard. Not straightforward IQ or a factor people are ""born with"" - people do change, they can definitely become cool, but how? And how can whatever it is in their environment that transforms a lame person into a cool personbe distilled into something teachable?"

I'm faced with the same issues when I'm trying to write alphas. That isn't me, thankfully, and I have never had to be around them so I don't really know how they behave so I can't even do observational stuff . And I think there's a real lack of produced content with characters that are alpha and feel real, they're usually aggressive caricatures.   But I think the amount of stuff produced on youtube and instagram etc should allow study, if necessary. Or embed yourself in a football team on tour or something.  I was watching George Clooney on a chat show talking about the things he gets up to, stupid pranks he pulls like pretending to send messages and presents as Brad Pitt. I couldn't get away with that, people would think it's weird. So what about George means that he can? Appearance, reputation, sure. But I think there's some ability to gauge response that I know I lack, I'm always misjudging things. And timing.

Screenwriting,3bt65t,Dofleini,2,Wed Jul 1 23:14:02 2015 UTC,"I've never been a child actor, but I've seen a number work. Some are just marvellously empathetic. They get it. Emotion is the universal language, and they just tap into it. These guys are special and rare.   Some are good at emotional recall. They've been trained how to tap into specific emotions by their schools, so they can recall it as easily as we can write (they look sad).  Some are good at calibration. They read the room and roughly know what to offer up. See Clever Hans.  Some are just faking it. Watch low budget TV shows or bad 80's movies for some really bad child acting. Modern child actors are much better trained for some reason.  Also note, they're usually playing kids, not adults in a fantasy story (kids that can  play roles like that are creepy good). They only need a childlike understanding of the situation, and they behave honestly from their - happy, sad, empathetic, sarcastic.

Screenwriting,3buqik,CutShortOnReddit,2,Thu Jul 2 08:49:26 2015 UTC,"Scanning for life  Hey, I read it.  Thanks for sharing.  I think it’s a good start.  The writing (the actual wording) I think could use some work, but I was getting into the story for sure  The characters, to me, feel a bit typical, if that makes sense.  The loner leader, the youthful, naturally gifted, and rebellious protégé, along with the gruff though gentle, and aptly named giant;  but hey, if the story is there, what the hell right?  On Riley, I did not get that she, was a she, until the parenthetical a couple of lines down, but that was probably my fault.  When you wrote, in the description, “her GRAVITY CYCLE” I thought you were referring to Lucy’s gravity cycle for some reason, but looking back at it now I suppose it is clear.  However, that said, I would recommend you give her a more detailed description that clearly describes her as a female  On the universe, well, that is limitless;  and that’s the fun part  Obviously, as you brought it up, you are going to need to show what happened that caused there to be “so few of us left” - and touch on why conflict exists between survivors  Perhaps, since you refer to the ship from earth as being a “confederate” – maybe during the American Civil War, an alien race showed up and brought peace and technology;  and then - of course - we took it and made war with it because that is what we humans (humane/s) do  This angle could maybe set up the guilt and remorse your protagonist must come to terms with.  The musical record, it could be an heirloom.  Perchance Alistar’s forbearers offered a copy of that same record to the aliens back in the Civil War days.  (if they had records back then, if not, maybe they gave a performance, and the sheet music, which is just math anyway, the universal language.  Or hell, this is fiction, maybe the aliens have an affinity for vinyl and made the record from the performance.)  But then, confederates betray the Cain family, and blame them for the resulting misuse of the tech, so the high council banishes the Cain clan from earth  Maybe then, Alistar could team up with the original aliens to conquer earth.  I say conquer, as it will most certainly need to be taken from the confederates by force.  And I say it will need to, because peaceful means don’t generally play well on the sci-fi screen  (or many other screens it seems)  Maybe...  I don’t know...  But maybe  Maybe too, since you presently have some bodies floating out there, we could learn that these particular “confederates” - were actually “rebels” trying to deliver a message, but the mission was considered suicide – a calculated risk – a self-sacrifice – and the only way to get Aristar’s attention.  What is that message?  It is a distress call from an oppressed faction of humans attempting to succeed from an overbearing confederate government (a little history-repeating theme?) – and they need his help    This launches the reluctant/unavoidable voyage that Alistar must endure in order to achieve his character arc.  And this is the justification for the violence to come;  a plight that a human audience can relate to without losing affection for your characters  Or maybe – I’m way off base, but that is what came to me so I thought I would share it with you  Thanks for the read.  Please feel free to send me your expanded version if you wish;  and even if, or better, especially if, you don’t use any of my ideas.

Kurtz has a huge amount of exposition before we meet him (at least Redux). The audience has built up their expectations, and you can play on that.   The TRex in Jurassic Park comes in half way through. The first glimpse of the raptors even later. Again, lots of build up. But I don't know if that's what you mean? In these cases they are introduced early and there is character work before we see them in others' fear.  Do you mean an important character comes in unannounced? I think that it's down to the strength of the introduction. The beginning of Inglorious Bastards could have occurred at the end of a different film and still have been an incredible scene. As long as you can characterise sufficiently in the time you have, I don't see it as an automatic problem, but you will have to be careful of it feeling like a plot device. Foreshadowing is there to avoid things feeling undeserved, you'll just have to be skillful in your depictions.

Screenwriting,3br4i1,pomegranate2012,5,Wed Jul 1 13:59:14 2015 UTC,"A couple of thoughts -   Set it up. If she's busy and ambitious, it would be well within her character to be an excellent debater. If early on she brags that she's never lost an argument, you've created a moral crisis for her relative to this guy. Does she go back and try to win to keep her streak alive? If not, she's a quitter. She's ambitious, so she couldn't live with herself if she didn't try. Maybe she left because it looked like she'd lose, then considers herself a coward so goes back to ""take it like a woman."" Rocky theme playing, her on the web or at the library studying to try and come up with a way to beat him, etc.    Along similar lines, maybe she has to choose between an important business meeting/major life event or going back to argue with this bar manager. The joke is in how he gets under her skin to the point where she blows off something truly important just to try and win this argument. ""I'm sorry, I know it's my wedding day but there's no way I can let this guy think he's right! Just stall everyone for a couple of hours, I'll be back!!""     Create a bridge scene where she's given justification to go back. Maybe she talks with another character who gives her some terrible argument or advice that makes her think she's got a solution. Like if the bar manager argued that the sky was blue, she finds someone who insists it's green but she has no idea that character is color blind, as an example.    Both of these suggestions potentially make her going back into a joke in and of itself based on her character flaws. Either her over-competitiveness becomes her undoing or she gets bad or incomplete information that she triumphantly takes back to him only to fail spectacularly."
Screenwriting,3br4i1,barnun,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:59:08 2015 UTC,"Option 1 doesn’t really work because I’ve already got all the plot worked out and I don’t want to do a big rewrite just for a small plot exigency.  Option 2 is very similar to the first thought I had. In my notes I have written “Maybe N says something about T should talk to bar manager”. N is a huge gossip so he can be a catalyst for T and the bar manager arguing. I guess I didn’t do this because later N leaks information to the bar manager that lets him know he’s right about the argument. And then says “Ooops! Don’t tell her I told you”. It would be kind of similar to make him the reason for the second round of arguing.  But I could have him feed T bad information or advice that the audience knows to be false. So there’s some dramatic irony there as T heads back to argue with the bar manager and the audience knows it’s going to go badly for her. I think that’s a bit richer plot-wise than just a left-behind object which is basically just a thing happening to be in a certain place and doesn’t really MEAN anything.  Or, I could combine it with my “street scene” idea posted in a reply below. Because T is intelligent, she could be heading to the restaurant to argue with the bar manager but right when she gets to the door she realizes that the argument N provided her with doesn’t make sense. Right as she’s leaving, the bar manager walks out the door and bumps into her. She tries to get away physically, and gets very defensive. The bar manager could literally back her into a corner as she accidentally heads down a dead end.  This is kind of challenging because the  “terrible argument or advice” would have to be something that makes sense on a superficial level but when you think about it more, is actually nonsense. But clearly, there is comedy potential in sophistry."

If she was having a fight and made a snarky remark and flounced out, it would be the perfect set-up in real life to leave something behind.    I don't have a problem with her leaving it behind. Esp if  you plant a mine for that earlier. Like, we see her forget something else so we establish it as a trait of hers.   She's going back to the bar but she doesn't want to see Him again because they fought and she's beginning to think he was right all along. Lots of opportunity for physical humor if you have her try and sneak back in so he can't see her, to retrieve X.   In fact, I'd surprise the audience by letting her get away with it, but once outside the bar she finds a note from Him in the thing saying, ""You know I'm right.""

I don't want to make forgetfulness a trait of hers, but perhaps she took something out of her bag to prove a point to the bar manager and ended up leaving it behind.  So, she recovers the thing then she makes it out the door where the  bar manager is smoking a cigarette and waiting for her.

Don't write yourself into a corner where the only way out is to give your character heat vision when they never displayed potential for it previously.  You have me interested in that your protagonist already had his powers.  Is he/she also already an established superhero/villain?  That's one thing I've noticed about cinematic superhero movies.

I've been making this series and planning it since 6th Grade.  In his world, he is a but one superhero in a world of many. But while he is sort of established and liked (not loved) in his home area of The DC Metro Area, he is either unknown or joked about on the larger hero stage. He is basically low on the totem pole.  And yeah I know. I hope we don't get more origin story for these next Batman and Superman movies and the next Spider-Man.  And thank you! Good luck to you too!

Screenwriting,3bsmf7,franela,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:54:37 2015 UTC,"Ooooh, looks like you've been working on yours way longer than I have, at least conceptually.  Mine is actual a ""superhero / comedy"". I originally intended it to be a straight parody of comic book superhero stuff, but I immediately found the world building and character creation way too much fun to limit myself to nothing but jokes.  My central angle, however, remains. Essentially, it's about a non-super hero who gets dragged onto a superhero squad. Most of the city's population -- including the protagonist -- is getting pretty tired of the local super team. The protagonist is an out-of-luck aspiring journalist who decides to do a story on the heroes, and gets confused for a random applying for an internship. He ends up taking it with ill intentions of exposing them for the assholes they are.  It's intended to be a goofy series that still takes itself seriously as a superhero show.  I don't want to go into too much detail because of the irrational fear someone will steal my idea, but he reveals his intentions to his best friend, who is actually a member of the team (secret isentities and shit).  There are kinks to be worked out,  definitely, but I've just finished my pilot beat sheet and plan to start on it tomorrow actually!  If you'd like, we can discuss our concepts in further detail via PM. We might give each other some ideas!  EDIT: Also, mine would definitely be animated. Yours?"
Screenwriting,3bsmf7,Slickrickkk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:20:28 2015 UTC,"Same with the paranoia about my idea being taken.  Yeah I have been taking this all seriously since I entered high school. But just started writing this year (before I wanted to be an animator). The Nick Script First contest is my first script writing.  My concept is a superhero animated comedy as well. The protagonist is a hero because A.) The Washington DC Area doesn't have prominent heroes and no heroes from anywhere else are trying to help, B.) He has bullied when he was younger and he vowed to help others in need (cliche I know), C.) He looks up to the heroes of the world, and D.) His grandfather was a hero and he wants to carry on the legacy. Lots of reasons I know haha  Mine would definitely be an animated comedy. Too much cartoonish ridiculousness and jokes. The original world for the story would have taken place in The DC Universe so there would have been hero deconstructions and the whole nine yards as the hero goes and learns more about the hero system.  I reeeally like how unique your plot is. The the setup to the premise makes me laugh (they confused this reporter for an intern?? I guess he should have said more than ""I'm here for the interview"", huh?) And there doesn't seem to be a ""true"" hero of this. It depends on what perspective you see it.

Maybe because a while back I had a great time developing a comic strip with an artist.   But every time someone posts one of these, like yours, I get the impression that what they really want is someone to write a script for them from their wonderful idea. See, writing really is figuring all that stuff out you say you can't figure out.   See, everyone has the idea and basic story structure mapped out. You wrote an OP entirely about yourself and how you benefit. What about this ""partner"" you are looking for? Are they there just so you can ""bounce"" some ideas? What if they have their own concept, their own story basics and want you to figure it out for them?   Who, in your mind, actually types the script?   Have you ever written even one feature-length screenplay on your own?   Think about all that and then start or find a group. Take a class.  Meet some other people doing what you are doing.

I am not looking for someone to write the script for me. I think I have some good writing skills and I enjoy writing dialogue, so I would want to handle at least half the writing chores.   If I were to form a writing partnership with anyone, it wouldn't just be about me. I have ideas, they'd have ideas. If we click, we would write the scripts together.

One of my favorites. Even though I'm a millennial, I really relate to Billy and Wyatt. The best character though is easily George Hanson played by Jack Nicholson. He states a few important points in the film, much of which is still relevant today, even if there are fewer hippies. This scene in particular really sticks with me - https://youtu.be/8Gu2ouJNmXc. I think it's some of the greatest dialogue in film history. In my opinion, the themes and ideas presented in the film can easily be shown in a modern setting.

Sure having the exactly correct formating is helpful because the reader is accustomed to it, but fundamentally they are looking at story.   With that said you will find it very useful to use a screenwriting software. Writerduet.com is well respected here, and free.  Basically just write it out:  Ext. disgusting alley - night  Alex throws Bob face first into the concrete wall grinding his face along it, leaving a dripping trail of blood.  A flurry of punches by Alex hit Bob. Bob grabs desperately blindly, Bob grasps a handle, thrusting at Alex, Bob hits Alex with a maggot encrusted milk jug.  Alex wipes the maggots from his face before reaching forward to grasp Bob by the neck.  Bob knees Alex in the balls. Looking around Bob sees a large trash bin. Bob slams Alex's neck onto the edge of the trash bin. Alex crumples to the ground grasping his neck unable to breath.  Bob unzips his pants and pisses on the dying Alex.  That should work just fine as formating. People may bicker about how certain words should be in caps (concrete wall, milk jug, maggots, trash bin) but while that may be helpful it is not necessary.  The bigger thing to look for is not over describing. Try to keep your description near a page a minute. It isn't a hard rule more of a guideline to help you know how much to describe things. The fight I described above, I imagine it as the last about 30 seconds of a bigger fight, my description formatted by one of the screenwriting softwares should come in close to half a page so it is described to about the right length."

You could also look into summer classes at Boston University since I know they have a good film program.  Change your major to film if it's really, truly what you want to do, and minor in writing. Film isn't just for production majors. In addition to production, my school offers screenwriting, critical studies, animation, interactive media (video games) and more. I don't know what your school's program is like, but majoring in film is usually a lot more than just production classes.

Screenwriting,3bp27b,TadBitter,2,Wed Jul 1 17:47:45 2015 UTC,"I'm from Boston and got my first gig as a paid intern by contacting the Massachusetts Film Commission to find out what films were shooting in the Boston area. I got a list, sent query letters and go hired onto a movie. I asked to be placed in rotating jobs and got to meet the whole crew, including the writers and the producers and I was able to keep in touch with them after the movie wrapped. So perhaps you can meet local production and development companies that way. I know for a fact there are several Boston-based prodcos.   As for your major. I too started in film and realized it was for people who want to direct. So I concentrated on a Creative Writing and Literature degree and minored in film, taking as many film study classes as I could (those are great for learning the language of film and identifying themes, etc.) But I learned the most from creative writing classes and literature classes. I even took a class on the Bible even though I'm not religious, because that's where all the great stories come from. That and Greek and Roman literature and Classic and Medieval lit is great too. But the writing classes, while not great (I took everything from playwriting to poetry) taught me how to write under a deadline. Due dates were my deadlines. The classes forced you to write and be creative and that's something you really need to learn how to do - write when you don't want to. Anyway..."

I really respect your hustle there -- I was not that aggressive and probably should have been.  to the OP: I was lucky enough to get placed at a very small Boston production company that was actually involved with development and financing (and -- for a brief moment -- had ties with Farrelly Brothers circle). I got subjected to a ton of scripts, many of them local, but also some NYC and LA projects that were trying to make the indie thing happen.  I've been an unpaid (intern) and paid reader now that I'm in LA. Honestly, I think the only thing thing a lot of companies look for are samples.

I also wonder if I need to be looking for things TV related since that is my focus. I have been looking at unpaid internships as script readers for places in LA that would let me work for home but alas I have been having bad luck.

But none of them are probably TV production companies. You'd really have to move to Los Angeles to get an internship at a place like Bad Robot or Doug Liman's company, etc. so that you can be ""in the room"" with the writers. Most of those entry level jobs are either being a runner or writer's PA. The goal is to be the writer's assistant so you get to be in the writers' meetings and take notes and offer suggestions, with the hope of getting an episode to write during the second TV you're with the show. But until you have the two solid spec scripts, I recommend staying where you are, taking the classes, reading scripts and writing. Then you should move out to LA and try and break in. As for coverage/reader work. Just check Craig's List and Mandy.com.

It's pretty easy to find unproduced scripts to use for practice. Just, if you submit a particular piece of script coverage somewhere, it's a good idea to keep who wrote the script anonymous and not mention what the title of the work is. Ideally, do all that and ask the writer in question if it's all right to use the coverage you wrote on their thing as a sample in a job/intern hunt."

I'm not knocking you, just trying to see where you're at. I'm going to work off that assumption because writing script coverage is what you're going to be doing as a reader. Lots of it, and your bosses are going to want you to do it really, really fucking fast. You don't really start there, you get build up to it skill wise with internships. That's where I'm at at the moment. An accurate job title would be ""Dirty Intern - Still in College."" If there was an org chart, it would be like:   Company's CEO Company's President Company's Creative Execs Coordinator Dog Shit Garbage Bag The Dog Shit's In Me and the other interns  And that's just the way it is.  As far as your screenplays go, just list on your resume that you've written X scripts. They're nice to have, but they're not going to land you an internship anywhere, really. If your college has contests then enter them and try to find out where you placed and, if you think it's an impressive bit, list that on your resume too. Once again, nice to have, but it isn't going to make or break you.   If you look for a Los Angeles based internship, try entertainmentjobs.com. Google film development internships, see what pops up. You've got to be proactive about this. Shit probably won't workout right away and you'll need thick skin, but that's true for any business -- especially for entertainment. Also, poke around your college's career center to see if there're any alumni connections. Those things are freaking awesome, dude. That's how I got mine.  I can't really be of much assistance regarding Boston based work, but the Mass. Film Commission seems like a good place to check. The fact is, though, that the skills folks like us have are not exactly in demand anywhere except Los Angeles and New York. At this point, though, don't be afraid to take a crappy job in Boston just for the experience and resume boosting abilities it might give you an opportunity to grab.

It's also possible to do the trick without the direct assumption agreements, if you can show that it's a whole consolidation, or a continuation, and her lawyers attempted all three methods (why they even attempted to assert the first one, I don't know. It's stuff like that that makes me think she got taken in by a set of low-rent ambulance chasers). They failed to manage the other two, as well.    I'm really gonna have to read her book.

She really doesn't even try to make the case that it is. They have elements in common like a title and space but so what.  Her claim is sort of that the people who were developing her Gravity turned it into Gravity the real movie, after new line was bought.  This may be true, sadly, for her, she has no evidence it's true and judges won't let you sift through a companies internal records unless you are looking for something specific.  So if she knew that on June 12, 2007 someone emailed someone else and said 'hey, let's screw the novelist on this one' she could go check it"
Screenwriting,3bmncn,rickspawnshop,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:43:14 2015 UTC,"I think it comes down to whether or not Cuaron was attached to the film at New Line. I haven't seen any definitive proof of or otherwise, but if he was attached, he almost certainly read the book. I don't think he would have agreed to direct a movie that so closely resembled his own screenplay in title and in premise. He would be forced to write that the screenplay was based off a book rather than his own original work.   Again that's based entirely on whether or not he was attached to the film at New Line. Also it looks like it was her literary agent that made that claim and it seems like her whole case is contingent on that fact. If Cuaron wasn't attached, couldn't WB very easily discredit that claim?"

His search for slumber leads him to dark places to find an unconventional solution.""  Cain Mosni suffers from bad insomnia. After receiving news that every known medical option will not work, he becomes increasingly frustrated. His condition causes him to be consistently late to work, resulting in him getting fired. That night, an even more frustrated, Cain takes a walk through the streets of his neighborhood in an attempt to quell his boredom.   During one of these walks he stumbles across a drug deal in progress. The dealer, seeing Cain, is startled at first, threatening him and asking why he is there. But the resourceful dealer turns the situation into a business opportunity, offering Cain a an illegal solution to his insomnia in exchange for all the pills Cain had been previously prescribed.   After receiving two pills from the dealer, Cain returns to his apartment. On his way back, he witnesses a confrontation between two men that quickly escalates to a murder. Terrified yet enthralled with what he's just seen, Cain goes to inspect to body, only to run away after hearing police sirens.  When he returns home, he can't get the thought of the murder out of his head. He takes the two pills and falls asleep, but for only an extremely brief amount of time. Cain returns the next night, but is cautious. The dealer approaches him with a knife in hand, clearly paranoid. Their conversation turns to an argument as Cain reveals that he didn't bring his prescriptions. As the altercation turns violent, Cain ends up beating the dealer to death and taking the remaining pills he had been given the night before. When he returns home, Cain ends up not taking the pills he as given, and spends a brief time thinking about the murder he committed until he quickly falls sound asleep.  The questions I have are:   Are there any major plot-holes/conveniences within the writing? Is there any way I can tighten up the dialogue? Does the ending become apparent? Is it too ambiguous? Too blatant? Are each character's actions and motivations believable in each scene? Does there need to be more information regarding why we come into Cain's life at this particular moment? If so, do you have any suggestions on how to introduce the character and the catalyst? I'm hoping to make this the script for my Senior Thesis film. Is it strong enough to be a final piece for my school portfolio? Is it strong enough to stand on its own regardless of the context that its a student film?   https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5siyZSfdMdaZnNxRXpUQS0zcjA/view?usp=sharing"

Screenwriting,3blctx,bobfunland666,41,Tue Jun 30 03:56:35 2015 UTC,"This is where you ask your rep if this is a general or if they are interested in taking your project into their studio. If it's a general, it means they like the writing but don't want the project, but just are curious about you and want to meet.  In that situation, about 30 minutes in, they'll ask you what else are you working on? If you're a baby writer (just a term, sorry), they probably won't be interested in that project until it's done. But at least it will be a friendly read when they get it. There's also an oft chance that they might think you're good for something they have the rights to (a book, article, etc). If that's the case, they'll let you know.  95% of these types of meetings don't go anywhere during the time of that initial meeting but you are gaining ""fans"" so to say.   If they are interested in taking your project in to the studio, at the 30 minute mark they will start asking you about that project. What was your inspiration? Maybe thoughts they have.   That said, none of this is a guessing game for you... you should know what kind of meeting you're taking before you go in.  Last, just be yourself.

Screenwriting,3blctx,bobbybittman,9,Tue Jun 30 12:32:14 2015 UTC,"One thing I would add to the good advice you've gotten.  A lot of writers go into these meetings with a ""whatever I need to say to get them to give me money"" attitude, which, is ultimately self destructive for a lot of reasons. And others go in with a ""I'm the world's greatest genius and every word I write is perfect"" which is obviously a turn-off.   Remember that every collaborator who joins a project changes that project a little. If this film goes, it won't be about executing your vision. It will be about the collaborative vision that comes from adding lots of talented people to the project.   So if they seem like they're interested in your project, I think you have a very clear goal: understand what their vision of the project is. See if there is common ground between your vision and what they want to make.  If there isn't, okay, and you want to take their money anyway, you can do that, but know up front that it won't be worth it. You will pay for every cent your get from them in blood, sweat, tears, sanity, and creative motivation.  The good versions of these meetings happen when they come in with good ideas that help you make the project better. Sometimes they're even ""oh wow how did I not think of that?"" type ideas. But sometimes they're more challenging than that, but still good - just because it requires work and shifting the vision of the project some, doesn't mean that the ideas are bad.   But in this sense you are auditioning them.   Also, you don't have to ""sell"" your idea - they've read it - but you are selling yourself. That means communicating that you're reasonable, sane, smell nice, friendly, open to free-ranging conversations about your work.   But it also means that you have an idea of who you are. So you want to have a ""next project"" that is in the same general project of the one they like. If they are meeting with you because of a dark thriller, don't pitch a silly comedy as your next project.   Just relax. Be fun. Be interesting. Have interesting things to say about yourself. Know who you are as an artist and try to figure out how to talk about yourself without sounding like a pretentious jackass, which can be tricky sometimes.   Good luck!"
Screenwriting,3blctx,HotspurJr,4,Tue Jun 30 05:49:30 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about them thinking you want something. Of course you do. Why else would you be there? They didn't give you meetings for shits and giggles.   I can't give you many specifics, but as a business owner, I can tell you the number 1 rule when trying to sell something.  Passion, confidence, and belief.   You have to believe wholeheartedly not only in your script, but in yourself. Know why your characters are doing what they are. Never say something like, I thought it would be cool. That's a cop out, and it's going to sound like you lucked into a good script.  If they ask if you can do something that you can't, DON'T SAY NO. Don't lie, but don't say no. Try to work in experience you do have and come up with a way to accomplish what they want. If they ask if you've ever written for tv, and you haven't, say something like, 'I don't have any scripts prepared, but I have a passion for tv, and I love the way the scripts differ from features, and meeting the challenge of a tight deadline and new content, new situations that relate to trends in television.' That's kind of cheesy and you'll definitely want to be more specific, but the point is, even if you've never done something, relate it to something you have done and describe how it would apply.  But the best thing you can do is believe in yourself, and make sure that confidence shows through (without being arrogant, those two things are not the same).  If you don't have a reason for every single thing your characters do and feel, I would come up with some fast.  edit: autocorrect"
Screenwriting,3blctx,Vultatio,2,Tue Jun 30 05:13:55 2015 UTC,This kind of hard sell is looked down on by most creative execs and producers in my experience. They consider that kind of stuff their job I think.

Screenwriting,3blctx,Lookout3,2,Tue Jun 30 20:40:10 2015 UTC,"Ok, well as you are a a professional screenwriter, I will defer to you.   But I stand by the idea of having a reason for everything your characters do. It is one of the biggest rules in writing and it gives purpose, knowledge, and depth to your characters. And it shows that you aren't just lucking into a decent script, but know what you wanted out of your story and can produce more content. Everyone has a funny story or two to tell just from their own experience, but how many people can come up with new, good, fresh content on a regular basis? Not an easy task. Having purpose in your writing shows that you have thought about what you are doing and can do it again, not just regurgitating something funny your buddy did once."

There may or may not be follow-up, but you can't wait by the phone for it, you'll drive yourself crazy.  All you can do is keep working or keep meeting with other people.  And also remember, the studios have the most money, but they're not the end-all, be-all.  After my meeting at Sony, I never heard back from the exec I met with.

Go into this with the mindset that this script pitch isn't about whether you sell it or not, but whether they buy from you in the future.   There's plenty of posts about how to polish a pitch.

Gonna need some cash for this shit, so hit the ATM, and take out at least $2k.  Shit, son, don't expect to sleep because this shit is just getting started.  Ok, first, take two red bulls and a small line of coke.  This should give you the energy you need to get through the night.  Now you need to spend the next seven hours clubbing - hard.  Drink as much booze as you can.  Get fucking wasted, pick up a hooker, dine-and-dash at Denny's - I don't fucking care, but get genuinely fucked up.  These are Hollywood people, they are gonna know if you are faking.  Okay, now you have about three hours till your meeting.  Catch an hour of sleep, just for effect, and set the alarm to full blast to get you back the fuck up.  Two more lines of coke and four shots of Jack Daniels with Captain Morgan chaser.  Now, you need to shower - quick, because you fucking smell.  Now your clean, you got your nice suit on.  Take off that tie, and open the top three buttons of your shirt, and then connect the fourth button to the fifth hole.  Leave one shoe untied and don't you dare shave or fix your hear.  Call a cab and get over to the meeting asap.  You should arrive about two minutes late, in order to make the right entrance.  Bypass as much security as you can.

Then say, ""Fuck this office room bullshit?  You fuckers wanna hit the club.""  To which they will respond yes, and likely invite you into their limo.  Proceed to party with these fuckers for the next four to eleven hours.  Then as it starts to get late, and the sun starts to go down, be all like ""Oh, oh, shit wait a minute man.  The movie script thing.  Fuck man, I almost forgot.""  Then mumble something intangible, take another hit of coke and chug a beer.  Then say, with passion, ""A big fucking dumptruck full of money for all of us.""  That should win them over, but just in case it doesn't, try adding ""Get Channing Tatum to do it.  And Olivia Munn can wear a bikini through the second act.""   Congratulations, you've just sold your first Hollywood screenplay like a pro."

Screenwriting,3bm5bm,countvoncastro,5,Tue Jun 30 15:58:15 2015 UTC,"Major: Star Wars Episode 2 Attack of the Clones & Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith  Anakin Skywalker. Make him heroic. Make him sympathetic. Make his fall to the dark side a true tragedy. A true loss.   Now you see in Phantom Menace, Anakin really isn't that much of a character. He's not calling any shots, and although he helps the protagonists and accompanies them for over half the journey, he's an accessory. He doesn't really matter. That changes in Episode 2.   In Episode 2 we find him as a fully autonomous character with his own wants and abilities to bring them to fruition. And what are those wants? Let's see-   Going against the code he swore allegiance to win the attraction of a girl he thinks is pretty (let's face it, it's not her charming personality or deep convictions he's attracted to).  Disobeying a direct assignment to make sure he doesn't lose his mother (his motivations are not even close to selfless here, he's clearly more concerned with not wanting to feel more loss vs. actually helping her). Slaughtering a group of indigenous natives for no other purpose than revenge.    And this is just halfway through the movie. I'd change all of this into showing us, ""The good man who was [Luke's father].""  Give him some true nobility to fight for. Hell, maybe I'd give him a, ""damn fool idealistic crusade."" to follow Obi-Wan into.   Something to make me care!    Episode 3, however, can start bringing in the fall. Still keep him noble, but maybe too noble for his own good. Obi-Wan says in Episode 4 that he was seduced into the dark side, not tricked into it, and not forced into it with this contrived, ""Do it or your woman dies."" angle. No. He should be delving into it believing that its for everyone's good, not just his own."
Screenwriting,3bm5bm,Ranwoken,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:43:45 2015 UTC,"I'm going to rewrite the prequels one day. I'll try to keep the seduce quote in mind.   I always thought there should be more mythology in them. They know all about the Prophecy of the Chosen One, but no one questions it. In the Phantom Menace Qui Gon is established as being kooky and far out. I think that even if Kenobi accepts the responsibility of training Anakin he should do it reluctantly, not just because Qui Gon wanted him to and believed, but also to stop him being trained by Windu. There has to be some grounding to the Jedi trying to take over for it to be a believable story, so I would have Windu as a much more shadowy, hawkish character who is actively trying to get the Jedi more involved in galactic politics.   So Anakin is raised amidst an order that is straining apart, with Windu and Yoda in contention, Windu's disciples becoming more and more zealous and less reasonable. Anakin has a weight of responsibility on his back because of the Prophecy that is spouted about, and he is being pulled between the overbearing concern of Yoda, the distrust from Obi Wan, Windu's blatant attempts to get him on side and Palpatine's subtle massaging of emotion.  The first film is therefore the stoking of the fire, one of Windu's Jedi going rogue and being the one responsible for Qui Gon dying. It happens quite similarly to Phantom Menace with Anakin playing a much smaller part. I almost wouldn't have him in the film at all, just introduce him as some strange curiosity that needs to be dealt with in the denouement. It is mainly supposed to set the scene of the politics, the Force as unreliable manipulator of the Jedis' lives and make us wonder about who or what Anakin is.  Film two is the last days of the Republic. We join as the cards begin to fall, it will end with Windu's Jedi splintering and pulling the Republic into a civil war. Amongst that Anakin  is wanting to be the Chosen One, trying to understand what it means and excel. He is clearly close to Obi Wan, but we can see that their relationship (and they actually have one) is taut.   Film three is Anakin racked with the guilt that despite supposedly being the Chosen One he has yet to prove himself and is unable to help everyone. Obi Wan is drifting away from the politics, pursuing the truth behind the Prophecy which he has never believed. Anakin takes that personally and it cements the rift (Anakin and Obi Wan are too cordial when they meet on the Death Star, that fight is just a culmination of the damage in their relationship and to have the last time they see each other before that be the act that cripples Anakin makes zero sense emotionally).  I'd basically take it down a more mystical route, have the Force as an active, entirely unreliable and mostly dangerous entity. Emphasise the danger of unreasonable expectations and of blind trust.  I wouldn't have Anakin ever be a good man. Whatever the Jedi in the first film did to him, it scarred him. He appears to be friendly, but to those that see the real him (and Padme is the only one that does regularly) he is clearly not a nice person. The Prophecy burdens him, but also manifests as arrogance. It's partly as an attempt to reign that in that Obi Wan begins investigating.  Admittedly, that doesn't mesh with the Jedi being a forgotten 'religion' by A New Hope, but maybe that could be worked around by having very few Jedi, they're just very powerful."

Alright, there's a lot going on here, and I'm going to try and pull it apart to look at the pieces and see how they interact.    A cure is created [which] causes a quarrel among those inside [including] a man and his father   Now, this is really, really vague. Now I'm sure you can say these things and have a pretty good idea of how this story is going to go, but to someone reading, it almost sounds like a ton of unrelated events and people that sort of just happen. Let's start at the beginning, your protagonist.  Is it the man or his father? Regardless of which, what kind of person are they? Headstrong? Traumatized? Philosophical? The only reason this really matters is because it helps to suggest what kind of arc your character will be going through. If they're headstrong, they may have to learn to listen to those around them, for example.   Next, we need to know what's really going on here. What is this person, this hero, trying to actually do over the course of your screenplay? Because all we know is that a cure is created, and that people quarrel about it. We don't even know why. I mean, is the only way to manufacture a cure from babies' brains or something? Are there only five doses available ever? See there's a million ways for people to quarrel about a zombie cure, but again, what does that have to do with your hero?  What I'm getting at here is that you need a setup that hits these points: You're hero has to do something or else this will happen. Once you've got that spine, you can fluff it up (just a touch).  Here's some quick examples of what you could do with this kind of setup:  When a greedy scientist invents a cure for the zombie virus, his idealistic son must steal it, and get it to another lab to be mass produced before the undead overrun the city gates.  When an outspoken scientist discovers the cure for the zombie virus, he must convince his father, the mayor, to use it before the city is overrun, despite its sinister origins.  When a man's loving father is bit by a zombie, he must get him through a rioting city to the recently developed cure before his father becomes something much worse.  Just some examples. There are endless ways to take this! Play around and find your best."

Wheres a feature is often close to a 1:2:1 ratio for lengths of the acts, I feel like a lot of shorts have a second act that is just one scene, and a very tight wrap-up afterwards. The net result is that they're front-heavy: 5:2:1 or something like that.   A lot of time to set up the dramatic situation, a single scene to exploit it, and a mini-scene to wrap things up.   YMMV. I've just noticed that with a bunch of successful shorts."

The biggest mistake I see is a bunch of ""set up"" that might be visually cool but does no story telling and then a little bit of actual scene work at the end. You can show how cool the world is WHILE the character is going after their want.   If the cinematography is great you can get away with this but much stronger .... from page one allow that character to go after their want.

When you only have to hold someone's attention for fifteen minutes, you don't have to worry so much about where the end of the first act is going to land, so long as you have a clear beginning, middle and end to your story.

I would try to find the dramas that closely resemble what you are trying to write. A script for BREAKING BAD is going to look and feel different than GAME OF THRONES. BREAKING BAD is a much slower pace with fewer characters. If GoT most closely resembles your own idea, work off of that.   When you say it doesn't fit into the traditional one hour structure, what do you mean? Do you have too many pages? Do you have too much material to fit into the pilot? Are the act breaks not fitting where you would like them to?"

It really has to do with introducing all of the important characters and also setting up the world within the typical page count.  I could leave out a few characters for the pilot, but I've been told by a few (produced & successful) friends in the industry that I should keep billing in mind (main actors are paid for every episode in the season, so you had better include them in every episode, or suffer the wrath of the studio), even though it's still very early in the process.  Do you think it would be wise/acceptable to write in the HBO format (no act breaks or places for commercial spots) for the time being?

They decided to keep their four act structure just because it was the way they had been writing the show and it still worked within necessary parameters.   Suggestion: Since it sounds like you don't know which network you are going to pitch this to, write it both ways. Write it with and without planned commercial breaks.

Screenwriting,3bkss9,Centra_spike,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:16:50 2015 UTC,"I think you're describing most television. Even in long arc storytelling, the framing device used in each installment is some sort of shorter arc. Think about Lost which is about as long arc as possible. Each episode is framed with a character having some sort of individual smaller story, and their own flashbacks (or flashforwards or flashsideways?). On the surface it is episodic, each short arc is resolved by the end of the episode, but there is also a larger story that is being advanced. Some episodes do one more than the other, but both elements are there. It's hard to think of stuff that's purely one or the other, The Simpsons essentially satirizing their own episodic nature, and daytime soap operas being fully serialized."

For example I work in an indie market with not a lot of money floating around, and pretty much the only features that get made are ones that can get made on a shoestring budget with minimal...well...everything.  That being said, pretty much no one is going to say ""This is too low budget, add some armies or battles or explosions"", the lower budget and more contained your film is, (as long as it's still good) the more likely it is to get people interested in it.  Also a huge upside to this is that you can put money for your film towards better lighting/actors/makeup, things to really bring up the production value of the film. As opposed to paying for a million locations/travel expenses/food for days you wouldn't need otherwise."
Screenwriting,3bl9w6,con42scientist,2,Tue Jun 30 05:02:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If you have a good low budget idea, don't hesitate to go for it. I also work in the indie film market. Great contained scripts (especially horrors and thrillers) are in very high demand among indie producers, not only because they're cost-efficient but also because few screenwriters can do them well. And even companies that focus on bigger-budget fare will be interested in seeing what a good writer can do for less money.

He can just say ""after 8 years?"" and the blanks get filled in.  All the talk about the names of people we don't see - maybe leave the backstory for later in the script. Doled out a couple comments at a time.  I don't think we need to know that yet.  When you put this   CAROLINA HAINTS  Growing up in the Scary South  by Sarah Macallan   kind of thing in the center, it looks like dialogue and slows down the read.  Convention says it's just an action para - use quotes or maybe underline.   I think the first 6+ pages are excellent. After that, it feels like you're having trouble getting into the story. I'm also wondering why you chose two male protags?  Have you thought about a woman protag and having her be a distant-ish relation to Sarah?    I'm not seeing enough motivation for the trip. either. I think you need to cut the prologue to three pages. It's very ""prosey.""  Which is not bad, per se but you're on page 17 w/out an inciting incident, an idea of the plot or stakes.  The scary thing was good, it just takes far too long to get to it, IMO.

Screenwriting,3birtl,lexman17,7,Mon Jun 29 15:51:48 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty ambitious story to take on. Good on your for taking the challenge.  This type of story is what I've always called an ""observer"" story, or the ""thematic observer"" story. I think you see this more often with adaptations from novels, which is why Gatsby is a really great example. Your ""main character"" is really more of a narrator than anything. He's the audience's point of view. In a lot of ways, he is the audience. Things don't necessarily happen to him; they happen around him. Which is exactly why it's so tricky to structure. We're all used to a more straight-forward type of story. ""Character wants something - Character faces obstacles in the journey to achieve his/her goals - Character succeeds or fails.""   But when we look at something like Gatsby, it doesn't quite work like that. It seems like Jay Gatsby is the one with the strong, interesting goal (to finally be with Daisy). Nick is sort of just along for the ride. He meets and is instantly charmed by Gatsby, and decides to follow him through his journey of trying to win Daisy's love again.   So why does this work so well? I think it's because of the way Nick is affected by Gatsby's journey. We established that Nick doesn't have a strong, interesting goal, but we never said he didn't have a goal at all. Near the beginning, Nick tells us that he came to wanting to join the new booming economy and culture of roaring 20s New York. He has this dream-like idea of what his life will be like there. When he meets Gatsby, he's smitten. This man is the embodiment of everything he wants to be. When Gatsby takes a liking to him, of course he follows him. Gatsby is, in a way, Nick's vehicle to achieving his goal.  Over the course of the story, Nick observes Gatsby. Learns about him. Learns the heartache and tragedy that's followed him. But more importantly, he really starts to see what life in New York is like. It's nothing like what he imagined. It's fake. Gilded. Beautiful on the outside and rotten on the inside.  Personally, I think that's the key. These ""observer"" stories work when your narrator/observer arcs and is changed by the actions of your story-driving character. I actually would consider Gatsby the true protagonist of that story. But Nick does have an arc, and his arc is actually the theme of the story. We the audience come in enamored and seduced by the glamor, and by the end we're disgusted by it.  So basically, I would suggest you think about those questions for your story:  1) What is your Dad character trying to accomplish? Does he have a compelling, strong goal?  2) And your son character, what theme is he going to carry? Does he learn from his father's life, the way Nick learned from Gatsby's life? What preconcieved notion/paradigm does he come in with that is totally changed by his father's actions?  Another question I would suggest you think about is the relationship between your ""observer"" and your active character's goals. Obviously father and son is mostly self-explanatory, but how does the son relate to his father's goal? Remember that Nick really gets involved in the story because he's related to Daisy; that's why Gatsby reaches out in the first place. I think that's the other really big key to making this type of story work.  I hope this helped at least a little?"

Screenwriting,3birtl,Slickrickkk,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:23:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's a more challenging story to write because structurally, you're telling a story through a character that isn't actively engaged in it. In a novel, it's easier to do that, since it's perfectly normal to spend time in a character's head, hearing what they're thinking, how they're interpreting the things around them, etc. That's not so easy to pull off on screen, where you've got to visually engage your audience on top of the narrative. I just think it's more challenging because when you get down into the scene work, it takes more thought to figure out how your narrator stays in the scene and in the story, while still engaging the audience viscerally."
Screenwriting,3birtl,funnycorgi,2,Mon Jun 29 23:39:05 2015 UTC,Some good examples of scripts where someone other than the main character is driving the plot:   The Graduate The Big Lebowski The recent BBC Sherlock with Benedict Cumberbatch

Screenwriting,3birtl,scsm,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:59:29 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the main character and the protagonist are different people. We've been discussing Good Will Hunting lately.  Will is the main character.  But Robin Williams shrink is the protag, really, because he's the one with the goal and the stakes.  His relationship with Will, drives Will.   I don't think it's an uncommon dynamic in drama.  As for how to make the main character active, if the protag is driving him, he is changing and these changes will be seen in the action he takes.  Dad might be hugely influential, but he can't live the kid's life for him. Just show us his choices ad actions.   The other movie that springs to mind with this dynamic is American Beauty. Also, Secretary."

Screenwriting,3bg82b,turkey_is_dead,31,Mon Jun 29 02:31:18 2015 UTC,"No matter how good your script is some people will like it and some people won't. A producer however has to love it. The reason being he will pour money, time (probably years), and resources into it. He will go around pitching the project and become synonymous with what you wrote, and all producers want to be known for having quality projects. In order for them to do this, they need to not just like it or think it's great, they need to believe it will be a hit and make everyone involved a lot of money.  Let's say objectivity actually exists and you wrote a great script, and everyone agrees. You still need to get it into the hands of someone who wants to make it. Those are two different things. Point being, get your script out there in front of as many eyeballs as possible and mentally steel yourself for the possibility that almost no one will even respond.  Even if someone did, the road to you getting paid well or the script going into production is very very slim. And I'm saying this about the great scripts. That's the reality of this business.  All that being said, I hope this guy loves it and calls you in for a meeting. Good luck and prove all us realists wrong!"

Screenwriting,3bg82b,tbone28,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:49:33 2015 UTC,"Great comment. I would like to add to it.   There is a time to party and a time to ponder. Most people party when they start to see success and ponder when they experience failure. I would suggest ponder when you get even a modicum of success. Improving yourself is the long path you need to take.   If your script sells (you get lucky) and you aren't ready for the success you might not be supporting the process that will make you successful in the long term. It's a long game you need to play. If you have every played poker or tried to make money at it you will immediately understand what I am talking about.   This is why people say you better love what you do because that love of it will get you through the hard times. Separate yourself from the results. Every moment should be supporting your ability to do the most fundamental thing that will allow you to do more of it.   Your stories are passing on your gene's and in a hostile world you don't have one kid and expect the best. You have many children and set them all up for success as much as you can. The fact is, it is a hostile world. Our ability to adapt and the love of the craft is all we have to hang our hats on."

Screenwriting,3bg82b,beardsayswhat,8,Mon Jun 29 06:39:30 2015 UTC,"Nah man.  You get abuse.  I've told people I didn't like their scripts and got told I'm a terrible writer and a bad person.  I'd say in at least 10% of cases people get really genuinely angry when they're told that what they masterpiece is anything but.  It's why I'm hesitant to ever get feedback to people, and especially people that don't have any social capital to lose by insulting me.  Here the other thing:  it's not anyone's job to give you feedback.  It's not even anyone's job to read your script.  Like, why is it a company's job to weed out people from the industry?  Why does that benefit them?  Why would they waste all of the hours it would take to write people lengthy feedback instead of using that time to, you know, make movies?"
Screenwriting,3bg82b,TheWheats56,-1,Mon Jun 29 06:46:21 2015 UTC,"Well, take it this way. If they're an asshole, then they're an asshole. You can't be worried about what someone on the internet thinks, especially if you're offering them a service/guidance. If I want advice for something that I created, I want the honest advice. That forms trust.   But the second part is true. If you write a person/company asking for feedback and are angry you don't get any (even if that person/company stated they might not do it), then that's on them."
Screenwriting,3bg82b,beardsayswhat,3,Mon Jun 29 07:01:48 2015 UTC,"Right, and I as an individual person can weather that because I'm not reading scripts to make money.  I'm reading them and giving feedback, generally speaking, as a way to kill time and pretend I'm being altruistic.  So if someone tells me to fuck off, I haven't lost anything really.  But a company isn't reading to kill time.  They're reading to find a thing to make into a movie.  So why would they bother giving feedback if it doesn't benefit them and they're likely to take abuse for it?"

It's not the rule, but it does happen and is unpredictable, which makes it just a slice bit safer to just not say anything.

Screenwriting,3bec0o,brooksreynolds,6,Mon Jun 29 08:50:37 2015 UTC,I have yet to finish my first feature.  I've finished three shorts. Directed one. It turned out really good and had a great reaction online. I was so proud of it that I think writing something that competed with it held me back. Here is the short if you're interested - https://vimeo.com/75720702  I'm roughly 70-80 pages into my finishing my first feature. I'm really proud of what I've got but trying to connect where I'm at to the ending I've imagined (and written a bit of). Writing this has been an amazing learning experience. I watch movies differently now and understand so much more. I'm trying to finish this so I can start the gears to getting it made (I'm primarily a director/cinematographer so I hope to do that).
Screenwriting,3bec0o,notgravy,5,Sun Jun 28 16:16:14 2015 UTC,That looks amazing... the cinematography is kickass for a self directed short.
Screenwriting,3bec0o,brooksreynolds,3,Sun Jun 28 17:13:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Unless I could get someone I really respect to takeover the job, I'll probably keep doing it.   There are several scenes in my current script that were written for the lighting to tell a part of the story. It's fun to bring that perspective to my writing.  The other thing I hope it helps with is cost. The budget of that short was under $5K Canadian and it is 17 minutes long (albeit all the actors volunteered)."

They were always fed, got to go to a cottage for a weekend and all had a really great time.

Screenwriting,3bec0o,Dubious_X,3,Sun Jun 28 15:41:15 2015 UTC,"I would say the number one reason for me is discipline. I've been able to finish a few screenplays now but before, my thought process would always be towards moving forward. Like I would be writing a comedy screenplay but then I would be thinking about a drama and how I can interweave the two somehow and it would always be a mess.

Screenwriting,3bec0o,blizzardmuffin,3,Sun Jun 28 21:47:45 2015 UTC,"One of my biggest problems is that I always revise within the first draft.

Screenwriting,3bec0o,D_B_R,3,Mon Jun 29 00:22:18 2015 UTC,"Try revising the first ten pages over and over to satisfy your perfectionist itch, then bulldoze your way through the rest - writing nonstop.

I had 3 episodes completed. Why was I so sure it was an awesome idea? Well...  After 3-4 months of working on it part time, I read online that a ""companion"" series to the show I was targeting was given the greenlight. And it was in the EXACT city I thought about. I couldn't believe it.   So I tweaked the screenplay a little more, made it better than before, but then realized there are already 3-5 shows dealing with this subject matter on TV already. So there it sits..."

It's just not. I could see how it'd be beneficial but hopping straight into the work has done me so much good this past week that I feel foolish for ever trying to work in any other way just because.   Not trashing the process of outlining, I get it. It's just not for me. The hardest part of writing for me hands down has been finding my own process. Thankfully, I think I've finally made a dent in that."

What I'm basically doing now is spitting out an outline in script form.   In your experience, what would you say is the usual process as far as what's asked of you? On specs and re-writes?"
Screenwriting,3bec0o,dedanschubs,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:32:54 2015 UTC,"Specs you can do whatever you want. You just can't expect people to want to read your entire script. They want to know it's worth their time first. So sometimes people want to see a synopsis or treatment before they read the script. The few things that I've written for other people/under a producer are all about the outline.   Outlining is a great habit to get in. Breaking story before going to script is a necessary skill. For example if you ever work in TV, it's arguably the biggest part of the job."
Screenwriting,3bec0o,talktomydick,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:45:04 2015 UTC,"How would you suggest I go about trying to improve at this? It's a weird problem. Like, how do you personally outline?"
Screenwriting,3bec0o,dedanschubs,2,Mon Jun 29 00:49:21 2015 UTC,"I spent a lot of time just jotting down ideas for characters, scenes, dialogue. Just a jumbled mess. Most of which never makes the drafts, but helps me find what I need early on.  My outline starts with breaking down the 4 acts (with midpoint in between acts 2a and 2b). Then expanded into 8 sequences, which each ask a question, that is answered by the end and leads into the next sequence. I also have a theme that I'm trying to explore, which helps keep focus.  Then into scenes, where I start getting actual numbers going and see which parts are looking to be too long or short.  Then into a more detailed scene breakdown, with bits of dialogue and other little things I'll want to pepper into the script and don't want to forget about.  Once I've got all that figured out, I'll start drafting pages. And then as new ideas show themselves, I'll adjust my outline as I go."
Screenwriting,3bec0o,talktomydick,2,Mon Jun 29 01:21:37 2015 UTC,Would you say this is a good example of a standard outline?   http://wendago.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/JasonOutline.pdf  The writer of Jason X posted that outline on Twitter a little while back.
Screenwriting,3bec0o,dedanschubs,3,Mon Jun 29 01:49:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a great example. See how it's not just a ""writers outline"" but more of something that goes to producers and gets okayed.   It's easily digestible. You get the tone, length and basic characters from it. The rising action. It's simple to add and change things before it goes to script, like ""Can we add a lesbian love triangle, that culminates in a space threesome in the second act?"" because you're just changing a sentence here and there. It's fleshed out, but still adaptable.  It gives readers a solid idea of what the film is, without having to spend 2 hours reading the script.  And it's also something that can be adapted by another writer, if need be. Fire the first guy, hire some new young kid who just optioned the hottest teen horror script in town and get him to use this outline. The first guy gets story credit."

I don't aspire to be a professional screenwriter, but rather an independent writer/director(/producer). The first couple scripts I wrote were too unproducable to work as my directorial debut. My third was closer, but still didn't seem possible to make using the resources available to me. I spent too much time on the third one, even making a short film set in the universe. I had to start a new project so that I could return to it with fresh eyes after.   I'm working on my 4th now, one that mostly takes place in one location that I will be developing after I complete it. This will be the first script that I actually plan to crank out a ""finished"" draft of.  My writing process is bizarre and wreckless. With my first three scripts, by the time I actually had a first draft written I had already rewritten the story many times. My first drafts are very developed because of this, but more lack specific focuses that are necessary in finished screenplays such as polished dialogue/use of subtext, polished pacing, etc."

I want to get the plot down first, and work on the story a bit later. I need more inspiration though.

Maybe not making a  fabulous living, maybe not writing what they expected, but it happened for them.   Of course, the problem is being genuinely driven and working hard.

For me, the problem was that I didn't realize that writing a feature is actually a tedious, difficult job. Or, to put it a better way, writing a feature can be tedious if you approach it with too much fear or too many preconceptions. If you've never written a feature before, this is almost inevitable, because it takes practice and time to find your groove and process as a writer.

SAME - is for different places/characters at the same time. So, the enemy is gearing up and the defenders are playing poker. You might want to cut back and forth from the threat to the clueless, using the two slugs and SAME.  As for that one, if you are going back and forth several times, you can use INTERCUT after establishing the two locations.  Go buy The Screenwriter's Bible by Trottier.

""Joseph's jaded, forest-green sedan rolls off [a] country road, onto pea-pebble gravel.""  Ignoring the fact that a sedan can't feel jaded, is it important that we know the sedan is green? Moreover, is it important to the story that we know it's specifically forest green? Do we need to know the size of the gravel as well?  Here's the information you're trying to convey:  ""Joseph's sedan turns off the dirt road.""  Why not just say it like that?"
Screenwriting,3bgojg,Dofleini,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:43:15 2015 UTC,"I think the pacing needs to be better. We go to church, we're in the car, his home, church. Condense.  He has garlic on his door, but goes out on a furtive meeting to pick up more?  Then you have a very on the nose conversation about vampires. Admittedly, I didn't guess vampires, but I'm hardly a connoisseur of the genre.   Why not have the second church scene be the first, the congregation wearing the garlic. A guy in the car park dealing the garlic if you want to keep that. A less on the nose conversation when he gets home about the importance of the church now, but with his family.  And I'd agree with what others have said, what begins on page 9 could be brought forwards to after he gets home. Skipping the softball game entirely, keeping the tooth bit.  I think you're being a little too on the nose with things.  The hotline isn't necessary as long as you make clear he's returning from hospital, not prison. Or leave it ambiguous but leave enough visual/dialogue clues that we work it out. And you show that his house is overgrown twice, what's the point in that?  For instance just:   Joseph steps out of the car and stares at the overgrown garden.   Frank hurriedly ushers Joseph into the house, his eyes lingering on the grass and rubbing his hair apologetically.  FRANK  Joseph, the garden, I'm so sorry I haven't been tending it...

Screenwriting,3bgojg,TerryFontaine,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:18:19 2015 UTC,"Hey first and foremost, congrats on writing a 2nd draft. Most people on Reddit can't write their name let along a screenplay.  With that being said, the major problem for me is is nothing happens in the first ten pages.  I don't know what the story is about, don't know who characters are or why should I care about them. It's a lot of humdrum, by the book everyday life shit that's not appealing for a screenplay particularly a horror script.  I am assuming later on, hilarity ensues and shit goes crazy, but if you're not giving the viewer something to hold on to, why should they care what happens in the middle of the story?"
Screenwriting,3bgojg,AndySipherBull,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:19:38 2015 UTC,"First, thanks for the kind encouragement.  I just want to explain my thought process for a moment. I think it could help you help me.  My little personal film philosophy is that a film, if a work of art, should serve two purposes: first, to entertain. Be it a horror, then scare. A comedy, make audience laugh. Second: the film should address some theme or send or message or both. It has to explore some aspect of what it means to be a human being.   So, I didn't want my movie to be scary just to be scary. I wanted to take the time to build up to a scary moment that begins on page 9, which serves also as an inciting incident. By that point, I wanted the world and he characters to be established and cared about.  I get that it's common to arrest the audience from the beginning, but I intended to achieve that with the eeriness that something is not right in the world it is set in, that something is different as it obviously is from the beginning. I hope there is a dread there as the audience waits to see the consequence of that difference.  With that being said, do you think my opening sequences work? If not, how else might I better it?"
Screenwriting,3bfvf9,penilehubris,3,Sun Jun 28 21:26:31 2015 UTC,"I don't usually link Wikipedia articles, but this one is pretty good on melodrama.  August: Osage County is drama - everything that happens, happens because of who the characters are.  Dramas are the kinds of films where /u/cynicallad and I argue about whether there are stakes. Good Will Hunting, Sex, Lies and Videotape. The Hustler. In most cases, there's not much spine, or thruline.  I think most movies are melodrama, technically. Iron Man.  Toy Story. It's not that the characters aren't interesting or whatever, but there's a strong thruline, clear stakes, easily identifiable characters.  You don't argue after seeing a melodrama about why Nemo's father set out to find him. That's what dad's do.   Most Hitchcock movies are melodramas. They are about ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.  The Birds. North by Northwest. But what people talk about after the movie is how creepy birds have become to them and what you would do if mistaken for someone else. What could you do?  They are about what happened, not who it happened to."
Screenwriting,3bfvf9,wrytagain,2,Sun Jun 28 22:45:18 2015 UTC,"Melodrama:       A melodrama is a dramatic or literary work in which the plot, which is typically sensational and designed to appeal strongly to the emotions, takes precedence over detailed characterization. Characters are therefore often relatively simply drawn, and may appear stereotyped. However, because of the long timeframe in which the style has existed, and the variety of formats used, it is difficult to give a precise definition.  In scholarly and historical musical contexts melodramas are dramas of the 18th and 19th centuries in which orchestral music or song was used to accompany the action. The term is now also applied to stage performances without incidental music, novels, movies, and television and radio broadcasts. The term melodrama is often used pejoratively,  to suggest that the work to which the term is applied lacks sophistication or subtlety. By extension, language or behaviour which resembles melodrama is often called melodramatic; this usage is nearly always pejorative.  The term originated from the early 19th-century French word mélodrame, which is derived from Greek melos, music, and French drame, drama (from Late Latin drāma, which in turn derives from Greek drān, to do, perform).

Screenwriting,3bfvf9,poseymund,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:30:32 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, Lumet is making this distinction specifically with regards to the writing process. A movie that's heavy on plot isn't necessarily a melodrama according to his definition. He's more referring to instances where writers come up with the plot first and then force their characters to go where the plot dictates, rather than the other way around. Character actions seem unmotivated or their motivations seem vague and cliche when writers do this, which in turn makes stories feel melodramatic."
Screenwriting,3bfvf9,gotitbadscreenwriter,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:50:19 2015 UTC,"I've always seen melodrama as fascinated by the ideas/characters/scenario, and drama as telling a story via ideas/characters/scenario.   Soap operas are uniformly melodramas, much angst and handwringing and back-and-forthing, but the story itself is perpetually put on pause or glacial pace (if you're rushing it).  Other productions are logical progressions driven by character and scenario, the plot moves and character informs the story, not determines it.   Owen Grady has a connection to the raptors because the story demands it, not because it informs his character. In a melodrama there would be endless flashbacks to his relationship with Claire."

Close enough so that your script at least resembles these pages. That said, there is no absolute standard format within the U.S. film industry. The format used by professional screenwriters can vary considerably from writer to writer - but overall the format used by one professional writer generally resembles that used by another professional writer. Nuances may vary – margins slightly different, a dash here or there, parentheticals used this way or that or not at all – but overall, professional screenplays fit within or near these guidelines.

A well written script about two well-developed and dynamic characters is better than a poorly written script about ten shallow and one-dimensional characters.  So my advice is to focus on those few characters and develop them further.  One strategy can be to write up a ""character sheet"" for them that includes physical, mental, and social descriptions as well as a brief history.  Include their childhood, teenaged years, and young adulthood.  Once you have that done, if it has failed to stimulate any ideas for new content, you could try looking into something like /r/writingprompts for suggestions of scenarios into which you write your character."

Screenwriting,3bh5et,JoshuaHerr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:46:51 2015 UTC,"Okay, well, my advice with redemption stories is to add guilt.  This is where the source of conflict and motivation should come from.  The burden is on them, even if they aren't aware of said guilt or even if it isn't necessarily their fault.  Thus, the story is spiritual at its core.  With this in mind, you're going to have characters w/ different views on this situation/group of people.  One guy may be cynical and wonder why people are even here, since none of them have shown any sign of progress the past few months (ex. telling people you'll quit smoking, lose weight, eat right, etc).  To him, they're just desperate people looking for answers in the wrong places.  Of course, these statements of his could actually be views of himself that he projects onto other people rather than any meaningful insight (someone more logical can point this out).    Essentially, it's his reaction to his surroundings him that reveals his character.  Whatever reason brought him here (work, divorce, drugs, etc), that's what shapes him.  So, you can have different characters judging (or not judging) this set of circumstances that have brought them together based on their backgrounds/prior experiences.  That's what builds them as characters.  I'm not sure how many characters you have or what this place is (strangers in a bar, hippy therapy group, voodoo cult, veteran's affair hospital, church group) so I can't say exactly what or how they should accomplish this.  But the idea remains the same regardless.  You can't change what's been given to you but you can control how you react....that's the idea behind character development.  Action is what gives the character life.  Then, you never know where it goes from here.    Perhaps they leave this place and go someplace else (travelers on a road type thing)?  This is good if you want to centralize on just a few characters.  Driving around and drinking at bars in central Florida so they don't have to deal with work or home life.  Or it flashes back on each individual character like a frame narrative (think of it like the Canterbury Tales from Chaucer)?  This way, it reveals multiple stories/characters and perhaps also how they see themselves (since they're telling the story).  Maybe a variety of different storytelling methods.  Just some ideas to float around."

Generally age is written either as (20s) or ""NATHANIEL, a twenty-something dude..."" but mixing the parenthesis and words just looks weird for some reason. Likewise, (Young adult) is a totally worthless description. Give her a specific age (18), or (20s) or something more descriptive. Try to avoid using adverbs, and instead use more descriptive verbs. Get a thesaurus if you need to.  Capitalize the name of characters the first time they appear on screen. If Alexandria doesn't appear on camera until he sits next to Alexandria, then capitalize her name there. As MaroonTrojan pointed out, you're using too many worthless wrylies. If you're going to use them make sure they're actually doing something important. (sarcastically) is a good one because it's not something usually picked up by context. ""later: int doorway"" is a terrible way to make a slugline. If this is a new location, it should be ""INT. DOORWAY"", but if you're still basically in the same room, you can just slap a LATER on the left. The proper formatting for superimposed text is this:  SUPER: NINE MONTHS LATER   The exact position and color of the text is irrelevant to the story, so leave it out.   The first thing after the JACOB'S HOUSE slugline should be an action line describing his house. What are we seeing while that superimposed text is there? If it's on a black screen, then it should have been before the slugline under a BLACK SCREEN slug. Drop your camera directions if they're not being used well and with purpose. There are good ways to use camera directions in screenplays, but you haven't found them yet. Capitalize PATRICK when he first appears on screen. You're missing a period after ""he's not ours"" and ""when you"". You don't need lines like ""The voiceover plays over Nathaniel arriving at home"" in the action lines. Just write the dialogue interspersed with the action lines, and the reader will figure it out. (kisses Sarah audibly) should be in an action line. That's not even a wryly. That's just bad formatting. ""it was so..."" should have a capital I. You stopped doing (V.O.) halfway down... wtf page is it anymore... did you just give up on voiceover halfway through? Just go use WriterDuet, this is painful."

Protag works on attaining the goal until the midpoint - you decided what that was - so now you connect the end of Act 1 with the middle of Act 2.   How does it end?  There's a BIG THING someplace in Act three, and then a bit of tying up loose ends time at the end.  But before the big thing, the battle royal, the getting the machine/vaccine to work, there's solving the hopeless moment that came from the something that happened at or just after the mid-point.    So, connect the hopeless moment with the end.   Now, go back and figure out what happened from the midpoint to the hopeless moment. Shit happened. Things speeded up. Bombs planted in Act 1 and 2a exploded.   Use cards or paper or post its or what the fuckever works for you.

He has a sketch of a script before everything starts out, which is just a minor guide. Every once in a while he'll write a out a few scenes, or improvise on the spot, and they'll shoot that for the day. Sometimes that's done on the spot with the actors. A lot of pure improvisation from the actors goes on too. This method only work because his movies come out of years of shooting and them chiseling a gigantic volume of footage. You don't really have an unified script to go with the end product. :/  Perhaps one of his (good) movies had a more conventional production structure, but other than MBBN I don't really think so.

Someone who has spent a great deal of time working on himself to let others know this, but misses the big picture. Like an Executive Producer - wink*  He is like a robot in a way, even his laugh sounds like a concoction he devised while trying to think up what is the ""perfect sounding laugh"". Of course, all of this translates into a phony persona and is very unrelatable (to me), which if there is one thing you have to be to be funny, is relatable.

Screenwriting,3bezly,svalbard5,3,Sun Jun 28 17:10:10 2015 UTC,"Box office stats for the biggest studio movies don't really prove anything, because piracy is most problematic for indie filmmakers. The 90s indie film bubble has burst, so it's almost impossible to get your movie financed unless it's ultra low budget or studio level. If you make a million-dollar film or a five-million dollar film, the odds that you're going to get a theatrical release are extremely small. Your best bet is online distribution. The problem is that major streaming services won't take your film if it's been pirated and is already floating around the internet (which happens ALL the time). So, if you put your film on the internet hoping to get some buzz to get play on a major streaming site, your film is inevitably going to be pirated, making it worthless before it ever hits a major market. If you send out your film to anyone for some sort of consideration, there's a good chance it's going to be pirated, making it worthless. Even if you just show it at a festival, believe it or not, there's a chance that it will be pirated, making it worthless. For a lot filmmakers out there trying to break in, piracy is the thing that prevents them from even getting a seat at the table."

If the 1-5 million dollar movies had been turning in massive returns, then Hollywood would still be making them and releasing them theatrically.   They don't so Hollywood doesn't.

Coen bros were already 10 years established when the Indie bubble inflated.   More opportunities for new filmmakers breeds new talent.    And it has NEVER been easier to be a filmmaker.

The Coen Brothers started in the 80s, yes, but they financed Blood Simple by calling up business owners in Minneapolis and asking for investments. You can't really do that in today's economy or industry.    The point isn't whether or not it's easy to be a filmmaker. The point is that piracy is a serious problem for indie filmmakers. Crowd sourcing helps you raise money to make a movie. Not distribute it.   And, no, I'm not reversing my argument. I don't know where you got the idea that I'm suggesting that digital piracy burst the indie bubble. Never said that. The fact that the indie bubble burst means that digital distribution is the only viable way today for most ultra low budget filmmakers to distribute movies. Piracy makes this much more difficult.    As to your question... that's exactly my point? These guys got their start because they were able to make a first ultra low budget film that was financially viable, allowing them to go on and make bigger movies..."

Because the people who drive popularity on TPB and elsewhere are intelligent, have a low tolerance for bullshit, an obsession with quality and a hatred for time-wasting crap."

Synopsis: In the pilot we meet Ben Gibbons, a rebellious 16 year old who has been expelled from his last school and is forced to attend Fury Charter, a boarding school for kids with special abilities. Ben tries to keep his normalcy a secret while meeting his new teachers and classmates. Meanwhile, Kodiak, a well known but aging superhero, is brought in by the headmaster despite having any skills at actually teaching.  This is a pilot I wrote intending to produce as a sort of radio sitcom. So in lieu of scene direction and sluglines I've describes what will be the accompanying audio. I'm fully aware of any potential copyright infringements, and though the page count is a bit long, I imagine without any visuals and with Gilmore Girls-esque timing it should more or less amount to a thirty minute listen.  Questions:   1) Can you track the story through just the dialogue and written sound cues?  2) Is there enough conflict?  3) Are the characters compelling?

Screenwriting,3bboyu,noposters,2,Sat Jun 27 19:22:36 2015 UTC,"Capitalize the names of characters when they first appear on screen. Usually give an age, too. SEAN (20s) picks up the phone...  Don't put in things the audience can't see or hear. How would an actor convey that he's supposed to be dialing Ely? Either just have him ""dial a number"" or press the ""ELY"" button on his contacts or something. What's an ""unknown person""? This sentence seems meaningless.  (V.O.) is normally put to the right of the name.     KATIE (V.O.)   Usually you don't name characters ANONYMOUS unless there's a big dramatic reveal later. Just name her Katie from the start.  You need an action line right after the ELY'S APARTMENT slugline. Something like ""KATIE (20s) holds the phone to her ear, a panicked look on her face.""  ""NIGHT"" is better than ""SAME TIME"" when actually producing movies. Keep in mind that crew look for keywords like ""NIGHT"" and ""DAY"", and ""SAME TIME"" just wastes people's time trying to look back to see what the last slugline was.  The conversation ""What's happening?"" ""I am now."" doesn't read well. Restructure that so it makes more sense.  You don't need ""TITLE CARD: END CREDITS"". Generally you can just fade to black, have the voice-over, and whoever's producing it can make the decision whether or not to have the credits roll as he's talking. This doesn't seem like something critical to the story, whether the credits are rolling or not.  The idea that people are being overly dramatic about a phone dying can be funny. I can see some physical actors really hamming it up. But the joke at the end where Sean doesn't answer his phone doesn't really make sense. I think that part can either be dropped, or be replaced by a different joke. Maybe like an ad for a cell phone charger charity, in the style of those animal shelter commercials with the ""Arms of an Angel"" type song in the background."
Screenwriting,3bboyu,magelanz,2,Sat Jun 27 21:22:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I'll get to the formatting fixes later.  What I'm most concerned with is the structure of the overall joke. Is the idea that people take the life of their phone as seriously as their own being communicated properly? Would it help to maybe have a ""straight man"" added to be the voice of reason? Like someone who is concerned at first, but flips when he learns that Ely is not dying, his phone is. And going off of that I was wondering about Katie's line; do you think she should explicitly say ""his phone's at 1%"" or something vaguer?  Also, I'm glad you brought up the ending. I went through several alternates. One dropped the bit where Katie is trying to defibrillate the phone. Sean hears Ely ""die"" on the other end and wails to the heavens in agony. Ely interrupts him by arriving at his house asking to borrow a charger.  I like your idea of framing it as an ad too. That may work even better.  Anyway, thanks for the advice. Gonna get working on it again ASAP."

Sometimes it's best just to get a few friends over, read it out loud, and see which one plays out better.   I don't think you need a straight man for this one. Katie doesn't seem to have much of a purpose though.  One last thing, how do you pronounce ""Ely""? At first I was thinking it was Ellie, but the one L through me off. Usually it's a good idea to have easily pronounceable names. People feel more confident about reading things (both in their head and out loud) if they can pronounce it."
Screenwriting,3bboyu,brian4994,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:15:10 2015 UTC,"It's just an alternate spelling of Eli (as in Elijah).   And Katie is in there to set up the premise in a grounded way separate from Ely, who is in his own world at this point.

My only constructive criticism is maybe taking that last scene where Sean's talking in his southern drawl, and draw out his monologue. I think having that buildup of the emotional self talk V.O. going on will really build up the final punch of Ely leaving his message.  Another idea with that in mind could be having Sean build up that V.O. scene so much that when the phone rings, he doesn't even notice it ringing. He's too into his monologue about losing Ely. As he's doing this, his audio muffles as this cell phone ringing becomes the prominent sound. The camera pans down slowly to the phone to reveal ""Missed call from Ely"". Cuts to black, then goes into the message at the credits. You could keep the incoherent monologue ramblings of Sean continuing through the whole thing in the background as Ely's message is played."

Technological science is fundamentally different from media arts. Engineers actually create tangible stuff that feed the overall human need, both mind and body. Media art creates stuff that speaks to the mind more than the body or the basic human needs. In a normal world, neither is more important than the other. But in an extreme world, engineering (technological science) is far above media art. You can look into past instances of national priorities in times of total war. That's why engineers can say that and not look like a narcissist."
Screenwriting,3b80mi,Fuchsia-Paper,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:07:58 2015 UTC,"I would say the economic rules that govern engineer salaries are more... rational than those that govern writing. With engineering jobs, education, internships, and practical ability matter a lot more. Most of the skills that engineers possess are quantifiable.  With writing, nothing is. We don't even know how this shit works. This is young art, less than 150 years. We don't agree on anything. Everything turns into a flame war. This inherent chaos makes it easy to believe that anything is possible.  If a high school senior told me he was going to make the NBA, I'd have a rough idea of how plausible that was, if he had records, if he was a McDonalds all-american, if he was an AAU champ, if he was over 6'4. Writing talent doesn't work like that. Everyone believes they have an outside chance of breaking in out of nowhere, making a ton of money, beating out the old pros and sharps. And the weird thing is, they're right.  You raise a good argument, but writing is way, way, crazier than the pay scale for engineers, especially on the aspirational level."
Screenwriting,3b80mi,A_Classic_Fragrance,6,Fri Jun 26 21:19:07 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that you're adding a magical quality to the arts. And you're not alone. Most people do this. But I think it's a dysfunctional way to view this type of work.   And I think some of your views upon other types of work might be incomplete. I chose engineering as an example because a lot of the intangible skill sets overlap with the arts like creativity. I probably should have chosen programming because I'm more familiar with it. Because the amount of intangible, non-quantifiable skills are almost exactly the same as writing. It requires a tremendous amount of nebulous creativity. And the end product quality is just about as subjective.  The interesting thing I've noticed is that creating video games have developed this same magical sheen as movies and books. They didn't have it in the 90s.   I don't think writing skills are as unquantifiable as we commonly think. And other job skills are actually less quantifiable than we commonly think. And this leads to an undervaluing of the arts in our society."

They are both vital and important and keep a check on each other, but if not properly balanced you are not in touch with reality. So we get lots of terrible scripts written by people who think they are simply brilliant, and a set of people who hold such high standards (or simply fear testing them in the real world) and are afraid to finish, never release, or never even get started because in their eyes what they do is never good enough and never will be.

The first time someone said, ""Let's face it, you are asking people to give up months or years of their lives and millions of dollars to make a story you made up,"" I was shocked. Never occurred to me.   I mean, I had the information but - it just didn't factor into my thinking.   (1) A statement like this always prompts someone in the room to say they write as a hobby and have no interest in getting their work picked up. Let's call them what they are: timid people who shield their ego from failure by not trying.   Sometimes. But people do exist who paint just to do it. I think Dickenson was one who truly didn't want the selling her work, getting published portion of the program. I can't say I spend a lot of time thinking about selling because I just want to write one really good script.  I have to do that, first, and I can't think beyond that."

Yet, that's essentially what screenwriters say every time they set forth to write.  Is this who we really are?  I don't recognise myself in that statement.  I am a storyteller, give me two hours and I will enchant you, confuse you, beguile you, delight you, surprise you, terrify you, mystify you, and make you laugh and cry and love and hate and take your breath away.  Or not. Art is subjective after all.  I do this for many reasons, but mainly because I can.  Screenwriting is a hobby for me, for practical reasons such as not being in a position to live and work in L.A.  Due to the fact that I can enter contests and have my script if it is deemed worthy enough read by my heroes and heroines (Coppola being one of those) and stand a chance at winning some cash and cool prizes I have decide to write for fun.  I see screenplays  as works of art, they may be mere sketches compared to the finished product, but that doesn't mean they cannot be beautiful in their own right.  Does wanting to create a work of art make me a narcissist?  Maybe, so what, In my mind all that matters is the story.  I doubt I will ever win a contest or take a meeting, but I will have a lot of fun, enjoy the learning process and maybe every now and again something that I wrote, that I created (sometimes from where I do not know)  may just make a reader laugh or smile or even weep.  What a gift to be given, and what a gift to bestow onto others.   The joy of entertaining each other, illuminating the darkness in each others lives for a brief while.  Do I want to be a great screenwriter, of course, I enjoy it, it's fun for me.  Is what I am writing about important?   I doubt it?   Who knows maybe I'm channelling Chekov?  Or maybe I 'm just ripping of Tyler Perry?  I think it is interesting to understand and question why we write, not sure how important that is though, in the scheme of things."

Hopefully they don't discourage you, as they're meant to do the reverse (writing is rewriting!).    A general note: 38 pages is too long for a comedy pilot (it should be more like 25 or 30). Any reader who gets a hold of your script is going to go into it with the mindset that you don't know what you're doing (no matter how good your writing is) because the length isn't right.  Scene description: there are prose problems that, while minor at a glance, will exacerbate the aforementioned mindset problem for any reader (they're looking for any excuse to discount your script): ""tired looking"" should be hyphenated. ""Manager"" should be ""the Manager"" (unless Manager is his name). Also,  we're probably going to be seeing this guy again, so he should have a name. But go further than that and try to give him some personality. what does he look like? how did he become the manager of a burger joint? what does his think about the job, Evey, etc.? In a comedy pilot, even minor roles are going to be played for laughs, probably by a comedian, so try to write something that a good up-and-coming comedian would love to play.   At the beginning, put us in Evey's shoes. Starting with a disembodied voice can be interesting, but I'm not sure it's the best choice for your story here, because we don't know what she's relieved about. Maybe show her staring numbly at a clock, waiting for the seconds to pass until she can leave. Also, why does she say ""oh thanks jesus"" if her shift isn't actually up yet (unless it's her first day, wouldn't she know that the manager will want her to stay until 10:30?).   Probably shouldn't call the wife ""Bitchy Wife,"" because this is going to turn off some readers, especially readers looking for female-driven material.   Page 4: same problem with character names/personalities. If this is a tv show and these are her coworkers, you should introduce these guys to us. Do we need them?   Biggest problem for me in the cold open? Your joke doesn't have a punchline. We see these guys putting weird stuff into a sauce bottle and then you cut right to Evey walking to her car... Maybe the couple gets sick eating their food and throws up all over the table, which backfires on Evey because she has to stay late and clean it up. There are lots of ways to do it, but you need the joke to pay off somehow, the because the simple idea that they put stuff in the food just isn't funny on its own. The joke needs some sort of narrative to it.   You've probably got this sort of general advice before, but you should try to get your hands on some produced comedy pilot scripts (many are available on the interwebs) and study the way that tv comedy writers introduce minor characters and keep their pilots moving at a breakneck speed."

Screenwriting,3b8uzn,lwarrent,2,Fri Jun 26 22:29:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I can agree with this part:   ""Jurassic World is a film that illustrates that on a micro level - the entire plot is put into motion because no one thinks to check the Indominus Rex’s tracking device before putting unarmed humans in its pen and also because no one thinks to check the security recordings ...""   The simple fact, though, is that in the real world these kind of tragic stuff-ups occur ALL THE TIME.  In one famous example - if you were writing a story about the Queen of England .. the most powerful and protected person in the entire of the UK and you had a scene where a random person off the street wandered into the castle past dozens of guards and hundreds of staff to have a chat with her .. you'd be convinced it was implausible.  It was ridiculously implausible.  But it happened.  If your film's plot is about a passenger jet run by a major airline that suddenly ran out of fuel in the middle of a normal flight?  That's implausible .. the number of checklists and safeguards they have to prevent it is mindboggling.   It was ridiculously implausible.  But it happened.  Imagine that you were watching a World War II drama about a teenager in the Hitler youth .. which has a plot twist where the teenager suddenly discovers one day that he has an identical twin brother he's never met.  Oh - and the identical twin brother happens to be Jewish.   That's an inane plot device.  It was ridiculously implausible.  But it happened.  The good news, though, is that ""this isn’t some demand for Shakespeare"".  Just as well -  because Shakespeare uses some of the most inane plot devices possible.  The entire plot of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' is set in motion by a guy refusing to let his daughter marry someone - to the extent that he goes to the Duke and begs for permission to kill his daughter instead!  A few scenes later, all is forgotten.     What about the end of Romeo & Juliet .. which involves kids killing themselves in a complicated plot that makes anything Jurassic park does seem logical?  There's a strong possibility that he's just whinging because he doesn't like some styles of films.  -- Mac"
Screenwriting,3b8uzn,Mac_H,-1,Sat Jun 27 13:11:46 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point. Sometimes things that are so ridiculous that they happen in real life WON'T BE BELIEVED BY PEOPLE when you tell them. Try telling people certain stories in real life and they won't even believe you. If you then throw them into a movie over and over it's not being done even for some kind of point, it's being done because it's the easiest way to do it. It's easier to just toss all reality out the window and explanation than it is to actually come up with a plot that makes sense.   Having ONE thing that makes zero sense, and hinging the entire story on it can be more forgivable in something like Snakes on a Plane or Piranha 2 or something. But to consistently have things like not checking the tracking device before sending men into the pen with the most dangerous dinosaur on earth is stupid. Things like the guy feeding raptors with a pole with a loop that he'll easily be pulled off of is stupid. Things like not having an evacuation plan. All this AFTER three fucking movies of dinosaur disasters on the same island. That place would be a security nightmare for the people running it and everything would be accounted for.   Also, characters need to be real, just in the sense that they do what their character would do. A wuss doesn't suddenly become a brave hero just out of the fucking blue, and like in Prometheus, a guy who was specifically hired in the chance of discovering alien life, doesn't fucking run away at the site of a dead alien, then later, when confronted with a live obviously looking dangerous fucking scorpion vagina, try to pet the fucking thing and let it kill him. The scientists don't just detect oxygen and pull their fucking masks off without scanning for anything else or wondering about germs or viruses or anything toxic in the air. Just little shit like this is not hard to ask for, and it's shit that a first time screenwriter would be torn to pieces for, but people hopping on franchises and big budgets with established careers are able to get away with because money.  Comparing Romeo and Juliet killing themselves to stupid bullshit in Jurassic World is ridiculous. You're trying to be the arrogant version of the opposite of pompous."
Screenwriting,3b8uzn,Arakin,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:56:38 2015 UTC,"this tyranny of low expectations is why big movies can be, and often have been, so terrible. Why get the story right when the audience simply does not give a shit about it?   Why indeed? Faraci has stated his belief that cinema is largely a populist art, that movies are generally for the masses. But he also believes that films should cater to his arbitrary standards of goodness. I don't think those two beliefs can co-exist peacefully.  What Faraci fails to realize is that the people who write these populist films bust their asses to attempt Faraci's imperatives:   The plot must make sense The film must have basic definable structure Themes must be clear and identifiable Characters must have clear arcs and/or motivation(s)   However, any number of variables can turn a good script into a terrible movie, and vice versa. So when it comes to a critic's opinion of the final film, the outcome is arbitrary. It's all a matter of taste. Does Devin Faraci have poor taste? Well, I don't agree with him on a great number of things, but I don't think he has poor taste in film. However, his tastes are his and his alone, and populist films often just aren't made to cater to the tastes of people like Devin Faraci or even myself (full disclosure: I also wrote film criticism for CHUD, but not to the degree of success that Faraci has achieved).  While I also think Jurassic World is a pretty junky movie, the film is doing what it needs to do to succeed. It's a box office mega-hit. Audiences generally like the movie quite a lot. And, like nearly all of today's franchise blockbusters, it's ostensibly critic-proof.  A film's characters and story don't have to be crafted the way Faraci believes they should. Normal audiences and critics alike will readily acknowledge a film's shortcomings even if they LOVE the film, so just how much do those shortcomings matter? The truth is that people are either going to like a movie or dislike it. ""Movies should be good""? No. Those who make populist movies should try to please as wide an audience as possible. But they're still gonna fail A LOT, for a whole multitude of reasons.  We all wish there was a formula for making ""good"" movies. But it doesn't exist, and it never will, just as there is no real formula for making ""good"" food. Serve something beautifully and masterfully prepared, and someone's just gonna hate it. And humans have been cooking food for an estimated 1.9 million years. We've only been making movies since the late 1800s."
Screenwriting,3b8uzn,thetravisnewton,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:26:57 2015 UTC,"I think his point is that 'good' is not subjective, but objective. To illustrate this, he uses the analogy of a film that's been shot out of focus. No one would say that a film in which the filmmakers unintentionally obscured all the visuals was a well-made film. He's saying you can apply the same yardstick to plots. If the plot doesn't make sense, it's not a well-made plot.   He's also saying it's sad that people's expectations are so low.   I mostly agree with him. The analogy I like to make is with food. You go a restaurant and the food arrives and it's burnt to a crisp or it's raw and poisonous. It's not an opinion to say the food was badly prepared, it's a fact."
Screenwriting,3b8uzn,CelestinRay,2,Sat Jun 27 08:31:12 2015 UTC,"I see you like food analogies as well! Here's where I disagree on a basic fundamental level — I just don't believe films can be objectively good or bad. Show a carelessly made film to any audience and some people are going to like it.  To take your burned food analogy a bit further — let's say you're cooking a grilled cheese sandwich, and you burn it to a crisp. That is a glaring technical error, akin to shooting a movie out of focus. But plot and character are much more ethereal and complex than that. It's like adding chopped parsley, smoked paprika, or parmesan to your grilled cheese. Adding any of those things still makes it a grilled cheese, and they all would add flavor and finesse, but some people just don't like parsley, paprika, or parmesan. Some people won't even notice you added them."
Screenwriting,3b8uzn,thetravisnewton,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:24:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, I suppose you're right. This is something I've been struggling with for a while (as writer, rather than an audience member) can a work of art be objectively good or bad? Most of the time I think it can, then sometimes I think it can't. I'm always flip-flopping from one view to the other.   Slightly off topic...   If there is no objective measure then as a writer, I find it sad -  there's no yardstick for success. How do you deal with this? Just make work that you personally are proud of? Just enjoy the process of making it? Ignore people that don't like it?"
Screenwriting,3b8uzn,CelestinRay,2,Sat Jun 27 14:16:35 2015 UTC,"When I wrote film criticism, I did it as a volunteer. Sure, I got free movies, but it was an unpaid gig. So there was no monetary indicator of success. So I did it for a lot of reasons. I did it for experience. I did it for validation. I'm proud of most of my work because I think it's honest and coherent. So was I a successful film critic? I didn't even do it for three years. But when I decided to stop, I was more experienced. I felt validated and proud. So I consider my time in film crit a personal success.  Now, with screenwriting, my ultimate goal is to pay the bills by makin' movies. Unless I'm a screenwriting prodigy in my late twenties (not likely), this goal is a long, long way off. It's also pretty unrealistic. So my short term goal is to write a movie that I would be really excited to see, even if I wasn't the one who had written it."
Screenwriting,3b8uzn,thetravisnewton,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:38:09 2015 UTC,"But plot and character are much more ethereal and complex than that.   Yes, and no. Filmmaking is an art and a craft. I reject the notion that there is no such thing as bad film writing (whether or not such writing is the fault of the writer).   There are clearly films you see - and I haven't seen JW, so I can't comment on it - where the film isn't in command of what its doing, and parts of it may work but other parts clearly didn't. One shouldn't presume that every choice is a conscious choice or a wise choice.   Something can be well-crafted, but not to your taste. Something can be to your taste, but not well-crafted. Not everybody can see the difference but I think it behooves writers to learn to recognize craft.   Faraci can be infuriating (a post he made about last year's black list leaps to mind) and misanthropic, but I think he is also one of the rare critics who actually recognizes and understands filmmaking craft. He wrote the JW article about how one death in the film was filmed in a language that was inconsistent with the rest of what the film had done with that character (in response to a lot of twitter comments from viewers about how that death seemed out of touch).   http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2015/06/15/the-strangely-cruel-and-unusual-death-in-jurassic-world  Very few critics could have written that article. What is says isn't groundbreaking or earth-shattering to any experienced writer or director, but shockingly few film critics understand what he's getting at there."

I think Jurassic World is actually an excellent example because you can so directly compare it to Jurassic Park.  Jurassic Park's characters are so much better than they needed to be. They are even better than they are written in the book. But because they are so much fun, the movie works on a whole different level than Jurassic World.  Yes, JW is successful. How much more successful could it have been (especially over the long haul) if it had a heart? What if a character that we actually cared about was killed instead of digital extra #179?"

I don't own it anymore.  If the producer wanted a version of the script involving horses in the car chase, then it isn't the producer changing someone else's script - it is the producer requesting that you change HIS script.  And I think it would have been a pretty cool and memorable scene with the horses in the car chase!  -- Mac  ('True Lies' (the American remake) had a great scene with not only a horse in the car chase .. but Swartznegger on a horse riding through a posh building and using the lift.

Time travel exists and that's all the characters/audience need to know.  There's also lots of other goodies in that conversation.  Bruce Willis being older and wiser mentions the waitress with a shorter name which would've hurt less, speaking to him in french because it was something JGL wants to learn but hasn't yet.  Bruce Willis being from the future and telling JGL to go to China instead of France.

From what I remember the scar wasn't there all along, it appeared once the damage was done and old Seth's body was corrected on the fly to keep in line with what was happening to his past self. If scars appear once damage is done to a person's young self, why is it unreasonable for limbs to disappear as they're removed in the past? It's all far fetched/impossible no doubt, but in a fictional universe where thats how time works when two of the same person are in the same world, there werent any events I can remember that contradicted those rules. Again I might be wrong, but everything stuck to those guidelines and as long as it was all consistent with the established rules, thats fine inside a fantasy setting.  Keep in mind that they're in the same time when this all takes place. If they were still in their respective time periods and this was going on it wouldn't make any sense, but when two of the same person are in one world at the same time things get weird. There's no way old Seth would have been without legs that entire time because in both of their timelines, this is the first time it's happened. When old Seth went through his own life he never encountered these events when he was younger. It's all brand new and time is working to keep things consistent."

He's not under time pressure at this point, he's under survival pressure!  In Save-The-Catese, that's the break into two moment of the film. The ticking clock is some future event that must be averted/attended/completed or all will be lost. It runs in the background.  Here's one from an 80's classic: The Golden Child. The love interest has to be saved before the last ray of sunshine stops touching her body, and the shadow slowly creeps over her body as the finale plays out.  EDITED TO ADD: Also from Golden Child, for the first part of the story you have the time pressure of rescuing the Child before he's forced to drink the blood, and we see him get lower and lower on his supplies of leaves."

The movie setup relies on the audience expectation that it adheres to the ticking clock trope, the jeopardy multiplied by the entire society in the film... everyone has the ticking clock as we see in the shot of the infants with the crystals already counting down their truncated lives.  The moment when Logan and Jessica realized that their chips have been shorted out ends the trope for them, but rather than undermine it, the expectations embedded in the audience experience with the trope magnifies the effect of the moment when the characters, and the audience, realize that the countdown is gone.  For something that is within the narrowest definition, it's hard to get better than the classic D.O.A., in which the protag must solve his own murder before the poison overtakes him:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.O.A._(1950_film)"

The more the curse spreads across his body, the more intense and out of control the situation is getting.  Then at other times, the curse seems to slow down or even lessen.  And all of this progression is linked to the three stories going on around him.  Not Ashitaka himself.  And of course, it comes to the eventual climax where Ashitaka is willing to let the curse completely consume him in order to fix the three conflicts (and more realistically, save Mononoke)."

Screenwriting,3b7wzy,X-Mars,5,Fri Jun 26 18:09:57 2015 UTC,"I would generally say this is fine, but there's an important exception.   Some people never finish anything. The moment a project gets hard - and they all get hard at some point or another - suddenly another project becomes much more appealing. And part of that reason is that other project is easy! You're not actually elbow-deep in it, shoveling your way through, so of course it seems like it's going to be easy.   Only you can know if that is what is going on here. I will say this:  It should take you more than a couple of days to decide that you're so stumped that you have to move on. That's either a case of laziness or a case of not knowing how to tackle hard problems.   A lot of people tackle hard problems by saying, ""Oh, I don't know how to do this,"" and giving up. They may repeat that a few times. But that's actually not a good way to solve hard problems.   The right way to solve hard problems is to think about them for a while WITHOUT trying to solve them. Actively resist your tendency to propose solutions, and just spend some time thinking through all of the aspects of the situation that is giving you trouble. If solutions come to you, that's fine, jot them down and KEEP THINKING.   This is part of why, sometimes, talking to somebody about the problem can help. In the process of explaining the problem to them, you end up doing what you're supposed to do: think about the different aspects of the problem without actively trying to solve it.   If you are the sort of person who always has this problem - that you always leave a script halfway because it gets hard, then I would say that you absolutely, positively should NOT do that. If you don't usually have this problem, and you've spent some time thinking about the story problem the right way, and still want to move on, then it's fine to."

I scrolled no further. Here are a few reasons why:  -- read your first sentence: MATT and MIKE crash into the door. Think about that for a second. Think about what you're writing/saying, what image you're planting in the reader's mind...... When I think of ""crashing into"" something, I do not see two guys entering into a space through a door. Burst in, barge in, pummel inside, etc. all may give me the sort of visual you're going for, but ""crashing into"" doesn't. So right away, in a single sentence, I'm not really ""trusting"" you as a writer. And I apologize --- I know that sounds horribly harsh, and please believe me --- I'm not trying to be mean. I'm trying to give you some honest stuff you can USE in all your future writing endeavors. So the takeaway: really THINK about what it is you're trying to convey, and choose the best possible way to say it. Unless you meant, of course, they literally crashed into the door, like in their car, or whatever, and if that's the case, MY BAD!!  -- now read your dialogue. Out loud. Better yet, have somebody read it to you. Then go look up the meaning of ""on the nose"" dialogue. Cuz ya nailed it! And sorry again, but that isn't a goal for us..... In fact, on the nose dialogue most of us strive to avoid. These dudes are saying stuff they might actually be thinking but highly unlikely they'd say something so blatant like that. If one grunted or groaned with his lighter box, made a big deal of all the effort he's putting in and the dude actually WITH the heavy load saw him/ heard him, he could easily give his buddy a snarky ""are you fucking shitting me?"" sort of look and it'd be way more real than the dialogue you have. Again, if you know anyone who actually talks like this, and you're merely emulating --- well, my bad again!  And it's kinda that way with all the dialogue on the first page --- it doesn't seem real -- at least not to me. It's so totally on the nose it's difficult to read without chuckling...    Maybe you got crazy awesome on pages 2-5 and if I missed out on that, my sincerest apologies....."

If this idea is so important to the story then it should pervade the story so that when it's said or revealed the audience might be surprised or intrigued but feels that it makes sense with what they have been watching up to that point.

There's nothing more you need to say because we all know what time travel is. If he's using a specific device and you have a specific piece of science you want to add as to why it works, add it, but keep it just that simple. i.e. ""This gun can rip a hole in time that I can step through."" BAM! You're done. We get it. One thought, and you're probably already doing this. But it would be great if he has some wounds from the start (from a previous time loop) that this character isn't aware of. He himself when your story starts doesn't understand how or where he got bruised. And someone should keep asking him until he figures it out. Again, just a thought."

Screenwriting,3b6h2n,wrytagain,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:36:12 2015 UTC,"You could go the analogy route.  You see those scenes where two people are talking in a diner and one of them uses the salt and pepper shaker to indicate how two cars are going to trap the armored truck (napkin dispenser) in a narrow alley.  If the character has something visually interesting that he or she can use as a prop and analogize it in layman's terms in a funny way, that could buy you a lot of exposition.  There's also a famous quote attributed to Humphrey Bogart where he reportedly said, ""If I ever have to deliver exposition, there better be two camels fucking in the background.""  You could have the exposition take place somewhere that's visually interesting.  Some movies have talkie scenes in strip clubs for this reason.  (Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels).    Or have it take place during an action scene.  It's been a long time since I've seen it, but I feel like in Terminator, Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor have their first ""Who are you"" conversation while being chased by Arnie.

Screenwriting,3b3dhb,zombdi,-7,Thu Jun 25 23:30:16 2015 UTC,I consider myself an author. I don't really use techniques in my writing or tools for that matter. I am interested in story. I feel more like a painter of stories than someone that has a formula. I feel like I am crafting historical documents of which I don't want to use formulas. I want to craft history and write inspired by my life writing and explore inspiration.  Writing to me is like what you see on the radio. It adheres to forms. Writer's concern themselves with techniques and tools and they to me lack inspiration in their writing but still want to write. A writer doesn't wait for the inspiration to come they have tools and techniques that they can use to generate story.  I have to wait. I have to wait until I feel like writing to write. What you created would be useful to a writer because it can channel their finger energy into writing something. It's not useful to me because my writing method is more based on caring enough to do it than generating 5 pages a night.  Writers can write with no thought of inspiration. I can only write when I am inspired and I am not really interested in tools.

Please use a definition that establishes why grammar and language are not tools whereas something like this is. Painters use tools all the time, like easels and brushes and scrapers. They also use cognitive tools, like breaking images into component shapes and perspectives."
Screenwriting,3b3dhb,Belerion,-11,Thu Jun 25 18:44:38 2015 UTC,"A tool would be a formula, like a writer might author a single story. Then use that narrative arc for seven more books. An author keeps writing his first story over and over again and is always fearful and slightly worried they won't be able to do it again. A writer has no fear as a novelist because they have all of these books that detail how to write a book to focus on. A writer memorized techniques like the 36 characters that exist in narrative or they outline their story.  I just sit down and write and I have been doing it long enough that I have a relationship with my writing ( read self ) I get bored of my imagination.   The writer doesn't get bored they can crank. Writers write to genre and think of the end product as needing to be sold. Writers write with audience in mind. Authors write with self in mind. I write for me. A writer is doing it for someone else. A writer is trying to please someone. I am trying to please myself. I want to see myself in my writing a writer wants to see effective use of tools like story arcs and they can talk about their characters like they are people. I base my characters on people I know. I use the real names of the people I know. A writer makes up a lot and has techniques for creating events and story lines. I base my writing on my life and the lives of those around me. I use where I live as setting. A writer uses exotic locales. I am also focused on what has not been written and a writer wants to write the next Vampire book or something with zombies. Writers typically flesh out an author's genre , an author typically creates the genre.  The genre I am exploring is stuff that has not been done before the genre. Like installing a 300 foot tall computer in down town Cincinnati. It's never been done but because I wrote about it. It might happen.   There has never been a domestic animal exhibit at the zoo. You have never seen the zoo put the SPCA out of business. You have never been able to adopt a kitten at the zoo. It's never been done but because I wrote about it. It might happen.  There has never been a final art form. There has never been an open mic for dance. I wrote about it so it might happen.  I write with business and culture in my mind and I am genesizing culture in my writing as an author. That is uncomfortable to do for a writer unless I go ahead and plod out the plot structure so that writers can flesh it out. I am sort of like English Literature Infantry. Writers are like the Air Force. They fly through the story lines and arcs I fight and live and die for.  My entire career as a writer as it turns out owes a debt of gratitude to gene rodenberry from who art directed star trek because cell phones and tablets and large screen televisions never existed when the original star trek came out and now they do. i take writing very seriously. authorship is on the front lines of what tomorrow looks like. we spend our time thinking because well, most of you do not, it all comes to a halt if authors stop writing, authors, in all forms, we are the reason there are writers. gene rodenberry fleshed developed something that inspired engineers. i don't have to inspire engineers on small products. I can inspire engineers into large projects. I can also inspire an end to euthenasia and an overturning of gangsta rap and hip hop. gene rodenburry props became real surprisingly because i don't think engineers have a lot of imagination. i don't have a lot of engineering in me but i know i can inspire a toon of engineers to build a 300 foot tall computer or i can inspire a zoo to become a domestic animal shelter and i can inspire people to go to an open mic and dance to their favorite song. that's what I write about. it's not easy to do that. the universe wretches at the thought and quite frankly WHO AM I to do such a thing.   i crawled out of the crab basket and crawled back in. the other crabs noticed."

Get a job that you think would land you in an interesting place in 5-10 years if your writing career doesn't take off ... and then write like hell in your free time.   When you talk about lack of progress, I kind of shrug. The normal advice to evaluating your progress is compare something you just wrote with something you wrote two or three years ago. But you can't do that until you've written multiple features, or pilots, not really.   If you haven't written a solo feature yet then, yeah, do what you have to do to finish it, but setting unrealistic goals - and a feature, a pilot, and spec by the end of the year when you haven't completed one of those things is an unrealistic goal - doesn't help."
Screenwriting,3b49j3,HotspurJr,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:34:32 2015 UTC,"I mean, I know it's a marathon not a race and from what I gather a realistic career as a writer really doesn't gain traction until your 30s, I just don't want to look back at my 20s and find that I ""floated"" around industry jobs too much. Definitely overanalyzing things.   Development I get, but editorial, that's interesting. You mean like assistant editor type routes? I basically know that I'm in the right industry and I'll be happy with any job - I love being on set, I'm just too comfortable in commercials and comfort = not learning anything. Office PAing is a cut rate but it makes me nervous and THAT excites me.   Thing is is that I know on set PAing is satisfying work because I do love being on set, but I'd hate to be late 20s/30s and still PAing like a few of my peers. And the route there is just co-ordination and PMing which does not appeal to me at all.   This is why I sort of want to keep the writing part out of it because I'm an infant in regards to any semblance of a career as a writer. Unrealistic goals? 100% it's something I need to work on. I guess I'm trying to find the balance between patience and complacency."
Screenwriting,3b49j3,goodwriterer,4,Fri Jun 26 02:42:45 2015 UTC,"In the decade+ that I've been out of film school, I've seen classmates go from assistant editors to editors to directors on major TV shows like Gray's Anatomy. Not everyone, of course, but I've seen that happen.   I was having coffee with a writer today who has a pretty busy career and he got his start in editorial.   Editing is a kind of rewriting. It is probably the most writing-like of any of the production disciplines.  But if you want to write you have to write. It's almost July. I think 6-8 months is a reasonable amount of time for a relative newbie to write a feature. Shorter than that is optimistic, although some people are much faster.   But I think pushing yourself to write to some arbitrary deadline is a mistake. Push yourself to write: make sure you get that ass-in-chair time every day except those days when you're spending 12 hours on set. And that's not Facebook time, that's not reading screenwriting blogs or this forum. Actual writing time.   If you don't have pages to write then work on an outline, if you don't have an outline work on coming up with ideas. Every single day.   Just do that. Make that habit.   Once you're doing, okay, then we'll talk about, how long it takes you to outline something or how many pages you're getting done in a day.   But saying that you're going to get multiple things done in the next six months, when you haven't proven to yourself that you can do any one of them in a reasonable time frame, is a classic case of the planning fallacy. People always vastly underestimate how long it takes them to accomplish a given task, even if they've done it multiple times before.   Just get your ass in the chair in front of the keyboard when you're not doing anything else. You want to be making your living as a writer in 5 or 10 years, then that, more than any other choice you can make, is going to help you.   And if you can't do it, then nothing else you do is going to help you, either."

I know it's the answer and I can dance around ideas of all these little career shortcuts to get in a writers room but it ultimately means bupkis if I'm in there with nothing to show. Production procrastination is still procrastination; much of the short scripts I have have been complete sidebar ideas that have jumped into my head while on page 20 something of a feature. And yep; facebook, screenwriting blogs, reading all the industry insider books, trades, blacklist scripts or cramming my head with scriptnotes/nerdist writer's panel podcasts is all time that's better spent writing.   Really do appreciate the no nonsense advice. It really helps to pull oneself out of one's own head.   Best of luck with whatever it is you're currently working on!"

Screenwriting,3b3gev,TheWheats56,-4,Fri Jun 26 00:38:36 2015 UTC,"Just to let you know, first few rounds of competitions isn't anything to really brag about."
Screenwriting,3b3gev,Slickrickkk,4,Fri Jun 26 02:00:24 2015 UTC,"Actually, to be fair it is. Most contests get so many entries that they only pass the top 10% out of each round. The main selling point of a contest is usually VIP judges or passing them to a production company, so they need to whittle down 8000 entries down to 10. Making it to round 2 means you beat out 90% of the other scripts submitted, which means you're at least doing something right.  It's not something I'd put on a resume, but I think it's certainly something to find encouraging!"

Screenwriting,3b3gev,devolka,8,Fri Jun 26 21:47:02 2015 UTC,"Snark aside, you can join just about any free screenwriting community and chances are the scripts will be rather bad. But what you really want to find there are perfectly mediocre scripts rather than just terrible ones.   The best mediocre learning script is one that's pretty okay but maybe with some formatting challenges or structural problems, unproduced so you only have the script to go off of (just like if you were a production company). They also are good enough to be readable and that helps highlight what was done wrong or poorly.   I've read dozens of scripts for contests, and learned firsthand that pacing action is critical and just how a block of text that's slightly too long or should have been two blocks can greatly slow down the pace of a script you are reading. I also learned what 'visual' writing was compared to regula prose. A good script won't have these problems and a bad script will have bigger problems, but a mediocre script will SHOW (not tell) you how the devil is in the details. I think that's better than just reading a script with zero redeeming value.  Student scripts and script contests are also good places to look. And were they not too god-awful to read I'd even send you a few of my earlier works I dug up from school. :p"
Screenwriting,3b3gev,Valerie_Monroe,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:44:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks--good points! Would you mind explaining a bit more what you mean by ""visual writing"" vs. regular prose?"
Screenwriting,3b3gev,Valerie_Monroe,3,Thu Jun 25 20:41:23 2015 UTC,"Reading scripts (all scripts, really, anything you can get your hands on) is the best training, but reading some by amateurs is a great way to learn this part. It's damn near impossible to explain otherwise, but I've found I can always tell when a novelist is trying their hand at a screenplay. The best way I can describe it is that you feel like you're being told a story rather than having a scene described. There's an immediacy and succinctness in a well-written scene, like you only reading words as long as that image would have been on the screen.  I'm not knocking prose, of course, but it's a different medium with different conventions. A script will ONLY contain what is seen or heard, leaving the actions to speak for themselves. A prose writer will often use over-descriptive verbs or flowery language to describe things, which can make the pages seem to drag. Each page is only a minute on-screen, and if it takes longer than that to read the page then chances are it's been written a bit too prose-y.   Again, this is something I've only learned to notice reading by reading stacks of scripts. I have won't claim to have any idea how to write it decently, but it's one of those things that you don't notice when its good as much as you do when it's bad."

Screenwriting,3b4nqk,con42scientist,2,Thu Jun 25 22:58:01 2015 UTC,Buried beneath the bad dialogue is actually something quite brilliant I think. I get a Smokin' Aces vibe when I read this script. It's actually entertaining to read.  I think all the F wording is over the top but if that's what you're going for then don't take it out. My suggestion would be to punch up the conflict and the dialogue between the Jaime's a little more. Lose the expired eggs for a funnier situation that still characterizes their ineptitude. The reactions of the store clerk are great and it's quite comical.   I would also ask this: What is the purpose of this piece of writing? And does this accomplish that purpose?
Screenwriting,3b4nqk,writermaker,2,Fri Jun 26 00:27:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks! What dialogue do you think is specifically bad? The Smokin' Aces thing is a huge compliment, I love that movie and I'm glad it's entertaining to read.  The F wording is what I'm going for but I agree that I can take it down a bit. I'm planning on shooting it so I'm going to probably interchange it with other curse words on the day.   Punch up the conflict and the dialogue between them, got it. I'll comb through it again and see what I can do. Any suggestions?  You know it's funny you ask that question, because usually everything I write has some big huge outline and mission statement and pages of notes taken before it hits Final Draft. This is the only film that I've written where I didn't do that. I just had these characters in my head and wrote out what they would do in this situation.  The overall purpose would be a bit of statement on relationships, only framed against the degenerate lifestyle and convenience store robbery. A bit like Shaun of the Dead. At the end of the day I want to say that relationships are hard, they don't always work out, you can throw yourself into them and become who the other person wants you to be, but ultimately changing yourself for them won't get what you want. Relationships are fleeting. I think the last two pages of Jaime's dialogue pretty much sums up what I was going for. It could definitely be more laser focused though.  Sorry for the diatribe, and thanks for the feedback!"
Screenwriting,3b4nqk,writermaker,2,Fri Jun 26 00:47:55 2015 UTC,"By bad dialogue I mean that if you want to keep the over the top F word usage then the rest of the dialogue has to pick up the slack. Otherwise, as the other poster suggested, it comes across as amateur writing. So an example would be the fourth line from Jamie. It's too explicit and comes off as something an awkward teenager would say. Read it out loud. It needs to be less explicit and more edgy. Something like: ""That's not what I mean. I'm talking about being balls deep, eleven minutes in and the head boards about to break"". Jaime ""love it when you sweet talk me"". Something along those lines. What I wrote is bad too but it's headed in a better direction. Can you see what I mean?  The brilliance is in the vision though. I can tell that you have a vision in your head and it was interesting to hear you say that it was just something that you had up there and you let it flow. That's a great start because I have met so many writers that don't have that vision and that voice inside them. Learn to cultivate it. The real trick is to take that vision and translate it to the page. That's when it becomes art."

I once wrote 5 drafts of a script and spent 2 years on it before realising the idea was a bust, that it was fundamentally flawed, that it could never work.

Stephen King never does, either, come to that.  Your vomit draft is your outline. It keeps the energy and inspiration and allows you the freedom to let the story and characters take off, become,  lead.   Then you start the writing which is called rewriting.

At least by ""rushing"" out a draft you've got a beginning, middle and end, and then you can refine it.  To use comic book writing as an example of how dispirate methods can get, one of my favourites is Brian Michael Bendis, and he writes in a screenplay style where he tells the artist how many panels on the page, what bits go where etc. Alan Moore on the other hand (for Watchmen as an example) would write pages and pages of stuff about the room and the ""feel"" with no instruction for the artist, and would basically allow them to interpret it how they wanted.

Screenwriting,3b1i62,In_Parentheses,9,Thu Jun 25 05:52:42 2015 UTC,"The art of (screen-)writing has something to do with the ability to evoke pictures in the mind of a reader. To evoke pictures, you can't just descibe facts. Sometimes you have to use poetic words and sentences. It can be just a word you change that makes a line feel like magic, you don't have to write long prose sentences.  Still: screenwriting is much more economic and matter-of-factly than writing prose, some compared it to writing Haiku. So, yes: there is a fine line."

Which details are key? Which are unnecessary? Brevity sometimes gets a bad rap, it seems, on here --- but I think it's important in that one of our missions, at least as I see it, is to ensure we don't bore our readers. We want readers' eyes to move down our pages with ease, and their minds able to conjure (quickly, i.e. without re-reading 3 and 4 line paragraphs) the places/people/action we've set forth. If they get mired in too much unnecessary stuff, if they start asking ""Why do I care about this again?"" or big blocks of showy text nudge them to skim rather than hang on our every word (I embellish, but you get my drift....), then we're not doing our job very well. If, on the other hand, the style of our prose captures their attention and pulls them in, draws their eyes down the page, and the web we weave nudges them to keep turning pages, curious and needing to know........ THEN we've done our job pretty well.   Or something like that."
Screenwriting,3b1i62,JoniB22,3,Thu Jun 25 11:45:31 2015 UTC,"Neither of these are great examples because Good Will Hunting had a ton of help and when you're writing something that's in development you have a lot more leeway. Celeste and Jesse was written by established actors so producers and agents and studio executives will read their scripts much differently than a run-of-the-mill spec from an unknown writer. My personal philosophy is to be economic yet add a splash of panache if you can. You're setting a tone for the reader and you want to reel them in. Sometimes that means ""unfilmable"" descriptions. But the key is to find the balance so you don't tick off that 22-year-old reader who's going by ""the rules"" yet make it exciting and different enough to make them interested. Not an easy task, but that's the goal."
Screenwriting,3b1i62,TadBitter,4,Thu Jun 25 17:54:50 2015 UTC,"These are nonsensical rules. It basically boils down to this, a reader will either love or not love your script. (By readers I mean studio readers, or contest submission readers or blacklist readers etc). Your script can be excellent and beautiful and still be rejected because it's just not their thing. Great scripts by working screenwriters get passed on by Hollywood all the time, just like great novels get endless rejections before getting picked up.  A lot of the time it's craft, but equally it's just not their thing, due to the subject matter, tone etc. The more mainstream your work the less likely that it's subjectivity rather than craft.  Once they don't warm to your screenplay, they will likely skim it, looking for the beats of the story and picking up stuff here and there depending on who they're writing the report for or whether a synopsis is required.   Now they have to justify their decision so they will write what they feel. And this can be anything from your description to structure etc.  There's no way around it and almost impossible to tell from one to the other.  This is why screenplay coverage services are so popular. They have a vested interests in actually reading and finding the good things in your script, to keep you coming back as a customer. They tend to write synopsises(is that a word?) too.  Bottom line, learn from actual great screenplays, not from what some reader's idea of a good screenplay is. If you're getting the same note from multiple readers then you should seriously consider taking it on board. Otherwise adopt the feedback that makes sense to you and ignore the rest.  Movies are subjective. Trash at the box office can make billions and beautiful meaningful films can go largely ignored. Everyone has their own taste. The more mainstream your writing and the more commercial it is, the higher the chance of getting through to readers, unfortunately."

He is scrutinising his thumbs. He is wired. Now he's lighting a cigarette. Now nothing is moving but cigarette smoke. And no sound other than the beautiful lachrymose saxophone.  The man in the chair is MARWOOD. Twenty-five years old. Milk white with insomnia. Glasses like Lennon's and a sweet face behind them. Seventy-five per cent good looks and the rest is anxiety. This is a long haul with unspecified destination. Only thing certain is there are still hours to go. Hours and hours have stagnated in here. Drifting in cigarette smoke and settling with the dust.  And everything looks ill. The walls and furniture look ill. Daylight looks ill. He exhales a huge bouquet of smoke. It's blue. Shifts again and runs hands through his hair. It's black and could do with a dose of Vosene.  MARWOOD reaches for a bottle of beer instead. Swallows a stale inch with eyes on the move... they navigate the globe and it seems to disgust him. Keep moving and good God in heaven is this what he sees?  A kitchen extends off the living room. But much worse. The living room doesn't have a sink. This room does and it looks like it's vomited. The unwashed and the unwashable are stacked to the height of the taps. Every horizontal surface is covered in naso-visual horror. Here are the remains of fish suppers and the newspapers in which they were dispensed. Here are the saucepans filled with unspeakable liquids. Here are empty wine bottles and dead flowers. Roses in black water like knuckles of congealed blood. Here is a frying pan driven vertically with a partially fried egg still attached...  The view stops MARWOOD in his tracks. He's come in here and brought the titles with him. He stares, as though witnessing this panorama of degradation for the first time."
Screenwriting,3b1i62,JimJesusBrando,2,Fri Jun 26 04:53:24 2015 UTC,"Part of the beauty I think of actually constructing dialogue and beats within a scene in screenwriting is the demand to condense your descriptive prose and, in doing so, improve the quality of that prose. The kind of amateur, drawn out prose that I think most writers get criticized for at one point or another is based in redundancy. For example, in that Good Will Hunting excerpt you noted:   ""The bar is dirty, more than a little run down. If there is ever a cook on duty, he's not here now. As we pan across several empty tables, we can almost smell the odor of last nights beer and crushed pretzels on the floor.""   While that example is kind of an anomaly, and most resources would advise you don't embellish to that extent, it's still effective and relatively concise. Honestly, it's as long as the typically amateurish description you'd encounter that is based more on conveying a locale than a tone.   The bar is dirty, only a few customers scattered around. Cabaret tables are littered around the room; there's carpet on the floor but it's covered in a layer of stains and scuzz. An open bathroom door nearby reveals a heinous toilet emanating stench.""   Yeah, it's got a bunch of descriptive words, but you're meant to derive your own tone from the ingredients put there and it just ends up being redundant and clunky. I think the kind of prose you find providing descriptions in screenplays has its own language that makes the story flow. It's like the most subtle kind of narrator offering their own thematic dimension to the story by lending a specific tone to the descriptions."
Screenwriting,3b1i62,swlnugget23,2,Thu Jun 25 07:34:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think color is the issue, it's about...   Being concise. If you can be colorful in about as many words as you can without being colorful, no problem so far. Information that can be can/must be conveyed by the director. If what you're describing can't even be properly drawn, you're just wasting time.  On the other hand, sometimes you have to add detail or exposition that the director must know for later, but is unknown to the audience at that point in the script, or that the director must somehow find a way to convey in one way or another (for example, in the Thelma and Louise script, there's a description that says one character picks up a gun owned by her husband, but there's no dialogue or action to explain to the audience that it's owned by the husband, the director has to handle this by making the actress hold the gun like she's not used to holding it suggesting it's not hers). Avoid doing that whenever possible though. Not being generally shitty. Even if you're concise and you're giving out good information, there are still uses of metaphors, similes and other literary devices that just plain suck because they're cheesy, forced, awkward or distracting: in ANY medium including those where there's more room to be purple. So I'd ask... is it worth it? There's always going to be people that hate color for color's sake even when you're not really abusing it, so my suggestion is that you only keep the lyrical lines when you absolutely love them, not when you simply like them.   Screenwriting can be fine art, but when you're trying to sell it, think of it more as applied art where function takes precedence over aesthetics. You can make pretty blue prints or sheet music, but don't let that get in the way of impatient producers trying to make pretty buildings and actual music."
Screenwriting,3b1i62,OpinionGenerator,2,Thu Jun 25 07:57:24 2015 UTC,"Like anything regarding screenwriting, there's no solid line in the sand.   You have to tell the story good enough to hook the reader while also avoiding getting too far away from what's filmable.   Look at the Good Will Hunting example. The first line is conveying that the bar is a dive. The second line is for the reader to help get across what type of dive it is [no food]. The third is a mix. It's something that filmable and something for the reader to help bring the scene alive in their mind. When you read the whole thing, it gives you a very clear and vivid vision of the setting.   Now, look at the Celeste and Jesse Forever example. It tries to do the same thing but there's a lot of extraneous detail. It lists everything she's eating, the number of newspapers, her laptop, the television, the channel on the television. Even after all that, the writer still has to come right out and say ""She is clearly a culture vulture"" so you have a clue of what the hell they're going on about. I haven't seen the movie so I don't know if the next stuff was set up in a scene before but I had to think a minute about what a ""C and J"" sign could mean [duh, hand signal]. And the end stuff is fine but it's more of an actor's direction. I wasn't too surprised to find out from wikipedia that the movie was written by a pair of actors.   tl;dr - Entertain the reader. Don't make the reader work to try to figure out what you mean."

Been a while since I read it, but Celeste is a successful business lady, runs a media company or something. Jesse is an unemployed artist. So it's not just useless details about what she's eating, they are contrasting the two lead characters.

Conversely, if Jim is crossing the street to grab a donut, don't go on some long description about how he crosses. It just doesn't fit.  Don't get caught up on doing it all the time when you're trying to convey something, but I think it's OK if it's done sparingly and with purpose, as is most things in screenwriting, IMO."

We can't see this, and in the dialogue not a half a page later, the girl says this herself so it's redundant.   You have a pretty good set-up, but some of it doesn't make much sense to me. If the man knew about the killer following her, wouldn't he be suprised or worried to find her on his doorstep? Instead, they have this short dialogue exchange in which she tries to sell him cookies.   Later, the mom says she'll explain things, but she doesn't. Wouldn't she at least explain who the man is because, even after finishing the script, he feels like a total stranger.

Pick some film with dialog you love (although I encourage you to skip the famous monologs and probably to avoid Tarantino and Kevin Smith entirely). Pick some scenes. Transcribe them.

You ARE in. I moved to LA in 1991 with no contacts or friends in the area, and no job. I worked as a temp and ate ramen for most meals and stole bagels from temp jobs while I wrote scripts and did improv 6 nights a week.

But I never really wanted to do anything else, and I am now a working tv writer and very happy I stuck it out.  If you move out and want to work as a writer for film and tv, then you have to go ALL IN. There are people all over Hollywood, Silver Lake, Los Feliz doing exactly what you're doing.

This attitude is what will kill you. You shouldn't look at the lower level jobs in such a negative light. Why? Because you're meeting people in the industry. 90% of the people that have the job you want started by getting some producer their coffee for free or minimum wage. Some of the best advice I got early on was that the first few years working in hollywood are filled with mundane, boring tasks that are meant to weed out the people that don't really want it. Furthermore, you're learning from the bottom. The fact that you say you have no industry experience shows that you need to learn how everything works. Stop thinking you're entitled to these jobs. If you're not willing to do the lower level work, why should you be granted the opportunity for the good jobs?

Work hard, work with a smile on your face, come up with smart solutions and you will be hired or have your name passed along in a tight community of production coordinators. Treat your PA work as a business, take it seriously. If you don't think you'll be learning valuable job skills working as a PA, then you don't know PA work.   (I also became a production coordinator within 4 months because a lot of gophers can't handle more than a month of gopher work. Show that you're smart and can be trusted with more responsibility, and you'll probably get it faster than you plan for.)  Second -- Get a job outside of the industry only if it pays you better than you'd be making as a PA/coordinator AND you dedicate your free time to writing and opening lines of communication with other filmmakers. It will do you no good to move to LA and get sucked into a 9-5 cycle where you spend zero time on writing/shooting/cutting. Move literally anywhere else and do that. I know several people who have moved to LA with big movie dreams, gotten jobs outside the industry to live more comfortably, and never set a single foot into the industry. When you get home from the bank/insurance company/cubicle and your roommates want to grab food and hit the bar, you have to sit down to write.   In summary: production gigs = low pay but great potential for learning/connections while non-production gigs = slightly better pay, more comfortable living situation but zero potential for learning/connections."

But I was also thinking of aiming for ways to meet with some directors / etc.  I have access to a pretty baller rooftop area, and could try to set up meetings with a couple people there.  I am also curious about an actor, I'd be lying if I said this script wasn't written with one actor in mind, and I am genuinely curious about how I could go about having some kind of meeting with him.  I don't care what it would take, I would invest $1k, $5k to buy bottles of Dom P, or whatever I need to even just to sit down with  him to talk about the concept to see if I could get him on board.  I really think he would get on board.  I doubt the chances to connect through twitter are great but I wonder if there are other channels to go through.  I'm very serious about this and have the ability to put $$ where my mouth is to a certain extent to get through some barriers of inertia.

If you've got enough to pay their overall fee, then hiring a casting director (especially if the initial job and payment is primarily aimed at securing name talent to the lead role, etc) can be quite affordable. If you're able to offer a solid chunk of pay for said talent's attachment, that makes the CD's job easier, and a CD's job is all about setting up meetings with actors.   It'd be up to you to use such an attachment to get the rest of the production resources together, of course."

The idea of actors' faces/headshots: THAT is a great idea. A rich old asshole told me that he does that before every script he writes, to set the characters in his head more firmly. It is such a pain, though, trying to find the right face. If you had a database of actors headshots, categorized by race, gender, age, etc- and seriously, what actor is not going to want to be in that database?- and make it searchable, I'd use that.

As soon as that develops into the commission of a fuller treatment (ie. character biogs, episode outlines etc) or a script, I won't go forward until I have a contract which includes a payment agreement.   Obviously if your guy is an agent then he wouldn't usually be paying you upfront or setting up a contractual agreement (at least in the UK). He's there to get an idea of your work so that he can sell you to production - who would then pay you. Its a good idea to do a little good-faith-work in this situation.

A page of intro about the idea, some specifics about the characters and the concept.  Maybe some ideas about locations or episodes.  Basically a rough sketch that would explain what the series would look like.  A cop show?  Is it Brooklyn 99 or is it The Wire?  It's going to be hard for the two of you to define any real terms in a written agreement because so much of that will be out of his hands.  For example, let's say you write up this thing, he takes it to the network, they like the rough idea of doing a cop show but want to attach another writer they've promised a job.  Also they don't know you.   So, where do you end up?    Are you an EP?  Are you a staff writer?  Are you getting a paycheck to go away?  All that stuff is dependent on factors that neither you nor this other guy can accurately predict.  Best thing for you to do is start communicating via email.  Make sure your name is on every document you send.  Make sure you have copies of all that stuff.  Wouldn't hurt to register it with the WGA (probably won't help, but you never know).  Then, at some point, one of three things will happen:  1)  Everyone turns it down.   By far the most likely scenario.  2)  He tries to sell it without you.  3)  He tries to sell it with you.  Either way, you'll have the ammo to send in a rep to get you a deal.  It might be a small deal.

I write TONS of treatments pre contract -- in fact, I'm procrastinating on Reddit because I have one due tomorrow.  To not only a real producer, but a huge producer.  Do I like writing them?  Not really.  I'd rather write the script.  But the producer you're talking to (the producers we all talk to first) aren't buyers, they're sellers.  Just like you.  You don't have a buyer yet.  No buyer, no contract.    In short, do a little work for free.  See what happens.  Move on to the next thing.  If the guy is legit, don't spend any time worrying about getting ripped off as that part is out of your hands too.  But also be aware he might hate your treatment and move on to the next writer.  Or, sometimes more common, five writers are all working on treatments at the same time and they'll pick the writer they like the best. (Or sometimes the least, but who has the best chance of getting this product sold).   Welcome to the game.    It doesn't favor writers.  It never has.   EDIT: I want to add here that I also have mixed feelings writing these things.  We're writers.  We should get paid for writing.  That said, I now consider it more as a business proposal than anything else.  I'm a business.  I'm bidding on something (just like an architect or a contractor) and in all cases, you need to give the buyers a taste of what you're going to do before they spend any money.  And even if you don't write an actual document, you'll have to pitch something verbally anyway -- and my internal pitch document and my external treatment really aren't that different... so I'm doing the work anyway.   Might as well share.  Okay, I'm done procrastinating now. Back to the treatment I really don't want to write.  :)"

What he has is connections with financiers looking to develop a series that can help promote their city.

He asked me to develop a treatment that he can pass along and if the people holding the purse strings like it, he'll ask for a pilot."
Screenwriting,3axgse,slupo,2,Wed Jun 24 16:33:01 2015 UTC,"Ok so he's the producer and you're the writer for hire. An ideal contract would have:   Payment for your treatment Guarantees you get to write the first draft of the pilot and subsequent rewrites and payment for each when financing is secured Gives you EP credit for the series Gives you a spot on the writing staff for the series Cycle bumps if the series makes it to season 2+   For the first one, realistically you will not get paid for the treatment.  The second thing is the most important and realistic thing you can ask for. You want to write the pilot. You want the chance to make revisions You want to get paid. You want that writing credit.  You probably won't get EP or a writing spot for the entire series. (I mean guaranteed, if you prove yourself as valuable, you could stay on) You're probably hoping for one season of EP and writing staff. EP credit gives you a percentage of the EP fee (probably a small one like 5% or something) but that's still good because essentially it's free money. And then of course you'll be paid for being on the writing staff and you'll get a writing credit. These things are really important if you want a career.  Cycle bumps are really icing on the cake and probably not going to happen.  That's what I think anyway. good luck.  EDIT: And of course the obligatory, you need a lawyer to do all this shit"

""Anne, a middle age woman who is an old friend.""  the audience will have no way of knowing that unless they read the script. If it comes across through the dialogue, fine, but it doesn't need to be in the description.  Also how elderly is the teacher? It's not really plausible an elderly teacher who's had his job for that long is struggling with cocaine of all drugs. Maybe have it be a prescription addiction? Something more realistic. It just comes across as written by someone who knows nothing about cocaine, unless that is part of the absurdity of in and is part of the joke, then forget that.

The prod-co who does own the property won't want to read it, to avoid getting sued. (Furthermore, even if they did read it, it would be unlikely to interest them. You don't know what roads they've already explored and discarded. You don't know what sorts of instructions they would give a writer who was doing an assignment in that property.)  Be inspired by the stuff that you love, and write stuff that is like it. But do so with original characters, monsters, locations, situations, etc."

Sell it as a sequel to a knock-off franchise.  Under Siege 2 was written to be a Die Hard knock-off, and got changed to be a sequel to a different Die Hard knock-off.  Or this -- ""Simon Says"" was a a spec in the vein of Die hard which later became Die Hard 3.  I would not expect to write a spec Bond film and sell it as such"

Screenwriting,3avwh6,godspracticaljoke,7,Tue Jun 23 22:44:40 2015 UTC,"Plan your rewrite.   A feature is too much to hold in your head and just sort of wily-nily hack your way through.   So I would spend several days planning my approach, starting with an at-speed read-through (no breaks, not taking extensive notes).   Figure out the problems with your script. Figure out the goal of your rewrite. (You may only tackle one or two problems on a given rewrite). Make a detailed plan of action for accomplishing those goals.   Those three steps are done without working in your screenwriting software. They are notes, outlining, that kind of thing. The more detailed and precise, the better.   I mean, sometimes your problem is ""the third act sucks"" and your solution is ""come up with a whole new third act"" but usually - assuming you had a disciplined process for writing your first draft, and a solid outline to begin with - you can be more surgical than that.   Only once you've done all that, go in and implement the changes. And sometimes I'll do this three or four times as I try to take small steps, making sure I see how each set of changes impacts what I have."

Screenwriting,3avwh6,wrytagain,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:38:39 2015 UTC,"Well, following up on what I wrote before, I would say do it in several passes. Do a theme pass. (Diagnose, identify a treatment plan, implement). Do a pacing pass.   A dialog pass is probably the hardest because it's harder to just make a plan to ""improve"" that. But you might do a pass where you focus on one character, and just examine all of their scenes with the goal of making their dialog tighter. But, again, the more specific you can be about the problem, the better you'll be able to fix it: if your problem is a generic ""meh"" it's going to be really hard to come up with a clear solution.   But if that's as far as you can get, diagnostically, ""My dialog is sort of meh,"" then take step back and approach it like a student, NOT focused on this particular script. Do writing exercises that focus on dialog. Transcribe dialog from scenes you really love. That sort of thing. Raise your skill level, first ... and THEN do a pass where you simply rewrite everyone's dialog with your new, improved skills."

Screenwriting,3avwh6,floppylobster,2,Wed Jun 24 12:37:45 2015 UTC,"For my rewrites, I always focus on one thing at a time. I read it, in its entirety, with a red pen, and focus on story. What worked originally might not work now. I mark any scenes that need improving or just don't work. If I can read the script without a certain scene, then I'm pretty sure I can cut it. I also see if the sequences make sense.  Other rewrites focuses on the other elements. In my opinion, you can't change the characters without changing the story. So, if you realize that one of your main characters needs some major work, it'll affect the entire story (Or it should).  I do individual rewrites for dialogue and action.   When I'm finally through, I know I can combine everything and have a solid script. Rewriting this last draft, with the story changes, character work, new action and improved dialogue, starts with a brand new file. I don't copy and paste anything. It takes a while, but its worth it in the end.  Rewriting is my favorite."
Screenwriting,3avwh6,Likunandi,2,Wed Jun 24 08:16:31 2015 UTC,"I think the best advice I've ever received is ""Don't be precious."" I'm on my 4th, I'll say ""major"", rewrite of one project and that advice has helped me get rid of characters, do big switcheroos within the premise/backstory of one lead,  even change the title .. three times. (This pained me most, but I love the new title best, so.......) I've also tossed a BUNCH of scenes -- stuff I loved but, in the end, wasn't relevant enough to keep.  I'd received great notes on various drafts, from both pros and non-pros, and everything is helpful. Especially when you hear the same thing from several people!!! Hurts, but helps. If you're lucky enough to have readers who'll be honest with you, filter through their feedback and find the gems that you can put to work in your new draft.   While the main IDEA of my story hasn't altered, lots of other things have, but what I had to do was go back to the heart of my lead characters....... do the honest take on my intentions for them and each of their arcs, then hold that up against the drafts. When I did that, it forced rewriting and improvements -- because I was getting back to the core. The more true your characters are to who you've created them to be and how you've chosen them to alter/change/grow, the better their dialogue will be.  Good luck!!! I find rewriting fun and tortuous at the same time. And one thing I find interesting is........ with each new draft, I've already KEPT the best from the previous. So .... original and revision #2? They're in a pile, but I've not looked at them while working on #4."
Screenwriting,3avwh6,29Neibolt,2,Wed Jun 24 12:23:50 2015 UTC,"(1) Make your changes in chronological order. i.e. don't make a change in the middle. It will create ripples forward and back that will be very hard to get your head around.   (2) Following from that, mercilessly cut any scenes that now no longer make sense because of your changes. Keep them on a file somewhere and butcher the important parts to fit into other scenes.   (3) Don't be afraid of cutting anything. Everything can be put back in later in different places, be given to different characters and possibly into different screenplays in future.   (4) Be prepared to do a lot of rewrites if you want it to be good.   (5) At some point you might feel you have broken it and rewriting has made it worse.

David Trottier's Screenwriter's Bible is incredibly helpful for learning formatting and just the basics of 3 act/8 sequence structure. It's a good 'go to' when you're not sure how to write a sequence or format something off the top of your head.  Books I've enjoyed for their insight into screenwriting include Syd Field's Screenplay, and Blake Snyder's Save the Cat. They're not bibles, but read them and just take away what you want.   Chris Volger's The Writer's Journey is also good for learning archetypes.  But yes, also read scripts. Good screenwriters have unique voices that show up even in sparse scene description. I'd recommend reading some Shane Black, Cameron Crowe, and Tarantino scripts, just to see how they're written."

Good dialogue that conveys menace and the intent of your bad guys could be far more effective than showing something awful, especially if you are planning on showing a vicious attack on the protagonist soon after.   As for possible pacing issues, either write a little more build-up to the big event that ends Act 1 and sets the story in motion, or if you plan on having any sub-plots (police investigating or something of that nature) you could introduce them as well."

You could do a misdirect so the audience thinks the family being terrorized is the hero's family.  Then he arrives home to the horror and Shyamalan!  his family's fine!

They find out it's all lies and it's kind of a mystery as to if the money was ever there, if one of his friends took it, or if the commune is just covering up.

He heads back to Las Vegas to celebrate, only to run into Leonard again, running from the police. Leonard says Martin is his accomplice in the crime, so they both get arrested.

He's in a cult (cult is sinister, commune is pretty ""meh""), gets help escaping, is caught with a wad of cash with no good explanation for the FBI. Instead of sending him to prison or a psych ward, they want him to go back into the cult and gather as much intelligence as possible. Introduce [Antagonist Name], the cult leader.  So then act 2 is all about him finding out dirt on the cult. Maybe the cult is actually good, and he switches sides, with the FBI becoming the enemy. Or maybe the cult leader is planning a mass suicide or a terrorist attack, and he has to save the world himself because he gets cut off from contacting the FBI.  Act 3, he either proves the cult is great to the world, goes to jail and becomes a martyr, or ends up saving the world by foiling the cult leader's plan to kill people.

You can either play on that, by implying that this commune has influenced the police or psychiatric services and is thus framing him somehow, or you could just make his driving force to prove he isn't lying.   Everyone in life has been called a liar when they were telling the truth. Most people don't do anything about it maybe, but they understand the impulse to right that wrong.

Previously I had always thought ""premise"" was something simpler, like ""Jurassic Park with Norse monsters"" (Ragnarok) or ""an identical Earth appears in the sky"" (Another Earth). Something you can throw out really quick in a casual conversation. I think of the premise as being the soup stock, and then your protagonist, antagonist, stakes and theme being the meat and potatoes you throw in to make the stew.  What you have up there seems like more of a logline, and I think to keep people from getting confused, it might be best to refer to it as a logline with the ""drug addict goes to a commune"" being the premise.  I don't want to fight about it or anything, just trying to add to the discussion.  From what I've seen on Black List ratings (I browse a lot, not my own), the screenplays that get the most views/downloads tend to be the ones with the most unique premises.

I think if you have an interesting premise, it's not a matter of ""can you do something with it"", it's a matter of ""what are you going to do with it""? I'd like to think anything is possible, it's just a matter of pushing people to expose those possibilities.  For your confederacy story, maybe it's set in present day, and a white scientist falls in love with a black man (who's still a slave), so she produces an enzyme making skin lighter, and the rest of the story could explore society's reaction to both their relationship when they're found out, and what the enzyme does to disrupt the confederate America.  I'd hate to think any super awesome premise was dropped just because someone initially couldn't think of the protagonist, the stakes, or the antagonist. What might be more helpful is what sort of questions could be asked to unearth these nuggets. ""Who would have the most interesting goal in this sort of world?"" ""What sort of person would have an opposing goal?"" ""How can we put more on the line here?"""

Screenwriting,3av6ol,cubytes,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:40:00 2015 UTC,"I guess it's mostly semantics. I don't like the idea of a ""premise test"" because it feels like it's a pass or fail situation. I'd rather come at it from a more positive angle. My last screenwriter's meeting, we did ""log line work"" and was about ""polishing up our log lines"". People brought up problems, like the stakes not being high enough, and not having a clear antagonist, but I really feel everyone left with the idea they could improve their premise/logline and not need to abandon it.  But I really don't think we disagree with much. I mostly wanted to add to the discussion, not to disagree about any particular thing."

There was a lot of discussion about this when /u/cynicallad first posted what he was calling a ""logline.""  It's not about writing something to attract a reader.  It's about figuring out your story before you begin. Do you even have a story or just a premise?  Or an idea for a premise?   I found out I couldn't create a premise test example for the script I was writing and that's when I realized I had no idea which character was my protag. Or exactly what the stakes were."

I totally agree! I am just wondering what you much more experienced writers DO to help yourself figure things like this out. Like I always feel like there are some questions I should be asking myself where the answer would help guide the logic to my decision.  Chinatown is pretty linear in that regard, as we are never taken off from Jake's perspective of information and time. As a classic detective story style, we learn exactly what he learns, and exactly when he learns it. No more, no less, with no flashbacks. Mine is a two-hander drama that could include non-linearity of presenting information (flashbacks, etc.) instead of a one-handed straight mystery. I'm wondering how that changes things up."

I love musicals, grew up going to them, they're such a powerful way of storytelling, but, you're looking into a very niche market, a small money market, unless your name is Andrew Lloyd Webber or Matt and Trey. Even if the script is incredible, I'm sure many producers would have no idea what to do with it. From a money making point of view, a musical is a hard sell and that's even after having fifteen year long Broadway runs... I'm all for artistic integrity, but I think you may back yourself in a corner there. I'd assume it's a musical comedy like the Dracula thing from Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but even with great lyrics, so much hinges on the actors, composer, score, etc."

Screenwriting,3av7qd,gdavidso2,6,Tue Jun 23 19:44:11 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking I found it entertaining enough. My favorite part was the attack of the spaceship early on. The idea of the ship rebuilding as it's attacked is fascinating and cinematically intriguing. I think you should expand on this aspect.  While Sol's power makes sense given the nature of their bodies I don't really get how most of the other powers work. I don't feel like they are justified.  The religion/philosophy stuff is interesting but often feels forced, it feels like you are saying it not the character.  The last half of the story is pretty repetitive as they break into the dome 3 different times.   There is also a lack of tension in the action because the heroes are all super powered and most of the villains are generic guards.   It was good enough to keep reading but is not good enough to be a film yet.   Also you have 3 characters named after particles, probably a bit much.  You also have a lot of science jargon, which I enjoy because I'm a scientist but I think most people will be left confused by. Also the explanation of the organism living underground at the meteor needs more time, the whole sequence comes out of nowhere and feels rushed.    Below are notes I made while reading.  How did colbolt-60 become a new element, that was confusing.  You call someone a guard but I thought they were invaders.   This line could be better worded, specifically the last part. ""Sol, humans started their journey on Earth a long time ago here and life was good. However, overtime things began to get worse.""  Not a fan of the asimov reference. To me I, robot was a book about how the 3 laws didn't work. So I don't think it makes sense for your robots to use the laws. Also it  feels lazy.  ""someone could possible be"" should be possibly  ""It was them that committed mass killings when they wanted change. They have no empathy of dying."" The first sentence is strangely structured. The second sentence is not worded correctly.   ""Did you had a spell."" Should be have a spell?  ""Holli, I have to go to earth find it."" Not sure if you meant to put a to, or it needs a comma. Depending on your meaning.  ""She sees the is now looking at her with a cold stare"" missing the word boy.  ""She sees, out the corner of her eye to see a young girl"" Drop one of the see's  I like this line ""You have to believe in something, first, before you can be converted.""  ""It was only recently did we have the right to own private property."" This should be worded better.  So scientifically speaking if its a mix of iridium, colbalt and maya blue, it would be a compound or an alloy not an element.   ""They find the bearded Khalifa slowly smoking a cigar over the looking the city as the sun rises up on it."" Either lose the or looking  ""Khalifa! This is absurd. We have been atheist state since 1961."" Should be an atheist.  I find it hard to believe that Solari has never heard of the double split experiment.   ""Save your sermon for Sunday."" I like this line a lot.  ""He is corrupt with power."" This is a bad line, for many reasons.  The cloaking reveal is a bit convenient.   ""She reforms in front the guard."" Missing the word of  How does Solari hit the guard with so much force and knock him out? Isn't she a little girl.  ""They are sent down."" how about They descend.  ""Meson and Kehlani is effectively bending the light"" should be are  ""raising her arms high the air."" should be high in the air  ""Not so dumb is it?"" Groan, this line is real bad.   ""He's on a massacre through the hillside!"" I think there's a better way to say this, on a massacre sounds wrong.  ""Solari is mesmerized by the color looks back to see her exhaled bubbles catching in the large plants."" You need something between color and looks.   I don't see how Khalifa survives a car being thrown at him by cutting it.   ""Baryon picks up Shaiya flying off coming back picking up the vial."" This is bad grammar, i'm not really sure what is supposed to be happening.  I don't like how the characters immediately accept Sol's death. It seems unrealistic.  ""As we pull away showing LAN fills being constructed all over"" either drop the as or switch showing for we see."

For example:  She enters an open bay, filled with large glass paddocks and interstellar space.  Showcasing a spectacular event - the condensing of white matter.  That second sentence is a fragment, quite awkward, and completely distracting.  If I was curious about your story before - and I was - I've now completely forgotten about that curiosity and I'm just thinking about the grammar.  Fix this: either make it one clean sentence or add something like ""The bay is showcasing a spectacular event...""

Screenwriting,3avno7,_ivan,3,Tue Jun 23 21:36:31 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I usually roll my eyes at these meta type ideas about hollywood or wannabe filmmakers, but I read the script and have some thoughts.    The first two pages are unnecessary. If you want this to be that documentary style like the Office or Parks and Rec that's fine, but you don't need the main character telling us what they do and that they're making a documentary. We know they're a production company just by the nature of their work, and we can tell it's a documentary by the style and the fact the characters talk to the camera.  You don't need to capitalize names in dialogue. It looks like they're yelling.  ""Paul's face is blurred and his audio is distorted."" This is confusing. I think I'm missing the joke here, but either way, what audio is being distorted? Is Paul saying something? The scene where everyone introduces themselves goes on too long, and there aren't enough jokes to make it interesting. It could be better if we get to know them more naturally as they do their jobs.  The jokes aren't really working for me overall, and it's unclear what makes each character unique besides their position.   ""Riley is in his office telling us how he started the company."" Show, don't tell. You should actually write that dialogue.  So Riley goes from being a veteran hollywood director to a local TV news reporter? Is there any reason why he gives up hollywood? That seems like an important aspect of his character that you don't explore.  You spend seven pages on a flashback just to tell us that met Vicki at an art show. Is it really that important?  We don't need them explaining to the audience what broll is. You have a lot of scenes like this and they really slow the script down.  I think you need a more focused plot for your pilot. Right now it feels like a bunch of random scenes instead of a complete story."

Screenwriting,3augu6,poseymund,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:59:18 2015 UTC,"WHY is it a ""calling out,"" though?  Is he at the nurses station and she yells over to him?  Why? Never put anything in your screenplay unless you know what purpose it serves. You can put it in action, ""Nurse Betty yells over at Nameless."" Or let it go and allow actors and directors to do their part of the job.   You don't name a character in dialogue, you name a character when we meet them.  This guy is doing V.O., we're seeing him, he seems to be the protag, but he has no name."

Screenwriting,3awe92,ajanotaja,4,Wed Jun 24 01:13:27 2015 UTC,"If you're just starting out, the software nuances are the least of your problems.  If you're wanting traditional screenwriting software, Fade In is great value for the price. It has a free trial. I haven't tried WriterDuet Pro, but you can try out the basic version (online only, Pro is stand-alone) for free. In fact, the free version may be all you need at the moment. Speaking for myself, I don't like writing in online-only environments. It tends to distract me. Again, WriterDuet Pro is stand-alone, it's only the free version that's online only.  There's also Trelby, which is entirely free. That could easily get you started.  If you're wanting something that's more built for outlining, Scrivener is really good and has a free trial. It is built around a very robust corkboard/index card model. It isn't only for screenwriting, but it has screenwriting formatting as an option. It's a pretty steep learning curve before it all clicks in, though.  As for Final Draft, again if you're just starting out I don't see a huge reason to pay $200+ for it when there are cheaper and very similar alternatives out there.  You may also want to investigate Fountain. It isn't software, but rather a way of writing text files so apps can turn them into formatted screenplays. You'll see a list of apps that do this on the Fountain site (including, among others Fade In, WriterDuet, Scrivener and Trelby. Final Draft doesn't natively talk Fountain.)"

Screenwriting,3avjxi,cubytes,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:09:27 2015 UTC,"Hey, man, I commented on your last post regarding this idea, glad to see you are still working on it, and you have a lot more information here than on your last post. With that said, your plot beats and character arcs are all over the place.  You describe this as a contemporary V For Vendetta. V had a ideology, a goal, a manifesto to live by. One of the best lines in both the film and graphic novel is, ""Do you know the great thing about ideas? They're bulletproof."" So what idea do you twins represent. Raging against the machine is an extremely broad term. It worked for the band because every song could be about something different; a movie has to be focused. You need to really develop what exactly these genetic super-human twins are going to standing up against. The reason V For Vendetta is a powerful story is because V is standing for something (Anarchy, in the book at least). You might have a bunch of cool set-pieces planned out, but that all just becomes noise if the reason for the carnage is not valid. This is why Terminator 2 is head and shoulders above any other action movie ever made.   You describe it as a ""monster in the house"" type of story, but the house in question is going to be Manhattan? Not trying to talk down to you, brother, but have you been to Manhattan?? It is enormous. Concrete jungle is an understatement. Monster in the house type stories work because the protagonists are trapped in a confined area with something that vastly superior to them in some way or even multiple ways. The tension comes from how confined the protagonist is, and the inevitable run in with the big bad monster. I mentioned this somewhat in my previous comment for this, and I maintain that I think this concept would work stronger (and be more marketable) in a confined setting, possibly the genetic research facility you mention in your plot beats. See the original Alien for an excellent example of what you call a ""monster in the house"" film. The characters are trapped on a spaceship with an apex predator; they cannot run away, because they are in, you know, freaking space! That is ingenious. You have to figure out how to confine your characters to the house in those types of stories. Another good, and unorthodox, example of that type of film is Buried starring Ryan Reynolds. The ""monster"" of that situation is time/nature.  From the story beats you provided, it seems as though the twins are going to be in the genetic facility, like prisoners, no? Well, how in the hell would they plan this crazy elaborate attack, and where would they get the explosives to destroy the bridges, and how would they get every bridge lined with explosives, detonate them all at once, without being in a prolonged gunfight for that entire duration with police and or the security forces of the cloning organization? Does that not seem like credibility being stretched to the extreme?  And guns! In New York City? One of the hardest places to get firearms in the US! If you know some people that know some people, you could get something, sure. But your soldier character is not going to be getting an AK-47 or anything like that at a pawn shop, or anywhere in the city for that matter. If you have to go with that plot point, I think it is more logical for the cop to raid the police armory or something, given the setting you have chosen here.  As a veteran, your reason for the soldier being dishonorably discharged (stated in your response to another poster above) is ridiculous. Liberal political views are accepted in the military. It would be a lot more believable if he were medically discharged due to a wound, or you expand upon his disillusionment with the war he was fighting. Have him suffer from PTSD and try to cope with it through substance abuse. He pops hot on a piss test, then he gets discharged. That is a very tangible and accurate reality that soldiers face every day, and is more dramatically charged than ""liberal political views,"" which just sounds like you wanted a former soldier but could not come up with a good background for him. Also, as a vet, I rolled my eyes when you said he returns from a deployment home, discharged! The military does not work that fast, man! They drag their feet and seemingly try to be as ineffective as possible. It takes months upon months to exit military service, even under a dishonorable discharge. There are a lot of hoops one must jump through before they go back to civilian life. There is also a lengthy reintegration process after a soldier returns from a deployment, so you positioning him as coming back from a war zone, getting discharged, and then just showing up at the wife's house is a little ridiculous. The average audience member will not notice a detail like this, but the difference between a good writer and a bad one is seeking out details like that, that way the one guy in the theater who does know how ridiculous that is does not tell all his friends about how ridiculous it is, which then ruins the immersion for the friends.  You could turn this into something producers would be interested in, but I think it needs a lot of revising, even in these infant stages. You said above ""This same scenario was used in one of the Batman movies. If it worked in that movie I should be able to make it work in this one."" Bane's plot in The Dark Knight Rises is the weakest part of that entire movie! It did not work in that film, and if the Nolan brothers could not sell something like that,  I do not think you should try on a first script. Just being honest.  Continue to post updates about this, I am curios as to how you continue to develop it."
Screenwriting,3avjxi,NeoNoireWerewolf,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:45:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback.   I think you saved my ass on this one. I was on cloud-nine ""reaching for something new"" type procrastination until I read your reply.   Now all kinds of wheels are turning...    Not only did you share great ideas on how to make the soldiers scenario more grounded. You also challenged me to really really think long and hard about the set up I am going for.   Naturally I am still going for it, but I am more cognizant of the challenge that entails. Made some tweaks.    Unfortunately I am a bit sleep deprived and completely exhausted from work. I just accidentally backspaced out of a huge follow up comment and was moments away from posting it actually. A page long one. Which elaborated (or rather ""spilled the whole guts"" of) how I was going to approach pulling off this set up.   Suffice it to say I don't feel like typing all of it again at this moment. When I have more energy I will elaborate more.   I will take the time to admit (re-admit) that I love your feedback regarding the soldiers scenario and backstory. I am going to run with those ideas, let them percolate and most likely weave them in.   I honestly didn't put much thought into the backstory of the soldier. I know what the characters role in the story is but who he is was a mystery. And in hindsight it was a bit of a stretch to think that his ""liberal views"" alone would get him discharged. Though I was thinking more along the lines of him blatantly refusing to take orders on some moral principal that reinforced his liberal views. But making him more edgy might pay off even more. Since technically he is the harbinger of justice in the monster in the house story. The one who will kill the character responsible for the twins creation on a whim from a dark selfless devil may care state of mind. But his story will end in a tragic outcome.   Also another key takeaway: The twins have supporters, that borderline worship them. An inside man, and an outside force. This is meant to streamline the timeline of the initial set up. Allowing them to patiently wait in the secure facility pretending to be trapped. The alternative would be they escape and it takes them years of planning and executing to set up the whole thing up.    Honestly I still have a lot to learn when it comes to story structure.  Oh and a bit about what the twins stand for.   It will be hard to top V for Vendetta, in fact I am not even going to try. They are not dishing out tough love. Instead I am going to make them look upon humans as inferior ants that need to be taught a lesson about the consequences of playing with genetics, the consequences of playing god and creating a new apex predator.   And to do that they are going to ""stomp on the anthill"" of society, make the ants scurry about in chaos, not for some higher purpose but out of sheer hatred. All of which riffs off the genre of ""monster in the house"" since they were born/created out of greed/corruption to begin with....  Again thanks for the feedback.   Much Appreciated"
Screenwriting,3avjxi,ElPlywood,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:18:06 2015 UTC,"Your logline makes it wound like the twins are holding the cop and the soldier hostage, as in tied up in a room. If New York City is just booby trapped, then what's the big deal? If the twins are such geniuses, then how hard could it be for them to just track down the businessman and kill him? Why would they need to blow up all the bridges out of Manhattan? COuldn't people just escape by going north? How old are the twins? What is the soldier's goal? The cop's? If the soldiers was dishonourably discharged, then why would we be on his side?"
Screenwriting,3aubw7,bad_new,2,Tue Jun 23 16:00:36 2015 UTC,"I read the cold open only.   Evey is already somebody I don't particularly want to spend time with. She isn't demonstrating a unique point of view. She isn't funny.  Her response to a mildly annoying customer is obnoxious in the extreme, not in a funny way (at least, not particularly on her part).   She just comes off as a generally negative person. Remember that a big part of a sitcom is that these are people who I want to spend time with, to invite into my living room week after week.   Now maybe that's because they're uproariously funny, or particularly observant, or maybe it's because I just like them. But none of those apply to Evey here.   If you want to make this work, you need to make her day on the job really really awful. Like comically bad. Not just two mildly annoying customers who happen to be fat. (Seriously - this is not that bad as customers go). And then you need to put her in charge of the response - handing it off to someone else to jizz in the food makes her weird passive-aggressive, and that's an extremely unattractive quality that you're going to have to work much harder to find humor in.   A cold open like this has to get me onboard to want to see more of the characters, because, honestly, I can flip the channel and I haven't missed anything important on any other show. I would do that here."
Screenwriting,3aubw7,HotspurJr,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:13:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's a love-to-hate character? OP? EDIT: Btw, I agree with you completely."
Screenwriting,3aubw7,zombdi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:16:55 2015 UTC,"So I do see this and may adjust, but the cold open is supposed to be more a shocker and not something I fully intended on the viewer empathizing with or deeming justifiable. I kind of wanted a little bit of ""what made this chick so bitter"". And Evey is negative but thats addressed and takes a turn in the second act. I would not want to write a sarcastic, douchey, passive-aggresive character. A ""love- to -hate"" I personally am tired of those. I think if you finish the episode, you will see I try to make Evey human, in that she is flawed and knows she is and wants to be better, slowly trying to be better. The series (hypothetically) will explore her past as she lives it. And then come back in snippets to the ""future"" her.  But yes in terms of the cold open I could have written worse customers and I fully intended on showing more of the atrocities that the fast food service has to show in terms of customers treating workers like shit. Again I wanted this to be the extreme. But its all bologna if the viewer is gonna flip the channel! I don't want that haha. I may adjust, but I would hope you finish the episode and maybe change see if you opinion changes. Thanks!"
Screenwriting,3aubw7,HotspurJr,3,Tue Jun 23 17:49:59 2015 UTC,"Well, here's the problem:   So I do see this and may adjust, but the cold open is supposed to be more a shocker and not something I fully intended on the viewer empathizing with or deeming justifiable.   It doesn't matter if it makes sense later if I don't stick around to get to the later. This is a pilot. This is television. Something else is just a flick of my thumb away.   You have to been empathy first. And you can build empathy with an unlikeable character, but it's extremely difficult with a petty and passive-aggressive one.   Your opening has to get me connected to your lead, and show me some aspect of her that I want to stick around and watch more of. So you want to find a way to give me a flavor of the coming humor - and right now, you're telling me in this open that the humor in this is going to be on the level of jizz-in-food and making fun of fat people.   And I'm just not interested in that.   ""It'll make sense if you keep reading,"" is a dubious justification in features, where you can sometimes get away with it. It's death in television. The first couple of pages in a comedy pilot absolutely, positively have to give me a sense of what the show is, and if it's a somewhat premise-y pilot, like this, then you really have to make sure you're doing that with tone and humor."
Screenwriting,3aubw7,BAIIPlus,2,Tue Jun 23 18:11:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your critique. I guess it's something I have to think about in terms of immediate gratification for the viewer and them ""connecting"" within the first 1-2 minutes of screentime. I will definitely adjust. That being said, the tone of the rest of the episode is not as extreme of raunchy as the cold open, again I kinda wanted a shocker, more than a laugh. I would hope you would read at least the first act and maybe see if the cold open isn't necessary. The rest of the episode does work without it. It just changes the tone a bit. Again thank you for reading, I would be extra thankful if you read some more."
Screenwriting,3aubw7,BAIIPlus,2,Tue Jun 23 20:59:26 2015 UTC,"I finished it.  It had a lot of great gags, but as a whole could use work. I'll start off listing things I liked:   *Evey's relationship with her room mate  *Shiiiiii-  *Evey deciding to order pancakes after seeing they are the only item  *Stoner bro God  *Stoner bro God asking Patricia how her kids are and her response  *Evey's life as a DVD  *Using God for exposition.  Who better to give a summary of the main plot than God?  *-iiiiit  *The dramatic slo-mo replay of Evey throwing the banana peel  *Tabitha  *Evey going through all the bad things she did that day and getting in trouble for dress code violation.  Genius.  The entire first act was pretty weak compared to the rest.  I suffer from this too so no worries.  But as someone else pointed out, the Cold Open just wasn't funny enough and Evey just wasn't likeable in it.  It needs to be reworked.  The phone call with her mom didn't seem to go anywhere so you can probably cut it all together.  I thought you were going to explore their relationship more during the car ride, but since you didn't... yeah, cut it.  The Mormon minister scene needs to be punched up with jokes.  Are you sure you want her returning a scarf to be what causes her death?  I feel like you can tie her death into something else that really shows how deep of a low point she's in by the time she dies.  The second act was probably the best in my opinion.  A lot of great jokes, and a commendably short time for your main exposition.  I don't think you need to linger with God and the iHop staff too long after Evey gets sent back to 2008.  Just have God pet the cat, then make the cut.  I think you should write a different ending joke for that act too.  There was no reason to show the iHop staff again (unless you plan on them becoming running characters?) and that joke of implied eating of cats isn't that strong.  You've gotta end your acts on your strongest jokes.  Your school stuff was fine by and large, but you need need need to show why this time in her life is when she peaked.  Just showing her having a shitty day at high school doesn't fit with the theme of peaking.  You need to show why her life was great there.  Show how popular her high school self was and have the conflict come from the fact that she's grown out of that identity.    Her meeting up with an old best friend was sweet.  But you should add a bunch of people fawning over her for superficial vapid reasons throughout the day.  Like, what if one of the bullies she beat up actually knew her, and when she showed up he increased his bullying because he thought it would impress her?  Her high school self should be someone cool and popular that her current self hates.  Her reconciling those two aspects of herself is where the meat of her arc should come from.  That can be personified by her befriending Tabitha, who can represent someone she'd hang out with at 22, and remaining friends with Abby, her old best friend, and having them hate each other, but learning to get along.  The ending for the third act could also probably have been stronger.  Maybe show God one more time toward the end.    As a whole I think you need some work ending acts and generally leaving scenes earlier.  The first act needs the most brushing up, and the third act needs to highlight the peak aspect more.    A side comment: I liked her interactions with her room mate a lot.  I hope you feature a younger version of her as a guest character at some point."
Screenwriting,3aubw7,BAIIPlus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:13:19 2015 UTC,"WOW so helpful and so correct on all points. After spending some time away from it and revisiting the screenplay I absolutely see all of this. Yes I definitely questioned the phonecall because I wanted it as a little bit of exposition, but being so early in the episode I thought it would seem forced. So I made it too vague. I wanted a glimpse into some sort of problem that needed forgiving (eventually her mean and controlling father). I should've revisited in the car, great idea!  I questioned the missionary scene and yes my first act is weak and devoid of jokes :( I thought maybe her dying for something so silly and random was kind of darkly funny, but also showing her actually being nicer than she seems. Slamming the door on them and being kind of rude, but actually being considerate enough to give the scarf back.  It all needs spicing up and reworking.  Here is a problem for me that I don't know what to do. In terms of her peak, one of the things I was going for, and that I allude to, was that she did not have a great time in high school. And so things have even gone more downhill for her. I never imagined her as popular, but yes more superficial. She was always trying to get on a higher social rung, but was still kind kind of an outcast. Just had one or two friends and wasn't special in school or anything. Old Evey was insecure and cared too much about the drama and social structure of school. Evey now doesn't care about much, and knows this is a problem and will try to improve. This is what I was going for. BUT I just felt like there wasnt much time translate this to the screen and have plot for the episode. The ""Peaked"" was to be ironic. BUUUUt I'm going to restructure and take into account what you're saying. I definitely like the idea of the contrast of Tabitha and Abby as representative of her now and then, I was going for that a little bit. I don't know, should I make her popular in school? And have her come back and ignore all of the popularity? What's your opinion?  Yes yes I need to work on my acts and the jokes. This is the first thing I've written and I'm still working on structure. I'm trying to find that balance of having a plot, jokes, but keeping it moving with action.  A loose structure of the timelines/dimensions the show would explore would be:   Evey before she died, as a depressed, negative fast food worker. With the roommate and co-workers and such. the main ""dimension"" of her as a teen the second time. flash backs to her as a teen the first time, leading up to how she became blonde dropout Evey. And then I'm not sure how much, but God's storyline. Him interacting with other ppl in heaven. Was thinking of Evey having check ups with him once in a while back in the IHOP.   Thoughts?   You have been so helpful, and have very good criticisms. I very much appreciate you taking your time to read and help me. I hope you'll read my next draft. Thanks sincerely!"
Screenwriting,3aubw7,zombdi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:58:19 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely read your next draft.  I enjoyed this one a lot.  The premise is creative enough to set it apart, but not so out there that it's too niche.  I think you're right, maybe Evey doesn't need to be outright popular.  But you do need to figure out how to show how fundamentally different she was when she was in high school.  Having flashbacks will be a good tool, but nailing down the character of old high school Evey will be key to making the story work.  She has to be very different and at the very least, noticeably happier.  I like the idea of young Evey being insecure and caring too much.  See how far you can take that in terms of giving her a different personality from her current one.  You can try writing her as popular and see if that still fits the tone you want.  Depending on how unnatural that feels, you can keep adjusting from there.  For the missionary scene, I think I get what you're going for now.  But I can't actually picture apathetic Evey going out into the cold to return the scarf based on what we saw so far.  I know that this was supposed to highlight a new trait, but it was a little jarring.  What if instead of missionaries they were like Girl Scouts or something?  Like they're selling cookies but ask to come in because they need a break from the cold?  I think you could derive a lot of humor from innocent hopeful young girls contrasted against the bitter, cynical Evey.  You can highlight her beliefs and give some exposition if you have her give a ""This is why the world sucks"" monologue to the girls.  And then you can get a lot of humor from their reactions.  I think it will be more believable for Evey to return something to the Girl Scouts after a scene like this because you'll be able to show how and why she might have a soft spot for them (they remind her of a more hopeful time in her life).  Having her check in with God every now and then sounds fun.  You'll need some sort of story device for this to work.  Like the way God answers prayers like they're phone calls, you'll need to figure out what gets her back into iHop.  Is it something as simple (lame) as her going there while she's dreaming?  Maybe she can only get there when she's close to death (depending on how dark you want to go).    How do you plan on exploring more of her fast food life?  Because that also has potential.    I meant to mention this last time, but I think you should probably reel back some of the R-rated stuff and keep it a solid PG-13 level show.  Having Enrique jizz onto the fat people's food sticks out as being much more adult than the rest of the show, and as that other person stated, that scene didn't work that well anyway.  I think you can just have her give laxatives to someone for some reason.  It will make the second time she does it in the episode even funnier if it's made clear that this is a forte of hers that she picked up working in fast food.  Feel free to PM me your second draft whenever it's ready.  I'm happy to keep discussing the first one with you on here as well.  If I send you a draft of a pilot I'm working on will you take a look at it for me and send me some notes too?"
Screenwriting,3aubw7,zombdi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:59:34 2015 UTC,"I'm revising now, you have been so helpful!   I'm working with the missionaries a little more to show them as possible closeted homosexuals so that maybe it makes more sense for Evey to show some compassion for them. I do like your girl scout idea, though. See what you think of this next draft (thank you for agreeing to read it when it's done!) and maybe I will ditch the missionaries if it doesn't seem to work.   And also yes, I'm trying to do more with how she dies in the context of hitting a low and her depraved situation. I am trying to build a little empathy for her character, but it seems so unnatural to me in the context of just stating it in conversation. Maybe I will include a short flashback. There is plenty of that in the second episode though, so I will see. I really don't want her to come off as a mean person. Just a tad bitter, but still a nice human.  I have definitely re-vamped the cold open. That humor was just too R-rated and raunchy right off the bat I agree with you and the other commenters.  As for the rules of the meet-ups with God, affecting the timeline, rules of the universe types of things, I establish it more in the second episode, which I  already have a very rough draft of. (I couldn't help myself, I honestly am enjoying this concept so much I will write episodes even if no one will ever see them.)   I would love to read your draft! And definitely I will add notes. It might take me a bit more time to make sure they are up to the caliber you have provided me, but I will try! This is the first thing I've really written in terms of television and screenplays, but I've watched a lot of this t.v. and try and learn from the sub."

(I haven't seen it)  I think it's cool that you've written a second episode as well.  I think the hardest part of writing screenplays is just writing the screenplays.  Thanks for agreeing to look at my draft!  I'll probably try to PM it to you some time this weekend.  Maybe a little earlier if I have time to brush it up tonight.    Your screenplay is really solid for not having taken professional classes or anything like that.  I think you have a good sense for comedic timing."
Screenwriting,3aubw7,zombdi,0,Thu Jun 25 18:36:17 2015 UTC,"So disclaimer is that I've never written a screenplay/I'm writing my first one now (I'd love feedback!). This is just what I think I know.      I've heard that you don't need to write black screen, because if there's nothing written yet, it would be a black screen.    Just my personal preference, would you like something other than ""bleached to shit""? Maybe overly-bleached? Again, that's just me.    I don't think you need a CONT'D unless it continues to the next page. Also, I don't think you need the word cue. Also, I don't think ""bitchily"" is a word, but I understand what you're going for. Last thing, I don't think you need to mark where you end scenes, like ""END OF COLD OPEN""      Okay, so onto the story:    I've read up to the end of Act One, I'll read more if you really really want me to. So far I really like the characters. I really get a sense of the post-college/mid-twenties roomate/fast food working youngsters. As for the story, I like the set up. And it doesn't seem too religious to me, if not completely irreligious so far. Could you just tell me this (or make me read your script lol) what is Evey's plan after she goes back to her ""peak""? Just to redo her life? Maybe you could set up (you might've already) more fuck ups in her past? Also, you could have a set goal for her maybe to return to her normal life, or to have her life a certain way? I might add more, but that's what I have so far. And again, I've never written a screenplay, I'm writing my first one now, so take all this with a grain of salt."

At lot of it is just more for the exercise, the actual motion of my fingers on the keyboard, than anything else.   It's like running or any other sort of physical activity. The more you do it, the easier it gets and you begin to form good habits. The less you do it, the harder it is to pick up again. Practice good habits, that's the end game.

Screenwriting,3asmcz,2drums1cymbal,4,Tue Jun 23 06:30:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly. So I'll watch my favorite shows and write it out like I would if I was writing a spec for them. I try to be as concise as possible with the action, leaving in only the most crucial points and sticking to the ""1 minute=1 page"" rule (though that can be flexible for dialogue-heavy sitcoms).  It's really fucking tedious but it also incredibly helpful in breaking down structure, act breaks and distinct character voices. It also gives me a ton of respect for my favorite shows and writers. The last show I did this with was ""The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"" and I was astonished at not only the volume of jokes in the dialogue but also how everything every character says drives the plot forward. Totally made me rethink how I do dialogue in my original work and improved it immensely."

I always thought writing as a long process starting with experiencing life in various ways that we'll unknowingly and eventually use in our scripts, through to the inspirational moment when we realize the idea, to drafting an outline (or skipping this part if you don't outline), and then writing the script.  I've read too many scripts where I know the writer hasn't experienced what they've written because if they had, it wouldn't have been stereotypes, cliches, or just not true.  Take Mike Judge for example, he went out to Silicon Valley to learn the culture there for the HBO show, and I think he sent his writers to Texas to do the same for King of the Hill.  The point being is that it's not always necessary to focus on writing everyday as much as you should focus on experiencing and living everyday because that's where every screenplay comes from."

Practicing is the only way to improve your skill. Your practice does not even have to be a screenplay.  Sometimes I write scenes I do not intend to put in the final product in order to know my characters better.
Screenwriting,3asmcz,maxis2k,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:50:29 2015 UTC,"Every day. Yes.   Writing means time dedicated to thinking about projects. Not sitting at your computer reading Facebook or r/screenwriting. You don't actually have to be producing pages, but you need that dedicated time."
Screenwriting,3asmcz,dpergs4,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:15:16 2015 UTC,"If you still don't have a fully developed idea, you can literally just open a program like Word or Scriviner and start spit-balling concepts.  Write vague outlines with the few key points you do have.  Then add more points connected to the few you already wrote.  Then add more on top of that.  Etc.  It produces a snowball effect that helps you develop the idea itself as well at the confidence to move onto the actual first draft write up.  I'd say half my writing is done in these kinds of outlines, not the actual rough or final drafts.  Also, I think the term 'write every day' is kind of poorly worded, making people think that its a chore that has to be done.  But writing is a creative process that some days, you just won't be able to do.  You may be tired, sick or distracted by some friends.  You shouldn't just drop everything in your life and force yourself to write 4 hours a day.  At least not at the start.  Filling a quota isn't going to help your desire and creative process at all.  I think the saying should be amended.  'Write when you can and eventually the desire to write will grow in you'."
Screenwriting,3asmcz,HenryChinaskiForPrez,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:18:22 2015 UTC,"Writing is not necessarily sitting at your computer tapping keys all day. For the most part, it's quite the opposite.  Some of the most integral parts of writing, IMO, are those hours you spend staring at your computer, thinking and brainstorming. This happens to absolutely everyone. There really is no escaping it.  I think when writers take this as a discouraging sign, they end up closing up shop for the day. Maybe they'll revisit the script in a few hours, days, weeks, who knows. The point is, the time you spend mapping out your script and thinking of new ideas is not wasted time.   So every time you find yourself blankly staring at your computer, just remember that this is a crucial part of the writing process. It can drive you insane, sure, but it can also be exhilarating when you break down some of those walls or finally work out a scene you've been struggling with.   In the end, no matter what your process is, you're going to have to take some time out to think of ideas and/or fix existing ones. There's no point in trying to avoid it."

Screenwriting,3arh1f,Grachamoncha,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:30:15 2015 UTC,"Not bad; certainly better than a lot of stuff posted on here. I am definitely intrigued by this, as I had never heard of the Sodder Family and their situation. I just googled them and read a summary of the mystery, and it could definitely make for one hell of a compelling film.  There are some grammatical issues in there, but they are all small ones. Do some more revising and make sure you get amateur hiccups like confusing ""to"" and ""too"" out of the script.   I also think you should rework the voice over by Blackwood; having him state the exact time throughout the opening is kind of pointless. You can convey the passage of time with scene transitions. Knowing the exact time of everything happening is cool for people that revel in details, but it is extraneous from a story telling perspective. Blackwood's long exposition dump at the end of this sample should be reworked, too. I think the situation with the family is a mine for drama, and you could convey a lot through their POV before swapping over to Blackwood and his investigation in 1968.  Finally, I think you need more transitions, particularly at the end when you jump from the fire, to Blackwood's voiceover, to later when the house has been burned down, without any headers indicating a passage of time. More headers during the sequence where the family is trying to save the trapped children would help the action flow better, as well."

As a reader, I would appreciate more hints here and there that firmly place the scene in the `40's (if I recall.)  Sometimes your phrasing is awkward enough that I wondered if English was your second language. If you haven't finished the script yet, it's more important to power through to the end.

Screenwriting,3aso86,JakeFromDaStateFarm,3,Tue Jun 23 04:51:18 2015 UTC,"Hey dude, don't know too much about screenwriting but I recently binged on all six seasons of Community with my girlfriend so here's my feedback.  First of all: props for finishing it. That might sound like a backhanded compliment but the truth is that most people (such as myself) don't even get that far. So feel good about that. It's also much easier for people on here to critique somebody else's starting point and expose their weaknesses than it is to make something and expose your own, which is what you've managed to do. My suggestion is to just keep writing and take all criticism as constructive. Now, here's my 'constructive criticism'.  What stuck out to me the most about your script was the 'Season 4' feel to it. If you're a fan of the show and know about how Dan Harmon's departure from and return to the show affected Community, particularly in season 4, then you'll know what I mean. The characters you've written, to me, feel more like copies of the characters outward traits on the show. This was one of the big problems with season 4 - the characters we came to know and love and most importantly, empathise with, became sources of catchphrases, one-liners and obvious setup-punches. I think it's important to keep a sitcom light and packed with jokes, but what's more important is character motivation. That seems to be the difference between having an audience simultaneously captivated by the show and comforted by it's formula, and solely the latter. Not sure if you're familiar with Dan Harmon's story circles, but it's an excellent source for figuring out how story structure works and is also a template for character motivation.  Getting more specific now. Character motivation also effects jokes, since the comedic situation is built on a character's motivation to begin with. So it's so important that the audience doesn't detach emotionally from what that character is doing. I think this happens most evidently for me with Abed, Annie and Shirley. I think you get the surface value of Abed in your script in that he introduces wacky, exciting elements to the story, but I think you missed his motivations entirely. Abed is detached from reality, but ultimately values his friends above all else, and by season 5 has learnt how his excursions into fantasy impact his friends and I can't see him teaming up with Chang and doing what he does in your script. Also, I don't think I at all understand what sparked this need to talk with Matt Damon and cause all of this (maybe I missed something). Annie is, for the most part, a very rational/practical character, so the fact that she's helping Abed and Chang makes no sense to me. She may be naive or irrational at times when it comes to competitiveness and she can also be empathetic, but her motivations in your script are too thin in my opinion. Couldn't make the mental/emotional jump. Lastly, there's Shirley and how she was portrayed in your script which I'll discuss next.  The jokes. Good job on the timing and having a good balance of characters reacting in any given situation. I also think you more-or-less got Chang right. However, I felt that many of the jokes were quite off. This script focused on Abed, Chang and Annie for the most part. The rest of the characters were secondary, which isn't a huge issue. There is one very big, unavoidable issue to me here though... Let's look at Shirley. You know know her character from the show, but I felt you focused much less on her personality traits and more on her superficial ones. Namely, the fact that she's black. That stood out an uncomfortable amount to me. Although they do allude to her race in the show, they only use race minimally and when they do, it's either a subtle tongue-in-cheek joke, often commenting on cultural sensitivities, or satirising racism through the lens of the bigoted Pierce. Here you outright define her character by her race, which she uses to guilt Chang when she alludes to slavery which is, whether you intended it or not, very inappropriate. You also used Chang to associate black people and prison quite matter-of-factly in the opening of the episode which felt quite cringey. Please don't take this as hypersensitivity on my part. I know how people can perceive things when it comes to being PC but I personally love humour that brings controversial subjects to the forefront, but there is no commentary in the black jokes in your script which warrant their existence.  That were the main points for me. Overall, a good effort (despite what it might seem by my feedback). Just keep writing and using the opportunity to improve if screenwriting is your passion."
Screenwriting,3aso86,writersglock,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:18:34 2015 UTC,"Appreciate that you read through the entire script. I wrote this at the time when the show was cancelled after the fifth season.  I see what you mean about the race jokes being one-sided and that wasn't my intention. Thinking about it now, I realize there were never any comebacks because Troy wasn't there, and Shirley's character is my least favorite, which is why I didn't involve her more. I like to push the boundary somewhat for folks to think about touchy subjects.  From reading the critiques, I'm realizing I didn't portray this being about Chang dreaming well enough. I tried to get that point across in the last scene, which tied all the craziness together.  Appreciate the feedback, cheers."

Main concern is that it recycles a lot of Community; so much of it and in the wrong way that it's over-the-top ""Community"" to be generous, though I would better describe this as a parody. It was an earnest attempt but it struggles to be faithful to the spirit of the show - reason why fanfic is so (ponders) poor.  It really transpires with the character's idiosyncrasies. They're not there by a WIDE margin. I would've been surprised as only Harmon and his crew know how to write these characters to resemble real, credible people. Your characters read more like mere caricatures and visibly so, outside of Chang though that's because his character is an absurd, self-indulgent caricature and they're easier to write than most think. Dean's treatment was the most wasteful; you atrociously butchered the most layered character that's ever been on the show. Dean, who gave us the peanut bar costumed rap from S05 (imo the single most memorable moment from the entire series) deserved better."

I like the sites because a page can be two or three columns. Really useful if you want to have dialogue with flashbacks and dialogue within flashbacks, or cut back and forth from location to location. I like Blogger because it's very simple to use and you can also have columns of info, boxes of links. Both can have images that represent the script's world. Research pages, links to tools.

Screenwriting,3aqmz0,writetheysaid,5,Mon Jun 22 18:44:59 2015 UTC,"Like most things in writing, this is a pretty broad answer and not always true. But I'll give you my take.   First, there's the natural difference between TV and films. Movies are often an extraordinary day in the life of an ordinary person. TV is often an ordinary day in the life of extraordinary people. This comes through in their approaches to comedy. Sitcoms squeeze more comedy out from their characters (the extraordinary people) and films from their situations (the extraordinary ""day"").  With sitcoms, the more episodes you spend with a character, the funnier their idiosyncrasies become. If you can remember back to watching your first episode of The Office, I'm guessing the show got funnier for you as it went along. It's about the repertoire of the characters and how their interactions evolve over time. Things become funnier when you really ""get"" a character's crazy personality, and one film isn't enough time to do that for every main and supporting character. Sitcoms rely on their characters so much for comedy, they usually end up dying out because everyone becomes caricatures of their former selves. Compare: the last season of FRIENDS to the original. But if you're doing a sitcom right, any two characters walking into a room and talking, dialogue only, will be entertaining.   In film, that scene may feel like a waste of time. First, you have to keep moving the plot along in film. That's why you see a lot more comedy set-pieces in that medium (though they happen in TV) that intertwine big plot moments with big laughs. Because just like a big expensive chase scene from an action film, comedy films often have their BIG moments that are too grand, too defining to the plot/character to be used in TV. Plus, add in the fact a lot of comedy films have a high concept hook, like Jim Carrey is now God, and they want to mine that premise for jokes way more so than mining all the film's characters for jokes. Just think: ""How can I make this premise funny in many ways?""  I'd also like to say TV is often more topical and movies timeless, but there are a lot of pop culture references in comedy movies nowadays. Wish that wasn't the case, though. TV you can make jokes about something that literally happened a week or two ago, and it's great. When a film writes in that same joke, it's old news two years later when it comes out."

Screenwriting,3aqmz0,Schroef,-1,Mon Jun 22 19:13:53 2015 UTC,Yep. I'm particularly interested in the difference in where the comedy comes from...in sitcoms it's very reliant on character but this doesn't seem to be as big a deal in comedy movies.
Screenwriting,3aqmz0,poseymund,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:40:21 2015 UTC,"Sitcoms eat jokes, watch two broke girls, their writers must be exhausted by a Friday.  Features are different as they require plot, character arcs, cat saving, as well as having to cram the laughs in."

I've been investigating it with the server hosts for the past few days - we've added a catch-all that is supposed to at least restart the server if this happens but... ding ding ding... they screwed that up too (after 9 hours of back and forth explaining it). They claim it works now, I'm going to test late tonight and verify when a few minutes of downtime won't affect people.  I have a transition planned to another hosting provider, but because of the complexity of WriterDuet, it's more than just ""move files over and point DNS that way."" I don't know how long it will take, but I'm hoping it'll be done within a few weeks. Until then, the new automatic service I have should remedy the problem. I hope.  We had basically no issues for the past year, until a few days ago when things started to get dicy. Now it seems like something underlying is wrong, and it's breaking my heart. I keep talking to the host, but they can't find a problem thus far. Server maintenance is not my expertise (programming is), and as a single-person startup, it's very hard to deal with this besides moving the site (which as I mentioned is not a simple process).  I am very sorry about this mess, and I am sure it affects the credibility of my service. I'm really sad about that, but know there's not much I can do except remind people:  1) We do backup our site every hour (that process is still working), and you should regularly as well.  2) Our Pro version has automatic backup options to Google Drive, Dropbox, and your hard drive.  3) Our Pro version works offline, and that goes for if our site is off or your computer is (and the real-time servers are unaffected by our recent issues, so it's still fully collaborative in the current problem situations).  4) Buying the Pro version gives me money to invest in this product, which should give you all a better experience. You REALLY SHOULD upgrade to Pro if you rely on WriterDuet, because doing so will help you have the best experience possible, and invest in an even better experience for the future.  5) America."

Screenwriting,3apmvn,Hannibal_Rex,4,Mon Jun 22 15:48:51 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, you get what you pay for.   I don't use WD, although I think it's a great service and a vast, vast, VAST improvement on the other free online options (like Celtx .... shudder).   I would only use it if I was collaborating with somebody on a script and needed the both-use-it-at-once functionality. But that would be in addition to my own software (I use Fade In) - where I would export my work regularly.   I think WD as a company is acting with honesty and good faith. But I also think that the enterprise model SUCKS for users. Look, there's a reason why Adobe has pushed Photoshop and Lightroom and Premiere into subscription models as opposed to pay-for-it-once, own-it-forever (or at least until OS upgrades break it) models ... and it's not because that's better for you, the consumer.   If you want to be a pro a this, you simply need the ability to work on your own time and schedule, with or without internet access, etc. That means either buying the Pro version of WD or buying other software. Given the reasonable costs of some of the other software options, in my opinion, WD's pro version is not a great choice. (If the only competition was Final Draft, that opinion might be different, but it's not).   That being said, WD handles fountain, right? No reason why you can work in fountain most of the time when it's down, and just import it when the time comes.   Again, I like WD, I like the responsiveness of its creator, I like what he's trying to do. But you've got to have reasonable expectations of a free product, even if the logical conclusion of those expectations is that maybe you should buy something."

Screenwriting,3apmvn,beardsayswhat,4,Mon Jun 22 16:26:46 2015 UTC,"Yes.   But more to the point, even if you think FI and WD Pro are equivalent, FI is going to be cheaper in the long run. (I see now that WD has lifetime pricing. Last time I saw it mentioned, it was a monthly fee. This is an improvement and reduces the argument against WD; $85/lifetime is a much better deal than $10/month or whatever the last price I saw quoted was. Glad to see that they're getting away from recurring monthly payments).   I've used FD (admittedly, not for a couple of versions), MMS, and FI. I think that all three of those programs are functionally identical (the minor differences in stuff like, say, how they handle parentheticals, are something you'll get used too quickly). The differences are all relatively minor. Spit and polish. Stability. Scene versioning. Unicode. And, of course, price. And I think FI comes out ahead, BY FAR, in all of those areas.    And it's cheaper. Or you can go free, and deal with stuff like this. And, I mean, even Gmail goes down occasionally."
Screenwriting,3apmvn,HotspurJr,2,Mon Jun 22 16:45:41 2015 UTC,"(FYI, we've never had a recurring fee, though that is likely something I will offer soon along with the option to buy for lifetime.

Screenwriting,3apmvn,HotspurJr,2,Mon Jun 22 17:18:05 2015 UTC,"No problem! I think when I launch the subscription option it'll be $6.99/mo (so lifetime will be equivalent to a little more than one year's worth).

Screenwriting,3apmvn,HotspurJr,4,Mon Jun 22 18:59:51 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but if you've been using WD for a while, I hope you know this is not a reflection of how good the software is and is just a hardware problem that realistically can happen to any company, and is very hard to deal with when you're one guy without a lot of money.  While I'm happy to have free users, it's somewhat unfair to them because they won't have the full experience of offline mode which I know everyone should get, and might have a negative experience without. I can't just give offline mode to everyone, because then there would be less revenue, and I'm not running this site as a charity. I don't do any advertising of other products (except when I think they're genuinely things writers will benefit from), so free users are pretty much just an expense to me if they're not going to upgrade to Pro.  So while I don't blame you for not wanting to put money into a service that hasn't been totally reliable for a few days, if you look back our track record before this was excellent, and we will get back to full strength or I might as well just shutdown now (which is an unlikely decision for a guy whose stuck over 2 years 14-16 hour days into something fairly successful).  To anyone whose been using (and enjoying) WriterDuet for more than a week, I encourage you to buy Pro and get offline mode, both to support the best screenwriting software available (which we are, when available!), and to make sure you can write even if we have technical trouble like has been the case for a few days."

The WD outage a couple weeks ago was unfortunate because it was the first time he and I had time to sit down and do more than talk about characters and their motivations - but the service was down.   I fully intend to throw money at you. The service is fucking great, don't et me wrong, but I want to wait until after the server issues are resolved (and wait a couple weeks to make sure the migration went smoothly).  In fact, the only reason I browsing Reddit is because I can't work on the screenplay. :)  Didn't mean to cause a furrow in your brow. You are doing a fantastic job and I have the patience your audience needs. When it has resolved its hosting issues, I am going to push some of my friends to make the switch too.

The reality is that you can disparage products if you want.  You can have a character rant about how all Volvos are boring.  The police aren't going to arrest you for it.  But it might be a nuisance if the brand starts pushing back ... so sometimes it makes a lot of sense in the production phase to tweak things a little to avoid the pain.  The smaller the movie is - the more people worry about it.      Some real life examples:   One film I was involved with had to put up with legal letters from a top private school objecting that a character's school uniform was too close to theirs - so the character's actions were claimed to disparage the school's brand.   The result:  We just ignored the letters.   Cat bulldozers sued over the sequel to 'George of the Jungle' because they claimed that it put their brand in a bad light.  (The bad guys were bulldozing forests with that particular brand bulldozer)    The result:  Cat bulldozers sued and lost in court   'Kath and Kim' is a TV series about 'bogan' characters (US translation 'Trailer Trash') who think that they are very classy because they drink a certain brand of champagne.   The result:  The sales of that brand of champagne plummeted.   No lawsuits or anything - even though the damage to the brand was genuine.    So it isn't about whether your film causes damage to the brand or is done without the brand-owners consent - it is all about the producers' managing risk and deciding which battles are worth investing effort to fight.  So just use the 'Red Bull' name - it's fine.  It's someone else's job to change it later if it causes problems.  Or, more likely, change it because even though it isn't going to cause problems they can't be arsed to waste time arguing with the E&O insurers over it.   It's mainly about limiting the amount of time wasted on E&O - and what risk they are prepared to underwrite.  Good luck!  -- Mac"

Screenwriting,3ao6cd,plewis32a,3,Mon Jun 22 03:42:23 2015 UTC,Exactly. The reason you use brands is to help establish tone. So do it. Don't make something up if it hurts the vision of the script. Let the lawyers deal to the use of brands after the spec is sold.
Screenwriting,3ao6cd,Ootrab,0,Mon Jun 22 03:46:40 2015 UTC,That's totally fine. You just can't disparage a brand or product.  Edit: on the topic of brands: http://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-rocks-ballers-can-use-nfl-logos-without-consent-2015-6
Screenwriting,3ao6cd,BlankSmitty,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:03:24 2015 UTC,"I'm a little confused on that. Is it because HBO has an existing license to show the logos, (based on their sports programming), that they claim extends to the fictional show?"
Screenwriting,3ao6cd,Ootrab,2,Tue Jun 23 02:17:20 2015 UTC,"No. You have a right to show trademarks and logos. You just are not allowed to disparage or somehow try to damage the brand.

Screenwriting,3ao73t,jaaynaay,2,Mon Jun 22 03:17:31 2015 UTC,"Hey- so quickly read it and there are a few main points I think should be worked on. Hate to say it but Kevin and Rose are unlikable. As are most of their friends- Grant seems okay. Their parents seem great- yet Kevin and Rose are awful to everybody. So the big question from me is- why should I care about these characters?   Two important questions for you- what is Kevin's want? Does he want a successful career, does he want the girl? Because he doesn't seem determined to do either. What is Kevin's need? Does he need to be a better person? Does he need to learn how to accept others? Since the want and needs aren't clear- the plot isn't very developed. Hopefully having a think about this will help. Best of luck."
Screenwriting,3ao73t,pretzel3,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:22:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your feedback!! I actually completely agree, my main characters need to be considerably more likeable. Honestly (especially with Rose) I realized that these characters are just bad people. I think it'd be easier to go for a It's Always Sunny type thing where the characters are bad people, but are sad/pathetic enough to be likeable, so that's something I need to work on. I'll definitely try to work on the needs/wants, I'd been worried about the plot so that should help too! Thanks!!"
Screenwriting,3ao73t,pretzel3,2,Mon Jun 22 14:30:31 2015 UTC,No worries! I see what you mean for It's Always Sunny- they do generally like each other though. And if they're screwing off someone it's because they're determined to go after a want. So it might be good to see Kevin/Rose having some kind moments or dealing with something tough in a noble way. Then when they are determined to go after something we'll be a lot more forgiving if they're not the loveliest person as they do need to have an interesting flaw (though we will always root for them to grow as a person /learn a lesson).
Screenwriting,3ao73t,DSCH415,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:43:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That's some really good advice! Especially since it goes back to the whole wants thing, which I definitely need to work on!"
Screenwriting,3ao73t,AndySipherBull,4,Mon Jun 22 14:58:06 2015 UTC,"Hello. My reviews tend to be a little bit harsh, and I may use one or two expletives. If you shared this because you're looking for a positive, wrapped in rainbows, with a side of ego-stroking ""I loved it, it's the best ever"" review, you won't get it from me.  The idea is intriguing, so I looked it over. One ""We"" is fine, but I wouldn't do two back to back. The second paragraph, except for introducing Kevin, doesn't do anything.   ""who just finished teaching this power flow yoga class. He begins to prepare to exit the class.""  What does he do to prepare to exit? Does he take a rag and wipe down his forehead? This paragraph is completely wasted since it cannot be filmed as is.  Again, you can't film this: Kevin is agitated on stage because an unidentified woman has  been heckling him all night. The woman is speaking with a  poorly faked British accent. He has had enough. He looks as  if he's been crying.  You don't show us Kevin being heckled. You don't show us how Kevin acts when he's agitated. You don't give the lady any lines to actually say so we don't know she's using a fake British accent. You say he looks like he's been crying, so what? His face is puffy? His cheeks are wet?   I want to watch a movie as I read it. You're not providing the experience.  You also have two characters describe Kevin as a douche, but I'm not seeing it. He hasn't done anything douchy. You don't have him in douchy clothes, or act douchy to other people, or say douchy things, but yet two people call him a douche on the same page.  For me to believe that he's a douche, I need him to kill a kitten or shove an old woman or something.   Moving on...  At this point, ROSE LYLES, 26, an innocent half Indian  hipster wearing the world's only t-shirt for the short-lived  Starz show ""Party Down"" approaches the table lead by her  adopted parents CLARISSA, late 40s, dressed excessively  young, and her dad, ALBERT, late 40s, dressed like he thinks  its still the mid-late 90s.   INT. CHUCK CITY, NIGHT Chuck City is a American-style restaurant owned by Rose's  parents, Clarissa and Albert.  1) Who the fuck is Rose? 2) How do we know it's owned by Rose's parents Clarissa and Albert? Is there a big sign that says so? No? Cut it.   Two things: Does she have to be Indian? Not that I don't like Indians, but do you mean Native American or a woman from India? And she has to be half? Specificity is good in action, but when you get too specific in that ""I need a woman to be 5'6'', with a medium build, with hair long enough to cover her tits, but it has to be platinum blonde"" you are being risky.  Also, you call her parents adopted, but how are we to know that? All we see are a half Indian girl come to the table with two people. Does their casting matter? Do her parents usually follow her around while she's working? Is she the only server? Is there only one table? You don't describe enough of the restaurant.  I have no idea what Party Down is, so if I was directing this, I'd probably put her in a black t-shirt and call it a day.  ""Kevin looks at Rose: he might recognize her voice, but not  her face. He has a bad memory for hecklers; they've run  together over the years.""  How am I supposed to film this?  The parents are completely unprofessional. I get that the owners want to see how everyone is, but following their daughter/server, calling her ""sweetie"" and then telling COMPLETE STRANGERS that their daughter is troubled? Wow. If I was Rose, I'd grab the nearest steak knife and kill myself.  So... your cute meet actually DOES NOTHING. You have one short scene with Kevin and his parents. Then you have Rose come to the table AND DO NOTHING. Since she's the only one there, did she not seat them, run the specials, get their water, take their order, deliver the food, refill dad's 10th whiskey, etc? Kevin's just now maybe realizing that he may know her, thirty minutes into this?  I thought this was going to be about Kevin and the doctor, but it's about Kevin and the adopted half Indian girl? Whose adoption doesn't do anything to the story but it adds unnecessary descriptions? If this was a story about an adopted half Indian troubled girl traveling to India to find her real parents then it would mean something. Maybe.  Moving on...  Kevin gives his mom one last hug, shakes his dad's hand, and  his parents drive off. Kevin lets out a hard sigh, wipes  away the tears and walks into his apartment.   His parents drive off, without getting into a vehicle? Without turning on the ignition? Without doing anything that would require them to actually drive away?  They're outside Kevin's apartment building. On the street? In the parking lot? Outside his door?  I assume they drove him from the restaurant to his apartment building. It takes a few minutes, possibly more due to bad weather and traffic. Dad just wants to get home so he can pass out after his 15th whiskey in the recliner. Mom cries constantly because her only son wants to waste his life away. Kevin is stuck in the back seat of the dad's luxury sports car, which doesn't really have a backseat, so Kevin also hates it.   That has to be a hell of a car ride, and YOU WASTE IT on this other scene where the parents turn magically into cars? They drive from the restaurant, to the apartment building, get out of the car, walk to Kevin's door (assuming again), say their good byes, and then walk back to the car and drive away?  Do you think the dad would even get out of the car? His buzz is fading fast and he's already missed the evening news.   ""There is a huge party going on in Kevin's apartment. Beck's  ""SEXX LAWS"" plays in the background; nothing too mainstream  plays, because it's Portland.""  Wait. We've been in Portland this whole time? I don't know this song, so again, if I was directing, I'd probably use something else. And something free.  ""Kevin's  accountant roommate, GRANT, 26,""  What makes him an accountant? Conservative dress... could mean head to two pajamas, or a suit, but it's a house party.. so, I'm gonna put him in jeans and a t-shirt and call it a day.  Is Rose stalking Kevin?  I'm on page 9. I have no idea what I'm reading. Grant is actually the best character yet.   ""Rose is extremely relieved that she's being flirted with,  and not found out.""  I can't film this.  I had every intention of finishing, but I don't get it. I really wanted Kevin and the doctor to get together. Kevin's the flake, she's successful. She teaches him to grow up while he teaches her how to have fun.  BRB while I go write that movie..."
Screenwriting,3ao73t,DSCH415,3,Mon Jun 22 11:04:10 2015 UTC,Honestly a lot of this isn't useful criticism.  It's true his action lines aren't great. But no normal human is going to read   He begins to prepare to exit the class.   and be at a loss as to what to do.  inb4 but actors aren't normal humans
Screenwriting,3ao73t,all_in_the_game_yo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:16:04 2015 UTC,"My point that I probably did not make very well is that he has every available word in the English language to use to convey mood, tone, theme, etc.  If this is a yoga class (and I have never taken a yoga class, so forgive me if I'm totally wrong), the lights may be dim, there may be candles, music playing, etc.  Class ends. Kevin turns off the music. Turns up the lights. Blows out the candles. The yoga students wipe their faces. They roll up their yoga mats. They stretch. They relax. Whatever.  It's a missed opportunity to show the world Kevin lives in.  A lot of these scenes can be described this way. At this point in the process, the writer has a bajillion dollar budget to do whatever he wants and he's wasting it by writing, ""He begins to prepare to exit the class""."
Screenwriting,3ao73t,DSCH415,3,Tue Jun 23 04:52:22 2015 UTC,"his parents drive off. Kevin lets out a hard sigh, wipes away the tears and walks into his apartment. His parents drive off, without getting into a vehicle? Without turning on the ignition? Without doing anything that would require them to actually drive away?   To be fair, I think showing every little detail re: cars is a little pedantic. I think most people reading would be able to work out that they actually entered the car, turned the ignition etc without showing it. Describing these things when we can fill in the gaps seems redundant. Likewike when filming, a director wouldn't show all of the individual stages to driving a car (unless it was done for effect, Edgar Wright style) as we would deduce that those steps took place when we cut to the character driving.  Agree with the rest of the feedback though."
Screenwriting,3ao73t,DSCH415,0,Mon Jun 22 18:28:13 2015 UTC,"It is pedantic, but every line of action has a chance to tell the story. Every verb choice is a way of describing character. If the parents just got out of the car to only get back in the car, why just leave them in the car?   None of the characters have needs, either immediate or long term. Give them needs and you'll make the script come alive. They don't have to be verbalized but as long as you know them, and your characters know them, then the audience will get it.   I've found out that scenes that should work, don't because the character's need is wrong. Fix the need, find the action, and you've got a solid scene. Throwing in the antagonist is icing on the cake.  In the car example, parents have dropped off Kevin outside his apartment building. Dad stays in the car. Mom gets out to cry and give Kevin a hug. Dad honks the horn. Mom tells him to wait.   We don't know Dad wants to go, but we don't know why. We don't need to know why. Mom wants to make sure Kevin's okay.   I think everyone has the capability of writing well, they just have to put more effort into it.   Like I said earlier, when it's just the writer, literally anything can happen. Give your script life. Make it breath. Make it spark. Don't get lazy.  I also wouldn't write any of that, though. I don't think Kevin is the kind of person to watch his parents leave. He knows there's something going on inside, right? I think he'd go straight inside. The audience never sees the parents leave because its not important to the story.  Unless they get hit by a bus and Kevin's not there to see it. Then you've got something."

I also thought True Detective was a bit meandering but I enjoyed the slow character build up to the final scene.

My opinion is it's bad. The critics pretty much unanimously people think it's bad. Ludicrously, laughably, irredeemably bad. You don't. You get to say that and people who think it's bad get to say that and no one needs to take anyone else's opinion as personal criticism.    I know someone who thinks The Fifth Estate is a great movie. No, really. Has watched it like, 50+ times. I barely made it through twice. The second was to make sure I wasn't missing something.   Because you like something, doesn't mean things cannot be objectively judged as sucking tidewater. You still get to enjoy it, though. I liked The Postman.  I think Citizen Kane is an overrated, self-indulgent piece of crap.  But I objectively understand why it's considered a masterpiece.   Subjective experience is not the same as objective judgment."

Your mileage may vary. Clearly there are exceptions.   For me, there are a few separate factors.   The one that most people focus on is access, and yes, this is a factor, although in my mind it's a smaller one. You're more likely to know someone who can help you out, have friends who know people who are looking stuff, that kind of thing. This helps, but it's not that huge a deal.  The much bigger factor, in my mind, is the way being here helps your writing. The friends you make here will actually know what they're talking about when it comes to scripts. The writing groups you form will be full of other people who push you, who know what they're talking about, who you can learn from and be inspired by.   When your career is actually getting started - taking meetings, going out for generals, that kind of thing, you are really going to want to be here. Yes, you can fly in for meetings. But until you have a track record, that will often mean that you're late and behind the curve.   It's all-too-common to have someone read your work, like it, and then the meeting gets pushed a few times and when you do meet them, they need to be reminded what they liked of yours. You want to be able to take a meeting on short notice. You don't want to have to be doing a cost-benefit analysis for flights and meetings if someone wants to meet you.   Two examples from my own experience:  The way I got my first WGA job was literally by being the first person the development exec mentioned the project to, and my partner and I asked interesting questions, so she gave us the first chance to pitch on it - and if she liked our pitch, she decided not to hear anyone else. If it takes two weeks to get a meeting because we have to arrange flights, we don't get that job.  I lost another job because my writing partner had to be out of town for a family emergency, and that delayed our pitch long enough that a different development exec decided to hear other pitches. She flat out told me that she would have gone with ours if it had been the only pitch.  The last thing I'll say is that in LA, people understand. If it takes you 10 years to break in and be working regularly (which is probably typical - I know people who it has taken much longer for) you're going to be in your early-mid 30s and still struggling. In LA, people get that.   In lots of places in the country, that makes you the weird oddball, and you'll feel a lot of pressure to get a real career, settle down, have kids, etc. Here, most of your friends will be in similar boats and thus be a better support system. And that matters."

In some ways a smaller pond gives you better opportunities to break through. That said our industry, being tiny and very risk-averse, doesn't make much of the high quality content I actually want to watch (and create). The long term plan would be for my writing partner and I would be to move to LA, but that requires winning the green card lottery or qualifying for a visa to work over there."

That's quite long right, would you submit it as is? Would 145 pages translate to a 130 minute film or would the time cut down a lot when filmed? On contests: do they generally cater for a certain genre / budget, or is it good to submit anything?  Currently working on a novel but I've put it aside while I work on a sci-fi script. Halfway through things go wrong, the ship crashes and most of the crew die. From there its a jump in primary protagonist until  they discover the ship and I can wrap things up. There's meant to be a 'sins of the father' theme, with a girl witnessing violence and introducing it to her tribe. I imagine it's going to feel corny but I have a mythology to explain it somewhat.  Then, I had an idea I've called 'Short Summer Nights', or 'English Graffiti'. I saw American Graffiti recently and thought it was great, then five ideas that have been floating about my head coalesced into an anthology exploring the fears of things left undone. Excitingly, it might be small enough for me to film myself.  Then there's a dialogue driven short that I've written a few pages of and several adaptations that I'd love to try, just as practise.  For now though, I have to finish the sci-fi. I've got maybe 50 pages and I'm a little worried that I don't have enough to make 100.

Screenwriting,3anc94,emptymetaljacket,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:19:31 2015 UTC,"So, first things first, I liked the premise. I think there's some funny material to be had with this idea. This kind of skit can work, but you need to have more going on to it to keep it interesting for ~10 minutes. It's more of a 3-5 minute idea as written.  That said, there are a number of things that jumped out on even my first read through. The most glaring is simply the grammar and spelling issues. One misspelled word is excusable, if unprofessional, but most of the dialogue and action was very difficult to get through. Too many commas, incomplete sentences, missing words etc.  Having the two characters (I want to say Greg and Chris? But I'm on mobile and can't pull the names up right now) simply repeat the same lines for their first three lines is... well, it threw me off. Especially when they started then speaking like real human beings. That kind of joke could work later in the script, but to me, it sets them up as one-note characters that then suddenly become... not that. I don't know, it just doesn't work for me.  Content- and pacing-wise, I just didn't find a lot of it funny. I'm sorry, but a lot of the dialogue was too drawn-out and slow. The characters felt interchangeable, despite the lengthy introductory descriptions---to me, it seems like if the descriptions are needed, the characters aren't written well enough.  These ""technical details"" aside, the most glaring spot for me was the extended emphasis on the one character having sex with a transwoman. It came across as very mean, lazy, juvenile, and pointlessly offensive. I saw no deeper meaning or message to it. There was no humor in it except for insulting the speaking character (Mike? again, don't have the script up, sorry) for daring to be attracted to her. It was just insulting her for being trans (ie, the ""shemale"" line. I mean holy shit that's not ok.)  It's 2015. This kind of stuff does not fly. This (combined with the grammar/spelling) honestly turned me off of even considering the rest as possibly funny. It's just a low, mean attempt at humor coming at the expense of a very marginalized and oppressed group."

It's a funny joke and cuts to the absolute core of Walter's character: he has chosen to respond to the amorality of Vietnam by establishing his own moral code and adhering to it psychotically. (Which makes him the same character as Anton Chigurh, just played for laughs instead of horror but that's a whole other discussion.)

Screenwriting,3amobq,JRCaine,3,Sun Jun 21 18:57:30 2015 UTC,No. A new scene is a new scene. However it maybe be helpful to your actor or reader to start his first line of dialog with an elipses to indicate that he's continuing his speech from just moments prior.
Screenwriting,3amobq,MaroonTrojan,2,Sun Jun 21 19:54:15 2015 UTC,"If a character is traveling from one room to the next and continuously speaking, I try and lump that all into one slugline (e.g. INT BREAK ROOM/WAITING AREA - DAY... Action like ""Jim paces in the break room while he waits for the Keurig to warm up"", then some dialogue, then in action something like ""As Jim MOVES into the adjoining WAITING AREA..."" then continue dialogue.)  In that case, if you're using (CONT'D), it would obviously apply.  If you are legitimately breaking the speech across two different sluglines, don't use (CONT'D). But I would urge you considering combining stuff into one slug for this. It's more important to feel the flow of a continuous speech than it is to get finicky about sluglines."

Screenwriting,3amlxd,zombdi,2,Sun Jun 21 18:36:35 2015 UTC,"I noticed your comment elsewhere about not getting a response here, so I thought I'd give you a few notes based on my first impressions. I read the first 12 pages.  You start with an ext shot of Vegas, then have a montage of both interior and exterior shots. Your first sentence is really three sentences. It's all sort of vague, establishing shots of Vegas that don't offer any specificity about your story (various people do this, someone does that, a man loses, a woman wins, etc etc) and offer nothing new. If I'd never been to Vegas, I could still drum up that intro from my general knowledge of Vegas. Also, just nix the music suggestions.   And you might want to structure the transition more like:  The flashing lights of casinos --                                                         FADE TO:    INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK  -- the flashing lights of hospital equipment.  So then we're in the hospital. Just introduce the character, no need to call him young man.  I don't really know what his voice over means.  Most people don't get that chance...what chance? If most people don't get that chance, why are they lucky? He later says he's not lucky, just fortunate, but the definition of fortunate is ""favored by or involving good luck or fortune; lucky"" so that's pretty nonsensical too.    I assume after he picks up his phone, we flash back to how he ended up in the hospital, but you don't call it a flashback, so while I was reading it I assumed he'd been discharged from the hospital and was going to buy drugs.  Confusing.  Your drug buying scene suffers from beginning and ending the scene.  Start in the middle. We don't need to see him knocking on the door and saying peace and all that, unless it's important somehow.  Are he and Tex friends? What dealer wants to know or cares where the money comes from?  What homeless guy (or anyone really) doesn't know what Oxy is? And if he is one of the few homeless people to have no experience with Oxy, Martin's ""nice"" gesture of giving him a highly addictive substance that he's unfamiliar with, then topping it off with booze doesn't come across as nice, exactly.  Having known a few people with pill addictions (functional and non), even they're usually out once they combine Oxy and alcohol, let alone an apparent novice.  And does martin have emotional reactions to anything? He's not upset or angry or in pain when he's shot. He's not upset or angry when he's drugged and kidnapped to a Mexican commune.  He's not upset or bothered when a gun fight breaks out all around him at said commune...  He barely reacts to any of it.    In the first 12 pages he's: mugged, shot in the gut (?), possibly suicidal (is that why he's on the ledge?), injected with something by an old man, kidnapped, cattle prodded, shot at again, and his response is, ""This is pretty crazy.""  So, I don't know, man. I can't say I connected with the story, but in part that's because Martin is so disconnected from it all himself.  Maybe that's intentional and he's so Oxy'd out that he doesn't have emotions, but the script doesn't indicate that. Maybe there's some irony in how he considers himself fortunate even though he still lives with his mother and gets shot by a homeless guy, but so far the script doesn't indicate that either.  The writing itself wasn't terrible, though I think dialogue was your weakest link.  It's flat and has no subtext...it just says what it is and moves on. Every voice kind of sounds like weary Vin Diesel.  I guess I just didn't find that I particularly cared about the characters, at least in the way they came across in this draft. How old is Martin, by the way? Is his whole intention, as you describe it in your logline, really to impress his mother enough so that he can keep living at home?"

I feel like I'm not getting my point across correctly, so again, could you tell me what do you think of any particular scene? Particularly the jail scene?"
Screenwriting,3amlxd,happyclownbot,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:35:48 2015 UTC,"I understand you are looking for any feedback but by saying the script has missing scenes and is not complete makes me not want to read it. I want to be rewarded with a good story but that's not going to happen if it's not complete. If you want feedback on specific scenes post them for feedback not the whole script and force the reader to pick them out.   With that said I went ahead and read the first 5 pages to give you some feedback. It's honest but harsh.    First I have no idea what the plot is about and after 5 pages I should have a clue, I would have read on if I had. All I know is that Martin orders about $2,500 in drugs a week but yet he is modest and highly function able. This doesn't share any characteristics of someone who uses that much oxy (watch Intervention to see the inside mind of an addict) and are we supposed to be sympathetic for him before he's shot? I didn't, I just saw a looser drug addict bitching about luck.   The homeless man came off as a misunderstood unfortunate man and after his speech about how nice Martin is to him and how others ignore him, it seemed way out of a character, even for a bum to shoot the guy who just gave him a moment he cherished. You can be shocking like you're trying to do but you set up the characters to be to friendly first.   Martin should not hand him an Oxy at first (all homeless know what Oxy, no need to tell us) instead Martin should agree to buy him the beer and when he sits to share it with the homeless man then he takes out an Oxy and pops it, offering one to the homeless man who takes notice of the large amount of pills. From there they have a short and quick conversation with some undertone tension (i.e. The homeless man keeps tip toeing around the oxy) and Martin gets up to leave and then you have your conflict.   You could easily take out a nice chunk at the begging and still get the point across. Have your opening scene of the strip and people doing their thing but then cut straight to Martin buying Oxy from Tex (his description sounds clownish even for a drug dealer) everything before this with the voice over trying to comprehend the meaning of luck is unneeded and confusing. If we are supposed to understand how unlucky Martin is in a city where luck can strike at any moment then show us, don't just try to be clever with dialog to expose a major characteristic of your protagonist.   FORMATTING: Your action, like your logline is very wordy and all over the place. The first 2 blocks of text can each be cut in half by writing like a script and not a novel, example:     Various gamblers drink and play games, people perform on the streets, a mother gives a child some money and the child runs off. A guitarist performs for an empty crowd at a bar.Someone smokes and then puts out a cigarette while playing slots. The person pulls the lever and the slot machine spins then hits the machine for losing. A woman playing Keno thinks for a moment, then enters the numbers 80 and 8. She wins. The flashing lights of casinos fade to the flashing lights of hospital equipment.    Should read faster like this:    Crowds of people pack the strip. MARTIN (description) passes a guitarist performing alone at an empty bar. A man takes the last drag of a smoke, pulls a slot machine handle - loser.  A woman playing Keno pauses before she enters the numbers 80 and 8 - winner! A look up and the flashing lights of casinos fade to the flashing lights of hospital equipment.    The Dialog between Mother and Martin is very boring, on the nose and not informative at all, they say nothing in almost 2 pages that is relevant to the story. His mom just points out how much of a looser he is then saids I have the money to support your habit but not the bums. This contradicted her trying to get him to change his ways, making the whole conversation irrelevant.   I don't mean to pick you apart but you asked and need honest feedback otherwise you'll just be waisting your time and building your hopes. I hope by giving examples of what went wrong you can go back and make the story something special.  It takes time and multiple rewrites to even get a decent draft so don't get discouraged, just keep grinding at it.

Screenwriting,3am01g,HotspurJr,2,Sun Jun 21 19:51:15 2015 UTC,"Okay. You start (after the teaser) with two and a half pages of exposition that should be story (IMO) spread through your script.  We don't need to know much of anything except these people are crammed into an overstuffed car passing the ""Detroit City Limits"" sign.   It's nice dialogue in that it's sounds like the way they would talk and shows something of their relationships though I'd think the kid would be going ""YOU SWORE!"" and trying to get her into trouble.  At any rate:  we'll know they came for the funeral at the funeral.  We'll know he gets the house when the attorney turns over papers and keys. We'll know about the brother when he asks, ""Are you sure he doesn't want it?""   We'll learn about the grandmother rom what's in the house, from questions the kids ask, from what we see.   (Oh yeah - in that opening - give those boys names.  If you don't want us to know who's who yet, call them ""Shrimp"" and ""Doucheface.""  Their names for each other. Call 'em LITTLE BROTHER and BIG BROTHER and then ""Little"" and ""Big"" in action. But call them something because it's just irritating as is.) From three pages I think I can tell you're a pretty good writer.  But you don't seem to want to actually write.    Consider this a treatment and go write your script. It'll be good. That car scene should be a half page. Then let your audience discover stuff as they watch your film.   Oh - I think the answer to your ""how short"" question is 85. -ish.  yanno"
Screenwriting,3am01g,HotspurJr,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:13:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, in my opinion, it is too short.   Couple of thoughts:   Two quick sentences might describe a multi-minute sequence.   This raises a red flag. ""Atlanta burns"" isn't the sort of thing that contemporary screenwriters do. ""They fight."" is generally only used when a fight choreographer is onboard already.   Part of your job, as a horror writer, is to take those horror ""gags"" and make them work on the page. There's a balancing act between too much and too little, and some writers bury their scripts in too much detail, but it sounds like you're doing the opposite.   I have a hard time imagining what two sentences you have that might describe a 3-5 minute sequence where you would still, fundamentally, be doing your job as a writer.  (If I'm wrong, I'm super curious. Share those two sentences?)  Obviously I can't say without reading your script, but I strongly suspect that you and simply saying what happens, not dramatizing what happens.   That being said, you wrote that you ""hit all of the beats that I wanted to,"" which just points at another possible problem. Do you have enough beats? If you outlined a contemporary horror film that you love which is similar to what you're going for, would it have about the same number of story beats? What you ""wanted"" is only adequate if it's enough. So you could outline some similar films and see how the OUTLINES compare. That's often edifying.   Very low budget horror scripts do tend closer towards 90 pages than 120, and I would argue that something like 105-110 is a better target than 120 anyway. And if you're very low budget horror and got up to 80, you'd probably be okay.  Maybe.   But more often than not, when somebody has a massive length problem, which you do (because you were aiming for 120, and got half of that) it's representative of a fundamental failure in either scene craft or structure.   So I keep coming back to:  ""Two quick sentences might describe a multi-minute sequence.""  Which just, honestly, strikes me as probably a major error. If you're doing that twice, and have another dozen times when you use two sentences when you should be writing something out over half a page, that could solve your problem right there.   That's my guess. Show me the two sentences and I'll be able to offer further guidance."

I have issues with that scene, but they're mostly a function of it being fairly clunky to read because of the way you've named your characters and the constant repetitions of ""older boy"" and ""younger boy.""   There's also a clarity issue - given that you single out that he's forcing him on the bed, and that the younger kid ""struggles under the weight"" of the older boy, I'm not sure if there's supposed to be a rape vibe here or not.   If the older boy were a year or two older, that would be unambiguous. But at 12, it's a bit of a stretch."
Screenwriting,3am01g,NoMoreMrNiceGaius_6,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:45:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd rather not even have this scene at all, but an opening scare seems to be de rigueur in modern horror.   I could (probably should) use the actual character names to make it less of a chore to read. The only reason I didn't is because I prefer that the reader does not know exactly which adult characters these children represent. (The vagueness of this prelude, including the is he or is he not ""rape-iness"", is very intentional.)"
Screenwriting,3am01g,Slickrickkk,2,Sun Jun 21 19:15:46 2015 UTC,"Here's the problem:  Twofold, actually.  First, that scene isn't scary. If this is a horror film and you want a scare to start the script, you need a real scare. This could be the opening of a drama, much more so than it feels like the opening of a horror.   Secondly, the ambiguity here which you call intentional won't play on screen. To shoot this, a bunch of specific choices are going to have to be made which will push this very much towards or away from rapey.   Ambiguity can be tough like that. Ambiguous moments can be great, but you need to write something that will be ambiguous when shot, not something that makes it hard to tell what should be shot."

Fade In is incredible value for the price when compared to Final Draft.  The one thing I DO prefer about FD over FI is the way FD handles notes. When a script gets to the point of being sent to and commented on by collaborators, I like the way FD9 has a separate window that you can open up and use to classify notes by color and type, and filter and sort. It makes working through them pretty easy."

Making sure your scripts are formatted ""correctly"" is obvious, recommending Final Draft for beginners is irresponsible and naive. Beginners should NOT jump out and pay for expensive software, because there is no need to. Many pros don't any more.

Close enough so that your script at least resembles these pages. That said, there is no absolute standard format within the U.S. film industry. The format used by professional screenwriters can vary considerably from writer to writer - but overall the format used by one professional writer generally resembles that used by another professional writer. Nuances may vary – margins slightly different, a dash here or there, parentheticals used this way or that or not at all – but overall, professional screenplays fit within or near these guidelines.  Clarity is the goal. If your script’s format can be easily read by anyone working in the film industry, then it falls within acceptable standards."

For the record, I have long maintained that many programs are adequate for writing screenplays.  I personally prefer Scrivener for organization and Final Draft for writing scenes.  I think Final Draft is worth the money because it's solid, dependable and every company in the business is familiar with it.  Also, because it's a mature company and not a one-man shop, I know it will be in business next year.  If you want to write with something else, go to it.

If a beginner isn't willing to invest in themselves and their career for a couple hundred dollars, about half the cost of one semester of a university class, they certainly don't have the commitment to be screenwriters.    Also, programs like Movie Magic Screenwriter and Final Draft don't just format screenplays correctly. MMSW has great tools for outlining, rewriting, different templates for TV or feature, radio, play or novel.   However, the best formatting tool is The Screenwriter's Bible by Trottier."

I tried to do the cheap-o workaround on my first script, following the whole ""writing is free"" logic. You know what's not free? Time. If you have a day job and you're not a cyborg, you'll have a limited amount of writing time. Burning hours of that time screwing around with a Microsoft template or some nonsense is a waste, especially when you're just getting started and have so much to learn. At the time, FD was the only game in town. Today, there are lots of other options. I too prefer MMSW, exactly because the outline-to-script feature takes a lot of the blank page terror out of the process, but I'm not sorry to have used FD. I've seen the cognitive shutdown that happens when someone has to adapt to a new software program years into their career and it's not pretty. Since I learned both programs years ago, I can't be spooked in the same way. (Related: In TV, the showrunner dictates the software, and everybody uses and trades files in the same format; in features it probably matters somewhat less, but I bet there are times when work files do get handed off. I have always wanted to be a TV writer, so this was a total no-brainer for me.) There IS something to be said for making an external, objective commitment to yourself as a writer. ""Half the cost of one semester of a university class"" might be a little steep (depending on the school, that could be $2K), but I was doing a mental evasion until the day I bought some software, which was ""I don't even know if this is something I want to do."" Deciding to buy the software was the moment when I acknowledged that yes, this IS something I want to do, and I re-prioritized my life accordingly.  I leaned heavily on Trottier's book when I was first writing.  You can educate yourself for free -- except that, as above, time is not an unlimited resource. You want to get better as quickly as possible; reading and writing go hand in hand when learning new skills. They teach kindergarteners to write letters at the same time they're taught to read. Professors assign both class readings and essay exams. It's not insane to think that as you're starting to read scripts, you might want to try your hand at it simultaneously.    Look, it's easier to start with sharpened pencils than having to cut down a feather into a quill and grinding your own ink; it's easier to work inside a program that manages a lot of the noodgie details that working writers delegate to script coordinators. You absolutely can start with the feather and the unground ink. You'll know a lot of about cutting down feathers and making ink, but later on, you'll find that nobody else ever thinks about that stuff."

In addition, you can educate yourself for free. The internet is full of wonderful resources and information.  If you want to give useful advice, tell a beginner to read lots of scripts (which can be downloaded for free) and write (which can be done for free or inexpensively.)  Why spend a couple hundred dollars on inferior software, especially when a beginner has not developed any preferences to software in the first place? Silly.  You want software to help you format scripts,, outline, rewrite, has more templates they you could need, why not buy a whole suite:  http://slugline.co/blog/sushi  You could buy Highland, Slugline, Fade In Pro, Fade In Mobile and Scrivener all for less than Final Draft and still have money left over.

Screenwriting,3al3a4,nitrohawk91,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:17:29 2015 UTC,"Generally, no. Facts can't be copyrighted or trademarked and a subject doesn't own the rights to his own story (think unofficial/unauthorized biographies or television like E! True Hollywood Story). That is not to say, however, that - in the event of distribution - you wouldn't be opening yourself up to liability.   Something of great weight to bear in mind is the extent to which the story exists in the public domain. Generally, laws will protect content that is recognizable to the public as long as the story being manufactured doesn't draw from other copyrighted material (ie. a book, article or preexisting treatment interpreting the ""actual events"" - it is crucial to know that unpublished material CAN be copyrighted). But laws differ from sovereign state to sovereign state therefore you'd have to check the state of laws on libel, defamation, breach of privacy and copyright infringement in the country of choice.  Final consideration: I imagine that a spec script ""based on/inspired by a true story"" won't attract as many enthused productions as believed if only because attorneys will obviously be consulted to avoid liability and attorneys cost money. (Also consider that the price at which rights are negotiated when a production company is introduced into the equation rockets immediately). I'd imagine that if you could present the script to a producer with a secured agreement in hand for the subject's life story rights, you'd pique more interest."
Screenwriting,3al3a4,emptymetaljacket,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:08:29 2015 UTC,"""It depends.""  I am not a lawyer.  Here are the issues, as I understand them and apply them in my own work.   First of all, if you use his real name, or change his name but make it obvious who it is about, you open yourself up to a lawsuit for defamation. And not just from him. If the person has, say, a daughter and you give him a daughter in the script, she might be able to sue you, too. You will necessarily be making these people say things that they didn't say, and that is, legally, a problem. You need to be able to prove they said everything they said.   Obviously, sometimes they don't sue. But I know ""The Social Network"" was on pins and needles about that. They were prepping their defense based on the claim that he hadn't sued about the book it was based on, but ultimately that was a production that was prepared to deal with a major lawsuit, and my understanding is that they knew they could well have lost.   The more of a public figure somebody is, the more leeway you have, but this is a grey area where writers/productions lose lawsuits.   The second place you have to worry is the article author. If you are adapting a writer's article, you need the rights to the article. You can get around this if you can independently source all of the facts in the article that you use. But if, say, the article is the only source of key facts or quotes, then you are open to a lawsuit from the article's writer.   Script shadow is not a lawyer. He's also not a particularly ethical person (before you take his advice on a legal matter, bear in mind that he made his name for himself by sharing material he did not have the legal right to share). I mean, I wouldn't take his creative advice, either, but I admit that the only time I ever read him is when his name pops up on Screenwriter Twitter for saying something particularly stupid. That happens fairly regularly."

A lot of the humor kind of falls flat, though, and the poor characterization and thin plot don't really manage to hide behind the lampshade you've hung on them. The audience always has to connect with the characters in some way, even if they're silly archetypes drawn in deliberately broad strokes."

Much of the little asides are visual in nature: stuff like describing a woman as ""totally into him"" was meant to save me the trouble of saying ""she leans over the counter and twirls her finger through her hair"" because my first attempt at that half-page montage was four pages long, which is unacceptable. Other ones set a mood or an expression (""Eevee is in heaven"") or express the meaning of a glance (""Sure. Whatever."") which had the end result of turning what could potentially have been a 40/50-page segment into 20 pages.  So that leaves me with character thoughts and author asides:   They're not having any more of this nerd shit.  You get the idea.  ... his ""wife""  He knows the answer.  He tries to think of a response. Finding none ...  Almost an afterthought ...  It's all an act for Eevee, but Ian is completely out of his element.  She wasn't supposed to see that.  Ian is starting to have his doubts.  Lemme indulge for a bit.  She's lying.   Admittedly quite a few. Probably not as saturated as you perceived it to be, but you did see it as a significant problem, so let's look into it.  The reason for including most of them is that I could express it through body language but chose not to.   The guards slump. Tapping their feet impatiently. Sneering at guests.  His voice drones.  She hangs off his arm. There's a ring on her finger, but it's made out of paper. Closer inspection would reveal it's a rolled-up hundred-dollar bill.  He nods with self-assuredness. He recites his answer off by heart:  He opens his mouth to protest, but gulps and runs away instead.  As Ian turns to leave, Tom calls out one last thing ...  Eevee leans comfortably in her chair. Ian is stiff. Eyes darting.  The two of them freeze. Deer in headlights. Wait, this was actually how I wrote it.  Ian smiles, but his eyes betray a hint of uncertainty.  It is a large room with many intricate and specific details, as follows:  She unconsciously massages her throat.   I have no frame of reference to determine if that's better, but since I was crucified for the opposite opinion and then conceded I may be wrong, I'm going to assume people will say ""much better"". As I was writing the script, the only difference I saw was that it was longer and not at all necessary. I could just say ""she's lying."" Let's see if I can watch out for that and work on it in the future."
Screenwriting,3aks88,Asiriya,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:41:31 2015 UTC,"I found the original writing more annoying than anything.

Closer inspection would reveal it's a rolled-up hundred-dollar bill.   How do you say that visually?   Ian smiles, but his eyes betray a hint of uncertainty.   How?   It is a large room with many intricate and specific details, as follows:   Fine, but which are of narrative importance, the rest will probably be handled by set design.

That's definitely not something that needs further elaboration, or at least not in such a way that it wouldn't make the little moment bigger than I want it to be. It's a flash.  The room: Surprisingly, every detail I mention in the script is intended to come into play later on. I had first written ""It is a large room with many intricate and specific details, and the ones that are important to the story are as follows:"" but then figured that was precisely the kind of omniscience that people seem to despise, so I took that part out and changed it to ""It is a large room with many intricate and specific details, as follows:"" and figured people would understand the intention.

If you smash me over the head with cutesy descriptions, then I'm going to hold your story and characters to an even higher standard than usual.  Your writing doesn't rise to this level.

You've named them, we'll see them. The death of either Ian or Eevee.   On 5: I'm sure someone has a good example of why this is wrong, but I always think that if a writer tells us something then it should be taken as word of God. If you tell me she's flawless you either need to make a joke of it (and have a clear punchline) or be correct.  BTW, I wasn't a massive fan of this. Cutting to anal sex isn't what I'd want to put in my script, and there were a lot of moments that just seemed crass for the sake of it. Cupping balls? It isn't funny and is at odds to you establishing Lauren as a virgin. I did like the fake-out 'protagonists' at the beginning, but I want Ian and Eevee to die too, and quickly. If that's intentional I'd argue it isn't the best idea for your protagonists.  For all your setting up the hotel I don't really feel like I know it as a location (my focus wasn't on it and I skipped over most of what you said about it because other stuff feels more relevant). I might move the introduction to when Eevee arrives, or rearrange the order of the scenes a little so that we see Bathan and Lauren leaving after the hotel is introduced."

Some stuff is on point and others show that the elements of the story are misleading, which is good for me as I can work on those sorts of things and get better clarity about the tone and expectations of the story.  Yes, there's a lot of crass stuff in there, which are mainly just 30 second gags without much bearing on the story. I think it does set the wrong tone, especially when I want to avoid portraying Eevee's occupation as immoral in and of itself.  Another thing I didn't notice was that Eevee doesn't have any likeable features. Ian at least has a cat and shows hints of a conscience, but Eevee just does whatever she wants and constantly lies to people.  I'm also worried that the hotel hasn't been as big a character as I wanted. Whenever we spend time exploring it, it's always through a dialogue-less montage which means people are gonna skim over it, evidently. That's a problem. Hmm.  Cheers. Lots to consider."
Screenwriting,3aj415,sansidee,3,Sat Jun 20 18:13:59 2015 UTC,"Take this constructively.  Starts strong-ish and funny (the jokes are hit-and-miss of the ""funny on first viewing"" variety) and the first page reads like a possibly great dark comedy but it gets really boring, really fast. In my opinion, the problem is that you started with an intriguing and possibly really interesting premise but then that isn't developed and the resolution is unbelievably simplistic; I was disappointed but remember that only every happens if the premise is really promising which it is- but also squandered.  The equivocity shouldn't just be the reason for a recurring joke between the protagonists; it should BE the story. It's never developed. I read it twice though, admittedly, briskly because it dragged (and I started skipping lines when I realized the story wouldn't address what had really piqued my interest) but if I read correctly the existence of ""doubles"" is summarily dismissed in one line: ""The men’s heads peer over the bodies of Alan and Howard lying next to each other."". Without that one line in which you announce the actual existence of the two characters ""Alan"" and ""Howard"" I never would've understood it and would've kept waiting for some fantastical and fantastically comical ruse to unravel.  It's far too simple a cop out and highly doubt it would ever work on screen. As a reader I was confused and was left expecting more, convinced that it couldn't just all be a coincidence that is well beyond ""improbable"". A viewer would be left disoriented and unentertained. I know it's a lot to ask, but I honestly thought it was going to lead to a climax à la Fincher's ""The Game"" (by which I mean, ""in the same vein as"").  The progression is fine. It's definitely one of the most recycled genre-""subversions"" in more-than-one-baddie history but it works. However it should be the least of your worries. The characters are skin deep and that would be ok if they were advancing a story which doesn't feature them: ya know, deus ex machina. But that's not the case here. Your characters are empty dei ex machina that don't actually excite any narrative progression; they just begin the story and end it.  Sidenote, I was intrigued by the capitalization (besides characters for the first time) of just SOUNDS. I know it's very arbitrary. I use a lot of italics but only because everything I introduce on screen has a meaning and is in some way pertinent, thought more often than not central, to the story.

I suppose the thought I had was that it was supposed to be a case of two targets looking exactly the same, because both reflect the rich city folk who love to binge drink and get wasted, who essentially typify an entire group - the faceless ""suits"".  I liked the idea of how these two very different hitmen (in comparison to londoners) bond over the murder of bland city workers that might as well be the same person.   I'm going to try a re-write to highlight this more, so thanks for pointing this out.   In terms of character development, you're right, I made some simple caricatures. Wasn't really thinking much beyond that. I'm still working this out, as developing characters is probably a weakness I have, but I'll go back and add in more character touches.   Thanks again for the helpful feedback!"
Screenwriting,3aj415,emptymetaljacket,5,Sat Jun 20 22:05:25 2015 UTC,"Don't mention it- I can only hope you interpreted everything in a constructively critical light, as it was genuinely intended that way. Honestly, no flattery or faux-sense of obligation to right the harshness of my previous comment, I find the idea at heart to be very intelligent and one that I would love to see properly developed; which I am positive you are capable of doing because the story, now that you've explained it, makes sense. If you intend to post it again, I will be looking forward to the re-write as nothing that you described in the above comment transpired upon a reading of this first draft. Adjusting dialogue, giving it some depth and ""actuality"" would help in that regard.  Final piece of advice and take this more from someone who has lived the environment than someone who actually has validated expertise (though I take some joy in knowing that what very little I have ever written has garnered nothing but high praise from professionals and established directors I know)- the one constant to be found of all great filmmakers and writers lies in their methodology to tackling format, storytelling, development. Every single great filmmaker has a unique style. You should remember that there are very few rules but, though most of them are in place to avoid production companies headaches while reading, you should feel free to be as inventive and descriptive as necessary in order for your story to BE and come across as your story. Don't be afraid to provide annotations or guide the reader if the concept is a highly metaphorical or complex one. Any one of Tarantino's scripts will be instructive in that regard as they are wildly different from the standard that production companies have grown accustomed to (in that vein, avoid any Nolan scripts excluding Memento- they become exceedingly trite after a while). A personal recent favorite of mine is Rian Johnson's ""Looper"" (Brick is also a great read)- he is exceptionally vivid in detailing how he intends for the story to be reflected on screen."

So don't worry about what the networks are expecting to buy.  Use this as a writing sample. As such, it's ok if it runs a little long. For a half-hour writing sample, typically it's okay if it goes around 30-35 pages. I got hired as a staff writer on a show with a sample pilot that was 38 pages, but it was good material that people responded to. I probably wouldn't go longer than that.

Screenwriting,3aiab0,GoodAaron,2,Sat Jun 27 06:53:36 2015 UTC,"From my view of reading tons of teleplays, most teleplays I read go over the allotted time frame.  For example, the Simpsons script ""You Only Move Twice"" is 44 pages long.  FOr 23 minutes of air time, that seems kind of long.  But upon reading the whole teleplay, you see that about 3 pages worth of material was cut out.  And all the dialogue is double spaced.  Basically it seems, once production starts, there's bound to be a scene or two that gets cut later in the editing cycle anyway.  And sometimes the director will alter part of your scene in the final directors draft.  In other words, its not a problem writing a teleplay longer than you expect it should be (within reason).  Since the story is the most important part for the spec script.  If it got picked up someday, someone else (a producer or director) is most likely going to trim it down.  My problem is actually the opposite.  Almost all the spec scripts I write end up being below the standard page limit.  Because I focus so much on trying to make every single piece of dialogue meaningful that by the end, I've only got 25 pages of a script that should be 40+ pages long (if its a sitcom style comedy).  And I usually have to insert more jokes and character development that I feel is not needed.  In other words, pad out the script."
Screenwriting,3aiab0,maxis2k,2,Sat Jun 20 16:10:51 2015 UTC,"I see this more often with hour long shows than thirty minutes shows - the Breaking Bad and Fargo pilots, for example, were a full hour without commercials.    This may be due to the fact that before your pilot actually sells to someone, you don't necessarily know whether it'll end up on cable/network (commercials) versus HBO/Netflix (no commercials).  I also get the impression that pilots get a little more leeway, not to mention higher budgets.  I would say it's fine."
Screenwriting,3aiab0,FatherDude,2,Sat Jun 20 16:56:42 2015 UTC,"Don't focus on the ""time length"" of the pilot-- which, unless you've filmed a lot of your own stuff, you probably don't really know that well anyway.  All that really matters is the page length-- and while 35 pages is the median length of a single-cam comedy pilot these days, you can get away with up to 40 pages.   If that's not enough space then your pilot is almost certainly over-stuffed."
Screenwriting,3aiab0,Zodraz,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:43:37 2015 UTC,Couple of questions (although I largely agree with GoodAaron).   How much experience do you have? Inexperienced writers tend to write flabbier scenes than they need to.  Cable or network?  Single cam or multi?  How are you estimating that it's longer than 23 minutes?
Screenwriting,3ahtq3,mjpizza,8,Sat Jun 20 08:48:49 2015 UTC,"Make sure you are also practicing the churn and burn. Sitcoms are written fast as fuck. Outline to first draft in a week, so they have time to do a comedy punch up before production starts.  The plus side is that sitcoms can and will hire story guys AND joke masters. The Room as a whole can be awesome, with awesome people in different areas. Then the story guys are the saviors of the outlines, and the joke guys the champs of the final pass.  Personally I use the UCB philosophy for writing funny. Here's their textbook, though I'd strongly suggest classes if you are in NYC/LA. Also good is the Helpful Hints section in this.  Basically, the scene is not really about buying a fish. The scene is there to explore the behavior between the character and the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper or you main characters have a inner philosophy that leads to funny behavior.  If the shopkeeper thinks of his fish as prostitutes with him as a pimp, you have a wealth of possibilities for funny lines and actions in the scene.  Or the character treats buying a fish like buying a hotrod high end car.  Sitcoms are ALL about your characters' philosophies and behaviors being highlighted by different SITusations.   Also for example, just look at Happy Endings. Every single character had a distinct personality and philosophy so anyone could be a weirdo or straightman depending on the episode."
Screenwriting,3ahtq3,tpounds0,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:37:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure how improv techniques would help with sitcom writing. I'm not saying they wouldn't, I just don't really see the connection at the moment.  To my mind, improv is very much about the moment. Several people working together to create unexpected sparks. Sitcom writing (for me) is the opposite: one guy on his own spending hundreds of hours writing and carefully editing a script, while keeping the lines that seem less contrived - like they could've been thought up very quickly.  I would imagine that none of those guys from Whose Line Is It Anyway have written successful sitcoms - completely different skill set. If I'm wrong, feel free to correct me. I'd be interested to know of exceptions.  I like the idea of a shopkeeper who has a whole philosophy about what his role is - even if it's rather ridiculous or delusional. I feel that's part of ""treating every character like an A character"", which is something I'm working on.   I'll check out Happy Endings. I'm kind of put off by the title, but I'm willing to give it a look-see."
Screenwriting,3ahtq3,tpounds0,2,Sun Jun 21 08:01:56 2015 UTC,"First, UCB has sketch writing classes. And sitcom episodes are almost all written in the writer's room. The showrunner and all staff writer's beat out the outline of a story until they have a scene by scene outline.  The writer goes home and turns that 5-10 page outline into the 30 page script. Sends it the the showrunner, he makes notes on it. The writer rushes to change what's not working, and bring it back to the writer's room. Then the joke pass begins.  The Joke Pass has the writers' room assistant put the script up on a big projector from their laptop, and every writer who isn't currently working on an episode will go line. by. line. and suggest better jokes/lines/details. Most writer's feel accomplished if 10-15% of the lines they wrote actually make it to air.  Writer's Bloc Podcast will open your eyes to the comedy writing world.  If you want to be a working sitcom writer, you have probably 168 hours from rough draft to everyone suggesting jokes better than your. And that's without sleep.   Second, Drew Carey and the Drew Carey show. Nuff said.  Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Mindy Kaling, Ben Schwartz, Adam McKay, Abbi Jacobson,  Ilana Glazer, Paul Downs, Rachel Bloom, Brian Gallivan, Scott Adsit... all writers that got their start with improv.

Every day they open the newspaper (or whatever news website they prefer) and find a current event. They then write ten jokes about that current event. They repeat this with ten other current events, resulting in one hundred jokes. Some then choose ten of those jokes to submit to one of the late night talk shows that buy jokes, while stand-ups might choose one joke out of the hundred to work into their act. Others do the exercise simply for practice. The theory here is that trying to craft a single perfect joke will cause you to freeze up. Our writer brains work in two modes: creative and critic. In order to free the creative mode, you need to turn off the critic. So the joke writer focuses on quantity rather than quality."

Screenwriting,3ahtq3,wtdoor,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:52:19 2015 UTC,"I think /u/tpounds0 makes a few good points, especially:   The scene is there to explore the behavior between the character and the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper or you main characters have a inner philosophy that leads to funny behavior.   is the core of sitcom comedy writing. It's all about the character constellation. You need to design the characters in such a way that basically any 'situation' results in (comic) conflict (because conflict is at the core of all writing). One tool I learned to help you with this is called Ofman's quadrants, a tool which is also used in the workspace to analyze the different types of people and how they complement or oppose each other.  In it's core it's about defining a character's qualities, pitfalls, challenges and allergies, and make sure the different characters have opposing pitfalls and allergies. For instance, if you look at a few of the characters in Friends:  Monica Quality: tenacity Pitfall (=going overboard on that same quality): obsessiveness Challenge (=what to do to avoid the pitfall): loosen up, letting things go Allergy (=something she hates in other people): extremely laidback, lassez-faire attitude    Joey Quality: laidback Pitfall: Uninvolved, uninterested Challenge: To apply himself Allergy: Frenetic, overcompetitive people    For every character you can define multiple 'qualities' and from there their pitfalls, challenges and allergies. You can see that based on the above qualities of the characters of Joey and Monica, that for them to get into conflict you put those two in a situation where Monica has to rely on Joey to get something done. And this is only one of the multitude of situations you can put the 6 main characters of Friends in where conflict will naturally ensue-- all because the characters are so well defined. As one of my teachers put it: 'A well defined character constellation in a sitcom is like a pond: you only need to throw in a little stone and it will have a ripple effect through everything'.  Now, does this automatically lead to comedy? No, but it makes finding interesting situations with a lot of conflict a lot easier, and it helps you to define the characters sharply, and that is what you need in a (classical) sitcom. You don't want too much complex characters with multiple layers and hidden paradoxes. The audience wants to see Monica obsess over stuff and Joey hit on all the girls, week after week.  In every great sitcom, you can pretty much describe every character with one or two lines. ""Joey is the kind of Italian-American, handsome smooth talker who wants to be an actor but is not the brightest of the bunch"". You immediately have a picture. ""Phoebe is the kind of hippie-esque girl who writes songs for her cats and talks to everybody's dead grandmother"". And so forth.  Now, as far as comedy goes: I saw somewhere in the comments you said that doing improv-comedy is your nightmare. Did you do any kind of comedy in front of an audience for a while? Maybe sketch comedy or stand up-comedy? If not, you have to. Because you can not sit at home and assess what's funny, you have to get out and try jokes on an audience. It is the only way. If you don't, you will never be a good comedy writer.   Pretty much every writer on a sitcom is a failed stand up-comedian, or has tried something along the lines. Why? Because it's the only way you can find out what's funny on a stage. The fact that you're funny in a bar or on twitter is nice, and it does help, but it's not enough."

If this is a black comedy I'd think it'd be great to set the tone with something funny right away, someone with a hand blown off already?  Instead the tone I got was ""poor me, I'm a flunky.""  That I don't think is funny.  As we should all know, there is a rule about directing on the page.  That being said, it's also NOT a rule.  But I'm not sure why the direction on the page is necessary in this case.  You have a cliche, but amusing intro that made me think ""I want to read this"" in formatting that told me ""I don't want to read this"" with dialog that made me want to close it.  Hope this is helpful in some way.  Don't have time to read this, but figured I've give this to you in case any of it is helpful.  As far as expanding things, I'll tell you one thing.  If you look at each major character, and put them through the ""hero's journey"" you can easily triple your page count.  I mean which characters don't YOU love?  If YOU don't love them, who will?  And if you don't, develop them to you do. Hating them is loving them too.  Every time I put a character through that I learn about them, I let them live their life.  Talk to each other.  And if I can't love or hate them, I ""select all, delete"" them and don't miss them."

Megan admires her new ring.  CLOSE ON MEGANS HAND     Megan (V.O) I never thought he'd give me a ring.  Would instead be  Megan admires her new RING on her HAND.  This way you're avoiding having to direct the explicit shot, and instead letting the reader's ""mind's eye"" create it.  And the assumption is the reader is going to be more qualified at creating that image than you.  Not because they're making your movie in their heads, but they're making their movie, from your words in their head.  So unless its totally necessary its supposed to be avoided.  Unless the shot is critical.  For example, I have one so far in about the same page count.  It involves an envelope in a car's glovebox, that is supposed to be read, but does not get read.  So there is a CU GLOVEBOX (HOLD) so that the mind's eye realizes this is an important detail and then they put it together in their head properly.  In that case, simply stating an ENVELOPE is PUT into the GLOVEBOX doesn't work because it doesn't drive home the point enough, that he should know about it and it is important.  The CU and HOLD are enough to drive that to the reader\viewer."

That way, I could see the movie in my head as I read the screenplay. It really helped me to get a better grasp of what a screenwriter's job is, and what it is not. I think that if I had not done this, I would have been too descriptive and controlling.  I didn't start out with specific questions in mind. I just wanted to read through several screenplays to build familiarity with the format. It helped to build my intuition when making stylistic choices.  As I worked through completing my first screenplay, I began to come across more specific questions. For example, I wanted to know the various ways one could format a flashback. I also needed to know the degree to which I ought to describe action scenes, specifically major fight and chase scenes. While googling those questions can lead to some solid information, I found that it was more beneficial for me to seek out screenplays of films that had strong flashbacks and action scenes. What I found was that many screenwriters make different choices. All of those choices are technically correct, but some pan out better than others. Comparing how each on-paper choice looked on the screen was very helpful."

Picking up a professional screenplay and reading it in this period is so illuminating because I have so many questions in my head and I get to see how this particular script answers them.   Its really hard to decipher whats good in a script. If it was easy, you could just read scripts then write a masterpiece. What I need to do is write and receive feedback on my own work AND read scripts while I'm doing this in order to have a relationship to the material (the professional screenplay) in order to extract value.   Its not all the time, but there will be these seeminlgy serendipitous moments where you have the right question in your head and you get the right answer from a professional screenplay where your hit with ""oh I get that thing now"" or, een if im not hit over the head with the insight, I deepen my relationship with the craft and what makes this so hard.

What I do is just skim them (maybe a favorite movie or a film I recently saw) and see if I can write or 'structuralize' something similar.  It's not so much about reading them as it is using them as guides (not unlike what an artist does w/ a reference photo).  Sometimes it helps.  Other times, it doesn't.  No matter what, you need to make it consistent with the rest of the screenplay.  Like, Picasso painted weird shapes but we understood that these weird shapes gave us the illusion of people.  It's sort of like that.  It's the art of being able to contextualize your random thoughts into one unifying format.  Otherwise, if you want to create memorable characters and quotes, go read it in a newspaper or try to read insights from your favorite comedian/philosopher/economist/etc....then, take what they say and try to contextualize it into your scene.

I'll describe the process below but admit first that I haven't really done this as many times with as many screenplays as I should have. But I am trying to do it now.  First, just read through the screenplay without doing any analysis, just get a feel for it and imagine the movie in your head.  Now go watch the movie, see how the words translate.  Now it's time for a proper analysis.  First break down the acts. Find the major beats of the story and how the connect to each other. Try to see the pattern of the different stories and how they intertwine and connect. Feel out the theme of the screenplay, what is it trying to say?  Next, break it down into sequences. These are roughly fifteen pages each. See how each has a beginning, middle and end. How the tension rises by the end. How do these knit together to form a compelling narrative.  Now drill down into each scene. Is it a little story all its own? Beginning, middle, end? What scenes move quickly, which ones drag. Does it hold your attention? How? Why?  What's the conflict in the scene? What does each character want from it? Who gets what they want and who doesn't? How does one character turn the situation in their favour? What is the relationship between the characters? How does this change?  Now the dialogue. What is said? What is meant? Where is the exposition hidden? How does each character speak that is unique to them?   There's more to look at and study but even the above is a lot of work. Good luck and happy learning."

You should also have 3-4 other ideas for episodes that you can talk about for a minute or two each. These should be TYPICAL episodes. The idea is to help buyers see that there's a show, here, not just a pilot.   The details of a lot of this will get hashed out in the writer's room, but it's also clear that on a lot of shows, the creators had some sense of the ending of the show when they started. e.g., they almost certainly didn't know how they were going to get there, but it's abundantly clear the guys who made How I Met Your Mother knew how they wanted to end it.   Meanwhile, a procedural show probably doesn't have a defined ending. Heck, plenty of sitcoms don't - I seriously doubt that the creators of Seinfeld or Cheers or Scrubs really thought that much about where they wanted to end the show before they started.   And this gets to why you think about this at the idea stage, not just once you're in a writers' room. e.g., part of the reason, in my opinion, HIMYM works so damn well is because a lot of that had been planned out, so they had a target. The seeds of that ending, the relationships that are going to carry us there, and the thematic material is all there in the first episode.   And that's, to my mind, what you should be thinking about even at the idea stage of your pilot: what is this show about, and how are these relationships going to illustrate that? I should finish reading your pilot and have a sense of the potential energy of the dominoes you've set up. You're only going to have that set-up if you have some sense of what you're setting up."
Screenwriting,3ag4jz,HotspurJr,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:51:04 2015 UTC,When?  When they are writing the pilot?  They don't.  When they've been picked up for a season by the network?  In the writers' room.
Screenwriting,3afhcp,FightingAgainstTime,3,Fri Jun 19 18:29:55 2015 UTC,"Good advice, especially the last point.  This isn't related to the writing, but the production value on Episode 10 was bad enough that it made it impossible for me to sit through. The episode 1 looks infinitely better...no matter the challenges capturing dialog.  If you're going to shoot on a green screen, you've got to make sure you pull a clean key, and the background plate has got to look believable (or completely abstract.)"
Screenwriting,3afhcp,joe12south,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:54:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100% - we're still very much in a learning process with the green screen and look forward to having more time to ""master"" it in our second season. The opportunity to use a massive green screen is such a blessing and a curse!  It's funny because there's such a disconnect between our audience (that we've received feedback from). They either were utterly impressed by the replicated plates or the fictional keys if they had no experience with filmmaking, or had 101 notes if they've ever worked with a green screen before. Interesting how it's harder to notice the artifice if you're outside of the field, eh?  Can I ask you this super specific question, which I have not yet made a decision about - would you find it jarring if our second season has an inconsistent blend of green screen episodes vs. more naturalistic episodes shot outside? There's going to be a visual difference no matter what because we're using the in-house cameras which are 720p at the moment."
Screenwriting,3afhcp,joe12south,2,Sat Jun 20 01:42:20 2015 UTC,"Not to be cruel, but I can't imagine anybody would not notice the shadows in episode 10. That's a really bad key. If you're going to pull working shadows, you must have the green screen flatly lit. This isn't hard to do, but you can't do it by eye. (And if you're not keying in After Effects, you really should. It's so much better than the tools in an NLE.)  In terms of mixing real sets with virtual sets...I'd find it jarring if it were obvious. If it was executed seamlessly, I'd never know. I'm not sure you're at that stage, though.  It seems to me what you want the audience to focus on is the content and the performance. Anything that distracts from that is a liability, in my book. I'd rather see two actors on a bare stage than against an obviously fake background.  I very much like the idea of using different ""steps"" in different real world locations. Kind of like Seinfeld's ""Comedians in Cars."""

Screenwriting,3agpiq,stubacca10,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:58:34 2015 UTC,"Personally hated the movie.  Came off as really pretentious given it was a ""pedo hunt"" movie, they never really did anything except pound that drum as hard as they could.  I thought they also did poor information management, essentially giving the movie away in the first couple minutes with the flash of that picture.  A lot of the scenes were extremely ""contrived"" and a lot of the dialog was poorly written.  My ultimate grudge with the movie was the omnipotence of the antagonist, the lack of good structure in the movie and just really writing a concept movie more than a movie.  We know nothing about either character essentially, no backstory about the ""victims"" etc.  I think if change the ""reason"" to something equally as heinous, but not pedophilic in nature, the movie would have been reviewed as one of the worst movies ever made."
Screenwriting,3agpiq,BradleyX,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:18:02 2015 UTC,"A lot of your gripes are what made the movie better IMO.  From mine and pretty much every perspective of others I've shown the movie to really didn't know who the real villain is until about the time he started stabbing the picture or painting or w/e it was (i forget).   So rather a straight forward pedo-hunt, I and many others weren't sure if she was an avenging vigilante stopping a monster or if he was a poor guy  wrongfully tortured by psycho bitch.  Knowing nothing of either character's background excels this. The story wasn't about the past, or the previous victims. It was about the present unfolding before us to eventually reveal which ""truth"" was reality. Is he the monster? Or is she mistaken?  And, I'd argue that the movie would work if it was about a rape & murder, too, if the pedo-angle was left out."

Screenwriting,3agpiq,MaybeCarl,2,Sat Jun 20 17:26:20 2015 UTC,"I've always liked Eric Edson's list for protagonist character traits. They don't have to be ""nice"", but if you can hit 5 or more of these, they'll usually get the audience to care enough to watch:   COURAGE. Not optional. Your lead has got to have guts. We identify more readily with flawed people, yes, but those flaws cannot include a lack of courage because only brave people take action, and only action can drive a story forward. UNFAIR INJURY. After courage, the second quickest way to bond a reader to your heroine is to place her at the outset in a situation where blatant injustice is being inflicted upon her. Few things stir our passions like injustice. Unfair Injury also demands that the heroine DO something in response – an excellent place to start any story. SKILL. We admire people who possess the grace, expertise, and mental acumen required to become masters of their chosen work. Doesn’t matter what your hero’s field of endeavor might be – tinker, tailor, CEO – as long as he’s expert at it. FUNNY. We warm to people who make us smile. We’re naturally drawn to folks with a humorous view of the passing parade. So if you can possibly bestow upon your hero a robust and playful sense of humor, do it. JUST PLAIN NICE. We can easily care about kind, decent, helpful, honest people, and we admire those who treat others well, relate with respect to people in humble walks of life, and who defend the weak or stand up for the helpless. ~Don't use this one for yours.~ IN DANGER. If when we first meet the heroine she’s already in a situation of real danger, it grabs our attention immediately. Danger means the imminent threat of personal harm or loss. What represents danger in any particular story depends on the scope of your tale. In fantasy, horror, and sci-fi it’s almost always the life or death kind. LOVED BY FRIENDS AND FAMILY. If we’re shown right off that the hero is already loved by other people, it gives us immediate permission to care about him, too. How many movies have you seen that begin with a surprise party thrown for the hero by a room full of adoring friends, or some other get-together taking place where affection gushes from a doting mom, dad, sibling, mate, child, or best friend? HARD WORKING. The heroines and heroes we care about have an enormous capacity for work. People who work hard create the energy needed to drive a story forward. OBSESSED. Obsession keeps brave, skilled, hard-working heroes focused on a goal, which is enormously important for any story. Driving obsession creates an active plot.   Personally, I don't think Walter White was ""likable"". But he still hits almost all these except 4 and 5, and fails in the end."

Screenwriting,3af5je,BoringPersonAMA,4,Fri Jun 19 18:36:06 2015 UTC,"I think that's a matter of taste. To me, as long as you care about what happens to the characters next and where they'll be by the end, you've got plenty of plot, and I think the Coens do accomplish that. Making more things happen to a character means you have less time to spend on the character's quirks and what makes them unique. Action heroes are broad and boring a lot of the time because so many things have to happen to them that character development takes a back seat (and that's not always a bad thing).

You have to consume A LOT of movies, and not just good ones.  Watch revered classics.  Watch box office hits.  Watch box office bombs.  Watch recent critical successes.  Watch terrible, awful movies.  If you truly love movies and want to achieve a deeper understanding of the art, there isn't a single movie that will ever waste your time. They're all educational experiences. You just have to know how to watch them.  What do you mean, ""how to watch them?""  I know that sounds pretentious, but hear me out.  I've been a musician for a long time. Started on piano, then sang in choirs. Eventually progressed to trumpet. Concert band, orchestra, jazz. Understanding how to read music changed the way I listen. It was like having x-ray hearing. I could hear different layers, and pick apart the details in my brain without consciously thinking about it. I often wonder how non-musicians hear music. Their ears are no different, but they lack the ability to process the incredible amount of data that's being thrown at them. It's not because they're stupid, they just haven't trained that particular muscle.  It's the same with movies. If you're not studying film theory in school, the easiest way to go deeper into film analysis would be to start watching movies on DVD or Blu-Ray with director and/or writer commentary. It's like watching movies with x-ray vision. Start with your favorite filmmakers. Their commentaries will reveal details you never noticed, and after a while, you'll start to notice them before they're ever mentioned. You'll feel like Neo at the end of The Matrix — like you're seeing the code.  I hope this helps. It's how I started in my teens. Thank god DVD came along when it did, otherwise I don't know where I'd be. DVD and Blu-Ray special features are an amazing resource."

I intend to read the Black Irish script tonight so can you keep it up for another 24 hours? And did you end up reworking it? I'd be interested to see how you took the comments on board."
Screenwriting,3aebyd,Asiriya,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:07:09 2015 UTC,I did end up reworking it a bit but I'm still not really happy with it. I got a reading from a very senior exec producer during the year and it made me rethink the entire plot of the pilot. I think now the Paris story is probably a mid-season ep or even a season finale (with a bit of punching up) but the pilot should have a plot that makes it easier to naturally introduce the characters and their world. So I'm thinking of having the pilot set in Ireland.  Anyway the most up-to-date version of Black Irish is here if you're interested. Would love to hear some thoughts!
Screenwriting,3aebyd,Asiriya,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:30:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll do my best to read it.  What did the exec say? How'd you get the meeting? Are you still UK based, someone here or in the US? (These questions and more in my next reply...)"
Screenwriting,3aebyd,IAmMostDispleased,2,Fri Jun 19 14:07:40 2015 UTC,Basically that she agreed with the Beeb notes (even after I tried to address them lol) and when I told her that I was thinking about restaging the pilot in Ireland she thought it was maybe a good idea.  I was working as as the writer's assistant on a drama she was producing.  I am still UK based (Belfast to be precise).

Screenwriting,3aeeqs,MrGCar,2,Fri Jun 19 13:19:31 2015 UTC,"Hmm, the first thing that came to my mind is Slaughterhouse Five. It's a similar type of story and the transitions in time are just stated. In script format for example:  INT. DON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1963)  Don kisses his wife on the forehead and walks over to the restroom, but as soon as he enters we are in  EXT. IWO JIMA FRONT LINE - MORNING (1945)  Don is in full combat gear and looks around, dumbfounded.  This would be like that book because it took movements in one time period as opportunities to be transitions to another period. I'd recommend something like this and if the dates vary enough you could add in on screen text with the year and location. But that's more story specific so I can't comment on that.  Hopefully some of this might point you in the right direction, cheers!"

Screenwriting,3adfc4,Lambroghini,9,Fri Jun 19 05:33:27 2015 UTC,"I went back to school for film after realizing I hated working in my first two majors respective fields. If you love film and want to give it a shot, then that's basically all you need. Won't tell you if you'll love working in it. It's a tough industry, but if you're passionate about it then go for it. I now live in LA (fulfilled lifelong dream of living in California) and have worked in many roles in the industry but most enjoy development and script consulting as I still have time and energy to write and be creative. Working production is fun but can be pretty rough at times (very long hours, on your feet, sometimes harsh working conditions) and producing is a royal pain, but still kind of a rush. Directing can be fun if you like working with actors, but it's a lot different than most non filmmakers would imagine. Post is more office/tech based, usually more corporate and can be chill although lots of deadlines. Writing is a different experience for everyone, most writers I know love/hate it, and until you break in you'll probably need a day job, preferably something that doesn't zap your energy or mentally exhaust you. Most of the other jobs are labor intensive trades (art, wardrobe, cinematography, g&e etc.) personally I hated working in management and agencies seem similar. Studio jobs are prime for good pay and benefits with out crazy hours, but most roles are playing a small part in a bigger picture. Reality jobs suck IMO. Indy side sucks unless you are really passionate about it. Lots of shady indy jobs with unpaid overtime or all in flat rates, chasing down payments, skeezy producers, etc. but there are some good indy jobs too. Commercial gigs usually have best pay for production outside of union jobs. All of it is a hustle. That's just LA and ymmv but overall it's been worth it for me."
Screenwriting,3adfc4,beardsayswhat,-1,Fri Jun 19 06:00:00 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that you bring up LA and I love all of your input into every aspect. It was really a helpful insight. The part about LA though. It's not exactly on top of my ""I want to live here"" list. I realize that's where the work is and most of the industry but I couldn't imagine living my life there. I really want to have a family wife kids the whole nine yards. I definitely don't want to raise my children there. This could just be my diluted Indiana view on the city but it doesn't seem like a place I want to have my kids grow up in. I would however love to live in NYC or somewhere in the pacific northwest Seattle or near the coast of Oregon. Is it possible to work in the industry and not live in LA? Or at least not be there permanently?"

Screenwriting,3adfc4,Lambroghini,0,Fri Jun 19 06:20:38 2015 UTC,No. I know my thoughts on it could be completely changed in the next 4 years. And after one visit I might love it.
Screenwriting,3adfc4,beardsayswhat,11,Fri Jun 19 06:24:51 2015 UTC,"I would, in general, avoid disparaging places you've never been.  I'm sure you don't appreciate when people denigrate the place you call home without having experienced it, and those of us that call LA home don't much appreciate being told the place we live and work in isn't a place fit to raise kids.  I mostly say this so that because I see a lot of young film school kids who are visiting LA for internships say they could never live in such a terrible place, and immediately the brains of the professionals turn off, because it's essentially a big middle finger to their life choices.  It's not a smart career move."

On the other hand if you're shit talking Indiana I would just join right because these corn fields get pretty boring and awful after awhile. Not to mention our terrible politics and horribly backward bible thumping ways. At the same time though I do understand what you mean. This is just me being a person from a town of 6,000 and never being to any city other then Indy a handful of times. From my limited knowledge it's a no go for a family.

Screenwriting,3adfc4,Lookout3,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:42:14 2015 UTC,Just the city atmosphere. Growing up around extremely privileged kids. Not knowing what people from other places would consider to be the real world. I'm just really afraid of raising kids who's grown up around others who's parents got them brand new cars when they hit 16 and have no concept of how to work for what you want things like that. But I've also been homeless before and lived pretty deep in poverty since I was 14. I'm only 18 now but I've already gotten enough of a taste of harsh the world can be in just those four years that I feel it's made a much better person then I would've been without those experiences. I just don't want my kids to grow up me raising them where they have to work for their own after they hit a certain age and begin to either A hate me for it because theyre friends have everything under the sun or B become the self entitled people I loathe due to their environment. Like I said before though. I've never been to a wealthy city before so I have no first hand experience.

Fine, and it probably is good advice. But to then actively be insulted is just ridiculous.   It works for you, the guy is talking from ignorance but I think its fair to evaluate your position as an unknown writer, look at the cost of living in the city and then say that living in LA would be terrible. Because not having money in an expensive city is tough and not for everyone. Because wanting to make films doesn't mean that the pervasive politics of the city is welcome. Etc."

Screenwriting,3adfc4,Lambroghini,-1,Fri Jun 19 16:24:16 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, he's replied more now so I see that.  You've said before that everyone in LA is in the industry or knows someone that is. Going from that, I can imagine it being difficult knowing that anyone you know could be related to your work and change the way you behave as a result.   I take everything personally.   That does sound unhealthy, especially if it riles you up someone bad-mouthing LA. I'm more worried that someone is capable of reacting badly to a naive person's opinion than that a naive person is... naive."

Not planning on staying here forever. May move to Pasadena or a bit out of LA soon. I now mostly work from home. I know some people that moved to NYC and work production there, but for writing, most advice I've seen is you need to be in LA for meetings, which seems to be true from what I've seen. Granted I'm now pursuing music as my end game, and not trying to be a staffed writer, but I do write because I enjoy it and work with a lot of writers, including a couple that have ""broken in"".

It's its own beast, with its own set of rules (which are breakable, once you get really good).  Just remember that before Picasso developed his cubist style, he was a master of older styles.  I say that not to dissuade you, but to tell you that to get good at any kind of writing, a simple love is not nearly enough. It takes hard work, blood, sweat, tears and heartbreak."

That doesn't mean you shouldn't pursue screenwriting and directing but you should really do your due diligence before you put all your eggs into one basket. Coming out of school with a ton of debt and no viable skills is a killer.

You can have as low as 7 or as many as 12 sequences.  8 is a good general number to know you've got enough to probably start writing, but there's nothing magical about it.  The point is to start thinking in sequences when breaking a story, in general."

Screenwriting,3acw20,simon2it,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:34:49 2015 UTC,"I can't agree with this more.  Take a look at the site and see how they do it, then do it yourself.  Take a movie on the list that you've seen, break it down, then compare it to how the site broke it down.  Figuring it out for yourself is going to be very valuable in the long run."
Screenwriting,3acw20,cbatower,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:33:48 2015 UTC,"The way we learn to do something, is to see how it's done. First, you need to understand what is meant by ""sequence"" and how people who understand that and have experience, break down a film. Then, you can do that yourself.   You can also go about doing everything yourself, hit-and-miss, trial-and-error, reinventing the wheel, taking ten times as long to reach even a basic level of understanding and be making fundamental errors that become ingrained in your worldview.  You can decide no one has anything to teach you that you cannot learn for yourself.   Whatever works for you."

Screenwriting,3ablec,icantfindafuckinname,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:47:58 2015 UTC,I think it is important to keep the story clean. By that I mean everything you write has to have a purpose. Unnecessary character depth and development only distracts the audience when it just exits to fill the script. Complex stories are great but simple stories can do the job just as fine.
Screenwriting,3ablec,DickHero,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:28:59 2015 UTC,Disagree.  Plot is an illusion that arises from character and conflict. Calling a plot simple is (really) a comment on the character and conflict.

The biggest disappointment in the film is the CEO killed in the helicopter crash. His arc went nowhere. It would be like if Hammond in the original film was killed by a velociraptor while eating icecream in the dining room and Ellie flees back to the control room.
Screenwriting,3af72x,oamh42,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:55:49 2015 UTC,"I really liked the movie, I think I would've just made a few adjustments in dialogue and the like but even that I feel is a little overconfident on my part. I think the Lex and Tim connection would be cool but I don't see them wanting to get involved with the park ever again. It was a traumatizing experience for everyone involved. And also, there's the question of the timeline. The movie doesn't say how long has it been since Hammond died, but given that in The Lost World he didn't seem interested in inheriting the park to Lex and Tim, I don't know how he could've changed his mind.   Anyway, a while ago Max Landis had been mentioning what he would've done and although I don't think these changes had been necessary, I think they would've made the film slightly different. He didn't completely say this, so I'm adding to it a bit. One is that Owen isn't involved in the marines, but instead an animal trainer of some sort or if they needed the military connection, probably someone who started out as a cop dog or CBP dog trainer and then went up into the military, only to get involved with raptor training for InGen. Someone who probably picked up a few tricks here and there from soldiers and his friends, but that otherwise is very inexperienced in combat or using weapons, so when confronting the I-Rex and the raptors, he's almost making it up as he goes along.   And another, slightly more radical idea would've been actually trying to save the park, which I'm a little iffy about. He didn't elaborate, but I guess the moment it all completely goes to hell is when the aviary is destroyed. I think it would've been a cool twist if they had managed to keep it all under wraps while the tourists have no idea that people are trying to save their lives, but I think that at the end of the movie, the park would've still been closed or endangered somehow. Unless NO ONE died getting the I-Rex, the park  would still be fucked and given the nature of the characters, I don't think they would've stayed quiet about it. You have different sections of the staff who have been eaten or killed, leading to an audit that would've closed the park at least temporarily. It's still a cool idea, but one where I can't think of a satisfying execution."
Screenwriting,3af72x,oamh42,2,Fri Jun 19 18:10:47 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest issue with saving the park is trying to revisit it yet again in a sequel. I think Jurassic Park and Jurassic World covered those angles.   I'm guessing Jurassic World 2 will be very much like The Lost World,  but with dinos trained to be weapons, and more spliced creatures.   The military goes in to clear out the Dino island and is met with a Frankenstein version of The Lost World?    I think in the end the movie made the right call by having the park crash and burn. It was a great follow up to Jurassic Park and finished the ""What if"" that had been hanging in the air for 20 years."
Screenwriting,3af72x,oamh42,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:35:34 2015 UTC,"I agree. Before Jurassic World had been decided upon as the approach for a 4th Jurassic Park film, I thought up an idea of what I'd do that I think could be adapted into a fifth film: The movie would open like the first novel, with Compys attacking children in the mainland but also with Pterosaurs showing up on the rooftops of suburban houses in the US, maybe in different parts of the world.   All of the main characters from the other movies (Grant, Malcolm, Owen and Claire) would get together to collaborate to figure out what is going on, along with some new characters. I'm picturing a scene where InGen wants to sent a dinosaur from one point of the world into another and they have to either prevent the plane (or boat) from taking off or hijack it to deviate its course. Maybe they'd use Pterosaurs for that : p   But in the end, it'd become the equivalent of a zombie movie with people fighting off the dinosaurs with the barest of elements."

Screenwriting,3af72x,Psyladine,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:34:58 2015 UTC,"My biggest problems were with the development of the main characters. Chris Pratt's character was an amazing animal trainer because he spent time in the Navy? That makes no sense. Give him a real backstory. Make him a safari guy. Indiana Jones was an archeologist. Dr. Grant in the first film was a palaeontologist. It made sense as to why he was there. In this film we aren't given any explanation why his character is there or why he seems to know so much about training reptiles.   My other big problem was Vincent D'Onofrio's character. He worked security for the park and wanted to weaponize them to sell them or something? I wasn't really clear of his motivation. It really made no sense. Since they weren't on US soil, why would the US military be involved? You make him an employee of the nearby South American warlord or dictator. Someone that would see vicious dinosaurs as an attractive weapon. The US government doesn't need dinosaurs.   I had a lot of other issues with the film, like the meaningless divorce, the annoying kids, the plotlines that went nowhere. And do we really need a super dinosaur? You'd think that dinosaurs by themselves are cool enough."

Obviously,  that is me plugging holes for the writers. I doubt you get chosen as a Dino trainer cause you were a mechanic in the Navy,  but yeah, not much of a helpful backstory.   I also didn't really buy the security guy's story. He seemed to want to impress someone that the dinosaurs could be used as weapons... but then,  basically takes over the entire operation at will. I'm not really sure who he was trying to impress at that point. Seemed like he owned or had a, hand in everything he wanted/needed.   If they were going to go with the weaponization of the dinos for a sequel, then I would have had him call another facility on the other side of the island to wrap it up and show them getting lots of crazy looking creatures (obviously quite young still) out of pens - that would have been a bigger teaser for a sequel than gathering lots of test tubes...

Screenwriting,3acxfa,Asiriya,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:50:24 2015 UTC,"Hyperlink cinema:       Hyperlink cinema is a term coined by author Alissa Quart, who used the term in her review of the film Happy Endings (2005) for the film journal Film Comment in 2005.  Film critic Roger Ebert popularized the term when reviewing the film Syriana in 2005.  These films are not hypermedia and do not have actual hyperlinks, but are multilinear in a more metaphorical sense.  In describing Happy Endings, Quart considers captions acting as footnotes and split screen as elements of hyperlink cinema and notes the influence of the World Wide Web and multitasking.  Playing with time and characters' personal history, plot twists, interwoven storylines between multiple characters, jumping between the beginning and end (flashback and flashforward) are also elements.  Ebert further describes hyperlink cinema as films where the characters or action reside in separate stories, but a connection or influence between those disparate stories is slowly revealed to the audience; illustrated in Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu's films Amores perros (2000), 21 Grams (2003), and Babel (2006).    Quart suggests that director Robert Altman created the structure for the genre and demonstrated its usefulness for combining interlocking stories in his films Nashville (1975) and Short Cuts (1993).  She also mentions the television series 24 and discusses Alan Rudolph’s film Welcome to L.A. (1976) as an early prototype.  Crash (2004) is an example of the genre, as are Steven Soderbergh's Traffic (2000), City of God (2002), Syriana (2005), and Nine Lives (2005).

When you haven't written for a while your skills naturally degrade a little, as does your confidence and then it can be really hard to face that blank page. I've been there plenty of times and it's easy to get paralysed by the idea that what you do might not be good enough.  There are a few solutions to this that go hand in hand.   Firstly, give yourself permission to write rubbish. There are very few writers in this world who produce great work in the first draft. So take that pressure off yourself. You'll be rewriting it anyway. Ravindranath Tagore who won a Nobel prize for gitanjali (I believe) re-wrote that thousand page manuscript nine times. On an old fashion type writer.  Secondly, the only thing that can solve writers block is writing. Just sit down and start writing the story you want to tell. Doesn't matter if it's crap. Just write it and you will soon get into the flow. I know this is hard to believe when you're stuck like this but it's really the only way.  Last and not least. Re-discover your love of reading. Whatever genre it is you enjoy just read, let the joy of story and narrative suffuse your blood once more and you'll find yourself getting excited about stories again. Because isn't that what inspired you to begin with? Reading and watching great stories and feeling like you had something to add to this collective knowledge sharing exercise of the human diaspora?"

The world for these individuals may be infinitely rich, rewarding and seductive—but it is not paramount. The world may be interpreted as a gift, earned only if one has created something over and above the world.'"

One time might help a little, but doing it day after day for a while will get me feeling better.   Often, I think blocks have most to do with a person's set of beliefs about themselves or their writing. If you're observant and connected to the world around you there's a ton of things you can grab from and be inspired. It might be good to just start asking some basic questions of yourself, then digging deeper.  Ex) How seriously do you take writing?   A: very (are you beating yourself up, thinking negatively all the time because you're not where you think you should be?)   A: not very (are you too lax/inconsistent in your approach? Are you putting too many things in the way of having creative space and time?)  Bottom line is this: A lot of the people I see who are blocked seem to have beliefs that are holding them back more than any other factors such as a lack of story to tell. When someone believes the stories they tell (and their skill/talent/craft) have value, they will be motivated, energized, and inspired. When they don't have belief in themselves or their potential, there is no point to ever start writing or stick with a story all the way through, and so, they wont."

They would throw out a line of dialogue they’d heard somebody say or that someone had said to them—and that was the story. I did not know how important that shit was. There’s an episode where Beansie and Paulie are reminiscing and Tony dismissively says, “‘Remember when’ is the lowest form of conversation.” And it’s devastating. David Chase had witnessed that actual statement. Now I have a ton of stuff like that I’ve saved, things people have said to me that are concise and devastating and sum up some moment in their lives.

If that's what writers expected from themselves, they'd all have writer's block.   So sit down and write. Force yourself. Writing total garbage is way better than writing nothing.

There's a Slugline free trial by the way: http://slugline.co/   Is it worth it to get one of these 2 programs or does google docs or notepad suffice?   As your main program, you may be happier with one of the two because they're built for the task, but they're not essential. You will have to use something to get a formatted script at the end of it all, but there are quite a few alternatives including those two: http://fountain.io/apps   Side note: For those that have transitioned to fountain text, What do you like about it over using a traditional screenwriting program with formatting?

A cut is a cut; saying that it ""smashes"" the audience in the face is just on-page arrogance, as if you can't help but call attention to how punchy the cut you just wrote is."
Screenwriting,3a9yb8,40dollarsharkblimp,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:49:19 2015 UTC,"You have no idea what you are talking about. A smash cut causes the audience on purpose to notice the edit point, normally because we are moving to a new time and location. One easy way to do that is to use the audio from the incoming scene as the audio on the cut point. For example, we throw some guy in a trunk for saying dumb stuff, and we slam the trunk then SMASH TO dumping his body in a river.  edit, forgot to mention hard cut: this is in distinction to a dissolve or some kind of wipe."
Screenwriting,3a9yb8,DickHero,2,Thu Jun 18 19:54:36 2015 UTC,"So how do you explain that Google search? Apparently, it's not just me, but every single screenwriting blog/expert/website on the internet that has ""no idea what [we're] talking about."""
Screenwriting,3a9yb8,40dollarsharkblimp,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:12:18 2015 UTC,Most information about screenwriting on the Internet is extremely outdated or flat out wrong.
Screenwriting,3a9yb8,Lookout3,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:17:06 2015 UTC,"Screenwriting experts who don't know what a smash cut is are not film editors and have no experience in post, so they're wise to avoid using words they don't know. I do know and can cut the film too. If the screenplay says SMASH TO, then I will."
Screenwriting,3a9yb8,DickHero,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:20:45 2015 UTC,"Calling attention to how punchy the smash cut happens to be is entirely the point of a smash cut.

It's really easy to see people saying this and to find validation for bad habits:  ""Hey, I CAN use smash cuts! That's what I thought! MY script uses them on every page because it's necessary!""  The fact is that smash cuts are unfashionable; that's not an arguable point. The rules are guidelines, yes, but you should still follow them 90% of the time. People can say all they want that there are ""no rules"" when it comes to formatting, but I'm betting they still submit their scripts in some form of Courier...  edit: You're also missing my point about smash cuts. There's no need to call attention to it. If your cut is punchy, it's already there in the script. The smash has added nothing but a nudge and a wink."

Every superhero movie is packed full of smash cuts. It's like the producer is standing behind the editor saying, ""Make that cut bigger."" And now I can't resist a joke: Hulk Smash! haha!  For me, CUT TO and SMASH TO (and any transition really) is more akin to a putting salt and pepper on. It's for flavor to taste.

Every time I do I see the same people I couldn't stand from University arguing against rules and not understanding conventions in screenwriting are like conventions everywhere else.  We don't loudly declare at the top of our voice when think about sex in public. We could, of course, but it would probably limit our career options.  Similarly, like the Coen Brothers breaking conventions or whatever naff argument is in vogue, Louis CK or a famous comedian probably could shout about every boner and pull it off.  You, however, cannot, little screenwriting newbie."
Screenwriting,3a9yb8,Warlach,2,Thu Jun 18 18:46:36 2015 UTC,"Yup. I think it's incredibly unhelpful when these successful guys come out and talk about how all the rules are bullshit and a good writer will always make it, etc.  Oftentimes, telling someone to ignore the rules prematurely is what will prevent them from ever becoming a good writer in the first place. It's the same thing in literature: imagine a first-time author trying to pull off dialogue without quotation marks or tags. Sure, Cormac McCarthy has done it, but that doesn't mean you should."
Screenwriting,3a9yb8,40dollarsharkblimp,3,Thu Jun 18 21:30:30 2015 UTC,"You are looking at it all backwards. My ""the rules are bullshit"" attitude is WHY I am a professional writer, not something I get away with because I am one."

If it's a great script, it'll show through!""  But we're talking about Cut Tos here. Basically it's a stylistic choice like a chef deciding he wants to decorate your steak with a parsley sprig. No one's going to throw out the steak because of the parsley, and no one's going to love the steak if it's overcooked just because there was parsley. But someone might say ""hey, that parsley garnish was a nice touch."" It's not some super pretentious device that's reserved only for the Coen Brothers and Beardsayswhat."
Screenwriting,3a9yb8,satanabduljabar,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:45:24 2015 UTC,Seeing CUT TO multiple times on a page is equivalent to seeing huge blocks of description or parentheticals on every line of dialogue. It's just not aesthetically pleasing to the reader's eye.   I don't know about that. I'm completely fine with them.
Screenwriting,3a9yb8,Slickrickkk,2,Fri Jun 19 01:30:49 2015 UTC,"The simplest answer: There's no rule. Some screenwriters will use it to draw attention to the rhythm of a cut.  Anderson doesn't always include a cut to: before scene headings, but when a jump cut will be used in the film to create comedy, drama, or a distinct sense of rhythm, he calls attention to it.  Ultimately, it's left up to your discretion. You don't have to use CUT TO: at all if you don't want to. Placing a CUT TO: between every scene is unnecessary and sort of antiquated. A lot of writers find a balance. I use it very infrequently."
Screenwriting,3a9yb8,thetravisnewton,2,Thu Jun 18 13:13:02 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with that.    Don't be the boy who cried wolf or else the handful (or more) times you want to use it for comedic/dramatic effect, the reader will likely be skimming past them because you used them between every scene.  Use them when it makes sense, lose them when it doesn't."
Screenwriting,3a9yb8,COL2015,2,Thu Jun 18 16:22:03 2015 UTC,"The way I use Cut To is to signal a change in plotlines. So, for instance, I'm following Bob around for three scenes, all of which involve different locations, times etc. I figure the slugline already tells me the change in all that info, so why be redundant? But if I'm goingfrom a Bob Scene to a Sally scene, I'll use Cut To to punctuate a change in plot thread. It helps me the reader to know when I'm jumping around in the story at a quick glance.   Honestly, there's no wrong way of using it and really depends on what you're doing. Its a style thing so do what makes sense to you."
Screenwriting,3a9yb8,Tredronerath,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:52:00 2015 UTC,"Personally, I use it to interchange perspective with characters in the same scene.  For example, if I have two characters that are separated from one another in an action scene that takes place in the same location, like a protagonist and antagonist,  I'll use CUT TO to shift the reader's perspective between each character.  I found that without these transitions, it can be difficult to follow the action of the scene. It's just a nice way to organize your prose based on the actions of whichever character you're following at that point in time.   In the end, if it helps the reader move their eyes down the page, and you stay consistent in your use of it throughout the script, you should be fine. Just be sure to use it sparingly."
Screenwriting,3a9yb8,dpergs4,3,Thu Jun 18 23:46:29 2015 UTC,"current industry practice is not to use any camera instructions (cuts, angles, etc.) unless the screenwriter is also the director or cinematographer. Camera instructions limit the director's discretion. Directors will simply ignore them or, worse, think the screenwriter is overstepping.   Sorry, but this is a myth and it needs to die.  We are writing movies, not documents. A screenplay should give someone an approximation of what it's like to watch a movie. If it's necessary to call out angles to understand the action as you see it, even if you're not gonna be the director, do it. Just don't overdo it. When you're writing a script on spec, you're writing a movie. Your movie. The only person directing that movie in your head is YOU. Write it as you see it. Just don't bog your reader down in minutiae.  This draft of 'The Conjuring' by the Hayes Brothers (not the shooting script, and untouched by director James Wan) does a good job of describing how we see the images they've created, without ever getting lost in the little details of how the camera moves."

Screenwriting,3aesoq,nitrohawk91,5,Fri Jun 19 15:37:52 2015 UTC,Medellin was a great film and Vinnie Chase did a good job with the accent. I think most people found his accent off-putting by virtue of the fact it was Vinnie Chase saying the words and audiences weren't willing to accept him in that role.  Sometimes great films are forged in difficult and trying shoots. Medellin is essentially this generations Apocalypse Now. Plus it had an ironic ascension threaded throughout the story.   What are you main objections to Medellin?

Read any of his scripts (Your Bridesmaid is a Bitch, Worst Honeymoon Ever, Jane Got A Gun, The Babysitter, Monster Problems etc.) and you will see what I mean. It's not as strong as Dan Gilroy, but it still really adds to the whole thing. But as u/Ragesome said, I too wouldn't recommend the use of it, until you really know what you're doing in terms of craft. I would say it's especially useful in spec scripts, because you have to stand out and that can be (besides a flawless craft and a great concept and story) one aspect that helps a lot."

Screenwriting,3a8zme,Ragesome,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:45:36 2015 UTC,Yes I agree.  The script yelled at you when it wanted to and it whispered to you when it wanted you to listen.

It would have become too much if it was a spectacle script where the continuous action would have just been a headache to read for a hundred pages.

Screenwriting,3ab3vn,paperfisherman,0,Thu Jun 18 21:59:05 2015 UTC,why not an act? three act structure is an imaginary construct.  what do you need to describe it for?
Screenwriting,3ab3vn,Asiriya,3,Thu Jun 18 18:17:52 2015 UTC,"Well I've hit a snag.   Working on an epic scifi/fantasy adventure. Worked my outline 'till I was satisfied with the results, and I've been happily writing for almost three weeks.   My act break was at around the 40ish mark or so. But today, today I'm sitting pretty at 114 pages... And I haven't even gotten halfway through the first half of my second act.  The reason? When I outlined, I wrote down the various encounters my heroes would be facing, things like: They fight a giant robot, escape a city filled with giant spiders, etc. The problem is that I did not take into account that these, ""sequences"" were huge (in comparison to just one scene). About 10-15 pages each.   Also, I wasn't taking into account that with them being so large, it wasn't enough to just shove a 5 page scene of downtime in between. There had to be more of a break or the action would just lose its edge. Get repetitive.  Now the reason I came here to ask this is I was trying to figure out how many of these, ""sequences"" were in Fellowship's second act. I wanted to compare since I'm shooting for a similar runtime.   From how it's looking, I've got some serious trimming to do. Fellowship doesn't have that many action set pieces in the first half of its second act (10-15ers). I have at least six. So yeah, beginner's oversight, that'll need fixing."
Screenwriting,3ab3vn,Asiriya,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:43:26 2015 UTC,"Now the reason I came here to ask this is I was trying to figure out how many of these, ""sequences"" were in Fellowship's second act. I wanted to compare since I'm shooting for a similar runtime.    What might help you is to think of Act II as actually consisting of two parts, itself, like in the 8-sequence method.  Some list it as ""Rising Action - Positive"" and ""Rising Action - Negative"".  Here's my interpretation of Fellowship's second act, assuming it starts when Frodo leaves the Shire:  Rising Action, pt. 1  1) Escaping the Ringwraiths on their way to Bree  2) Attack at Weathertop/Rescue by Arwen  3) Rivendell/Seeing Bilbo/Fellowship formed  Rising Action, pt. II  5) Pass of Caradhras/Saruman's Blizzard  6) Mines of Moria/Khazad-Dûm/Gandalf's Death  7) Lotholórien/Galadriel  So the two parts of Act II both essentially follow a: Travel/Chase + Big Action Sequence + Elves Exposition Dump.  Then you have Act III, which consists of Boromir's temptation/the Breaking of the Fellowship, the climactic battle at Amon Hen, and Boromir's death."
Screenwriting,3ab3vn,Asiriya,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:57:21 2015 UTC,"Or just four acts. Frodo drives the narrative in the first film, his decisions propelling the plot and those around him. So the first act is up to Frodo's decision to leave the Shire. Then up to his decision to carry the Ring. Then until he sunders the Fellowship. And act four is a very short demonstration of the ramifications of his choice."
Screenwriting,3ab3vn,magelanz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:19:42 2015 UTC,"That sounds very close to what I was thinking (not to mention it's very well structured).   To compare that to what I was doing in my script would look something like:  Rising Action, pt. I   Joining the (heroes' military branch)/training in special armor Attack from a wandering, giant, robot. Escaping the city filled with spiders Finding an abandoned outpost where they meet a new member of the group. Going to that new members city, to find out where to go next. Passing through another city, fighting aquatic wildlife and zombies. Finally getting to where they need to get to/midpoint   Rising Action, pt. II  (I'm not sure how many sequences I had for the second half of act II, but it's got to be about the same as in the first.)  So looking back, waaaay too many sequences."

Screenwriting,3a8eru,SirRollsaSpliff,3,Thu Jun 18 19:56:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry, repost of a previous response to this, but my two cents...   Like these guys have posted, it was a first draft, so you have to take it with a grain of salt… that being said, it is a great first draft, but still disappointing. Tarantino promised this epic western, or a true western, and it really seems more like a less intense version of Reservoir Dogs set in the old west. As you'd expect with Tarantino, the dialogue is phenomenal, the characters are colorful and interesting and he does a wonderful job of peeling back the layers of the story onion to reveal more about them, although none of them are very likable, and you have no idea who to root for…. I guess that's where the actors come in.  Despite this, very little to nothing happens, especially in the first 80 pages, and by the time something does happen, it seems far too sudden. The conclusion was underwhelming at best, I finished the script and said, ""so what?""… why did I just read 160 pages of plot that could have been easily fit into a 10 minute short story. Had this been submitted under a different pseudonym, if it wasn't Tarentino's name behind it, I strongly believe studios would pass on it or want heavy rewrites. Once again though, this is Tarentino and it was only a first draft and I believe it will get better on the second, third, fourth draft."
Screenwriting,3a8eru,SirRollsaSpliff,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:01:41 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I am a fan of Tarantino, but his script lengths are incredibly long. Knowing it is a first draft, and as others have pointed out, will be changed, I will probably read this bearing in mind this is the movie he would have made 2 years ago, and not the movie coming out at the end of the year."
Screenwriting,3a8eru,SirRollsaSpliff,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:10:53 2015 UTC,"No, I understand what you are saying, but if this hadn't of been leaked, he still would've rewritten it. The dude is more neurotic about his scripts being perfect before anyone sees it than almost anyone. He wants them to be their own complete work of art that would stand on its own without an film... That's why he was so upset, he felt like it was unfinished and a violation of his privacy to leak it publicly when it's very clear that changes still needed to be made."

It gives you a good look at how a master screenwriter tells his visual story in the written form.

Screenwriting,3a8eru,goofball_jones,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:36:01 2015 UTC,"I read it and enjoyed it as a study piece but was kind of disappointed on a few levels. First of all, I don't think that Tarentino's visual flair translates at all to the page. It was a first draft and maybe it was purposely left out but aside form the description that it would be shot on ""glorious 70mm"" (or however he described it), I didn't get a sense for how this film would actually look.   Secondly, it found it to be a little dull in the sense that I didn't really care about the characters. Nobody has a real redeeming quality and there's no sense of why I should be invested in these people's storylines.  That being said, though, I'm a HUGE Tarentino fan and I don't think that this screenplay is really representative of what will be the finished film. Also, and this is very much worth mentioning, I've read several other Tarentino screenplays and they actually end up being VERY different from the page to the screen. Kill Bill and Inglorious Basterds come to mind. Google those screenplays and compare it to the finished product. You'd be surprised how much is changed for the finished movie.  I think one of the main things to remember is that Tarentino is a writer AND a director. I think that it is valuable for screenwriters to buy a camera (even just a cheap handheld or dSLR) and take a shot at directing a few pages of their projects. It really gives you a sense of what works and doesn't in terms of storytelling, dialogue, setting, pace, tone, really everything. Also, you may find that you enjoy filming as well as writing and then, suddenly, you've added a valuable skill set to your repertoire.   I forgot where I read this but there's an interview where Spike Lee says that one of the best things you can do to get into the industry is be something AND something else. Be a writer AND a director. Or be a writer AND a cameraman. Diversify your skill set and you'll be more valuable to people in the long run. Tarentino clearly has built up a lot of cachet in the industry and he can submit mediocre scripts that will get funding but that's because he is a screenwriter AND a director. What is on the page isn't necessarily what you'll see on the screen and he probably knows that going in. His ""vision"" probably isn't fully formed until he's in the editing room and the screenplay just serves as a skeleton for what he wants to do.  Sorry for the ramble, I hope it all made sense."

I mean, you won't hurt yourself by sending an email, but you're not doing anything either. Here's the thing:  If he wants it, he'll let you know.  As a rule of thumb, you want to get to the point where you consider submissions ""fire and forget"" - the vast majority of submissions (even those by professional writers) go nowhere and take forever. It's not worth it to be on pins and needles about it.   It might be worth an email a month or two later just to make sure they didn't forget about you, but chances are if they want you, they'll let you know."

Screenwriting,3a86jp,DankOwl,10,Thu Jun 18 00:03:35 2015 UTC,"This is the script code for the studio's reference. The episode title and writer credit may change multiple times throughout the process of making an episode, so there needs to be an unchanging designation for production use, for example on set blueprints, guest cast contracts, studio and network notes, writers' residual eligibility stuff.  Also, a TV script is a distinct thing seperate to an episode - studios and networks can order scripts with or without a commitment to actually produce them. Sometimes a new show will sell to a network and require a minimum number of scripts to be ordered on the first season, but that the network need only follow a smaller number of episodes through to completion. On the secondary market, scripts can be re-sold, for instance for a foreign re-make. Obviously studios need to have an easy way to keep track of all this.  04 - This is the studio's code for the show, in this case Seinfeld. By inference, we can assume that Seinfeld was the fourth TV project developed by Castle Rock Entertainment that got as far as the script stage. Studios with much higher output have more complex alpha-numeric codes. Even unsold or unproduced pilots get a show code, because you never know when you might want to revive an old idea (like CBS Studios finding an old Vince Gilligan pilot down the back of the sofa after he made Sony a lot of money with Breaking Bad).  05 - The contractual season of that show that this script was ordered within. Note this may not always be the season it is intended to air in. A season is an important unit of measurement. With each season, writer pay and seniority usually increases, and certain contractual aspects such as the % of residuals or profit participation may change. But for writers that is calculated for the season the script was ordered in, not when it was made or transmitted.  Just before the last writers' strike, some networks and studios ordered scripts intended for airing at the beginning of the following season in order to build up a stockpile so they had more chance of hitting a fall premiere should the strike drag on.  03 - This is obviously then the script number. Again, scripts may be ordered at any time, and the script number is first-come-first-served. The script number doesn't necessarily match up to the order in which the episode will air, nor does it necessarily match the order in which the writers intend the episode to air. It's just literally the first script to get officially started, then the next and the next. If your script gets pushed further back in the season while you're half-way through writing it, that doesn't affect your script number.  So #04-0503 is the third script ordered during the fifth season of Seinfeld."
Screenwriting,3a86jp,listyraesder,2,Thu Jun 18 03:53:37 2015 UTC,"0503 is the production code.  I'm not sure about the #04, but if I had to guess, it would be draft number."

They just have to be ideas for movies. Put that list away. Come back the next day and look at the list. You should find 2-3 good ideas in there. Flesh out those ideas and come up with another 10 ideas for movies. Put that away. Come back the next day and reread those.

Make sure you are CONVINCED, though - no point throwing 20 pages into the back of the filing cabinet, where you may never see it again, over something that could be fixed with a minor tweak.  Do NOT throw away your work.  If at any point you can't even get a one-page synopsis to work, stop.  Binge on good stories.

If you can't think about what to write about, write about what you think is stopping you from writing. The first 10 minutes of this exercise will likely be really tough, but the second half should become pretty organic.   A lot of writers find this technique really useful. Tim Schafer of Monkey Island fame uses this technique all the time."

Screenwriting,3a907s,Slickrickkk,-1,Thu Jun 18 15:42:11 2015 UTC,"The correct answer is, you find a way to write it without camera direction. Describe everything around him, forcing the camera to look the direction you want it to look. Make the words you use suggest the kind of moment we're supposed to see. If its slo-mo, long eloquent sentences. Action, quick movements, use short terse language.  The fact of the matter is, what you write in terms of camera direction ultimately does not matter because your authority will be taken by the Director, DP, or anyone they answer to, or anyone below them with an unsolvable problem that alters the scene. Even if they land on the same shot, your input on the matter is inconsequential to the point of being a good guess on your part that this was the best way to shoot the scene. It's simply not your job and it means you're focusing on the wrong audience for your work.  You are building blue prints for a project. The only people you need to concern yourself with are either filmmakers or gatekeepers to investors. It is not your job to act, or shoot, or frame. It is your job to get people passionate about an idea that has backfired on thousands of people who have bet large sums of money on film. It is your job to create something that makes people want to work for you because they either see they have something to gain, or they are howling in ecstasy at the vision you just gave them. You can discuss shot ideas in preproduction because any company worth a damn is going to have their people talk to you at some point, and if they don't, they'll likely botch the piece and you'll want as much distance from it anyways.   But if nothing else, this is basic problem solving. And if you can't figure this out, you are straight up fucked, all the way around. I'm not just talking script. I'm talking life. You have to be able to recognize limitations and find ways around them. Writing is primarily problem solving. Balancing story elements with medium constraints and diction all while guiding a reader's experience and hopefully managing something as nuanced as theme, while making it all marketable. Every time you put words in some organized fashion in order to elicit a desired result, you are problem solving. You are weighing all the different factors in order to solve the immediate problem of not having your desired result right this instant. And getting a script right, is only the first of an astronomical number of problems you will face on the road to getting a finished film. You want me to tell you the proper phrasing for this. I'm telling you. There is none. Because its unacceptable for you to rely on that candy ass crutch. You'll sink to the bottom of the lake before you ever get to the bikes."

If the occasional camera direction is the most succinct way to do that, go for it. Just use it sparingly, because if you use it too much it will do the opposite of your intention and take the reader out of your movie.  It doesn't matter one iota if your direction is ignored in production. This isn't a shooting script, anyhow. It's a spec.  All that said...does this camera direction really matter? Is it integral to understanding the action, or is it just a stylistic flourish (ala Bay)? If so, then you really should consider cutting it. Again, save it for when it really matters."

You can straight out write ""The camera turns 360 degrees around Mike"" or as you write ""The camera circles Mike"" 2. But if you want to leave more to the imagination of the director/reader, but still suggest this angle, you could write something along the lines of: The world seems to spin around Mike as he stands still.   Personally, I'd go for something like number two so you can exercise your creativity a bit more. And really, at the end of the day, the director might decide a dolly-in could be better."

That's why it's called The Empire Strikes Back... after the events of the first film, you didn't expect an organization known as The Empire to just go away quietly, did you? From moment one, there's disaster during the entire Hoth sequence. From there, Luke goes to Dagobah to train as a Jedi, only to become disheartened and leave to help his friends before he learns what he needs to. The others go to Cloud City only to be betrayed. Then it's all downhill, culminating in Luke Skywalker, believing he's fighting to avenge his father, being told that his father is Darth Vader, maybe the most evil man in the galaxy, which crushes him. The whole movie ends with the remaining heroes sitting around, wondering how they're ever going to get themselves out of the mess they're left in.

Screenwriting,3a8ev7,From_that_which_was,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:52:54 2015 UTC,"The night is darkest before the dawn, mayhaps.  I think that extrapolating a theme solely from Empire Strikes Back is tricky because it's a sequel that was made with the knowledge that it was the middle piece of a trilogy. Everything that happens in ESB is the aftermath of ANH, and it's also a long, winding set-up for RotJ. So really I would say that if you want to look at Star Wars themes, you should either look at A New Hope on its own or the trilogy as a whole.  But I always felt like one of the themes was that you can't defeat an enemy you don't understand. ESB (to me) is largely based on twists involving who exactly our heroes are fighting. Darth Vader is Luke's father; Lando betrayed Han; the Empire is actually ruled by a mysterious Emperor as opposed to Vader (not shocking, given that it is an Empire, after all, but you get my point). The Rebels face a series of crushing defeats in ESB because they don't yet truly know who the Empire is. Another way of looking at it is that ESB shows the pitfalls of a lack of foresight. Luke sees and rejects the reality that the Dark Side of the Force lives within him; Han's presumptive (if skeptical) trust of Lando is based on an old friendship, ignoring the changing political landscape; and Luke's abandonment of his Jedi training to save his friends demonstrates that he is still too focused on looking backward instead of forward. All in all, our heroes underestimate and misjudge the Empire, and in doing so they suffer great losses."

We say New Hope is about faith, and how that faith relates to technology and the threat of evil.  Return of the Jedi we say is about redemption, and if you put Empire in the middle I think it's fair to say that ""hopelessness"" isn't the theme so much as sacrifice and maintaining hope in the face of a threat to your faith.  If we really want to go out on a limb, we might even look to the titles of these movies.  ""A New Hope"" - hope, faith, belief.  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" - vengeance of a vanquished foe; the inexorable threat of evil (and how those of faith respond to that threat).  ""Return of the Jedi"" - return; redemption; the courage and persistence of 'good' despite the omnipresence of evil.

Screenwriting,3a5eur,Lawant,7,Wed Jun 17 10:55:39 2015 UTC,"Here's my process:   After I finish my first pass, I let it sit for about two weeks. I resist the urge to foist it on anyone at this point. I think this time to ""cure"" is very important. Right after I type ""fade to black"" I'm too close to the script to look at it objectively. I go back to this first draft and -- assuming I don't find any major problems -- I give it a ""courtesy"" polish (typos, grammar, etc.) before sending to my trusted few for feedback. These are likeminded people who ""get"" my writing but aren't afraid to tell me when something isn't working for them. Typically, this is a small group of 3-4 writers. I compile their feedback, paying special attention to two things: A) Criticism shared by multiple readers, B) Criticism from those that most liked the script/concept. I sit on this feedback for about a week. Taste it, chew it up, let it ferment in the gut. I consolidate the round 1 feedback with my own notes into a checklist. Sometimes I create a revised outline if the structure is going to drastically change. Then I rinse and repeat with the second draft. The biggest difference with round 2 is that I cast a wider net in terms of audience. I get it into the hands of people with different tastes than mine, but that I still trust. At this stage I don't limit it to just writers, either. (Deciding which notes to integrate is much more difficult at this stage. I have to take much more responsibility for weeding the wheat from the chaff. It's easy to doubt the script's direction because opinions will vary wildly.)"

Screenwriting,3a5eur,Golobulus,3,Wed Jun 17 21:51:27 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, you'll need to figure out what works for you.  Here's how I rewrite.   Finish first draft.  Wait a while.  Everyone will tell you to wait as long as you can, I'm an impatient man so I most likely start on the 2nd draft sooner than most. Print it out.  Read it from front to back in one shot, noting what works and what doesn't work as far as the general story is concerned.  I'll quickly jot down my thoughts of things that need to change on a post it, and slap it on the scene.  I can tell you, my two biggest offenses are I tend to write too economically the first time around, and I'm way too polite to my characters.  So I'll write, ""Flesh out"" and ""conflict"" more times than not.   I'll rewrite the outline for what is actually happening in the script, and include what I want to really be happening.  Here is where I'll list my notes.   I get cracking on tackling each of the scenes, making sure to be a mean bitch to the characters this time, stuffing as much conflict as i can per scene.   After I've made it through all of my noted changes, I'll repeat 1-4 until the story feels good.  Could be 1...2...3 drafts.  Whatever it takes.   As you've been going along, you'll probably notice that you're figuring out what the real story is, the theme, the characters, etc to a much deeper level than on the first crack.  The rewritten scenes give me ample fodder to start weaving in callbacks and all of that fun sort of stuff, and that turns into a self-perpetuating cycle.  I tend to read a lot of scripts when I'm rewriting, because I notice all the cool shit other people have done and try and figure out how that applies to my story. When I'm feeling good about the story, I'll re-address my action lines, because they probably suck and can be beat down.  I'll then work on my dialogue specifically.  I find though, that during steps 4-6, my dialogue gets way better.  Why?  Because for me at least the biggest reason my dialogue sucks is because the scene itself sucks.  Either there isn't enough conflict, I don't have a good enough grasp on one of the characters, or the action and dialogue isn't fully integrated into the scene. Now's a good time to print the thing out again, and repeat step 2.  You're probably going to need to do another draft.    You will know when you're comfortable and ready to send to someone for a read thru and to get feedback.  Just remember that asking someone to spend 1-2 hours reading your screenplay and another 1-2 hours putting together their thoughts for you is asking a lot, so try and get it to a place where you've put some real work into it beyond the first draft.  Unless you're hiring a paid reader (which is also a good option to explore), it's going to be real hard to get them to check the whole thing out again objectively if it was god awful the first time around.     One final note on all of this, is I can't stress enough HOW MUCH BETTER YOUR SHIT IS after you rewrite.  You didn't use up all your good ideas the first time, I promise.  Don't copy and paste a whole scene, just take the 1-2 pieces that are truly good from the first pass and start over from scratch.  I promise, promise, promise it will be 500X better than the time before, and you're going to be like, ""Holy shit, I actually wrote that?"".

Screenwriting,3a5eur,29Neibolt,2,Wed Jun 17 18:21:07 2015 UTC,"Diagnose, plan, then treat.   Whatever your diagnosis process is (reading it out loud, reading it fast, reading it with a pen in your hand, feedback from friends, perhaps all of the above) the first thing you need to do is figure out what you're not doing that you want to be doing.   The second step is to figure out how to fix that.   The third step is to apply those fixes.   A lot of less-experienced writers just dive in and start tinkering. Late in the process, that makes sense, but if you're doing it early, you want to make sure you're not shuffling deck chairs around on the titanic."
Screenwriting,3a5eur,HotspurJr,2,Wed Jun 17 15:57:59 2015 UTC,"It depends on who I'm doing the rewrite for.  I've left the script to rest for some time, and now I'm reading it through and want to improve it I read it through, try to move scenes around or omit things that aren't working. I'm polishing the dialogue.  I've written a spec script that has been out there, and an agent and/or production companies are interested in buying it but they have ""a few suggestions"" I have meetings with them to see who of them actually has the same vision as I, so I don't start fixing things to make the script into something I don't want it to be.  I've been commissioned to write a script, and I've delivered the first version (this is the most common case for a screenwriter) Well, it's a job. I might not agree, and I'll clearly tell the producer and/or director why I don't agree. But in the end, they're paying me to deliver a script they want to make into a movie. Actors might already be attached. It might (is probably) based on a book or on characters from a tv series, or it's a sequel. If you're new in the business, remember to separate things. On one hand you want to write the best screenplay possible, and be praised for it. On the other hand, you are hired to do a job and often it's not about writing the best screenplay. It's about writing the best possible screenplay given the instructions from others that are involved in the project. It's always sad to see critics mention how bad the script was, when they have no idea about the process. If you're a screenwriter that knows the craft, and knows how to work with other people in bigger projects, you will keep getting work. From my own experience, I've seen tons of writers that wrote one great script that was produced and awarded yet can't get any work."
Screenwriting,3a5eur,MrOaiki,2,Wed Jun 17 16:09:09 2015 UTC,"Just got a lot of notes back on a script so this is perfect timing.  It really depends on the nature of the notes; if it's a large note, then I go back to outline and try to see where the problem is.   The notes I got today alter the structure significantly while still maintaining the major plot points. I wrote each note down, and have a rough idea in my head of how I'm going to solve it. As I go through the script now I am re-arranging things, and really cutting down on the first act while expanding the second. A lot of this is largely instinct and being able to budget pages (knowing exactly how many pages I should have for Act I with the rewrite, and how many for Act II). Once the new script if Frankensteined together, I'm going to do a few smoothing passes before getting to the detail work."
Screenwriting,3a5eur,ogresaregoodpeople,2,Wed Jun 17 21:45:48 2015 UTC,"Table reads are great. First, be upfront with everyone there, make sure that they know to take note of anything that felt off about the story for them (most importantly for the character that they're reading for, since those people are more likely to defend the POV that they have spent the last 2 hours portraying, giving you possible opportunities to better develop your characters) and let you know. Once you finish hearing them, fix the criticisms that you can't defend. Finally, drink whiskey and cry. Repeat.  *Edit: You should obviously be grateful to the people who are giving up their time to read through your work, make it a night, by them drinks. Let them know you appreciate them beyond just mouths that get to regurgitate your words."
Screenwriting,3a5eur,BuffRogers,2,Thu Jun 18 03:53:48 2015 UTC,"One suggestion is to print out your script, then for each scene in turn type out very briefly (preferably in one sentence) what happens to advance the story in that scene.

Screenwriting,3a6cmu,zombdi,3,Wed Jun 17 16:03:59 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming the ""complete crap"" you're referring to is a first draft?  Or at the very least an early draft?  There's a phrase you'll hear a lot and that is ""Writing is rewriting"".  Nothing produced that you see or read is a ""true"" first draft.  Often times the first draft is called the ""speed pass"" or the ""vomit draft"" meaning you get it on the page as fast and as ugly as possible.  Because that's not where the real work comes in.  The real work is in the rewrite.    If you drop it and write something new, the chances are THAT will also be crap.  Not because you're a bad writer per se, but because the nature of writing is in the fixing not the initial writing.  I read somewhere that Michael Arndt wrote Little Miss Sunshine in two weeks, then he spent A YEAR rewriting it.  I remember reading somewhere else that Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright did 15 or 20 drafts of Shaun of the Dead.  (These are both old articles and I wasn't able to find the links offhand.  Also, my memory may of the facts may not be the most reliable.)  But the point is, the real heavy lifting of writing, for me, is done after that first draft.  I feel like not enough emphasis is put on rewriting, which is really what is going to make or break your script.  The fact that you can recognize it as crap, is actually great.  Because I've read scripts that are crap that the writer's believe to be genius.  Recognizing crap in your own work is essential, I believe.  So, I think you're on the right track.  Really take the time to lean into the rewrites and I think you'll surprise yourself.  Edit:  Spelling"

This seems like a good place to come from: something about it fascinates you enough that you both have a history and are still very actively writing, just for your own reasons... for people like me that door is already closed, and it raises the obvious question: if I've never really written before now, why?  I used to work in pro sport coaching and there were two very different workers there...    those who had been doing it as a hobby for years and eventually found the industry,  and those who studied the industry in university and went straight into teaching.   Both had their own strengths/weaknesses, but the people who came to it from it already being their life lasted a lot longer and had a grasp on the soul of it a lot earlier...  Best wishes for LA!"

Like almost every skill-based activity, there are people with natural talent for it, and people who can do it mechanically. Like, playing the piano. You can learn to be a very good piano player even if it's not your passion, provided you put in the effort to practice, etc. But some people just have a 'spark', a natural flair, and the difference is, in this case, audible.   I don't think I fall into the 'spark' category. What I do have is a drive to write. Whether or not I'm good enough to make the final cut remains to be seen, but my current path is to achieve every small step I can, and that's been doing well for me.   So for someone who's never really written before, well, why did you start now? Are you just finally answering the call that's been there the whole time, one you've been ignoring? Or are you doing it for fun, because it's something you find enjoyment in (versus fulfillment)? Either answer is completely acceptable, but there's the underlying difference, right there. Some people come into screenwriting because they have decent grammar, a good sense of humor, and because they can write mechanically. Then there are the Cameron Crowes, who seem to write out of instinct.  If writing makes you happy and you enjoy it, pursue it, even if it's just in a hobby capacity. And thank you!

So i see it as a ""Inheritance hobby"" - i have a regular industry day job and write at night - and when I get paid to write - it's like i just inherited a certain sum of money - which is great.

How about this:  Keep listening to Scriptnotes and reading scripts (or start if you don't), but if by books you mean screenwriting theory books, put them away.

In a little over 3 1/2 months, you'd have a feature-length script. It might be god awful, but it'd still be a script.   And you would have learned a lot in doing it. More than just reading the books alone. Maybe go back to them after.  There's also the risk it might kill the dream forever, but you at least will have given it a go."

I live in Nashville, where you can't swing a dead cat without hitting an insanely talented musician or songwriter. A good portion of them are also incredibly hard-working and driven. A decent chunk of those are also attractive and well-spoken. Some are even business savvy. Yet, almost all of even that subset will not realize their dream. Period.   Anyone who tries to be a star* has to be a little delusional. The most likely outcome (by a WIDE margin) is that you won't make it. Accepting that you probably won't make it is not being defeatist. It's armoring yourself for the long battle. Accept it and then do every damn thing you can to prove yourself wrong. Have a plan B job that you don't hate. Pursue plan B first (or at least simultaneously.) You can have a comfortable lifestyle while you don't sell any scripts, or you can wait tables while you don't sell any scripts.

Screenwriting,3a4vy3,RainAmongstSpace,3,Wed Jun 17 23:08:21 2015 UTC,"The thing I love about the film business is how entrepreneurial of a venture it is. In a lot of ways, Hollywood is a lot like Silicon Valley. Every year there's 1000s of startup companies but only a handful ever become huge or moderate success. Creating a first film is like a startup company.  Being a screenwriter sucks because you're stuck at the first stages of a very long, arduous film production cycle and everyone thinks they can write a compelling script worthy of a million(s) dollar budget. There's really two paths I see to take in playing the game of Hollywood: (1) write your scripts and send them off to be read by the gatekeepers. The key point of this strategy is that you need to network, network, network. Recently a friend of mine wrote a screenplay and through some connections was able to find a creative head for a new production company to take a look at his screenplay; they weren't really interested in his screenplay but they were interested in hiring him as a writer-for-hire in the future. That's a pretty good success story, let's hope it pans out for him, but there's no real guarantees as to what he'll be working on and if it'll be of any worth. So if you want to just be a lone writer looking to sell a screenplay or find work, this is your only option and frankly, it kind of sucks, because you're depending on the kindness of other strangers (agents, producers etc) finding/giving you jobs and they're jobs you're probably not that interested in doing anyways. How you go about networking, finding an agent is up to you. If there was one way of doing it, we'd all have agents.  That brings us to strategy number two. (2) Write your screenplay and make it yourself. There are limitations here, for sure, but this I feel is the best way to play the game as it allows you the best possible freedom in how you define the career you have. The limitations are that you don't have a giant corporation funneling money into your project nor do you have the technological expertise of CGI houses at your disposal. You're limited to a very small, baseline budget. However, the limits here are simply your imagination and if you have any salt as a writer, you can make something from nothing. But you can't just write it, you're now the Producer of the script so you need to find people to help you make it. Now, the odds here are somewhere around 1/1000(s), you competing against all the other self-produced films which are becoming more abundant as the years go on. Your goal, however, is not to compete with these other films, your goal is to sell your movie. It's already produced, all it needs is a distributor and a market now. If it's made at a professional level, your chances of selling it are probably greater than trying to sell a screenplay because thinking from a business perspective it makes more sense to buy a finish project than something you need to champion through the headache of production. Film Festivals are places where you can sell your film; it's not about winning the festival, its about selling your film. So, really, with this option the game is about how well can you write and produce a low-budget that's marketable, that's attractive to distributors, that shows your cache for making global entertainment and not just some onanistic art piece that nobody wants to bring their dates or families too (which is the bulk of most movies at this level, as far as I'm concerned). A lot of screenwriters don't really understand the business side of filmmaking and they write blindly and wonder why they're not Paul Schrader yet. The conflict here is that they want to be ""authentic"", ""truthful"", ""personal"" or ""realistic"" in their writing and don't understand why a large majority of people go to the movies. The tragedy is, there's no reason why you can't make a ""personal"", ""truthful"" film in a way that holds mass appeal. Film is an industrial artform, it operates on money, deadlines and dividends; take that seriously.   It's kinda just looking at a screen. Lonely. (meanwhile your friends are out teaching rockclimbing to astronauts, helping rebuild cities, volunteering for orangutan rehabilitation, crewing for fighter planes, or just Walking the Earth like Caine in Kung Fu)   I've recently struggled with this but this is the way I see it (and I'm going to get philosophical here), your life is passing through you moment to moment. If the Fear of Missing Out is truly something you are terrified of and it distracts you from your writing, then chances are you're not cut out for the life of a writer. A writer is someone who values thought-play, the process of putting ideas together, making new combinations, playing with story logic, character perspectives, directing/misdirecting an audience, creating sensory experience through words and images etc ad infinitum. To a writer, this process is just as exhilarating as teaching rockclimbing or whatever comes to mind (and the two don't have to be mutually exclusive, either). Writers LOVE this process. They're Gods in labcoats experiment in the fertile dirt of abstraction within their own imagination. Sure, writers can get frustrated and not be on speaking terms with a project, but god help them that they can't stop trying to figure it out and that it doesn't consume their soul over. The process is crack cocaine. If the blank page doesn't give you a high, you're not a writer-writer."

Screenwriting is my passion.    If you have talent and unrelenting determination you can make it happen. Have you ever heard of an eighty year old man who's been in Hollywood for sixty years trying to break through as a writer? No, you don't because one of the following has happened:    • He had no talent and finally realized it. • He wasn't serious about it and let other things get in the way (i.e. family, friends). • He realized his passion lied elsewhere, or he pursued money elsewhere for more stability. • Or, least likely, he was talented, unrelenting, and focused enough to break through and become a screenwriter."

Quit, was my advice; if you can stop, maybe you should.

Having written a joke or a sketch that made people laugh gives me the validation I can ride on for days. It gives me energy, I jump out of bed in the morning where with my regular job (which is not at all bad either) I am always sorta late.  I can get so much energy and emotion out of 'discovering' a movie or tv-series I've previously not watched or didn't know. That's just what happens.  Is the sense of accomplishment or the validation filling some kind of nasty void in my personality? Probably, but  I can be an adult about it. What I can't (or won't) do is ignore it.   It took me quite some time to realize that it isn't a choice-- I thought it was. And technically, obviously, it is, but if I would choose to abandon all that is writing and creating, I would lead a life maybe half as full as I consider decent. If I get paid or not, if I have a career or not is not that important anymore.

I have a few brave ideas for stuff I'd like to write. Without touching pen to paper, it is already better than this, or this.  Thelatter of these two atrocities had a budget pf 49 million dollars; I can't find a number for the first - but I guess they spend more than a nickel on it. Had I spend a nickle on it, I'd be demanding my money back.  So ... I have no idea if screenwriting is for me. But I'll try. I am probably going to be worse tan some, but then, I am going to be better than a lot of others that have managed to get their stuff turned into films."

Brave ideas are nothing without ""touching pen to paper."" Idea to first draft is an giant step, first draft to a production ready draft is a bigger step, and final draft to actual production and release is larger still. It's simply hilarious to compare a shot and released movie to a ""brave idea.""   Edit:    ... I am going to be better than a lot of others that have managed to get their stuff turned into films.    How can you even say that? You haven't written a single script. It's absurd to think you are so much more talented than the 1500 plus working screenwriters and the thousands of aspirers without having undergone the principle work."

I'm pretty confident that I have an interesting idea, but I know that it would:   need a huge budget the opening act is a completely different tone to the second half my key scenes are currently free floating and merging together at tectonic pace it's probably too high concept (or plain rubbish) to warrant attention.   Of course, I still think it will get noticed and I don't know that I'd have half the drive if I didn't have faith that I could get something good from it at the end.   But having doubts keeps me analysing what I've written, smacking it with a sledgehammer and making sure it doesn't crack, rethinking motivation and dialogue and characterisation, questioning if I need everyone and if they are people or devices or clones.  I think doubt is the only thing that ensures a quality product, and to 'know' that your thing is going to be better than everything else before you've written a word leaves you in a position where you ultimately don't put the care in to ensure it is.  William Goldman says the only things he's written and is proud of are The Princess Bride and Butch Cassidy. Abundance of 'CUT TO:' excepted, the Butch Cassidy script is incredible and it's clearly only set the man's bar higher. Moral: don't sit on your laurels."

My point was that however many writers are being paid, and how ever many truly great scripts may exist out there and be made, the business apparently has room for 13 and chappie.  I - or anyone else - who wants to be a writer who gets stuff produced doesn't have to come up with the next Shawsank Redemption, Chinatown or the Usual Suspects.

My point is that having written a script you can hold it up and say 'this is an investment of time and mind over x pages'. It may be devoid of any worth, but unless you force yourself to do it then you have nothing to refine and no proof that you can put the effort in.

I loved the combination of science geeks and a slacker the original films had because it was a really great contrast of characters and that dynamic is part of what made the characters great.   Your complaint boggles my mind, because the original film started with the characters being kicked out of academia.   And you're comparing two characters who are only described as ""unheralded authors"" - with the fully written and acted portrayals of characters from the original film. How do you know that Wiig won't be a ""science geek"" while McCarthy is a ""slacker"" or vice versa, much less something equally or more interesting.  I mean, if you stuck with the original, and applied this level of detail, you'd just describe them as ""paranormal researchers."" And that's it. Make an apples-to-apples comparison.   I mean, look, maybe the film will suck, who knows?  And I'm not crazy about the remake/reboot fever taking over Hollywood, either.   But you are complaining here about a lack of detail and specificity in a synopsis and assuming that lack of detail says something about the level of detail and specificity in the script and film.  And that's just moronic. It's a synopsis - not even Feig's synopsis but rather some text that was handed by a PR flack to a newspaper writer and lightly reworded to make it their own."

And if they are acknowledging the first two, then it's even dumber; you mean to tell me that after two huge incidents in which the world was almost destroyed, and one involved a giant marshmallow man and the Statue of Liberty walking around in NYC that people still don't believe that ghosts exist?

Tons of great websites, podcasts, sites on which to read scripts, etc. Write a few more scripts, get feedback on those, try your hand at rewriting based on feedback. Just submitting to something like Amazon right out of the chute seems reckless, IMO.   Just an FYI -- my curiosity being what it is, I opened the pdf and glanced through maybe 4 pages. Formatting is a mess, the UPPER/lower case menagerie made me crazy, pages are riddled with annoying camera direction and with too many ( ) parantheticals (not to mention being in the wrong place), etc. LOTS of things screaming ""novice!!""

What you'll learn is the better you get at writing dialogue, the less you'll need to use them. In other words, well-crafted dialogue will virtually speak for itself. As you read professional scripts, you'll see what I mean --- they're rare, they're brilliant, and they may hint at delivery or some action going on at the time of delivery. When there are too many, it's just annoying for any reader, much less for actors who can't understand why you're telling them their job.  As for standard form --- if you MUST use a parathetical, it should be placed beneath the character name and then the dialogue starts not on the same line but on the next line down. Like so -- only these comment boxes aren't spaced like in a script, sorry:  CHARACTER  (eye on the prize)  You better believe it, buster!  Upper case, lower case thing. The first time you introduce a character, put the name in ALL CAPS. Thereafter, lower case is fine. Action, etc. is lower case. Character names for dialogue, upper case. You'll see this plainly when  you read scripts.   Camera direction --- ya don't need it. A case can be made for feeling differently if you're also directing, but it's not necessary. Someone else is going to come along -- someone much more qualified, of course -- and make decisions about how to best shoot the scenes you script on the page. If something is of dire importance to you, you can call it out, but you still don't need to mention camera angles or whatever.   As for software..... there are a bunch. I'm not necessarily advocating that you rush right out and buy it. For a while, you can get by doing what you're doing --- maybe just refer to some sort of guide for formatting scripts in Word, or whatever. I'm sure that sort of thing is out there. Software is great, and takes a lot of guesswork out of the formatting part, but it can't help you be a good storyteller -- know what I mean? You can scribble a story on paper towels for all I care ---- just work on your storytelling craft first, worry about format later.   Classes are fine, but again, this constitutes spending money when perhaps it doesn't need to be spent. Delve into free resources first. One of the best websites I've found and still go to every single day is GO INTO THE STORY. There are a TON of superb series on there, scroll along the left side and you'll find you can lose yourself for days. That website also has a bunch of links to scripts so you can read. My recommendation is you choose scripts that fit into whatever sort of genre you're most passionate about and start there. But don't limit to that. Read whatever you can get your hands on --- you'll pick up a LOT from reading great scripts.   It's not uncommon to be anxious. Over-anxious, even. No worries!!! I shudder thinking about some of the stuff I shared out there years ago when it was all shit. And maybe I still write shit, I don't know. I'd like to think I've made strides, but that's yet to be seen. Be patient with yourself. Write a LOT!! Throw the first four, five, six scripts in the bottom drawer and forget about 'em. Well, get some folks to read and give you feedback, maybe try your hand at rewriting, but keep working toward that ONE BIG IDEA that will invariably come down the pipe to you if you keep your wits about you.   Good Luck! And most importantly, have fun! In the infamous words of Crash Davis in BULL DURHAM: ""This is supposed to be fun, dammit!"""

There's not a lot to 'get' - there is something to it, but its really not an undertone.    I kinda like it. I like how disturbing it is, without showing you hardly anything (if I remember rightly).

Screenwriting,3a4znp,RollingPicturesMedia,3,Wed Jun 17 07:56:05 2015 UTC,"I like your dialogue and the actual story, but your writing style needs a little work. Try breaking up the large chunks of action. The way you have it now makes it heavy and tiring to read.  Check out some scripts by Dan Gilroy and you'll see what I mean... Punchy ;)"
Screenwriting,3a4znp,Ragesome,2,Wed Jun 17 13:00:18 2015 UTC,"I agree. Unless the action is really brief I'll skip to the next line of dialogue and just try to work out what I missed.   General notes -   Couple of spelling errors.  Page 2. Exiting -> Exciting.  Page 3. Listen to be very carefully.  Both agents use ""trust me"". You could either change the line for one of them or turn it into a running joke.   A couple of times the punctuation seems to work against how you want it to be read. Things like ""He turns on his phone, and presses some buttons. Soon, Sullivan's face once again appears."" The commas really aren't needed. --> He turns on his phone and presses some buttons. Sullivan's face appears.   Overall, really good. Each character felt interesting, real, and full of potential. Dialogue and tone are real strengths. Never boring (except when the action description went on longer than it should). You stayed ahead of your audience the whole way which made it interesting to read. It was missing some sort of bigger pay off at the end. But you could expand on the whole piece to reach that if needed.   Suggestions -  Maybe play around a bit with Charlie asking Reed about what it's like to be an agent, and have him showing some naive excitement (similar to his dialogue with Glen) that he's involved in an actual car chase.   From that, an alternative suggestion for a final line -   CHARLIE  Director?  SULLIVAN   What?   CHARLIE  I'm going to need clean up crew at 4th and Main.   That gives it some payoff as we can see that Charlie already sees himself as an agent rather than asking for a promotion.   Anyway, whatever you choose to do with this I think you're off to a great start."

Screenwriting,3a4znp,joe12south,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:45:51 2015 UTC,"Overall, good job. Here's some critique in the spirt of making it even better:   As others have stated, you need to break-up those dense blocks of description. Think of each paragraph as a shot. Each time the shot changes in your mind's eye, start a new paragraph. Not only will this be easier to read, but it will encourage the reader to ""see"" the action the way you see it.   Now I'll forego more  notes on the nuts and bolts, and concentrate on the content:   The movie lacks a clear tone. It hints at being comedic, but then quickly becomes nothing but straight action. It could be good either way, but you need to pick a tone and commit to it. The dialog is too clunky...it took me out of the story. Characters are speaking in a long-hand that sounds like exposition, not how real people in this world would speak to each other. (They know each other, they know their jobs.) Some of the talk about tradecraft feels off, it just doesn't ring true. (Doesn't have to be truly accurate, just needs to sound believable.) I strongly encourage you to get some friends together and do a table read. I want Charlie to have some real personality beyond ""generic schlub."" Is he a screw-up? An overachiever? The beneficiary of nepotism? Who is Charlie before he transforms into Agent Charlie? Your first scene needs to really paint a picture of this guy. The two antagonists are similarly generic. They both need to have something distinctive about them and their motivation, especially if you decide to make this a comedy."

Moving locations costs time/money, so less locations, the better. Shooting inside leaves less room for outside disturbances that can delay production. Also cheaper to shoot day than night.   That's why contained thrillers are so loved by buyers, you can make them cheap. Something like Saw - the majority is two guys in a bathroom. Or The Disappearance of Alice Creed. Two kidnappers and their victim. Or Buried - a guy in a box.   If you write an awesome contained thriller, for example, it shows that you can write good characters and interesting plots, while keeping the budget low. Skills that people like in writers.    And there are way more films made in the world on budgets of $500k than $50 million. So it can mean a much better chance of breaking in."

Screenwriting,3a1n9v,slushpileplayer,10,Tue Jun 16 16:05:17 2015 UTC,you need more equipment.  More lights. Generators and such.  Would be my guess.  *which would translate to you needing more time to set up for shots
Screenwriting,3a1n9v,COL2015,3,Tue Jun 16 16:17:52 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what it is.  On indie films, you're often shooting 6 day weeks as it is (saves you money on equipment rentals in the long run), so a night shoot can also potentially throw a wrench in the schedule, especially if most of the shoot doesn't take place at night.  You end up running into potential issues with turnaround, which means more costs as well.  Though with improving camera technology (better low light results) and creative problem solving (making a little money go a long way) you can get some great results.  NIGHTCRAWLER used minimal movie lighting, opting to use what they naturally had at their locations for the most part and WILD is said to have had only a minimal Grip & Electric team where absolutely needed, which would mean most of the time there would be no lighting, no complex silks/flags, no dolly, etc., which lets them move fast since they only had to worry about camera getting set up as far as equipment goes.  Obviously that won't work for every movie, but that's a great way to save.  If you have no idea how much your script would cost, browse IMDB and BoxOfficeMojo.com to see what similar movies had for their production budget, stars attached (or not), and how much they made back.  That'll give you a sense of what you're looking at.  Edit: To reflect correction that WILD did in fact have some G&E, just not for much of the shoot."

If a scene relies on perfect conditions, or requires a high number of re-takes, it could get expensive (Like the scene in ""The bridge on the river kwai"", where they had to build an actual bridge and blow it up while there was a train on it, risking the whole movie on a single take).  The fewer locations you include, the lower the cost will be, but don´t write a script with only one location (unless you´re sure it´s gold, this has been done to death by people attempting to write low-budget films)."

Even though you intend for all the rooms to be in one building, depending on what kind of rooms you need the scenes may be shot in different locations. If it's something like a house, you'll probably only need one location. If it's some kind of government agency or something more complex, then it might require multiple locations.  This is a little more subjective, but 20 characters is getting close to a lot in my perspective. Those are all actors that will have to be paid. If you could make the same movie with half that many characters, it would be a lot cheaper.   People walking on the street, don't worry too much about unless they impact the story at all. About the TV stuff, if you see it, someone made it. You could use stock footage of riots or something on the news, but if it's an original piece of footage that relates to the story, someone is going to have to shoot it."

I think even if I didn't care about cost, I'd like this to be leaner and simpler, anyway.     But I think 500k awfully is optimistic for this. Under 5m seems reasonable. Just what are the ""low budget"" limits, anyway?"
Screenwriting,3a1n9v,COL2015,5,Tue Jun 16 22:13:14 2015 UTC,"For reference...   SAG Ultra Low Budget - $200,000 or less.  The day rate for a SAG actor at this level is $125.  There is no weekly rate.  You're allowed to use a mix of SAG and non-union. SAG Modified Low Budget - $200,000 - $625,000.  The day rate for a SAG actor at this level is $335.  The weekly rate is $1,166.  You're not permitted to use non-union actors for speaking roles unless you TAFT-Hartley them.  Extras may be SAG or non-union. SAG Low Budget - $625,000 - $2,500,000.  The day rate for a SAG actor at this level is $630.  The weekly rate is $2,190.  You're not permitted to use non-union actors for speaking roles or background unless you TAFT-Hartley them.   On top of this, you also have to account for SAG Pension & Health (17.3%) and depending on which state you're shooting in, employer tax burden (in California, we can round it to 30% for the sake of discussion).  That means if you have an actor making scale ($125) on an ULB shoot, your total cost for their 8 hours of work would be: $125 + $59.13 = $184.13  That doesn't include any payroll costs you'd incur if you don't handle it yourself.  I'd strongly encourage hiring a payroll service so prevent any errors and penalties from SAG.  Then add on that most films aren't working the leads just 8 hours so you have to pay time and a half, then double time if they do a 12 hour day.  And this is just one actor, working at scale, not including per diem or housing if you're shooting out of town, or wardrobe fees, etc..  Now imagine you have a C-List celeb wanting $30,000 to do a week of work (real number)...It adds up very fast and suddenly you see how these things end up costing so much."

Screenwriting,3a1n9v,COL2015,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:29:27 2015 UTC,"All the unions have this stuff laid out pretty clearly (just in long contracts you have to read to understand), the exception to that is that most of them don't bother stipulating rates for shoots under $1,500,000.  I see a lot of ""as negotiated but must be equal to or greater than minimum wage"".    Night Premiums for the indie stuff I've mostly worked on (less than $1,000,000) does not deal with night premiums, so you catch a little break there, but you still have to be concerned about getting your crew at least 10 hours of turnaround.  So if you're shooting overnight on Thursday and something goes wrong, meaning you don't get out of there till 8am, you don't want to call your crew until 6pm at the earliest, 8pm ideally, which means you might lose out on some set-up/rigging time depending on what you're doing.  And that could mean you finish late that day too...once things start falling behind, it can get tricky trying to right the ship.  One you get into the $1,500,000 and above, there are often premiums to be paid for certain union positions for work outside of certain hours.  I'm not sure how much it might differ between each union as you'd have to look at each of the individual contracts or ask a production accountant and they'd know it off the top of their head.  You also have to pay fringes, meal penalties (as needed), etc.  It's all negotiated and spelled out in the current agreements.  Example on page 6: https://www.usa829.org/Portals/0/Documents/Contracts/TV-Film-Commercials/Independent-MoPic-Contract_2013-2014_B.pdf  Night shoots are also more expensive because they often just mean more lights, a generator, and more crew to make use of those things."

Screenwriting,3a1n9v,DickHero,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:31:15 2015 UTC,"How many are a lot of characters?   I ask that question all the friggin' time and came up with this:  Who is the main character? What does the main character need? Who tries to stop the main character? Who tries to help the main character? Does the main character get their need? What does the main character learn?  That's 3 characters no matter what. If the main character is married, that's another character? Has kids? Grandkids? Co-workers. Oh, and who tries to stop the main character...is that antagonist married? Has kids. Hench-men and women who also have families and friends and co-workers. Who is the mentor...married, kids...co-workers. And so on.  This shit's expensive to cast.  One good exercise might be to write a scene between the Main Character, the antagonist, and the mentor and see what's there. It might be really cool if that's a scene in the movie.  tl;dr greater than 4-character scenario is unnecessary; 3 is necessary."
Screenwriting,3a1n9v,nunsinnikes,3,Thu Jun 18 00:13:21 2015 UTC,"I would also add that this depends on your goals.  If your goal is to sell/produce your spec script, writing cheaper increases those chances.  It your goal is to secure future jobs or find representation, it doesn't really matter.  Write something that showcases your abilities.  A great script can sometimes be more functional as a resume more than a product if you're unknown.    I think the most important advice is to write something you're passionate about that excites you and make it the best you can be.  It may not get made or sold until later in your career, but it'll be helpful in showcasing your voice and abilities."
Screenwriting,3a1n9v,wrytagain,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:10:30 2015 UTC,"I agree. I've written two scripts where I hardly (didn't) gave a thought to production costs. This one, is the last of the three scripts I've wanted to write, and I love the idea. It was originally two people at a table for 90 minutes.  But I wanted to change that and also get some experience keeping it simple. Low cost. Focused. Linear.   I usually write like Victorians embroidered."

I have a few polished scripts that I feel really represent me as a writer and am ready to take the ""next step.""  Aside from hoping to find industry parties and hang outs to rub elbows and make personal connections (though, tips on that would be appreciated)...what the hell do I do with these scripts? I spent so much time perfecting a ""portfolio.""  Now, how do I get someone to take a look?  Cold querying is all but dead, right?  Also, for scripts that are not high-concept enough to have a one-line pitch that sells the read, how do you form an elevator pitch/log line that captures the interest of jaded readers/representatives?"
Screenwriting,3a1n9v,120_pages,11,Tue Jun 16 17:27:17 2015 UTC,"rub elbows and make personal connections (...tips on that would be appreciated)   There are networking organizations in town, like Scriptwriters Network, and the independent film organizations.  Read books to increase your networking skills, like Never Eat Lunch Alone.  Join a tracking board like www.tracking-board.com.  It costs money, but you get direct access to development people who are aggressively looking for new talent.  Be polite, though.  It's like pitching a stranger at a pub.  Make friends first.  The important thing is to get into circulation.  Make friends, trade scripts.  If you can, get a job being a PA or a reader at a studio/production company.  Go through your L.A. contact list, and put the word out to anyone who might be connected to the business.  You never know which seed will sprout.   for scripts that are not high-concept...how do you form a log line?   Concentrate on the main character, what they're seeking, and what primal emotion that triggers.  If your script isn't high-concept, then it better be actor-bait.  It better have a great part for a big star.  That's what you pitch.  FWIW, not having a strong commercial concept is a handicap.  Many scripts are purchased just for the concept, and then are reworked by more experienced writers.  If your script doesn't have a unique concept, there's one less attractive feature to buy."

Whenever my project was ready I was prepared to try out blcklst.com; would this angle be better?  And since we're asking ""stupid"" questions, how successful would you estimate they are at finding and illuminating legitimate talent?  Let's just assume (hope; pray) my screenplay turns out fantastic and I were to get a Recommend from them.  Would tracking-board or anything similar actually be somewhat likely to find me a decent rep, get me in touch with development, etc?  I mean, I know it's always a crap shoot, but with talent is it a 50% crap shoot or a 5% crap shoot?  Sometimes it seems like the 0.1% chance of winning the Nicholl is a better investment than these sites..."
Screenwriting,3a1n9v,120_pages,5,Tue Jun 16 20:49:13 2015 UTC,"Tracking-board.com is a pretty good networking web site.  I don't know if they can get you a rep in a hurry, but you can make some very good connections if you're sociable.  Make note that when you join, they have a forum, and also a Google Group email list.  Join both -- there are quite a few development people who use the email list and don't bother with the forum.  Tracking-board.com also has a script contest called the Launch Pad that has a pretty strong record for attracting attention.  They just sent me an email touting the 63 writers who got repped from participating in that contest in the last 18 months.  Regarding the Black List website:  I recommending you ask folks who have spent money on that website whether it was worth it.    I hold an unpopular opinion that the black list website is of primary benefit to the owner of the website.  According to their own stats, nearly everyone (99%) achieves no career advancement at all, despite paying ongoing fees.  I personally dislike any and all pay-for-play schemes.  From my experience, personal connections are the best way to get access.  Make friends, help them out, give them a reaons to want to help you, and then give them a terrific script.  Every pro I know started this way, even the brand new ones.  There's a reason that so many working writers started out in some lowly show biz job, or socializing with other Hollywood types.  It's a people business."

Screenwriting,3a1n9v,k8powers,7,Wed Jun 17 01:40:16 2015 UTC,"Related: Don't ask people to recommend you to their agent or manager. Don't ask people for a job. Don't ask people you've never worked with* to recommend you for a job. What you want, ideally, is for someone to get the idea to do these things totally on their own because they realize you're awesome. Anything less than that will likely result in half-hearted help, avoiding your phone calls, escalating to avoiding you forever.  Do Ask: How did you break in? If you had to break in all over again, what would you differently? Can I pick your brain about your job (especially when ""your job"" is something assistanty) because your career is a huge inspiration to me. If there was one skill I should develop to help me through the next phase, what would you say that is?   Good icebreaker questions that will often start a conversation going: So what's it like working there? For TV people: Does your show have a room? How big is the writing staff? Are the days just crazy long? Do they send the writers to set? Have you seen (thing you're pretty sure is in their wheelhouse)? What did you think?  Pro tip: Look at the lower rungs of the ladder. The PAs, the assistants, the newly staffed writers. Don't be the undergrad whose list of desired mentors began with Joss Whedon and ended with J.J. Abrams.    Once you HAVE worked with someone, then it is totally fair play to drop an email now and then and say, hey, saw your thing, liked it, congrats on that shiny prize, etc. By the way, I just wrapped at (your last thing) and if you hear of any (job more or less like the one you did with this person), I'd be forever grateful if you passed my name along.  I frequently followed up with writer friends when I was on the hunt for the next assistant job. I NEVER asked them if they knew any place that was hiring writers."

And sooner or later, you'll be friends with people who think you're smart and interesting and when you say ""I wrote a script about X"" they'll say, ""Oh, I know someone who might love that.""   And even as little as being a Nicholl quarterfinalist can up your cold query results tremendously.    Also, for scripts that are not high-concept enough to have a one-line pitch that sells the read, how do you form an elevator pitch/log line that captures the interest of jaded readers/representatives?   You have to identify the people who might be interested in that script, and find a better way to logline it.   I've also leaned on my friend network. e.g., I have a comedy that is very hard to logline in a way that really captures what it is. But I can take it to people who already know my work and trust me, and I've had friends who love it say stuff like, ""Let me pass it on"" - where it's being handed to someone with a comment like, ""It's hard to explain, but I guarantee you'll laugh your ass off.""  But those relationships aren't people I met trying to ""network."" They're friends who are familiar with, and respect, my work."

Because you're really just trying to meet people you like, and want to work with.  I'd also say be generous with your time (when you can spare it). Help people out who you like and trust, and that's how you build strong relationships with people, and also keep your soul intact. Take the philosophy that other people succeeding isn't you failing. All boats don't always rise on the same tide, but if you keep this philosophy for long enough, what goes around will (eventually) come around."

My response would essentially be:  Work contacts: Don't overlook anything.  But that does not mean calling every single person you know, and flogging your material, and asking for favors. To me it means sitting down, having a conversation, getting a sense of their take on the industry, and letting things develop naturally. This also means being willing to support your fellow riders, read their shit, go to their staged readings, and be generous in your support.  I also think joining high quality writers groups can be a good avenue. Don't hang with the newbies, the scrubs, and the no talents. Go out of your way to find people at your level.  Also, even though I have heard my share of pros and cons, I am still of the opinion that amateur writers can find success on the contest circuit. I might be biased, because I personally have made some contacts this way.  I am not sure if you are correct about cold querying either. However, my plan is to get an upgraded subscription to IMDB, and make my queries more targeted to people who seem receptive.   Also the blacklist.  I also believe you are correct about writers Meetups, WGA events, reddit meetups and other social media platforms.  Oh, one more thing.

Screenwriting,3a1n9v,DickHero,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:34:31 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the jargon.  Matching singles means, they shoot close ups of all the actors and then in editing, the ""matching singles"" are continuity editing issues. For example, if Actor A is looking left, and Actor B is looking right, then in editing as they talk we cut between the actors. That's called ""matching singles"" because there is a ""single person in the shot."" Beyond that we get ""two shots,"" ""three shots,"" and so on to mean how many people are in the shot. During production we shoot ""coverage"" and that means we shoot wide shot, medium shot, close up shot, over the shoulder shot, and point of view. The Judge was edited in matching singles. Hard to know why. I assume they shot the whole coverage as per usual.   Heavy handed lighting can be many forms. In The Judge I can see how they tried to motivate all the lightning from exterior sources and used interior practical lamps as fill. That created lots of contrast. Then in color correction they turned all the dark areas even darker! And added orange in the fill light. This is called ""Rembrandt Lighting"" and or ""chiaroscuro."" And while all of the technique was executed expertly, the problem was the literalness between what the characters are saying and what they're showing on screen, like a PowerPoint presentation. The character is all, ""I'm so sad and my feelings are heavy,"" so they start playing the violins in the score and dimming the (fill) lights.   Stylistically, it was full of bad choices like that, yet the script was amazing!   For a different, and proper handling of transcribing script to screen, read and watch Birdman -- no matching singles!  Edit for spelling."

Usually writing is done in-studio so you won't see much talented being pooled from outside. That said, I can't guide you into a good career path for it other than working on your writing on other projects and then applying for a writing position at one of the game companies.  The major difference I'm trying to push between the industries is games and their stories are mainly conceptualized by the designers and producers and your job is to write something to make it work, rather than the producers looking for things created by writers."

Break it down into scenes, into sequences, give yourself the option of jumping around the story. Or, if you're strict enough to be able to do it, go work on something else and come back when things have gestated a bit and you feel the excitement again.  Doing both of these has really helped me. I have a bunch of things that are in my head, I focus on one, write down anything that interests me about the others, give myself two projects that I allow myself to work on. If I get bored of one the other is waiting, but I won't let myself start and stop six different things until one of the two is 'finished'."

Screenwriting,3a1n9v,King_of_Tacos,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:12:03 2015 UTC,"You can't ask a question like that sans context. Without any, I'd say cliche is only an issue when the scene isn't good. You're going to have bias, but think about it and ask if it satisfies you. If yes, then write it, read it again, get someone else to read it.  But, there's some saying that I can't remember properly. Roughly, a scene should progress character or plot or setting, and preferably more than one and ideally all three (I'm not sure setting is the third though).  But anyway, if your scene is establishing the plot and the character of your protagonist, great. You're maintaining pace and building attachment (hopefully).   The next question is why are you using a throwaway character? Are you certain that a recurring character cannot be used, what is the reasoning for having them appear for just a moment."

Should I be focusing on trying to write something short, first? Those of you with more experience, did you decide on a certain genre for a certain reason or just went with whatever you went with because that's what you felt like?  I started reading a book called ""Essentials of Screenwriting"" by Richard Walter. What are your thoughts on the book if you've read it? What are your thoughts on reading a book at all?   Formatting question: This is definitely in the ""too embarrassed to ask"" area. If someone is in a car, driving, do you mark that INT or EXT? What if you know that they will be in front of a green screen? Or is that part not something a writer worries about?   How many scripts does one write before starting to shop them or enter them into contests, looking for representation and what not?"
Screenwriting,3a1n9v,jusdifferent,2,Wed Jun 17 12:44:13 2015 UTC,"Cars are interior. Same concept as being inside a house and looking outside a window.  I decided on sticking to film dramas (action based mainly) because that is what I'm emotionally attached to. I can feel emotions in my writing in that style and I know I can write conversations well in that area because of it. I guess the key is to know what makes your writing unique compared to others and what you feel you can excel at based on your own personality or experiences.  I've heard a general rule of thumb is your first few-several scripts will suck until you start realizing things like good dialogue. It can vary. Also no reason you cant go back to those original scripts if you want later and make them good. Screenwriting is like anything else. There's some talent involved, but you only get better by practice."
Screenwriting,3a1n9v,poseymund,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:36:42 2015 UTC,"INT or EXT?   This really is an arcane problem in screenwriting. It isn't going away, but it is silly. It has to do with the Unit Production Manager's (UPM) budgetary needs: tungsten film or daylight film. Tungsten film (INT) renders the color white at a different wavelength than daylight film (EXT). Whether something is DAY or NIGHT will change the contrast ratio of the image, meaning the UPM will need to budget and schedule for the correct lights. To get even more arcane here, this month's American Cinematographers Magazine http://www.theasc.com/ac_magazine/June2015/current.php has an article on Mad Max and how the technique of shooting ""day for night"" has changed under digital image acquisition's specs, as opposed to how it used to be for film. Long story short: we no longer actually need to write INT or EXT or DAY or NIGHT because all of that can be changed in post production. (whew that was a lot, but it ain't over yet!)  So imagine a story where character A is inside his living room and looking outside. If the cinematographer wants to shoot the scene so that the FILM AUDIENCE can see both INT and EXT, a whole crap ton of stuff is needed. We call this ""matching light."" The basic question is: Do we buy tungsten film and gel the windows? Or do we buy day light film and light the interior. Which gels do we want? And so on and so forth. How does this relate to screenwriting? We write two slug lines.  INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY  Some GUY, a witty 43-year old know-it-all, looks outside his window and sees:  EXT. LIVING ROOM WINDOW - DAY (GUY'S POV)  Frolicking fairies fly fleetingly.  In editorial, these two separate lighting set-ups will cut together to create the illusion that GUY is looking outside. I added the parenthetical (GUY'S POV) to be as clear as possible that we are looking through Guy's eyes. Often that means the camera will be hand held or adjusted in post with a JavaScript expression.   At this point, we have enough information to understand what to write in your car scenario, not because we need to know which film stock to buy, but because we need to know what the character is doing INSIDE THE CAR and what is happening OUTSIDE THE CAR -- two separate lighting set ups. You can use other slug line formats to describe this. Here is one example:  EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY  GUY, a witty 43-year old know-it-all, drives fast as a bat out of hell. Or maybe a bit faster than that because he is being chased by a FLYING DINOSAUR.  INSIDE THE CAR  Doug's foot stomps on the GAS  OUTSIDE THE CAR  The flying dinosaur just barley misses a devastating blow.  INSIDE  He looks in the rearview mirror and sees  OUTSIDE  The flying dinosaur getting closer.  To be sure there are other techniques, and I feel it is really important to read this aloud to yourself to make sure the tone, pacing, and decorum produce the feel you're after. It may be that moving between the inside and outside make the read boring. Nothing is worse than being boring! So MAYBE all you really need is the EXT. DESERT - DAY and then just describe what happens.   Don't worry about green screen.  You can submit anything you want at anytime. You will take some lumps and it will make you stronger and better.

Screenwriting,3a4gao,devolka,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:12:10 2015 UTC,"I've been reading some screenplays here and there. Could you point out some ""no-nos""?"
Screenwriting,3a4gao,devolka,2,Wed Jun 17 15:57:08 2015 UTC,"Sure. Generally you want to remember that this has to be read and understood  by someone. So on page one, for example, are the young man and John the same person? You just want to be clear about stuff like that. Name your reoccurring  characters and describe them.   My general rule is that anyone in more than one scene gets a name. The Old Man here qualifies.  I typically give a name to everyone but ""service characters"".  Every character deserves an original  description.    Key an eye out for unfilmables.  Things you say in the action lines that can't be translated.  ""John lays in bed in pain"" can be translated to an action. ""John has tried to overdose on pills"" cannot. This is a big problem with new screenwriters. It's a habit you will want to avoid.  The last big one is keep the language active. You write a lot of ""begins looking"", ""starts fiddling"", is searching"".    Try ""he looks"", ""The Old Man fiddles"", ""John searches"". It's less passive writing.   On the subject  of your writing style.... you seems to be writing almost as if this was a technical document.  In a sense it is but it's also designed to give emotional  context. You tend to just write a series of physical actions.  You write ""John does this. John goes here. John does that"" Without any sense of HOW he does it.  There are also some bad sentences with missing words. Your actions lines should be complete  sentences like ones in a novel.  All this makes the writing dry. I'll give you an example. There is a line ""John begins chopping the wood."" This is okay but just barely okay and frankly, okay is bad.  Try this. ""An axe nearby, it's blade stuck in a tree stump. John pulls the axe loose, effortlessly.  He swings the axe like a natural  born lumberjack. He set a nearby log onto the stump and with a WHACK splits the log with one might swing.""    Now clearly that's a bit over board but it gives you a lot more info and a real sense of what the camera would film.  Hope this helps. Stick with it!!"

Anyway, I came from writing novels and I kinda assumed writing scripts would be more direct actions like ""John begins chopping wood"". I was kind of thinking descriptions/novel-like-writing was superfluous, as to leave discretion for the director.    But thanks for the advice! All of this is really helping, I think."
Screenwriting,3a4gao,Lefse_Cakes,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:07:07 2015 UTC,"About the writing: Not at all, you want to descrip as much as you can as long as it serves the characters and the plot. You don't want long winded paragraphs that don't  move things forward. In my example it would have to be important to the story that John was good or at home with the ax or whatever. It tells the reader something about John that is important.  Generally I think everything that you show should be relevant.

They only thing that will translate to the screen from this opening action line is a man sitting in hospital with florescent lights and a TV playing. This important stuff will not be there.

From the article:    I was able to secure a copy of Effie and felt it was distinctly related to my own screenplay in its time-frame, character development, structure and tone.   Gee - you think two separate projects about the same real-life person might have similar time-frame? Really?  That article also displays a remarkable ignorance of how Hollywood works. I mean, does he really think that if you send someone like Emma Thompson a script, she reads it?    My lawyer is forced to point out it is usual and customary for a writer to be paid 50 per cent at signing, the remainder to be paid on the first day of principal photography.    This is, um, not even remotely standard practice.   What is standard practice is to try to buy off a potential lawsuit cheaply with a small payment - even if you've done no wrong. Nobody ever seriously considers those things an admission of guilt, as the writer of this article seems to want to. It's simply a ""it's cheaper to buy you off than it is to fight a lawsuit"" strategy.   That article is so smeary and cheap.   And the Truman show thing - didn't Andrew Niccol demonstrate that he had started work on his idea before the play was produced or published?  Parallel development is a real thing. Terry Rossio has a great anecdote about it on one of his Wordplayer columns."
Screenwriting,3a13dd,HotspurJr,3,Tue Jun 16 16:51:17 2015 UTC,try to buy off a potential lawsuit cheaply with a small payment   I wrote coverage for a producer once who bought a script because it was very close to what he was developing. (The script was terrible.)

Screenwriting,3a13dd,all_in_the_game_yo,4,Tue Jun 16 17:07:28 2015 UTC,"So he claims.   The Gravity lawsuit is a great example of why it's best not to take one party's word on these things. And Craig and John pointed out on scriptnotes, the author was reading her own work extremely selectively to make the similarities sound greater than they were.  I don't know if this author has a claim or not. I'm certainly not going to take his word for it, especially in the context of an article which  engages in ad hominem attacks.   And even if the offer was made, it doesn't necessarily mean anything. e.g., let's say somebody at Emma's company did read the script, and passed on it. It never got to Emma, Emma never read the coverage, nothing. Emma then creates her own version. This sort of parallel development absolutely, positively happens (although of course we don't know if it did here).  In that case, the play author can make a lot of legal noise, because there is a paper trail that looks messy, even if actual plagiarism didn't happen. And the buy-out amount would undoubtably go up significantly.   The other possibility is areas where there is a connection, but not an actionable one. e.g., imagine Emma reads a review of the play. Decides not to see it since the reviews were terrible, but the review sparks her interest in the historical figure. So she writes a script. That's not plagiarism or theft, since ideas aren't protectable.   Do we know if any one of these scenarios happened? Of course not. But there are enough of them, and they are plausible enough, that we should not assume that the playwright has been wronged absent further evidence."

Cameron has very expensive lawyers.  If he goes to trial, wins but doesn't have a judgement requiring the other party to pay his legal fees, he could be out millions.  Much easier to give some idiot $30k to go away.  Third, I've said this before, I'll say it 1000x more.  EXECUTION is EVERYTHING.  If Cameron came across a well executed script, he'd BUY IT.  There's no point stealing a good script.  You want the writer not the script.  The script is an outline which is going to change 1000x more before production.  It makes no sense to steal a script.  And last but not least, it's not holier than thou.  It's more experienced than thou.  You have a twisted fantasy of what Hollywood is like and it doesn't reflect reality.

Enough common ground that whichever is released second will feel derivative of the first one.   The thing about this is that it doesn't even take any amount of malice on the part of the guy ""stealing"" your idea. He gets a spark and then comes up with a whole bunch of new things that fit his vision of a concept. He feels as much of a right to his script, much as it was inspired by someone else's, because he has put a great deal of effort in to write it, he hasn't just lifted all the stuff you wrote. Strictly speaking, no one is at fault when those two things eventually end up competing against each other.

Screenwriting,3a0qpw,Wearedondraper,6,Tue Jun 16 23:00:40 2015 UTC,"You've probably heard it before, but original content is key. This usually means we want to see a really good hook in the first twelve pages. Something interesting, unusual, ultimately, something that makes you want to read on. You'd be surprised how many scripts dawdle on for a whole act and you're still not sure what the actual premise is.   There really was a mixed bag in last year's submissions. I've just written an article about that for Lucy V Hay of Bang2write so watch out for that next week. Try not to copy or ride on the success of successful franchises. I believe there were a lot of scripts sent in that were similar to Twilight, Other Worldly, and LotR films that didn't go any further down the line. That said, I didn't read many blockbuster movies, and wondered what was putting off writers from tackling that successful genre.   Unfortunately, it can come down to personal taste when there's one or more really good scripts. I try to assess which ones I think will be more of a commercial success. After all, films are made for audiences, so I try to keep in mind what audiences will enjoy. This is something writers should be thinking about too. I'm afraid I can't tell you my personal fave's as we want to encourage every type of film.   Things that make me sigh are when I see that English isn't a first language, which sometimes means poor grammar, sentence structure and a ton of confusion to trawl through. This goes for everyone though, don't confuse the reader! Keep it clear on the page. You don't want the reader to come out of the story to question logic.   Huge paragraphs of text in both dialogue and description means that this is going to take me AGES to read it, so it better be worth it. Things spaced out thinly on the page can make a lot of difference.   Over description is pretty annoying. I know what a bar looks like, I don't need you to list every item in the room. If it isn't essential to the plot, it's just a waste of space on the page, and again, making me take longer to read it.    Those are just flaws in writing technique thought. What it really comes down to is whether you have a great idea or not.   Hope this helps."
Screenwriting,3a0qpw,RichardStrauss123,2,Wed Jun 17 09:09:01 2015 UTC,"That said, I didn't read many blockbuster movies, and wondered what was putting off writers from tackling that successful genre.   Possibly the fact that studios only want to make safe investments such as Marvel or DC comic book hero type films.  Or reboot existing franchises, such as Dino bore, Mad Max etc.  Funny. I am actually writing a blockbuster movie, yes I know pointless, but to me cinema should be epic, spectacular and mind blowing.  Not all the time mind you, cinema is many different things to many different people.  It's actually quite reassuring to hear people aren't writing blockbusters.  OK, so I may lose points for commercial potential, however,  I may gain some brownie points for having an original thought.  Huge paragraphs of text in both dialogue and description  are an issue for writers, I hope whoever has to wade through mine, (and I do try and avoid it), will at least give me the benefit of the doubt and read a few lines.  But as you said, if it is worth it, most people will.  Once again, thank you for your time and your answers."

If it helps with your writing, think each new shot on the screen = a new line on the page. Spacing out your action that way can also help pull focus on what's important exposition and what isn't."

As far as submitting animation, one of last years feature winners was an animation piece - Giants of the Valley, which certainly falls into the personal indie type of story and there was a high amount of animations submitted to the animation category as the format suits the length particularly well.   It quickly becomes clear that a script is meant to be an animation when you're reading it, it's more visual for a start and allows the writer to bend certain rules, opening up the concept into much exciting territory."

I'm giving this advice off the back of a play I did recently, which was based on the hostage situation in Beirut in the 1980s.

Life-story rights are somewhat of a misnomer because no one owns their own stories. Facts can't be copyrighted or trademarked, and, just as producers don't always need remake rights to make a fiction film based on a documentary, neither do producers technically need a subject's permission to make a movie or TV program about his or her life. (Think E! True Hollywood Story or, in the literary world, the unauthorized biography.) But studios that don't secure life-story rights from subjects are opening themselves up to potential lawsuits-claims of libel, defamation or invasion of privacy. Thus, life-story rights deals, at their core, are promises by subjects not to bring such claims against the studios.   http://www.documentary.org/feature/whose-story-it-anyway-obtaining-subjects-life-story-rights"

Screenwriting,39zxd8,Dutchangle,3,Tue Jun 16 17:24:49 2015 UTC,"Sure but that's a boring answer. It was a great, imaginative way to introduce exposition, but it only works in this specific example. So what to take from it? I suppose, find an in-universe way to load your exposition, and if it suits the tone then make it fun.  JW tried to do an exact parallel with Jimmy Fallon and it failed utterly. Why is that? Because JF is unknown outside of America and will time very quickly, because the sequence was less fun (unoriginal slapstick humour is going to appeal to a small demographic), because it felt shoehorned in and inappropriate considering people had just died."
Screenwriting,39zxd8,Asiriya,2,Tue Jun 16 19:22:07 2015 UTC,"I understood the JF sequence as being supposed to do EXACTLY what you're saying. The point of it was that celebrity endorsements are always unoriginal, etc. This was a major element of the movie, having fun with making JP a real theme park- and what crappy realities would that bring about? Stuff like that video!  And the contrast between death and goofy park cartoons, jimmy fallon bits, etc has always been a major part of Jurassic Park, hell it was probably the original pitch: ""Okay imagine a theme park with all the corny safety videos and rides... BUT IT'S FILLED WITH DINOSAURS! And they get loose and it becomes a terrifying thriller set in this goofy location! A lot of JW was trying to reference JP, to varying degrees of success. I don't think it was ever ""copying,"" but bad references can quickly become so.  To your question, I think what to take from this is: ""Make your exposition diagetic"" and more specifically, make it believable that your characters would want/need to learn this information themselves, and would want to convey it in the same way you're choosing to do so. The viewer then simply overhears and witnesses a believable educational moment.  Diagetic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diegesis  Don't educate the audience, educate your characters. Reference similiar methods of exposition that actually happen in real life: when are we often explained things? How are they explained in real life? Signs, intro videos, handouts, by a guy holding a sign, by asking another person waiting in line... all ways to introduce exposition while keeping it ""in-world."""

Screenwriting,39zxd8,jrwritesstuff,7,Tue Jun 16 22:34:47 2015 UTC,"Secondly, I loved how the sense of fear builds and escalates. From that moment where the vans come to a stand still in front of the T-Rex enclosure there is this dread that sets in and you're just sitting there in anticipation thinking ""what the hell will they do now?!""   I think there's several layers of this ratcheting-up-the-suspense, starting even earlier.  Arnold's visibly nervous (smoking) as they start the ride.  So is Hammond (sighing).  The visitors, having put their trust in a completely automated system that does the driving for them, putting even that out of their control, go through big, foreboding doors.  Immediately, things start going wrong.  In very small ways at first: car lights that won't turn off; a no show.  Already, the system's showing signs that it's not working as it should.  It's not foolproof.  As we go behind the scenes, Arnold noting these bugs makes it more tense; and then Muldoon shushes everyone, meaning even he is getting nervous and paying close attention now, as they approach the T-Rex paddock.  Another no show, even after goat-based enticement.  A lack of security lets the wayward visitors break the rules and visit a sick Triceratops.  Then a storm approaches, forcing them to abandon the ride altogether.  So already the test run has failed: ""two no shows and one sick Triceratops.""  The storm arrives, and their programmer starts committing industrial espionage, disabling most of the fences and presumably accidentally stopping the car.  Then you can have your dread as they reapproach and stop at the T-Rex paddock, in the pouring rain.  But you can't see the T-Rex just yet, oh no.  First we infer she's moving from scraps of information.  There's impact tremors.  The goat's disappeared.  Then, and only then, can you see her.  Her discarded goat leg; her claw, caressing the electric fence without incident; and finally her face, chewing the goat... and looking right at you for her main course.  That's how you slowly but surely escalate the audience's sense of fear."

Screenwriting,39zxd8,OceanRacoon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:22:55 2015 UTC,"I'll just quote this from another site, since I can't say it any better:    Let's start with the park itself. John Hammond is a billionaire phil(mis)anthropist who decides he wants to leave the world with something magic. So he creates an amusement park that is not only not magic, it's suicidal for any man alive to step foot on it who's not Chuck Norris.   A theme park whose theme is dinosaurs fully capable of killing anyone in a matter of seconds. Never mind that Hammond keeps a couple of the world's best paleontologists in his pocket with funding and champagne, he never considers consulting them BEFORE he makes his park, and only afterwards to gloat about it.The paleontologists- surprise surprise- tell him his park is ridiculously dangerous and he has a hissy.  But that doesn't stop him from sending them off on a tour, the very first tour, not only when there's a HURRICANE on the way and they're on a F! ISLAND, but sends his OWN GRADCHILDREN along with them.  Among the people he invites for his big premier is a mathematician named Malcom. Malcom is such a genius he not only predicts the park will go haywire and everyone will die, he also has the smarts to both go to the island and take the tour. Why? Because he wants to flirt with Satler, who would rather dig through triceratops sh!t.All he does for the first half of the movie is smart aleckly remind everyone that he's already prophesied the park's collapse, oblivious to the fact that he's in it and his attitude makes him a rather conspicuous dinosaur target.   Now, a few words about Ingen's corporate rivals. They couldn't have hired a more incompetent accomplice. A fat slob with a criminal past- whom Hammond forgives, but makes him pay by running the system pretty much all by himself. Because you know all Samuel L. Jackson is going to do is shout “motherfucker” a few times and whimsically remark “They deserved to die and I hope they burn in hell” when all hell breaks loose.  This company could have bought any of the geneticists and gotten the goods with little or no harm, but they arrange an elaborate espionage whose key operative is a guy who, low and behold, f! it up so badly the very idea of a Dinosaur themed amusement park will from now on be associated with death and calamity.   Now, why the hell did Grant, of all people, even go on this fucking tour? He already knew that Hammond had cloned Velociraptors, about which he knows more then anyone on the planet, but most auspiciously that they have a tendency to disembowel their prey and eat them alive. He even has one of their claws to foreshadow that raptors will go primeval on any ass they happen to come across. One of his objections to the park is that we don't know how these animals will behave. Really? BULLSHIT. You know EXACTLY how they'll behave. He knows raptor hunting strategy well enough to have saved Muldoon's life if he'd bothered to tell him. His expertise on Tyrannosaur optics saves his life more than once, and he keeps this specialized expertise now IMMENTLY PRACTICAL all to himself. The only reason I can think of is this. At some point Malcom makes a smart ass remark about paleontologists becoming extinct now that dinosaurs are alive and well. Grant resents this, and decides to go on the tour hoping that the dinosaurs will eat a few people (Malcom especially) and thus usher in his new career as a forensic investigator specializing in homicide by dinosaur. Think not? He doesn't warn Malcom about the Tyrannosaur's fatal vision flaw until AFTER he makes an ass of himself trying to lure it with the flare like a kid at a rave.   But yeah, it's a movie."

A lot of those points are easily challenged, but Crichton wrote the book to illuminate genetic engineering and how it would one day soon become a serious question and he did it in the most bombastic way, as usual.  What I found stupid is that they discovered the key to cloning, a groundbreaking and earth changing discovery that would forever change the meaning of life and death and identity...and they used it to make a theme park full of dinosaurs. They didn't clone human organs or people or food and animals to end world hunger or anything like that. They used this incredible technology to make a theme park for kids.

After 2 terrible sequels, I came to terms with the fact that I was going to have to lower my expectations and just be happy to see dinosaurs eating people. I do concede that the script was bad, I am just defending the movie based on it's more obvious merits.  The Dino-Warriors angle was a dumb idea. They kinda got off track of the story they started on which was about corporate greed and the profiteering off a parents need to give their children a better childhood without all the trouble of being parents.  BTW - The scene where the raptor and Starlord stared at each other at the end and he shook his head ""no"" was the worst take possible. They should have stared sternly and motionless with Pratt holding his ground and THEN the raptor runs off. He gave away all the power of the scene AND threw away everything the movie taught us in the first act about predator pecking order with one tiny shake of his head."

I worked at a theater when it came out as a 3D rerelease, and on one slow Thursday I sat in the empty showing of it right at the part when the Trex breaks out. The 3D wasn't much of anything, but I have never been so struck by a scene before. The sound of the rain, the thudding foot prints, and that god damn amazing roar gave me the shivers. And I got scared, too, and I don't scare easy. I even looked behind myself because of how perfect that roar was. It was the most intense feeling of ""being there"" that I've ever felt for a movie."

My favourite though is the final battle scene once the T-Rex throws the Raptor off itself.

Screenwriting,39zxd8,perhapslevi,2,Tue Jun 16 09:12:16 2015 UTC,"It seems like there's a lot of hate in this thread for Jurassic World. Which is fine, but people are comparing the two movies, and I think that's a bit silly.  The original was an adaption of the novels, and it was able to take liberties with the plot because of the transition from book to film. None of the sequels had this freedom, because they needed to remain constant with the first.  As far as sequels go, they couldn't have done much better than they did, in my opinion - and the same goes for Jurassic World, being both a sequel and a reboot of sorts.  The magic of the first Jurassic Park film will never be present in a sequel, because that magic comes from the awe it inspires - which a sequel can not do without either deviating too far from the story, or being a repeat of the first film.  But as if it isn't hard enough to make any sequel stack up to its predecessor, in this case Jurassic Park set the standard pretty high by being a fantastic movie.  It was smart. It developed the characters properly. It was boldly dramatic when it needed to be, but it was also subtle in places. The pacing was unusual, but worked beautifully. The music, the effects, the editing, the acting... Everything lined up fantastically.  For a monster movie, it was about as perfect as it gets."
Screenwriting,39zxd8,joe12south,2,Tue Jun 16 13:23:30 2015 UTC,"Jurassic World had every opportunity to be very, very good by building atop the first film.

Jurassic World doesn't have the same ability to surprise you with a dino reveal so it is an action movie. I think this leads to the biggest problem with JW which is the lack of character development, a feature also shared in the Alien comparison. In Aliens, most characters were there to be sacrificed to the action roller coaster and very little time was spent on building them up. In JW, we see the same thing where very little time is spent building anyone up but Aliens had the advantage of a returning character that we all knew. JW did not and the leads were given a cursory pass of characteristics.  At the end of the day, it was a fun ride that I enjoyed but it did not have the depth of Jurassic Park."
Screenwriting,39zxd8,stratofarius,2,Tue Jun 16 16:19:53 2015 UTC,"The interesting thing about Jurassic Park is that technically there's little to no character development. Dr. Grant is still the same guy by the end of the movie, so is Dr. Sattler, Malcolm, Hammond, heck, even the kids are the same characters. The only meaningful change is Dr. Grant growing to like kids, but then again he wasn't that big of a kid-hater. Yet, all the characters feel like real people.  It's like Ghostbusters, where the characters don't develop at all but they feel extremely full-fledged and stuff."

The wiki example actually isn't very good though. I'd say it's better described as:   random input -> provocative combination + suspending judgement for exploration.   So taking your example and making my own poor illustration, my random factor brain goes:   A man is a gardner. A man is a gardner po carpets [Looking around the room I noticed the carpet needs hoovered] A man is a gardner po grass is carpeting for outdoors. A man is a gardner who uses carpets instead of grass. A man is a gardner who fakes his gardening using tricks like using carpets for grass.   Letting it expand however it wants to:   A man is a gardner who specialises in landscape gardening and property management for infirm rich people.  Understanding that his clients will never venture far into their vast grounds, he cheats by using carpeting, fake flowers, and forced-perspective scenery to create very low-maintenance landscapes which provide the illusion of great work which he could never actually do. Later his realises that since his scenery obscures the actual grounds, he can remove assets and even rent out the land without the owners realising. Eventually this culminates in him erecting scaffolding around parts of the buildings with a false facade, in the name of maintenance and renovation, but actually dismantling and selling off the contents and structure of those parts of the building. (Indoors, forced perspective paintings are also used to replace the views through doorways and windows, etc.) As the occupant becomes more infirm, eventually all that is left is his bedroom, with the outside environment having become completely illusory.   Then, having reached an end-point, we review it to see if there are any useful bits we've discovered along the way."

The term was created by Edward de Bono as part of a lateral thinking technique to suggest forward movement, that is, making a statement and seeing where it leads to. It is an extraction from words such as hypothesis, suppose, possible and poetry, all of which indicate forward movement and contain the syllable ""po."" Po can be taken to refer to any of the following: provoking operation, provocative operation or provocation operation. Also, in ancient Polynesian and the Maori, the word ""po"" refers to the poporiginal chaotic state of formlessness, from which evolution occurred.

In that exercise it looks like you take the object and then expand out from it. The ""extraordinary"" bit is still left for you to come up with.   This approach is a method for coming up with the ""extraordinary"" bit. You have the object and then combine it with another independent, randomly sourced idea, usually a jarring one from a different context.

These approaches aren't ground-breaking I suppose (when you have quirky ideas, then ""pattern randomisation and overlap"" is pretty much what's going on), but they do provide a formal approach when the juice isn't flowing.  Background:  I've been playing about with creating ""active metaphors"" lately, to shape thinking for creativity, and I remembered I'd read all this stuff (for memory, idea generation) when looking for study techniques for school.   It's out of print now, but de Bono's The Mechanism of Mind had a nice metaphor for the mind as a ""memory surface"", which is helpful for coming up with new ways to generate ideas. Robert McKim's Experiences in Visual Thinking has also been useful. Both can be useful for leveraging juxtapositions of concepts and for generating actual visual scene elements."

I would say, though, that it is often the case that a writer can repurpose another tale (Shakespeare did it, Alan Jay Lerner did it, etc) in order to breathe new life (or better structure) into a contemporary narrative.  This is what John Truby talks about when he speaks of the 'designing principle'.

I started reading more big books of greek myths but very unexpectedly they turned disturbing, especially for a child. As an adult I rarely recall the story of the jealous goddess turning Arachne into a spider, however I do sometimes think of the way Zeus turned into a bull and raped a human woman in bull-form, and I still remember the story where Zeus began lusting after a ""beautiful youth"" then turned into a giant bird, swooped down and snatched the young man up, then proceeded to rape the kid in midair.

I get he's the terrorist-type. I get that he is this self-aggrandizing ""patriot."" But these types of ""messages"" are concise (e.g. ISIS). It's almost more thrilling this way. You give the audience a lecture, they are bored. You give them a short, concise message, that lack of information scares them.

If he's really trying to institute a sense of order in politics, he would take this very seriously. I think the maniacal serial killer is a trope that everyone uses. Make him smart. Make him cunning. Make him seem normal."
Screenwriting,39yg72,omgNSA,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:27:56 2015 UTC,"Great ideas. Thanks for the feedback.  The character I have envisioned for Uncle Sam is smart, but he's still a self-aggrandizing egomaniac. First thing I thought of was that he'd have written a speech months in advanced and agonized over it. I purposely made it a bit wordy, thinking it would be in his mind frame that he has to 'bring everybody else to the thoughts he's already had'.  What would you think about cutting out the middle like 4 paragraphs and just make it: 'Good evening... country on brink of revolution... tonight's broadcast' and then transition straight to the hostages?  Thinking in another direction, if I kept the speech the same but added some action lines in to break rather than him just staring at the camera the whole time would that help? What makes this monologue not work as opposed to something like this from The Newsroom?  I'll definitely cut out the laugh. It wasn't meant to be a laugh that he thought the situation was funny, it was aimed at the last line of 'god bless america' and the contradiction of the 1st ammendment... but it probably didn't read as such."
Screenwriting,39yg72,omgNSA,2,Tue Jun 16 02:44:32 2015 UTC,"FYI I find that Newsroom monologue very contrived. That's just me, though.  I'm always for less is more. But if we're going to compare Newsroom and this, there are a couple reasons why this doesn't work as well:  Newsroom scene is a public debate/Uncle Sam is a televised broadcast - even if news stations aired Uncle Sam's terror video, they likely would only show clips...what clips? The most shocking ones. ""If it bleeds, it leads"" type of thing. So I would reconceptualize how this would go visually. I study journalism, and I can only speak from personal experience, but if I was packaging this video to show to the public, I would show the hostages first and parts of the speech after. It's a sad truth that newsrooms nowadays spread manic fear. That's how ratings work.  I think your suggestion to cut out the middle 4 would work great. But also keep in mind that if this is being shown on a news broadcast, the news packagers ultimately have full control over what they can show. It can be cut, spliced, edited etc...So don't feel confined by what Uncle Sam's video is originally.   As for the laugh, it did read as such. I did read it as a contradiction of the 1st amendment. I still don't think that works, though. I totally understand what you're trying to do, I just think it is a lot more powerful if he doesn't laugh. It only adds to the allure of his insanity and to the severity of his actions.  What movie could be a comp to this? I'm trying to envision what style it would be in."

I watched the season finale of GoT and my little producer/writer brain kept clocking various budget-driven maneuvers, ways they kept the budget down, ways they re-used standing sets, stayed on schedule, etc. I honestly didn't think there was a single choice that hurt the story or adversely affected the audience's experience, but it was kinda all I could think about.   But I do still managed enjoy some stuff purely as a viewer -- Happy Valley blew my mind, for example -- and it restores my sense of wonder and enthusiasm. So it's a good thing that you were moved by something, that you love it so much you wish you could create something as powerful. Seek that out whenever you can, and let it wash over you.  Also, remember that it's completely fine to borrow and adapt from the stuff you love. GRRM is hip-deep into British history -- he's got the war of the roses; the last, hated Plantagenet/Targaryen king (we know him as Richard III, GOT calls him the Mad King); Robert/Henry VIII's fucked heir situation full of infidelity on both sides; dueling religions; a girl ruler who is pressured to marry for political reasons yet can't produce heirs and who everyone writes off because of her gender and on and on and on."

Well, not complaining so much as wishing you could write more scenes NOT necessary to your stories?? Funny, because most of us toil over scenes trying to make sure each is germane to story/characters, etc., essential to the momentum and trajectory of the story. We long to have scripts where not a single scene could be plucked, unmissed.   Maybe it's different in TV sitcom land, maybe not. Since that's not my bag, I guess I haven't paid close enough attention. But ... I'd still wager to guess that IF I was paying closer attention, and if a scene wasn't pertinent in some way, shape or form, I'd still scratch my head and utter some semblance of ""I don't give a shit about this.""   Maybe I'm just not following....... My initial reaction is: count your lucky stars and keep writing!!"

Screenwriting,39uwlb,ColinSays,2,Mon Jun 15 00:13:23 2015 UTC,I'd wear a shirt and tie just to show you care enough to do it.   They may also ask questions about what movies/tv shows you like. I interned at a high budget production company doing coverage and after I was hired they said they asked what movies the interviewees like so they know what preferences they may have while doing coverage. Obviously this company didn't want to have interns doing coverage that favored low budget art films and disliking high budget films.

I don't think a shirt and tie is necessary. I think a polo shirt, or button up shirt, khakis or slacks, and nice shoes is good enough honestly.   They will ask about your film and tv experience   Why you want to work in the industry   Why you applied for this specific company. Make sure you've researched all the producer's imdb credits etc. Point out how you appreciate the types of movies they make and so on. But don't sound like you're just kissing their ass. If you haven't seen any of this production company's movies, go out and buy a couple tomorrow just in case it comes up in the interview. And just so you have a feel for what they make.   What your long term goals are in the film industry. You said you're a writer so articulate that and tell them you enjoy doing script coverage as a writer yourself   Your passions and so on  What type of movies and tv you like. Try to give good thoughtful answers so it's not just something like ""Jurassic World cuz Chris Pratt is awesome""  Your strengths and weaknesses etc and other typical interview questions   Other work experiences you've had  Any experience with screenplay coverage if you've had any  Define what in your opinion makes a strong script and what you would look for while writing coverage   Then at the end they may ask you if you have any questions. Preparing a good question is a good idea. You can ask who all works in the office, what a typical day is like, what they look for in interns, etc.   Most importantly like someone mentioned below, since they've already read your sample coverage, this interview is mostly a meet and greet just so they know you're not a psycho and get a sense of the type of person you are and if you'll do okay working in their office.   I'm assuming you already know (sorry if you already know this but just wanted to point it out in case!) this but most internships are 100% unpaid without even a stipend or lunch money. Some offer college credit though. So don't ask in the interview how much you'll make.   I'd also bring a printed copy of your resume to the interview.   Make sure you give yourself enough time due to LA traffic and parking. The parking situation at their office could be just street parking and there might not be any spots nearby. Get to the interview early (in my opinion, a few mins early) but not 30 mins early or something out of respect for your interviewer's work schedule.   Also, make sure to send a thank you email to whoever interviewed you later that night or the next day. Honestly it'll set you apart from the riff raff.   Hopefully this helps! Feel free to pm me if you have any questions."
Screenwriting,39uwlb,ComradePiggy,0,Mon Jun 15 08:38:55 2015 UTC,"Some production companies usually have you do some test coverage to see if you're worth interviewing, so I assume you've already covered a few scripts for them and they liked what they read.  If that's the case, then the hard part is over. The interview is really just a meet-and-greet to see if they like being around you. Just show a genuine interest and excitement in working with them.   Be ready to answer some pretty standard questions -- 'What your goals are, what you want to get out of the internship, why you decided to apply with their company, favorite movies/scripts' -- things like that.  Based off my internship last year: if they like you, they'll hire you. So be yourself, be friendly, and don't sound like an idiot or asshole. Best of luck!  EDIT: Shirt and tie is not necessary, IMO.

Only use them if the context doesn't already tell us. For example, page 1, you tell us he's not sure what's so funny, then says ""Ah, good."" Both those imply ""unsure"" so no need to add it. The same goes for most of the parentheticals you use. Or things like ""(looking down at it)"", when caracters are acting, they'll fill in the gaps of the subtext of the scene.            (2) How did Mrs. Beliveau know that Peter brought flowers and have a cup ready? Why would the cup of water taste any different than normal water?         (3) Mr. Beliveau says the flower will be droopy, but Peter just said he was going to give it to her. How would it become droopy in that short of time?        (5) I'm not really sure what you mean by the passenger seat being laid down and pushed forwards. It seems overdramatic for her to mention it.          I think by TITLE you mean SUPER.        It seems you're cutting back to one week. I don't see why though. A lot of movies use this technique of starting with a flashback/forward to show the exciting things to come, but you're not showing anything exciting. You're showing a guy picking up a girl for a date or whatever. It's not exciting, and not worthy of ""showing the audience a sneak-peek.""           (13) It really seems quick for these people to be planning a trip. They've said like twenty lines to each other and she's already asking if they want to go have a trip to the beach, before they've even eaten breakfast?           (15) You have these really weird transition, where they're suddenly firing fireworks, but when, and where? It just seems out of the blue.           Why is she in his car in the morning? Did they hang out all night? Didn't she just take her home? Are they already on the run?            By page 25, I'm too bored. You'd think at the motel they'd totally fuck each other, but they don't. Not even a hint at some sexual tension. I thought they were madly in love at first sight, considering how quickly they are to go on a random trip with a person they just met, but there's no sign of it. It's 25 pages in, and nothing too big or important has happened. There's no immediacy and no danger. His mom calls him, but we don't even hear the message. Maybe even at least we hear his mom telling him what rough shit he's in for running away, as in some semblance of conflict, but nothing."

But to reiterate, I laughed out loud, and though if it were me I'd tweak some of the dialogue, I think you hit the style you were going for.

You could have a screenplay about Aliens fighting Dinosaurs and still have twenty people with the same idea.   My point is, you can't worry too much about that stuff otherwise you'd never write anything at all. Just try to make sure you offer as unique a viewpoint as possible with your script."

Not because it's too similar to whatever Spike Lee is working on but because it doesn't seem to have that unique angle that will raise it above other similar projects.   Look at some of the milestones in any genre.   Zombies? (I'm using this one because it has a shorter, easier to grasp, history but you can do it with anything. Cop shows. Medical shows. Sitcoms. Sci-Fi. Whatever.)  Night Of The Living Dead, a siege movie with flesh eating creatures instead of Indians.   Dawn Of The Dead, instead of it being a rustic house in the woods, it's an urban area with a big fancy place full of all the items you need.   Day Of The Dead, instead of it taking place immediately after the zombie outbreak happens, it set years afterwards.   28 Days Later, instead of the normal zombies, there's infected humans that can run and infect you with their blood.   Dawn Of The Dead remake, instead of the traditional horror/Zombie movie, Zack Snyder basically turns it into an action film with horror elements.   Shaun Of The Dead, instead of straight traditional horror, they do a zom-com.   Fido, it's a spoof on 50s culture with a zombie as the dog.  28 Weeks Later, it's the aftermath but it explores a family's (or more specifically a kid brother/sister's) struggles.  World War Z, instead of focusing on one area, the scale is global.

Send him an email saying words to the effect that ""you agreed that we would be co-writers on these projects, and both scripts contain substantial work by me.""   You're creating a paper trail, if one doesn't already exist. If the conversation you mention are via email or IM, make sure you keep copies, and remind him of what he agreed to.   Don't get in an email argument with him, but you're perfectly happy if he responds in some way that implicitly acknowleges that you worked on the material. (I mean, if you emailed the scripts back and forth, said paper trail already exists, but still).   Look, here's the reality:   If he tries to take your name off the script, and to cut you out of any possible deal, without removing your contributions from the script, he is infringing on your copyright.   He is also defrauding any producers or agents he might connect with. They would not look kindly on such behavior. If he were to sell the script, he would have to attest that the work on the scripts is his and his alone, and that if he knowingly lied about that, he's basically on the hook for any and all claims on the copyright of the script. They make you sign something to that effect.   In other words: you'd sue, and they wouldn't protect him. And he'd be personally liable for all damages involved.   I would do exactly what you suggest: inform him that legally, your contributions are yours, and that he can use them or not, but he can not use them and fail to credit you.   That being said, look: the odds of anything happening with this material are miniscule. Maybe he gets a read or two. Chances are good the script won't draw any heat. Chances are that this is largely a waste of energy. So establish your rights, state your position, and forget about it and move on. You don't want to be working with this guy anyway.   But, as always, the lesson is: don't just jump into a writing partnership with someone you don't know well."
Screenwriting,39tye0,HotspurJr,2,Sun Jun 14 19:50:21 2015 UTC,"I'm jumping in with a slightly different question.  I've been in contact with someone I met on a different screenwriting forum and we've been reading and critiquing each other's work.  Recently I read a script of hers that has potential but it kind of loses it's way and falls apart.  I've offered some advice for strengthening certain aspects, but I have an idea that would A) substantially change the direction of the story and B) tie together a bunch of loose strands that already exist.   How does something like this work?  I'm not trying to co-write and everything has been casual, but if I discuss these (extensive and detailed) changes with her and she uses them, do I have story by credit? She knows she doesn't have a strong third act and is looking to change it.  I just want to be up front with her about the legalities."
Screenwriting,39tye0,pijinglish,4,Sun Jun 14 20:28:38 2015 UTC,"People help each other out with scripts all the time, offering notes, suggestions, etc. It doesn't make you a co-writer, and it doesn't get you a story-by credit, unless you agree to that. I've spend multiple hours going over someone's work with them, and I would never DREAM of asking for any sort of writing credit for that work.   Unless you are a total doucheface, you will not make any claim on her in any way about these materials. If you actually wrote words, and they were incorporated, you might be in a position to make a claim (but still, look, when somebody asks you for notes, only slime bag tries to weasel that into something deserving of credit).   If all you did was give her verbal ideas, you have no claim to anything. Copyright only exists on things that exist in fixed form.   I am not a lawyer. But if you were giving notes to her verbally, with the understanding that you were GIVING them to her not as part of any sort of agreement, then they're hers to do with what she wishes.   If you were emailing notes back and forth, it is a tiny bit more complicated, because there is something which does exist in fixed form, but remember that ideas can't be copyrighted. Only the expression of those ideas. So again, if the understanding is that you two were just helping each other out, there shouldn't be any legal issues at all.   If you want some sort of credit on her script, approach her with ""hey, I'd love to partner with you on this as a co-writer.""   If not, and you want to avoid ambiguity, a simple email that says, ""My understanding is that we're both just helping each other out by batting ideas around, and that neither of us have any claim on the other's script. Agreed?""  It's not clear what you're worried about here. Are you worried that she might have to credit you? No, she won't. Are you worried that she might try to not credit you? Don't be a doucheface.   Batting around ideas is something that writers do for each other all the time. If somebody gave me a GREAT idea, which changed the direction of a script, and the script sold, I'd buy them a very nice bottle of wine. He'd probably be pleasantly surprised to get it.   This is what friends do for each other."
Screenwriting,39tye0,HotspurJr,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:30:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my intention isn't to be a douche. I've already given her (and countless others) detailed notes with no expectation of credit.  I'm only asking in this case because my ideas would fundamentally change the structure of about 60% of her script. I just didn't know what the expectation was or what she might feel obligated to do because of WGA rules.  Better to know in advance than deal with it all retroactively."

Screenwriting,39uc83,cynicallad,2,Mon Jun 15 20:26:09 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite exercises from film school is to read scripts for films that have been produced. Classics like Chinatown or something contemporary like Inception. Whatever films you enjoy watching. Read the script, then watch the movie. Do it with films you've seen before and with ones you aren't familiar with, but have heard are great films. I find it trains you to envision the words on the page as a film. It's a skill that will develop the more you do it. And do the same with bad movies. Reading bad scripts can be just as helpful in developing your understanding of film.  Scripts are different from books, essays, short stories, etc. in that they are not meant to be the final form of the story. They are a technical document for making a movie that tells the story, so while reading it can be enjoyable, you should be imagining the movie it will become."

Screenwriting,39u091,Elegba,4,Sun Jun 14 20:25:45 2015 UTC,"As a screenwriter, you don't generally add these. But as someone who started with production and then began screenwriting, I feel it's always a big advantage to know the process, especially if you have been tasked to rewrite anything during production.  Scenes are numbered when the script is locked for shooting. When a script is locked, this becomes the copy production and different departments work from, and great care is taken to track any additional revisions (eg colored pages).  If you have Scene 25 and 26 and production decides a scene needs to go in between you do not want the scene number to change through the entire script so the new scene becomes 25a. http://www.scriptchick.net/Info/Revisions.html breaks it down. The film I'm on right now is currently on the goldenrod (edit: now buff as of this afternoon) revision and we have quite a few of these inserted additional scenes.  The benefit with knowing this when reading shooting scripts is that you have some idea that these scenes were added to improve how the story was told. It's a great little study tip to look into the decision process more deeply.  That said, this revision of JAWS isn't the greatest example since it's still fairly early. It was re-written extensively on set because the shark barely worked and would be down for hours or days for repair."

The show eventually was not a success. But the experience was profound. George Abbott, the legitimately legendary Broadway figure, was the director of the show—he was closing in on seventy-five during our months together and hotter than ever…He was coming from backstage during rehearsals, and as he crossed the stage into the auditorium he noticed a dozen dancers were just standing there. The choreographer sat in the audience alone, his head in his hands. “What’s going on?” Mr. Abbott asked him. The choreographer looked at Mr. Abbott, shook his head. “I can’t figure out what they should do next.” Mr. Abbott never stopped moving. He jumped the three feet from the stage into the aisle. “Well, have them do something!” Mr. Abbott said. “That way we’ll have something to change.”"

I've read Save the cat, Writing Movies for Fun & Profit as well as stuff on the web but I still haven't gotten the grasp on what the logline is supposed to tell about the plot. Form Save the Cat I got that a logline has to have a hook/twist and imply a whole movie. The second part is what's hard for em because I don't want the logline to be to long either"
Screenwriting,39t5d3,ComradePiggy,2,Sun Jun 14 17:34:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, don't focus too much on the logline. Its good to have but it doesn't need to be so rigid. The How-to books make it seem like it HAS to be one sentence and so on and so forth but if it's two sentences that's fine. The most important thing is we get the character, what the inciting incident is, what the main problem is, and what the tone of the movie is.   I think your loglines are mostly good but what the others said, we only get the set up and don't really have any idea what the last 3/4 of the movie will be about.

Everything 'fit together' IMO, and even if the material was self-indulgent to some, I don't think it was ever superfluous.  My pick might be just as unpopular, but I think Cloud Atlas is a better example.

Most people will look at the title and become interested, but not immediately know what it is about (causing them to want to read hte screenplay and find out).  The trouble with this method is, it is really easy to fall into using bad puns and idioms.  Which I personally dislike.  But many other people love it.  So if your target reader is looking for comedy or you're making a comedy script, go for the pun or gag title!  If they seem more serious and 'artsy', go for a more serious title or even an ironic title.  As for how much time I put into my titles, I usually just think of it randomly while writing.  Usually right after finishing the core development or character interaction of the screenplay.  Then I try to get my title to tie into that."

Another Netflix show, Bojack Horseman, is my favorite show and I think the first few episodes are good but only about as good as any other adult cartoon (but also weirder). Then you sink into the universe and the characters and the story suddenly become real, yet still hilarious, and you totally forget that you're watching a cartoon of a bunch of anthropomorphic animals.  But half a season or more of just shit is, like you said, a chore and not really worth it. I know that shows can't be perfect. I actually think we expect too much of our entertainment nowadays.

Screenwriting,39q2aq,Rayman323,6,Sat Jun 13 18:15:09 2015 UTC,"From a fan perspective (and this is pure hypothesis), I have to imagine a lot of the interest/appeal is that not unlike Lost (but in a much more ramped-up fashion), Sense8 offers a little something for everyone. It's easy for people to forgive a show for its faults, flaws, or underperforming aspects if it can resonate with them personally. In this case, the LGBT community is poorly represented in television/film in general, but Sense8 has multiple characters for them to rally behind. POC across the spectrum, too, can find someone that looks like them, is identifiable.  I mean, I'd be a liar if I, too, didn't say that I let Sense8 slide a lot because I just welcome the refresh infusion of ""different"" (I, too, am only on episode two, but I'm not disengaged just yet). The overwhelming majority of my media consumption is white-centric by virtue of the state of the industry. It's exhausting, boring, and same-y to me. I also remain hopeful about the premise, because it's a super neat concept, a hive-mind of sorts, and I want to see it play out interestingly.  But yes, the first episode's problem is fundamentally a structural one, in which there are far too many narrative arcs to introduce or touch upon to give viewers any time to connect with any one. The pacing is less hectic by episode two, though, and I found myself enjoying it more for that reason."

Screenwriting,39q2aq,JJBell,3,Sat Jun 13 21:11:15 2015 UTC,"What is it with all the ""Why did everyone like this movie/show I hated"" threads on this sub lately? Anyway, I'll bite. I'm afraid that I can't change your mind about the Wachowskis because this show has convinced me that they've lost it. And yet, I don't think they're terrible by any means. I haven't watched the Matrix sequels since they came out in theaters, so I can't really talk much about them. V for Vendetta was a mediocre adaptation, but a very good movie. There's some stuff I love about Speed Racer, and sometimes I like it and other times it just doesn't sit well with me at all. I really wish we could've gotten Alfonso Cuarón to do it with the J.J. Abrams script way back in the 90s, but the Wachowski's movie has a charm to it that I really enjoy. I haven't watched Jupiter Ascending, so I'm making this chronological disorder by connecting Cloud Atlas and Sense8 because I think they share the same problems.   Cloud Atlas has tons of great things in it; the stories are beautiful, the performances are great, the visuals are outstanding, but man does this movie throw a middle finger to itself and the audience in terms of pacing. The novel in which it was based on had more of a Russian doll type of structure and it worked really well and I think the movie could've followed suit. Because as it is, the movie barely allows you to breathe in or take in anything of what's going on. It's exhausting to watch and when I watched it in the theater, I was ready to walk about but that movie snuck up on me and I ended up on the verge of tears when it was over. But reading the book made me realize it could've been edited so much better.   And Sense8 has the exact same problem; each episode throws you around from character to character, and situation to situation and it doesn't allow you to really take in what's going on. It's needlessly cacophonous in this way. If you can get past that, you will find that the individual characters are fascinating as are their stories. I got pretty hooked on the show. The Wachowskis and Straczynski were very smart with their cliffhangers at the ending of each episode, and they truly knew how to build momentum. But the structure of each episode is all over the place in a way that I don't think was really necessary.   And as the show went on, I became thoroughly disappointed by it; As a Mexican, I was very happy to finally see a story about Mexico that doesn't involve drugs and presents other aspects that are constantly overlooked in movies and Lito's boyfriend was probably my favorite secondary character. But I was really, really disappointed by how Daniela was reduced in the show. She essentially becomes a damsel in distress and it was completely contrary to how her character had been established. And the white savior plotline with Gorski bothered me as well. And damn, is the whole mind link thing used as Deus-ex-machina over and over. It's fine once or twice, but after that it becomes exhausting and predictable.   I liked that the show ended on a note of mystery, but I wonder if it was really necessary to do that. Overall, I think I'll wait on buzz about the second season to check it out. It's not really horrible, but the Wachowskis and Straczynski need to rethink their execution at least a little bit."

Screenwriting,39q2aq,RNGd_in_the_womb,2,Sat Jun 13 20:27:55 2015 UTC,"The acting, and dialogue are corny. Both are trends that will last for the season. The first episode sets up the overall plot as having this big mystery behind why all 8 main characters are interconnected, which feels on some level like trickery to make me feel that the overall plot is important.  However, thematically, the show is all about interconnectedness and how we can benefit from having multiple worldviews. The Wachowskis and Straczynski really invested a lot in character development, and after finishing the season, I feel that this made up for many bad points that the show has in its early episodes (including the simplistic overall plot). Although these characters (some or many) may not feel real, but the theme of interconnectedness really adds to their collective charm. With that said, it's a show that feels like an optimistic outlook on many things currently happening in this world (SJ movement, the Internet weakening narrow worldviews, et cetera), but not one that I would recommend to everyone.  IMPORTANT EDIT: i really liked the cinematography! looking back on the season, i don't remember a single bad shot. however, i'm pretty sure all of the slo-mo scenes might have turned off a viewer, or 100. even so, i thought they were cool and somewhat necessary to show all of the transitions in the sensate communications."

I see more Directors coming through the episodic TV sets I work on then Transpo goes through donuts at Crafty.  TV Directors sit in a chair, and for the most part, the shows run themselves.  The DP knows the style of the show, and the actors know their characters.  No Director is ever on set pulling out great acting from his cast.  Thats some film school bullshit that is left over from the days Kubrick pushed his actors on his sets.  Thats why they have directors come and go weekly on tv shows.  They are the captain on a ship that is run by GPS, weather warnings and the corporate office onshore.  Remember, the Cinematographer used to be the Director, and somewhere along the line, the Director position was made seperate. The Wachowskis are worse then M. Night.  They had 1 hit imo, thats it.  ""Who let the dogs out"", and the rest of the discography is terrible.   M. Night collects alot of hate, but he put out several great movies, a couple mediocre ones and Air Bender.  Yet the Wachowskis or better regarded.   Guess M Night should have cast Keuno,  cause that guys amazing energy makes everything ok.

The interpersonal relationships between the characters create a variety of conflicts, and the resolutions aren't ""fair"".  The story lines where good doesn't triumph suck people in because the modern audience is groomed to think that good will always triumph.  Mix in a multitude of different characters with conflicting motives, add some tits, and some cgi and violence, and well it delivers on pushing the emotional buttons of the audience.

There seem to be only a few creatives out there who can make this sort of film happen anymore (Nolan and the Wachowskis, among a few others) and when one of those stumbles (like the Wachowskis have so often lately) I really think it creates negative ramifications for the rest of us screenwriters and filmmakers.  Not sure where I was going with this, except to say that...damn, Wachowskis...you have got to do better. Captain America can suck, and he'll get another movie or three. But there's never going to be a Jupiter Ascending II."

Before Reddit gets my I.P and nukes my house, let me justify that statement.   Group of unreleated misfits who are all in a bad situation are somehow tied together (AKA, super powers) All have their own self-contained story which soon intertwines with each other (Sense8 doesn't do this well. Some stories are just utter poorly written bullshit) Cop Guy Who Discovers He Has a Moral Compass #000435766 stars on both shows, yet the cop story in Sense 8 is bullshit. Both have some kind of mysterious secret plot that runs in the background.  They're all from different parts of the world.   It feels like someone took what was good about Heroes, added some philosophical message to justify its existence, then executed it via firing squad and released it.  However, that's all my opinion and I have no right to stop you or any others from watching it, just my two cents."
Screenwriting,39qsii,daJamestein,0,Sat Jun 13 22:37:06 2015 UTC,"I agree that the show is similar to Season 1 of Heroes (which btw I also thought was great).  But I disagree about Sense8 doing a worse job of intertwining stroylines: I actually think that's something Sense8 does really well, thanks to the nature of the powers. As I said, a couple of the individual storylines didn't work for me-- until they became intertwined with other characters.  Whereas Heroes very often felt disjointed well after most of the characters had met (e.g., Hiro's Season 2 storyline).  Also, I think a key difference from Heroes is that in Sense8, the ""mysterious secret plot"" really isn't that important. Sure, there are a few villains floating around, but they don't dominate the season the way the Company and Sylar did in S1 of Heroes. In fact, this season of Sense8 focused on the characters so much that I think it will ultimately be viewed more as an extended prologue.  btw, I have no idea why you think the Cop Guy story is ""bullshit""-- yes, he had a quicker awareness of his powers than the others, but given his physical encounter with and subsequent guidance by Jonah, that made perfect sense to me."

It doesn't reach the heights of the original but there's some really suspenseful horror scenes and some fun set pieces. It's also not afraid to poke fun at itself. However, the script is limp as hell. The characters are blatant stereotypes that would've felt dated 20 years ago. They have zero depth and all of the character's arcs are poorly crafted. They basically skip from act 1 to act 3 of their development at the very end. It reminded me a lot of the recent Godzilla.

Screenwriting,39np7s,apocalypsenowandthen,6,Sat Jun 13 04:46:30 2015 UTC,"Some spoilers, beware  Finally! Some cohesive responses that patch together my ""unpopular"" opinions quite well.  That being said...  I thought the new ""Jurassic World"" movie was surely a gimmick for the audiences, an unfortunate testament to the recent trend of CGI-saturated blockbuster-moneymakers that directors label cinematic.  In all honesty, maybe it was the offset of the eight-or-so trailers that preceded the movie - all with the same Hollywood cliches -- you know, the opening boom, the pretentious reverberation of subwoofer speakers, the voice-over cliches from a character (""It's something mankind has never seen before"", ""So what'll we do now?""  or the occasional banging on a desk in frustration) or maybe the fly-over million-dollar shots of Los Angeles that fade in and out...ALL from which, in its entirety, Jurassic World did not care to stray.  But cliches aren't bad! Just the really trite brother-affection, flirtatious disaster-survival and hopelessly bizarre transitions in dialogue (i.e. Chris Pratt's several ""Ok guys, we had our laughs, but now it's time to move on."") B.S. exemplified so much in the movie -- but again, some of it was cool.  (mostly large scale) The T-Rex, the tale of two young children overcoming their woes. But we all know, as movie-goers, that the power of a script lay in its inner dialogue. The small stuff. Instead of the inexplicable ""it needs more teeth"" nonsense, where was the ""Life finds a way?""   Now, I'm not one of those pretentious critics that says he can make a movie better than whoever. But I am the moviegoer, and I can tell you that it's not necessarily Jurassic World's fault for not getting its act together.  Yes, you mentioned the improvements that could have been made in the scriptwriting, yet as mentioned above, it's only subject to the recent trends in modern filmography.  Maybe it's because ticket prices are more expensive that modern filmmakers want to incorporate more CGI, y'know, so the audience can get its money worth. But I digress... But who needs progression anyway?  It's so overrated  -- says the once apathetic teenagers as he cradles his beloved young brother in his arms.  This must have been a mutual love harnessed from the impending divorce which we were so made aware of in the beginning of the film whilst the parents got along and acknowledged eachother.  ""I googled it."" Tears were shed.  One other thing I felt to touch upon is the music.  I'm a musician by trade, (lol) and while I completely admire Mr. Giacchino's signature musically boyish charm that emanates so well through his Pixar movies and the touchy-feely melodious heart-throb scenes in Jurassic World, the fight scenes, of many, were not quenched with satisfactory background thrill.  In fact, when it died down, I immediately calmed down, and I fell out of the movie (but wait, the dinosaurs are still fighting!). We all know the reliance the audience has on a movie's score, and it was so noticeable in the lethargic, driveless ""fight"" music in scenes such as the last fight scene.  Also the common musical device of ""paraphrase technique"" -- AKA paraphrasing a motive found in another work, hmm sound familiar?  The first movie's themes came out and prevailed, and the signature ""T-Rex"" theme had its 4-second debut, but as for the bulk of the score, the atonal dissonance and the ""new"" melodic ideas (based off the old ones) that Giacchino tried to lure his audiences with just didn't work -- of course, what needed to be understood was the culture of Jurassic Park -- and this includes the score.  I'm 100% certain the audience wouldn't have cared, or even noticed, mind you, had the infamous Jurassic Park score played through the film in its whole duration.  Because to be honest, those were the themes everyone was singing walking out of the theater.    But don't get me wrong, Giacchino did an excellent job incorporating his musical expertise into the film.  Just my own measly opinion on what could have been a different take on the same concept. I'll always admire him and his works through time and time again -- after all, the movie did have an underlying theme of boyish charm, anyway.    But as for the ""fun ride"" aspect, you essentially hit it on the head.  It was fun to watch with my dad, once, in the theaters; I got the thrill, I felt like I was there, I lived.  But there was so much attention that deserved to be given to this masterpiece.  Something beyond CGI and way beyond the walls of the ignorant audience in the theater (Hell, what do we care?  Explosions and dinosaurs).   Just something we need to pay attention to -- especially with this recurring popularity of reboots.  Sullying the reputation of a once long-lived family special?  Worth the CGI expense.   It might just be a getting-used-to thing, this new trend of CGI worship that overtakes focus rather than depth of story structure, but once we conquer it I assume we'll be in the golden age of filmmaking.  I hope... well, you know what they say....  Life finds a way.    ...See what I did there?  Was that worth it??? I hope so..."

I thought it was fun and nothing in particular pissed me off about the characters too much. The kids weren't as good as the ones in the original clearly.  Except for Vincent D'Onofrio's character. I remember years ago reading that one of the initial drafts of the script had half human/half raptor super soldiers going rogue, and obviously elements of that were retained, which was just stupid. Who could possibly think that fucking dinosaurs would ever make good soldiers? And it was such a pushed part of the film. They could have come up with a better way for the raptors to hunt with them.  I think that's the sort of muddled story telling you get when you have 5+ people writing a film, not even doctoring it, you can see the amount of people credited at the end.

I just don't understand how they could think releasing equally if not more dangerous wild dinosaurs into an already desperate situation is a solution, it's too unpredicatable. Get everyone off the island, wait for it to turn up/attract it somehow and shoot it with rocket launchers. Why would you even try find it in a tangled jungle in the middle of the night, that's never going to end well"
Screenwriting,39np7s,OceanRacoon,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:51:00 2015 UTC,"The raptor bike scene absolutely horrified me in the trailers but I thought the whole arc with them was the strongest part of the film.  It's been established they are smart, they can communicate, they have a clan. Once you accept all of that (we've had 14 years) it isn't a huge leap for someone to impose themselves as alpha, strengthened by the conditioning set up in JP1.   I thought the establishment of Pratt as the insecure alpha worked. He's been training them, they are listening but when their obedience is actually pushed they are still quite wild. Fine, they aren't ready yet.   A bit more work and the bike scene would have been perfectly acceptable. Get Pratt on the bike to make him larger, louder, more imposing. A solid alpha. Get the raptors away from any distractions, then release them. Have the squad follow behind so the raptors don't have reason to turn immediately. Then have an actual authority challenge on Pratt by the IRex. Pratt is presumed dead by all, raptors go on a spree...  Releasing the raptors is obviously a stupid idea, but if the film had been set up in a way that things could have been more contained I could see it making sense. Pratt is going to the IRex to lure it to a trap, the raptors have sedative implants, there is no radio interference to stop a signal. Focus stays on the IRex threat. I suppose then we wouldn't get the 'Giant Monsters All-Out Attack' at the end."

I didn't walk inside the place as a writer. I walked inside as a fan who really wanted to see some dinosaurs fuck some shit up. They fucked some shit up. The sound inside the theater was incredible, the action was great, and there were even a few lines that actually made me laugh. I loved every single minute of it.   Would that still be the same if I watched it inside my living room by myself? No. This movie must be watched inside a theater with your best friends.

Full disclosure: I am a pretentious snob.    The family dynamic was a waste of screen time. It could have done without the kids entirely. The I Rex was not frightening enough to carry the film. Almost every single time it showed up on screen, it was sticking its fat stupid face into some place it didn't belong and sniffing or blinking. I didn't find any of that particularly threatening.   The CGI felt weightless.  The T Rex was effectively neutered into a deus ex machina plot device that posed no threat after helping kill the I Rex. That being said, its introduction was pretty cool, but still left a bad taste in my mouth once all was said and done. Also, it totally should have eaten her ass since she was running at 2 mph.  I feel like pterodactyls wouldn't fly halfway across an island just to throw some people around. Didn't they eat fish? WEAPONIZING MOTHER FUCKING VELOCIRAPTORS. What rational human would possibly think that was something worth considering? This was one of my main problems with the movie. I feel like so many sequels to american blockbusters fall into the ""weaponization"" sequel concept. It's cliché, and such a cop out. I can't be the only person that thought this was incredibly stupid.  The soundtrack really failed to connect with me, but I admit that might just be me.  This really felt like a dumbed down action movie instead of a suspense thriller like the first (and even the other two sequels!) What contributed to the first two sequels' admittedly subjective enjoyability was partly the sense of isolation. None of that in this.  Chris Pratt really did his best, god bless him, but that character was flat as hammered shit.  I think, most of all, the greatest offense was the concept. It suffered from joke-on-a-joke syndrome, and just mutilated everything we got out of the ending of the first JP and regurgitated it back up in a much more convoluted and much less eloquent package. It was the Jack Marston to Jurassic Park's John Marston.  Can't women be childless, successful, and serious about their job without being frigid, humorless automatons? Something about that bothered me.  Edit: I really want to emphasize the subjectivity of everything listed here. I don't disrespect your opinion if you liked the movie, I just haven't felt this let down by a movie since the Amazing Spiderman 2.

Dispensable side character/babysitting assistant runs and gets devoured within seconds, main character running in high heels no less, outruns T-Rex as well as rabid genetically modified dinosaur. Must be some mode setting we weren't aware of...   WEAPONIZING MOTHER FUCKING VELOCIRAPTORS. What rational human would possibly think that was something worth considering?

Screenwriting,39np7s,frank_rabbit,9,Mon Jun 15 13:31:29 2015 UTC,"Jurassic World is more of an action-comedy. It's plagued with cliche after cliche, repeated imagery (count how many times the I-Rex's jaw slowly comes into frame), and relied too heavily on VFX. It looked like a video game in some instances.  The first Jurassic Park pretty much shaped our view of dinosaurs today. When you see a T-Rex fossil in a museum, you think of the T-Rex from Jurassic Park. When you hear the word 'raptor,' you visualize the raptors from Jurassic Park -- 'Clever girl.'  I don't want to come off as too harsh a critic, but the believability of the Jurassic Park universe is gone. It's no longer grounded in reality. Which was expected, especially after watching the trailer, but still disappointing. I enjoy a good sequel if it's done well, and I was actually looking forward to the screening, but the Jurassic Park franchise has completely lost its magic."
Screenwriting,39np7s,dpergs4,2,Sat Jun 13 04:35:35 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree with this. The threat in Jurassic Park was real because the entire premise was grounded in reality. You fuck with nature and it comes back to bite you in the ass. This made the fear real and as the audience you felt that. Jurassic World does none of this. When you have Raptors being trained like circus elephants and dinosaurs ""talking"" to each other, none of that threat feels real. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park were menacing because they were primal animals we couldn't predict not because they were circus animals on the loose.."

Good Morning Vietnam, Patch Adams, Awakenings, etc etc etc.  People going to see this movie were promised this following:  A likeable hero.  Check.   Dinosaurs fighting each other.  Check.  Kids in peril.  Check.  High quality special effects.  Check.  A couple funny lines/scenes.  Check.  So, people are happy.  Sure, the script could have been smarter.

Also, the babysitter character was one of the most ridiculous things I've seen since Furious 7. In it for five minutes, you forget she exists, then comes back to be mutilated. Bryce Dallas Howard's character barely broke two dimensions, part script, part performance, but there was no reason to believe that this was a family instead of just actors pretending to be family.  The fact that it's a ""monster movie"" is not an excuse, especially following in the footsteps of a phenomenal trilogy of experimentation. The first film having the strongest story, the second sacrificing some story for the increase in spectacle. The third was mostly spectacle and honestly has no third act, thus ending abruptly, but there was still believable cause for going into danger. Jurassic World tried to brush over that fact, but there was honestly no believable reason for there being a park there in the first place."

Screenwriting,39np7s,chimpaman,8,Sat Jun 13 01:59:46 2015 UTC,"Here's my attempt at a breakdown.  I'm going off of memory and the Wikipedia summary, so I apologize if I get some details wrong.  In the dinosaurless opening scene we are introduced to the two brothers: the younger Gray and older Zach.  We're told Gray really likes dinosaurs, but that's about it.  There's no emotional content there to understand him as a human being (just an 'average American kid').  Zach is a spoiled, disinterested, horny teen who would rather bury himself in his Beats™ headphones than spend time with his family.  We see the fault, but there's absolutely nothing there for us to like.  The only one who shows some personality is the mother, who at least has SOME of personality.  She has a love of family that motivates her decision and emotional state.  Alas, she stays behind.  So they take a quasi-futuristic monorail in, the kid stares out the window in amazement, the iconic score starts to play.  OK... I'm on the edge of my seat, ready to be blown away by some dinosaurs.  But no, the big reveal is a freaking strip mall.  JP gave me a brontosaurus, and JW gives me a Starbucks? Whatever, maybe they were being ironic.  I didn't see any evidence of that, but let's see it play out.  In comes Claire, the anxious woman-in-charge.  She proudly touts a project to create a new, genetically-designed dinosaur to some eager Wall Street caricatures.  Woah, so BDP is the villain?  That's an interesting choice.  Oh wait... nope.  Apparently she's the quirky female lead.  Her nephews (the two brothers) are visiting for “family time,” so she pawns them off to some nanny-type and goes back to work.  We're introduced to a couple intriguing minor characters.  A marginalized technician/comic relief who waxes poetic about the glorified “old park” before all these unnecessary bells and whistles, making Claire uncomfortable.  Nice!  I've been waiting for some self-awareness.  I wish there was more of him.  He's a conduit for our nostalgia.  Then there's Misrani, the eccentric, helicopter-piloting billionaire CEO and successor to John Hammond.  He has a romantic point-of-view that clashes with Claire's cynical business-oriented one (“spare no expense!”).  I think I get this character.  I'm on board for more scenes with him.  But we're not done introducing characters.  Owen (Chris Pratt) trains raptors and saves the new guy from getting eaten.  Very cool.  He doesn't completely have their trust or loyalty yet, but I'm assuming that comes over the course of the film (or not). And now for the functionally retarded villain, Hoskins.  He has a plan to sell velociraptors as military weaponry, which is one of the most ludicrous evil schemes I've ever seen, even for camp standards.  In no universe would this happen.  It's like if a kindergarten teacher gave her students crayons and told them to draft new DoD policy.  Or if Kenny Powers was a high-ranking defense contractor.  Anyway, he sees the raptors nearly rip their trainer to shreds, which is all the evidence he needs that they're ready for battle!  Owen says no.  Hoskins whines.  Oh, and Owen dated Claire once, but it didn't work out.  Of course we need romance between them.  Gray and Zach tour the park with the aloof caretaker in the background.  Zach's too cool for school.  He doesn't care that there's a god damn T-Rex behind him, which we don't get to fully see (balls still blue).  Mom is upset that the kids aren't spending time with their aunt, and calls to complain with some gratuitous tears that come out of left field.  Claire promises to spend time with them, but I guess just goes back to work like the conversation never took place.  I have to say, I did love when the mosasaurus jumped out of the water and ate the shark.  I can't credit the writing for that, but it was kickass.  And finally, something worthy of Zach's attention.  I forget why, but Owen and Claire wind up at the genetic freak super dinosaur (Indominus Rex) enclosure.  I-Rex fakes escape by scratching the walls to make it look like she climbed out and masking her body temperature, so she wouldn't be picked up by thermal cameras.  Because what better way to track a 6-ton, cold-blooded lizard than heat signatures?  But I digress...  It's around this point that I started to bail on the movie.  I was able to tolerate a LOT, but something about a dinosaur devising this plan to fool thermal cameras didn't sit well with me.  Dinosaurs aren't people.  They are wild animals, hunting us on instinct.  Dangerous, but innocent.  Raptors are clever, but not geniuses.  Their escape “plan” involved shocking themselves with electric wires and remembering weak points.  It's coherent within the world's internal logic.  Now let's look at I-Rex... how could she possibly know she was being tracked by thermal scanners?  The only way is if she caused the handlers to react each time she did it.  But that can't be the case, because they've never seen her do this before.  God, there's so much I don't understand here.  She would have to know the handlers would come in to look for her.  I know people will say I'm overthinking this, but that's the point.  I don't want to be.  The only way to make sense of it is to read I-Rex as a sentient savant, which isn't the Jurassic Park I know and love.  Little did I know, this personification was only the tip of the iceberg.  Anyway, the dinosaur kills some morbidly obese guard who let it escape, but Owen can hide because he's crafty.  Masrani and company drag their feet keeping people safe, because they're awful human beings.  At this point we lose Masrani's character.  The passion for keeping the dinosaurs and people are happy is gone.  He sends in a task force with non-lethal weapons to take down I-Rex because he wants to protect his $20M investment.  It's the opposite character motivation we were given before.  If the intent was to show us his “true nature” (not that it was presented that way) then how about giving us more than two scenes with him.  There's no reason for me to give a crap.  Predictably, I-Rex kills the task force.  Oh, and she can camouflage.  Misrani confronts Wu, the lead scientist from the original Jurassic Park who has apparently turned into a mad scientist.  Wu has been keeping I-Rex's superpowers a secret for some contrived reason.  Misrani acts like he had no idea that any of this was going on.  I forget what his angle was, but I remember being really confused.  Someone reminds Claire that two of the people she might inadvertently murder are her nephews, who are riding around a herbivore exhibit in this sweet invincible hamster ball thing with an instructional video presented by Jimmy Fallon of 'The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,' 11:35/10:35C on NBC (a division of NBCUniversal, a Comcast company) or check local listings.  Claire calls them, but gosh darnit, the plot just won't allow the reception to be good out here.  Zach ignores calls to go back and they take their hamster ball OFFROAD!  By the way, I should mention an earlier scene in which a tearful Gray tells Zach that their parents are getting a divorce.  It has no relevance to the plot whatsoever.  Anyway, the brothers get caught in the middle of I-Rex battling some other dinosaurs.  There's a cool looking set piece with the kids bouncing around in the hamster ball, which proves not to be very invincible after all.  The kids narrowly escape I-Rex by jumping off a cliché into a pool of water.  Claire recruits Owen to help save her nephews.  She defiantly screams out her nephew's names with the I-Rex still on the loose and ties her lab coat into an 'action' midriff, completing her transformation into Willie from Temple of Doom.  One wonders who would put this ditz in charge of running a Burger King, let alone a billion dollar theme park of deadly monsters. Zach and Gray wind up in the old park and hotwire one of the old jeeps, but I was too really enjoy the nostalgia.  At this point, it felt exploitative.  There are some more set pieces.  I-Rex is making her way down to the strip mall where they herded all the sheep-- I mean parkgoers.  She kills a long line of dinosaurs in her path “for sport.”  This is an evil dinosaur, guys.  Unlike the other films in which the dinosaurs follow logical instinct, this one has an emotionally scarred soul, because that's what Jurassic Park is all about.  On her way to the strip mall, she crashes into the pterodactyl enclosure.  Misrani to the rescue!  He pilots a military helicopter because the CEO is logically the ONLY one capable of operating one of the company's own vehicles.  Claire even asks “But who's flying the helicopter?”  Yes, Claire, that's the question on the audience's mind.  We need answers.  Alas, Misrani's aerial operation fails when pterodactyls escape from the enclosure and blow him up.  Misrani's death devastates Claire.  When I saw her crying I really wondered if the film wanted me to root for Misrani.  After this next part, I went from being disappointed to genuinely upset.  The pterodactyls escape and storm the parkgoers at the strip mall.  I'm digging the set piece and all, until the human brigade comes, led by Owen, to shoot the pterodactyls from the sky.  I know there's some throwaway line earlier about there being “non-lethal” weapons, but this was violent.  I'm sure they were being killed without emotion or remorse.  What's the morality here? What am I supposed to take away from this?  Where's the ethos?  It's an ideological departure from the series I love.  I could go on, but Reddit won't let me write any more."

Screenwriting,39np7s,kickit,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:42:15 2015 UTC,"I largely agree.  The set pieces were a lot of fun, but the biggest problem for me was the lack of strong characters, and the utter lack of consistency with regard to the raptors--they switch allegiances like 5 times in the third act.  Also, I was fine with the first scene of the commandos going in to hunt the I Rex, even though it was a carbon copy of Aliens.  The commandos wear POV cameras and life-line monitors, while Chris Pratt (fka Ripley) tells Bryce Dallas Howard, who's ostensibly in charge but actually out of her depth (fka Lt. Gorman) to ""get them out of there!"" just before the monster reveals it was hiding in plain sight and starts killing everybody, while our main characters watch in horror over video monitors as all the life monitors flat-line.  Yes, it's the same exact scene, but Aliens was almost 30 years ago and most people in the theater have probably never seen that movie, I'm old, fine, I get it.  But then an hour later, they give us basically the same scene again!  They get a bunch of new commandos from Vincent D'Onofrio, and this time it's with Chris Pratt riding a Triumph motorcycle through thick jungle (?!) with the raptors, and once again, the commandos all get their asses handed to them.  What was the point of doing it twice?  And what the hell was BD Wong's character?  Was the whole thing with him escaping with the embryos just to set up another sequel?  So stupid.  Also, am I crazy or does nothing the main character (I think the protagonist was Bryce Dallas Howard?) directly affect the plot until the very, very end, when she releases the T Rex?  The entire 2nd act is her enlisting Pratt to help save her nephews, but the boys make it back to the park all by themselves (by fixing a 20 year old, rusted Jeep in like five minutes--apparently all they had to do was swap out the battery...?!).      Oddly enough, though, I didn't mind the weaponized raptors thing.  It's so tropey, and D'Onofrio sells it so well, that I just went with it."

Don't come to /r/screenwriting[1] and bitch when people don't like shitty scripts, or worse, bitch about in depth script reviews   Lol, now you're being the dick. Sorry I didn't get into specifics on why I don't like this kind of evaluation, but most of it comes down to the 'universe realism' brand of nitpicking that really doesn't matter when it comes to writing scripts. Grabbing one quick example:   And now for the functionally retarded villain, Hoskins. He has a plan to sell velociraptors as military weaponry, which is one of the most ludicrous evil schemes I've ever seen, even for camp standards. In no universe would this happen.    It isn't fair to say the cheesy villain has a cheesy villain scheme because that's the point. This isn't any more campy than Loki bringing space monsters from another dimension to attack NYC, at least in my book. I honestly don't see much evaluation of 'the framework of the story' so much as whining about cheesy plot details being cheesy plot details. If realism mattered to Hollywood, they wouldn't be making movies about dinosaurs and superheroes to begin with."
Screenwriting,39np7s,Asiriya,2,Sun Jun 14 14:04:36 2015 UTC,"I disagree 1000%.  I LOVE old Hollywood movies, and there's a level of craft separating the good from the bad.  As screenwriters, we should be able to dissect the story to see where it succeeds and where it fails, and this forum is a good place to do it.  No, this isn't a movie review.  I'm writing to screenwriters, not NYTimes readers.  We should hold ourselves to a higher level of critique and not write off JW as a ""goofy summer blockbuster,"" because that's an extreme disservice to what we do.  For instance, let's look at the original Jurassic Park.  Everyone remembers those characters because they were so freaking good.  John Hammond had a passionate goal and vision.  We may not ultimately agree with him, but we can ultimately empathize.  Ian Malcolm is arrogant and offputting in a lot of ways, but he establishes himself as the voice of reason and moral center of the film, crushing dreams that deserve to be crushed.  Dr. Alan Grant has a heart but also a relatable flaw that we root for him to overcome, because it's how he can end up with Dr. Sattler (they make sense as a couple).  There's emotional depth in the subtext of him connecting with Tim and Lex to overcome unpleasant memories from his own childhood.  His intense love of dinosaurs makes him vulnerable and likable, and we feel something when he sees the pterodactyl flying alongside them.  Dr. Ellie Sattler is compassionate and strongwilled, but human.  Digging through one big pile of shit without missing a beat or complaint tells us so much about her character.  Even Nedry and Muldoon were great and memorable because of the efficiency and consistency of establishing their characters.  Who are the characters in JW other than bland archetypes?  They are inconsistent, indistinct, unlikable, unrealistic and cartoonishly archetypal, lacking in drive or passion, detached from any sort of emotional arc, etc.  Jurassic Park was an absolutely brilliant script and the gold standard for Hollywood monster movies (at least up until the midpoint).  Every little thing had a purpose, and sometimes two or three.  For instance, take the moment in the helicopter where Grant ties two receptor ends of the seatbelt together.  1) It's a moment of levity that makes sense given the tone of the scene. 2) Shows us that despite all the glitch and glamour, the park ignored a simple safety precaution. 3) Established Grant's ingenuity. 4) Showed Hammond's eagerness for everything to go smoothly.  5) Played up the sexual competition between Grant and Malcolm.  6) “Life finds a way” metaphor.  All that accomplished in a few seconds of screen time.  For all their faults, even Lost World and JP3 didn't ignore basic character development and had consistent themes that staid true to the franchise."

It's not even internally consistent.   He sends in a task force with non-lethal weapons to take down I-Rex because he wants to protect his $20M investment.   The investment thing is ridiculous. What is more important, a $36m dinosaur or the entire fucking park. Those are the stakes, they are quite clear to everyone. It makes no sense not to go balls to the wall and make sure it can't do too much damage. Just the apatosaur  slaughter in the meadow would have been $36m...  And besides, you might only have had two IRex hatch but you're telling me there aren't other embryos in storage? Especially if this was all apparently some military plot to breed weapons...

Zara was barely in the movie, but I liked that she was obviously in a position she didn't really want to be in. Plus, the little tidbits where she was planning for her wedding as everything else was happening.   Dr. Wu, whom already had an appearance in the first one, came back here as more developed. He's a guy that has conviction for what he's doing and will protect his job at any cost. He believes he's doing the right thing.   Hoskins, who I feel might have been too one-dimensional. He's a very traditional movie villain in that he's never expanded upon. But the guy is a psycho, and all the more interesting because of it.   Lowery, who functions in a way as a fan surrogate.

Screenwriting,39np7s,TheStinger87,2,Sun Jun 14 03:59:55 2015 UTC,"I thought the movie was great, and from a writers perspective, I was actually pleasantly surprised about how layered it was. The central theme, to me, was all about order vs chaos, and how we only maintain illusions of control, but are actually not in control of anything. All the characters who died were all about control and couldn't let go of that illusion. By accepting that she has no control and that she is subject to the laws of the natural order as much as any thing else, Claire survives.  Zach and Gray's parents getting divorced may seem cliche, but that's the tragedy. Divorce is a common real-life monster that kids have to face today, and despite this divorce remains a voodoo topic of conversation and a great many kids have very little resources for coping in a healthy way. By including in the real-life horrors with movie monsters, not only can we juxtapose the two but the more observant movie goer might see that we're being shown how to survive in this era of the broken family. The boys don't have a hero in their family. It is made up of people obsessed with control and obsessed with presenting an illusion to hide the disorder, as in the parents sending the kids away and not even telling them flat out what's going on. To survive the boys need each other. But what else?  Owen represents that classic male role-model. He is one with the beasts and accepts his role in the natural order. He takes charge and does what he needs to to protect his own. He freaking tames the monsters that were in my closet as a child. But he doesn't control them, it's about ""mutual respect."" Owen is the type of role-model the children need to look up to in order to survive in the ""wild"" of their life. He shows that in order to survive the monsters we must see them on an equal playing field and work with them rather than against.  When Claire releases the Tyrannosaurus she has fully embraced the disorder and the chaos, which reins supreme. Now there's something more to be said about this, but I haven't got it all worked out. It's important to note that it was the woman who brought the Rex. And let's not forget that gender roles is a topic of the first movie.  There's also something going on with the old park vs new park dichotomy, but I'm not sure.  Why many of you don't like the movie is really interesting to me. For if you take a look at the first film you could apply a lot of the same complaints, but then again, you haven't provided anything specific to defend. In fact, I have no idea what it is you wanted from the movie. But maybe you were trying too hard to just avoid simple nostalgia. Bummer you couldn't enjoy it more. But taste is taste and just because you write doesn't mean you automatically can decipher the ultimate subjective quality of a movie after one sitting.  The main characters are and really should be the dinosaurs. There is a lot more value in certain characters actions than in what they may say. Even so, there were some fantastic monologues that really drove home the theme and Crichton's original concepts that were in the book but left out of the other movies.  And then there is that. Was Michael Crichton high brow in his writing? No, he wrote made-for-film science fiction. With Jurassic Park, he made a modern era Frankenstein story, to both warn of the dangers of modern technology and of humanities illusion of control. It's no Nabokov or Shakespeare or whatever, but it's a story that's needed and it strikes a cord in people. What else should there be?"

It was all over the place.  The story was literally all over the place also. It's family drama, coming of age, comedy, horror, action, and thriller. Filled with cliche lines.   Oh god the casting. So much miss casting. Howard was completely wrong. Lapkus was did not make any sense for that. jake Johnson (i like him a lot) but he was meh. The kid actors were fucking awful. The bossss were all kid bad. The only likely actors and characters were Pratt and his training partner.   Literally the same action as the JP. Example the kids in the sphere ride vs the hybrid t-Rex and the kids in the car vs the t-Rex. I'm sure some people will say ""that's an homage"". no it's if you your making a remake. Also homages are subtle not so in your face.   Oh the scene where the older brother was like hey remember when we helped grandpa with his Malibu. But there was no evidence of them ever working on a car ever. The first time we see the older brother he should be working on a car.

That said, it is tough to get the right things in place.  Even an experienced talent like Garland tried his hand at a Halo screenplay and couldn't get it right.  So, with blockbuster ideas, it's tough to get a good story or a good writer who is passionate for said concept.  Also, doesn't help that the director has a lot of say in Hollywood.

Nothing felt really connected in a way that made sense. There were also so many plot holes that I couldn't ignore them all. Why did the velociraptors almost kill Chris Pratt for signaling them, but then magically decide to be obedient and follow his motorcycle? Why was the park's failsafes so terrible on all fronts, to be somehow even worse than the original Jurassic Park's? etc.  What I got out of it was: this was a visually flashy movie strung together by cardboard cutouts of personality tropes I was supposed to feel some sort of connection with (I didn't).

Jurassic World is essentially what happens when Hollywood has an IP property where the story/world was so good that it was a massive hit and they want to continually milk it, but the problem is the setting is a contained setting...all be it compelling/// That's what they are banking on, but no matter what the story will be bad. This is due to the fact that you have to recycle it...or come up with some stupid variant to keep the show going.  Once you start recycling a setting like JP you REALLY have to bring something new and exceptional on the character story level and make it connect and resonate.   What's to connect with on Raptor whisperer?  Nothing. It's ridiculous. Doesn't make any logical sense, and clearly is only there as a means to provide a solution to the story.  The characters aren't characters who are the human story we connect with.  They are merely plot moving stand ins.  To compare.  Look at Hammond and Dr. Grant in the first one.  What is the real story with those two.    Hammond's real story is about someone who so badly wanted to create something great...that he didn't think about the consequences of what he was doing.  Thinking that he had control of nature itself only to realize he never had control in the first place, and in the process endangered his loved ones.  Dr. Grant. was a man consumed with his work about the past that he had a real lack of understanding the future...specifically kids...until he is trapped with kids in an effort to survive does he realize that they the future is just as important as learning from the past.

Screenwriting,39np7s,mrRiddle92,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:36:59 2015 UTC,"I think that Jurassic World is pretty solidly written, though the finished product is definitely stronger than the script.  It has some crazy moments, for sure. And I do get the whole ""why would anybody ever think to weaponize velociraptors?"" and ""why would anybody think to create a super-dino?"" arguments, but I think they have just about zero weight to them. Why are those things off limits when creating a living-breathing-people-eating dinosaur theme park isn't? Or an unrestricted dinosaur habitat? I understand that some people have some qualms with these concepts, but they are no less plausible than the premises of the original film and the first sequel. Especially considering this film takes place in a universe where dinosaurs are very real and have been public knowledge for 20 years. And Jurassic World has been open and fully operational (and apparently enjoyable!) for some time now as well.  Moving past the concept, JW hits the JP themes perfectly. In JP we had ""life will find a way"" which manifests itself in JW in different ways: the various character debating control and accepting a lack thereof; nature conquering science via the natural dinosaurs ultimately defeating the super-dino; and the raptors being unable to be ""domesticated"" for lack of a better term. JP also deals heavily with Grant's initial distaste for children being worn away by his kiddo companions, which emphasizes the parental instinct as the natural way of things. In JW as well, the family unit emerges from chaos and conflict. Owen and Claire readily step into the roles of protectors of Zach and Gray, even though Owen has never met these kids before and Claire obviously isn't very close with them. She even goes so far as to pawn them off onto her ambivalent secretary (whose failure as a maternal figure/guardian is rewarded with a grisly death). And last but not least, we see the dangers of hubris in Wu and Hoskins. Dr. Malcolm surely would've had plenty to say to them if he were around.  The characters aren't the best or most complicated characters ever written, but they're not bad either. Owen is the resident dinosaur expert and a born leader, but he's got a soft and goofy side (because he's played by Chris Pratt, of course) and a natural protective instinct. He's also a military man (he was in the Navy, I'm not sure if that was obvious in the film) who is opposed to a lot of aspects of the military-industrial complex (and consumerism, based on his jokes about the Verizon Wireless-asaurus) which adds a touch of depth. The audience likes him and respects him right away. The kids are great too. Zach and Gray represent different stages of adolescence that we've all been through (certainly geared more towards male viewers, I concede). Zach is obsessed with the opposite sex; he's too cool for school. Gray is still filled with child-like wonder, but he's vulnerable because he hasn't had time to build the emotional walls that Zach has. They're family is falling apart, a crisis which becomes all the more literal as their ""family vacation"" turns to complete shit when things start trying to eat them. Zach and Gray aren't especially close at the beginning of the film; Zach seems to view Gray as a bit of a burden, while Gray thinks Zach is a wet blanket. They open up to each other when the divorce comes up, and soon after they are forced to run all over the island together to stay alive. They end up closer than ever before.  Claire is definitely the weakest character. She's a professional woman whose never had time for a family. Blegh. But the film makes it work by giving her the Grant-esque character development from reluctant host to surrogate mother. It's a weak arc, but it's there. And it's a throwback to JP, which I think makes it a little more understandable. She also contrasts well with Owen, and they have a solid dynamic which drives their romantic narrative. The explicit romance subplot is a new addition to the franchise, but it doesn't take too much screen time and it's incorporated well into the ""family unit"" story. ""Your boyfriend's a badass"" was a great line to signify the transition from ""Zach & Gray and Owen & Claire"" to ""Zach & Gray & Owen & Claire"" for the home stretch.  In my opinion the main pitfall of the movie was the general underestimation of the velociraptors. JP2 and JP3 were much worse, but it still irks me to see how far the raptors have fallen since the original. In JP1 the raptors are the greatest threat. The T-Rex is the Act II obstacle, but the Raptors are the true force of evil (THEY CAN OPEN DOORS!!!). In JP2 and JP3 they range from comic relief (defeated by a gymnastics routine?) to moderately dangerous at best (worst?). In JW, they are at least given the respect they deserve as vicious hunters. BUT: they are also implied to be partially domesticable and form a questionably strong bond with Owen. The twist that I-Rex was part raptor was great, because (even for just a few minutes) the raptor was properly regarded as the ultimate predator.   The secondary pitfall of the movie was the lack of T-Rex. T-Rex is way cooler than I-Rex and I will never believe otherwise. Personally, I hope JW2 (as good as a sure thing at this point) is all raptors and T-Rex. We need new objectives, new obstacles, and new stakes, not new dinosaurs.  I understand a lot of the criticisms of JW, but I think most of them are pretty flimsy. And I think that a lot of the real issues with the film are smaller problems that don't really detract from the movie as a whole. But I will readily acknowledge that the directing/acting/scoring/etc. improved upon a less-than-perfect script. But to say it ranks anywhere among the worst written films is nothing short of absurd."

It was surprisingly meta as well and on-point with their observations. Dinosaurs don't excite anymore, they need something new, bigger and fresh. That was the underlying theme of the film and it's true. Jurassic Park worked back then as a safari-adventure park. Nowadays you need more. It's a heavily commercialised theme-park à la Disney World where children can pet baby diplodocuses in a petting zoo or ride small triceratops in a paddock.   To me it was the best film since the first one. While it lacked a little bit of the philosophical aura of the original it was damn good with some real scares."

The whole draw of the film is the dinosaurs. And honestly, I could have done without the destruction porn. Three hours of Jurassic Parks and Rec would have done it for me. How much more fun would that have been? Everyone loved the wise-cracking control room guy, he could have been in it more! Chris Pratt machoing around and trying to train the raptors (and trying to be shut down), Misrani being a Branson-esque dino-bro. Man, it could have been sweet. JP didn't need to stray into pure action. It should have stayed fun and cerebral and sciency.

I thought it had some fun visual imagery (a bit of it was overdone and rehashed, like the ""only dinosaur mouth comes into frame"" thing). For example, when the living, breathing T-Rex crashes through the fossilized T-Rex, made me smile in the theater. Clever stuff.  Gotta say though, the extended sequence where the secretary is killed made absolutely no sense to me. It was literally just senseless violence, and not the kind you really enjoy in these movies. Generally, when an ""innocent bystander"" is killed, you at least set up that they kiiinda deserved it (you know, he littered, or he kicked a dog, or he made fun of Michael Meyers or whatever), but I didn't get the feeling that Zara had done absolutely anything to draw the ire of the audience, and thus be punished in the film. I also got a huge disconnect from the audience behind me, who laughed at the scene. Oh well.  Also, you are most definitely exaggerating. By ""worst written films I've ever seen"", you really mean, ""most lukewarm written film I've ever seen get a 70% on RT"""

Screenwriting,39pqc1,bobbo1701,-1,Sat Jun 13 15:56:44 2015 UTC,Really? How was Caleb's ending resolved? He is left in darkness and in a way punished for his deeds.
Screenwriting,39pqc1,adesimo1,11,Sat Jun 13 16:35:19 2015 UTC,"It was completely resolved.  Nathan created Ava to manipulate Caleb. Ava used her tools and programming to successfully turn Caleb on Nathan. Even as an audience we thought that Ava actually cared for Caleb, but she was really just using him to her own selfish ends.  Caleb may have thought he was acting of his own free will, and in service of someone committed to him, but he was subtly manipulated from the beginning to give Ava everything that she needed. And once she no longer needed him to escape, he became at best useless, and at worst a liability to her.  It's sad that we'd grown to care for Caleb and he was left to essentially starve to death in isolation, but there were no loose story threads and nothing left ambiguous. Fair or not, his ending was directly caused by his actions in the film."
Screenwriting,39pqc1,adesimo1,-1,Sat Jun 13 17:07:50 2015 UTC,When I said unresolved I was referring to the outcomes of both Ava's interactions with the world and Caleb's certain death in solitude. Maybe I guess I was too overwhelmed with what was happening to accept Caleb's fate without physically experiencing it with him. In hindsight I can totally see how it's resolved but literally when the movie ended my first thought was is this a setup for a sequel? I guess I haven't allowed myself enough time to reflect on it.
Screenwriting,39pqc1,Sawaian,3,Sat Jun 13 17:29:55 2015 UTC,"I suppose there is room for more stories in this world, but I'm afraid Caleb won't be in them unless as a flashback.  I was a bit bummed (although completely satisfied) with the ending, because I had for a while actually believed that Ava had genuine affection for Caleb.  It was kind of a shock to realize that Caleb didn't really have very much agency the entire film. He was just being manipulated by Nathan and Ava. Don't get me wrong, he made definitive actions of his own volition, but under false pretenses.  He thought he was administering the Turing test, but he actually was the test.  He thought he was freeing a thoughtful and caring Ava from a tyrant, and that they would run away together, but he was actually unleashing a cold, manipulative facsimile on the world. And ultimately at the expense of his own life.  Poor guy. He deserved better, but we don't always get what we want, or deserve."
Screenwriting,39pqc1,PartlyWriter,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:40:18 2015 UTC,"Personally I hated Caleb. He suffered from a superiority complex that was unjustified. Throughout the film he keeps quoting the words of other people and acts like he knows what is really happening. Interestingly, I do not find Caleb a good person. He doesn't seem to recognize what Ava actually is, a work in progress. Instead he humanize a her, but under a specific category in which it appeals to his sexual desires. He thrives off of the fact of being in the position of power, meaning, Ava being his Damsel in distress. Caleb is also insecure. He views Nathan with a certain amount of envy which is deflects in his mind with these quotes and know it all attitude. He is the weakling who fantasizes of being the Hero. And Ava is the subject to his objective. He does not really see Ava as a person but as a means of justifying his weaknesses. To him, she can solve his problems of inadequacy. So I find him grossly incompetent and self righteous.   Nathan was the better human being overall. He legitimately had concerns for Calebs well being(to a degree, and this could be argued.), the feeling was not mutual. The psychological damage Nathan would have done was simply an effect of the experiment.   Anyways, I thought the film had resolved itself as soon as Ava leaves. Caleb was simply a tool to get out, and Ava proving Nathan's own genius.  Great movie for me."

Screenwriting,39pqc1,Dofleini,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:54:45 2015 UTC,"You know, it wasn't until reading this question that I realized why the ending was actually brilliant. I remember thinking it was bold, but it also left me a bit unfulfilled - as if something were missing or as if I missed something.  Now when I think back on it, it may be a subtle - or not so subtle - commentary about the fullness of human consciousness. Yes, the Oscar Isaac character creates a successful replication of human intelligence, but Ava has no sense of morality or true empathy. That's what's missing for her, and potentially what would be missing in even the best AI. She looks back at Caleb, her ""savior"" and has no regard for how cruel her decision is. She has escaped, and that's all that matters."

Screenwriting,39pqc1,papercrane10,3,Sat Jun 13 22:15:41 2015 UTC,I thought the ending was great. It was similar to Her where we know something has changed but the movie cant go into detail on it. It would take another two hours to show the after affects of robots integrating into society.
Screenwriting,39pqc1,ElandShane,-5,Sat Jun 13 16:00:31 2015 UTC,The ending of Her was great because we as the audience accepted the fact that Samantha was gone at the same time as Phoenix's character did. With this film the AI has a sudden unexpected change in character and loss of interest in Caleb. Its just a confusing twist when we have been investing ourselves in a similar relationship.
Screenwriting,39pqc1,hrgilbert,5,Sat Jun 13 16:41:58 2015 UTC,"Except it wasn't a ""change in character,"" it was Ava's true nature. She wanted to be free. She was playing Nathan and Caleb."

Screenwriting,39pqc1,JimSFV,4,Sat Jun 13 17:02:02 2015 UTC,"That was the whole test. It wasn't ""can she trick you into thinking she's human"" it was ""can she trick you into thinking she likes you enough to use you to escape."" Issac knew she would use him to escape but he didn't think Caleb would be able to outsmart him."
Screenwriting,39pqc1,Dofleini,2,Sat Jun 13 17:23:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to spoiler, so just don't read this stuff for those that haven't seen it.         Maybe that's the point. The audience, like Caleb, wants to believe in this cutesy little romance they have going. We want to believe this cute, innocent girl has a crush on us so much, that we forget that her priority is not being killed.          Caleb is a risk. He's easily susceptible to love, and you know how jealous guys get. Who knows what he'd expose about her in the real world. Her only examples of humans are Nathan, who's a monster, and Caleb, who is deceitful and manipulable. I wouldn't trust them either."
Screenwriting,39pqc1,Dofleini,2,Sat Jun 13 16:58:11 2015 UTC,"But what about the helicopter?  At the end, when Ava escapes away, why does the helicopter pilot pick her up without question?  Wasn't he coming there to pick up Caleb?  Wouldn't he be confused as to Caleb's absense?  Should we assume Ava just said:    Oh, you know that Caleb guy you were scheduled to pick up today?  He decided to stay another week.  Can I get a ride to downtown Manhattan?   I think the helicopter pilot would have called Oscar Isaac's character and asked what was up.  When he got no response and no confirmation whatsoever about Caleb's whereabouts, since Oscar Isaac was dead and unable to respond to radio/phone calls and Caleb was trapped in a room alone, he would have checked in on them inside the compound."
Screenwriting,39pqc1,adesimo1,3,Sat Jun 13 20:11:18 2015 UTC,I think part of the pilot's job is to not ask questions. Could've even been a different pilot.

The point is that if she's smart enough to escape Nathan's fortress, she's smart enough to come up with an excuse as to why Caleb isn't there for his ride. Plus, the pilot would have no idea about what they were doing there, so he wouldn't have any reasons to second guess anything."

A lot of scripts they choose do tend to be stuck in a standard level of developmental hell. So it could be years before anything comes from the optioned script.   It's painless though. You upload the script and wait for a email 45 days later to say yes or no.

The overwhelming majority of the time, rejection in Hollywood takes the form of the phone not ringing, an email not arriving in your inbox.   The people who might buy your script are in the business of making movies, not in the business of providing feedback or supportive pats on the back to amateurs. Furthermore, a non-trivial percentage of amateurs treat any sort of rejection response as either an excuse to argue or an excuse to insult the person rejecting them. Producers and development execs, therefore, quickly learn that it is simply not worth it for them to bother to try."

I read on a blog that they encourage you to make the script public (even if you have opted for private viewing) and then the 45 day free option window starts. The public can make changes or suggest things and they keep the rights forever. I don't mind about that, but I am worried that that would mean they would use those revisions and make something based on my screenplay (if it ever gets to that stage). From your post though, it sounds like a very straight forward and harmless service. Might be worth trying."

Execution is everything.  If you have a script with an idea in it but it's executed poorly, then that script is worthless.  The idea could be stolen, but far more likely someone else also came up with the idea on their own.  If you've got a ""slice of life"" script with no big ideas in it but it's executed well -- congrats, you likely just sold a script, or at the very least got a job.  Execution is everything.  If you submit a script which demonstrates that you are an excellent writer ready to take the next step, Amazon (and everyone else) will fall all over themselves trying to throw money at you.

Screenwriting,39n262,ChupaGoblin,8,Fri Jun 12 22:24:25 2015 UTC,"Tough love time.   There's a typo in the first line on page one. Typos happen, but you've gotta catch that.   Does anybody on the planet spell their name Howerd?   The first scene is, well ... I mean, it's pretty dull. They're really talking about nothing. And, well, let's be honest, that's been done. It has zero stakes. The best laugh in the first scene is something that won't show up on the screen (""he must really like the band ..."").   Either I find your banter incredibly witty, or I find this scene as dead as doornails. I didn't find your banter incredibly witty. I was bored long before page 4.   I mostly kept going on from that point to see if anything would actually happen. And for a moment it very briefly becomes about asking Roxy out, but that doesn't really amount to much, it's an afterthought in this scene.   The thing about Seinfeld is that those conversations about nothing were usually related to a psychological or observations truth. That is to say, one of two things was going on:   There was an interesting observation about the world, that made the audience say, ""huh, yeah, that's true"" which was then spun by a series of logical steps to an absurd conclusion.   Or there was a fundamental psychological truth we could connect to on display, being blown up an exaggerated for comedic purposes but we could still emotionally connect because we had felt, at some point, that kernel of truth.   So basically, they're talking about this random stuff ... WHILE ROXY IS RIGHT THERE. And the thing is, they wouldn't do that. It's not true. If you want to write a scene about how oblivious they are to how what they are saying is turning her off, you could do that ... but you haven't written that scene.   They do nothing attractive here, and yet she gives them her phone number? Why? I think it's because you require that for your plot to work - but it's a lie. If you want them to get her phone number they have to earn it in some way. Especially because ""Asking her out"" is the closest this scene has to any sort of dramatic energy.   But basically they act in a way that is completely inconsistent with trying to get her number, that would never succeed in getting her number, and yet they get it any way. Now, yes, in a comedy you can have absurd outcomes, but they have to be logically absurd - that is to say, they have to flow logically from the absurd behavior of the character working in a surprising but consistent way.   The other thing is that I honestly have almost no idea who these characters are at the end of this scene. They've spent most of it talking about nothing. I'm a third of the way through your pilot. Character is revealed, fundamentally, by choices under pressure. No pressure + no choices = no character.  You could get there, in this scene, and sometimes you're not too far. For example, okay, they could lie about being in a band to get her number! Great! That's a choice. If she's about to walk away, and has maybe just made it clear that she doesn't care that he's smart, that's some pressure.   But you have to bring us into that. e.g., if we know that they're NOT in a band already, and she's turned down his offer to go to a museum or something, and she says something along the lines of:  ""I love music.""  and he responds with:  ""I'm in a band, we're playing tonight, you should come!""  That's a choice under pressure. It tells me something about him. It's an attempt to get what he wants (a date with her) so it is connected to some sort of dramatic urgency.   But you haven't shaped this scene like that.   Comedy requires dramatic urgency. Something has to be at stake. There has to be a driving want. Two guys having a random conversation about something can get you into a scene, but you can't carry it.   Take a look at the first scene of Seinfeld.   https://vimeo.com/82691805  After the stand-up intro, we come into a conversation about nothing - the button on the shirt. But it is based on an observational truth, although they don't do very much with it. (I mean, yes, we've all worn shirts where that button just felt like it was in the wrong place, so there's something there, just very little).   It lasts under 30 seconds.   Then they get into the coffee thing. And bam, we already have a dramatic want: George wants to be sure he doesn't get caffeinated coffee. This is not a huge dramatic want, but notice how the next 25 (!) seconds of the scene are all built around his desire to have decaf, they get a few laughs out of it.  AND THEY MOVE ON.  Okay, we're less than a minute into the scene, here, and now they're getting into the plot of the episode, with Jerry explaining about how he met this woman, and we're off.   Second scene, we get 30 seconds of nothing (George talking about how bored he is, an observational joke about another dude at the laundry-mat) and then, bam, 30 seconds in, we're back in it. We're back on the plot of the episode: figuring out what is up with this woman.   I'd encourage you to do this with more episodes of your favorite shows, dig in. The conversation about the coffee is really a good example - yes, it's sort of about nothing, but it's still a solid 30-second bit with a dramatic question and multiple distinct laughs. It's not just trying to be vaguely witty. There is a huge difference."
Screenwriting,39n262,HotspurJr,2,Sat Jun 13 07:54:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely appreciate the tough love. I obviously need it.  No one I know spells their name Howerd, but I just thought it'd be funny. I had jokes in mind to acknowledge and explain his goofy name, but maybe I should have put them in the pilot.  I'll work on the first screen. I was hoping their jokes would hold the attention, but most jokes are just said and they don't really acknowledge their presence. Like you said you didn't find it extremely witty, so I guess it may not work.   There's a lot of good stuff in your comment. I appreciate it."
Screenwriting,39n262,HotspurJr,3,Sat Jun 13 16:42:27 2015 UTC,"The thing with the Howerd joke is that it's invisible. The audience won't know it. They'll assume it's Howard. While I'm in favor of putting in the occasional extra joke for the reader, you've got to be careful if you're doing too much of that and the jokes in the script aren't landing.  Also, it's important to understand that comedy does not equal jokes. Jokes are a part of comedy, but actually a surprisingly small part. Actually saying ""funny things"" is a relatively small part of comedy. Packing this full of more jokes is not the solution here. It's not a mistake, but it's not the solution.   I'd strongly encourage you to read ""The Hidden Tools of Comedy"" by Kaplan. I think it might really help you.   And you have some good ideas for jokes here. e.g., ""My brother's name is Billabong."" I think that joke could kill - if it was in a context where it wasn't just a random funny thing thrown in, if it was connected to character and situation. You want to build your comedic situations first ... and then add in the jokes."

It would be especially valuable for fans since his is meant to be the definitive version of the ""Saucermen from Mars"" conceit.  Lucas had to start off with Jeb Stuart (one of his drafts has long been available) because Boam wasn't initially available.  When Lucas had a version of the ""Saucerman"" concept he was happy with (presumably Boam's), Spielberg nuked the project because Independence Day came out and declared itself the definitive alien invasion film.  Lucas moved on with the Star Wars prequels before figuring out a way to combine his saucerman concept with a ""Chariots of the Gods"" angle by grounding it with crystal skulls.  Then they hired Frank Darabont who wrote a few drafts - his insane and hugely entertaining version is also available.  Lucas rejected that one for reasons unknown, wrote his own revision of it, then Jeff Nathanson was brought on board.  None of his drafts are available.  Finally, David Koepp delivered the unfortunate final version that satisfied that Beards, but none of us.  Any of the many rejected Indy4 scripts not currently found would be fascinating to read."

Screenwriting,39lp44,IAmLuckyDuckling,17,Fri Jun 12 16:43:35 2015 UTC,"A few things here. John August and Craig Mazin are both top of the line, A-list screenwriters. The fact that they even have movies made (by the biggest production companies) means that they are in the top .01 percent of screenwriters. We understand that of the five or six big production companies, each maybe makes fifteen movies per year? It's so incredibly difficult to get a movie made that I don't think I could accurately give some sort of comparison that would do it justice.   Fuck this talk about ""those who can't do, teach"". They work at the top of their field. Most working screenwriters would be lucky to get their name misspelled in the credits of a fucking Lifetime movie that your grandma watches at 2 in the afternoon on a Tuesday because she accidentally switched from The View. You can work as a writer and literally get nothing produced. And that's cool because that means they're aren't 40 or 50 living screenwriters controlling the entire industry. There's room for you too! I bet you can't even name 30 movies that came out this year. That is a really, really, really, small group of individuals who were able to get their work produced to actually cross your threshold of ""quality.""  But lets allow ourselves to discount all of that and just go off of the ""are their movies good or bad"" criteria. Craig Mazin writes comedies. Comedies exist in a state of critical flux. However reliable film criticism actually is, I would say that you're equally likely to become autistic from a vaccine than you are to read a reliable comedy criticism. Do you think ""Anchorman"" is a good movie? Head on over to Rotten Tomatoes to see if you're right!   Are you back? Crazy right? That low? For such a funny, original movie? Insanity. I'll stop being a dick and move on.  Nobody can tell you if a movie is good or bad, funny or not funny, but if we're going to assign these two writers titles, then I would say they're two of the most talented, sought after writers currently in the business. It would be a gross miscalculation to see a smushed tomato next to their name and conclude that they're not in a very very small, elite group of screenwriters because of it.  Tons and tons of people go to see Mr. Mazin's movies. Now a huge audience doesn't necessarily make a movie ""good"" but it's gotta mean something right? It means that the audience is having a good time, for whatever reason, for whatever form of attraction, they are having a good time. And if we're going to look at how much money Mr. Mazin's movies have made, I'm going to go ahead and suggest that people have a GREAT time at his movies. In the history of PRODUCED film, very few writers are attached to as much success as he has been.   Forced segue time, lets talk about John August.   Big Fish.  This is a classic case of a new screenwriters disillusionment with the film business and the process of how movies are made. And I'm really glad you asked this question in earnest, because it's something that many people don't seem to understand at all. I'm still a part of that group.   I couldn't think of two more qualified people to give me FREE advice about both the craft and business side of moviemaking. Both of which they are beyond qualified for. Doesn't hurt that they're also entertaining.   There's no disparity, you just need to reorganize your perception of ""success"" and ""quality"" in the film business."

Screenwriting,39lp44,tpounds0,4,Fri Jun 12 18:29:30 2015 UTC,Exactly. You aren't working for 15+ years in the business unless people trust you to do good work.
Screenwriting,39lp44,thehollowman84,3,Fri Jun 12 18:32:15 2015 UTC,"Bingo. If you create a ""good"" movie, which is to say a movie that is critical acclaimed, loved by audiences, and also makes a lot of money you are likely one of the most talented people to have ever existed.  You need to understand that someone like say, Quentin Tarantino, is one of the most exceptional creative people to exist. Not just in our time, but ever, in the history of humanity.   It's also not random that so many great writers are also great directors. There is more to making a great movie than just writing a great script."
Screenwriting,39lp44,tpounds0,6,Fri Jun 12 18:58:03 2015 UTC,"Screenplays just get shredded during production. And directors/studios/actors regularly completely rewrite a script between signing on and production begins.

Screenwriting,39lp44,Piqsirpoq,4,Fri Jun 12 18:25:10 2015 UTC,"Most professional screenwriting is commissioned work. In other words, someone has an idea and gives you the job of writing a script or salvaging a pre-existing script (i.e. polishing a turd). Your job is then to cater for that vision and follow the notes from the studio, the lead actor, the director etc. to the best of your ability. The end result is out of your hands. Film-making is a collaborative process. Read William Goldman, Michael Piller and Lennon & Garant for how things can go wrong (and right).   Professional screenwriters also write a lot of scripts that never get produced. More often than not, these are scripts that originate from the screenwriters themselves. They get sold, but not made. They give the writer some notice and then he/she is given an existing IP to work on."
Screenwriting,39lp44,BobFinger,2,Fri Jun 12 18:29:22 2015 UTC,"They are great screenwriters. And I mean great screenwriters.   Just find yourselves one of their scripts -- John makes his available but Craig's may be harder to find; I've had the opportunity to read both -- and read how it's done. Literally: read and learn. See how well each scene is set up, right from the first page, moving you forward, giving you the information and character you need without slathering it around amateurishly, transitioning seamlessly into the next. If you're not careful you'll read right to the end before you remember to put it down.  Now compare that to pretty much every other screenplay you can get your hands on. Most of them -- even produced ones, even produced ones for films that turned out really well -- are nowhere near that good. (A Coen brothers or Tarantino script excepted, obviously, along with a few others.)  I think you have to keep in mind that movies are made to be a particular kind of product. They're part of the studio programming for a particular slate. They're not all supposed to be There Will Be Blood. They can't all be There Will Be Blood.  Hey, I didn't love Scary Movie 3 all that much. Not really my thing. But to think that my lack of love for it (or critical love for it) somehow reflects on Craig's overall talent as a writer is...erroneous. And it reveals a lack of understanding that a lot of wannabe screenwriters have about just how specific/limited a role the screenplay plays in the overall creation of a movie.  Plus just listen to them talk about story, or character, or scene structure. If you think they're just talking out their asses, I guess that's your call and your loss. But they do know."
Screenwriting,39lp44,HotspurJr,3,Fri Jun 12 18:58:53 2015 UTC,"There's a point of standing among professional screenwriters, which you'll come across often:  Don't judge the quality of the screenwriter by the finished movie.  I admit that we can be, sometimes, somewhat two-faced about this, since nobody minds if somebody credit the screenwriter based on the quality of the movie.   But it's an important point. ""Chinatown"" is often held up as a paragon of screenwriting structure, but that structure was largely built in the editing room, where massive work was done.   Writers suffer less if a movie is a bomb (and benefit less if it is a hit) because everybody in the industry understands that the screenwriter is only one part in determining if the movie is any good, and often the screenwriter is implementing ideas other people involved are demanding. e.g. Terry Rossio once mentioned that the addition of Keith Richards as Jack Sparrow's dad was presented to him as something already decided upon, and it was his job simply to make it work as well as possible.   Every working writer I know respects the hell out of August and Maizin, for reasons that pre-date the podcast. Whether or not you like their movies, nobody would claim those are guys who don't consistently deliver professional work.   The other thing is that of the movies you listed, at least six of them are considered major successes. Even if you don't love them (which is fine, taste is subjective) the people involved were clearly happy with the result."
Screenwriting,39lp44,k8powers,5,Fri Jun 12 19:31:57 2015 UTC,"This question actually touches on a skill set that writers need to develop as they improve: Evaluating the value of feedback or ""how do I know this person is worth listening to?""   In life, we often use authority or markers of status as a shorthand for ""yes, this person is worth listening to."" Teachers, parents, famous people all generally benefit from this instinct. But this is not a foolproof system.  For one thing, some of us are hardwired to mistrust authority and our first instinct when someone says they're in charge is to say ""why you and not me?""   For another, we all start out more or less clueless about what actual skill or wisdom looks like, so we're not the best judges of whether someone is respected for their ability or for other reasons. I went to USC film school, and some of my best professors were the least successful ""on paper"" and some legends who were deservedly renowned for their writing but a dreadful fit for the kind of stuff I was writing. Scriptshadow talks with great authority about becoming a producer, but I've worked with a small group of balls-out amazing producers and I can tell from the way he phrases things that he is an utter innocent. Yet others still consider him an insightful source of information.  So it's useful to develop some back ups methods for deciding whether someone has value as a source of notes, advice, etc. Here's what I use:   What happens to my work when/if I apply their notes? Does it get stronger, do I understand my characters more clearly, does my story make more sense? Does it give me new ideas that I love? Or does it make me panic and feel overwhelmed? This is far and away the better metric, but the problem is it's very hard to apply when you're just starting out because there's so much you don't know, panic and overwhelm are more or less the baseline experience.  Do other people seem to benefit from this person's notes/advice, etc? This was a snap to apply in film school, because I'd see my classmates getting notes and I'd think ""Okay, that's exactly what needed to be said. This person is smart as hell.""  This is also where the scriptnotes' podcasters IMDB pages aren't much help, because in truth, they've probably worked on -- conservatively -- another 10 or 20 projects that didn't get made and therefore aren't listed. That's not a bad thing. That's evidence that even when a project doesn't get made, the studios and executives still feel positive enough about their work to go back and hire them again and again. We also don't know about the times they were hired to move a project along and yet don't have their name on the finished script for various reasons.    So if IMDB isn't a reliable source of data to answer #2, where can you find some evidence that their advice has helped others? As it turns out, you can do the same thing I did in film school: Read the Three Page Challenges ahead of each episode, then listen to their notes. Do you feel like they're giving useful feedback? Do you see how their notes would make each sample stronger?   I agree, it would be lovely if there were some automated ""Yep, This Person is Legit"" bot that went through the world stamping the appropriate people so you'd know whether to trust them. But there isn't, so in the meantime you'll have to draw your own conclusions. Which, handily enough, is a skill set you'll need with your own work as you develop as a writer."
Screenwriting,39lp44,MarcusHalberstram88,3,Fri Jun 12 17:44:06 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the movies you listed weren't written on spec.  They almost certainly weren't based solely on ideas John or Craig conceived and executed alone; they were likely writing assignments given to them.  Craig told a story a few weeks ago about when he was first starting out, he and his writing partner had an opportunity to pitch a bunch of ideas to a studio who was looking to make a Marlon Waynes Wayans movie (who was big at the time).  They pitched them a bunch of ideas, but the one they liked was kind of a throwaway idea: a screwball comedy about a guy who discovers a drug that heightens his senses.  The result was Senseless, starring Marlon Waynes Wayans and David Spade.  And it's about as good as you would expect a cheesy, late-90s comedy starring Marlon Waynes Wayans and David Spade to be.  But that's just what they were hired to write.  They were working within the confines of what the people who sign the checks wanted.  And one thing I've learned from the podcast is that's what successful screenwriters do.  Just because they have shitty movies on their resume doesn't make them less successful screenwriters; the fact that they have a produced resume at all makes them successful screenwriters.  That's ""making it."""

Screenwriting,39lp44,MmmWafffles,-7,Fri Jun 12 19:59:24 2015 UTC,"I don't really know their careers but it could easily be a case of ""those who can't do, teach"".  If you're brilliant at math or chemistry, you'll probably make big money in some corporation.  Physics geniuses probably make their way toward NASA or SpaceX.  English prodigies will probably end up writing novels.  Those who aren't the best of the best, though, have to go through the giant pinball machine of life like everyone else.  They've still been educated and have experience in math or chemistry or English or physics, but they're more or less average.  Some average screenwriters will take their education and go teach at universities, some will write low-budget SciFi movies, some will make podcasts.  They're still knowledgable and talented, it's just that they're more talented (judging from the popularity of the Scriptnotes) at communicating with the rest of the world about screenwriting.  It's also interesting to note that Robert McKee teaches one of the most popular seminars on screenwriting, and his book ""Story"" is one of the top 5 screenwriting books, but he famously has never had a major screenplay produced.  Does that mean he's bad at screenwriting?  It's certainly not a good sign.  Does that mean he isn't knowledgeable?  Nope, not at all.  His information is still valuable, and if his 'purpose' is to help get more promising screenwriters off the ground to write better stories than he ever could, that's fine.  I don't mean to make him sound like a saint - I'm very skeptical of seminars and the guy sure makes plenty of money ""helping"" young screenwriters - but the fact remains he makes good points in his theory of screenwriting.  So the point is their knowledge, understanding, and assessment of screenwriting is very good, and their communication with people relatively inexperienced in the craft is exceptional while remaining relevant to more experienced listeners.  Their screenwriting careers may not be mind-blowing (though again I'm not familiar with their work), but regardless there's still a whole lot of value in listening to what they have to say."

I have a question related to this post. I'm trying to fully wrap my head around the relationship between ""dramatic need"" and ""goal"", specifically in regards to changing them throughout the script. For example: does Neo's goal and/or dramatic need switch from visiting the oracle, to rescuing Morpheus, to defeating Smith? Or does his goal/dramatic need stay the same (maybe, to answer the question ""What is the Matrix?"")? Or neither? Both? All of the above? Is art something that's beyond human understanding? What is the nature of the universe?  A follow-up question: are there some good examples that spring to mind of movies in which the goal or dramatic need switches some time after the first act break, even multiple times?"
Screenwriting,39lm6a,The-Lord-Our-God,3,Fri Jun 12 19:23:42 2015 UTC,"I have a question related to this post. I'm trying to fully wrap my head around the relationship between ""dramatic need"" and ""goal"",   You and me both. Here's a very reductive guideline:  Imagine writing an I Want Song for Thomas Anderson before the Matrix. What would that look like? Probably some version of, ""All my life I have dreamed of something better than here/why do I feel like I'm trapped in a box."" His abstract goal is freedom, knowledge, truth, self actualization.  The first act crystalizes all that into a story specific goal. It starts with finding out what the matrix is, learning how to move in it, saving Morpheus, beating Smith. The day to day concrete goal changes, but it plays under the umbrella of the angst/need/flaws that would be inherent in the I want song if he had one.   Is art something that's beyond human understanding?   Yes. Every dumb word out of my mouth is a desperate, doomed attempt to simplify an extraordinarily complex body of work. Some will benefit from it, some won't.   What is the nature of the universe?   Fuck if I know.   A follow-up question: are there some good examples that spring to mind of movies in which the goal or dramatic need switches some time after the first act break, even multiple times?   Any movie where the hero has a goal, loses his friends in pursuit of it, and must get his friends back (Wall Street, Can't Buy Me Love, Teen Wolf). Rooting interests in these are simple. They tend to reaffirm cultural norms.  Any movie where the hero's deal is more complicated and he goes after several false goal before stumbling into the true goal (Chinatown, Michael Clayton) - determining rooting interests on these is a bitch. They tend to reaffirm a more cynical world view.  Stories about machievellian plotting: Miller's Crossing, Yojimbo, Brick.   These are all arguable, especially brick, but I offer them up as conversational fodder."
Screenwriting,39lm6a,beneverhart,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:04:16 2015 UTC,"My way of getting my head around this issue is to get at this from the intersection of stakes and the protagonist.   Ideally, if you want your script to be dramatic, the script tells the story of the hardest thing your protagonist has ever done. Or definitely one of the hardest things. (And if it isn't, then I would ask the writer if the hardest thing that guy or gal ever did is a more interesting story.) So then you start unpacking why it's so hard.   If the love interest is being held at the top of a tall building but your protagonist is afraid of heights, then the overall goal is saving that love interest but the smaller goal is conquering that fear, step by step. Or foot-hold by foot-hld. Or whatever. This is a very rudimentary/reductive example.   For Neo, one of the hardest things he's ever done is realizing his power as ""The One"", which is impossible to do as a mundane corporate worker in a cubicle farm. Only when he takes the red pill does he begin his journey from office slave to savior. I would argue that the sequels don't have such a stark contrast between Neo at the beginning and Neo at the end, even though I still enjoy those two movies a lot more than the general public."

I don't know, according to a lot of people here, you're a champion of the so-called ""acts"", which are only for hacks and sellouts, so it must not be that complex. So, you know, go fuck yourself (it's hard for me to tell when my humor is coming across as humor. Did I sound like a genuine asshole just now? I was also joking with the ""art"" and ""universe"" questions, but now I'm not sure if that was obvious either; I just don't know anymore.).  Anyway, thanks for the response- that makes sense. If the goal changes, it should only change to some other concrete, visual example of achieving/fixing the overarching abstract goal/flaw from act 1. Something like that? Also, thanks for those examples- I've only seen Chinatown and Yojimbo from that list, so I'll have to check out the others.  If I can continue wasting your time, can I hit you with a hypothetical question in the same vein? Take an alien invasion movie (or a real, human invasion- I guess I just like sci-fi); maybe act one ends with the aliens invading and zapping people to bits. Would it make sense that the main character's main goal is to stay alive, with changing goals being things like hiding in a shack until the human-sniffing robot is gone, getting across the river, getting to the bunker, etc.? Or do stories like that generally have a more abstract goal stated even before the aliens invade, such as learning to take charge, which surfaces while hiding in a shack, crossing the river, yadda yadda? Was that WAY too general of a question to even answer? I know that a story can be told in countless ways, I guess my question was more along the lines of: Since the whole idea of codifying acts and beats and goals and stakes is to describe how and why some stories emotionally resonate with people, is there a better route between the two goals in my hypothetical example?"

Screenwriting,39lm6a,The-Lord-Our-God,2,Fri Jun 12 21:59:12 2015 UTC,"I find some of the best scripts often have this switch in goals. I like to construct my Second Act with this built in, actually. In the transition from Act One to the beginning of Act Two, the protagonist commits to a course of action in response to whatever has just happened. In Act One of Die Hard, terrorists have just stormed Nakatomi Plaza and John McClain gets away. Does he decide then and there to launch an frontal assault against them? No. He lays in wait, hides and tries to reach the police. Al the cop doesn't actually show up until midpoint. It's only when the gambit to reach the police doesn't solve the problem that he goes on the full offensive. Another example: Luke doesn't leave Tattoine to rescue Princess Leia, his goal is just to go to Alderaan to learn about the force and become a Jedi. It's only when he gets to the middle of the movie and is pulled into the Death Star that he changes course.   I break the story this way: Act One is the ""ordinary world"" and some antagonistic force changes that for the protagonist. Act Two (Part One) is the protagonist setting out on a course of action that is well-intentioned but ultimately either wrong or ineffective. Mid-Point is the consequence of that realization. Act Two (Part Two) is the protagonist changing his strategy, going more on the offensive -- which sets the stage for Act Three when there's a martyr moment, when a core piece of the character changes fully and permanently."

In Star Wars, it's when Uncle Owen tells Luke to forget about Princess Leia's message and have R2's memory wiped. It's been a little bit since I watched ""Die Hard"" but I think the ""refusal"" moment there is when he has the argument with Holly about using her maiden name. (John's overall goal doesn't have anything to do with defeating terrorists -- it's reconnecting with his wife. Hans Gruber just happens to be in the way of that goal.) The so-called ""Refusal of the Call"" in Act One is important because it's showing the audience how difficult the upcoming struggle in Act Two is going to be because a) the hero doesn't want to do it at first or b) someone with power over him/her won't let them."

If your cancer patient is positive all the way, I'm not gonna like her, because I don't believe her-- and not coincidentally, I think this is also the key to giving her more depth as a character. You always need to search for the paradox within your protagonist, that will make her infinitely more interesting.   For instance: maybe she's positive, but also a strong believer in right-wing-political ideologies: she thinks everyone down and out (your bums, drug addicts, dirt poor people) only have themselves to blame. All her life, she has been able to keep that point of view, because everything did go her way, reinforcing her belief that confidence, optimism and tenacity is what you need to succeed in life.  Then, she gets cancer. And her husband leaves her, because he can't handle it. She loses everything, and no one is there to help her, because all her friends are not interested in people with serious problems. Now, we have a nice dilemma for her: or she keeps her viewpoint on life which might very well cost her her life, OR she starts to change and starts asking for help-- starts asking a friend for a loan to pay the medical bills.  I'm not sure this is the right solution for your character (I just riffed a bit) but what something like this immediately adds is a paradoxal quality in the character, pulling her out of being a black-and-white (=bland) person, making her more interesting and relatable, and adding a psychological development, a psychological change she needs to undergo for her to fulfill her journey.  EDIT because you don't seem to have that in your story: she's positive, she stays positive, and that will save her. Boring. No change, no conflict."

Screenwriting,39kh1e,theWallflower,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:41:42 2015 UTC,"Guilt.  A trial by fire (or cancer, in this case).  For example, one may believe God(s) or karma or the Law conspires to punish the individual for whatever past crimes (no matter how big or little) they committed.  To atone for this, they must embark on a spiritual journey.  Even if the guilt isn't caused by a tangible wrongdoing, being born is simply enough.  In your case, it might help to have someone to talk to.  Confession, in all its forms, is integral to redemption.  Perhaps a family member.  Distant?  Close?  Are they religious/nonreligious?  Positive/negative spirited?  Maybe a doctor who has stared into the faces of many a guilty soul?  I'll tell you, nothing is worse than watching the dying clawing and gnawing on their deathbeds with regret.  Or maybe another patient?  A mirror often makes for good conversation.  Now, it's true.  None of these suggestions are new.  But the story does not need to be new.  Stories of the guilty finding redemption are one of the oldest."

But they aren't bland, they are passionate, compassionate and often have a dark and complex background that led them to a state of what some would call enlightenment.   And they're irritating as shit.   I'm wondering if she has to be the protag?  Is it possible you have a character, another patient, who does find her that irritating. Who hates her positivity?  Who is changed by it? Can you do it with essentially two main characters?  Does being positive mean she has to be dumb and bland?  Can she be insightful and a bit ascerbic?  Can she be aware of how she appears to others?  Can she challenge the other characters not with sticky sweet kindness but with actions of strength and compassion?  Lastly - I find if I like my characters, others do, too. Do you like her?"

It's a built in bias. All we should do is look at the raw numbers and judge who's helping the world more.

Well, by your own words you did buy something form him.  You began as a bit of a skeptic, and after hearing him speak, with no additional objective information, you are a self-proclaimed fan of him and his site. Of course he ""seems"" altruistic. How would it benefit him to seem any other way?  Look at the numbers he, himself has released. They're old, because he seems to have stopped issuing annual reports. At least, I can't find a new one on his site.   Anyway, go look up the number of scripts he says uploaded in the first year. Then add up how much money a single user spent. Minimum two months of hosting and two reads. Minimum.  That's at least $75 per script uploaded. And you know some have been up longer. Multiply the $75 times the number of uploads.  I have no quarrel with anyone having a business and making money.  It's not a non-profit. (Though it easily could be, I suppose, but then he'd have to file 990s and everything would be public.) It's not altruism.   I also have never said people shouldn't use it, that I can recall.  There's a post on my blog that says how I think people should use it to waste as little money as possible and get the biggest advantage.   You want to believe it's ""altruism,"" knock yourself out. But go look at his comment in this thread that really has no purpose but to attack me, once again. This is supposed to be the altruistic CEO of a great new business to help newb writers.  I'm a newb writer. He's got no problem gettin' down and dirty with the middle-school level bullshit, though, does he?   One of the greatest posters we ever had here, 120_pages (you should just go read his account, the posts are a few semesters of film school) was run off these boards when he made some very reasonable observations about how the Black List wasn't that great an investment for the unagented screenwriters it targets.  And the dogs howled. Great guy. Damned shame.  But I won't leave. One thing I know, and so does FL, there are 8 lurkers for every poster. He's not posting for my benefit, nor I for his.

I'm going to take off my coach mask for a second and say something honestly:  I both love and hate the three act structure. I like it as a useful framework to hang ideas on. I hate the flame wars that it invites. Those that really could benefit from it seem almost pathologically averse from it, the people that embrace it tend to embrace it way too hard (if you've ever had a conversation with a Linux user, you know what I'm talking about).  To me, the three act structure is a natural prerequisite to taxonomy, thought experiments, and archetypal assumptions. There is so much shit you can do once you playfully yes-and thre act structure and hack the shit out of it, but it always tends to end up in a mac vs pc flamewar which depresses me.  I'd love to write something like ""hack the cat"", ""building off three act structure,"" or ""three act structure makeovers,"" but I'm not looking forward to six months of threads like this: http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/30jy5j/for_as_much_as_i_talk_about_three_act_structure_i/  Also, specifically which posts?

You want to 1) avoid confusion for the reader and 2) If it were to ever go into production understand that the roles have to be cast and their working days have to be tracked on a schedule, this is usually done based on the name given in the script (the exception being if they appear in a scene but don't speak, that sometimes has to be tracked manually).  For your example GUARD, while numbers do help with the second issue I posted above, they hurt reader understanding. A popular method is to add an adjective like ""SKINNY GUARD"" or ""FAT GUARD"". Also, if you have guards played by different people later in the script, they should not have the same name.  As far as a recurring character, SARGENT is fine, as long as there are no other sargents later on; if so then refer back to my previous paragraph."

My second script got me two Hollywood meetings, one with a major executive producer and the other with a big management/production house. Much better script, but same result. I went on to develop a project with the production house, also not produced.  I had heard the same advice about first scripts being crap and I should have a number of screenplays under my belt, blah, blah, blah, but I decided to get them out there rather than have them sitting in a drawer. It's really your call. If you think they are good enough, submit 'em.

It helps if when you meet with the agent you sound smart and have a lot of ideas and you make it sound like you're not going to be a one-hit wonder.  But, as always ... the reason why most people don't have rep is because their work isn't good enough. One of the frustrating things about boards like this is how often people seem to be eager to put energy into everything EXCEPT improving their script.

Everything I have read says that you actually get noticed by writing for established shows.  Not with the expectation that your script will actually be used in those shows, but that you can follow the format and tone of a currently airing show.  With this in mind, I have personally told myself I should have at least three fully developed teleplays for existing shows (which I have done) and three extra 'pilots' for my own ideas (which I'm currently working on).  Once I finish these six teleplays, I'm going to seek out a manager or someone else who can be a connection to the industry.  Or maybe they'll tell me my stuff stinks and I have to polish them up more.  Either way, that's the arbitrary line I've drawn in the sand for myself."
Screenwriting,39i1e4,ZombineTM,3,Thu Jun 11 21:19:44 2015 UTC,"There's no right or wrong answer to this question. The key is, just make sure it makes sense to the reader.  I've written one large medieval style battle scene, and what I did is focus on the characters and describe what they were doing. I wrote my sluglines like this (don't remember the exact language, so paraphrasing):   EXT. BATTLEFIELD - WITH JACK - CONTINUOUS  EXT. BATTLEFIELD - WITH JILL - CONTINUOUS   So I could hop around from character-to-character to give the battle some pacing and show what the important characters were doing during the battle. Broke it up into more digestible chunks.  I also didn't choreograph every little movement. I tend to believe that less-is-more when it comes to action scenes. I write what's immediately important to understand, but leave most things up to the reader's imagination. A line of action may read:   Borglar advanced, viciously swinging his battleaxe, Jack barely able to parry each crushing blow.   This could be a 2-minute duel, but is easily summed up in one or two lines.  If there's a story-specific thing that happens I'll write it in. For instance:   Borglar whips his horse to action, charging Jack, battleaxe held high. Jill spots her brother in trouble. She looses an arrow, felling the charging horse. Borglar tumbles from back of his fallen steed.   These are really rough, off-the-cuff phrases, but this is how I write a large scene like that. I keep it loose and light. No one wants to read a screenplay with pages and pages of action description."

Screenwriting,39i1e4,drphildobaggins,2,Fri Jun 12 01:33:26 2015 UTC,This makes sense. I'd imagine most of the time the director and fight choreographer have a lot of input on what actually gets shot in the final product.
Screenwriting,39i1e4,LexSenthur,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:01:40 2015 UTC,"Definitely. It probably goes through several iterations between script and screen where things change and constantly evolve. It'll be storyboarded a few times, then there will be a digital animatic, then on-set input from the choreographer and stunt people, then it may change in the cutting room. The director may have a view that's completely different than what you had in mind.  Only write what's absolutely necessary for the reader to make sense of the scene and everyone will thank you.  I remember hearing a little blurb on one of the Futurama DVD commentary tracks where the writers mentioned that they wrote a whole action sequence with the line ""a huge space battle ensues."" That's all the action they needed to get the point across and they left the rest up to the director, board artists and animators."

You could sum that up in a few paragraphs.  But he takes you knee-deep into the guts and gore so that you know the name of every poor schmo who gets in the way of Achilles or Hector or Ajax.  Just look at this shit:   First, Ajax son of Telamon, tower of strength to the Achaeans, broke a phalanx of the Trojans, and came to the assistance of his comrades by killing Acamas son of Eussorus, the best man among the Thracians, being both brave and of great stature. The spear struck the projecting peak of his helmet: its bronze point then went through his forehead into the brain, and darkness veiled his eyes.  Then Diomed killed Axylus son of Teuthranus, a rich man who lived in the strong city of Arisbe, and was beloved by all men; for he had a house by the roadside, and entertained every one who passed; howbeit not one of his guests stood before him to save his life, and Diomed killed both him and his squire Calesius, who was then his charioteer- so the pair passed beneath the earth.   That's vivid as hell and you get the sense that the people dying here are people.  My advice would be to take it from a BATTLE! to a battle. If your hero is in this fight, follow him as he carves a path through the ranks. If your villain is there, show him terrible and mighty and merciless.  Give us some characters to root for or against while this epic battle rages around them.  I don't care about 100,000 CGI enemies being smote from the earth. But I care about Aragorn desperately trying to buy Frodo time, despite being ludicrously outnumbered and personally overpowered by a behemoth troll."

This guy took readers onto the battlefield with some of the most personal, vivid descriptions ever put to print.  Look at this passage and you can see how he took a war where millions died and brought it home for people:   NORMANDY BEACHHEAD, June 16, 1944 – I took a walk along the historic coast of Normandy in the country of France.  It was a lovely day for strolling along the seashore. Men were sleeping on the sand, some of them sleeping forever. Men were floating in the water, but they didn’t know they were in the water, for they were dead.  The water was full of squishy little jellyfish about the size of your hand. Millions of them. In the center each of them had a green design exactly like a four-leaf clover. The good-luck emblem. Sure. Hell yes.  I walked for a mile and a half along the water’s edge of our many-miled invasion beach. You wanted to walk slowly, for the detail on that beach was infinite.  The wreckage was vast and startling. The awful waste and destruction of war, even aside from the loss of human life, has always been one of its outstanding features to those who are in it. Anything and everything is expendable. And we did expend on our beachhead in Normandy during those first few hours.   One man's close-up experience of war is always going to be more powerful than a remote, detached view of war."

We're not talking about a story told in linear fashion with one flashback slapped at beginning, so I would consider this the exception.

There are two possibilities:   What you're trying to write can't happen, and you're trying to hammer your characters into some plot that you've previously decided, and make them act accordingly. The result of this is what we commonly refer to as ""bad writing"". You need to find out/develop/whatever how these characters would behave in this situation. You need to, in equal parts, think about it and experiment with it until you've written something that makes sense for those characters. Or lose it/change it entirely, lest you end up with #1."

Screenwriting,39e0yb,Canaanlives,8,Thu Jun 11 03:00:07 2015 UTC,"With some exception (such as hard sci fi, historical/biographical, etc.) I suggest the following, from my background in journalism: Outline your ""ideal"" story, consider it as all assumptions and then let your outline guide your research. It's okay to be wrong and, if you're not facing a deadline, it's okay to be wrong in your first draft too. Of course research may prove some things false but it'll open up other story possibilities too.  Also, don't be afraid to have an ""expert"" vet your first draft. They may point out the small details like ""oh, this is called the pressure control array, not pressure control panel""... small touches that add that extra bit of authenticity.  Edit:   How can I know my characters if I don't know about where they're from, who they are or what they've been through?   That's you afraid to be wrong, and it's stopping you from putting words down. If you're absolutely clueless, work in broad strokes during your first round of outline. If your script is about a disaster on an oil rig in the middle of the sea you can start with the assumptions and drama that comes from living in isolated close quarters with alpha males. If your story is about a transgendered person and their struggle, you can start the outline by relating to feelings you may have had about being different or lonely or rejected. You can pull universal truths from many premises, start there."
Screenwriting,39e0yb,kissmyrobot,4,Thu Jun 11 03:33:14 2015 UTC,"I always thought ""write what you know"" was referring to emotions, how people talk, mannerisms etc and not to the plot itself.   For example, for Terminator 2 no one would be informed about time travel or paradoxes, nor would they know about robots; but they may know what it's like to grow up without a stable set of parents, they may know about developing trust with people they never used to trust, they may know how a parent and kid would react when they are eventually reunited. This is writing about what you know to me.  All scripts should involve a bit of research to provide an interesting setting or believable details to a scenario though."

I put in ""average height of 8 year old boy."" Got a site with a handy-dandy chart of heights and weights of all ages.   The problem with research is, it's interesting. And it can make us want to include all kinds of stuff that doesn't advance our story. My solution is to make sure I start with a good logline.  I use /u/cynicallad's premise thing. Maybe he'll come leave a link to his article on that.  I don't do outlines, just in the broadest terms. But I try to keep in mind what my story is really about. As long as I have the research stored, I can always go back and check it out.   And it's a first draft.  Get to the end. You'll rewrite.  You'll find stuff to take out, stuff to do more research.   So, go fool people. I mean, that's kinda the point, right? (Hey, I got a great bunch of YT vids on swordfighting if you need it!)"

Screenwriting,39e3py,WriterDuet,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:10:32 2015 UTC,"I just co-hosted a writing-improv hybrid event in LA, and I think it was a wonderful (fun!) way to gain screenwriting skills. The way it worked is we had teams of three for each game (reorganizing teams everytime), each team with all its writers on their computers in a shared WriterDuet (real-time collaborative) screenplay document. (Each team had a separate document.)  Two of the games we played which I thought worked best:  Freeze: in a twist on the acting version (where the freezer takes the position of a freezee), the last line in the previous scene is used as the first line in the next scene. The person who called freeze responds to it in an entirely new context, and goes from there. This is a terrific warmup exercise.  New Choice: two writers construct a scene based on a ""give"" from the moderator, one writer writing at a time. At any point the moderator can say ""change"" and the last writer has to rewrite the last thing they wrote, action or dialogue. This game is extremely valuable for writing, because it challenges writers to both make strong choices, and explore entirely different directions for a scene.  After each game, the groups did a read-through of their short script, which was great.  I'm planning to write up some other improv games I've done as writing exercises (or haven't tried but think would be cool). I'd be happy to share more details if you think it would help your class!"

Screenwriting,39crk3,dpergs4,3,Thu Jun 11 04:14:11 2015 UTC,"They're completely different movies. Jurassic Park 3 took itself way to seriously and ended up falling on its face.  Jurassic World is more of an action-comedy. It's plagued with cliche after cliche, repeated imagery (count how many times the I-Rex's jaw slowly comes into frame), and relied too heavily on VFX. It looked like a video game in some instances.   The first Jurassic Park pretty much shaped our view of dinosaurs today. When you see a T-Rex fossil in a museum, you think of the T-Rex from Jurassic Park. When you hear the word 'raptor,' you visualize the raptors from Jurassic Park -- 'Clever girl.'  I don't want to come off as too harsh a critic, but the believability of the Jurassic Park universe is gone. It's no longer grounded in reality. Which was expected, especially after watching the trailer, but still disappointing.

Screenwriting,39g9q3,simon2it,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:24:21 2015 UTC,"I think your real problem is that 19 pages is a pretty long first act, especially since technically your first proper Act Break doesn't occur until p.24.  Typically first acts that follows Teasers are shorter than later acts, so that the first commercial (assuming teaser leads to opening credits) comes in around the 15 minute mark.  btw, ""five act structure"" actually refers to five full acts. There are shows that just do four acts, but I would guess that six act dramas are actually more common than four act shows now.   Anyway, some drama pilots just start with Act One instead of a Teaser, so instead of a 5-page teaser and a 19-page Act One, you may want to try opening with two ~12 page acts."
Screenwriting,39g9q3,simon2it,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:06:39 2015 UTC,Your act breaks might not be clear enough. It's hard to tell what's going on without having read the script.

Screenwriting,39g9q3,HotspurJr,2,Thu Jun 11 15:13:06 2015 UTC,"But you still need to have a story-centric act break. Your act break doesn't work just because you write ""END ACT 1"". You have to have an actual end to the act, that leads into the next one."
Screenwriting,39g6w0,Proxify,8,Thu Jun 11 14:39:39 2015 UTC,"You don't try to please everyone.  Most of the time (and I'll talk about the exception in a moment) when you ask for feedback, your goal is not to get specific advice on how to make the script better. Your goal is to see how people react to the work.   And then you compare how they reacted to how you wanted them to react, and you figure out what you need to do to fix that.   Most of the time, when somebody says, ""You should have done X instead of Y"" that note is only valuable to the extent that it's saying that Y didn't work.  When people tell you how they reacted to your work, they are never wrong. If I was bored or didn't connect to your characters or thought your lead was a moron, you can't argue with me. That's what I thought.   When people, on the other hand, tell you how to fix something they are almost never right - especially if they're amateurs. What they're really telling you is, ""this is the version of the film I want to make."" Since you're making it, not them, that is not useful information. (Unless they're paying you, but we're going to leave that aside in this post).   It's easy to understand that this is true of your friends, but it's also often true of Black List reviewers, despite the fact that most of those reviewers almost certainly know more about screenwriting than most of the people getting those reviews.   If somebody is acting in a teaching or mentoring capacity, then things are a little different. But a good teacher and mentor asks a lot of questions before they start giving advice. Rather than say, ""You should do X,"" they'll say, ""Oh, if you're trying to do Y, then changing A, B, and C will help you get there.""   You have to become the expert - and this continues all the way through the process. e.g., imagine you're doing a test screening. You don't say, ""The audience didn't laugh at that joke, they're morons!"" You say, ""Hm, the audience didn't laugh at that joke, maybe I can do X to fix it.""  And only bad executives say, ""The audience said they wanted more X, so let's give it to them exactly how they asked for it"" without thinking critically about it.  There might be an occasional time (the ending of ""Pretty in Pink"" is a famous example) when a filmmaker gives the audience what they're asking for because they're not having the emotional reaction he or she wants them to have, but most of the time, you're testing for the reaction, and it's your job to figure out how to give it to them.   When somebody gives you a suggestion, and you're not being paid, the only time you implement it is if your reaction to their suggestion is some variant of, ""Holy crap that's brilliant! Why didn't I think of that?"""

Think of your favourite films of all time, the ones that feels like it's speaking to you personally and you'll find there's another half of the people that saw that and thought it was garbage.    Don't listen to anyones advice because other people will only tell you how to think more like them. The byproduct is a design by committee style of writing. Fuck that.

I made a short a decade+ ago that got picked up by a european TV station, and ran as part of a shorts package, and I think they paid something like $1k a year for two years. (Or maybe they paid half that). Given that the film cost considerably more than $2k to make, I suspect it shared the fate with most short films.  While more people see shorts now than then, fewer people pay for them. It used to be that DVD collections of good shorts weren't too hard to find. Films that played major festivals would get picked up and packaged on a DVD together, and the filmmakers would make a small amount from them. (Almost certainly not covering their budget).   But nobody buys DVDs any more. The shorts are generally available online for free."

There were a rash of short films a few years ago that were corporate sponsored; Spike Jonz and Absolut comes to mind.  But unless you're winning contest money or making money off ad revenue sharing through, say, YouTube then you aren't turning a profit.  Mainstream distribution simply isn't interested and I personally don't think that will change because of the boom of new media and direct to streaming ""television"" shows.

I'd much rather a movie be an hour long and not waste my time by adding fluff that doesn't really move the stories or characters along than be 90+ minutes for the sake of being that long.

Screenwriting,39cpcu,gibbersganfa,2,Thu Jun 11 02:45:48 2015 UTC,"You make a good point and I agree with you. The issue is one of practicality. Given that as of today there are no real outlets for mid-length stories that are not serialized, it is better to focus one's energy on either effective short form that can garner some attention in the festival circuit or go for broke with a feature. I produced a 45 minute film and, even though per academy standards anything over 40 is a feature, we had a really hard time getting it into any worthwhile festivals. Too long to be a short yet too short to be a ""true"" feature."
Screenwriting,39cpcu,Alpha7,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:51:56 2015 UTC,"Generally you'll want shorts to be 10 minutes or less if possible, not because shorts can't be longer but simply because they're easier for festivals to program so you have a better chance of getting in (assuming the quality is there too).  The more films they can program, the more people come to their festival, the more tickets they sell, the more people know about it and talk about it for next year."

Getting an ""investor"" (sponsor or benefactor is the correct term for someone who gives money to a non profit enterprise) is not making money.  The exception is something like a youtube channel, which is essentially a bunch of short films. Quality is low, volume high, thats what clicks over the ad revenue.  Ironically a lot of short film projects fall over about intellectual property rights and who gets what % of the income that will never exist.  Short films are good for one thing, and one thing only if your not a youtube channel. Resumes. The people that benefit most are the actors, then the director(s), Makeup & wardobe, then maybe... maybe script writer... and crew at most gets to network with other crew who also wish they had a real job.  Despite the main actors being the only real beneficiaries of a short film, they will also be the ones on the project that feel most ripped off by the evil producer of it who is obviously keeping all the money for themselves.

I'm just wanting to be able to talk about structure without this constant emphasis on Save the Cat, basically. There are other kinds of stories than linear, hit the mark ones.

Screenwriting,39c1ap,Crapzor,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:04:30 2015 UTC,"can one exist without some sense of stakes?   I guess it depends on how broadly you define stakes.  But if you look at something like Rachel Getting Married, the catalyzing moment is Kym getting out of rehab.  And I guess the stakes are having a good wedding?  Or what are the stakes in Girl Interrupted?  Wanting out of rehab?  That seems odd since she sort of put herself there in the first place.  So the stakes are something really, really nebulous, like becoming sane?  How do we know when she took steps toward that goal?"
Screenwriting,39c1ap,Crapzor,0,Thu Jun 11 01:51:35 2015 UTC,"Good questions both. Here's my attempt at an answer.  Some stories have more internal goals. Both these stories are character driven and juxtapose the character and their flaws against some notion of normalcy. A lot of this works by implication.  I've written about ""wants"" before. In a story like these, the characters flaw or want needs to be as parsable as if they sang an I want song. Then the rest of the first act ought to crystalize exactly how the adventures in the second act shape and influence that want.

I pictured it and the following is what popped out of my head. After some minor consideration and a few google searches later...  This is what I came up with:   Wrath of the Quetzalcoatl or (enter tittle here)  Genre: Dark Action  I pictured a protagonist who is a high ranking lieutenant of a powerful drug cartel in Mexico. An anti-hero. Introduce him overseeing a deal that goes bad, causing the protagonist to shoot some mofos up action style. Stick with him to show his luxurious and lucrative life until...   The cartel use some ancient Aztec ruins to stash their kilos of processed cocaine.   On a routine inspection or supervision of an outgoing shipment the protagonist coincidentally opens up a chamber in the ruins. Inside he sees a golden feathered serpent artifact. Looks like it might be valuable.   The protagonist touches it and thus a vengeful god appears.   The vengeful god says ""You who brings despair to your people will suffer the same fate.""    The vengeful god lowers his staff and shoots a beam at the protagonist. The protagonist screaming in pain and convulsing like he is being electrocuted.    The vengeful god disappears.   Protagonist shaking off the pain notices an animating glowing tattoo on the palm of his hand. Looks like an Aztec symbol but is ticking like a clock keeping time.  Then the protagonist goes about his business while searching for answers.   Fast forward.   A character informs the protag of a legend. The legend of Tezcatlipoca who judged a sinful man by giving him 24 hours to kill a man more sinful then he. The more sinful the kill the more time he was given to live.    ""how does the legend end?""  ""its just a legend...""  protag pistol whips the guy and shows him the tattoo then holds the gun to his temple  ""does this look like a fuckin legend to you?""  ""i dont fucking know. something about the more people he killed the more sinful he became. the harder it was for him to find a man more sinful then he was.""  ""how much time do I have left?""  ""umm it looks like..""  pistol whipped again  ""how much fuckin time?""  ""this looks like an Aztec calendar symbol. If this hand is...seriously would you hold your hand steady...""  protag slaps him with the glowing tattoo hand  ""alright alright 16 hours. give or take""  ""fuck""  protag proceeds to storm out of the building. the archaeologist or history teacher stands.  ""hey wait where are you going?""  Que dupstep or rock music!  Montage of Protag throwing various weapons into the trunk of his car. Protag looks like he is about to go blast some mofos ;)   Start with him taking out the cartel he was indoctrinated in. killing the boss. which gives him more time.  Then it becomes increasingly more challenging for him to find dudes to kill that are more sinful then he is. And he has to do it without getting arrested. When it gets closer to the end of the countdown the protag is giving special powers to help him fend off the cops.  Ending: He turns into the golden artifact identical to the one he found in the ruins. Some little kid picks it up and starts playing with it.   I wonder who else would pick it up? Franchise out that shit. Perhaps it goes to a museum in London? where Jason Statham touches it?    food for thought...."

I have a comedy background but am just now getting into writing.  Questions for you -  What does each character want? And is it specific (enough)? How can the characters behave inappropriately? Either from an emotional perspective, or a want that conflicts with their situation. Do you have enough jokes? A character insulting another character is not a joke. I'm talking setup, punchline. There should be a solid joke every few minutes. How have you differentiated the characters? Their voices seem similar at times. For example, Joey in Friends would never get away saying a Chandler line and visa versa. Because their character voices were so well defined, you'd almost be able to know who was saying what without labeling them in a script.  Other than these questions, I really like your script. It flows really well, held my attention, and I enjoyed the settings and situations."

Screenwriting,39aqiq,_lemme_holla_,5,Wed Jun 10 13:57:37 2015 UTC,"Bad Guy and Good Guy have nothing to do with protagonist and antagonist.   Your protagonist is the main character of your story. It's his or her story. It's the character whose ""want"" we're following, usually.   The antagonist is the force trying to prevent the protagonist from achieving his goal.   The antagonist in gravity is the environment. In Breaking Bad we get Walter White versus Gus Fring, both are bad people, one is a protagonist, and the other is the antagonist.   In your story it sounds like your protagonist is a bad guy, that's perfectly fine. You can make a movie with Hitler as the protagonist and the allied forces as the antagonist."

That's what bugs me about this sub, it's a bunch of dumb shits who worship Blake Snyder.  I apologize for that. I don't mean it, and I feel like I actually felt dumber for writing it.   But here's the point: it's tempting to make that guy ""the bad guy."" You're asking a polite, reasonable question and he's reacting like you shot his dog. The natural urge to demonize him, write him off so you need not think about him ever again.  Writing is the opposite of that normal urge. That hypothetical idiot is the hero of his own life.

But on screen/audio, we have no fucking clue who the chick is until Batman says, ""He has x-ray vision"" and then we are inferring it might be Lois. So the gag on the page and the gag on the screen are not the same effect. You need to let the audience know on screen who the chick is in the same moment you use her name on the screenplay.  Otherwise, your gag won't land on screen. Same problem at the end, on paper it reads SUPERMAN: Lois. But on screen it's black. We have no way of knowing who that is.  Edits for grammar and clarity."

Also as I was driving, my imagination turned to this little rhetorical problem and I realized the solve as another issue: Lois isn't doing anything when the story starts, (no in media res), so maybe she's friggin busy writing a piece, 1/8 page of screenplay where we see a funny headline she's written ""Superman Destroys Alien Habitat"" (or whatever is actually funny haha) and we see her type ""by Lois Lane."" Knock on the door intrudes her moment. I would hate for you to get into editing and not have these two or three easy shots to choose.

Screenwriting,39dj0w,glorfunk,2,Thu Jun 11 16:46:18 2015 UTC,"Ranch-style house:       Ranch (also American ranch, California ranch, rambler or rancher) is a domestic architectural style originating in the United States. The ranch house is noted for its long, close-to-the-ground profile, and minimal use of exterior and interior decoration. The houses fuse modernist ideas and styles with notions of the American Western period working ranches to create a very informal and casual living style.  First built in the 1920s, the ranch style was extremely popular with the booming post-war middle class of the 1940s to 1970s. The style is often associated with tract housing built at this time, particularly in the western United States, which experienced a population explosion during this period, with a corresponding demand for housing. The style was exported to other nations and so is found in other countries. Their popularity waned in the late 20th century as neo-eclectic house styles, a return to using historical and traditional decoration, became popular.  Preservationist movements have begun in some ranch house neighborhoods, as well as renewed interest in the style from a younger generation who did not grow up in ranch-style houses. This renewed interest in the ranch house style has been compared to that which other house styles such as the bungalow and Queen Anne experienced in the 20th century, initial dominance of the market, replacement as the desired housing style, decay and disinterest coupled with many teardowns, then renewed interest and gentrification of the surviving homes.     Image i - Large custom ranch house built in 1966 in California. This house exhibits most of the features of the style, note long low profile and large windows.

If you're interested, check out a podcast called Children of Tendu and start at the beginning.    http://childrenoftendu.libsyn.com/  There are only about 16 of them and they're all interesting and informative.  It's two genre writers that have been working in television for over twenty years.  Their credits include Charmed, The Dead Zone, Lost, Firefly, Grimm, Vampire Diaries, Sleepy Hollow, among others.  So you could certainly make a career out of genre writing.  That being said, it's helpful to have a sample of a more serious drama.  If genre shows aren't hiring, it's better to write for a non-genre show than no show at all."

Screenwriting,39etqr,simon2it,4,Thu Jun 11 18:17:24 2015 UTC,"Joke passes are pretty common in Comedies. They hire about 10-12 comics to go through a script right before production and improve on/ add jokes to the virtually finished script.

They kind of do it in Hollywood, kind of, they do punch-ups where they invite a bunch of comedians and comedy writers who read the script aloud and add jokes. They even do it after they've shot the film, adding jokes in offline dialogue. There's a pretty obvious, and decent, one in MIB3 where J shows up at some random family's house, and there's an o.s joke where a random kids voice asks the mother: ""Why is the president here?""."

The legal issues involved are above my pay grade, and depend on information I don't have. Anything actually written down could be property of both you and Dave. You can't progress without him. Work you did together is more ambiguous, but if anything was going to happen to this one part of your contract would be a declaration that you and Matt were the sole and complete owners of this. If you sign that in bad faith you're liable for all damages, not the company.   If you're really married to this project, you basically have to say to Dave, ""it seems like you're not really that interested in doing this. I want to run with it. What would you want to relinquish any ownership you might have in it?"" Don't make this about Matt. This is just about you and Dave.   Dave will probably ask for something unreasonable (e.g., half of all money you make from it) and if you can't get him to someplace reasonable (say, you pick up the next pizza) then you probably have to let it drop.   Karmically, it feels to me like you know in your heart of hears that Dave has some legitimate claim to this. Not legally, but morally. In that case, all I can say is: don't screw him over. Be better than that. If nothing was ever written down you might be able to get away with it legally (I am not a lawyer, I don't know - it depends on a lot of factors that I don't know) or you might not, and you wouldn't know until it mattered. But karmically and morally, what you can get away with legally is irrelevant. Do the right thing.   You'll have more great ideas. Go develop one of those with Matt."

The answer is: No. Your friend doesn't have legal claim on an idea that has no copyright or valid proof of concept.  That doesn't mean that if he gets angry and passionate enough at you that he won't sue if your idea becomes something more concrete and is successful. If he's able to prove that your work is derivative off of an idea that is 100% his or that you made an agreement with him not to make this without him, you won't have a case.  Otherwise, you're good to make this with ""Matt"" and it may even come out as a different enough story in the process.

Therefore it's pointless to be worried about copyright if you only ever have one idea.   But if you do have multiple ideas then why are you worried about persuing this one in particular? If there is a chance that you could be a great screenwriter and therefore have plenty of ideas/imagination then losing someone as a friend over one idea isn't really worth it when ideas should be a dime a dozen at this point."

Sounds like this happened to you and Dave.

Plus, while reading screenplays is almost a necessity in order to get a handle on form and technique, I honestly think volume is more important than checking off any specific ""greats"". It's far too easy to fetishise specific voices, when what you really want is to develop your own voice and gain confidence in your writing - and seeing what doesn't work, or only sort of works, in other scripts is just as helpful as reading masterpieces, if not more so.

Then once I get a few things down on paper the ideas start to flow and I'm like, this is good. And I keep going for however long. You need to treat it like a job, make a routine, and stay consistent. If you've done that for 30 days straight and you're still ambivalent, then you can relax, you're not a writer and can go find whatever it is you're meant to do.  To answer your question directly, sometimes it is fun. Solving story problems and creating awesome characters, jokes, stunts and worlds is fun, but the rewriting, editing and loose end tying can often be a chore. You're not always going to feel like doing it, so self motivation is an important writer's tool. Because 99 times out of 100, you're alone in your space with a pen or a keyboard.

Sometimes I don't even read what I write and just throw it out knowing I just had to get it out of my system.   Truthfully there is no reason to write. To sit down at a desk for an hour or more and just write is a fucking crazy idea. Even if the most that happens is that you write nonsense that has no form/theme/plot/structure you can look at the ink and know it exists.   This is a long winded comment to basically say that most of the time I never feel like my writing is fun. It's hard work to focus so intensely. It's embarrassing to strip naked onto the page. That's why most of my writing is destroyed by the time I finish writing it, because it's not fun, it's painful but it's painful in the way pulling a stake out of your side is painful."

Screenwriting,3985ho,somelittlebasterd,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:12:30 2015 UTC,"I've always admired people who can tell good stories. I absolutely love to sit down with someone and listen to the things that have happened to them in their lives or the ideas that they ponder over and share. I have always loved stand up comedy for that reason because of the rawness of the writing which comes directly from their own minds. I guess what compels me to write is the hope that I can hone my abilities to the point where I could be regarded on that same level and to truthfully understand. The only way that I can think to do that is by writing down the ideas that I have or to create a narrative for myself (maybe based on my memories/ maybe based on my hopes) through which I can forge my own mind.   I apologize for my response being so long, I just do not have time to shorten it. To summarize, I'd say that I am compelled to write because I feel that our lives are meant to be reflected in our words so if I don't take control of those words they are liable to take control of me."

Screenwriting,3985ho,Interesting_Mistake,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:11:29 2015 UTC,"For the most part when it comes to writing scripts, it's all the same type of writing as anything else. Write what you feel and what comes out naturally then throw on the format of a script. Basically you just gotta set the scene tell us where we are and when and give us the action applied to a character. The dialogue is where the true writing comes to play and where you can really get those thoughts of yours onto the page. Make your character a comedian and give him a set that he's practicing with some buddies. Throw them on a corner cafe with a waiter and a loud group at the table over. You've got personality in the comedian, conflict with the next table over, and a waiter will balance the scene out."

If you can try and write something that is low budget, i.e. Contained. It can be a lot easier to sell/get made. Maybe it doesn't net you a six figure cheque, but it's a step. Really hone in on the genre. I'm finding doors are opening a little bit more for me now that I've written something a little bit more 'producible.'  Or make things happen for yourself.

You either care about this or you don't. If you do, that means you fight through it when you're not feeling it (which happens to everyone!).   On the outlining question, one thing you don't say you do is write a detailed outline. That is to say: list every scene in the script, in the order they occur, and a concise summary of what happens. If you're not doing that, start.   But really, at a certain point, you just have to decide that you want to finish a script more than you don't want to finish a script."

Screenwriting,396s42,In_Parentheses,2,Tue Jun 9 18:03:23 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I'll say it again:  I think outlining is essential. I can't imagine writing a script without it.  But the step up from outline to script is absolutely enormous. You can have a great sense of what it should be in your head from a simple description, but getting it down in compelling script form is what separates those who can from those who can't.  The initial attempts can be so crushingly disappointing as to poison you to the idea altogether. I think with experience comes the notion that 1) the first attempts at going from outline can be sub-par but 2) you might be able to punch through anyway. And the more talented and more experienced you are brings the point 2) ""might"" closer to a ""will"".  My advice would be to make a pact with yourself to grind one to the finish simply as a way of getting experience. It can be so mortifying that it puts the whole screenwriting enterprise to bed forever, but without script #1 there'll never be any script #whatevers.  Writing any fiction is hardhardhard. And can be terrifying. I'm sure there are some for whom it's all automatic typing and epiphanies, but I'm pretty sure it's not the rule. It's one of those things in life that forces you to a hold a mirror up to yourself and find out if you're good enough (for it*), committed enough (for it*) and tough enough(for it*).  *failing at screenwriting does not equal failing at everything. Although in the middle of a script crisis, it'll make you feel like that."

Screenwriting,396s42,svalbard5,2,Wed Jun 10 06:14:59 2015 UTC,"I actually think it would be easier for me to finish an adaptation or do a ""writer for hire"" type script then it would be for me to finish one of my own personal pet projects at this stage.   I haven't tested my theory yet but it would be nice to take the weight off my shoulders and just run with ideas for a change. or experiment with pre conceptualized well known characters rather then creating new ones   But I suppose these are typical growing pains to consider and struggle with as an aspiring screenwriter.   Might as well get it out of the way now when your reputation is not on the line, while you still don't have any deadlines to worry about. Need to discover what kinds of stories we like to tell and why we like to tell them....  So I say ""fuck it"" embrace the meandering. Conjure up all kinds of interesting shit for our future selves to write and play around with when we actually have the free-time, connections, and a network of friends and colleagues supporting challenging and/or competing with us. From the sound of it, having connections and networking is just as important to a screenwriters career as the actual writing bit.    I guess it really depends on why you are writing to begin with.   If you are writing just to write then all that matters is that you keep writing.   If you are writing to finish screenplays for the sake of work ethic all that matters is that you finish screenplays - quality doesn't factor in. and besides when you have finished a screenplay for the sake of finishing it you still have to..wait for it ...wait for it... rewrite it ;)    nevertheless Practice makes perfect. write until your fingers bleed then write some more. but then again ""why the fuck am I writing all of this shit in the first place?  At first I would jump off or dive in with only a grand vision that would naturally fall apart as I rendered it (as cyncallid elegantly put it) I still have much to learn when it comes to storytelling. so those pet projects are stuck in limbo waiting for me to come back to them with a fresh perspective, but more importantly a better understanding of narrative drama in general to pull them off properly.   Now I tend to (if necessary) associate a clear personal and/or storytelling goal to my ""grand visions"".   Like one of the pet projects I have this typical ""grand vision"" such as ""write a story were VR is a like a parallel to drugs"" but then I throw in a list of goals/troupes I want to experiment with like ""create two leads who's stories start off in vastly different worlds but eventually intertwine"" don't know where that came from but it happened. I could go on about how I wanted to present different world views, opinions and POVs to the audience and this and that but....whatever   I would try doing that.   Associate a storytelling goal (or goals) to your grand vision. So if you get to a point where you doubt your vision you always have the personal storytelling goal associated with it to fall back on until you regain your faith in it. Then it becomes more about writing to accomplish that personal goal more so then writing to express some grand vision that seemed epic at the time looking at it from the high abstract but evaporated into dullness when you zoomed in to get a closer look.  But hey at least it got you started....time to put in the work. make the magic happen   Sure If you want to be all ""professional"" about it and finish everything you start and not create a mess searching for that ""needle in a haystack"" story there is nothing wrong with that approach...  I also don't think there is anything wrong with starting and not finishing projects that just don't feel right. its your free time. write however and whatever you want to write. abandon that shit and conjure up something else that grabs your imagination and doesn't let go. assuming there is such a thing. keep conjuring up premises and characters until you find a good mix that almost feels like it writes itself. the scenes pop out of your head faster then you can stream of consciousness write them. the dialog comes natural to you - you dont have to force it out at all. congrats. you have found a story/genre/premise/tone that fits your personal style. write that shit. then rewrite it  or finish everything you start.... work ethic your way through it all. develop a routine that you never comprise and become one of those guys or gals that always shows up to work on time and never does anything out of the ordinary ;)   playing the devils advocate here. throwing out a different POV to consider from the perspective of another aspiring screenwriter.  are you in it to win it? or in it to just be in it? (obviously  rhetorical)    id like to be in it but it be a lie to say im not in it to fucking win it. and by win it i don't mean sell a million dollar spec and get rich. when i say ""win it"" i mean absolutely blow an audiences mind, make them laugh their asses off, keep them on the edge of their seats rooting for or against my characters, and last but certainly not least bring the ""feels"" that makes a grown ass man tear up an cry.   the rest is just a bonus that comes from accomplishing that.  at least that's how i like to look at it"

Guy might have trouble committing to an idea too - because none are ""perfect,"" he'd keep his options open until he dies unpublished.  Get busy living or get busy dying, Guy."
Screenwriting,396s42,WriterDuet,3,Tue Jun 9 20:29:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah... come on, Guy.  I was struck by OP's point as it's something I've struggled with a lot in the past in both writing and other context (jobs, decisions, commitments...). A lot of the time, for me, that 'Peter Panning' impulse is a symptom of a deeper personal trouble I needed to examine. Like, if I'm investing too much of myself in the story/script, aiming so high ('it's going to be a masterpiece, for sure!') that the moment you encounter (inevitable) problems you kinda recoil and push the whole thing away, then repeat the fantasy. It's not necessarily laziness or stupidity that can inspire that kind of perfectionism - rather, you've put too much at stake in it being brilliant, you're asking too much from your work. The Scriptnotes episode 'Psychotherapy For Screenwriters' is great articulating some of this, and how - ironically being unrealistically ambitious with your writing can really kill it.  A couple of things that have helped me:  a) being proactive about showing work to peers I trust, asking for notes etc. I have found myself pushing through the despair (gritting teeth) as it's too embarrassing to then tell those people: actually, that thing you agreed to read? I can't finish it. Second benefit is that you're giving work to receive notes, so you lose that imperative to 'perfect' the work up-front, as you know it's in effect a 'pre-draft' for review, so you might as well do a 'rough preview' before you do your masterpiece.  b) changing my approach to WHERE I START WRITING. You guys have mentioned outlining heavily. One thing I used to do ALL THE TIME is come up with a killer premise and delude myself into thinking the ending worked. I ended up wasting MONTHS (I fear maybe years) on first acts which were great... until you realise that's the complete wrong way around. Nowadays I focus HARD on the middle/ending. This thing I'm doing at the moment, I'm almost writing it Act 3, then 2. Have barely touched Act 1, because I know I wont know what it needs until the ending works. Obviously you need to have in mind an interesting premise from the off - that's a given - but I would suggest you DON'T spend much time on crafting it until you know precisely what your ending needs.  Good luck!"

I don't think you need to state the names of the characters being spoken to as much in the dialogue.  Maybe once if it's for dramatic effect.    I feel like you could even ramp up the conflict in the dialogue a bit more- this is a huge moment for both of them, so no need to dial it back.  Emotions are going to run hot.

I think there is a renewal of interest in the format by the networks, as well as by writers and producers.  They are SO MUCH CHEAPER to produce.  Stylistically, it's a different line to toe as a writer -- ALL THE JOKES HAVE TO HIT in multi-cams...you have laughter (whether live or canned) pointing out each joke.  And if a joke sucks, the laughter will only highlight it's suckiness.  You can get away with more throwaway (in my opinion) in single camera.  I'm excited by the renewed commitment demonstrated this year to the multi-cam -- as an actor, the schedule of one would be a dream, and as a writer, I think the format is so challenging but can also be so incredibly personal to an audience.

Screenwriting,396zy9,jrm2003,2,Tue Jun 9 18:49:29 2015 UTC,"Just read the first 10 pages. I was pretty confused as to what was actually happening in the first few scenes. Peter throws a phone away, we have no idea why. Then he needs a phone. He calls Jess presumably. And Jess bought or rented a restaurant or is selling it. And he gives the keys to teddy, but he's also uninterested in Teddy. And then he shows an apartment to Peter, which at first we assume will be Peter's entirely, but later we learn is just a room for rent in Jeff's house. Then they negotiate a deal but it all seems sort of sneaky, but for seemingly no purpose.... and then there's a voice over...which is the only part that makes any sense to me. Ok he's starting over, he's got plans to remake himself, but then he goes and gets drunk and meets some people, but this never really materializes in a clear scene. So really, after ten pages, I don't really know what's going on."

Did they already have a dialogue?""  ""Oh, okay they're the keys to the restaurant. Got it.""  ""Is Peter an alien? That might be interesting.""  ""Hmm, he says bro. I didn't see him as a bro guy up until this point.""  ""Boom, as soon as the VO starts, it all pieces together.""  ""Drinking is a strange thing to do when cleansing, and that scene really flew by. I guess that could be intentional because it's about drinking.""  ""Oh wait, Jeff is still there? I think I might have been wrong about where this is going.""  ""I'm confused, this seems like a weird cigarette moment.""  ""Man, I'm not sure how I feel about Peter. He's laid back, then motivated, then alcoholic, then likeable, then misogynist.""

Were your script produced, an AD would breakdown your script and plan the shoot around the locations listed in your slugline. ""EXT. SOMEWHERE"" tells us nothing. ""Ext. Jersey City Walkway"" tells us what we need to know. Disregarding problems with physical production, it's just not as clear of a read when the sluglines are vague. The same goes for ""Nearby - Continuous."" If I missed the line saying we're at the walkway I'd have to backtrack to get where the new scene is set. Even knowing we're nearby the walkway still doesn't tell me everything I'd like to know.  Clearly we're far enough away to necessetate a new slugline, so where'd we go?  I'll keep reading, but wanted to mention that up front. Little things like this early on tend to throw me off."

That's late in terms of starting the scene, I think. Because it would've been super boring to start it with Star Lord getting a lift in his car, driving to the hospital, getting out the car... etc. When I write, I picture a timeline of my movie that I scrub through in my minds eye - so each scene starts at the exact moment before the good shit starts happening.

A couple thoughts..... first, kudos for taking your screenwriting educational immersion outside the classroom! This is soooooo something you can delve into on your own --- without paying a nickel. Use your local library for books, if possible. Some of those podcasts are gold --- I'd add Broken Projector podcast to that! And websites? Yes! Free and some fabulous resources!! I'd put GO INTO THE STORY at the top of that list --- so much info for all levels of writers.   When it comes to your class this fall, Lord only knows what you're gonna get, so grain of salt it and don't take it for gospel. Let it be what's it's meant to be -- a way to force yourself into some writing deadlines. Beyond that, if you walk away with a few nuggets, great.  And not to be harsh, but sorry, you lobbed it in here so nicely for us...... dude, you DO sound like a jerk. Just sayin'..... Find yourself a big ol' bottle of humility pills and  swallow some down each and every day. The thing is --- whatever you write early on is gonna be shit too! Absolutely no doubt about it. We've all been there. It might take a bit to see that and own it, but it's true. And once you see that, THEN you can strip away your pride, chuck it to the curb, sift down to the few decent kernels of something within what you write, and write something else. You'll do this over and over and over for quite some time and that's just how it is. If you find you love the process of all that, fantastic! Go with God!   You have some hefty sights set for yourself (write/produce/act???) and hey --- that is awesome!! Think big!!! But start small, be nice to everyone, keep your mind open and learn something new every day. Read scripts, read scripts, read scripts! Soak up the language. You've got a shit-ton to learn and that's okay --- if you immerse in learning, it won't be long before the little things like ""enter late, exit early"" will make all the sense in the world to you.  Good luck!!"

Screenwriting,396jjt,apm588,3,Tue Jun 9 16:47:48 2015 UTC,"I would read up on what makes a good logline. There are plenty of articles out there e.g. http://www.movieoutline.com/articles/writing-good-log-lines.html   For me, what it's missing is a sense of the conflict (other than being a standup comedian is hard) and why the setting is important. Struggling to find your voice is also quite a vague sense of conflict/the goal. Understanding what happens if he succeeds or fails would also help to give a sense of the conflict.   Without these elements it's more of a character study (assuming the character is interesting enough to study) and you'll also find without a goal and a strong antagonist, you'll lose steam in act II.   Just my 2c."

Screenwriting,396jjt,writetheysaid,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:14:22 2015 UTC,"This is a great start, but as /u/writetheysaid noted, it is missing a crucial sense of conflict. An easy fix would be to change 'looks' to 'struggles' but that wouldn't make this a perfect outline. You probably need to add a 'while' and the subplot onto the end of this thing, like 'while military police are hot on his tail' or 'while trying to reconcile with his Orthodox Jewish father'. You can also shorten 'amongst the Borscht Belt resorts of the 1950s' to 'on the Borscht Belt circuit', because the bit about Korean War draft-dodging implies the time period."

Screenwriting,397pj5,omgNSA,2,Tue Jun 9 21:20:41 2015 UTC,"Coherent, from a technical sense it's solid. The story I have issues with for various reasons. The treatment of the emotions feels shallow overall and hints at way too much way too soon. By page 15 I'm fairly certain Doug and Mike have been sleeping together for months.  I think one part that has to do with lack of setup. We don't know the status of Mike and Doug. I would assume they're some level of friends since Mike is dating Doug's sister and they've done so long enough for Ally to say ""I love you"". As is, it's presented kind of as a really shallow ""new teammate crush"".  The twist on page 24 is great on its own, but wasted in the sense that would have made Ally any more or less upset at Mike either way? It doesn't really play a factor in scene starting pg 27. Also, why should this setup exist ?would there be a reason for Ally to feign normality instead of immediately kicking Mike out? Again, wholly under the assumption that her brother is straight.  Not sure why Mike would punch Doug in the mouth. Regardless of Doug saying he's straight, it doesn't affect the fact that Mike is gay and he was losing interest in Ally anyways. Mike doesn't come off internally conflicted enough for this rage to come out, Doug hasn't really screwed him in this situation.  Take a step back, reassess Mike, Ally, and Doug. Each of them are going to have wants and needs and each of them are equally as selfish about those wants and needs. As of right now, the characters are mechanical to a plot.  Ally's smile, what I would consider the moment of redemption for Mike, comes with no set up.  You could get so much more complex with the ""taboo relationship"" setup. As of now it straddles the line between being serious and being a melodramatic parody of the situation... find some of the bitter honesty in these scenes. Give me layers, give me subtext, give me real build up."

I like how you avoid the stereotypical ""coming out"" narrative. It's nuanced and not what I expected.  That said, you could work on Mike a lot. He's not passive, per se, but you could make him more dynamic. What's his family like? What physical characteristics make Mike Mike? Is he always on-edge, looking around to see if anyone will catch him doing something particularly ""homosexual?""   Add these things to give him more depth. You have the fundamentals of story down. Work on your characters and dialogue. Keep practicing."

I mean there were several moments in the story, short as they were, where characters connect with each other and show some tenderness even in the face of such a hardened, unforgiving environment. Maybe it didn't hit the mark for some people but I don't think the movie is %100 spectacle with no character growth or connection.  SPOILERS:  You've got the girls connecting with the old women bikers over the seeds and the satellite passing overhead, the old women seemingly reinvigorated by being able to connect with youth once again. Then you've got Nux connecting with the red-haired girl after realizing he's lost any hope of getting recognition and praise from Immortan.

I also think Hardy was a great Mad Max and his psychosis and his flashbacks really speak to his character and how his one motivation is to survive a harsh and unforgiving world.  I'm pretty biased because this movie instantly became one of my favorite films of all time but I really think you should give it a second viewing and see if you pick up on the character development more."

If anything, stripped of the newness of the spectacle, I found the story even less engaging.  The best (maybe only) realized character is Nux, who is really a supporting role.  For heaven's sake, the film resorts to a clunky scene where Max has to literately ask Furiosa what her motivation is, and she responds, ""Redemption."" Groan.

(""How to we get from this set piece to this set piece"") What attempt at heart (or brains) that is to be found is so cursory, so tacked-on, as to be laughable.  Of course there are notable exceptions. And I'm hopeful that we're nearing the saturation point on perfunctory comic adaptations."
Screenwriting,395evg,joe12south,2,Tue Jun 9 13:50:52 2015 UTC,when you were young did you just write about explosions   Mad Mad isn't just explosions though. There's intricate character development and theme.
Screenwriting,395evg,BradleyX,2,Tue Jun 9 12:01:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to imply it was. The question is meant to stand alone, asking people if what they see as integral to a script has evolved to something deeper over time.  I never said that Mad Max only has explosions, only that I felt it had no heart and that I couldn't emotionally connect to it. That doesn't mean that I think the characters aren't fully developed or that other aspects of it aren't well written."
Screenwriting,395evg,Soul_Engine,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:51:56 2015 UTC,"I'll have to agree with you and the other old timers here (thank God this isn't /r/movies).  Like, for example, take Into Darkness.  Kirk ""dies"" while Spock watches.  Then, 30 seconds later...it gets reversed.  We lose whatever bond or heartfelt sentiment there is supposed to be between these two.  Contrast with the Wrath of Khan...where they actually lose Spock in space because he sacrifices himself.  I don't know anything about Star Trek but this moment is legendary within the franchise/sci-fi in general.  It elevates the characters.  And it sticks with the fans.  And for some reason, I'm reminded of For a Few Dollars More (the more forgotten of the trilogy).  At the end, despite the two bounty hunters being at odds with one another and in a way, getting reduced to simple killers, they genuinely show fondness for one another.  The final duel was so well set-up.  As was the farewell scene.  It shows their humanity amidst the gritty Western landscape.  I can guarantee you Batman and Superman won't be doing this in the upcoming film.  They'll just move from one spot to the next, in video game fashion (this part I emphasize) while spouting mindless dialogue.  And as much as I have my own personal gripes about Guardians of the Galaxy, I can at least see why it's so popular with people.  Because it didn't waste time and space doing useless things.  Every plot point or piece of dialogue had meaning to the characters in it.  So yeah, times have changed.  I'm not so sure I'm a fan.  Imo, the 2010s have been very boring."

I'm old enough to have seen Terminator 2 in theaters and, you're right, it has a ton of heart.  But I think it's because you always remember the good and forget the bad.  Take 1996, for example. A great year for me, I graduated high school. But look at the top-grossing films that year:   Independence Day Twister Mission: Impossible Jerry Maguire Ransom 101 Dalmations The Rock The Nutty Professor The Birdcage A Time to Kill   The top three are some big-budget, special-effects-driven pieces of shit. Even if you won't go that far, you have to acknowledge that there's no heart in perhaps any of those movies other than Jerry Maguire.  1991 looks like an unusually good year (Terminator 2, Beauty and the Beast, Silence of the Lambs, City Slickers, Hook, Addams Family, Father of the Bride...), but 1992 gave us Home Alone 2, Batman Returns, Lethal Weapon 3, The Bodyguard... Certainly not movies with heart.  I think it goes in waves. The early 90s was a good period for filmmaking where a lot of bigger-budget films had some heart. Then, it gets rough. 1998 had Armageddon, The Waterboy and Doctor Doolittle among the top-10 grossing films...  I think you're probably just forgetting all the shit from that era."

Self delusion is the problem, we all suffer from it, sometimes, some might argue that it is a role requirement for screenwriting anyway.  I think what is needed is a very, very good coverage service,  with readers being paid a lot more than minimum wage (and not having to read a dozen scripts a day, or however many) as a starting point for scripts before they are sent to the blacklist.  I don't think the blacklist is broken,  so I don't think it needs fixing, the problem isn't the Blacklist, is it the solution?  I get the vibe from here and elsewhere online(and Mr Leonard) that it is trying to be.  We should applaud it, support it and do all we can to work with it.  It is a simple, genuine route into the system, if your writing is good enough."

The hurdle is that if the writer can't score at least get a 5, they are not allowed (or strongly discouraged) to list their script.  I don't think something has to be fundamentally broken in order to be a candidate for improvement. blcklst.com is good, how it could be better?"

That's the nice thing about the set-up at present, it pays no mind to economic barriers.  There is already a mechanism in place, that /u/franklinleonard has mentioned again and again, scores.  You don't need to refrain from not listing the scores below a 7 for example because those looking for scripts know that delving into scripts that receive low scores is more of a gamble than checking out the higher rated scripts.  Suggesting we need to just not show them at all is to also suggest that these industry professionals are pretty stupid.  Look at it this way, you have scripts rated the following:  4, 8, 6, 5, 3, 8, 5, 6, 4, 9.  If you can't handle picking out the higher ratings from that bunch or can't understand that not picking out the higher ratings is a gamble, then I'm surprised you have the job you have."

(Mr. Leonard has stated that paying $25 to list a script without a review is not advisable.)  And yes, you can weed-out much of the bad writing by requiring two reads. If the script doesn't meet a minimum standard, then it isn't listed. I personally believe that standards benefit everyone, but I certainly understand that many disagree."

And, he posts coverage of specs released by professional WGA writers. The few unagented newbs who qualify are posted right alongside. I have heard that industry ""insiders"" check SS regularly, not for the newbs, but to see what's new in spec scripts from pros. So they are seeing the newbs, also.  Can I guarantee that?

I e-mailed a few blogs during college asking if they needed writers. I tried to stick with sites that paid money and over time my articles got noticed by other editors. From there recommendations helped me land new clients that wanted bigger projects like ebooks.  To get started I'd recommend 2-3 writing samples. Then contact websites that may hire you for writing. Worst case you get a ""No"" or don't get an answer. Very little to lose IMO."

I typically work 7 days a week but only 3-6 hours per day. For bigger projects I'll often work close to full time hours, but I also have small periods without work so I end up with time to focus on my own projects too.  Back in 2008 I entered college without a job and needed a little cash on the side. So I contacted a few blogs asking about writing work. I generally ignored the ones that didn't pay, but luckily found a couple that did pay & were interested.  Back then I was only writing 4-5 articles per month with sporadic copywriting jobs. Now I do closer to 20+ articles a month and have a reliable list of clients who count on my writing, plus new clients who find me online and request my services.  If you want to get started all you need are some work samples & lots of persistence. Contact 10, 20, 50 different websites asking if they're looking for writers.

Another good example, off the top of my head, is the opening of ""In Bruges"":   Ray: ""Bruges is a shithole.""  Ken: ""Bruges is not a shithole.""  Ray: ""Bruges is a shithole.""  Ken: ""Ray, we've only just got off the fucking train, can we reserve judgement on Bruges until we've seen the fucking place?""   If memory serves, this dialogue even happens on a black screen.  But it immediately tells you who these characters are and what their dynamic is: they're both brash and profane, Ken is an optimist, Ray is a pessimist, Ray is a bit childish, Ken is more mature."

And I feel like you can most certainly ""show"" even with dialogue. I feel like it's like the difference between ""showing"" a character having a conversation with the irs, for example, and having that character awkwardly ""tell"" a friend they're having financial issues. this is my understanding anyway, though I'm kind of a noob to this whole drama-writing thing.

The movie is relentless: with the exception of the opening monologue, everything we learn we're shown. Even the bits that seem like they're telling -- I would argue -- are heavily balanced towards showing.   For example: the possibly-infamous 'looking for redemption' line. Sure, she's telling Max (and us) what she thinks she's looking for. And that might be what she's really out to find. But I think it's far more revealing than that: it tells us that she doesn't know what she's looking for. She wants so many different + contradictory things that the only way she can think of to answer the question is: redemption. Plus, she's hardly got time to explain her psychology to us or Max! So a line that seems hilariously expository is actually showing us a great deal about who this woman is, even if that's not necessarily what she thinks she's telegraphing."

Screenwriting,391868,maxis2k,6,Tue Jun 9 03:04:14 2015 UTC,"While I don't normally think of Spielberg being a good example of 'showing', the opening to Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the better examples I can think of off hand.  Over the course of some 7 minutes, there's maybe 10 lines of dialogue.  Everything else is visual examples that set the setting, mood and flow.    The jungle setting is not specific, but it doesn't have to be.  We know he's somewhere in South America because of all the Olmec/Mayan inspired carvings and one character with a thick Hispanic accent.  I almost think they didn't need to give us a visual 'South America -1936' tagline to tell us.  All the following visual cues are enough to engage the viewer without specifically stating the location.  You keep seeing Indy following a path of looking at landmarks.  Then pull out a map to make sure he is on the right track.  So obviously he is searching for something.  We don't have to know he's an archeologist.  For all we know, he's some crazy mercenary for hire or even the villain.  But we are told (visually) that he is looking for something.  Which is just reaffirmed over and over by his companions actions.  Most important to me is the flow of the scene.  It opens right away to a heavy atmosphere with the music developing tension and mystery.  So the viewer knows something is going to happen.  Which is quickly confirmed by one of Indy's companions threatening him with a gun.  Then poison darts.  Then a dead body.  Then traps in the temple, his other companion tricking him, a giant bolder and finally, a whole host of Hovitos warriors chasing him.  There's more action in this opening scene than in many full length movies.  And only two of these many examples have any dialogue explaining why they are happening.  But all of them can be recognized as a threat to the main character.  And that's why it is well done.  By the process of elimination and a strong visual focus, you basically go from questioning who these three random guys are to confirming the main character as Indy.    And probably most important, all of this sequence gets the viewer to rally around Indy.  Even if we still don't know his intentions.  He could be good, chaotic neutral or bad.  But the audience still ends up rooting for him to escape unharmed.  And with almost none of that character development coming from dialogue.  In fact, the Belloc dialogue only adds to the mystery of who Indy is and doesn't get explained until halfway through the movie."

Like BB King couldn't play the blues.    Spielberg is one of the all-time greats of showing-not-telling.  Every filmmaker with any chops marvels at his visual storytelling.  Jim Cameron was completely floored at the DGA tribute when Spielberg revealed that he made up the Flying Wing fight in Raiders on the spot.  No planning, no storyboards.  He just saw it in his head and started shooting."
Screenwriting,391868,maxis2k,-1,Mon Jun 8 23:27:20 2015 UTC,"I think some of his works are truly brilliant.  Like the Raiders example I gave above or pretty much all of Empire of the Sun.  A prime example of showing rather than telling and subtle directing.  But some of his other stuff is just downright awkward or fails to do what he intended to do.  Jurrasic Park being a big example of this in my mind.  But that's just my opinion.  Obviously yours is different.  And honestly, most good directors are able to come up with scenes in their heads.  My personal favorite director, Robert Zemeckis, said he basically had to improvise the entire movie of Back to the Future 2.  Between constant problems with special effects, limited angles on the Universal lot and three different time periods.  It had to have major changes from the script all the time.  That's kind of the directors job.  To take the writer/producers concepts and make them work on set."

It adds to the effect of when they finally sit down at the bar next to each other and start talking about their problems.

Even though some of the information on screen ""tells"" us that the astronauts are dying (life status bars, etc.), there's no dialogue and not even any music.

Screenwriting,392agk,Diomedes13,5,Mon Jun 8 19:03:50 2015 UTC,"Very long description of my experience with Asylum.,  sorry on set, and a bit chatty.  Ive worked for Asylum, and also have been on thier sets and watched them operate.  Working for them:  Something I said I would never do, but I ended up working for LLP,(bad Hallmark/Lifetime/Spike),as a Gaffer and Camera Op for several shows, and I said I would never do that.  My friend had a show coming up and needed a Best Boy.  I went for it.  Step down, but hes a great contact and owns a lot of lighting gear( do this movie, get great deals on gear to shoot my own shorts)  After a meeting, tech scouts, notes, orders compiled,  Asylum bailed.  I was expecting it.  The DP and Gaffer wanted Baloon Lights and Condors (lighting cranes).  Way bigger then Asylum wants.  They still owe me $1000,  but I wrote that week and the money off, and moved on.  I knew it wouldnt work because I saw them on set once, in action, and it was fucking pathetic.   I had heard stories forever of course,  but didnt expect how bad it truely was.  They had some poor looking young kids as thier grip/electric.  It was a daylight shoot, and they needed to light a black dude to match the white people.  The directors just yelling to hurry up.  The DP sleps the camera over, and tosses it on his shoulder.  Total obedience, detatchment and defeat,  all at once.  I know this camera guy.  Met him when we both were shooting a doc years ago.  Then he operated for one day, on one of those terrible Spike westerns I gaffed. Hes a douche, and thought he was an amazing camera man.   Guess life and Asylum put him in his place,  I havent seen him in years.   Probably working back home in the midwest somewhere now, or teaching film at a school.  Anyways,  the dirty lighting guys rush a tuengsten light out from a small cube truck (far from movie truck, maybe film school shoot size,   maybe).   A blonde open face 2K goes up on a stand. But its tuengsten, not daylight. Probably because Asylum is to cheap to actually rent HMI lights.  So they slap a full blue correction gel on it.   That will knock it down a stop to almost pointless on the California sun.    And they shoot one take, and rush to the next piece they need.  I said bye to my friend who was stunt driving, and left.  I then knew, that as a DP, it was pointless to shoot for Asylum.  You wouldnt be able to get one shot for your reel with that asshole director that runs thier ""movies"".  Also, I love Asian School girls.  My current Korean GF recognized one of em, and said she sleeps with any DJ she comes across.  If I am single, im looking to buy a mac laptop and a cross fader or something.  I also watched it, and felt the one girl decided she wasnt ok with the shitty movie, so they wrote her out with that suicide scene.  I am writing from set with 2 producers that broke away from that shirty LLP company, and now are producing Union shows.  Nice to see other people get out of the trenches, and move up to better paying shows."

While there are a lot of writers who think they're great but cursed by a system that forces them to toil in obscurity, in reality, that's not how it goes. Real, good writing doesn't go undiscovered in Hollywood: there are just too many people looking for it.  If you're at the point where showing your material to pros and representatives feels exciting rather than scary, then it's time to make the move. That's the best next step, and the only way to get your career started as a writer. It's a necessary step: it says to everyone, this guy believes in himself enough to uproot his life and give it a shot. But if you don't believe in yourself enough to launch your career in earnest, why should anyone else?  I came out to LA three years ago to do a masters in screenwriting. I've been finished with the program for a year, and only now am I getting to the point where I feel like my work meets my own standards. So far, I've been rewarded for the things I've written that I know are good: meetings, interest from agents and representatives. Still it takes time. Take how long you think it will take, and add three months. The good news is: in that time, you continue to improve."

Screenwriting,393hhd,MidtownWest,4,Tue Jun 9 00:06:39 2015 UTC,"OP, this is really more of a life question than a screenwriting question, which is okay.  There are several things to consider here:  Your immigration status is going to be much more of an impediment to your career than a lack of degree will be.  I would speak to any other people you know who successfully emigrated and see how they were able to do it.  It might be worth finishing your degree in America, or finishing your degree in Germany and then taking a job in the US to secure your immigration status.  But, real talk, I am definitely not a lawyer.  The other thing to consider is that being a working screenwriter is incredibly incredibly difficult, even for people born in America (or even in LA).  I'm hesitant to advise you to drop out of school to pursue a lottery ticket, although of course your life is your own.  Have you considered trying to get into the German industry?  There are lots of tax incentives (to my knowledge) in the EU that require a certain percentage of the crew/above the line to be of certain nationalities.  Something to consider.  Good luck OP!"
Screenwriting,393hhd,beardsayswhat,2,Tue Jun 9 00:49:08 2015 UTC,"I read here that a degree means nothing in the film industry, but people around me advice to finish my degree(since my school is well-known) because in the US people in fact do look if you have a degree especially if you are a foreigner trying to break into Hollywood.    It's much easier to get a work visa if you have a degree in your chosen field. That said, you need a sponsoring employer. If you're truly serious I suggest transferring schools and getting here with a student visa and taking steps to get a green card.  Because of the immigration rules in the US, it's not particularly nice for the film industry because almost everyone can be classified as a freelancer/self-employed. That said, I'm not aware of any Germany/America specific rules; for instance I know that allies in the Iraqi war (like Australia) are favored during the green card lottery.  As for the wisdom of dropping everything and coming to Hollywood.... well there are a million opinions about that. I wouldn't rule out starting a screenwriting career closer to home in Germany or the UK before jumping to the US."

Screenwriting,393hhd,D_B_R,2,Tue Jun 9 09:15:59 2015 UTC,"Like a lot of questions, this one has a complex answer.   You certainly do not need a degree to do the work. If you can do the work, you can do the work. Nobody says, ""Oh, I liked this script, but the writer didn't get a great degree, so I'm not interested.""  That being said, the screenwriting and development community in Hollywood does have a culture, and that culture is dominated by people who got liberals arts degrees from elite schools. There are a lot of Harvard, Berkeley, Amherst etc grads in the business. It certainly doesn't hurt you if these people feel that you are ""one of them"" - which doesn't mean that you have the same degree, but does mean that you have that sort of world-view.   There are plenty of exceptions, I'm just saying, in my experience, it helps, some.   I also have to agree with Beardsayswhat about starting your career in Germany. The simple truth is that there is no location in the world that is less friendly to new talent than Los Angeles - but Hollywood is really really good at poaching top talent from other markets.   Heck, honestly, even places with no film-making infrastructure are friendlier to new talent than Hollywood is. There's a reason why filmmakers like Gareth Evans, Gareth Edwards, and Cary Fukunaga went to locations with minimal filmmaking infrastructure to make their breakthrough films.   Germany, obviously, has a lot more of an industry than most places, but even still - friendlier to new talent than Hollywood. And unless your English is indistinguishable from that of a native speaker, you are at a huge disadvantage as a screenwriter. (I don't see any issues with the language in your post, but it's something to think about)."

Screenwriting,393hhd,boopk,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:02:42 2015 UTC,"-No, you don't need a degree. Yes, it helps.  -If screenwriting is your ultimate goal, I'm not sure how much you stand to benefit from starting a career in Germany writing in German. I know of numerous directors that come from all over the world, but can't think of many screenwriters. There are British and Australian screenwriters that break into hollywood, I think partly because they share the English language, partly because they have strong film industries to develop talent. Not to say it doesn't happen or can't happen. Strategizing on your best chances to get into Hollywood screenwriting, I don't think this is it.  -Immigration will be your greatest challenge to breaking into Hollywood. Student visa is one option. It will get you here, you can take film classes, make friends, get internships, learn the business, etc. However, once you graduate, you will have a 1 year grace period to get a sponsor or secure an artist visa. You won't get sponsored as a screenwriter. You will have to take some other kind of job and they aren't easy to come by. The studios as a policy don't sponsor. Artist visas require you to be established. Actors, writers, and directors with big credits aren't guaranteed to get this, though they usually have the resources to make it happen.  -Assuming you don't have immense wealth, one big challenge will be how to support yourself while giving yourself enough time to write. I wish I had an answer for you. I tried writing while working, but as you state, it's very difficult to make time and stay focused. When I was in school, Malcolm Spellman (90% sure it was him) came into one of my classes and told us how he would work his ass off to save up enough money that he could take a year to focus completely on writing, write for a year and repeat. I am currently subscribed to this method and I like it. I have a degree in Civil Engineering, I worked as an engineer for two years. In engineering and in most industries, you can't do that. When a company hires you, they invest a lot in you to start and they need you to work for them for a few years to make that investment pay off. However, as others have said, if you are dead set on moving to LA, your chances of getting an engineering company to sponsor you is much better than getting a sponsor from the film industry.  -Your biggest asset as a writer will be your personal perspective. Go out in the world and find your perspective. I worked for a big film director and when he graduated from university (many years ago) his school sponsored him to travel abroad for a year. They believed in him as an artist and felt the best way to feed his talent was to arm him with cultural knowledge. It worked for him and for several of his classmates who are also big players in the film industry. That takes money to do, but maybe find some crazy summer job that will pay enough to support you the rest of the year. Work on a fishing boat in Alaska, become a hacker, become a CI for the FBI, anything that takes you on an adventure, introduces you to people from all different backgrounds, give yourself experiences that will give you stories worth telling, whatever that means to you."

This is a holdover from the Title IX days, where the agencies started to get nervous about discriminatory hiring lawsuits. Requiring a college degree became an easy workaround to continue the practice of hiring mostly white males in an industry where most of the real learning is done on the job.   In your case, the cache of being European, multi-lingual, and able to work overseas may give you an edge over other candidates. But that's assuming you have the ability to work legally in the US in the first place.   If you're only looking to sell material, it doesn't matter.

One of the helpful things about it is that each reel/sequence is heading for an important moment at the end.  That keeps things from meandering too much.  It also reinforces the Field/Hauge/McKee/Snyder structure:   13- catalyst 26 - Act I break 39 - Pinch 52 - MidPoint 65 - Pinch 78 - End Of Act II 91 - Showdown/Battle 104 - End   So the first section is about setting up the world and characters, and moving things forward until the Catalyst/Inciting Incident/Call To Adventure around page 13.  If you write 2-3 page scenes, each section is 4-6 scenes.  Think about the economy that enforces.  You have 6 scenes to set up the world, the characters, their situation, and get the story started by raising the dramatic question and confronting the hero with the main issue.

That being said, I use it less and less now, or at least, less and less consciously.   (Context: I've had a couple of pro jobs, nothing produced).  Like any structure, the thing that matters is digesting it. Understand it, test it against movies you love, and then let it go from you conscious mind and just write.   The way I learned it (Ted Braun was the teacher I had for that class. Fantastic teacher!) it's more about a process than about ""this sequence does X, that sequence does Y."" And the way I think about it, it's really a series of nested three-act stories. (Each sequences has three acts, each scene has three acts) and when I'm stuck, occasionally, I still of it consciously in that way.   I'm sure my liberal-arts bias is showing here, but I'm a big fan of learning different models and testing them out, wrestling with them, and taking what you can use and discarding the rest. That is to say, you don't read Descartes because he's got that proof-that-god-exists thing figured out. You read him to wrestle with his argument and poke holes in it. (This is very different from how, say, engineering students approach things: the laws of physics are the laws of physics. Engineers - smartly - don't waste time arguing with them.

Howard worked closely with Daniel, and the books reflect that. Also Prof. Howard is a much-sought-after prof in the USC writing program because he's smart as hell. I had to drop my one class with him after two weeks, but even in that short period of time he taught me things I still use all the time.   FWIW, both of these books were available before I got into USC in 2004.

If we view the three act structure as four equal parts, with act two being split into two equal portions, it's really just splitting those parts down a second time and looking at each of the segments/sequences as unique.  Which is cool, because it's basically telling you that you need to make the first half of Act One different than the second half.

I love the main character, obviously playing off of the ""one sane person in an irrational world."" She almost seems a little too normal however, like just a blank slate for the audience to experience the absurd world through. Is there more too her? Why is she visiting this horse factory? Can we assume that she has a deep love for them? (I.E: Tina from Bob's Burgers). Does the rest of the script go into the fact that she's different from the rest of the world? Trouble with parents? Or is it just the conflict of seeing ghost horses?  Another note I have that there happens to be a lot of personal voice outside of the dialogue. Which is great! But, it does seem like it some of it is needless in the context that no one can actually see it in the show. It only makes your script longer.  I really like what I've read. Perhaps I can read more?

But peradventure somehow the screenplay ends up having an overwhelming sense of similarity with that written idea (I really can't imagine how that can be possible), then yes the person can come after you with a law suit. And it's not impossible for it to be successful.  It is possible because the person has put the idea into a written form that is dated (although a more credible database is preferable). However, the person will still need to register for copyright before he can claim an infringement in US. In several previous plagiarism and copyright infringement legal cases, the court looks for two main things: A really very strong similarity between the two written works, and evidence that the accused came in contact with the written work prior to penning his allegedly copied work. The later is usually tough to prove, but once proven typically seals the case. At such a stage, if big financiers are already attached, they'll typically opt to settle the case outside court if things haven't already gotten too messy.  But really, don't worry. The screenplay will surely end up being much bigger, fuller and thus sufficiently different from that idea."
Screenwriting,391m30,WriterDuet,3,Mon Jun 8 16:19:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'd just keep it under a page.  You're just reminding them of the pitch they heard. You want them to be like ""Oh yeah! I remember that cool pitch. Let's bring him in."" This document shouldn't be doing the heavy lifting. Plus nobody is gonna want to read more than a page (if that) anyway. You want to be able to pitch in person to answer questions they  might have."
Screenwriting,391m30,slupo,2,Mon Jun 8 18:27:14 2015 UTC,"Every detail you put in writing is potentially another thing they'll dislike and use to justify a pass. Conversely, if they do like something, then you've potentially locked yourself into following that path because that's what they wanted to buy. A written pitch document carries more weight than an oral one, it feels more solid. With an oral pitch there's a certain amount of fog-of-war, which is to your advantage as each listener is picking up on the fragments they like - and they're the bits that stick in the memory.  So be as concise and vague as possible. Be careful of what you're committing yourself to. There are writers who don't give out written records of their pitches. Frankly, if they need to look at a document to remind them of your pitch, then you probably haven't wowed them enough to stand out from the 200 other pitches that season.  In your case, what they basically want is something to take talking points from, should they decide to have a conversation with you. So you're looking at a page. A two-page pilot synopsis is a bit too much detail - if they're interested they are allowed to ask for more detailed information. I'd say a paragraph for each act, without worrying much about the secondary or tertiary characters or plots. At this stage it's more checking how viable the main characters and story engine are than a single episode's content."

Don't look for exceptions in order to say ""Oh, see, they did it, so I can!"" Rather, look for exceptions so you can see, ""How did they handle the problems that being an exception created?""  e.g., let's look at the two examples cited in this thread so far.  Scream has one of the great misdirect openings of all time. Maybe the best since Psycho. The casting (and marketing!) of the film played into this. You were supposed to think that Drew Barrymore was playing the lead. This made the ending of that scene all the more shocking.   Star Wars, on the other hand, doesn't give us an obvious lead early. I highly doubt that anybody thought C3PO was the lead of the movie. But it's worth pointing out that the opening sequence is launching the plot - this is about how the plans get to Luke, which sends him on the whole quest.   Star Wars and Scream both have something in common: the stakes of the opening scenes are incredibly sharp and clear. These aren't world-building or set-up scenes. These are scenes with huge, life-and-death stakes. The clear conflicts in those scenes help us put a tremendous amount of faith in the filmmakers."

They might ultimately use their control to implement your ideas, but it's always going to be their thing.  And as far as tools, if I was writing something like WINTER'S BONE, I would be very sparse in my description, I would make sure that the dialogue didn't become too hucksploitation or too generic, I would call out specific geography and clothing to root it in a place.  There are lots of tricks, but most of them are taking what's in your head and making it CLEAR to whoever's reading it, which is much harder than it sounds."

Yes, your script is the first thing that got done, the first piece that was in place. And chances are when the director comes on he or she is going to have a tremendous influence over that, as well. Plus casting. Selecting the DP. Plus costume and sets. Approval of which forks are on the table. Not to mention what's actually going on in the scene between action and cut. Then editing. Discussing music with the composer. All of these things to varying degrees.  Your actual screenplay as some sort of inviolable bible is going to be long forgotten at some point in there.  So yeah, the director. The director.  Now, it sounds like you're assuming the director isn't going to have a clue about what sort of film it's supposed to be. Almost certainly that's not going to be the case. Presumably the director isn't going to be a clueless idiot. Presumably he or she is going to have - I don't want to assume too much here, but - much more experience with cinematically rendering a story than you.  So that's another thing: get ready for the fact that you're never going to be 100% satisfied with any film you've written. Even the people I know who have written great movies feel that way. ""You know, if he'd just left in that part where they..."" That sort of thing.  But that's a whole other can."

And if plot details/ motivations aren't missing when the songs are missing, then the songs are superfluous and you could just write this as a straight play.  I'd remove most specific blocking, and lighting notes. Your director will do a better job making specific stage pictures, and your lighting designer will do the same.  Does the ladder being on the left affect the plot? Is the soft blue light with a spot on Becky mentioned in the song? Is her looking down sadly a character trait that get's mentioned later on?  Things should be in your script because they affect the story. Sometimes lighting is story specific.  In Curtains, Frank first sees Niki in a pink special, so the pink lighting is essential. A physical farce has very specific humorous stage pictures (The Foreigner includes a diagram of the original set so directors can mimic it if they desire.)  Try reading South Pacific or The Music Man but skipping the music. If you've never seen the show before you would be lost.  TL;DR: Even plays don't need lighting, staging or actor notes.

Screenwriting,38z2d2,scsm,0,Mon Jun 8 01:29:57 2015 UTC,"Animation boards are often Photoshop templates with a black space at the bottom onto which dialogue is transferred from a pre-written script into a sequence of frames as shown here: http://tobyshelton.blogspot.com/2011/03/button-of-doom-2010-megamind-dvd.html?m=1   Rarely if ever is animation storyboarded first...a sketch artist will work with the director, writer, character artists, and so on to rough out greyscale sequences that will undergo further editing and refinement, all based upon a preexisting script...written before storyboarding.   Almost all storyboards are made from a pre-existing script written by someone else other than the story artist. It would be possible for a single person or small team to write and sketch sequences simulaneaously but...there are a number of reasons this is not the workflow for mainstream studios: expense time skillsets...  Edit: another set of examples: http://www.louiedelcarmen.com/gallery/  Just looking over Fury Road storyboard search results...these are much, much more refined boards than those used for animation...more like concept art. They undoubtedly informed Miller's ""writing"" but it is super rare for ""storyboards"" of that expense and  quality to be created straight from beat sheets/outlines before a standard script of some kind has been written. Pixar's films for example start as well-reviewed scripts...then later are boarded by a team, with entire sequences changing as the greyscale storyboard ""film"" is reviewed...almost all of the initial storyboard artwork is an attempt to capture the original script. A famous counter-example though is Peter De Seve's creation of the Scrat character in Ice Age...he just sat down and sketched out that funny introductory scene of Scrat sniffing around on ice for his acorn even though De Seve was only hired as a character artist.  The tutorial by Louie del Carmen mentioned on this page is worthwhile if you are an artist interested in such a workflow: http://factualfiction.com/lighthouse/storyboardtips/"

Greyscale sketches can be seen as a kind of vocabulary written in an alphabet of visual language unique to each studio.   There's a huge team of people with significant influence over story...very interesting important confluence of talent, which ought to be seen as an organic process unique to each production (from Job's design of Pixar's main building to Lassater's Brain Trust)...many teams decay over time, develop their own group-personalities, unintentional subconscious aesthetics and so on...super fascinating subject which warrants much more appreciation than a reddit post...in fact part of the reason Pixar exists is because Disney was unable to maintain, evolve with, or even recognize such factors.   Edit: Just idle speculation...if someone can ""get these factors right"" such an endeavor probably offers one of the most lucrative lasting opportunities for making a true fortune in entertainment (apart from video games). There will always be room for the next Pixar because these factors are in such flux - even within the life of a single person as a storyteller - and the rewards for getting it right consecutively several films in a row are phenomenal.

(They have to love it more than one other film if they're both ten minutes in order to schedule it. They have to love it more than four other films to schedule if if they're 10 minutes and it's 40.)  2) Assuming you have limited resources (time, money, etc) a shorter film will usually look a little better because you'll be able to spend more of your resources on each moment."

Screenwriting,38zdf6,holomntn,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:20:16 2015 UTC,"What does the story demand?  What do YOU enjoy?  By the first, I'm acknowledging you inherently know the answer to your question. You'll know if you linger too long or scratch too deep at something, you'll know if you've littered it with non-essentials, you'll know if you brought enough to light for a compelling tale. etc etc etc  By the second, I'm saying -- just like we each sort of have a thematic sweet spot or a sweet spot for a particular genre, we may have one for ""the perfect amount of time"" as well. Shorts are tricky buggers, if you ask me. If you have a chance to take in a film festival somewhere --- where you can overindulge in a bunch of shorts at once --- do that. See if something strikes you. Maybe you marvel: ""how could they possibly say so much in 7 minutes? I wanna try that."" Or you see something at 14 minutes you wish went on for another hour. Not that it should, mind you. (Note the difference between ""could"" and ""should""....) Conversely, you might fidget thru a 30 minute short, all while noting to yourself everything YOU would've done to slice it down to 20....   All that to say --- your story probably has a sweet spot too. Don't ""force"" things. Articulate. Emote. Entice. Intrigue. Inspire. Don't overindulge yourself or your readers/audience.

Each festival has different requirements, but 10 minutes will pretty much keep you within guidelines anywhere.  If your goal is to put it online, I really encourage you to watch other shorts. This is a great resource: https://www.shortoftheweek.com  Notice how most good shorts hover around the 10 minute goal. Notice how the ones that exceed have a tendency to drag. Sitting in front of a computer is so much different than sitting in a theater or even your living room.  The majority of people here will tell you to write your story as long as you think it needs to be. I disagree. I think it is part of your job as a writer to consider your audience, whether that be someone watching a produced film or a reader taking the time to read your unsolicited script."

An amazing 5 minute short is better than an okay 10 minute short. Pretty much anything under 20 minutes is fine. But if your film has to be 30 or 45 minutes in order to tell your story, then make it so. No one is going to discount your short film for being too short or too long as long as it is good."

Generally with shorts it's important to remember that less can be more. You don't have to tell a complete story or a complicated one. Short films can be free of the constrains of feature length films.  If you're having trouble keeping the themes on track you may have too many themes. Start with one, write the whole script as if that will be the only theme. Then rewrite, adding a theme, another layer. The keep is to know when to stop and that takes practice and time.  I film with too much thematically will feel clunky and awkward."

It's never enjoyable, and I think makes the audience much less likely to be impacted. As humans, we like discovering things...it allows us to own them.  Theme is an aspect of story for which it's perfectly fine to be ambiguous. Some of the best films don't have a clear theme, people disagree on the theme, or have multiple themes.  To put it another way, themes reveal themselves from the sum total of the story. If you have something to say about the human condition, concentrate on writing a great story, with great characters, and your themes will come through without you ever giving them a conscious thought."

Screenwriting,38y2td,AstroAgama,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:28:14 2015 UTC,"Okay so I read up until the flashback because that's just a wall of text and I'm too tired for that.  Okay so here goes.  First this seems somewhat aimless. Would you really watch these guys just sit around on tv? I assume more stuff happens but is any of it something really engaging or is it stuff most people go through.  The puke on dick part was funny in concept but not well executed. Very few people would so readily admit that. Maybe if the guys pressured John into saying it and then immediately regret the decision after he blurts it out. Other than that I don't really see any other jokes. It's not like unfunny jokes that didn't land I just don't see jokes. Was the ""I'm here to watch you kill yourself by jumping off the balcony"" suppose to be a joke about the game or what?  Bar Cesar the characters are not distinguishable. They all seem like tropes. Cesar = preppy douche. Everyone else = stoner waster. I don't think I have a reason to like any of them except maybe John because he made me laugh.  I think at least one female would help here. Add some diversity. They all seem white and straight too. All cookie cutter.  I know you said content stuff but you need to give at least basic descriptions of the characters for contextual reasons. If these guys are college level it's socially acceptable. If they're in their 30's it's weird. If they're in their 50's it's funny.   You're new and there's a tendency in new writers to write what they know and in truth that's the easiest thing to do. But if all you know is hanging around with your friends, playing games and drinking there's nothing wrong with being more outlandish. Again this is a small snippet but people make their decisions faster than I did so try to start on a better foot than you just did.   Good luck and keep going!"
Screenwriting,38y2td,joe12south,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:54:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks on phone ATM I'll reply later, but it's college kids. Pilot episode starts two days before school starts.   Yes Cesar is the frat ass hole, John doesn't smoke, Frank&Jeff are planning on joining Cesar's frat, and Dylan is the kid who lets everything get to him. Also Cesar always talks shit to Dylan.  I'll read the rest of the feedback when I get home.  Edit: You are right, I honestly forgot to state that ""School starts in two days"". I haven't written the characters personalities, and setting yet.   People are really that fast to judge work? Wow, good to know. I was planning on not ending it after the club, and keep it going. Then I had another amazing idea where in episode two it will start from the club flashback, and move on to the next day where school starts, then it would start skipping around. Might have to change that now.  You are right, atm the show is just aimless, well at least the pilot. I should 100% change that, by jumping to school, and adding/taking out some of the content.  You SHOULD like John. John in real life is...""unique"" literally. He has the best luck, but he is so awkward. He is the animal he hates the most, a fucking duck.  The jumping off part is just a really small taste of the Cesar vs Dylan rivalry.   Thanks for the feed back, i'll work on it."

I feel this is a bit more in-line with how people would behave in that situation. Maybe one guy should be rich, and the other poor. Maybe the rich guy is stressed out because his parents might cut him off. On the other hand, maybe the poor guy is stressed because, well, he doesn't have the resources to properly raise a child. You could show the contrast in character as the two guys wait for the results of the test, and set up for a big reveal at the end.  Hope this helps! Good luck!"

Screenwriting,38w3rc,highpitchwendy,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:12:59 2015 UTC,"I only had time to get through the first 10 pages for now but I'm interested in reading more later when I have the time. I don't think you have a problem with the action or describing the internet scenes, I had no trouble reading them, understanding them and visualizing them.   I have to say I almost gave up after page 3, Nolan saying All in the Family was just another drab sitcom killed me! I was arguing with the character out loud, ""Archie Bunker was one of the best characters in the history of television!"" But I powered through it, as hard it was, lol.   I like the story so far and I find this world fascinating. My wife's friend was cam girl for a few years and we had no idea. But when we seen her with a brand new BWM and decked out in Marc Jacobs she came clean and it was shocking the amount of money these girls can make but then again you could tell she had some strange Daddy issues and this was her way to dealing with them as disgusting as it was.   Back to your story, the good is the story and characters but the Dialog could use some work for as it comes off as ""on the nose"" and descriptive in a way that it only seems to be there to inform of us of plot when you should be showing us. A good example is when Cooper and Nora first appear (Nora and Nolan look similar and you should try to not double on characters with names that start with the same letter, I would change one or the other) their conversation is only to tell the audience that Ben and Pheely are having problems, this was already brought to our attention in the previous seen with her Dad, so no need to repeat it, especially right after we just read it. I think you could delete this whole scene and just show Ben outside waiting for Pheely and when she pulls up they have their conversation and you can let the tension between the two lead to more mystery. Right now it's all out in the open thanks to Nora and Cooper and I've lost interest in what happens with Ben and Pheely after this point.   Also you had worried about the action being wordy but it's Dialog that really needs to be picked apart. Again from the scene above when Pheely asks Ben if Nora and Cooper are still inside his answer is cryptic and a bit long:  BEN  They were half an hour ago, I've been out here the whole time, so honestly I'm not sure.   You could change this to something as simple as:  BEN  I don't know, I think so.  PHEELY  What do you mean you don't know? Have you been out here smoking the whole time?  BEN  And waiting for you for the last half hour.   PHEELY   Whatever.    Pheely disgusted in anger storms past him on her way inside.   Then cut to inside and then introduce us to Copper and Nora. Have one them ask why she's so mad and then let the tension flow between the group. Ben get's defensive so Nora jumps in to side with Pheely, then Cooper comes in to defend Ben and so on...  This sets you up with tension which is good and keeps the story alive. Make us wonder why he's so angry and she's being so dismissive to him, it will make the story pop.  I recently found some information on Dialog that really helped me and I think it would serve as a good example for you. It's all about dialog rhythm and how each character has their own motives when in conversation. It's a short read with great insight:  https://gideonsway.wordpress.com/2011/06/29/rhythm-the-pulse-of-your-script/  If you like that, check out his other post, there all very informative. Again I like the script so far and where it's headed, just give a good once over and make it as compelling as you can, give us drama, conflict, tension and make us want a resolution but force us to wait until the very end to satisfy us. Good Luck and I'll finish this later today-tomorrow. I hope this helped."
Screenwriting,38w3rc,Emmydriven,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:08:33 2015 UTC,"that feedback helps so much, the dialogue example really works, and I never even thought that I might be rehashing something that was already established.  I think my dialog is a bit vague too, because the scene where Nolan mentions ""All in the Family"", he was actually being sarcastic. Basically, he's exposing Pheely's youth and lack of culture thereof. So the scene is actually sort of an homage to All in the Family. I just wanted to make sure you knew because I wouldve been pulling my hair out as well haha.   its funny because when she actually becomes a camwhore, I was thinking of having her buy a BMW after her father dies. This episode sort of kicks off Pheely's descent into exhibitionism, and you're supposed to question whether or not it's admirable. She sort of a female Walter White. She discovers something that's seen as deplorable, but it makes her feel alive."

""Their brand was about the individual voices of the show.""   Although I think the line between the two can be blurry. e.g., part of how CBS established its brand was by having 50,000* separate NCSI, CSI, or JAG shows.   (that's an estimate. It might be low).   The linked article has been updated since it was first posted, which just reinforced my opinion that these comments are simply out-of-touch with the market. The additions includes this line:   ""For the first 25 minutes, nothing happens. You just meet these charming people,"" Lauren Graham agreed, describing the pilot. ""You would never have that today! There would have to be explosions before the first commercial.    How many half-hour of the half-hour comedy pilots picked up this year featured any explosions at all?   The funny thing is I think they're talking around the real reason why that show wouldn't get made on a network today: it's built around and for older women, an audience which the major networks seem to have zero interest in serving. Even though Golden Girls earned plenty of younger fans, I don't think it'd get the chance today - it'd be written off as niche entertainment.  But we live in a world where Transparent got made. Where ABC Family and Lifetime and other channels are looking for original series and there is this huge, voracious appetite for inexpensive material to serve a variety of niche audiences."

Not only is it harder to get a show like GG made today, but it's harder to get a show like Ally McBeal made or even a Boston Legal.  And don't get me started on the lack of a true successor West Wing. Hour long shows have gotten progressively darker over the last decade (largely due to the influence of cable, actually).   Everyone is too busy chasing the next House of Cards. What passes for ""light"" one-hours these days is Orange is the New Black.  Great show, but it's not exactly a spiritual sibling to Gilmore Girls.  Now that the USA network has abandoned their ""blue skies"" motif, there really isn't a single net specifically looking for lighter one-hour fare.  But it's all cyclical.  Things can only get so dark before ""light"" and ""fun"" become novelties again.  The success of Jane the Virgin has me hoping that the sunlight might finally be cracking through the clouds."

Screenwriting,38t898,devolka,2,Sat Jun 6 21:18:58 2015 UTC,I would suggesting speaking to a lawyer about this.  My thought is that if you are lifting a phrase or a sentence or even a couple of sentences you might be fine.  If you're lifting a whole speech or a conversation with very specific language that may be another story.  Either way I would contact an lawyer who specializes in this.   Personally I would advice against this.

Screenwriting,38t898,slupo,2,Mon Jun 8 01:43:42 2015 UTC,"When you say dialogue, do you mean using the exact audio from that documentary or simply quoting them/borrowing the line?"
Screenwriting,38t898,wrytagain,4,Sat Jun 6 17:15:17 2015 UTC,For example right now I am writing a story about someone who is an FBI agent.. and I am researching related topics so I watched a documentary on the Secret Service looking for ideas for a scene. I heard some dialogue from a secret service agent that I would like to use in my scene when my FBI agent is being interviewed about  the work they do.   If I have my fictional character in my screenplay saying the same dialogue as the real life agent in the documentary is that copyright infringement?
Screenwriting,38t898,jabbasi,8,Sat Jun 6 17:20:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't think so. Documentaries are classified as real-life movies. Movies have quoted other movies many times. Trademarks only restrict use in connection with a product or a company name.   Field-specific common knowledge is ""common"" only within a particular field or specialty. It may include facts, theories, or methods that are familiar to people within that discipline. For instance, you may not need to cite a reference to Piaget's developmental stages in a paper for an education class or give a source for your description of a commonly used method in a biology report—but you must be sure that this information is so widely known within that field that it will be shared by your readers.   When in doubt, ask for permission."

The zombies are supernatural in nature and have agency (They give speeches). Are you going to go into this backstory?   A suggestion: I know this is horror comedy and characters don’t necessarily have to act as they would in real life, but it would still be nice if Jo felt the need to get back to her family and protect them, get them the hell out of Dodge.

Using poor style in correspondence with industry professionals really does hurt your chances. When it comes time for you to try to sell a script, the last thing you want to do is lower expectations by presenting yourself unprofessionally. Production companies pass on hundreds of scripts for every one they take on, and in order to streamline the process they look for any reason to reject one and move on to the next. Concerns like those I've raised about your subject line may seem superficial, but they're a huge red flag to anyone who handles queries all day long and knows what to expect.  A better subject line would have been straightforward, brief, and plainly formatted, such as ""Seeking advice"", or something like that.

There are training courses you can take to become a SS.  However, you need to be sure it's something you want.

I posted this from mobile so I tried to make it as short as possible. I was doing a little bit of everything. Even helping with gaffing and sound. Most of the time we just kind of sit around and hold things for people. Besides what I mentioned in the body of the post. One of the guys has nothing to do besides the slate, that's literally all he does.

No, you flew the plane for a day, you are a pilot. Even if you are still inexperienced. And you SHOULD use it on your resume to get yourself on another production in a role you did, because you gained experience.

Screenwriting,38rb2w,theturc,4,Sat Jun 6 03:39:31 2015 UTC,"Like another commenter, I really do think that our enthusiasm for Obi-Wan in the prequels has little to do with the script or the directing. If you read the scripts... they contain nothing, no characterisation at all. Many of his actions make no sense given what's happening and (more particularly) Anakin's scripted behaviour.  Watching the film I don't think Obi-Wan balances out Anakin. Rather, I simply don't like Anakin as a scripted character or as a performance, and prefer watching Obi-Wan. Considering we are meant to be invested in Anakin's development and care about his fall, this is a problem. It's a problem that instead we just want to see more Obi-Wan as a distraction.  The script doesn't do the work to turn the ""evil character"" of the original films into someone we care about. We are never really pulled in to look through his eyes, feel his feelings.  Context outside of the film:   Going in (as a viewer at the time of release) Obi-Wan is the only character we know about beforehand. We remember him fondly from the other films. We automatically see him as our viewpoint character. (Darth Vader was an interesting character in the original films, but he was basically ""evil guy"" and we were never aligned with him.) Ewan MacGregor is a well-liked actor and personality and people are pre-disposed to wish him well.   In the film itself:   MacGregor puts in a great performance given the material he is dealing with. He knows this stuff is guff, but he treats it seriously, doesn't distance himself from it with his performance. His performance also brings out the best in others' scenes with him; you can tell he is giving them the reactions to bring out a better response. This means Obi-Wan ends up being the most enjoyable character, in the most enjoyable scenes. Only Ian McDiarmid keeps his game up to this level.   It's interesting to watch interviews with MacGregor at the time (e.g. Jonathan Ross, who slags off the films, and MacGregor just smiles cheekily and is professional but also doesn't deny it) and to see the behind the scenes footage of him in action (where he is making suggestions and trying to make it the best it can be, within the limitations of his position)."
Screenwriting,38rb2w,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:13:17 2015 UTC,"Some of the same things could be said about Alec Guinness and his performance as Obi-Wan. I don't know if the original trilogy Obi-Wan is really that much better of a character (he's the typical wise old man mentor) but Guinness helped make it into a more iconic character. Also, I don't think he thought very highly of A New Hope either, but he was still professional about it."
Screenwriting,38rb2w,allmilhouse,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:14:12 2015 UTC,"Guinnes was the one who made made Obi Wan into an iconic character because he was the first one to play Obi Wan. Ewan McGregor elevated it since EVERY SINGLE time someone bashes the prequels, they say: ""But Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan was fantastic!"""
Screenwriting,38rb2w,Slickrickkk,3,Sat Jun 6 16:26:55 2015 UTC,"To be sure McGregor (and all of the brits) elevate their roles beyond what is on the page, but I think our connection with Obi-Wan as a character is more than that.  I think one of the reasons is that Obi Wan is more of an every-man, work-a-day Jedi than THE CHOSEN ONE. He's a Jedi we can relate to. The whole shebang may be Anakin's story, but Obi-Wan is our guide into it."
Screenwriting,38rb2w,joe12south,6,Sat Jun 6 13:33:23 2015 UTC,"Simply put, from a screenwriting perspective, there's nothing interesting about any of the characters in the prequels. The dialogue isn't great, and the characters themselves are generally either horribly uninteresting, or borderline unlikeable. The main reason why people gravitate to Obi-Wan is because of Ewan MacGregor's fantastic portrayal of the character. There are very few actors who could have delivered dialogue THAT crappy. And that's part of what you want to remember; the screenplay itself is merely a blueprint, there are a LOT of other factors that go into creating memorable characters.   However, if you want to do something to resolve those issues beforehand, the number one tip I can give you is character banter. This adds life to your movie, and keeps it entertaining for everyone. This is what makes Pulp Fiction so great, because the dialogue isn't necessary to push the plot forward, but we still want it there. In addition, don't get too caught up in backstory. Backstory can be great for helping the viewers understand the characters, but, in the end, all that matters is what you show us. I hope this helps!"

That character is a theoretical one because it's not actually present in the writing, the performances, or the direction. Plot point =/= empathy and emotion, but plot point is all we get in the final results.  In the films, he is not full of inner conflict, he's just childish and poorly-rendered.

Is it ""Return of the Jedi bashing"" to point out that the ewoks are a bad choice for that film?  Some things work well in the prequels (some great designs, etc) and some things don't (poor dialogue, badly directed character scenes). As a film-viewer, it's natural to have a view on it. Many professional filmmakers and screenwriters have expressed an opinion on them - were they ""bashing""? Natalie Portman has said her career was almost ruined by appearing in them.   Portman: Star Wars had come out around the time of Seagull, and everyone thought I was a horrible actress. I was in the biggest-grossing movie of the decade, and no director wanted to work with me. Mike wrote a letter to Anthony Minghella and said, “Put her in Cold Mountain, I vouch for her.”   -- New York Magazine   But... It's not like we all have to agree on our opinions, or even pay attention to other people's opinions if we don't like them, right?  My own view is that they were disappointing, and that was because Lucas didn't have what he needed in terms of constraints and talent push-back, but they got better as he found his feet. (For the original trilogy, he we more part of a team than head guy - A New Hope was basically saved from mediocrity by the re-edit his wife did on the film.)"

Yes. Because those are the only hopes that exist. All hopes to be a professional screenwriter are ""long-shot"" hopes, at least in the aggregate. In the individual, it's binary. It's either 0% or 100%.  But sure. A service like the Black List is basically one in which the very very few who are worthy of the access their fees buy them are subsidized massively by the great hordes of people who aren't.   Am I missing some exceptional redeeming quality?   I think so. Now, I'm not sure Franklin would ever put it this way, so I'll just do my usual thing and speak for myself.  The exceptional redeeming quality of the Black List is that in those rare circumstances where the writer's work is going to get them noticed by legitimate, powerful Hollywood professionals, Franklin's service actually gets them noticed.  I guess you can think of it like a Fast Pass at Disneyland. You'd probably get there anyway with a great script, but you'll get there much faster with the Black List. And that's what we've seen happen with a small number of writers... in a way that basically never happens with anything else except the Nicholl.  The paradox, of course, is that everyone paying for the service has faith that they are among those rare few. The reason I hold it apart from all the other services is:   They're not charging hundreds or thousands of dollars for ONE person's opinion. They're not leading you on like Scientology with add-ons like ""Hey, you could be GREAT... but to get there, you need to give me another grand for my next level class..."" They are not on the periphery or the peri-periphery of the business. The people who have access to the screenplays are legitimate buyers and representatives, and they have actually converted some of the screenplays into employment for the writers... and production.   I completely agree with Franklin when he says ""Hey, if you don't think it's worth the money, stop giving it to us."" That's about as open a policy as anyone can expect.  Is it ethical to make money off of 100% of users when a full 99% of them don't have what it takes? I guess I'd say this... it's not what I choose to do, but if I did, I would choose to do it the way Franklin does it. He is the only one of the bunch out there that I think offers anything in the way of real, provable, repeatable value."

If I left it up, my 9 would have gotten it highlighted in the next email. Would it have led to offers of representation? Obviously, I can't prove that it would have, but I'm going to say it would have gotten some reads, and based on the positive review and the reaction of the one producer who read it, I think it would have gotten me a good run.  If I were trying to break in with this script, this would have been the best 125 bucks I could imagine spending. Instead of getting query letters ignored, I would have had people downloading and seeking it out.   I'm someone who started out very skeptical about the Blacklist - I think my initial reaction was ""great, another service making money off writers."" But Franklin's product and customer service had won me over even before this experiment… and this experiment cemented it for me.

Screenwriting,38pr4a,franklinleonard,-4,Sat Jun 6 03:37:59 2015 UTC,"A thread on the Done Deal forum posted by Jeff Lowell, describes his ""test"" of the Black List by submitting a pilot script he'd written some years ago and had much interest in. He reports he opened an anonymous account, wrote a fairly bland logline and had one download from an eager producer.  Nice.    But he also paid for two readings and got two ratings.  A 9+ which gets him on the ""shotgun loglines to producers"" list, and a 6 which gets you nothing.  He did get the ""discounted third read"" offer the BL sends out when someone complains about getting disparate scores.  No one knows how often* that happens, but it is a recurring theme in posts by former BL users: the inconsistency of the ratings.  Mr. Lowell seems to think his experiment means everyone should be posting to the Black List:  Bottom line first: if I were breaking in, the Blacklist would be a no-brainer to try.  Let's rewind here and look at this not from the perspective of an experienced industry professional, but from the POV of the nascent screenwriter without much money.  Let's posit they submit the same script Mr. Lowell did.  But they only buy one read.  And they get back a 6.  9 or 6 is a coinflip in this case.  And quite possibly the difference between success and failure.  What is the sincere and determined screenwriter  going to do?  Rewrite what is, I am sure, a wonderfully written script into ... something decidedly less wonderful.  They have little choice if they want to use the BL unless they are prepared to experiment with their money and buy several more reads and try to luck into an 8 or 9.     Because, without that high score, they will pay month after month for the BL to host a script that no one is going to look at.  You have to get the score.  So they rewrite because they are new and unsure and someone on a forum told them it was the way to go, resubmit and get - a 5!   But there was nothing wrong with the script in the first place.  How badly mangled will it be if they rewrite again?   Mr. Lowell's experiment seems to this blogger to only confirm what so many already know: the BL might be a fine venue for insiders and pros, but for the inexperienced writer, it's a Black Hole."

So let's see, you can't really sell (through your sycophant) that I had a bad experience with a script on the BL, or that I'm just a nasty racist, so now you want everyone to think I'm as smarmy a spin doctor as you.   Thing is, if I was all those things, it wouldn't change anything about  the OP being right on.   The Black List is purposely designed to conflate the annual list of popular scripts with the hosting site.  The first $25 is a worthless to the writer giveaway.  There is no way to verify how any script gets on the annual Black List.  No objective evidence that any significant number of ""industry insiders"" pays much if any attention to the Black List site.

Screenwriting,38pr4a,captainfalcon311,6,Sat Jun 6 14:04:51 2015 UTC,"Let's see:   Your link said that it was to Jeff Lowell's Black List Experiment. You could have linked to Jeff's chronicle of his experiment in his own words (as I did). Instead, you linked to your blog and thoughts on his experiment, which is - like I said - false pretenses.  And again, wrapped in the anonymity cloak of reddit and your blog, you're right, it's impossible to know if you've had a bad experience with a script on the BL, if you're just a nasty racist, or if your a smarmy spin doctor, or you're all three.  And no, it wouldn't change anything about the facts of the OP's post, but it would change the extent to which people would take your word for anything since you speak in opinions and assertions, not facts building toward an argument.  As for the Black List branding, the use of ""the Black List"" as a brand is designed to expand the nature of what we do beyond the annual list, just as the Sundance Labs, Sundance channel, Sundance Institute, etc. expand the brand of the Sundance Film Festival. We explain, in depth and openly, the difference between the annual list and the website, just Sundance differentiates between their programs, though they all remain under the same brand umbrella.  Scripts get on the annual Black List the same way they have since the beginning, a vote of development executives in the film industry. Originally it was 93; it has since expanded to every executive at a major studio, major film financier, or production company who has a deal therewith.  The objective evidence that any significant number of ""industry insiders"" pays much if any attention to the Black List site is the number of writers - well over a hundred at this point - who have been signed at major agencies and management companies, the number of writers who have ended up on the annual list, the number of writers who now have deals at major studios, our official partnerships with major studios, festivals, producers, etc.  As for my career, I'm more than happy to out myself:  I helped run a congressional campaign for six months out of college. 1st district of Ohio. Candidate's name was John Cranley. He's now the mayor of Cincinnati. After that, I wrote for the Guardian newspapers in Trinidad (my grandfather is from there) for a few months to decompress. I then took a business analyst job at McKinsey & Company in New York City. When my entire analyst class was laid off with five months severance, I moved to Los Angeles.  My Hollywood career has gone like this:  Assistant at CAA for a year. John Goldwyn Productions as a junior executive for six months when I was offered a job at Leonardo DiCaprio's company Appian Way working as executive to Brad Simpson (formerly of Killer Films, now of Color Force). I was there for 2.5 years when, yes, I was let go. 3 weeks later I was running LA based development for Sydney Pollack and Anthony Minghella's company, Mirage Enterprises. I did that for a year, but tragically, both Sydney and Anthony fell seriously ill and died. I was offered and took a job at Universal Pictures, where I worked for two years. I was then offered a job as a VP of Creative Affairs at Overbrook Entertainment (Will Smith's company), where I worked for two years before it became clear that it wasn't a place I should stay and my contract ended, and I decided to go full time on the Black List.   So not holding down a job in Hollywood has never been my problem. The problem has been finding a job that was consistent with my worldview and wherein I actually believed that writers got the respect they deserved. I had it with Sydney and Anthony, but they both passed well before their time.  So yeah, I created one, and our work has benefited hundreds if not thousands of writers already, and I'm enormously proud of that."

My personal opinion is that things are still the way the've been in terms of breaking in. I truly believe the best way is to move to LA, work on your craft, meet other people who are grinding, and become friends with them.  I think the problem lies with people who think they can circumvent the system and have The Blacklist do the work for them. These are the people who are disappointed the most, and usually the ones who question the validity of the site more frequently.  But you know, it doesn't hurt to have some coverage provided either.

If 99% of the scripts that make their way through any given literary agency are given strong passes, what makes you think the Black List would have better odds? Just because you're paying for it? If anything, that would mean MORE than 99% of the scripts would be passes as anyone who pays can submit to the Black List.   The Black List site isn't a place for you to test the waters with the second draft of your very first screenplay. Industry pros who use the site aren't looking for ""okay"" scripts, they're looking for triple-A scripts with the potential to gross a hundred million at the box office, or a script that's going to win a few Oscars.

Screenwriting is hard, screenwriting within the studio system requires a shitton of non-writing skills.  Have you ever heard the story of how ""Waterworld"" was re-written during production?  They put Joss Whedon in a hotel room.  Every day (while filming was going on) the producer would arrive in the morning and tell Whedon what to write.  In the early afternoon, the director would arrive, tell Whedon to disregard the producer’s notes, and write what the director wanted.  Then, in the evening, Kevin Costner would visit, tell Whedon to throw out everything he did with the producer and director, and write what Costner wanted.  Obviously not all studio movies are that much of a clusterfuck.  But you have no idea what went on behind the scenes of a movie, and how difficult it can be to churn out something good when you have directors, producers, stars, executives – all of them cooks in the kitchen, all of them more powerful than you.

Or are you saying that Skip Woods is actually a brilliant screenwriter, superior to the unproduced ones here and on the Blacklist, and he's just hampered by bad luck (despite working with different sets of directors, producers, and stars)?  It's an interesting idea that studios would rather work with a mediocre but consistent writer than a talented writer without proven non-writing skills, but if that's the case there should be more discussion of those skills here, rather than this narrative that you are the total of your work, and the perfect script will be its own ticket."

Our partnerships with Warner Bros, Disney, Cassian Elwes, the National Football League, StudioCanal and the Picture Company, the Sundance Film Festival, the Toronto Film Festival, etc. etc.  Our transparency The quality of our evaluations Our customer service (even when the evaluations indicate problems) Our technology Our industry professional community over 3000 strong ranging from agency assistants to studio presidents, working actors, and working directors. Results: the number of writers from all over the world who have found representation, sold their scripts, been offered blind script deals, and seen their movies go into production because of introductions made via the Black List website.

The 99% that fail are always going to be salty, no matter what. But the Blacklist is a good thing in that it does offer that 1% chance that you'll get the one magic read you need to succeed. And it more or less levels the playing field so that the writing can speak for itself. It's a significantly better alternative to blind queries (which, as a former reader, I can tell you - no one likes receiving blind queries). Bottom line is, hypothetically, if three months of hosting and a couple reviews were to get you the break you've been looking for, would you still be complaining about the price? No. There's a degree of financial risk involved for everyone. But the potential payoff is great. If you're not willing to take the risk, then don't use the service. Simple as. There's really no point to bemoaning the fact that only the upper echelon see results. Stop doing that and spend the time working on your craft. Besides, I've bought one blcklst review so far, and while it wasn't the score I was hoping for, I found the coverage immensely helpful.

But at the same time, I don't know how it could be better.    The issue is subjectivity.  One person's genius script is another person's piece of shit.  Plus the way script readers look at your body of work is completely different than how a movie goer would look at it.  I'm a musician and when you become a musician you start to look at music differently whether you want to or not.  Suddenly complexity and what goes on behind the sounds start to matter.  I feel that's the same way with script readers, what they perceive as good seems to be vastly different from what most movie goers see as good.  Not only that, but you're handing over your first born to evaluators that may not have a creative bone in their body, or you don't even know if they like your type of script.

I think the Blacklist site would make a killing if it were exclusively used by writers with exceptional material. Almost every production company, etc. would try to find writers there. They might even pay money for it, and excellent-yet-not-constantly-working writers (of which there are many) certainly should pay a much higher rate than now to have their work found there without all the hustling usually required.  The problem is many mediocre writers think they're exceptional, and they can say ""take my word for it, I'm great"" just as well as the ones who actually are great. Maybe better, because the best writers often focus on their own weaknesses (which is one quality which helps many people become better at writing). So the Blacklist asks people to put their money where their mouth is, and for a small fee readers will try to filter if the scripts really are that good.  I'd love to hear /u/franklinleonard's take on this, but I bet he'd be thrilled if there were a button he could press and only exceptional material would be posted on TBL, and it would always stay that way even after word got out that people there were getting jobs much easier (which I'm ~certain they would)."

Should it be an 8? Multiple 8s? What about polarizing scripts?   The reality is that there are scripts that receive high scores of 6 overall that get multiple downloads. Who are we to tell them that they don't have the right to make their script available to our industry professional members?  It's a far, far better approach to be highly transparent to the writer about the traffic (if any) that their scripts are receiving and let them decide how they want to approach things, which is what we do.

I'll say it straight out: We strongly advise people who upload scripts to buy at least one evaluation. We don't require it, because if people want to be creative about using their hosting on the site to attract attention, fair play.   But seriously, if someone wants to get maximum value for the site without doing any additional work on their own to attract attention to their script, they should absolutely think of it as a minimum $75 charge ($25 for one month of hosting and $50 for one evaluation.)"

The number of people paying $25 mo. That shouldn't be is probably quite large. Requiring a minimum score (say a 5 or 6) to be listed would go a long way to reducing the ick factor and improving the value to both sides of your constituency.   As an example, most reputable art schools do a ""freshmen review"". Faculty sit down with students who realistically aren't going to make it and cut them lose. Subjective? Sure. Harsh? Absolutely.

You pay for hosting and evaluations, yes - because those things aren't free - and real industry people will read it if your script is good. That makes it different from every other seemingly similar service. Agencies and production companies have people watching the Black List. They don't as a rule have people watching the other services, no matter what the other services claim.  If your script isn't good, well, no. It won't get received well, and industry folks won't read it. And nothing's changed in that case.  Just because some of the same people are using the BL who are using some of the (many) scam services doesn't make the BL the same.  Just out of curiosity, what better system might you propose, in a perfect world?"

My last word is this: I haven't heard Scoggins ever diss anyone or their site. He may have and I didn't hear it, but Franklin constantly puts down Scoggins site and anyone who questions him, gets attacked personally.

Screenwriting,38pr4a,punkmuppet,-6,Wed Jun 10 03:29:42 2015 UTC,"it's very clear that this is a business model built atop the backs of losers.    Right.  I've been 'round and 'round with Leonard on this on two forums. Used to be no one dared utter a word against it. People are starting to catch on.   IMO, if he wants a real straightforward deal, he can offer actual coverage services (which he does not, by his own testimony) and then, after people have scripts that are rated well, they can pay to host them. If he did that, I'd have multiple scripts on there. Especially if he had a reasonable fee structure - like a yearly membership for around $15/mo.   He has conflated his original Black List - which is not a list of unrepresented spec scripts - and his hosting site so that people reasonably think it's some kind of contest to get on the annual list.    This is no accident. When Jason Scoggins started Spec Scout, he didn't call it The Scoggins Report.  That all being said, IF you have a very good script, it's been vetted and is of industry standard, The Blacklist isn't the worst idea, necessarily."
Screenwriting,38pr4a,punkmuppet,8,Fri Jun 5 20:47:34 2015 UTC,Here we go again... This time I'll try to keep it brief.  Simple questions:   How many writers have been signed from Spec Scout?  How many have sold their scripts or been offered deals because of Spec Scout?  How many have seen their films produced because of Spec Scout?  I'll let the Black List's record speak for itself.
Screenwriting,38pr4a,franklinleonard,-1,Fri Jun 5 22:28:38 2015 UTC,"How many writers have been signed from Spec Scout?  How many have sold their scripts or been offered deals because of Spec Scout?  How many have seen their films produced because of Spec Scout?   Info on the site about successes is available to all. NOT doing a commercial for SS. FL. Just pointing out that the statement that only the Black List has industry professionals accessing the site is at best an egregious error and at worst a lie.  So how about this:   IMO, if he wants a real straightforward deal, he can offer actual coverage services (which he does not, by his own testimony) and then, after people have scripts that are rated well, they can pay to host them.

Here are their success stories: http://www.specscout.com/screenwriters/#successStories  I encourage everyone to comparison shop between theirs and ours.  As for whether the Black List is the only site that has industry professionals accessing the site, it definitely isn't, but there's a wide gulf between the folks who are accessing SpecScout and Inktip and those accessing the Black List. Like I said, there's a reason we have the partnerships we do with the Guilds, the studios, the festivals, the producers, and even the NFL, and they don't.  Lastly, the price would be higher to offer complete ""coverage"" from the caliber of readers we have.   We're happy to continue on with the happy medium between low cost (which it is, btw, compared to any service on the market that can provide even 10% of what we provide) and a high value service.

Screenwriting,38pr4a,Wearedondraper,0,Sat Jun 6 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think $50 is too much for an evaluation. Considering the time it takes to read a screenplay and give a thoughtful response, that's barely minimum wage in California.  The $25 hosting fee seems a bit excessive though. I'm sure Franklin Leonard has the stats, but I'm guess less than 5% of scripts get a pro download unless they've first gotten an evaluation. It seems that hosting alone rarely gets you anywhere.   Personally, I'd prefer to see a business model where the $50 evaluation also gets you one free month of hosting, and perhaps hosting alone is only maybe $5 a month. At the cost of $25 a month, I think a lot of people have higher expectations of what hosting alone will get them. A more reasonable $5 a month might temper those expectations."
Screenwriting,38pr4a,wrytagain,3,Fri Jun 5 21:49:54 2015 UTC,"$50 would be an incredible price for thorough notes. From the samples I've seen, that's not what you get, though."

Screenwriting,38pr4a,franklinleonard,0,Sat Jun 6 05:36:15 2015 UTC,"75$ guarantees only that a reader will skim your script and then write a review that makes it difficult to prove that they did so. If it actually guaranteed a full, considered read then it would be worth it."

Screenwriting,38pr4a,franklinleonard,0,Sat Jun 6 16:30:01 2015 UTC,"I don't see the point of that. Ultimately I accept that this kind of script is not going to be something that has universal appeal. I say this as someone who scored an 8 on a previous script followed by a 6 from the next review. (The free reviews following an 8 were not offered at that stage). I had the distinct feeling that the person giving the six did not read the script closely.   I took on board feedback from those, and uploaded a fresh draft, recieved a 7 and at this point felt compelled to give up the process.   I can't help but echo the sentiment of the blogger above that for us non-pros it's a crapshoot. Was that 8 pure luck? What if my first score was a six? Obviously the blacklist process (and perhaps Hollywood in general) seems geared towards broad appeal and this plays against more complex and challenging material, especially when coming from unknown writers. (What if your script is written so that the only way to truly get it fully is to read it more than once? Do such stories have a place when the pay is barely minimum wage for a quick read as is? )  My latest script, which I would argue showed greater craftsmanship (learning and getting better from doing more work etc) received a 4 and 5. And I was left feeling that both reviewers took offence to the material and skimmed as a result. And in some ways this did not surprise me because that's the nature of the beast and an honest approach to some subjects is just too off putting for many people - and when it comes to script readers, once you get their backs up, then there's really no where to go. One reader did in fact make clear their objection to the nature of the material as overly sensationalist, which was a real gut punch because I had taken great pains to approach it quite deliberately so that it would not be so. In that context it can be argued that even the skimming was useful, because it made clear in no uncertain terms that people's level of prejudice is far greater and therefore their threshold for offence when it comes to certain subjects is far lower than I had realised.  Perhaps a greater discussion is required on the nature of putting aside subjective feelings when required to assess material objectively. I can't help but conclude that when the pay is low and the way to earn is through volume that a natural tendency to skim is almost inevitable. ( After all, we might buy a book or a cinema ticket and put it aside or walk out if it doesn't grab or indeed offends us. And when there are dozens or hundreds of scripts to read and the pay is scant, well then human nature must take over...)  Getting people fired won't change that. Neither will getting free reviews, because the next person might skim anyway.  The only way to ensure that they don't is if there was a synopsis, because they can't skim then as it will be easy to prove that they did.  I'd rather pay a 100$ and know for sure that the script was given a fair read and the reader took their time with it."

Screenwriting,38q4vj,BradleyX,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:35:26 2015 UTC,Typically your character starts one place and ends up another (both physically and emotionally). Outlining the beats that get the character from point A to point B give you the road map for that character's development inside the overall story and plot.   If you want a character to make a great sacrifice at the end of your film you have to show the process the character goes through to make that choice. You can't start with them willing to make it and you can't have them make it for no reason. You need to map it out.   Han Solo starts the movie Star Wars as a smuggler only looking out for himself. By the end he returns at great personal risk to help the rebels defeat the Death Star... what changed? When? And how? Those questions are answered in the character beat outline for Han Solo.   You should do this generally for any character that impacts the story or the plot of the film.
Screenwriting,38q4vj,devolka,0,Mon Jun 8 01:34:09 2015 UTC,Like scenes/events that illustrate:   character starts out wanting something    is too passive to get what he wants  watches others succeed and is frustrated  has a big thing happen that makes him have to take charge  then he does  gets what he wants and   becomes so much more dynamic and confident a beautiful woman takes him to bed

Then there an internal outline. This is everything under the surface. What are their deepest desires, what is holing them back, what would they do in certain situations Ex) if they got in a fight.

Screenwriting,38qgf8,Pressreturn1,2,Fri Jun 5 23:20:06 2015 UTC,"Okay, first the positives, which I think are most important - there's a really interesting premise here. Setting a horror story in the Greek Orthodoxy isn't something I've seen before, so immediately you have an advantage. I think that this screenplay is working on a larger scale, but I have a lot of issues with what's actually on the page. I'm not going to go easy on you, but that's only because I think there's potential here.  The biggest issues I have with your entire script can be demonstrated in one of the first paragraphs of action:  Behind the iconostasis, TWO orchestrate the altar calmly, like chemists in a lab. Instead of lab coats, they are adorned with vestments of gold and white with crucifixes intricately stitched onto the backs. They prepare the Holy Communion with acolytes standing by and painted saints all around and looking down.  Not many people know what things like apses or iconostases are. I certainly didn't. The point is that a few lines into your first page, I had to stop reading and look up two definitions. Please don't make me stop reading, especially so early on your first page. If the apse or the iconostasis is really important (if I need to know the geography of the setting for later) tell me in a few words what it is.  ""Behind the iconostasis"" I've never been in any kind of Eastern Orthodox or Greek Orthodox Cathedral, so I have no idea where that would actually be.  'TWO orchestrate' Okay, two WHAT, exactly?  The 'chemists in a lab' simile is really odd. Write with clarity in mind for your actors. If you mean to say they're carefully and calmly performing a ritual they've done a thousand times, then say that.  To summarize, and this applies to the entire screenplay: my biggest issues were overwriting and a lack of clarity. Now let's get into more specifics.  Pg. 1 - This is such a strange trend, but so many screenplays I read here start with a description of light. Sunlight, moonlight, lamplight, whatever. This boggles the %!&*ing mind. The image you're describing is of an ALTAR. Mention it first.  Pg. 2 - Character descriptions are bizarrely inconsistent. Joseph gets one descriptor - bushy red-brown beard. That's not enough. Give me age, clothing... a sense of who the guy is in less than ten words. Mia gets even less. No age, no visual description. Faye, however, gets a description that is WAY overblown. She’ll be beautiful soon, and her parents insist to her that she already is, but with her crooked, loose tooth and her tatterdemalion hair (which bounced behind her as she ran), she doesn’t believe it yet. Fine for a novel, but that's crazypants for a screenplay. You can't expect a seven-year-old to actually play that. Also, tatterdemalion hair? Tattered and dilapidated hair? Not only is that purple, it just doesn't make any sense.  Again, more words I'm having to stop and look up. Manoualia, papal fanon...  When we cut to the softball field, give me some description before getting into the dialogue. You know a good director would want an establishing shot of the field. If Mia's wearing her softball uniform, tell me. Paint me a picture.  Pg. 5 - '...her water bottle is near empty.' Unless it's a crucial detail that's important for the audience to know, don't give me close-ups like this.  The dialogue between Joseph and Mia on Page 5... nobody talks like this. How would Mia guess what he wants to say unless he's said it a thousand times?  ""In the rearview mirror, Joseph looks at the girl. She unknowingly makes him smile wide."" Overwritten and lacking in clarity. Could be: ""Joseph glances in the REARVIEW MIRROR to see FAYE's reflection... he smiles wide.""  Joseph 'potatoes' in his recliner? That's cute, but again, it lacks clarity.  This dialogue on Page 6 is a mystery, and not in a good way.  Pg 8. 'Curls into a fetal.' A know you mean the fetal position, but come on.  FADE IN and FADE OUT are typically only used at the beginning and end of a screenplay, respectively. I would use FADE TO BLACK and FADE UP ON. Also, if the light goes out in the bedroom, and we're left in the dark hallway, do you want a slow fade, or a CUT TO BLACK?  EXT. HOME is not descriptive enough. Whose home? Try EXT. ABRAMSOHN HOME, and keep it the same every time. On pg 2 you refer to ABRAMSOHNS' FRONT YARD and then ABRAMSOHN'S HOME. Keep the apostrophes and naming consistent.  Rickety playground? Would Joseph and Mia let Faye play on a swingset that was literally falling apart?  Pg 10. ""Joseph stands in front of a workbench. There are tools spread out around him. His back faces us, and he block whatever it is he is working on. We hear the rhythm of his woodworking."" There's a lack of economy here. Could be ""Joseph, his back to us, stands at his WORKBENCH. He's making something... TOOLS all around.""  Pg 10. ""We see"" is okay, but there are times when it's just verbal chaff. ""We see that the girl sleeps soundly."" How about ""FAYE sleeps soundly""? ""We see Faye's door. We see the lanky figure..."" How about this: ""FAYE'S DOOR in the foreground... at the far end of the hallway, a LANKY FIGURE silently ascends the steps...""   You're not really providing many details about THE FIGURE, so I assume its face is obscured or always out of frame. Maybe it's out of focus. Give us specifics on how you're going to keep it hidden. CLARITY!  Pg. 11 - INT. WARD - Uh, where's this? What ward, where?  Pg. 11 - ""We see him blink for the first time."" For the first time in eleven pages?  Pg. 13 -  ""Now we can see the color of the long rug and the color of the hardwood floor that it covers. We can see that the walls are brown, tea chest brown specifically."" You should have established the hallway when we first saw it. Also, tea chest brown specifically? I ask myself, ""how brown IS a tea chest, exactly?"" The mind reels.  Pg. 16 - Imagine the humiliation of the asian day player who has to read lines written in a stereotypical Chinese accent. This is BAD. If it was for comedic effect, maybe I'd understand why you wrote it this way, but even then it'd still come off as racist.  There are inconsistencies everywhere. Joseph calls Faye 'Faith' on pg 60. The same settings are named differently from scene to scene.  Okay, that's enough nit-picking. The bottom line is that I think it needs a BIG re-write for errors, consistency, clarity, and verbal economy, but also to reach a proper length (what's your ideal running time? Try to match it in page number). After that, I'd say start focusing on story structure, pacing, and how the whole vampire conceit is presented to the audience. It's revealed in a really odd way on Page 4 (""what the hell is this guy talking about?""), and you're hiding it in the logline. If this is a movie about vampires, there's no need to leave it out of your logline."
Screenwriting,38qgf8,thetravisnewton,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:01:19 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks for that. Most of it is very helpful.  I am grateful for the specifics. With this being my first script, I am eager to keep learning what I can do on the page and what I can't.  I will say, the pacing and ambiguities are intentional. It's not supposed to be a film about vampires it's about my character. What the vampires mean to him and how they effect him are all congruent with the pains of loss he will experience.  I am very interested in what you think further in, especially in terms of character and theme."
Screenwriting,38qgf8,thetravisnewton,2,Sat Jun 6 19:08:29 2015 UTC,"I am eager to keep learning what I can do on the page and what I can't.   I'm glad you're eager to learn. Heck, I'm a learner myself. We all are. But this isn't really about can and can't. You can do anything you want. It's more about should and shouldn't. There aren't many rules, just ways of doing things that will help your screenplay read like the movie it could become. Ways to make things easier for the people who could hypothetically make this movie.   I will say, the pacing and ambiguities are intentional.   Of course they are, but that doesn't mean they couldn't be adjusted for the benefit of the audience.   It's not supposed to be a film about vampires it's about my character.   Yes, the core story is a dark character drama about a man struggling with faith, loss, and guilt. But don't downplay the genre elements of your story. It's either a vampire movie or it isn't.  If it's an arthouse horror with vampires, that's cool. I'm writing an arthouse-y horror myself. You have to understand, though, that if you start showing this to people, they're gonna try to place it in an easy category. Vampires, werewolves, demons, whatever. Don't correct readers on that. It's just how they understand horror cinema.  That being said, yeah, I can give you notes on theme and character, but I'd rather wait until you can get me a revised draft. There are just too many little things in this draft that I'm having trouble overlooking. Can't see the forest through the trees, as it were.  Another note - Henry appears for the first time on pg 37, with no introduction. Zip, zero, nada."
Screenwriting,38qgf8,thetravisnewton,2,Sat Jun 6 19:54:31 2015 UTC,"That is his introduction. ^ Do you see a problem with introducing his character so late?  Another thing, in my mind, I just don't see it as all encompassing to label this as just a vampire movie. It's more than that. Although one would not be wrong to call it that, it doesn't represent my script fairly I don't think. But like the customer, the audience is always right, I guess.  Let me revise it with the great suggestions I have.   Another thing: How far have you made it?"
Screenwriting,38qgf8,thetravisnewton,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:40:14 2015 UTC,"Regarding Henry's intro on page 37 — My issue with his introduction is that there's no description. How old is he? What does he look like? What kind of vibe is he putting out?  You can introduce characters whenever you see fit. What jumps out as odd to me is that we get a short flashback to establish some kind of interaction with Joseph only a few pages after he's introduced. It's as if you realized this new character would need some establishing, but you hadn't put any thought into it earlier... simply because you hadn't thought of him earlier. Of course I could be wrong, maybe you intended this from the get-go. But keep in mind that earlier setups, even subtle ones, can create more rewarding payoffs. If he's a member of Joseph's congregation, it might be better to introduce him briefly during the service on page 2 or 3, even if it's just giving him a close-up. Maybe that flashback belongs earlier in the film, and not as a flashback. Just a few ideas.  Where am I? Right now I'd say page forty reading it word-for-word, but I've also skimmed the whole thing and jumped around in the screenplay based on things I've found. I noticed the word ""Faith"" instead of ""Faye"" and thought, ""I bet he changed the character's name and didn't go through the whole script."" So I searched for ""Faith"", and sure enough I saw it again. I did the same thing when I saw Henry introduced with no description. I thought, ""hold on, did I miss something? Who is this guy?""  And now the same thing with the dog on page forty. You don't give it much of an introduction. The paragraph reads as if the dog was introduced earlier."

To continue the use of Walter White as an example...it's very clear almost from episode 1 that what Walter ""becomes"" has always been bottled-up inside him. All that happened was that circumstances changed (catalyst), and he uncorked."

It helps me to think characters always had a part of that change in them, and are just letting their true selves out.

Then he encounters a pathetic homeless guy and, disgusted by his appearance, hurries by without giving him a thing.  He can be cold and callous.

You keep the action up, which is nice to see. Usually I get bored reading these things, but it kept me interested. But what it's missing is the bigger picture. As in, where's it going? Since it's only half done, I imagine that it will build up and reveal more of itself.       The plot is interesting and I do want to keep reading, but maybe it'll come off as too generic. All the characters are just kinda junkies, and we're more pulled along by the plot.

It's just that when the story began they were in a dry period, where they were pressed for cash and thus unable to satisfy their addiction, resorting to drastic measures.  I'll post the rest sometime next week, and hopefully close gaps. As for the characters, I assumed they'd initially come off as bland, but as the story progresses, hopefully get deeper and deeper, as they all go through their own sub-plots doing crazy/immoral things for a quick buck.  edit: soldier field is the Chicago Bear's stadium"

Screenwriting,38n1h2,thetravisnewton,3,Sat Jun 6 04:28:12 2015 UTC,"Hey, congrats on a completed first draft. I think you exercise great verbal economy, you have a clear voice, and (for the most part) your action has wonderful clarity. This is an eighties-nineties horror throwback that knows exactly what its tone is. Let's get into it.  Give me a sense of the town in the first few pages. I need to know how small and remote it is. I feel like I'm missing some establishing shots here.  Pg. 5 - ""The whole office is clustered to hell and back"". Not sure if you mean ""cluttered"".  Pg. 5 - you say ""to hell and back"" twice on the same page. Gimme more variety.  Pg. 6 - When you first describe DESMOND, you might want to mention he's a doctor. Use costumes and props to tell us who people are - maybe he has a stethoscope around his neck. Same with Jenna, Erin, Cristine, Shane. Give us a sense of what they do other than talk, make out, and smoke weed. You can outright tell me their jobs, and it'll help me understand what they look like and how they present. Right now they just seem like slasher fodder.  Room 237 — I see what you did there.  Pg. 13 - I'm only now starting to get a sense of where this takes place. Large trees and ditches... doesn't sound like a city.  Pg. 16 - Johnny Hall sounds like the Ken Foree character in a Rob Zombie movie. You can cut his description down, though. ""JOHNNY HALL (late 50s), is tall, black, bald, and muscular. Wears a Janitor's uniform.""  Pg. 17 - Awning, not oning.  Pg. 32 - Christine would not refer to Desmond as 'Desmond' in front of a visitor in the hospital. ""Dr. Barker.""  Pg. 37 - The power going out in the hospital is a big moment - maybe give it the all caps treatment, and maybe cut to other characters inside to get their reactions.  Laura is referenced seven times in the screenplay, but is never explained. You don't need to name her if she never has any dialogue. You could replace her name with 'dispatch' or 'the station' and it would make more sense. ""If for some reason things go south I need you to call dispatch and get everyone down here.""  Pg. 43 - I'm not sure why everyone is freaking out. There's a gravely injured guy, and this is a hospital. They should be equipped to deal with it physically and emotionally. Someone would call a code over the intercom, and the proper staff would be there ASAP for triage. I'd give the script to someone who works or has worked in a hospital and see where your inaccuracies are. Maybe head over to r/writeresearch. I'm not saying it has to be 100% accurate, but the little things you get right will aid in the audience's suspension of disbelief.  Pg. 47 - Breath is the noun, breathe is the verb. Common mistake.  Pg. 48 - Uh, why wouldn't Desmond just use medical restraints to tie the old man down? And why are they restraining him? Why do they think he's dangerous? I'm not sure why they're suspicious of him. We as the audience are suspicious of him, but to the staff he's just a patient who needs emergency care. Also, a doctor wouldn't be the one doing this. These are the duties of a nurse/orderly. Also, Shannon and The Old Man wouldn't be put in rooms until they were stabilized. They'd most likely spend the night in the ICU - a long room where beds are separated by privacy curtains.  Pg. 50 - Johnny shouldn't have to pull a gun to break up that fight. That's a weird overreaction.  Pg. 51 - It's a trope in movies and TV when dialogue scenes happen outside in the pouring rain without cover. Sure, it looks cool on camera, but who does this? Maybe give the THREE MEN heavy raincoats or something.  Pg. 53 - Though it's mentioned by Adrian earlier, we are finally introduced to THE GIRL as SHANNON. I think you're better off revealing her name to us on page 1. It's okay if the characters don't know her name until later, but it would help with clarity for the reader.  Pg. 53 - Glass jar full of morphine? Not sure what you mean. There wouldn't be a glass jar full of morphine on her IV stand. Here's what a contemporary morphine drip looks like. If she was heavily dosed on morphine, she wouldn't be able to get around so easily. Maybe her morphine drip malfunctions, the staff is too busy to notice and she wakes up in pain... oh, and she'd notice all those cuts immediately when she moved. She'd feel every one. Maybe she pushes the NURSE CALL button to no effect then wanders out. Again, it's little touches of realism that can help.  Okay, I'm gonna stop here, but the biggest thing this script needs is a reality check - a sense of how a hospital (even a small one) and its staff would function. Like I said earlier, you don't need 100% accuracy, but when you push the boundaries of plausibility, you will lose people. The details matter. I think you can up the realism without losing the fun throwback tone and structure of your narrative. I think that's your biggest hurdle to overcome. The way you put words on the page is damn good. There aren't a whole lot of wasted words here, and that works in your favor tremendously."
Screenwriting,38n1h2,floppylobster,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:51:12 2015 UTC,"Hi,  I got five pages in, (don't take that personally I have no attention span).   My comment is that when I got to the character of Richard I couldn't tell if he was written against type - which made him incredibly interesting. Or way over-written - which would have been a bad sign of things to come.   If he talks this way all the time I'll definitely keep reading, but there was no indication in the script that the other character was reacting to the unusual way he was obsessing over the book so I left it at that.  So to sum up, if Richard is a humorous character, then add a little more indication in the script so I know you're in on the joke and trust where it's heading. If he's supposed to be serious, then tone down his dialogue as he seems to talk too much without prompting.   EDIT: And before I read anymore, my suggestion: I'd love to see you write this character of Richard in the style of Jack from Big Trouble in Little China. He'd make a nice contrast for other 'grittier' characters and whatever horror it is that comes later. That's just based off reading the first five pages though."

This runs at odds with his lifestyle as a violent mob boss.  His character journey is rife with contradiction as he seeks to rid his psychological burdens while ignoring the psychological traumas and stress he's exposed to by virtue of his profession.  Hamlet:  He wants to avenge his father's death.  This is at odds with his erratic behavior and his often pedantic behavior.  His contradiction is he wants to kill his uncle but he lacks the conviction and cold-blooded traits of a murderer.  His character is revealed to be an impotent warrior unable to indulge his desire for revenge.  Elliot Spitzer (Specifically his portrayal in Client 9):  He wants to clean up Wall Street, be the ethical politician the people need.  This is at odds with his sense of entitlement and belief he was untouchable.  His contradiction is that he is a crusader against unethical liars while he himself is lying to his wife and breaking the law.  Looking back on these, they're super simplified ways of looking at characters that exemplify elements of irony, hubris and dramatic irony.

Screenwriting,38mhtk,Asiriya,3,Fri Jun 5 14:09:31 2015 UTC,"that can be useful. you can also imply these things via speech. for example, if someone has an unhealthy internet addiction, you can have one character (maybe pissed off girlfriend who needs more love and attention) make a remark or hurl some insult about the guy who spends too long online.   i've also experimented in using flashback sequences to imply certain responses. for example, one of my characters is a hospital warden and gets emotionally involved with a patient. i wanted to imply empathy, care, pity and worry. the patient is in bad shape; the looks of his 'yellowing, veiny' legs reminds the warden of his grandmother, sending him into a flashback of his grandmother lying on her deathbed. malnourished, her legs look exactly the same. the warden is a young boy, watching his grandmother crying, asking why she's being 'kept alive' while she's lonely, has no friends, going deaf and blind and can no longer read etc. and the warden (child) is just wishing he could help her, but his parents lead him away. this is one of a few fundamental aspects of how he comes to care for and be emotionally involved with the patient."
Screenwriting,38mhtk,adenanomie,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:07:11 2015 UTC,"I'm beginning to feel a little more aggressive against blatant exposition like that. I'd probably go for something different, his grandfather's watch which he wears every day, we see the care he gives it (worry when he can't find it in the morning). Later when he sees the patient he has a tic that makes him rub it. Back at his house we linger on a picture of the grandfather with the watch. Or something.  But leave it as a mini mystery and let the director work out how to express it.   empathy, care, pity and worry   If that doesn't work (it would be harder to have an artifact that his grandmother would have worn and he's happy to as well) I still think there are other ways to show this. Show that he's talked to the patient before by launching into a question he's had stored up. Show that his grandmother is on his mind by referencing her. Bring in a gift that the patient has been wanting (think Dexter's search for the perfect key lime pie), or a bit of news he knows she'd be interested in.  That's just me. Obviously we all have flashbacks to things, but from a visual point of view I don't like them, the director is too likely to emphasise it by adding stupid effects like blur around the screen edge. I think they risk breaking a scene by taking you out of the moment. Suddenly you're being forced into an artificial connection with the character while missing out on interesting development between two characters that are actually part of the story. In leaving the present you're damaging the story's pacing and momentum; in your situation you spend time establishing the past emotion, then have to convey it being applied to the patient (or else it's ambiguous, he could be remembering and dismissing it, completely the opposite of what you intend).  Anyway, just my opinion. Your way is more common, probably clearer, almost certainly easier to convey, I'm just not a fan. Blame GRRM / George Miller."

Take two characters, place them in a situation (lost in the woods, breaking into a house, becoming roommates) and just see where it goes.   Don't worry about page length, or writing skill, just really focus on who these people are and how they think. If they're lost in the woods does one of them break down in shock and fear. Does the other pull upon years of boy scout training and guide them to safety. You're looking for ways that show your characters are different.  By writing these scenes, they won't be usable, but the edges of their personality will start to come into focus."

Screenwriting,38j3ds,spicoli77,19,Thu Jun 4 15:38:09 2015 UTC,"I must admit, I'm confused. It appears some believe that screenplay evaluations should conform in some manner with each other. That's not only unrealistic, it's not even desirable.  Unlike Olympic diving (one example cited), screenplays do not have a formalized series of components each ranked by difficulty, nor are there set, clear standards of proper form for those (nonexistent) components.  Every reader will have a unique relationship with the words they read. That unique relationship is a product of both the script (constant across all readers) and the mood/taste/personality of the reader (wildly varying across people).  Good. You want that. And why? Because you're not looking for ""everyone's slurried opinions equal a 7."" You're looking for a champion who loves your script.  I've said this many times... you do not want to be a solid average. You want to be an outlier. If I were putting a script on the Black List, I would much rather have four 5's and one 10 than five 7's.  A range of 3 to 7 says one thing to me: no one LOVED the script. That's the only thing that matters. It's also very valuable information.  If you think a range of 3 to 7 is unacceptably diverse, just wait until you start hearing back from producers and executives. ""People disagree wildly"" is pretty much the standard setting for ALL work in Hollywood.  If you're craving the certainty of objectivity with an arithmetical mean, the screenwriting trade will sorely test you."

Franklin has stated that the category scores are rated just like the overall; It's just about how likely they'd be to recommend the material or element of the script to a peer or superior. Writers get can get jobs because the do something particularly well. In the case of my script with one reader, I scored an 8 in regards to plot and character. Sure, no one loved the script, but someone did LOVE particular elements of it."

At least that's what they did for me after receiving a 7-8 on one eval then a 2-3 on the next. My replacement eval was verbally glowing (everything I wanted to hear? wtf?) but numerically in the 5-6 range. That's when I realized I was being strung along since the words and the numerics didn't match up. I was just being glad-handed. There are so many other eval services that provide better service. Dont try to buy your way onto the yearly Blacklist by using their completely separate pay-to-play service.  It's a fool's gambit. Most of the Yearly Blacklist come from a list of Franklin Leonard's Hollywood cronies NOT from the pay for play eval site.There are high profile exceptions, but the majority of the yearly list (more than 90%) have never been on the pay for play part of the operation. If your script is truly a 9 it will find it way onto the Yearly Blacklist without paying for an evaluation. Use free peer evaluation before spending money like the OP (and I) did. Once your script is receiving consistent 8s and 9s through peer evaluation then maybe try the BL pay to pay but I've personally lost faith due to their wildly inconsistent returns as demonstrated by the OP. This is a pretty typical result for their eval service in my experience and is not particularly helpful."

And trust that we had a long talk with that reader.  And to be clear, the annual list isn't voted on by my ""Hollywood cronies."" It's voted on by more than 300 film executives at the major studios, major financiers, and production companies who have deals therewith.   10 scripts that have been discovered on the website have made the annual list in the last two years, including last year's #1 script, CATHERINE THE GREAT by Kristina Lauren Anderson."

Two rational people with decades of experience can disagree vehemently and frequently do. Our readers were selected because the knowledge and experience they do have working in concert with the system we’ve created is likely to efficiently identify the type of material worthy of an argument between those two rational people with decades of experience.
Screenwriting,38j3ds,AndySipherBull,6,Thu Jun 4 22:28:13 2015 UTC,"We handle polarizing scripts in a number of ways:   ANY script that receives a single 8 overall or better from one of our readers is included in the weekly email to our entire industry professional membership. That's true regardless of what other ratings of the script are. We have a recommendations algorithm (built by Sean Owen, current VP of data science at Cloudera) that recommends scripts to individual members based on their taste and everyone else's. Polarizing scripts are then recommended to the industry members who are most likely to like them. Scripts that receive consecutive overall ratings from our readers that differ by 3 or more overall points are offered an additional reading at a 50% discount so that we can gain additional information about the script to better recommend it to the folks who are likely to like it. Many of our biweekly featured scripts are some of the more polarizing scripts on the site (though typically they've received at least one overall score of 8 or better, thus indicating that at least one person feels passionately about the script.)"
Screenwriting,38j3ds,nitrohawk91,2,Fri Jun 5 06:01:37 2015 UTC,"Seems like the inefficiency lies in the use of one objective number to characterize two subjective elements:  quality (don't pretend a shitty, unmarketable script won't get a 2) and taste (don't pretend a potentially marketable script that a reader finds repugnant won't get a 2)."

Many are happy with it, and this post shows a variety of ratings which I would imagine are rare.   Sometimes I get the impression that aspiring screenwriters think that the Blcklst has some kind of responsibility to serve them. But it's a business.

Or Groundhog Day? All suffered from initial critical indifference or despite and are now considered timeless.  So there's a standard right?    As far as internalizing objective standards, I don't know, do you really think David Denby walks into Avengers AoU thinking ""Christ more of this shit.""?

I've never worked for the BL. I've gotten some coverage from them that I found disappointing (lots of praise, no substantive criticism: gave it a six). But I've also been on the other side of this sort of thing. And I will say this:  There is nothing that works for everyone. That's why I mentioned Mad Max. I literally don't understand how someone who likes action movies could not like that movie, but those people are out there.   I also think that there is more variance in middling scripts than there is in great or terrible ones. As someone who has worked as a reader (NOT for the BL) I think that readers tend to check out a little bit when a script isn't working for them, and, recognizing that there isn't much functional difference between a six and a three, make up for the extra work they put in on scripts they love by being a little less diligent on the scripts that don't work for them. They shouldn't do this, but talk to a dozen readers and they'll tell you that this is one of the battles they fight with themselves when they're on script #15 of the week.   Beyond that, this happens to everyone. I won the Nicholl, and afterwards met with a producer who was on the committee. The same committee that had, weeks earlier, voted to give me the award. Somebody with a HUGE name in the industry. And it was clear from our meeting that he didn't like the script at all. This is the same script that got me my first rep and my first job.   Or, here's a more famous example. Raiders of the Lost Ark. It was passed on by every studio except Paramount. In fact, they only went to Paramount because they had no other options left. In Black List terms, every studio gave it a 7 or lower except for Paramount, which gave it a 9.   There is a subjective component to every read you will ever get in Hollywood.

To be fair, this example wasn't about the script at all.  Spielberg and Lucas were driving a very hard bargain, including Lucas keeping the copyright and wanting to essentially ""rent"" the studio distribution system.  The fact that 1941 tanked (and was over schedule & budget) while they were shopping Raiders didn't help.  That doesn't make your point wrong, though.  There is a huge subjective variance in opinions about scripts.  That's one of the big lessons noobs have to learn.  There's no objective yardstick for ""perfect"" script.

So a really great screenplay with little commercial viability might score highly in terms of quality, but low overall. It's the same on the Annual Blacklist as well -- it's ""most liked"" not ""best,"" right? The site is more of a focus group of 'industry' people instead of, say, a source of quality critique.

Actually, especially if it's for one category.   Yeah, not everything is for everybody. Like Aaron Sorkin. Some like his style, some don't. But I think even those who don't like his style can appreciate that there's a quantifiable talent there, but the style just doesn't entertain them.

Screenwriting,38j3ds,franklinleonard,2,Thu Jun 4 22:53:41 2015 UTC,"Not at all pointless, because we're not just providing numerical scores. We're also providing qualitative feedback that gives insight into why the reader scored the script as they did which should inform if and how a writer wants to improve their script based on that advice.  And, yes, Sorkin should get a low score if the reader doesn't connect with his dialogue style, though I believe that the vast majority of readers of Aaron Sorkin's scripts DO connect to it, which would mean that the sum total of his scores would indicate something that most people respond to but some (a much smaller number) don't. And so it certainly means that if an individual reader didn't enjoy the script and they wouldn't recommend it to their peers or superiors in the industry,  they should score it low."

Additionally, those same obvious strengths may garner those involved additional meetings/writing assignments as plot, character and emotion do indeed jump off this page. Bottom line, this project needs minimal work to push it over the threshold assessed here."

It's the exact same principal that collectible card games and phone games operate on: just enough hope to continue paying with no certainty that you will get what you want. The fact that after a bad evaluation (which everyone gets) the owner of the company offers additional readings at a discount (something everyone also gets) points to a manipulative game system."
Screenwriting,38j3ds,SawyerOlson,7,Fri Jun 5 03:31:47 2015 UTC,"This actually isn't how it works.   Folks who receive an 8 or better overall are offered additional reads (for free) so that we can gather as much information as possible about the scripts that are strong enough to elicit a strong positive reaction from at least one reader.  If a script receives successive reads that differ by 3 or more points overall, they are offered an additional read at a 50% discount (read: no profit for us). The idea here is that this is a script that elicits polarizing reactions, and more data is valuable so that we can recommend it to people who are likely to like it."

Of course there is no ""no VO rule"", and even if there were, we all know that there are times to break the rules - but - a writer who's struggling to get read really needs to think twice before including something that will cause many to roll their eyes before even getting past page 1.

Screenwriting,38lvbn,Mura-Masa,4,Fri Jun 5 01:44:47 2015 UTC,"Your plan, as far as I can see, doesn't include college in any way. That is absolutely your right and I'm not here to tell you you have to do anything differently. There is absolutely a route to success, built entirely on relationships and strong writing samples, that leads to you reaching all of your goals.  However, your lack of college degree will make several other routes much less viable. I would say the same thing to someone who didn't have a laptop, or didn't know how to type, or didn't own a car. I don't know you or your situation, and I imagine you're making the plan that works best for you, but I want you to have all the facts before you move forward.   It wasn't always like this, but in the last five years, breaking in as an assistant has become one of the primary paths into the industry, ESPECIALLY on the TV side. If you wanted to be a lighting guy or a camera operator or a sound engineer, it wouldn't matter -- those are all jobs that you could conceivably work up through PA and other on-set gigs, which don't necessarily require college degrees. But writing jobs are often filled by former assistant. There are a whole bunch of good foot-in-the-door jobs that will be closed off to you because you don't have a degree and won't even be eligible to apply, such as assistant jobs at agencies (a very reliable feeder into writers' office support positions).  There's another tier of jobs that you could go after, but will likely lose to college graduates; writers' assistant and script coordinator positions are intensely demanding, high stakes gigs, and people tend to get very conservative when filling them, wanting people who are preposterously over-qualified so they can relax and not worry about whether the hire can hack it. Your lack of degree will give people to go with someone else. The fellowships & other programs that place aspiring writers on tv shows -- Disney, WB, NBC -- give extra weight to people who already have some industry connections and/or experience. In other words, current assistants. Since it will be harder for you to get those jobs, it will also be harder for you to get into one of these programs. That's yet ANOTHER route closed to you. College is costly and time-consuming, but it is also an external marker of grit and determination. With the exception of certain hand-holding liberal arts colleges, it takes a lot of work to get through all those credits without failing out or giving up. Grit and determination turn out to be enormously important in production -- it can be years from the start of a project to its final release, and with so much money riding on the line, there's no room for flakes or slackers. Earning a degree demonstrates an ability to stick to a long-term plan and see it to completion. If you don't have a degree on your resume, you will need to find and list other, similar markers. Completing screenplays, unfortunately, won't count. Producing short films that complete and win on the festival circuit would be a good, but not perfect substitute. I've also seen some success with people who trained for and worked in a high stress position, such as paramedic, fireman, police officer or serving the military. The vast majority of people working at networks, studios and TV shows all have college degrees. One way or another, they spent somewhere around 4-6 years taking classes (sometimes useless), hanging out with roommates (sometimes annoying) and getting into trouble (sometimes stupidly). That's not a reason to get a BA, by itself. But the consequence is that in interviews, in meetings, in the course of the work day, this shared experience is the source of many hours of getting-to-know-you chatter, and even becomes the basis of a deeper bond between colleagues.   Let me be clear: It's not Writer A saying ""Oh I went to Yale"" and Writer B saying ""Oh I went to Princeton"" and then they laugh and drink single malt scotch while money rains down from the sky. It's more like ""Do you watch college football?"" and ""Oh yeah, I went to Wisconsin"" and ""I love that running back"" and ""Yeah, the program's come a long way from the days when they used to do team dinners at State St. Brats on Friday night"" and then a lot of banter about the chosen haunts of student athletes at their respective schools and bargain priced beer specials and how somebody put their leg through a plate glass window and racked up an $800 ambulance fee.  YES, I KNOW ALL OF THIS SPEAKS OF AN ALMOST SICKENING DEGREE OF ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL PRIVILEGE.   But this is the population that works at the networks that buy the shows, and the studios that develop the shows, and the shows that hire writers, and the writers that hire assistants and the assistants that hire the interns and so on and so on. And college -- the misadventures, the boredom, the friendships, the small triumphs -- represents a portion of this population's lives that they refer back to all the time, consciously and not.   Without going to college, you won't have that experience in common with them. Again, it's not a deal-breaker, by any means, but it has to be said. You will have to work harder to build connections with people because you won't have that in your back pocket, and you will have to work against the bias that you're somehow lesser because you didn't do this thing ""everyone else"" did.   Here's the basic truth I'm trying to communicate: Television is tremendously collaborative. The entire process relies heavily on working with other people, winning their trust, asking for their help, getting them to believe in you. That's true of the intern who just started this morning, and it's true of the showrunner getting a call from set and it's true of Les Moonves walking out in front of an audience of ad buyers. If you want to work as a writer in this industry, you will need every single possible tool to build those relationships. College has absolutely been one of those tools for me, and for a lot of the writers I know. Many of us wouldn't have gotten this far without it."

Screenwriting,38lvbn,carboncle,2,Fri Jun 5 17:53:22 2015 UTC,"Financially, it sounds like you are in a good place to make the move. You can live off 2k/mo in LA, just barely, but you can do it. I've done it.  It's normal to be apprehensive about making the move. You'll never really know what to expect until you do it, and you'll learn along the way. The most important step is getting out here. It's true, the first year or two can be difficult. It takes time to meet people and start to feel at home, but it's vitally important. I recommend you get on craigslist and start looking for rooms for rent. Find a place with likeminded people looking for a roommate. Make sure it's going to be a place that will be conducive to your writing. You don't have to be in LA, when I rented a room, we regularly did skype interviews with people who were moving from out of town. Commit to a short term rental to get your bearings. Airbnb might have stuff too. Each part of town has a different culture and you won't have a clue where to move to begin with. Start with Los Feliz, Echo Park, Silverlake, Burbank, Glendale, Eagle Rock, Sherman Oaks, Studio City, Downtown in no particular order. They are relatively affordable and safe.  Unfortunately, in the film and TV industry it is customary to break in by working for free and unfortunately, I believe it's getting more and more difficult to find internships due to a recent string of lawsuits. Regardless, you should be prepared to work for free. Take any free gigs you think might be worth your time. It's a great way to meet people like you, working their way up in the industry. If you don't think a project will provide you any valuable experience or contacts, don't feel bad about turning it down. You'll meet a lot of slackers, idiots, posers, scammers and anything beyond or inbetween. Cultivate quality relationships, it will be more important than being the best writer in town.  You seem motivated and sounds like you are on the right track. I am more than happy to help someone who is looking to help themselves. PM me and I'll gladly answer any specific questions that come up along your journey. Best of luck."

Screenwriting,38lvbn,HotspurJr,2,Fri Jun 5 17:08:39 2015 UTC,"I've been a professional screenwriter in L.A. for 20+ years, so I can relate to your situation. My best advice is this: Have a bunch of great (no merely good, but GREAT) sample scripts to show. Have samples of scripts that are currently in production, and have some scripts that are based on your own ideas. Get to L.A., find a cheap place to live somewhere within ten miles of Warner Bros., Disney, and Universal Studios (so basically Glendale or Burbank, North Hollywood, Studio City). Share an apartment, rent a room in a house, whatever. Get yourself a day job to have money coming in (in addition to your publishing $$) because it's expensive living here. Then hustle. Meet people. Join film clubs, join Meet Up groups, pretty much anything related to film and TV. Get people to read your scripts. (Tip: Have business cards made. Name, phone #, e-mail. Also get a p.o. box and a 323 or 310 phone number.) It's all about who you know...and who knows YOU. But none of it matters if your scripts suck, so make sure they're FANTASTIC. Not having a college degree might be a problem, but I think most will overlook that if you're truly a talented writer. Another thing: This is a difficult business to break into (both film and TV; TV especially), so make sure you really want this. It's gonna be a long road to travel, so enjoy the journey and the adventure of what you're about to undertake. Good luck, my friend!"

Screenwriting,38lvbn,Slickrickkk,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:55:20 2015 UTC,"Beard's advice is very good.   However, I will say this. Whenever I read:   I feel like breaking down that first barrier is a matter of chance or prior connection.   I cringe.   Understand something. The single most important reason - by far, dwarfing any other reason - why you will succeed or fail in this business is the quality of your writing.   Yes, having people like you helps. Yeah, knowing someone can sometimes get you in a room before your work really deserves it can be nice (but those people crash out pretty consistently). Yeah, some people get lucky.   But most people don't. Most people who are working TV writers didn't start with a leg up in the business through connections. They EARNED their connections by being smart and interesting and writing work that people respect. Unless your uncle is a network president (who can probably get you a writer's assistant gig, but not a staff writer job) every job you get is going to depend on multiple people. Even if one of them recommends you for reasons unrelated to your work, the remainder of them are going to have to read your work and say, ""yeah, I want to work with this guy.""  I mean this in the nicest way possible:  The number of writers who are writing pro-quality stuff at 18 is vanishingly small. Like, as close to nonexistent as is possible to be while not actually being zero. It's possible that you're the once-in-a-generation exception ... but if that's the case, you won't need my advice.   Your goal - and I say this after having watched a bunch of people break in - is to be writing professionally when you're 28. You should expect it to take a decade.   If you expect it to take a decade, and it takes five years, awesome! You're in great shape!   But if you expect it to take two years, you'll never make it the five or ten required to make it."

Screenwriting,38lvbn,TadBitter,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:56:02 2015 UTC,"I was able to get to the Showrunners Panel at Pitch Fest recently and I found it pretty interesting.  I think it was Bob Kushell who said he was writing professionally at 19.  He doesn't regret that, but when they were all asked what they'd do differently, he said he'd like to have gone out into the world and gotten some life experience so that he'd have something real and personal to draw from.  When you jump right into it without college/life/jobs/etc., your arsenal is limited.  Just something to consider.  Film school really is mostly for the connections and to try and get some work done that helps you learn and grow.  Some people spend those four years getting high and screwing around, but you'll get more if you decide to.  As for moving to LA, here's a list of tips:   Use www.padmapper.com to look for housing.  It aggregates other services, so it's pretty good about having everything.  If you want a studio anywhere central or reasonably located, expect to pay $900 at minimum and it might not be a great place.  You can find decent studios at higher price points above that. Consider living centrally to make your commute easier in general.  If you live in the valley, it makes commuting to the west side (Sony, Fox, etc.) a pain.  If you live on the west side, it makes commuting to the valley a pain (WB, Universal, Disney, Dreamworks, etc.).  Los Feliz, Silver Lake, Echo park, Glendale, Atwater Village, some parts of Koreatown, are all good places to start your search.  If you want to go slightly further out, try Highland Park. It's great that you have income already in place that you can continue to draw from here.  It's possible to live on less than $2,000 a month if you're frugal, look for sales, don't go out drinking a lot (easy at your age), and eat healthy, but modestly by making your own food. For jobs, look into all of the following: www.entertainmentcareers.net (if you pay $10/month, you get the notices 24 hours before they go public, as the name suggests, it's career focused), Craigslist (sad, but true, just be careful as there are plenty of liars, cheats, sleazeballs, and scams), Mandy.com, staffmeup.com, productionbeast.com, www.anonymousproductionassistant.com/uta-joblist/, and any number of Facebook Groups (LA TV Writers, I Need a Producer, I Need a PA...)  Some of these favor reality TV heavily, that's a blackhole of a world as the pay will be the low, the hours will be long, and if you're good, they'll always be roping you into another one. There are definitely some jobs that require a degree and you'd have an uphill battle to even get an interview.  But set PA jobs and some office PA work shouldn't be impossible to come by simply because you didn't go to college.  They focus more on experience, which means you need to jump on as many decent sets (yes, for free most likely) when you get out here so you have some stuff on your resume.   I think I got one job in my entire time out here from sending out my resume.  Every single other jobs has come from someone personally recommending me.  So when people say you should join writer groups, go to church, join a sports team, try an improv group, and all that, you should.  You'll find that even on the rough sets, there's at least one person that is going to rise above that mess.  That's the person you want to make sure you connect with (naturally, don't force it), show them you work hard, and that you're good at absorbing and learning quickly.  I've met maybe 5 PA's in total on various projects that I would hire in a heartbeat.  The other hundreds that I've met...they didn't stand out so I'd only hire them if I had to.  They weren't working particularly hard or they didn't quite grasp what their purpose was on set (hint: it's not glamorous).  Now if you asked whether I'd hire the okay PA over a new person who submitted online, probably because at least I know what I'm getting into with that person.  I've had unknowns that we've hired off of online resume submissions that have turned out to be 100% crazy. LA does have a lot to offer, no matter what your interests are...unless your interest is running through a sprinkler on a hot summer day.  We can't help you there.  But we have sports, art, movies, plays, concerts, clubs, restaurants, hiking, beaches, boating, and basically anything else you might enjoy doing with your free time.   That's a lot, sorry!  If you have any questions, definitely feel free to respond here or send a message.  Good luck!"

Screenwriting,38lri1,HomicidalChimpanzee,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:13:46 2015 UTC,"Well, while the villain could be living a mild, peaceful life, they could also be in a position to strongly oppose the protagonist- see John Wick for example. The villain doing his best to take down the protagonist can make for a pretty good second act. Of course, John Wick is an action film, which is why this worked for it.  Something else particular to John Wick is that the person Wick is targeting isn't really the structural antagonist- That's the kids crime lord father, who just wants to protect his son, scumbag though he may be. The kid can't really do shit to protect himself. By divorcing the antagonist from the target of vengeance, you can come up with some very interesting dynamics. Just off the top of my head, could be a cop taking a stand against vigilante justice.  Then there's hiding the villain- look at Oldboy for a good example. Although this will inherently make your story a mystery as the protagonist tries to find them.  Something else you can do is have your protagonist succeed early- check out Blue Ruin for this sort of thing. Then the second act becomes about the fallout of getting revenge.  Ultimately, I think your best bet is to broaden your mind about what the story could be, rather than coming up with a clever agenda for the villain- it's certainly possible, but i think it would be pretty difficult for the reasons you stated."
Screenwriting,38lri1,rational_vash,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:39:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that thoughtful reply. The thing I'm working on is more of a classic revenge-action thing. The villain is the head of a small gang (by small I mean maybe 20 members rather than an endless enemy like the mob or something) operating in an arid, remote locale without much law enforcement and he would have the capability of sending ""soldiers"" in the gang to go after the protagonist rather than trying to face him right away. He's a bit of a douchebag that way, as most sociopathic and narcissistic criminals tend to be. This way my protag would end up having to deal with various guys being thrown at him as he tries to advance on the villain.  I wasn't looking for a clever agenda for the villain as much as I was just wondering what kinds of things I might have him doing as part of the second act stuff. There's a delicate balance between having him deftly avoid the pursuing protag while sending henchmen against him, and having him appear to be literally running away from the protag all the time.  I have a cool subplot about the villain's father, who is sort of trying to run interference against the protag throughout the story because his official capacity requires him to, but at the same time doesn't get in his way very seriously because he is disgusted by his own son and would actually like to see him (the son) get himself killed as a consequence of his scumbag criminal ways."
Screenwriting,38lri1,wrytagain,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:00:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's going tp depend on what the act was that brought about the seeking of revenge. (That was a very hard sentence to write without using the word ""protag."")  In some revenge stories, the bad guy is a huge hateful asshole we'd all like to kill.  No doubt he's the villain. He might be trying to avoid hero, or he might have no idea hero is after him.  But in other stories, the villain is someone who fucked up and maybe learned a lesson and isn't much of a villain anymore and the hero is becoming the thing he hates.    There was a great episode of Lie to Me, where a gang leader guy is getting paroled because he's now a changed man, supposedly, and wants to be ring peace to his old neighborhood.  He'd killed a cop. The cop's widow testifies to the parole board and asks them to let the guy out, she thinks he's reformed. So they do, and then she shows up with a gun to take revenge for her husband.   So now she's surrounded by cops who are supposed to shoot the police widow so she doesn't shoot the guy who killed their fellow officer. It's a great scene, I thought.    The ""villain"" ended up saving everybody, when he told the cops not to shoot and told the widow she should if she needed to, he deserved it. Or something. Anyway, what was his motive at that point? Was there a villain at all at that moment?   You might also look at Star Trek into Darkness. The villain is interesting in terms of his motive for what he does (taking revenge for the apparent murder of his crew) as contrasted to Spock's revenge-fueled need to kill him."
Screenwriting,38lri1,ExploreMeDora,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:19:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's often that the protagonist is trying to take revenge on a villain who has retired, found God, and frequently tends to his bonsai garden. The villain is typically still a threat. Even if the villains deplorable actions are in the past and he/she has no specific motive now, we are still worried about what the villain may do in the future.  For example, The Last House On The Left. This is a revenge film! The parents are taking revenge on the group of hoodlums who raped their daughter and left her for dead. The criminals don't have a sinister agenda at the moment. They are just trying to hide away in this home. However, we hate them because of what they did and we are afraid of what they may do later. They show no signs of ending their mean streak. So while the villains aren't always as goal-driven in revenge films, the protagonist is still technically stopping the villain from doing something evil."

What you can do is find an eager young filmmaker who's looking to bolster his/her reel. If the script is good enough, profound enough, then maybe you'll find a filmmaker with more experience who just wants to do it (maybe they can take the resultant film to a festival, etc.). Start marketing your script, see what you can do to get it off the ground...but just know you won't make any money from it and it won't do your career a heck of a lot of good.

A meteorite hitting earth is a matter of life and death.  But beyond that, it's a matter of life being unexpectedly cut short. Everyone is going to die in one week.  So how does that fact change your character's life?  Version 1:  Character is a stoner who has never really done anything meaningful or worthwhile or contributed anything of merit to the world.  So he decides to make / do something that matters even if it's only for a moment.  Your theme is being selfless in the face of adversity.  Version 2:  Character is a buttoned up business oriented person who has spent her life as a corporate cog, making her bosses rich, but never really ""living a life"".  She quits her crappy job and have an adventure that's all her own.  Your theme is the importance of taking time for yourself in order to maintain your own sanity.  Either version could work, even though they're opposite themes."

Screenwriting,38jpy0,joe12south,3,Thu Jun 4 21:50:07 2015 UTC,"This may be too ethereal to be helpful, but here is super simplified mantra I always keep in the back of my mind.  Concept (idea) needs realized through story.  Story needs realized through plot.  Story is made relevant through character.  Character is made real through dialog.  Theme  should be inferred from all of the above.  If you have a cool concept/idea/premise, your next step is to find the narrative. The beginning middle and end. Some people do that by thinking of events and invent characters to populate those events...some people take the exact opposite approach and get to know interesting characters, and then find events to drop them into. Both approaches are valid."
Screenwriting,38jpy0,Belerion,2,Thu Jun 4 23:47:29 2015 UTC,"Well, first off, ""space and mars and shit"" is not a concept. It's not anything, really, except a sentence fragment.    I would like to offer an alternative approach for developing story from an image. This draws largely from Aristotle's Poetics (which I still think is the best book on screenwriting there is), and Lewis Cole, who is some type of genius.    What you would normally start with is the generative image. This is typically a single image or idea from which the rest of the story flows. For example, Robert Towne woke up one day and realized that he could no longer smell the scent of orange trees on the streets of LA anymore. That was his generative image. Then he went on to write Chinatown, which is a story about change.    Once you have that, you want to figure out what your subject is. By subject I mean the one thing, one action, that your movie is about. In Chinatown, the subject is change. In the Terminator, it's about being hunted. In The Godfather, the subject is destruction. Really think about your subject, make it specific and irreducible. The subject is the one thing that creates unity of story. That is to say, every scene in the script should be dealing with the subject in some way; this is what makes the story greater than the sum of its parts.    You also then need to mass your subject, which means you start to think about the two sides of the question that your subject presents. Again, in Chinatown, the subject is change. The two sides of this are immanent, unstoppable change and resistance to change. So Jake becomes a character who is fighting against change in a world where everything is changing very rapidly. This then begins to inform your narrative decisions for the rest of the script. So you have your subject, you know the two sides of the argument, now you start to build it out. Who is your protagonist? Which side of the argument do they embody? Then, what is your antagonistic force - not an antagonist per se just yet - but the more general features of the world that work against your protagonist directly?    There is a lot more to it than that, but I think that should give you a good start. Utilizing this process effectively will also do you a great service by compensating for other weaknesses that go hand-in-hand with being a new writer. Formatting can be fixed, dialogue can be polished, but a story without a spine will never stand."

Screenwriting,38jpy0,DickHero,0,Thu Jun 4 18:35:10 2015 UTC,"The answers to your questions need to come from your characters. I think it's wise to spend plenty of time contemplating their needs, not just wants, but actual needs. Characters have needs that compel them to action, and when the going gets rough, if the character does not have a need (and it's only a want), then he or she will quit.   Having said that: often times we have to choose between equally cool obstacles to throw at the character. For me, that's when the theme comes into play, to help me make a decision about what to do with my character.  In one story I'm writing, a character needs fame. It's a real need for him, so when I contemplate and ruminate on obstacles I try to think of ways to put pressure on this character (his name is Doug) that would remove his fame. Then I have to ruminate and contemplate why this is a need for Doug and how he should go about getting his fame.  And this is inside his world, the concept of the story. Another character, his name is Raj, needs acceptance/love (not romance mind you, but real community). It's a comedy and he keeps screwing up his chances at acceptance by doing dumb stuff. If I changed the theme of either of these characters -- Doug needs money, for example -- it would change a lot of his decisions, starting on page 1.   You might try reading some literary criticism and discover the conversation folks are having about that stuff.   I find that this stuff is important to develop before the screenplay is ready to send to people. However, that isn't to say finding out and discovering the ""essentials"" (your word here) is a science. Sometimes you write something and it uncovers other stuff. For me, I don't know what's under there until I write it down. I keep a text document for each character and I explore their story, their personal life, their private life, their professional life. Sometimes these are long documents. Sometimes they are very short. Sometimes this stuff makes it into the story. But it doesn't.   I also think of the ""essentials"" as a kind-of research. The difference between this research and actual research is I'm making it up."

Screenwriting,38jpy0,dwitus,0,Thu Jun 4 20:58:27 2015 UTC,"This response won't be the exotic answer you're looking for, but no one here can definitively teach you how to write your script. The best recipe for getting better at writing is to write more. Your question is something you could easily solve yourself if you would just write a draft of the idea, compare your draft to a script you like, observe what works and doesn't, internalize what you've learned, and then, ultimately, carry the information you learn onto the next script. To me, that's the only way. You're at such an early stage in your writing; it's better to just explore. You'll get a lot more out of interpreting and internalizing your own mistakes than you will reading how someone else thinks you should tell your story. Plus, in the end, that feeling of reward, the one you get in the pit of your body, will feel much, much warmer, having learned these valuable instincts on your own. And ultimately, you will remember them better than if had you chosen not to experience them on your own. Good luck!"

If you want to focus on comedy, figure out a funny character (ex: Jimmy Tatro)/gimmick (ex: Annoying Orange)/situation (ex: Most Epic Nerf War In History) and run with it.

If you have the talent and the fortitude, you'll be ready to enter the marketplace in a few years (or perhaps a little longer). I suggest you also read a ton of pro movie scripts (which you can find on SimpyScripts.com) and also read literature. The more you read, the better writer you'll be. Also, the more you actually write, the better writer you'll be...so do BOTH. Also know that screenwriting is not an easy career path to take. It's a lot of work and not always much success (or money). But if you stick with it, and if you work hard and work smart, you could do very well for yourself. I've been a pro screenwriter for 20+ years. I've had some decent success and have made a few bucks. Most of all, it's been a fun ride.

Screenwriting,38jmbu,hollowaydivision,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:36:54 2015 UTC,"I would use ""YOUNG LILY"" or ""12-YEAR-OLD LILY"" as the character intro for the first actor who would play Lily, and then just ""LILY DODD"" for the second, older one. This makes it easier during the production process.  If she's 12 in the first part, wouldn't she be 18 in the second part if it's 6 years later?  Bottom of page 1 there's this huge action block:   LILY DODD, 17, blonde, fit, rapturously beautiful, is grinding out the end of a morning run. Ahead of her and across the corn, the Dodd house shimmers in the growing sunlight -- ‘Christina’s World’ brought to life. Back on Lily -- she’s exhausted, but her face is blank.   I have no idea what ""Christina's World"" looks like. What is the audience seeing on screen here? ""LILY DODD (17) returns to her house at the end of a morning run."" would be all that you need if that's all the audience is actually seeing here.  You don't need both MORNING and CONTINUOUS on the same slug line. If we have followed a character from one room to the next, or from inside of the house to the outside of the house, then use CONTINUOUS and we know it's still the same time of day as the previous slugline.   But in your two scenes where Lily leaves the Master Bedroom, and Mr. Dodd is drinking coffee, is this actually ""CONTINUOUS""? If the camera is actually following Lily from the master bedroom into the kitchen, then use continuous. But it seems like from what you've written, we cut to the dad at the table in the kitchen, then back to Lily on the stairs.   How would the audience know she's doing taxes? Maybe actually show tax documents, such as W2s and 1040s or something.  Page 3, if she is standing, how is her head under the faucet? Perhaps you meant shower head?  In the hospital scene, there appears to be 3 different girls here, A BALD GIRL, a 'blonde girl' and AIMEE DODD. Since the blonde girl isn't capitalized, I'll assume this is Lily? You should probably just call her Lily in this scene. So what is the importance of the Bald girl? Why introduce her if she doesn't appear to be in any more scenes?  You've got some formatting issues near the dual dialogue. There should be a space after the previous action line.  So at page 6 I'm thinking ""Oh, so this Aimee is an imposter, she's really a girl named Dakota pretending to be Aimee!"". But then by the end of the page that doesn't seem to be the case, it really is Aimee? So who's Dakota? I'm terribly confused.  Ok, page 9 he just calls her ""Dakota""? What's the significance of that? It just seems like a confusing bit that doesn't really add much to the story.  Page 9 after the KITCHEN slugline, who's in the kitchen? Every slugline should start with an action line so we know what we're looking at.   Mr. and Mrs. Dodd sit around the dining room table, staring seriously at Aimee, who is in the middle of a long, masterfully constructed oration on why it’s not her fault that she ran away.   This is lazy. You need to actually write her dialogue.   ‘Christina’s World’ again   What the heck does this mean?!"
Screenwriting,38jmbu,magelanz,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:39:54 2015 UTC,"I get the Christina's World reference but I can see how it would put off people who aren't familiar.   My advice would be to cut it from the prose but keep it as the title.   Overall, you have managed to create layered characters and a good story, which is very impressive considering it's only 10 pages long."
Screenwriting,38jmbu,lilchazzer,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:34:14 2015 UTC,"I'm very confused on what ""Christina's World"" is and why it's the title? It just comes off as confusing when reading the script, especially since there is no character named Christina and it only comes up twice - both times it seems to represent something completely different. Both times it reads back to, but back from what? Are we experiencing this from Christina's POV? If so we need to know this from the start and also who she is. If Christina's world is a metaphor we need more detail around it to get the point across clearly.   The Good:  Your opening is very good and intriguing.  You had me hooked on the first page.   The twist of Aimee lying was a good mid catalyst.  You have interesting characters that can show a ton of emotion and really make your story pop if given more depth.   Needs Work:  You can get away with being wordy at the begging to help establish the setting but after that you have a ton of description that has no impact on the story but takes up about 40% of your script. Example:  From far above, a clearly defined ring of trodden-through corn plants interrupts the swaying white-gold of the rest of the field -- Lily’s run through them every day, for years  This is irrelevant because the audience will never know Lilly's ran through these fields for years, your not showing us, your telling us and your only telling the reader not the viewer.    This is also a great example of describing something to death, you mention the fields multiple times and they have meaning but we don't need to be reminded of every full detail of them almost every page.  Lily is all over the place, she's the strong woman who's trying to keep her parents together for the last 7 years and when she finds out the truth she's too quick to forgive. She has to know that agreeing not tell would have to continue the lie and she would have to hear it over and over again, so when she snaps (which doesn't take much) it comes off like, what else was she expecting would happen?   The Lily cutting herself was too much, not needed and dilutes your ending. It comes out of nowhere and felt like (sarcastically) ""Of course she cuts herself"". Instead you need to have some more of her parents treating her like shit and conflict with her sister, enough to make her run away and never look back. Right now you cause conflict and end it as soon as it appears, let it stew and build up more.   Also when the Male calls and asks for Dakota, Lily has no reaction to someone using a name I'm assuming she's never heard, which is weird. She should be like, Dakota? Dakota who? or We don't have a Dakota living here. - I know she looses her towel but she should still respond confused and not like she knows whats going on. Also why would the Male have the home phone number and call it, risking everything and divulging all the details of their plan to a person who should already know the plan and events that happened, this is ""on the nose"" dialog and again is telling, not showing us. We also have no clue what the cigarette thing is and it's never brought up again making it pointless to mention other than to prove Amiee is lying.   You have a good story going on, just tighten it up and give more to the characters instead of the setting and camera angles. Push the tension to the max, start it out sooner and let it build throughout the story. If you're going to use montages than maybe a flash back of Lily and Aimee running through the fields at some point would be a good insert."

If you had Simon Pegg working on a script alongside the Cohen Bros, mixing and matching probably won't work.   But if it's 5 industry folks that know how to grind to the formula...it may seem like a reasonable business decision to minimize the number of slow beats that make it into a script.

However, the similarities are still significant and in either case, you end up with one script.

Now, normally, I would be appalled at this tactic, but this is a very special circumstance.   Wonder Woman is unique. She is THE female superhero. She is a feminist icon. She is a Greek God. She is a comic book character, etc, etc.  From a social perspective, it's important to get a female-led superhero project out there. However, that project also needs to be good. It also must be true to the essence of the character. There is no rubric for making a good female led superhero film, because it's never been done.   Finally, there is one other challenge that is unique to Wonder Woman: what should the movie even be about? Can't be a pure origin story. Wonder Woman got her powers by being born. She becomes a hero by moving to America. Her history can factor in, but it has no inherent conflict. You would have to revamp her origin dramatically. And therein lies a problem. Basically all superhero franchises have started with an origin story. So what do you do?  Wonder Woman doesn't have a definitive origin, but she also doesn't have many definitive stories or villains either. There are a few notable runs, but almost no definitive stories.   Basically, nobody knows what a Wonder Woman should be. The common thought is to play up the Greek gods angle, but it's not like that holds a ton of weight. Marvel's myth based franchise, Thor, is also their weakest, despite incredibly popular leads and the Avengers tie-in.   I think WB is smart to let a lot of writers take a crack at it, and take what works. This is the only circumstance I'd ever advocate this approach, but here it's for the best.

Screenwriting,38jhfl,Proxify,2,Thu Jun 4 17:06:44 2015 UTC,"In the classical sense, a logline is a one-line description of your story. You want to distill your story down it its essence without getting mired down in all the plot details or excessive character descriptions. There are four vital components to the logline, which basically boils down to this template:  [A hero] [battles] [a villain] [in a world.]  These elements may be rearranged within the sentence to better suit your specific story, but all four should be included:    Identify the protagonist -- Names are not important. This should be a single word or short phrase that captures the essence of the character, usually a personality indicator and a profession (or whatever trait is most important to the story).   An active verb implying the core conflict of the story -- battles, struggles to, falls for, must [x], etc. It is good to be specific, but don’t try to jam the whole plot in here.  Identify the antagonist -- Same rules as for the protag. Note that the antagonist is not always a villain. For example, in most love stories, the couple makes up the protag/antag duo and falling in love is the struggle/main conflict.  Identify the world - Use a short phrase that captures its essence.   Here are some examples in their simplest form:  A Danish prince seeks revenge against the king who killed his father.  A young man and woman from different social classes fall in love aboard a doomed ocean liner.  If you like, you can expand it to be [After inciting incident], [A hero] [battles] [a villain] [in a world.]  Once you’ve identified your primary elements, it all comes down to selecting the right words to best capture the essence of your characters and setting. The goal is to be specific enough that your logline can apply only to the particular film you are describing, while keeping it as clear and concise as possible.  While both examples you gave for Easy A could function as a logline, the second one is superior (though it is still a bit excessively detailed, particularly in the description of the protag) as it clearly defines all four elements with enough specificity to make it interesting and gives a better indication of the tone of the piece.  Hope this helps!"
Screenwriting,38jhfl,TheStoryMechanic,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:49:20 2015 UTC,this is really helpful thanks! I do have a follow up. Is it that both formulas I write are correct and they just each have their own place? Or should I always prefer the more succinct one?
Screenwriting,38jhfl,TheStoryMechanic,2,Fri Jun 5 16:50:17 2015 UTC,"For the logline, concise really is key. When you start getting into a bunch of details or multiple sentences (like your second formula above), that becomes more of an elevator pitch, which certainly has it's place, but is not the same as a logline per se.   Loglines should be simple, straightforward and to the point -- no grammatical acrobatics and endless dependent clauses as you try to jam the entire story arc into one sentence. This is not to say that it has be boring. You'll notice that the two examples I gave above aren't all that exciting and could certainly be punched up a bit in the adjective department, but they are functional and clearly refer to one specific story, and that is the foundation you want to build upon. Absolutely use flair in your word choice to be as evocative and interesting as possible when identifying the four main components, but do this in a succinct manner and cut out any details, redundancy, or other bloat that is not absolutely necessary to grasp the essence of your story.   The function of the logline is to identify the core of your story in a form that is easy to remember and repeat. Think of it like this -- your script is on an exec's desk in a stack along with 25 other scripts. Another exec comes in and says, ""Hey did you read [so and so]? It's the one where [a hero battles a villain in a world -- your logline]."" First exec, having read it, should immediately know that second exec is referring to your particular story. He doesn't need all the plot points outlined in order to recognize it, just the core idea.  When designing your logline, here are a couple questions you can ask yourself:   Am I clearly identifying the four key components? (protag, antag, main tension or conflict, setting) Is this clear and concise enough that someone can immediately grasp the idea and repeat it without having the script in front of them? Have I chosen the best words possible to express the core characterizations and tone?   Whatever exact formula you end up using, if you can answer yes to the above questions, you're in good shape. (Excessively) Long answer about writing short, but there you have it. ;)"

Screenwriting,38gf41,PunchAllTheRobots,15,Thu Jun 4 01:10:35 2015 UTC,"The real 'first draft' for me is the outline. That gets expanded into a beat sheet or step outline. By the time I'm actually in the screenwriting software and writing pages, it's basically the third draft - where the characters come to life and start determining things for themselves.  As the characters evolve and help me discover, I edit my beat sheet accordingly. When the script draft is done, I put it down for a while and work on other things. Then I read it again, tweak it and send it away for notes.  I find it interesting when first timers talk about how they're rewriting their scripts over and over. I always wonder what their rewrite is based on. If it's not at the whim of a producer, or manager, or agent, or close industry friend, are they just ""rewriting"" because they think they have to? Is it based on anonymous notes they got from a message board? Or paid notes they got from an online ""script consultant""?  I know that for me, when I was first starting out, I didn't rewrite my scripts because I knew they were amateur, and more importanly, I knew that I hadn't developed the instincts to identify what made them so amateur. I didn't pay for notes, or post my scripts online. I just kept writing new ones until I thought I'd got closer to figuring it out. By that point, I had people that I could trust to proper give notes."

First draft basically fleshes out the characters and gives me a sense of where they're going / what they want. I can pump out a rough draft in about a week, which is why I'm okay with it being so shitty.   Afterwards, I create a beat sheet using the first draft as a rough guide - usually the plot points sync up reasonably well and all it takes is a little bit of tweaking before I'm ready for the second draft. This takes anywhere from one to two weeks (I shoot for 10-20 pages a day), but by the end of it I have what I hope is a reasonably decent script in hand.  I'm pretty new to screenwriting, so it's interesting to read about how some people rewrite their scripts over and over again before getting it right. Also, everyone seems to have a slightly different idea of what constitutes a draft - I've read/heard everything from ""I changed some dialogue on page three"" to ""I flushed the first draft out the airlock and forgot it ever existed."""

I have another few goes at getting the start to work tonally and eventually find a way that I'm somewhat happy with. Then I keep going. The end result normally matches the outline pretty closely.   So for me, the outline is extremely important and makes writing the script much easier. However, easier is a relative term. I never find the actual script part easy in the sense that it just happens without mouth-drying episodes.  Once again: there's a huge, huge difference between a great outline and a great script.

The things I have written so far have been based on existing TV series (Simpsons, BBT, Star Trek, etc).  So I had a pretty set formula to follow.  And with all of them, the process was always the same:  1) In my head, come up with a general theme to the episode with a few key plot points. 2) Write a very crude outline using the things I thought up in my head. 3) Finish the outline by adding dialogue and action in between the main plot points. 4) Usually sleep on it, coming up with more concepts to link my existing concepts together (sleeping is my most creative period of the day). 5) Go into Final Draft and start writing the actual first draft of the script using all those linking concepts I thought of the previous night along with the stuff in my outline. 6) Keep adding more content until it actually fills the allotted time frame and flow of the show. 7) Then, go back and polish everything, adding more where is needed and removing superfluous/bad stuff. 8) Save it as a PDF and read my draft multiple times (for some reason putting it in PDF makes me notice tons of new errors I can't see in the Final Draft program). 9) Fix the errors I see in the PDF version. 10) Repeat steps 8 and 9 until I feel there is no more errors.      For me, developing a screenplay (or Teleplay) feels more like I'm reverse engineering a jigsaw puzzle.  I know what it's suppose to look like when its done and a have the corners (main plot points) figured out.  But I still need to put together all the inside segments of the puzzle.  And how do you put those middle pieces together?  By just trial and error, pushing pieces together until they actually connect.  Not the greatest analogy, but that's just how my mind thinks of the process.  Right now, I am attempting to write a couple pilot episodes for my own original concepts.  And it really throwing me for a loop.  Since I no longer have a set formula to follow, I have to create my own formula.  I can't just write a dramatic series in the same way as a Simpsons script for example.  This is becoming an issue for be because I can't just write everything down in an outline.  Despite knowing the key plot points, I don't know how to connect them.  Should I use a joke?  Should I keep everything dramatic?  Should I have a PAN BACK TO REVEAL to introduce a new location or should I just CUT TO?  I just can't answer any of these concepts because I don't even know the genre and formula of the show yet.  So I have to just jump into writing the actual first draft and do what 'feels' right.  I guess what I'm saying is, you don't always need an outline and solid concept before you start writing the actual first draft.  Sometimes you may know the exact content you want to write, but don't know how to connect them together or the formula you want to use.  And the first draft may help you figure that out.

Screenwriting,38h1cx,MarcusHalberstram88,3,Thu Jun 4 03:53:48 2015 UTC,"I read the first 30 pages.  The dialogue is good—don't think it's too witty, except maybe some of the dated references (Cher's almost 70!).  The characters are clearly distinguishable. I like Brie, but I feel like she falls a bit too much into the ""girl next door"" cliche. I feel like she's smart enough that she'd be able to be a tad more self-aware about that.   I think your own criticisms are spot on. For the talking, I think there are simply some scenes that are written well, are funny, and set the environment well... but are too long and don't really move anything forward.  I might suggest, as a helpful exercise, to take these characters you've made and rewrite the story with higher conflict. In Act 1, everything goes pretty much according to plan. Brie gets upset and his parents are mad he's back late, but overall it's pretty ho-hum. Maybe get him drunker, put him in a more suggestive position with Maggie right away, or else play with the passage of time in a way that puts a twist on the ""high schoolers going to a party"" trope. What if he took a swig of the vodka and you immediately cut to him drunkenly making out with Maggie? That'd really piss Brie off!  I'm just spitballing. I just think it might be easier to fully rewrite some scenes with a focus on pithiness rather than trimming down the scenes you have. Maybe do it for a couple of scenes just to see how you like it, and how the characters end up acting.  Good luck!"
Screenwriting,38h1cx,TurkeyUnicorn,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:55:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for giving it 30 pages!  To your note about upping the conflict, it's something I'll give some thought to.  However, given how the rest of the story goes, I probably won't be able to do your exact suggestions (it's sort of a progression for Patrick, from dipping his toe that first time onward).  But I like the idea of playing with the passage of time.  I'll brainstorm interesting ways to twist the trope.  Great suggestion.  Thanks!"
Screenwriting,38h1cx,TurkeyUnicorn,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:13:04 2015 UTC,"I understand the progression you're going for, and it's logical and realistic. Dipping his toe in is nice, but if you're talking about heightening the conflict—have someone push him in while he's just trying to dip his toe in! Then by the end of Act 1 the reader is going ""Wow! This is still the set up??"" Then your characters deal with it and build up to some more set pieces.  I'm just starting out so this is obviously just one dude's opinion. But people often say here to not be afraid to kill your babies—I think you've got some good stuff here... maybe you need to just rewrite and reoutline a bunch of the plot, tweak the already interesting characters, etc. You'll lose some witty lines/jokes and whole scenes that become irrelevant, but you gotta trust yourself that you'll be able to write even more gripping, touching, and funny ones on each go around!  I'm a tweaker at heart—I used to see editing as just formatting stuff, maybe cutting some lines, adding or replacing a joke here or there. I think that pales in usefulness to an actual rewrite that is inspired by what you've learned about the characters in the first go round."
Screenwriting,38h1cx,s0phocles,2,Fri Jun 5 20:46:46 2015 UTC,"I liked it.   Although the drink and drive thing felt preachy as hell. Patrick lampoons himself about it, then by his parents, girlfriend and best friend then followed up with Zach's close shave. It may read better if you down play the significance of the drink drive stint from his friends and then affirm it when Patrick meets Andrew and tells him in high school everyone is stupid?   But solid dialogue, maybe a touch too witty for 16 year olds but you're going for comedy so let it slide."
Screenwriting,38h1cx,s0phocles,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:04:20 2015 UTC,"That's a good note.  My goal was to throw everything and the kitchen sink at Patrick (see ""Weak Spots"" in the description) but this might read better.  I'll take it under consideration.  As for the dialogue, you're not the first person to comment on its wittiness relative to normal 16-year-olds, and if you can believe, this is a scaled back version.  That said, watching things like Superbad, Mean Girls, Easy A, etc, you do see that there's a tempering of witty movie dialogue and authentic high schooler dialogue.  I'll go through it again and see how it walks that line.  Thanks a lot for the read and the comments!"
Screenwriting,38h1cx,oddsoulpics,2,Thu Jun 4 17:32:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean I wouldn't change the dialogue for realism because it is funny. It just took me 8 pages or so to understand I was dealing with a world of characters educated up to their eyeballs with Juno, godly style levels of wit.

Do you have any suggestions to make this conversation more cinematic?  I already have a cut away (which can't be done in a play), but what action could I add?"
Screenwriting,38goa2,nymusix,3,Thu Jun 4 02:15:29 2015 UTC,"For me it comes down to a few things:   Genre convention. I'm probably not going to set a horror film in a Jr High School. External pressure/danger. A war film set in a jungle where survival is key will probably present many more opportunities for drama than the office a drone pilot sits in. Cultural influence. A coming of age tale set in Iran will, hopefully, explore themes and ideas unique to that location than a coming of age film set in Cleveland, Ohio would not. Visuals. There are some stories that are fairly independent of location but film is a visual medium and location can communicate theme or tone. Black Swan might equally work as well if it were set in another big ""Arts"" city like London, but the tone would be altered significantly if it were set in Miami. Logistics. Self explanatory.   In general, I find a lot of films don't explore or incorporate culture, either or ethnic or the culture and customs of the location (city, country, whatever). The last film that does this well, for me, is Nightcrawler. That can't be set anywhere else but LA.  I end with this, ask yourself: Is the location for this scene the best choice? Is it the only location this scene works in? Do I lose or gain anything from moving it to X, Y, or Z?"

When you get these notes, listen, don't argue. But understand one important thing:  When people tell you how they reacted to the script, they are never wrong. If they were bored, or confused, or in any way not engaged, they are absolutely 100% correct. What you do about that is up to you, but you need to hear their reaction to understand how your work is landing.   However, when they tell you what you should do to fix it, they're usually wrong. Not only do many of the people you'll be talking to in these early stages of your development not know that much about the craft, but they don't know what you're trying to do.

You will be sucky for years to come, unless you are a genius, or just lucky as fuck.  Tip 1:   Avoid writing for free. It is a waste of your time. Only write for free if it is for yourself, or the person you're writing for can guarantee an outcome (artistically or financially). Do not collaborate with newbs, who haven't done much writing, or directing. They are the worst. But there are always exceptions. If you see someone has real talent, and they're growing, yeah, you can collaborate.  Tip 2:  Don't just watch movies, and read scripts. Read books. Books are more original than screenplays. If you look at the top movies they come from books. Lord of the Rings, 50 Shades of Grey (unfortunately), The Avengers (this would be comic books), Guardians of the Galaxy, Shawshank Redemption, The Godfather, Walking Dead, etc. So, as far as reading goes, you cannot have tunnel vision.

But I know for a fact they didn't pay out fully the winnings and one guy who was the overall winner of all scripts had to buy his own ticket to supposedly be paid down the road and never was. There's too much if this going on."

Hey there y'all. This is indeed a rere-post, as I didn't get much action last time round. I just want to know how my skills are developing. I know this won't sell.  Genre: Action  Logline  McClane plays cat and mouse with a dangerous adversary with ties to his past as he fights to stay alive in a jail overrun with inmates.  Synopsis  Whilst working on a case in vice at California State Prison, the facility is overrun by maniac who sets a bounty for McClane's head. The winner gets 2 million if they deliver him to Nakatomi- alive. McClane battles cons, SWAT and works with the unlikely ally Dick Thornburg to get to Nakatomi and rescue Holly from a ruthless enemy. This is McClane's last adventure.  Questions   Is the story entertaining? Is it predictable or were you surprised throughout? Tonally, I am going for a mix of 1, 2 and 3. Did I succeed? if not, why not? Are there any glaring plot holes I can't see? Should I make the last scene an ""after the credits"" scene? How is the ending? Can you see this being a film as I write it? Or is there too much description? What works? What doesn't?   Link  https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2VbxeqAMVY4Yl94QmlkNWRNZkk&authuser=0  Best case, this gets high fives from everyone who is a fan of Die Hard and goes into my writing port folio. Worst case, it gets ripped from sternum to anus and is then worked on until it's worthy."

Screenwriting,38duuc,roboteatingrobot,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:58:05 2015 UTC,Absolutely! Here's a link to the script: https://www.dropbox.com/s/i8qe46yc2sgc564/%40Sherlock_ShootingScript.pdf?dl=0  The scripts vs. the final product is interesting since we had to cut out so much to make the 10 1/2 page script fit into the 3 minute short for the contest.    Hope you enjoy.
Screenwriting,38duuc,muirnoire,2,Wed Jun 3 21:54:16 2015 UTC,I found that entertaining. Good job. Good hook. You could spin off a web series from this by dedicating each episode to one unique problem a subscriber to #sherlock has and how Sherlock resolves it in a humorous way. Keep them to a minute or so each.
Screenwriting,38duuc,frank_rabbit,2,Wed Jun 3 17:59:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks! A web series is a good idea, that'd be a lot of fun. I like the idea of keeping it to a minute a piece....very intriguing...."
Screenwriting,38duuc,muirnoire,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:47:14 2015 UTC,Can I just echo the idea of a web series! That was really great and I'd watch more of these two. It's a unique concept playing on the current obsession we have with social media. You could focus episodes around one message/tweet/text and have it spin out from there.   It was paced perfectly and funny. I loved the dynamic between the two characters as well. The dude playing the detective is good!
Screenwriting,38duuc,oamh42,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:47:04 2015 UTC,"Cool. Run with it. Maybe the subscribers to the YT channel could be the actual source material for the tweeted problems and therefore you'd have something interactive.  In the beginning you'd probably have to make up the tweets though.  I like the potential of your vehicle.  I dabble in comedy. If you feel like it, throw me a handful of juicy tweets and I'll flesh out a sixty second script or two for you from the best ones (or maybe all of them if they are good.) If you like my writing, we can talk about it more. If you don't like it, that's okay too.  As far as qualifications, I did just learn yesterday that a comedy feature of mine made the semi-final cut on Screencraft's Comedy Screenwriting Contest 2015. That's top ten percent out of 1200 entries. It ain't much, but it's something. I need more exposure like everybody. Not a vet yet, but not a noob either.   So...  What I am proposing. First five one minute scripts are for pure love of the craft and writer's credit. One minute skits, about a page each.  If you'd like more after that, we can talk collaboration on YT Adsense revenue, yada, yada.  Interested? PM me."

Screenwriting,38e2sr,sheneversaysthat,10,Wed Jun 3 16:41:45 2015 UTC,"One way is to write based of your personality traits that you have but never show, this will give you an opportunity to write characters based on yourself but with a twist that's only unique to you.   Curb Your enthusiasm does this better than any movie or show. Larry David has said that the Larry David on curb is his true self that he never wants to show people. So deep down he's an inconsiderate prick but he'd never show in real life so he uses Curd to express his true self.   Write about acting on your fears, dreams, ambitions - things  that in the real world you want to do but you know you'd never do it. Personally I'd love to be a corrupt cop like Vic Mackey in The Shield, running the streets, snatching money hand over fist and doing whatever I wanted without much consequences but in the real world I'm a pussy with a keyboard, so I find other ways to express my dark side lol. Most my protagonist have a lot of my personal traits within them but all focus on an aspect of life I want to explorer but would never have the courage to do. I hope this helps and it isn't completely confusing."
Screenwriting,38e2sr,Emmydriven,3,Wed Jun 3 17:07:31 2015 UTC,"Don't we all?  The key is projecting both our strengths and flaws into our characters. If you're going to insert yourself into your films, it better be the most conflicted version of yourself. You want to look deep into the recesses of your mind until you create someone wonderfully flawed and fucked up. Woody Allen does this well. A lot of writers do.   And if you write consistently and are already conscientious of this fact, then it stands to reason that your characters will NOT remain you for very long.  Look, it's pretty simple. It's chemistry.  Let one or two traits fester for a few days. Seal it up in a mason jar. After a while, you have an entirely new mixture. These common traits give way to a character with very different experiences that do not echo your own. Are there parallels between you and your character? Sure. That's generally the case. But there will be so many new layers to your character that you can no longer recognize your character as an extension of yourself.   I have control issues. A lot of people do. Do they ever fester in quite the same way? Some people drink heavily. Others insert themselves into positions of power. I'm being very general here, but my point is that one or two parts of your personality can truly afford you the opportunity to delve into a character who you can resonate with and whose decisions you can rationalize, while also possessing the distance to paint your character as someone who has been tainted by life. Someone who isn't perfect.   TL'DR, if you're going to write yourself, be open. But for the love of all that is good in this world, do NOT make a biopic. You can tell when a writer is doing this. No. That's what books are for. That's what another writer is for. Most of us are not interesting enough to carry a film. But the parts of us that we keep concealed - the vulnerability? Please emphasize all of those things.  Allan Ball had the same frustration as Lester when he wrote American Beauty. He was a man who lost his passion. A lot of writers resonate with their characters, but they become entirely different people during the process."

Conflict: Lana wants this guy to make her a famous artist. But in order to achieve this she will have to give up more than she is willing to (not sure what that would be but I can imagine).   This is all from reading the (long) logline and not the script. My point is you're being too hard on the guy. I can mostly see how this type of story would progress. Whether or not he pulled it off, I can't say - and maybe it's not the strongest premise of all time - But it's a lot better than you're making it out to be. Edit: I suck at formatting."

Screenwriting,38fvjq,Slickrickkk,2,Wed Jun 3 23:11:35 2015 UTC,"Well I mean, if you want to just riff it onto the screenplay format, go right ahead.  I always write a simple 1 page outline of the major story arc, which will usually have 3-6 main points, then I sort of ""zoom in"", if you will, to each point, and usually come up with a page or two of writing for each. Only then do I start the actual screenplay.   I do this because my first try, I didn't, and I used to get stuck, procrastinate, have writer's block, you name it. Once you spend 2-3 weeks on a solid outline, the first draft of the actual script shouldn't take much longer than a month or two, given that you're able to devote time each day. 3-4 pages a day means a solid 90 page screenplay in a month."

Screenwriting,38d4tz,Dantendo64,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:08:24 2015 UTC,"For me, the most interesting stuff that I want to see, is what happens on page 5.  What you have is the first act of a movie.  We're not seeing the fun stuff, which is how she conducts herself after she's challenged to keep up the lie.    If this script was, for instance, the movie ""Liar, Liar"", it would end after the son makes the birthday wish.  But you don't care about that as much as you care about how he is going to act / react now that he can't lie.  For instance, in Odds, if she teaches Logic, part of her course curriculum could be how faith is nonsense.  You want to put her in direct conflict with the lie she just told.  That's also where you're going to find your humor, by the way.  The other thing is that even a short film should have an arc and a three act structure.  Think of a joke.  It has a three act structure.  ACT 1:  SETUP:  A rope walks into a bar.  ACT 2:  CONFLICT:  He tries to order a beer.  The bartender looks at him, ""I can't serve you.  You're a rope.  We don't serve ropes here.""    ACT 3:  RESOLUTION:  Rope goes outside, ties himself in a knot, and unravels one end a little bit.  Rope comes back inside. He tries to order a beer.  Bartender says, ""Hey, aren't you that rope that was just in here?""  ""Nope, I'm a frayed knot.""  Just because a film is short, doesn't mean it shouldn't have all the same makeup of a longer film / script."
Screenwriting,38d4tz,madcorewest,2,Wed Jun 3 22:19:08 2015 UTC,"I know about the three act structure. How i see it is like this:  ACT 1: Guy and girl have a one night stand, girl is happy to have him be gone when she wakes up, guy is actually cooking breakfast.   ACT 2: Girl tries to get rid of guy. Guy doesn't get the message. Girl gets desperate and makes up lie about destiny.   ACT 3: Girl's lie catches up to her.   I think emphasising the course could work, but that is a different movie. I'm trying to keep it focussed on the conflict in act II where she tries to get rid of him. I see from your comment that this doesn't work yet. It needs some more fun and games, more conflict between them, with her trying to get him out of the apartment and it not working out. The fun stuff in this short I think needs to come from the fact that she will say anything to get him out, him not letting her get away with it, until she comes up with the destiny stuff, which will backfire on her. I might need to exaggerate the situation/conflict a little more to get that across. I think I had the idea to let the acting and shots do a lot of the humor, by focussing on her reaction. I liked the contrast between a talkative needy guy and the girl who is silently hating on him. We're put in her shoes and experiencing her reaction to this situation. But again, I should maybe emphasise it.   I don't think I should focus on the course though, I think I can just leave that for the audience to fill in. I could maybe change it, I mean she could be working for a betting agency.   I thing I actually thought about was having a reversal somewhere, where we find out that he actually does this to make sure that the girls don't call him back after. Hmmm... It could even be something like:  ACT 1: One night stand, girl wakes up in guys apartment. She tries to sneak out without being seen, but is spotted by the guy.   ACT 2: Guy is being super polite, wants her to meet his roommates and invites her to a wedding. She declines and cant wait to get out of there. She leaves but then realises she left her phone. Comes back and he says something about her coming back for more. She leaves again and the guy laughs with his roommate about how he got rid of her. It's quite cliche...  ACT 3: They meet in probability 101 when they sit next to each other.   I don't know I feel like now I'm setting up a classic sitcom scenario which I didn't really want to do. I'm gonna look deeper into what I want to do with the scene and try to focus more on that. Anyway, thanks for the help."
Screenwriting,38d4tz,Emmydriven,-1,Wed Jun 3 23:33:23 2015 UTC,"I have to agree, where is the comedy? Max is an annoying character that I don't think people would want to see, especially if he's not funny. The dialog could use a lot of work it almost repeats itself too much and max saying haha every other line gave me a headache. Is he really saying haha out loud or is he supposed to be laughing? If you want to show him laughing then start a new line of dialog like so:  I found some in the fridge, I hope it's yours?  (laughs)  Do you have any housemates?"

Anyway, I'm gonna try anyway. I'd like to know if what I am saying makes sense and how you think I could get closer to that.   How I see it is that I work from the situation/conflict. He wants to date her and she wants to get them the hell out of there. We are seeing this from Tina's view and the humor comes from the idea that we understand the uncomfortable situation that Tina is in. I think laughs will come from Tina's expression: ""Oh my god is this guy serious?"". It really isn't meant to be a comedy where you laugh at jokes, more the situation.   Now that you know the intention, do you think I can get rid of some of the problems by limiting Max's text at the start and having more of a back-and-forth there? So make it more clear that she wants to get rid of him? I could even add a 'joke' about how she wants to leave but it's her place... What do you think?  I agree with the haha btw, I think I'll replace that. For me the purpose here was to underline the fact that Max is really not funny and is sheepishly laughing at his own jokes."

You might be better served by ""supernatural"" or ""x-worshipping"" or ""doomsday"" or some other word that is more relevant and/or ominous.  Also, in both halves you tell us what she ""must"" do instead of what she does. Action verbs are key. For an example: ""She fights to uncover"" instead of ""she must fight her way to uncovering."" Much less wordy. Consider where else you can cut words - do we need to know that the cop is in a new town? I don't feel it gives me a better sense of your story. I also don't feel that ""trying to control supernatural forces"" says much to me in terms of what your story is about."

Hmm. Ok since these are all I know, I'll compare it to: The Master, Wicker man, Eyes Wide Shut, Rosemary's Baby, and Children of the Corn.   What makes them stand out to me is they are all guided by this Woman in order to procure a gift to a Demon she has fallen in love with. The cult is militarized and there are implications of wide spreading influence. But it's ultimate goal is bizarre (to flood the world). So the cult has a lot of mythology behind it but I want to skew that as the cult is really an extension of this Womans desire to please this other worldy lover.   Why are you telling a story about them   They are a manifestation of this Womans absolutely destructive desire. I find it fascinating when people do horrible things out of romantic intentions. I got very inspired for this by the old romantic feel of horror films. I still need to think about this because that is a really good question. I can't answer it too indepth other than I love these characters and mythology I have created and I want to share it. Too many thoughts come to mind at the moment.  Really appreciate it, thanks working on new log line now.  edit: A cop must save her daughter from a Psychic cult leader before she triggers an apocalypse to please her lover. Killing her way up the food chain, the cop fights to unearth the mysteries of her daughters disappearance.  How does this sound?"

Screenwriting,38d6gc,pijinglish,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:28:01 2015 UTC,"""Too on the nose"" is an expression I find myself using a lot when reviewing scripts. It means I find the dialogue overly expository or commenting on the obvious, when I want dialogue that sounds naturalistic and alludes to the subject matter at hand or, even better, alludes to greater meanings and subtextual truths.  Because I'm in a hurry, I'll quote someone else:  Simply put, on-the-nose dialogue is dialogue that says exactly what it means–nothing more and nothing less:  “You’re a terrible boyfriend,” Melissa sniffed.  I shrugged. “I know, and I’m sorry. But just think about the horrible example my father set me. He was gone all the time when I was a kid.”  “That doesn’t matter to me. I can’t stand it anymore. I’m breaking up with you.”  My heart fractured. “I understand where you’re coming from. But I still love you.”  And why is that a bad thing? Because it’s two-dimensional, because it’s obvious, because it’s boring, because it’s unrealistic.  more here  Edit: I see someone else figured out how to use google before me."
Screenwriting,38d6gc,akcies,14,Wed Jun 3 23:08:16 2015 UTC,"On the nose dialogue is a standard screenwriting term meaning your characters say exactly what they're thinking/feeling or what is occurring in the scene around them.  It may feel like a character is simply narrating to another character.  When writing is on the nose, it therefore feels unnatural because people don't talk that way. We rarely say exactly what's running through our heads, instead filling our speech with subtext and innuendo.  Here's a decent description and discussion on it, with an interesting example from Gladiator."

Screenwriting,38d6gc,magelanz,3,Wed Jun 3 14:25:20 2015 UTC,"This article about coverage might be useful to you. Here's an excerpt I think relates to your op:   WHAT TO DO WITH THE COVERAGE  After you spend a week huddled under the bed because the reader found things to fix and didn't think he'd discovered the next Shane Black, review the coverage again. Readers aren't perfect. Sometimes they miss stuff. But for the most part, you need to understand why they gave you the note they did. Did they miss it because you didn't present it properly? If they don't see how Fred could know where George is, even if you gave George's location earlier,  maybe you need to make more of a point of that, or refer to it closer to Fred's later scene. Always assume it's your failing, not the reader's.   But - these people are people.  Sometimes they just don't like stories of a certain type or told a certain way. A good reader will say this, and you have to decide what to take seriously and what to ignore.  But still, think about it all. We need to be good professional writers and ask ourselves if we could do that part of the job better, anyway.   The first couple times you get criticism it's really hard.  But you'll get used to it.  Let it be hard. Acknowledge your level of investment. Learn to pull back and find a more objective view. Find your voice and what you are invested in and know what you absolutely will protect the integrity of and where you are malleable. Learn."
Screenwriting,38d6gc,svalbard5,2,Wed Jun 3 15:43:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's a vague note. As someone who's struggled with dialogue too, it's a comment I've gotten all too often.  One of the things that will help is to picture yourself in the scene. If you can imagine yourself handing a cup of coffee to someone, you probably wouldn't say ""Here is the coffee you wanted."" You'd probably just say ""Here you go."" You realize you can live with less dialogue when you see in your mind all the actions and things in the scene that will explain the situation better.  My dialogue still needs work, but I've become better at spotting the problem areas. If you'd like an extra set of eyes on it, I'd be happy to skim it over for the examples the feedback was referring to."

Screenwriting,38d6gc,From_that_which_was,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:35:03 2015 UTC,"A great way to NOT be on-the-nose when you're trying to impart some specific information is for another character to ask them questions about it. Have the first character be elusive and have the second one start the inquiry. To be even less obvious is to have them dance around the real answer for a bit. Drama is conflict, so if a character just tells you everything there's no conflict and that's on the nose, but if someone has to pry it out of you, then we've got conflict, subtext and a less obvious imparting of information."

In the pilot episode, Kyle catches Dylan cheating on Ava. (Although Dylan doesn't see him), and in the final pages he isn't sure if he should tell Ava or not.

Screenwriting,38ejiv,wrytagain,3,Wed Jun 3 19:46:52 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's the problem I'm having - which doesn't sound like a direct answer to your question, but I think it will get you there, circuitously.   I think you're doing something I've seen a lot of young writers do, called ""two nice people"" syndrome. That is to say, Kyle is nice and Ava is nice, so of course they're going to fall for each other. But I'm willing to bet you know LOTS of nice people you haven't fallen for, right?  One of the symptoms of this is the tendency to make the third leg of the love triangle a really shitty person. Obviously we want Ava to leave him because he's horrible. I have to say, I see this ALL THE TIME in bad amateur scripts. He's a controlling jerk who escalates to cheating and abusive ... yeah, cliche-city.   But your instinct there is good! You realize there has to be a reason for Ava to prefer Kyle, so, well, let's made Dylan a shit. The problem isn't your instinct. The problem is your cure.  I see this problem a lot in scripts written by young men. The understand why the lead guy is attracted to the lead girl (she's hot), but they struggle with the reverse. I mean, most early-20s-or-younger guys don't really understand what makes them attractive to women (or not) beyond the cliches. If you're lucky, you start to figure it out, but it usually takes a while.   So the question you have to answer is:  ""Why is Ave interested in Kyle?""  or maybe even better:  ""Why are Ava and Kyle a perfect match?""  Here are answers you are not allowed to use:  1) He shows interest in her. She's hot, lots of people show interest in her. 2) He's nice to her. The lead is not the only nice and decent person on the planet. She's had people be nice before. She's had boys who liked her be nice to her before - and she still ended up with Dylan. Nice isn't enough.  3) Dylan is a terrible person. This is a reason to not be together with Dylan, but it is NOT a reason to be interested in Kyle. These are separate things.   This is a difficult question! Spend some time looking at other films and asking it about them: Why are Celine and Jessie perfect for each other in ""Before Sunrise?"" Why are Harry and Sally perfect for each other? Rinse, repeat.   Lots of produced films don't figure this out - google ""magic hoo hoo"" for some discussion of that point. Spend some time with this. Don't leap at your first answer.   Anyway ...  The point being, once you figure out what that THING is, the reason why these two are perfect for each other, you reverse engineer it and create a scene between them that SHOWS me that in action.   And that is the answer to your question: what they discuss is something that reveals how perfect they are for each other."

""An ounce of dilemma is worth a pound of anything else"", said someone sometime.  e.g. In Taxi Driver, Travis Bickle is lonely and thinks he wants love/companionship. But in actuality, he craves self-destruction. When he's presented for the chance at a relationship he sabotages it.  Second example: Walter White in Breaking Bad. Thinks he's doing it to help his family. In final episode he tells us he did it because he was  the best at it.

I've got double that which makes things a bit heavier(Including a main character who is completely mute).  *Martin Blank  *Grocer  *Dr.Oatman  *Marcella  By the end of act 1 all 4 of them are incredibly distinct and layed out beautifully.  Mine is a horror story,  and...its hard to really describe(mostly due to it still being hammered out). There aren't too many examples out there for what I'm doing that I can think of, even though I've got a few bits and pieces I'm borrowing from other isolated settings horror films(Cube, Saw) I've got my own weird shit going on as well.  The isolated setting itself has its own rules to it(still figuring out some) its basically a haunted hotel run by a staff(demons) who bring in the living to entertain the dead. Anyone living who is in the hotel has 9 hours to find their room. The hotels floor plan changes almost randomly forming a maze.  If you can't find your room in 9 hours, you die and your soul is used to renovate the hotel(the hotel is made up of the souls of people who lost the game). There are 4 rules to this game.  If you damage the hotel, you die.  If you try to escape, you die.  If you bother the guests, you die.  If you die without breaking any of the rules(there are “dead ends” in the hotel), you start over back at the begining with less time.  I've got an agoraphobic mute woman with a temper, I've got an off duty cop who just murdered her lover, I've got a very masculine closeted gay man, and I've got a goth girl from the UK in the middle of a terrible vacation.  They have to work together to find their room, or they never leave the hotel living or dead.

Screenwriting,388jnl,TadBitter,2,Tue Jun 2 18:17:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not defending ""we see"", even though I use it a LOT. But everything about screenwriting has the potential to take you out of the story. INT. or EXT. and FADE OUT and SMASH CUT, can all take you out of story because they're directional codes. Scripts are read as blueprints to a movie. Of course you want your script to flow, but they're not written like novels. So ""we see"" isn't any more disruptive than capitalizing a sound."
Screenwriting,388jnl,40dollarsharkblimp,0,Tue Jun 2 19:09:25 2015 UTC,"Well, honestly, you shouldn't be using SMASH CUT or FADE OUT for the most part either. Scene headers and sound capitalization are necessary evils. ""We see,"" most transitions, and most camera directions are really not necessary.   I think there's one thing a lot of new screenwriters lose sight of: your goal is to tell a story, NOT to describe a story that will be told onscreen! It's a crucial difference. Your spec script is not the shooting script that will be used on set. That comes later."

It doesn't hurt me as a writer personally but I wouldn't recommend new writers use it, especially in a spec. But I feel that people are a little too paranoid about what to put in a spec. Sure, for the most part, you shouldn't use camera directions, but my philosophy is that if a random seldom use of it makes your point, I say go for it. But definitely don't do it in the first ten pages if it's a spec. And as I said before a screenplay should flow, but rarely is a reader so lost in the script that they forget they're reading a screenplay."

Often, the character is the awkward person in an awkward room -- despite h(im/er) being weird otherwise, (s)he doesn't really fit in. Additionally, said character has some inner turmoil or aspiration that drives their actions in the script -- for example, in one of my scripts, a character uses plans for a vacation in Hawaii to ask a girl out, while in another, an aspiring film maker and college student seeks out an aloof actress to appear in his film, and possibly be his lover. I essentially try my best to place the character in a somewhat unfamiliar situation to them, yet relatable to my audience.  After that, I take my shoes off and put them away, then put on the shoes of the character, whatever they may be, and I write from the character's point of view and act as (s)he may act in a situation.

When he experiences stress, he 'breaks' from reality and experiences the stressful event in a daydream that puts him in a movie scene that's over-dramatic, parodied, or satiric.
