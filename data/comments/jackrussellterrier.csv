jackrussellterrier,3cjmkj,danielnc06,8,Wed Jul 8 12:42:59 2015 UTC,I let my jack Russell outside for 45 minutes yesterday (fenced back yard). And she came in with her front leg injured. I assumed spranged ankle but her entire leg was swollen and painful to touch. Took her to the vet and they found puncture wounds. Gave her an anti inflammatory shot and told me to watch her. Swelling is going down after  an evening of sleeping and she's acting normal again.  Keep an eye out. JRTs tenacity gets them in over their head!

jackrussellterrier,3cegq2,ObviousCaptainIII,3,Tue Jul 7 07:28:47 2015 UTC,"We accidentally wound up with a Parsons Russell when we thought we were rescuing a Jack Russell.  She's a great dog, no matter.  Not all dogs are the same, no matter what the breed.  Do you insist on having a puppy?  If not, you might look to a breed rescue who could match you with the right temperment JRT or PRT.  Not all russels run away or need a fenced yard.  We don't have a fenced yard and our girl will NOT run away.  Unless there is a rabbit…in which case we better hope I have my running shoes on.  lol.  She does recall eventually though.  Training training training. You could always fence in a small garden area to let the dog/s run in without fear they'll 'escape'.   Good luck to you."
jackrussellterrier,3cegq2,lmseagirl,2,Tue Jul 7 21:50:26 2015 UTC,"1.- I keep mine in a house without a yard (tiny little shitty house) and they are fine most of the day, as they get distracted with each other and a few toys I leave around. I make sure to take them out for nice long walks every weekend and a regular walk around the neighborhood every day, or at the very very least every other day (I work a lot). You could have them inside while you're out and then take them out to your yard under supervision, but be aware that if they see a squirrel/cat/bird/ghost/wind and they decide they want to hunt it you WILL have to run and get them yourself, they get serious tunnel vision and will be oblivious to your calls.  2.- I have a male and a female (the female is spayed, the male isn't, yet) and they get along just fine, though they've been together since 6 months old (male) and 3 months old (female). The male is super friendly, he very rarely starts something with other dogs (only if the other dog starts first). The female is friendly as well, but super protective of me and the male, so as soon as anything comes near me she gets nervous/defensive, and if any shit goes down with the male you can be sure she will run at light speed from wherever she is to where they are harassing his dear friend and rip a bitch up. Lately they've gone at each other a couple of times, but that's because the female is super annoying and always on top of the male and sometimes he gets tired of it.  Word of advice though, these dogs DO NOT back down, they think they are Great Danes, or lions, or velociraptors, or meteors. Once they get going for real, you'll need a crowbar to pry them apart.  3.- They are not going all the time, that is a myth that people propagate because they've seen The Mask. As long as you keep some toys around and take them out for walks (or let them run around in your yard supervised IF they listen to your call very diligently) they'll be ok. They rest for most of the day (when I want to have a lazy Sunday and am off work I've stayed inside the house for the whole day and they are just fine resting as well, though sometimes they get a little antsy, and start playing with each other, which is fine by me. Just make sure to use that big yard of yours to give them some activity as often as you can manage. They will be happy to exercise. They do have loads and loads of energy, that one is no myth. I've played fetch with mine for a couple of hours a few times, and literally my arm got tired faster than they did running back and forth to get the ball, that is how much energy they have. You just need to give them an outlet for that energy when you're not in the mood/not around to help them drain it, that being, company with your schnauzers or another Jack Russell Terrier, and plenty of (VERY VERY hardy) toys, ropes, balls.  Word of advice on toys, get the hardest shit you can find. It's not Jack Russell proof, nothing is, they will rip it apart, but at least it will last them longer. I've had mine rip a toy that said it was for ""tough dogs"" in less than a day. These days I get them thick ropes with the bit knots at the end (make sure to get one that is made of natural digestible fibers, as they will rip it apart), or the hardest of the hard Kong toys (the ones made of black rubber). Those last the longest.   Hope that helps, and if you have ANY other questions let me know. I love these dogs to bits, and I seriously think they are the most fun race to have. They are a big dog in a tiny package."
jackrussellterrier,3cegq2,Mormoran,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:24:42 2015 UTC,"We usualy meet my parents over the weekend. Our JRT is super excited about that and plays with my father all the time. When we go back to our place our JRT immidiatelly goes to bed and rests for next 16-20 hours. They really do get tired, trust me with that :)"
jackrussellterrier,3cegq2,acristo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:26:57 2015 UTC,"1) A fenced yard is ideal, but not mandatory. I had one at my last 2 houses and Simon loved hanging out outside without being on a leash, but he was fine when we moved to the condo, too. It was much easier to just let him out back to go potty than have to walk him EVERY time, but that was an annoyance for me, not him.   2) Simon was great around all dogs, regardless of gender. Kids, too. He was my only dog so I didn't properly socialize him, but he was still fine. I wouldn't worry about it unless you see any signs of aggression.   3) I think this depends more on the dog than the breed. Until the last month of his life, Simon could walk for miles, play ball for hours, and be a ball of energy, but he also had very lazy days where he slept a lot. That's how he was since birth. He also had no problems being home alone for 8-10 hours when I was still working in an office as long as I took him out twice in the morning before I left and devoted lots of playtime when I got home. I think a lot of the energy warnings that people provide with JRTs is more to scare off lazy people in tiny apartments than anything else. They need physical AND mental exercise, yes, but it's not like they need to run a marathon everyday."
jackrussellterrier,3cegq2,Tr2v,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:11:13 2015 UTC,"If your not opposed to it, you can install an invisible fence with collar. My parents have 2 acres fenced this way and works well. It is a deterrent to them just wandering off.. I say deterrent because if they are full sprint chasing something, they will give a small yelp and keep on going."
jackrussellterrier,3cegq2,danielnc06,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:58:59 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about Parsons (long legged), or Russells (short legged)? Usually Russells are 'easier', and get on better with other dogs. If you're looking for a calmer/easier type of Jack, then I'd say a Russell is the way to go, but it varies between individuals. I would stay away for working type (JRTCA/JRTGB) dogs if you are concerned about energy levels.  But some Parsons are pretty lazy, like mine. My short legged Jack Russell x is far more active, even at 9 years old.  If you're worried about them ignoring you calling them, a long line is a good 'safety net'."

jackrussellterrier,3beqbe,menchiejrt,2,Sun Jun 28 15:29:02 2015 UTC,My Jack Russell loved strawberries too!  We used to take her with us to pick them at the local pick-ur-own farm. She always had a great time and would actually pick the strawberries off the plant and eat them.

jackrussellterrier,38hoaw,autowikibot,5,Fri Jun 5 00:45:37 2015 UTC,"Wishbone (TV series):       Wishbone (named Wishbone&Plouf, Bookworm Pets in September 6, 1999) is a half-hour children's television show that was produced from 1995 to 2001 and broadcast on PBS Kids. The show's title character is a Jack Russell Terrier. Wishbone lives with his owner Joe Talbot in the fictional town of Oakdale, Texas. He daydreams about being the lead character of stories from classic literature. He was known as ""the little dog with a big imagination"". Only the viewers and the characters in his daydreams can hear Wishbone speak. The characters from his daydreams see Wishbone as whichever famous character he is currently portraying and not as a dog. The show won four Daytime Emmies, a Peabody Award, and honors from the Television Critics Association. Wishbone's exterior shots were filmed on the backlot of Lyrick Studios's teen division Big Feats! Entertainment in Allen, Texas and its interior shots were filmed on a sound stage in a 50,000 square foot warehouse in Plano, Texas. Additional scenes were filmed in Grapevine, Texas.

jackrussellterrier,37ca3f,Sybil420,8,Tue May 26 15:57:53 2015 UTC,"Just like an old person, he will have good and bad days.  I personally feel that when the bad days start outnumbering the good days, and when his medical bills and care become more than I can handle that it is time to make that decision.    On a side note you might consider easing up on the pain meds a little because sometimes they can drag dogs down faster.  I know with ours, before we had to put her down, was heavily pain medicated.  She didn't do a whole lot of anything.  We eased up a bit by chopping the pills in half and she kinda sprung back to life."

jackrussellterrier,37ca3f,morganah,2,Tue May 26 16:25:45 2015 UTC,"It is a heartbreaking decision to even contemplate so you have my sympathy.   It is hard coming to terms with change and as your boy has aged he has changed but it doesn't necessarily mean his time has come.  For the toilet, would he use puppy pads inside?  I find it encouraging that he still wags his tail when you pick up the lead. Perhaps you could pick him up before the point he normally flags as to boost his confidence.   Does he have bad teeth? My mum's old girl was struggling with chewing and it turned out she needed all but two of her teeth extracted. She's now able to eat almost everything she did before.  Is he on steroids?  My jack russell has skin problems and a few years ago he was on regular steroids which seemed to transform him from an active, enthusiastic 3 year old to a slow old man. He was lethargic, withdrawn and downright depressed. After a week or so of coming off them he was back to himself, apart from the weight he'd put on.  If in any doubt talk to your vet, who knows your dog's health and  history."
jackrussellterrier,37ca3f,Elevener,2,Tue May 26 19:48:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone can tell you the answer, besides your vet. Our first JRT was diagnosed with Addisons Disease when he was 5. That came with daily medication and monthly injections. He did well for 5 more years but then he started going downhill fast. We also got another companion for him and that helped for a couple years but by the time he was 10 things were just bad for him. We couldn't pick him up, or even touch him without him being in pain and he was getting aggressive as well. We had a couple neighbor girls help take care of him while we were gone and he was getting mean with them as well. We made the extremely difficult decision to have him put down, I know it was for the best, he was in pain and things were getting difficult just to make it through any given day with him. The expense was never an issue for us, but in the end we talked with our vet and made that decision.   We now have our 2 other JRT's, Matt, the one we got as a companion to Maynard, our first JRT, and Theo, a rescue, whom my wife couldn't resist. Matt's now 7 and Theo is close to 3 years old. Having dealt with putting Maynard down, we are so dreading the day that we might have to deal with that again. Matt had some seizures that appeared to be epileptic, but we're learning they could be food related, cheap ass dog food is horrible...we used to make fun of ppl who choose to be 'gluten-free' then we found out our dog needs a gluten-free diet!   :)"

jackrussellterrier,37bln8,dontwanttosleep,1 point,Wed May 27 02:12:46 2015 UTC,"Ah the Napoleon complex that so many Jacks are known to have.   The best advice I can offer you is patience, consistency and lots of rewarding when a hint of positive behavior shows. Don't want to go through a ton of treats, heres a tip our local training kennel told us. Buy some decent quality hot dogs. Cut part of one hot dog up into small pieces and put it in a sandwich baggie, don't eat it though, its not for you, but keep your free hand in the baggie, enough so that there is a good scent/flavor transfer to your hand/fingers. When your pet does good even if its a small notion of good behavior, let them smell and lick your hand. If you have an above successful walk when you return from your walk let your dog have one small piece as a true treat. Keep this baggie in the fridge for several days and continue to use it with improvement. Once their behavior gets to where you want it, you can still give them praise and start off that praise by letting them smell/lick your hand, hot dogs present or not it will trigger those past emotions of being flavourly rewarded and continue the enforcement of good behavior. Cant stress enough consistency across the entire family and patience.  What worked for us with our JRT was when we were encountering another animal we would step aside, I would have our dog sit attentively and watch and wait - but make sure to curb any tension or aggression the dog maybe expressing while in another dogs presence. Sometimes we had to pick her up and keep her calm when at first and slowly this calming allowed her to see there was nothing worth getting worked up for. Now ours is so calm that if the walk goes for too long she gets scared to walk in the dark and will just sit and not move till we pick her up and carry her home. Hmmm wonder who has who trained here now!???  Hope this helps!!!!!!"
jackrussellterrier,37bln8,thedeejus,1 point,Tue May 26 19:15:08 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the advice. I'll definitely try this route in the very near future. I'm tired of crossing the street every time I see another dog so hopefully this will help. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain!
jackrussellterrier,37bln8,Tr2v,0,Wed May 27 02:09:36 2015 UTC,"Try talking with your vet - step 1 is making sure he doesn't have some medical condition causing him to be aggressive.  They'll probably need to do a full lab on him but it's pretty essential.  The results of the lab will kind of guide your next move.  After that, if there's nothing else wrong with him, you'll want to get with a trainer."

He even slept next to the suitcase at night, not on the comfy bed he normally slept on."

jackrussellterrier,36itmx,DatGuyWill,4,Tue May 19 18:28:02 2015 UTC,"Please get him to the vet STAT. Pay for the extra tests and X-rays. That's how my boy was for about a week before he died. I thought he was just not sleeping well and wanted to sleep in. Nope. It hurt to walk. Maybe you can catch it before it's too soon. And if not, a big bill is way easier to deal with than losing your buddy."
jackrussellterrier,36itmx,Tr2v,3,Wed May 20 05:23:35 2015 UTC,"I second getting him to a vet. If it's a recent thing and unlike his personality it could be health issue.  Could there be a climate/temperature issue that makes the midday more comfortable?   My mom has a jack that will often refuse to get out of bed until about 9am, and will stay curled up in sheets and her head on a pillow. She's silly and has been like that since a pup though."
jackrussellterrier,36itmx,siofeng,1 point,Wed May 20 14:07:41 2015 UTC,Is he peeing/pooping in the house before midday?  Or does he just want to stay in bed? He might just be getting grumpier and wanting to get more sleep in the mornings.  Mine is also 8 and she has definitely grown more likely to want to sleep in as she has aged.
jackrussellterrier,36itmx,thedeejus,3,Tue May 19 18:59:31 2015 UTC,I think he just wants to stay in bed. Even in the evenings now he used to be up and around but now he goes to bed at around 7PM. The problem we face is that if we can't get him out for a walk in the morning it may be his only toilet opportunity for a long time.
jackrussellterrier,36itmx,thedeejus,1 point,Tue May 19 19:06:36 2015 UTC,Can you lure him out with a high-value treat?
jackrussellterrier,36itmx,thedeejus,2,Tue May 19 19:14:55 2015 UTC,"He's a smart boy, maybe when he was younger a sausage or nice treat could tempt him but even now I'm not sure a high value treat can get him on the lead."
jackrussellterrier,36itmx,morganah,4,Tue May 19 19:19:03 2015 UTC,Might want to take him to the vet then.  It's possible he has a medical issue.
jackrussellterrier,36bpeq,BonnieandHyde,1 point,Mon May 18 02:16:26 2015 UTC,You're kidding me...my JRT is Kirby too!!
jackrussellterrier,362bwy,xGideonx,9,Fri May 15 14:36:54 2015 UTC,"I think one thing that could help lower the level of aggression from the Jack might be to walk the two dogs together as much as possible.  My Jack also has a tendency to be aggressive towards other dogs, especially at first. Often, the JRT is being more playful than truly aggressive, but many other breeds do not always interpret it as play. However, I have found that the more structured time my JRT spends with the other dog, the less likely he is to ""attack"" that dog. The need to demonstrate dominance seems to be greatly reduced. The easiest way to accomplish this is by walking the two dogs together."
jackrussellterrier,362bwy,RemoteClancy,1 point,Fri May 15 15:11:08 2015 UTC,Definitely going to try this. Thanks!
jackrussellterrier,362bwy,filmtips,1 point,Fri May 15 15:43:19 2015 UTC,Check this out if you haven't already. Plenty of good reading on the aspca site.
jackrussellterrier,362bwy,fr1ck,7,Fri May 22 07:22:04 2015 UTC,"JRTs need a lot of socialization.  Exercise them before putting them together to build up a good base of behavior.  If they have been exercised, they are less likely to act up."
jackrussellterrier,362bwy,Tr2v,1 point,Fri May 15 15:57:53 2015 UTC,"My Simon was never aggressive towards other dogs. He was a bit apprehensive around small dogs (especially ones that got in his face), but never aggressive. He was a single child, too, so he wasn't technically properly socialized. He got on really well with big dogs since he thought he was one of them. I dogsat for another JRT that wasn't as friendly (he was a shelter dog, though, and didn't have time to adjust) and one thing that worked was to feed them together, yet with a barrier. They could see each other, but not steal food (to mitigate food dominance). I also walked them together and sat with one on each side so they got equal attention. That worked well."
jackrussellterrier,362bwy,lorri789,1 point,Sat May 16 05:49:29 2015 UTC,My JRT loves other dogs and loves a good rough and tumble with them.
jackrussellterrier,362bwy,joelswift,2,Fri May 15 15:04:14 2015 UTC,ruff and tumble
jackrussellterrier,362bwy,treacledormouse,1 point,Fri May 15 22:22:05 2015 UTC,My dogs aren't aggressive. Especially not Rosie. Bran would growl if another rude dog comes charging up to his face though.  These dogs were bred to be fine in pairs/small groups while hunting. Most likely they would have to be around hounds too. A dog more focused on attacking the other dogs than doing its job would be useless.  Take them out together so they can get used to each other.
jackrussellterrier,362bwy,thedeejus,-1,Fri May 15 17:59:31 2015 UTC,I'd get a trainer involved or keep the dogs separate.
jackrussellterrier,362bwy,danielnc06,-2,Fri May 15 15:17:29 2015 UTC,"Our female does this to about half of the dogs she encounters. We have a ""shock collar"" for off leash training that has a vibrate function..no pain but it distracts her...now we go walk and as soon as I see that she is staring down a dog starting to growl/snarl, I will vibrate it to snap her out of it. And it works really well but she will need multiple sessions with it. Usually when introduced to a new dog she would start the growl and after  2/3 redirects with the vibrate collar, she was happily playing with them."
jackrussellterrier,35vax1,MissBanknote,3,Wed May 13 20:28:47 2015 UTC,"Just in case any one gets worried, we know her nails need trimming, but we try to put it off because of her horrible anxiety/fear of it. Soon, my sweet"

jackrussellterrier,35vax1,WinifredBarkle,2,Wed May 13 21:33:59 2015 UTC,"We've tried those sort of files and unfortunately it's the same result. She's absolutely terrified, so it's just a case of putting it off until we get concerned about nail/muscle issues and then just gritting out teeth and doing it. For a dog that will try to fight a bull mastiff, she is a right little wimp at times."
jackrussellterrier,35hgmd,kolkurtz,2,Sun May 10 12:11:02 2015 UTC,"I bet when you say ""Walk?"" there's quite a reaction!"
jackrussellterrier,35hgmd,Daffodils28,3,Sun May 10 17:49:56 2015 UTC,Not yet unfortunately. He had a difficult life before he came to us  and he is very scared of everything. He goes to hide when we grab the lead. Once he's out though and it is nice and quiet he gains buckets of enthusiasm. :)

I got through it earlier, when I was more focused on getting home. She was 16, though, we all knew it was only a matter of time, and at least we know she wasn't suffering these last few years, but I've just been a mess all day knowing that one of my best pals in the world is gone, and I got fucking stuck at school and missed ever seeing her again. I swear, I would've been home Wednesday, and at least gotten back before it was too late.

He killed the squeaker within 20 minutes but the body is still fine.  This red thing, also from Target, is still going strong despite intense daily gnawing.  Finally, this little Bionic orange dealie, which I got from a boutique pet store, is also still going strong.  I've had all three of these for over a year, they get used for long periods every day, and he can't do much but put a dent in them by gnawing off very small bits from the edges.

jackrussellterrier,32yjwk,Tirkaz,3,Sat Apr 18 15:42:18 2015 UTC,Perfectly normal but now is the time to show what is acceptable behavior and what is not.  Puppies like to chew a lot so get some toys to chew on and make sure he knows that the chew toy is okay.
jackrussellterrier,32yjwk,xcomv01,3,Fri Apr 17 23:21:40 2015 UTC,"It's extremely normal.  But you do have to set boundaries.  Avoid punishing per se - whenever he starts to chew, give him a toy that is ok for him to chew on and praise him - pet him and jump up and down and squeal WHAT A GOOD BOY like an idiot and give him treats.  Eventually he will associate chewing on his toys with attention/praise/treats, and chewing on feet isnt nearly as rewarding.  Now don't fool yourself, he is going to chew on anything he can get his jaws on for a long time - maybe up to a year or even beyond. It's your responsibility to puppy proof the house - anything he chews on is your fault, not his, because you left it where he could get it."
jackrussellterrier,32yjwk,thedeejus,2,Fri Apr 17 23:43:51 2015 UTC,"Hi I'm a certified dog trainer! You should check out /r/dogtraining for starters.  Bite inhibition is an acquired behavior learned through play with other puppies. The most important thing you could possibly do for your puppy is socialized him with other puppies. Get yourself into a positive reinforcement only training facility puppy class, and be sure they offer off-leash puppy play.  What happens during play is if your puppy bites too hard, the other puppy will yelp to immediately interrupt the behavior, and then momentarily ignore your puppy as punishment. Just like what the mommy dog does when a baby bites the nipple too hard - she immediately stands up, and calmly walks away.  Yelping from a human often isn't done correctly and only works to excite the puppy, so skip the yelping if you can't find the right pitch to interrupt the puppy without getting him more worked up. As soon as he starts to nip your feet, you immediately exit the room calmly and quietly, leaving the puppy in the room behind you. You only leave for a brief moment (a few seconds), and then re-enter. If the puppy doesn't go straight to nip you, praise and reward with play using a toy (never ever play with a puppy using your hands). If he immediately goes back to nipping at any point, you just calmly leave momentarily again.  This shows the puppy that the nipping behavior is extremely unrewarding without using any kind of scolding (which has no place in training, especially with a puppy).  If you need help eliminating other unwanted puppy behaviors, feel free to PM me, and definitely check out /r/dogtraining!"
jackrussellterrier,32yjwk,jourtney,1 point,Sat Apr 18 10:46:09 2015 UTC,Why shouldnt you play using your hands?
jackrussellterrier,32yjwk,TheLionfish,2,Sat Apr 18 13:33:32 2015 UTC,"Because you are inviting a bite. If you rough around with a puppy using your hands, you are telling the puppy that your hands are play-things, and your puppy will treat them that way, and nip them. If your puppy nips your hands, and you are okay with that, the puppy will think it's okay to nip all hands. This will likely lead to an adult dog nipping at children's hands, or guests hands, or whoever's hands, because they were made to believe hands are play-things.  Hands should be the opposite. They should be calming tools. Any time I touch my dog, I want her to relax, that way, I can carefully manipulate her, like if I have to administer medicine, check her ears/mouth/paws/etc. Handling a puppy is very important, so being able to calmly handle their mouth/ears/tails /paws means your hands near their body must = calm, happy dog.  It goes the same for people who grab their dogs, or hit them, or force them to do things using their hands. This causes the dog to see hands approaching as a negative thing, and you never want that."

jackrussellterrier,32yjwk,Glorpie,0,Sun Apr 19 12:14:19 2015 UTC,Normal. When he does this start shoving him off and putting a toy in front of him and play with that.
jackrussellterrier,32yjwk,lorri789,3,Sat Apr 18 09:51:27 2015 UTC,"Shoving him off will get him more worked up, guaranteed. You want the opposite of that. You want a dog who is made to believe that nipping is an unrewarding behavior, as in, as soon as the puppy nips, you ignore/leave the room if need be.  If you're using your hands/feet to shove the puppy away, you're more telling the puppy that hands and feet are play-things because you are yo-yoing the puppy away from you, towards you, away from you, towards you.  Have you heard of opposition reflex? You push, the puppy pushes back. This is not a lesson you want a puppy to learn. This is why you do not ever use force when training, especially when training behaviors like ""sit"" or no biting.  Bite inhibition is carefully learned through playing and ignoring. When a puppy bites another puppy too hard during play, the bitten puppy yelps to interrupt the behavior, and then ignores the biting puppy momentarily to ""punish"" them (negative punishment). This is how puppies learn to use a softer mouth during play, and not nip us at all because we use the same rules the puppies use when they're together, only we are ""punishing"" the very moment the teeth touch our skin."

jackrussellterrier,32yjwk,lorri789,1 point,Mon Apr 20 10:57:27 2015 UTC,"30 years ago, positive reinforcement training didn't exist. Building a strong, positive bond with your puppy didn't exist. Figuring out the true reasons behind dog behavior didn't exist. Your methods are extremely outdated. Almost all trainers who used to believe in ""showing a dog their place"" have gone back on that and changed their training methods to positive reinforcement because it is more effective. Truly thinking about the reasons for the behavior (nipping due to overstimulation, attempting to gain your attention, etc) will make training smoother.  Dominance theory believers, and people (like you) who use force and intimidation to train their dogs, often don't think about why a dog does what they do, and chalks everything up to ""the dog doesn't know their place yet. I'm in charge"" yadda yadda.  I'm a certified dog trainer. I study animal behavior on a much deeper level. I know how to combat these issues without force because I know why the dog is doing what they're doing.  I've met plenty of people (not trainers, but average to below average dog owners) who believe using force is necessary and appropriate, and I've had them come to me with their dogs having many issues that have manifested as a result of using force to train other behaviors. Do you think any of your dogs could become Canine Good Citizen certified? I've had many many clients of mine get their dogs CGC certified without any intense training, but just because they used positive methods from the start, instead of force. Just average dog owners who know what they're doing in training, and their dogs are winning awards.  Take a look at what you're doing to your dog. Force isn't necessary. Why would you want to use force anyway when there are methods out there, methods that work, that help form a positive bond between you and your dog. That motivate your dog to obey you in a positive way. That builds up your dogs drive. Why not use those methods if they exist? Just because using force is easier? It let's out your frustration? Well, I won't speculate, but you should think about it."

jackrussellterrier,32giex,welcome2sydneysworld,2,Mon Apr 13 16:43:59 2015 UTC,"Was she an only pup? 16 is actually already kinda old to socialize just via play. Since she's already growling and nipping, you need to correct her now. Make sure you're calm at he dog park and talk to her gently when a dog comes up to sniff, praise for sniffing, but as soon as she starts growling, tell her firmly that that's not ok! You can pick a command or noise or you could even lightly touch her back/side (something that startles her enough to distract her from growling). She needs to know that she absolutely cannot growl at a friendly dog. Terriers are notorious for nipping so stop it now!  Another thing to try is to distract her via a command from the other dog, so when the other dog comes up, ask her to sit or down or shake or whatever other command you're working on and praise her lavishly when she does it without paying attention to the other dog. Just be careful with treats at the dog park.   I have a very dog-aggressive dog (not a terrier, a minpin mix) and with her, it took a few months of corrections and even forced sniffings (where I'd pick her up and put her on her back and 'present' her hind end for the friendly dog to sniff) for her to ease up on the growling and charging. I mean, she would go after a completely friendly dog, even puppies, hackles up and teeth bared, it was scary! Now she still hates everybody but she will listen to me and try her hardest to ignore the other dog.  Good luck! Hope the puppy class will help."

jackrussellterrier,32giex,scomperpotamus,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:39:24 2015 UTC,Definitely...jrt's can and will become very aggressive and nasty if this isn't nipped in the bud asap.  They have very sharp teeth for a small dog and an insane prey instinct.  Do not let this continue without getting a trainer involved

jackrussellterrier,2ytjkl,MrsEschmann,1 point,Sun Mar 15 01:09:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah he's our first dog. We were worried about training him so we read loads in online info. He's still a puppy so he gets away with a lot, but we have taught him to sit and wait (generally only works if you have a treat though) he's a really smart dog so he kinda decides what he wants to do/when he's done something wrong. Overall I would say he would be easy to train if we were a little stricter with him, but look at that face."
jackrussellterrier,2ytjkl,HuevosGrande,1 point,Sun Mar 15 10:08:51 2015 UTC,"My best piece of advice for you is to be patient.  They are smart dogs, but stubborn.  As soon as you are about to give up, they get it!  You have to train the new trick a few times a day until they pick it up.  We taught Daisy at 9 months old how to sit, lay down, give paw, sit pretty, and roll over.  I watched a few YouTube videos, but for the most part I just kept trying over and over.  Now she does it all without a treat!  It took us about a month to teach her all that."

jackrussellterrier,2wyzqa,MoheyEzzat,5,Tue Feb 24 08:39:46 2015 UTC,"I went blindly and bought a JRT.  I had no idea what I was getting into.   I bought him from a breeder and met in a parking lot of a gas station.   It was love at first sight.    Then, as he grew, he ate my cell phone, the carpet, the underlay and the subfloor.  He ate drywall, and underwear and chewed a few pairs of glasses.   Then he ran away twice from my mom who was supposed to be watching him.  He cost me a whole damage deposit on an apartment.   He was pooping and peeing in the spare bedrooms when we weren't looking.   But then we started walking him. Everyday. His behaviour improved practically overnight. He always had free reign in the house but we now kennel him during the day.  It's calming to him to be somewhere he feels safe.   And it's better for us, we know he's not shitting/pissing all over the place while we're out.    All of that being said I whole heartedly think you should get one.   They are the best companions: loyal, loving, and will always be by your side, tail wagging, looking at you with those puppy dog eyes :).    I miss mine just thinking about him!"
jackrussellterrier,2wyzqa,boobercal,1 point,Tue Feb 24 16:47:06 2015 UTC,Thank you so much. I really considering getting one. I have a backyard where he can do whatever he wants over there if you know what I mean :-). Is that good? Or it's better to keep him inside the house?
jackrussellterrier,2wyzqa,siofeng,1 point,Wed Feb 25 08:59:47 2015 UTC,"a backyard is a must, but JRTs can dig and jump very well. we have a fenced yard, and then had to dig and put fencing about a foot underground around the whole yard. Don't ever think ""this will do"" because a JRT can probably still get out of the yard. Yet, they need to have the space to run around like mad."
jackrussellterrier,2wyzqa,Stuck_in_TN,2,Wed Feb 25 15:11:15 2015 UTC,"If you have never owned a dog, or are not very experienced with training them, I would not recommend getting a JRT. If you do not train them properly and make sure you establish authority, they WILL try to take over and control YOU. They are very smart, energetic, and super loyal."
jackrussellterrier,2wyzqa,Stuck_in_TN,1 point,Tue Feb 24 15:46:48 2015 UTC,Currently I have a Labrador. Very loving and energetic :-). But as I heard that the JRT needs special treatment. Isn't it?
jackrussellterrier,2wyzqa,tundar,2,Wed Feb 25 09:01:21 2015 UTC,"JRTs are known as the ""Napoleons"" of the dog world. They are small dogs with big personalities. You need to establish who is the boss early on and will need to reinforce it constantly. For example, my mom also has a JRT. However, she is not as constant or as disciplined with her training as I am. She spoiled her dog early on without much structure. As a result, our two dogs could not be more different. Hers is very possessive and actually gets aggressive. He's possessive of toys, food, his crate, even her. He'll snap and try to bite if you do something he doesn't like. Mine, on the other hand, is protective but not aggressive. You can pet him while he's in his crate, walk by him as he eats, and play fetch and tug of war with his toys with no problems.   I will say this, they are the most loyal dog breed I have ever owned. Mine is super happy laying on my lap and will not leave my side even if my kids call him to go play in their room. Once they bond with you, it is a very strong bond."
jackrussellterrier,2wyzqa,suicidemedic,2,Wed Feb 25 13:29:00 2015 UTC,"Do a ton of research first!!  JRTs are amazing, and I love my dog, but they are not easy dogs to raise, live with, and train. They're extremely time consuming, much more than most other dogs, incredibly active, will chew anything, get bored and in to trouble easily, very stubborn, and have big personalities. They're best suited to experienced dog owners and need a lot of training and excessive. They are NOT apartment dogs, even though they're small, unless you can give them at least 2 hours/day of high energy exercise (walking is not enough! They need to run and play). They love running at break neck speeds and digging massive holes. They can get possessive over items like your blankets and you have to be consistent and discourage it.  JRTs make amazing companions. They're loyal, and energetic, and will get you out of bed in the morning with nothing but love (and barking!). Once they bond to you they'll do anything for you, including trying to protect you from the dogs on TV. They're also incredibly smart and resilient and there's very little that will slow them down. They're very food-motivated, which is good for training, but they have a tendency to over eat so you have to keep them on a strict diet. An overweight JRT is a very sick and very depressed JRT. They're crazy bundles of energy with giant personalities (this is completly true).  If this has been more confusing then helpful, well, it was supposed to be. JRTs are a serious commitment, one not to be taking lightly or on a whim. With proper care, and training!, JRTs are one of the absolute best companion dogs out there.  I love my JRT but he's still a crazy little shit."
jackrussellterrier,2wyzqa,7rider,3,Tue Feb 24 14:26:37 2015 UTC,"I concur with all of this. They are the most obedient/loving/loyal dog in the world, IF they get heavy exercise and good training."

jackrussellterrier,2w0pri,LittleBearsPatches,2,Sun Feb 15 23:34:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your opinions guys. I understand a two JRT household will be quite energetic and crazy. But I'm willing to accept that into my life. Django is what I put most of my time into right now anyway.   Django is a rather calm and timid JRT, he's definitely a submissive type. The shepherd we have here is a female, and much more dominant. Because Django is not dominant he can have his food stolen away by the larger dog. Therefor I have to sit next to him so he feels comfortable enough to have his full go at the food dish. Or I bring his dish into my bedroom for him to snack on in between play /cuddles.   The female addition is not going to take care of actually entertaining and caring for the dogs. I know this. I simply want him to have an available playmate (and partner in crime) when we are not at home for them.   Walking them together is a great idea, and I'd love to try it when the time comes.   Thank you guys for your replies!"
jackrussellterrier,2w0pri,baymare,1 point,Mon Feb 16 17:31:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think the fact that your dog is a JRT cross is going to play much into this. It's all personality. I had my JRT first, then decided to get a second dog for company. Got a minpin/chihuahua from the pound on impulse, and my terrier just had to adjust, lol. Few things that will help the transition -  Opposite sex is usually better. Less fighting. I'd go for opposite dominance behavior too, as far as one can judge that. My minchi is much more dominant and my JRT very submissive, so they quickly figured out how to get along.  Make sure both dogs have space to get away from each other. My dogs have their own 'room' (crate) each that the other is not really allowed in. Sometimes when they're playing they'll run into each other's crates but when it's time to rest or time for a time out for bad behavior, they go into their own crates.  The other commentor, fr1ck, has a good point - while it does help that my dogs are playing with each other, it still is almost double the work having two, especially if you don't have a good place to let them run loose. You want to make sure to spend roughly equal time with each of them. My JRT used to love playing tug-o-war, but my minchi is so aggressive about the game that he's stopped playing it with me almost entirely because she jumps in and grabs the toy, so to make up for that I make sure he gets extra individual attention every day, something he loves, like getting brushed.  I understand that you want your boyfriend to be the main caretaker of the new dog, but one of the best bonding exercises for a new dog is to take walks with both dogs together. I bought a leash connector and walked both dogs on one leash, and they had to learn to cooperate so they wouldn't pull each other into different directions and I do believe that helped them get along faster than anything else.   So to sum up this novel - opposite sex, opposite dominance (though similar energy levels are good!), individual crates, individual attention, walking together, all that has helped make my 2 dog household a pretty calm and pleasant one, though I might've just lucked out, haha. My JRT is pretty mellow and well-behaved and has actually helped train my Minchi (by tackling her when she doesn't listen!! lol). Your dog is young and has already lived with another dog before, so he'll likely be just fine."

I had a female that would steal my slipper. But only when I went to stand up. We'd be lazing around the house, watching TV and I'd be on the couch usually with my slippers off and sitting on the floor in front of me.   When I went to stand up the dog, even if she was apparently dead asleep, would fly from wherever she was, snatch one of my slippers and run away with it.   EVERY.  SINGLE.  TIME.  She didn't destroy it, or chew it up. She'd shake the hell out of it like it was a rat she'd caught, but never did it any harm. But I'd have to go clumping around the house in one slipper until she finally gave it up. None of my other JRTs did this.  She had other strange habits too. I sure do miss her (she lived a long and happy life, then died in the arms of her family)."

Ya freaking cans!!! If I am working outside and the wind blows an empty pop can out of the recycling or my empty beer can blows on to the ground that dog will chew that can in half, gums bleeding to no end and she will still growl if you try and take it from her. And for those worried/concerned, to my knowledge she has never eaten any of the pieces that we know of and yes we know that cans be deadly to the dog, hence why we take these away as soon as we see her with one, but man she sure put up one hell of a fight when you go to!

It works so well. Just make sure you understand the method as well and give the dog a chance to get what you're trying to do. He is up to 15 ""tricks"" now and he's only a year old. Whenever I pull out the clicker and gets excited and pays attention. I usually throw the ball around a couple of times to get some of the energy out of him before we start anything new.  I would get him around other dogs at a young age. Big and small. It helps them be more friendly and not freak out everytime they see another dog.  I would look into getting an antler for a solitude toy. They last forever and he loves his.  http://www.amazon.com/Barkworthies-Natural-Elk-Antler-Medium/dp/B006H33NL2/ref=sr_1_7?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1421930818&sr=1-7&keywords=dog+antler+chew"
jackrussellterrier,2ta46p,adamomg,2,Thu Jan 22 12:49:13 2015 UTC,"I've got a Jack Mix (with Corgi, maybe). He's more Jack than anything else. I initially tried clicker training and he would always cower away from the noise. He did not like it one bit. He is incredibly food motivated, especially if it's from a human. He can be uninterested in Kibble from his Kong wobble toy, I'll pull a few pieces and he'll bend over backwards for them. Unfortunately he won't do anything unless you have treats. We've tried to wean him off of them but it hasn't worked.  As far as solitude toys go: the more the better. Ours only got destructive when he was insanely bored (had no toys), even then he only ever destroyed a pair of gloves and some flip flops. Nowadays there is always a few stuffed animal toys (cheap ones which he will destroy), a rawhide bone, water buffalo antler and a Kong Wobbler full of kibble (which is how he is fed). I have used a camera to see what he does when I'm gone. He just sleeps on the couch and waits for me. Doesn't play much or even eat.   I did regular training classes with my Jack and they went pretty well. Helped with obedience and general human-dog relationship (and he did learn a few tricks). Biggest downfall was his lack of early socialization (got him when he was almost a year old, history unknown). When he gets within ~3' of a bigger dog he suddenly flips a shit and will try to attack them. He loves dogs his size (or smaller).   I'd say training is fairly easy if you can effectively communicate what you want and you put in the time."

jackrussellterrier,2ta46p,swindlebin,2,Thu Jan 22 16:13:08 2015 UTC,"I have a JRT mix, too. She is very energetic and would wake me up at 2am just to play.  I got her when she was 5 months old and I used a clicker when I started training her. It worked and eventually, I no longer had to use it and she now follows verbal commands without it. JRTs are very fast learners so you won't have any problems with a clicker. I got her a huge kong and stuffed it with the small bite sized treats. It's the red one that twists open  I also got smaller kongs that and stuffed frozen peanut butter in them.  What occupied most her time were the rawhide bones. I also left the television on for her whenever I would be away for the day, just so she would not feel lonely. She has lots of toys-a huge basketful. Having a variety of toys is very beneficial because when they get bored, they tend to destroy things.  Make sure you don't give your dog stuffed animals with beads or buttons for eyes. JRTs love to tear them out. She loves playing tug with her toys and always wants interaction. When I get too busy or am too tired to physically play, I used a laser pointer and let her chase it around the house until she gets tired. To help her get used to other dogs, I offered to baby sit my neighbor's puppy whenever my neighbor would work late nights. My dog and her dog would keep each other entertained, running around chasing each other.  This definitely tired my dog out by the end of the night.  If you have any more questions, feel free to PM me. Good luck and congrats on becoming a new mommy! =)"

While he doesn't seem bored yet, (he still has a really zen side to him) I want to be prepared so that he doesnt' get that way. I'll definitely invest in a few more Kongs.   He does have a good variety of stuffed toys (proper dog friendly ones) and they get replaced when he goes through them.   I think I will look into a clicker training class, I'd feel more confident taking a class first. There is one in our area with an open schedule which is definitely more suited to our personal schedule. He spent his first years with a family that had a small child and a larger dog, so socially he's pretty good. I've had my neice's lab/spaniel mix in at Christmas and my son was just down with his miniature Schnauzer, all got along just fine. I don't know if he had any proper training, he does know the sit command and wait command when he feels like it. I tried this morning to get him to sit outdoors, but he wasn't having any of that. He knew what I wanted, knew what he should do but he avoided my gaze, rather sheepishly actually."
jackrussellterrier,2ta46p,adamomg,1 point,Thu Jan 22 23:17:52 2015 UTC,I actually learned to clicker train off of some YouTube videos. Just buy a clicker and keep at it.  Might want to look into the no stuffing toys. Harder to rip apart.   Kikopup videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/kikopup

Now, he's NOT on a leash during that time though. We go to the beach or the woods, and he zooms in and out the bushes the whole time, so if I walk a mile or three he probably doubles that and he's nowhere near tired after that, just content to be chilling on the couch, but I know he can go for hours still. If I can't make it to a place where he can be off-leash and hunt, I will take him for walks around the apartment but I can tell it's not really satisfying to him because he can't smell and dig and chase."
jackrussellterrier,2rwh2x,baymare,2,Sat Jan 10 05:00:57 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll look to see if there are any fenced in dog parks in the area where he or she could reek leash-less havoc every once in a while! and get many destroyable toys.

jackrussellterrier,2qzrmf,Adddicus,4,Thu Jan 1 15:38:15 2015 UTC,"He is usually all the time with me (at my shop, home) and he has usually someone staying with him when I go. Plus, all the other times I have recorded him he is quite calm! Only that time he was so anxious, this is why I actually posted the video, I think it is because we had recently moved and he wasn't feeling very safe. Generally though he is very attached. I am trying now to leave him alone for a few minutes (about 10) every few days so he can slowly learn that I will be coming back. Unfortunately, even though I would love to have a second dog this is not an option right now..."

jackrussellterrier,2qh0zq,dizzle67,2,Fri Dec 26 20:40:57 2014 UTC,"First, make sure you check with the Vet before abruptly stopping medication. Sometimes they need to be weaned off and could cause more problems if they are not. My 8 year old JRT has battled allergies during the warm season for the past 3 years. Our Vet prescribed Prednisone during the allergy season to ease her suffering. Turned out it only made things worse and caused liver issues. It took a month of strong antibiotics and liver supplement to bring her liver back under control along with a severe case of Pancreatitis. We fed her twice a day with a mixture of white rice and chicken breast. My advice to you is to have a liver panel ran to see if her enzymes are high.  This may be contributing to her condition. Watch what she eats. Supervise her when she is outdoors and don't let her run freely. She may be eating something that is affecting her. Grass, feces, etc. Keep a daily log for your vet of when your JRT eats, what is eaten, what medicine is given, goes to the bathroom (and the consistency), and overall mood (Playful, Lethargic, depressed, etc). Consider an ultrasound and/or X-ray as well. I know these are costly procedures but they should get you the answers you need. Ours is back to normal now after a stressful couple of months. Good luck!!!"
jackrussellterrier,2qh0zq,izadraidz,1 point,Sat Dec 27 00:12:09 2014 UTC,"My JRT, Winston, has been diagnosed with dermatitis. There is no dog in his linage with the same issue. I found that the numbing shampoo the vet prescribed made his skin worse, so now I use avoderm. The thing that improved his skin the most was switching him to a grain free diet. I saw almost immediate improvements. He does great until he has extended play time on grass, which had led me to believing he is allergic to it. I have found two lotions to work on him, one is an infant lotion I found at whole foods, and the other is bag balm. Bag balm is oily, but relives him almost instantly."
jackrussellterrier,2qh0zq,Lazy_Gremlin,1 point,Sat Dec 27 00:13:21 2014 UTC,"We have a 9 or 10 year old Parson Russell.  She had a smooth coat and a rough/broken coat parent and has a really cool combination of both coats.  Around her 2nd birthday she started itching heavily and losing fur.  She had multiple sores from biting, scratching, and rubbing.  We were with a really good vet at the time who put her on an antihistamine and steroid.  While it helped reduce her symtoms, it didn't completely remove them.  Unfortunately, everybody believed it was the best we could do for her.  We even had to fight a few staph infections during those years.  A couple years after that we moved to another area and changed vets.  The doc was an older gent and was really interested in finding out why our pup was so itchy.  We opted for the allergy tests and discovered she was allergic to damn near everthing.  Lamb, rice, house flies, wool, timothy hay, and a number of other things.  We immediately switched her diet (thank goodness grain-free has become non-prescription in recent years...), swapped out her bed for something that was 100% cotten instead of the warmer wool blend we had for her, and she was put on desensitization shots that lasted about 12-18 months.  While Penny isn't symptom-free now, she is much better.  She is also off of all medication (except for really bad days) which is much healthier for her (steroids can be hard on the body when given over years and years).  Allergy testing isn't a bad idea if you're seeing persistant problems.  You could be exposing your pup to all types of evils (like we were) while meaning well."
jackrussellterrier,2qh0zq,BanditMcDougal,1 point,Sat Dec 27 16:15:03 2014 UTC,My jrt had a really bad run with itchiness earlier this year.  She would scratch and bite until her fur was gone in spots and her skin was raw.  Baby benadryl didn't really do anything.  Someone online reccomended trying earthbound oatmeal and aloe shampoo... Almost instantly she was no longer scratching or biting.  It's the only shampoo I use in her now and she hasn't had any issues since. I was really surprised that something as simple as a shampoo could take care of it. I would continue working with your vet but for just ~$10 I'd absolutely give it a shot.
jackrussellterrier,2qh0zq,chipandpeach,1 point,Sat Dec 27 16:19:10 2014 UTC,"My JRT charlie had been itching quite a bit on the rear of his back near his tail.  He would scratch so much that it would scab and he would lose hair, my guess was allergies.  I tried shampoos and stuff to no avail, however I also had been getting dry skin under my beard and I did some research to find a way to solve the issue.  Coconut oil worked perfect, all natural, smells good and moisturizes the skin while keeping the hair nice and healthy.  I tried it on charlie and it worked perfect, no more itching, and it healed up fast."

jackrussellterrier,2pou9u,treacledormouse,1 point,Thu Dec 18 20:24:07 2014 UTC,"She is! She's a bit of a genetic anomaly. She has a 5 generation 'champion' pedigree, was supposed to be broken coated and a true tri-color. Well, she's a smooth coat dilute (or blue) tricolor.  She's also got the ""dilute alopecia"" and her gray spots are almost totally bald, luckily it's not too noticeable. She's 3.5 and still looks pretty much like a puppy to me."

jackrussellterrier,2phn3x,6spdvtec,5,Tue Dec 16 18:09:27 2014 UTC,He was the runt of the litter when I got him but I had no idea his legs would be so short when he was fully grown (a little over 9 lbs). He's a cool little guy nonetheless.   Has anyone else seen a JRT with such short legs?
jackrussellterrier,2phn3x,WinifredBarkle,2,Tue Dec 16 18:12:24 2014 UTC,"If you google ""shorty jack"" you'll see dogs with similar statures. I've also heard them called Irish Jack or Russell terrier, though I'm not exactly sure what the breed standards are. My mom has one and his name is, appropriately, Shorty."
jackrussellterrier,2phn3x,Game25900,1 point,Tue Dec 16 19:42:49 2014 UTC,"I did some research when I first noticed he wasn't a standard JRT. I thought he might be a JRT/Corgi mix. I came across shorty (sometimes called ""puddin"") jacks and he fits the bill, but I guess he's on the smaller end of the spectrum. His parents both have shortish legs but they are about 20lbs."
jackrussellterrier,2phn3x,NotKay,1 point,Tue Dec 16 22:07:54 2014 UTC,"I'd say Corgi is a fair guess as to what he may be crossed with, with the (adorable) stumpy legs and pointy ears, his face is a bit more corgi like too, a bit thinner and pointier.   You also mentioned he was the runt so it's understandable for him to be smaller than his parents, although I'd get check ups with the vets once in a while just to make sure his small size isn't causing any problems."

jackrussellterrier,2ojrdu,lendaclue,3,Sun Dec 7 16:22:57 2014 UTC,Just let the cat whack her a couple times- she'll get the message.
jackrussellterrier,2ojrdu,C_Brooks11,2,Sun Dec 7 14:21:47 2014 UTC,"Probably not a good idea. Cats have claws, which are often tainted with cat droppings, and they tend to go for the eyes with their claws. So, unless you want your puppy to get an infected eye and potentially lose it, don't follow this guys advice.   I had the same situation when I got my first JRT puppy. The cat didn't like to play with the puppy, so when the cat had had enough, he would just get himself to someplace out of the puppies reach (usually up high) and that would be the end of it. If your cat has no such place to go, you might want to get a cat tree for him."

If your grandma is set on a jack try to find a senior one that is on the calmer side. Good luck!"
jackrussellterrier,2ogrz8,Granlukas,4,Sat Dec 6 16:06:55 2014 UTC,"This, Op.  It's a REALLY BIG BUT.  jrt are incredibly energetic and really need a ton of stimulation to avoid destructive behavior."

I love my jack, but now that I'm not on a farm anymore I could never see myself getting another.  He ran around for like 4 hours a day and would still come home and run around more and destroyed everything in the house if we weren't watching him every second.  This was with a lot of training, too....he was the only one out of his litter that didn't have any human aggression.  Still has some dog aggression, even after all that socializing (there were other dogs with him all those hours, he grew up with other dogs in the house).  They are 100% not lap dogs for older women, they are working dogs that need a purpose."
jackrussellterrier,2ogrz8,scomperpotamus,5,Sun Dec 7 02:59:25 2014 UTC,Noooo I would never wish my Jack on an older person. I can barely keep up with him myself.

jackrussellterrier,2ogrz8,gwenmom,3,Sun Dec 7 12:46:06 2014 UTC,"Don't get a puppy. We got our JRT at the local humane society, he had been picked up as a stray and never claimed. There are lots of breed rescue groups, depending on where you or grandma live. I can only second what everyone else is saying: They need a LOT of exercise. Ours plays flyball, walks an hour or two per day off leash in the woods and loves it when he gets to run through the woods chasing the mountain bike. Sedate leash walking will not meet a terrier's exercise needs.   If you get a young dog, grandma should consider day care for the dog or hiring someone to exercise it, maybe take it to the dog park for an hour if it gets along with other dogs.   Try this group: http://www.russellrescue.com/ to see what they have in your area. Or google jack russell rescue (your state) and see what you get.The rescue groups have dogs in foster care, so they will know whether they are housebroken, trained, OK with a senior lifestyle, etc. Also if there are younger grandchildren or some great-grandchildren involved she'll need a dog that will tolerate children.  good luck! and thanks for helping your grandma and considering a rescue dog"

jackrussellterrier,2o3x2j,kilmore_trout,2,Wed Dec 3 01:35:30 2014 UTC,I was going to say pitbull but that's too big. I think our pit and jrt have their sizes backwards.  But our pit is 100% dependant on jrt. They love each other.  Our jrt also gets along really with a schnoodle. She really gets along with every dog but a little overbearing for some shy dogs.  I would def recommend something with a little more energy.
jackrussellterrier,2o3x2j,bamstout,1 point,Fri Dec 5 06:16:36 2014 UTC,"I have a JRT and a Pit as well, and it sounds like a similar dynamic as yours. The JRT is definitely the boss, and the better watchdog! The Pit would happily help any robber if it meant he got to lick someone new. Meanwhile, the Jack sees a pinecone fall into our yard and he goes ballistic (""Oh hell no! They're invading! All pinecones must die!!"") I think the JRT's energy and spunk makes them a good match for bigger dogs. But since OP is space limited, maybe a medium-small sturdy dog, like a corgi or mini schnauzer as an above poster mentioned, would be a good match."

But he does have some similar qualities, all of his life(won't walk/run without giving up quickly, can't let him off leash, solves puzzles easily). What gets him going is using a chew bone of some sort (Nyla is what we have) and dragging it across the floor in front of him in irregular patterns. I guess it simulates a vermin of some sort to him, and it turns on his hunting instinct. However, beware of your arms and hands, because as you drag it he will grab at you trying to stop you while trying to take the bone. We drag it around and around and he loves it."

jackrussellterrier,2mh8d0,gwenmom,2,Mon Nov 17 00:35:29 2014 UTC,"My mom did low-level agility with her JRT. Her favorite thing EVER was jumping, so we started training her at home to jump over a broom handle. Once we got into formal classes, her favorite thing to do would be to complete her course, and then jump over every jump again instead of returning to my mom like she was supposed to. Everyone loved her. For reference, she was a small, shorter legged 12lb JRT.  So it can most certainly be done, but not all dogs are meant for it. My current jack russell LOVES jumping, but is also extremely headstrong and not very easily motivated. After three years I finally managed to teach her ""shake"" a few weeks back (SO EXCITED!) I've also heard of a lot of JRTs who LOVE flyball, but I don't have a club near me."

You could find yourself the victim of a lawsuit, paying someone else's hospital bills, or being forced to get rid of your dog, or all of the above.

Even if you don't have the leash on him, harnesses make it a lot easier to grab onto your dog.   Anything is possible,  but it unlikely you'll ever be able to train a Jack with 100% security to not go after the delivery people. They are so head strong and can be unpredictable even.  My Jack is a total people dog, he loves almost everyone- sometimes even delivery people.  However, he has proven to be unpredictable, like going to the door in total excited but nice mode (tail wagging,  hi-pitched bark, hackles down) then proceeded to fly through the air and rip the glove off of the mail man, and then ripped his shoe before I could get him off.  It was awful. I am totally cautious with everyone now.   I totally feel you on wanting to bring him with you, it sounds great, but I would not risk bringing him without securing him to your desk in the future."

Doesn't growl or bat them away, just goes directly to the nuclear option of pierced lips and bloodshed.   However, I don't want to put you off. Obie came to us as an adult, was never socialized and had a lot of adjusting to do to fit in to our busy life (dogs in and out, activities all the time, hiking with friends who have dogs, etc. etc. chickens cats etc etc it was hard for him).

They were both adopted as puppies and basically love at first sight.   The AS is a male and JRT a female if that has anything to do with it.  They're practically inseparable.

jackrussellterrier,2j9boa,thedeejus,2,Tue Oct 14 22:03:12 2014 UTC,"I actually did put my rescue JRT/beagle mix on Prozac when he was about 6-8 months old because his anxiety was so bad he was injuring himself. The thing you have to remember is that the Prozac is NOT a cure- it simply brings the anxiety down to a level that you can train your dog that whatever the anxiety causing situation is, it is not the end of the world. The con is that it is expensive and if your vet is anything like mine was, they will try to convince you your dog will need it for the rest of its life. This is not true. In my case, we used it for about 2-4 months ( can't remember exactly)- just until we could get the anxiety under control and a routine established and then I slowly weaned him off it. I know it's not for everyone but it literally saved my dog's life."
jackrussellterrier,2j9boa,carmacae,1 point,Wed Oct 15 01:18:26 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the tips.  I never thought I would be the sort of person who would put his dog on prozac, but he literally can't be outside for more than a couple of minutes before something sets him off and i have to drag him inside to calm down, and I just feel like he has a low qualify of life - I can't remember the last time he so much as ran at full speed outside.  At this point I am willing to try anything that might work, but consider drugs a last resort. But it's good to consider them as temporary the way you do, and it makes sense."
jackrussellterrier,2j9boa,carmacae,1 point,Wed Oct 15 03:25:50 2014 UTC,"I completely understand- I am the same way. I tried for so long to do all the desensitization training, etc but in the end, the medicine helped. He is now healthy, happy, and (mostly hah) anxiety free five years later."

jackrussellterrier,2j9boa,pinkyoshi1989,1 point,Wed Oct 15 04:36:46 2014 UTC,But I had a JRTx who was severely anxious. It ruined him in the end. We had the option of prozac but we declined because we didn't want him to be anxious but completely aware of all his triggers. (we didn't research enough obviously). it's not a matter of screwing with their natural behaviors- sure JRT's can run and play for hours but in their head there can be a mis-wire.

Proactive elimination of issues that cause a rise in anxiety   Each and every one of these tactics can help your pups issue.
jackrussellterrier,2j9boa,Ilikedogs29,2,Tue Oct 14 22:45:00 2014 UTC,Ive been meaning to get him a thundershirt - I hear that for some dogs it's like flipping a light switch.

She had one other sibling with similar marking and the others were black/brown (think rottie markings). Parents unknown. To me, she shows signs of being a JRT aside from her tall, skinny 36 lb frame. She is extremely hyper, loves to run, and chase/be chased. She's also a little overly anxious and pants as soon as anything exciting or scary is happening. She's extremely loving even though she doesn't always like to cuddle. She is kind of cat like in that aspect. She's a picky eater at times even with treats. Do you guys think she's mostly JRT?

jackrussellterrier,2hfsc3,thedeejus,3,Thu Sep 25 15:39:34 2014 UTC,You need to get a big crate to keep him in.  He wont poop while he is in there.  JRT are big assholes and poop just because you left him at home alone.  Basically as soon as you get home throw him out of the cage and outside to go poop.  Do this every day until he gets the point.
jackrussellterrier,2hfsc3,xcomv01,1 point,Thu Sep 25 19:35:04 2014 UTC,you know the crate thing is relative. I used to keep one of my dogs (not a JRT) in a crate because she was very destructive and she would still poop/pee in the crate regardless of my time away. Sometimes I would be gone all day at work (9 hours including commute) and she would be nice and clean. Other times I'd be gone a shorter time and there would be a mess. And yes I would let her out beforehand and the crate was only big enough to let spin around before lying down. Hated that damn thing. Thankfully now we have a yard for them to be free in.

I only want what's best for you two. Firstly you need to walk your JRT a lot.  A lot.    My JRT is almost six and up until he was 5 I was a shitty owner in some ways.  Mine would pee in corners that he thinks I didn't see and he would take a dump anywhere that had carpet.   But.   I started walking him every single day.  No matter what.  Even 20 minutes around the EDIT: I want to finish this comment but my iPad keeps crashing.    I will finish it tomorrow at my desk computer - sorry! Thanks !"

jackrussellterrier,2gqayn,funkyChicken82,3,Thu Sep 18 05:00:05 2014 UTC,"Another comment about their intelligence. My last service dog was a JRT, and he was my pet before he was ever doing any working dog stuff ... his intelligence got him into all kinds of trouble before it ever worked to my benefit! Really keep an eye to ""child-proofing"" your dog's environment. Mine learned to open the car windows himself, escape from his car seatbelt, escape from his harness if I tried to tie him up outside and step into a building for 2 seconds without him (he'd come in and ""find me,"" so pleased with himself for rescuing me, lol), and would eat just about anything which got poison control on my speed dial.    This toy is pricey but was far and away the best at keeping his mind engaged for more than 3 seconds. There are different variations you can do with it to increase the difficulty once they figure it out, too. Also popular among the two JRTs I've had have been those balls they have to kick around that will occasionally drop one or two kibbles out as they roll. The downside is that they're loud on your hardwood floors and get wedged under furniture, which will frustrate the hell out of the dog.  I hope that helps some. Have fun with your new buddy!"

I've had him for a couple months now (crazy, I feel like I've had him way longer) but he's never gone to the bathroom in the house, he doesn't bark, and he's the friendliest dog to every other person and animal he meets. And he is very mellow!  It's weird not knowing what the last 8 years of his life have been, except for knowing that he's been abandoned twice. I wonder if he was ever hyper, and how long it took him to be potty trained, and if he grew up with other animals?

jackrussellterrier,2gd1av,Lundix,7,Sun Sep 14 11:28:06 2014 UTC,"The JRTCA was established to preserve the hunting instincts and physical capabilities of the dog with less priority on actual physical height and size. There is a standard but it includes both long - legged and shortie types. This club is in no way affiliated with the AKC (which, IMO, appears to be doing exactly what the JRTCA anticipated:  destroying the hunting instincts of the breed in favor of creating a cookie - cutter ""type""). Jack Russells originated as vermin hunters and companions, not show dogs. Look to the origins of the breed, don't let a dog show teach you about dogs.  www.therealjackrussell.com"
jackrussellterrier,2gd1av,bubonictonic,2,Sun Sep 14 14:52:37 2014 UTC,"American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes two different breeds:   The Parson Russell Terrier, which is the long legged version.   And the Jack Russell Terrier, which is the short legged version.   The CKC, which is the 2nd largest kennel club in the US, calls both the short legged and long legged versions Jack Russell Terriers.   In England they call both types of dogs Russell Terriers. They also do not dock tails.    You cannot go wrong with either type. The leg length is really the only difference. I would suspect the long legged version (Parson Russell) would be a better hunting dog."

Small body to get through the tight trails and the long legs help on jumping up in high rock situations.  Added bonus, small dogs don't require a lot of water on trails which means less weight you have to carry.  Mine hikes off leash on deserted trails and never strays far ahead.  She's even sniffed out trails that had poor markers and kept our group on the designated trail.  I don't have a lot of experience with the other two that you mentioned, but my PRT is an awesome dog.

jackrussellterrier,2g6erd,HyePhilosopher,2,Fri Sep 12 06:00:12 2014 UTC,"Two words: puppy pads! Crate training is wonderful! Lyla will whine, but it will eventually become one of her favorite places to go. Just be sure never to use the crate as negative reinforcement, or else she will think the crate is more of a punishment, rather than a safe haven. JRTs are highly intelligent, yet incredibly active dogs. You'll need to provide her with plenty of exercise and mental stimulation, like KONGs and treats for good behavior. Put a puppy pad in your home and begin to move it closer and closer to the door she'll be going out of to go to the bathroom. Once she's ready, start moving the used puppy pads outside; this way, she'll associate the smell of urine and/or feces with being outdoors and not indoors. Also, good luck!"
jackrussellterrier,2g6erd,stephydee123,1 point,Fri Sep 12 15:36:42 2014 UTC,"Congrats on the new puppy! My JRT is 10 months old and I got him when he was a wee little one, around 2-3 months old.     Do you have a dog bed? That's what mine slept in/sleeps in now most days and he loves it. Dogs tend to want to be near their owners, so I set my pups bed on the floor right next to the bed. I also put some old sheets down around and a fleece blanket down incase he decides to sleep on the floor. To get him to sleep there, just lead her there and give her a treat. I would say ""lay down"" and give him a treat to associate it with the command.   She may wander (mine did for a few nights), but she'll go back to sleep. She won't get lost.  Whining for what? It depends. If she is whining for a toy because it's somewhere she can't reach, get it for her. If she's whining because she wants food, don't give in!   You can start training now! What i did was just look up online what I wanted to teach my pup and followed the directions. It's easier when they are younger."

I was pad training him and when he didn't pee on the pad, I would scold him, when he peed on the pad, I gave him one little treat. It didn't take long for him to pee exclusively on the pad at night and during the day when I was at work. I combined this with going outside every 2-3 hours (1 hour added for every month) and giving treats when he did his business outside. I don't have a yard as I live in an apartment, so it took us probably a bit longer to get potty training done right, but now he holds it all night."

jackrussellterrier,2eeo8m,wish_you_were_here,3,Sun Aug 24 00:35:35 2014 UTC,"I feel your frustration. We adopted a JRT mix from a local shelter that was a stray.  This was a year ago. The last 2 months,  I've come home to find she's peed in her crate almost every afternoon.  She makes it through the night just fine,  I go to work around 7:20 and usually get home at 12:30 for lunch and she's dry.  Then coming home at the end of the day 3 1/2 hours later he total is wet and not warm like it was excitement that I was home but like it had been there a while.  She has also started peeing in the house even after having peed outside in the last hour.  Took her to the vet and they found she had a UTI ,  but we finished the needs a week ago and there's really no improvement.    I'm going to get her in the vet again next week but I'm so frustrated at this point I don't really know what else to try.  She didn't do this when we brought her home not when my wife's job took her 12 hours away and let us here.  We have an older fox Terrier (12 years old to the estimated 5 years old for our JRT) and they get along fine."
jackrussellterrier,2eeo8m,Cymbrogi,2,Sun Aug 24 03:00:53 2014 UTC,Yea!! Mickey is well socialized with our cats as well. He's a happy dog... He just ... Does this!  I'm so afraid the point is coming where my husband will be at his limit. He's already planning to replace baseboard heating before This winter bc the dog had peed in them last year... And we will need to replace carpets too.  He's at his wits end and therefore so am I. Having to balance our love for our pet with the rest of our life.. Its so hard.
jackrussellterrier,2eeo8m,SnZ001,3,Sun Aug 24 03:17:09 2014 UTC,"Our BoJack, Carly, is just about to turn 2 years old, and I would have to say that housebreaking her was definitely a bit more challenging than any of my previous dogs.  That combination of inherent stubbornness and the insatiable desire to eat everything(plus all that energy and a high metabolism) can make controlling where and when they decide to relieve themselves a little more difficult.  A few really common but crucial tips(Quick disclaimer: I'm in no way an animal professional of any kind, just a mid-30's dog owner who's had about four or five dogs throughout my life.  If any actual qualified vets/trainers/professionals want to weigh in here and offer corrections/additions to any of this, please do, as I would absolutely yield to your expertise & much more extensive experience):   Adhere strictly to specific feeding/elimination times.  The more regular his eating times are, the more regular(and predictable) his daily elimination times will start to become.  Of course, he's gonna get treats(and if he's like our little scavenger, the occasional bug or a few blades of grass from the yard, which can only really be curtailed so much with these little sneak-a-roos!), but for his main meal(s), try to give the exact same size portions at the exact same times every day, and take him outside to the same spot at the same times when you want him to go.  It will never be an exact science, and there will always be times when all that crazy energy and those wonderful outside smells will just be too overwhelming for our little impulse-control-challenged everything-eaters, and you take them out and they just don't want to take care of business because they're too busy jumping after butterflies, but be patient and consistent regardless.  Also, don't take him out too often.  You don't just want him to learn to eliminate outside instead of inside, you also need him to let you know when he needs to do so.  He won't do this unless he feels a sense of urgency because he actually has to go.  You have to find a balance between taking him out every half hour because you're paranoid that he'll go on the carpet if you don't, and not taking him out at all because you expect him to figure out on his own that he needs to come and tell you.  Once in the morning, once before bed, and once or twice during the day/evening is usually a good number. Be immediate and consistent with both reprimands and rewards. This can be really demanding of your time and attention, but you've got to keep a very close eye on him at ALL times for a while, until you are convinced that he's got it down.  Because it's absolutely essential that you only yell at him when you see him starting to assume the position to eliminate.  Even 3 minutes after the fact, once you've made your way into that room that he wandered into while you were watching TV is already too late for yelling or correction, because he won't make the connection by that point.  And the ol' ""shove his nose in it"" approach is really just going to cause more confusion than anything.  You have to catch him at the moment he's starting to squat, verbally correct him with an ""UH-UH!"" or a ""NO!"" and then immediately pick him up and take him to the place where you want him to go.  Again, consistency is key here.  It's even a good idea to take him to the same exact spot in the yard, so that he better associates that specific place with the specific desired behavior.   Choose one room which can be cordoned off and be willing to sacrifice that room for accidents(which will inevitably happen) while you're out/asleep.  Because, let's face it, the essential problem that we all have is that, while we understand that we need to correct the behavior at the time it's happening, the reality is that we just can't be there, ready to swoop him up every second of the day.  We have jobs, we have to sleep, and sometimes, we just need a break.  But as much as we don't want to have to confine our little furbabies, we can't have them destroying our homes every time we go out for a couple of hours or waking up to stink bombs in the living room in the morning, either.  So pick one(relatively but not ridiculously) small room - one without carpet is obviously the best choice here - and make it his designated room for whenever you can't have eyes on him.  Never reprimand him for an accident which occurs in this room UNLESS you happen to see him while he's doing it, and then, again, immediately pick him up and take him out to his spot.  Carly is spoiled, so we put a baby gate up in the doorway so that she can still see(or at least, in her little head, be closer to) us whenever she has to be in her room, which nowadays is usually only when we have company over.  It helps with her abandonment issues, and will help keep your carpets from getting ruined without having to completely sequester him away into a room behind a closed door.  Totally locking him away can be scary and could make him feel like he's being punished, which is not the point of the room. Positive reinforcement is just as important as negative reinforcement.  Make sure you're rewarding him(read:treats) - or, at the very least, praising him - each and every time immediately after he relieves himself outside in his spot, whether it's his designated time or (fingers crossed) he actually asks you to let/take him out.  Again, consistency is crucial here.  There has to be two distinct messages that he's learning: 1. If I do my business outside, a good thing happens to happen to me EVERY TIME(like treats or tickles).  2.  If I do my business inside, a bad thing happens to me EVERY TIME(like getting yelled at and no tickles or treats).  And did I mention that consistency is crucial here? Well, it really, really is, especially since we're talking about a JRT here.  These guys are known gamblers and will take calculated risks.  I've heard that some electric fence installers will flat out refuse to install them in yards for JRT owners, because a JRT can run into it once, get shocked, decide that, meh, it's worth the jolt to get to the other side, back up 10', and then and charge at it full-speed - not only rendering the whole point of the fence moot, but also(over repeated occurrences, esp.) potentially causing serious harm to the dog.  So, if they think there's even a chance they won't get caught in the act and punished(and again, the times he got yelled at after-the-fact will not factor into his odds calculation process, because he never even made the connection between that reprimand and the thing he did to invoke it), he'll press his luck and go for it.  So it's all about incentive/motivation.  Ideally, you want him to eventually get to a place where he a. loves and does not want to displease you AND b. clearly understands that doing business inside displeases you.  For now, though, you're going to have to help him make that connection through repetition while providing him some extra incentive to want to keep playing along and learning the routine.   Be extremely patient.  Remember that he's not a bad dog, he just has a behavior pattern that needs to be reconditioned.  You're both going to need to stick at this for a good while in order to recondition bad habits and routines that it sounds like were already well-formed long before you adopted him.  That's going to take mind-numbing repetitiveness and clockwork consistency.  Dogs(especially JRTs) need routine and consistency in their daily lives.  We have to provide as much regularity to their regiment as we can, and it doesn't sound like he had a whole lot of that in his life before you guys came along.  It's going to take time and reps and more time and more reps to undo a pattern that likely went unchecked throughout the most formative period of his puppyhood, but it can absolutely be done - as long as he's given the proper encouragement and supervision.   Best of luck, and I hope that you can both stick it out with him - I'm willing to bet he's worth it!"
jackrussellterrier,2eeo8m,WinifredBarkle,1 point,Sun Aug 24 04:02:39 2014 UTC,Oh he's def worth it. And he does love us.. I know he does. It seems like he truly can't figure out that we don't want him doing it.  Its so random and not at all malicious...  I have seen that calculates risk taking though lol.... He can be a little shit when he wants to...  But this is truly a lack of communication. I can't figure out how to make him see and he's just not even aware that it's a problem no matter what I say or do.  Thank you so much for the feedback. We will be trying really hard to integrate as much consistent good behavior as possible.
jackrussellterrier,2eeo8m,WinifredBarkle,2,Sun Aug 24 04:16:59 2014 UTC,"While this is not the most helpful comment I just want you to know: You are not alone.  My mom currently has 3 JRTs and the two males (both neutered) pee and mark in the house. She ended up buying male diapers for them. It has helped keep the mess down, but she still has problems. Both have been tested by the vet and there's nothing wrong- they're just being dicks.  I have a 3 year old female (spayed) that also has issues, especially at night. We've taken her to the vet, tested for UTIs, looked for abnormalities and they thought she was having spay incontinence and would need daily meds for the rest of her life. But after testing, it ends up that no, she's just an asshole.  Moral: Know your breed. They are very willful dogs and need strong motivation and a consistent owner to succeed. As much as I hate the pee issues, she's still my pup and I'll bear with it."
jackrussellterrier,2eeo8m,WinifredBarkle,1 point,Sun Aug 24 03:26:30 2014 UTC,We adopted him for reasons apart from his breeding. I knew he would be a handful.  In every other aspect of life I like his willful personality.... I didn't expect this problem to go on this long. :(.  How do you put up with the damage the urine would do around the house?? I am cleaning like 8 days a week here... And as soon as we have a little humidity my house stinks like dog pee.  One of my concerns is that other JRT owners have confirmed that it seems to be a common problem with them. Its disheartening.
jackrussellterrier,2eeo8m,morganah,2,Sun Aug 24 03:34:55 2014 UTC,"It's definitely disheartening. My girl has attitude problems too and I've raised her from a puppy. She's currently sleeping in a ball next to me as cute as you please. She also jumps fences and can run 20 miles in a day and ask ""WHY DID WE STOP?!""  First off, Cleaning. Having the correct cleaners and techniques is key. For fabrics/carpet I recommend Anti-Icky Poo It's an enzymatic cleaner. It's expensive but it works. If not this, than use Nature's Miracle.  Technique: for carpet, soak up as much as you can (paper towel, or cloth towel), spray enough enzymatic cleaner to saturate, scrub lightly. Let it sit for awhile, then soak up any excess. Ensure you're getting cleaner down to the carpet padding. Invest in a home steam cleaner. Mine has worked miracles. Other good products are OxyClean based cleaners (or better yet, dissolve the powder in scortching hot water). Do the same for any furniture (the furniture attachment on my Bissell steam cleaner has saved my couches).  Other than that is prevention. Only let him have water during certain times of the day when you can watch him closely for the next hour. Do not let him have water for an hour or two before he's crated. Talk to your vet about this. Mine recommended it after our many issues, but it does go against the typical recommendation of always leaving clean cool water available.  Also, redirecting them the split second he lifts his leg is key. This might mean tying a leash around your waist for the next month and not letting him leave your sight. It sucks. Trust me. We've had a recent regression so currently Lyra does not leave my site unless she is crated or outside.  You just have to out-stubborn your dog. These issues are sadly common, but she's my pup...  Bonus pic of her cuddling with our latest foster dog this weekend!"
jackrussellterrier,2eeo8m,Dam_Kids,2,Sun Aug 24 03:52:32 2014 UTC,"Lol! She's adorable. I am thinking about tethering him until we speak with the behaviorist ...

If you feel you have tried everything perhaps he needs checking by a vet to make sure it is a behaviour and not a physical problem?   Does he actually wee outside?  If so, when he does, reward him and attach a command to the action, just like when teaching to sit or stay or whatever. But you need to catch him weeing outside ( or where ever it is you want him to go) so even if it means standing outside for an hour it's worth it now for the long term benefit."
jackrussellterrier,2eeo8m,Priteegrl,1 point,Sun Aug 24 10:03:08 2014 UTC,He goes outside yep.. And then he'll come inside and be fine for a bit but if the urge to go comes up again... He will just hop off the couch and go find a spot without alerting us. Aside from continually walking him and getting lucky... We have had zero control over his elimination habits.
jackrussellterrier,2eeo8m,dlcjr1775,2,Sun Aug 24 14:15:14 2014 UTC,Have you taken him to a vet to make sure he doesn't have a UTI or anything like that? Not sure really what else to suggest. I was lucky with mine. She only went inside 1 or 2 times the day I got her and after taking her out every hour or 2 for a few days she never has again in 3+ years.
jackrussellterrier,2eeo8m,ritzcracka,1 point,Sun Aug 24 05:14:35 2014 UTC,He has been to the vet routinely... This behavior is not new. He's been this way for two years regardless of being sick or well.  Right now he's nursing some sort of stomach thing that may be the result of garbage eating...or bug eating..or any of a million other things...  But this peeing in the house is ever present.

And with towels laid down for him to pee on. He currently will pee out through the bars of the cage at night and when we are gone. We keep the crate on linoleum bc it's a daily clean up. He just seems to have no concept of holding it in. When he needs to go he just goes. Sometimes we get lucky and catch him before he does.

She also has 2 modes asleep and 100mph and nothing in between.  All in all an awesome girl and I wouldn't change her for the world :P"

jackrussellterrier,2cw50o,ppoppers,5,Fri Aug 8 12:36:43 2014 UTC,"Do you really not take the dog into consideration at all? It's not about you and your preferences, it's about casually cutting a body part off an animal we/you/I supposedly love."
jackrussellterrier,2cw50o,thisrockismyboone,0,Fri Aug 8 12:44:58 2014 UTC,"Yes? When they are very young they don't have nerve endings in the tail so it does not hurt to remove it. Also having a shorter tail does absolutely nothing to affect a dog's life. If anything, it makes it safer because it doesn't have a big waving appendage to get snagged, stepped on, bit by other dogs, or hurt in some other way."

jackrussellterrier,2co4xj,Adddicus,2,Tue Aug 5 14:14:25 2014 UTC,"Jack Russells usually have strong hunting instincts, and this often leads them to try to cover up their own scent, usually by rolling in the foulest smelling thing they can find. And they can find plenty.  I used to have a small river in my backyard (I moved, its still there) and had my property lined with invisible fence so the dogs had the run of the place, and they had a ball. Barely a day would pass when they couldn't find something awful smelling to roll in. They got a lot of baths. Fortunately they are small dogs, easy to bathe and trusting enough to be lured into the bathroom with a treat."

If you averted your eyes, she'd get up and move back into your line of sight and continue staring.  They're just a little crazy, but usually in very amusing ways. You'll get used to it."
jackrussellterrier,2cmctu,Adddicus,1 point,Mon Aug 4 21:13:59 2014 UTC,"Not that this is necessarily your situation, but my JRT had serious alpha dog problems when he was younger and would do something similar. In a dogs mind, staring is a way to show domination and whoever averts their gaze first loses. Now it wasn't so much a problem for me, but my dog used to try to do this to my mom and would then go piss on her bed. It wasn't until we realized what was going on that we were able to fix it."

My wife and I rescued a JRT that one of our neighbor's abandoned (kicked the poor little guy out of the house and moved away). He was, far and away, the most laid back, easiest going, best behaved dog I've ever had. He had the sweetest disposition and got along withe every person he ever met, and every dog except one (Mitch, a mangy looking thing that roamed free in the neighborhood... don't know what bad blood there was between the two, but when my dog, Chance, saw Mitch, he'd go absolutely frothing-at-the-mouth, bat-shit, berzerk).

Now we aren't sure because her fur is all very soft and short, her ears are huge and stick straight up, and compared to other jack Russell's she is very tiny. We think maybe she's mixed with toy fox or rat terrier?"
jackrussellterrier,2atl16,lendaclue,3,Wed Jul 16 02:13:00 2014 UTC,"Some JRTs have smooth coats, so that's normal.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Russell_Terrier#mediaviewer/File:JackRussells.jpg  But in the first 2 two pictures her face looke a bit too 'wide'. So i wouldn't be surprised if she wasn't 100% JRT (maybe some bull terrier in there?). On the other hand she looks exactly like my parents' JRT in the last picture!"
jackrussellterrier,2atl16,sammiekitteh,3,Wed Jul 16 06:53:21 2014 UTC,"Her ears make me think that she might be part rat terrier, but aside from the ears everything looks JRT. I have a smooth coat JRT (I knew the breeder and have papers so I know he's pure Jack) so the soft short coat isn't too much of a sign of another breed."
jackrussellterrier,2atl16,PotatosAreDelicious,2,Wed Jul 16 15:31:21 2014 UTC,Aww she's adorable. I'd say she looks sort of like my dog in the face. Your story is kinda the opposite to mine. My little jack/chihuahua/yorkie looks 100% jack but we are told that her parents are mixed! It's really strange. She's just got really long legs and a chihuahua like face.

My first JRT was sometimes left home alone, not very often since I worked days and my wife worked nights. She grew out of the destructive behavior, but when she was a pup she destroyed our sofa, some of the molding along the wall, the wall itself, pulled up carpet and had a daily feast with the mail until I took measures to stop it.  Once we moved out of our apartment and got our own house, we installed a doggy door and an invisible fence, so she pretty much got to go in and out at her leisure. We lived in a fairly rural area along the banks of a small river, and she had a blast hunting (and often catching) all the wild life that would come into our yard. Never really had any destruction related problems once she could get her aggressive instincts exercised."

Twice we changed it to something cheaper and both times his stomach couldn't handle it. Apparently it's quite common for mostly white dogs to have food sensitivities and skin allergies.
jackrussellterrier,27n2i0,morganah,3,Sun Jun 8 21:49:19 2014 UTC,"We had been feeding Taste of the Wild, but switches 6 months ago to 4Health brand from Tractor Supply.

All for ~$30 per 35 lb bag on sale."

But she has dry chicken biscuits which were recommended by the vet, and the RSPCA trainer said they are good as well.   She also LOVES pigs ears so she gets one of those every two or three days.   I did get some raw chicken meat preparation which is in the freezer but I keep forgetting to take it out to thaw. Plus the RSPCA said that the dry food is much better for her."
jackrussellterrier,27n2i0,Tsubaki-d,2,Sun Jun 8 23:56:34 2014 UTC,Solid Gold Hund-n-Flocken. There are a lot of good foods out there but they're not the cheap ones. I primarily look for whole meat as the first and primary ingredient and no corn.  This website is a good resource to look for good foods http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/ but they get a little stupid with some ingredient criticisms. I'd think any four star food is probably a good option.
jackrussellterrier,27n2i0,kwadra,2,Mon Jun 9 01:15:52 2014 UTC,"My dog gets a healthy mix of Orijen (kibble), Primal Pet Foods (Raw frozen patties/nuggets), and occasionally I throw in a raw egg.

I wouldn't buy anything bigger than the 30 pound bag, not sure a Jack can go through a big bag before it seems to go stale (even stored in an airtight container).  There's also a good amount of people food thrown in the mix. Eggs, steak trimmings, bits of apple, etc. Most of that stuff makes him fart up a storm though."

jackrussellterrier,27jvev,atalossofwords,4,Sat Jun 7 15:08:57 2014 UTC,"The shedding thing is difficult. At least with my short haired jacks, not many brushes pick up the hair well. We have the best luck with using a flea comb in the bath to remove large amounts. But even after that they still shed... It's a way of life lol.   As for food, I would minimize human food. My dogs will get some yogurt, baby carrots, green beans, or a small table scrap on occasion in small amounts, but they eat mostly dog food. Dog food has been formulated to include everything your dog needs whereas human food may be severely lacking in certain nutrients.   On that line though, you don't want to stress her out either. Dogs are prone to stress diarrhea when in a new place and that's not good either. Depending on how long you have her for, you can play around with what seems to work best for her, while keeping her healthy.   Also feel free to share a picture with the group! We always love seeing each other's JRTs!"

jackrussellterrier,26oiuw,xcomv01,6,Wed May 28 08:38:00 2014 UTC,Go meet her and check for behavior problems.  I say this because a poorly trained JRT can be a nuisance. Beyond that they are great dogs.
jackrussellterrier,26oiuw,jblue68,4,Wed May 28 12:58:46 2014 UTC,"I would be wary that she is not properly house-trained, JRT's can sometimes get in the habit of hiding to potty.   An under-exercised Jack can also get destructive. If you go to the house look for chewed baseboard, pillows etc.  Neither of these problems would be impossible to correct, but would take a lot of diligence.  My JRT's are happy with a 45 min. walk a day, plus a couple play sessions. They need mental stimulation as well, so we do 2 training periods of about 15 min. a day. Of course my favourite part of our day is cuddling on the couch, they are great at that!"

We got lucky and have a guy who sleeps whenever he is bored, but they have lots of energy and need to be walked and / or halve lots of outside time to calm them.  Jacks are apparently high on the aggressive dog list, but I figure most of it has to do with training. However, I would see if you can spend time with her just to make sure. Untrained Jacks can be... Pardon me... Total shits... We believe ours was disciplined poorly and reacts violently around feet.   Other than that, Jacks are fun and amazing. :3"

I use this as part of my grooming routine for my Jack; zoom groom, then wire slicker, then furminator.  Rubber brushes loosen the hair with friction, wire slickers get down to the skin (but can easily be overused, causing sensitivity), and the furminator is the finishing touch."

jackrussellterrier,240yzy,Game25900,6,Sat Apr 26 23:48:20 2014 UTC,"Personally I wish the show crowd had never heard of the JRT. Ultimately I think they'll ruin the breed, as they have done to many other breeds of dogs.  Sadly, the AKC recognized the JRT in 1997, and the UKC in 1991. I think the term ""Parson Jack Russell Terrier"" came about as a result of a lawsuit or compromise between the JRT breeders assosciations and the various kennel clubs to differentiate between the JRTs breed for work and the PJRT bred for show. But I am hardly the most informed person on the subject.  I've had three JRTs and fostered half a dozen more, and as far as I'm concerned they're the best dogs ever. I've had many other dogs over the years, but JRTs are far and away my favorites. One of my dogs (Sally by name) beat up and chased away a full grown Rottweiler that was going after my wife. Sally weighed all of 11 pounds. THAT is the kind of spirit that none of us want to see bred out of the dog by the show people."

jackrussellterrier,23txho,Tsubaki-d,5,Thu Apr 24 03:45:31 2014 UTC,Crate training.... I can't stress this enough.  Basically she stays in the crate at night and when you get up she goes straight outside.  Give her a treat when she comes back in.  When you cant monitor her she goes back into the crate and when she comes out she goes straight outside.  Again treat when she comes in.  Be consistent and praise when she goes potty outside.  She will get it.  It just takes some patience and time.  As for keeping them off furniture.... Good luck.  I still haven't figured that one out yet.  Maybe a squirt bottle might work.

More anxious than normal and when she got out, she would explode on everything, jumping on people, furniture, and frantically yapping away. It was literally torture for her. We tried every trick out there to get her to like it and nothing worked. What finally worked was just doggie proofing our bedroom and letting her stay in there. Sure there are a few accidents by the door now and then on extra long days but at least, she is calmer and more accepting of being alone(with dog #2) all day.

jackrussellterrier,22yvi3,BreakforPuppies,2,Mon Apr 14 01:35:36 2014 UTC,"Dogs pant when it's hot out.  If it seems excessive, take her to the vet.  But it's probably fine."
jackrussellterrier,22yvi3,thedeejus,1 point,Mon Apr 14 01:47:35 2014 UTC,"Doesn't sound strange. I noticed that my JRT pants more now that she's older. I feel like she never did as a puppy, she would lay in the sun and seem to never get hot. Now she does though, so it sounds normal to me."
jackrussellterrier,22yvi3,DigitalGoobie,1 point,Mon Apr 14 01:48:39 2014 UTC,"My JRT rarely pants. I have noticed that both of my JRTs get over-heated more easily than other breeds I've had. At least, that's my perception. It wouldn't hurt to take her to the vet if you can afford it. But, I wouldn't be overly worried. Just make sure she always has access to water. If you have a sort of guess at a baseline — how much she was drinking before — you might estimate if she's drinking more now."
jackrussellterrier,22yvi3,AustinTreeLover,1 point,Mon Apr 14 03:28:22 2014 UTC,"My JRT is a short hair. He doesn't pant much unless he's been running laps in the back yard, he will go for hours at a time running  and has actually worn ruts into our yard. It is another of his OCD behaviors. He comes inside every 15 minutes or so to check up on us or get some water and then heads right back out. He also snaps at invisible bugs. chews his paws or butt, rolls around on his back then does an impressive army crawl on the carpet. We think this stuff maybe stems from the fact he is deaf and it has kind of warped him but we love him and he is interesting to watch."
jackrussellterrier,22yvi3,BigdogBob,1 point,Thu Apr 17 21:45:44 2014 UTC,"Panting is not always a sign of being too hot. Dogs can also pant when they are nervous/excited. Seeing as how most JRT's are balls of energy, she might just be excited about whatever. Try to notice what's going when she pants. Mine does it when people come home, at the vet, in the car. Now that I think of it, she pants for just about anything haha."

When I take clothes out of the dryer and go to the back bedroom to fold the clothes, she HAS to have something fresh and warm from the dryer to lay on while she supervises my laundry folding. It could be a washcloth, anything, as long as it's warm and out of the dryer. She also has a weird thing with dryer sheets....LOVES THEM. The weird part is she always rips them into exactly three pieces and the leaves it alone."

jackrussellterrier,22medj,7rider,9,Wed Apr 9 17:25:35 2014 UTC,I thought you weren't supposed to feed dogs uncooked chicken because salmonella and potential to choke on chicken bones.
jackrussellterrier,22medj,bigDdan,3,Wed Apr 9 17:53:49 2014 UTC,"The salmonella is correct, but it is highly unlikely that a dog will choke on raw bone. Generally, it is when a bone is cooked, and splinters in a particular way, that problems can happen. With that said, I wouldn't personally recommend giving a dog a bone, raw or cooked. Even more so, do not ever give a dog raw poultry."
jackrussellterrier,22medj,clutchest_nugget,8,Wed Apr 9 18:04:55 2014 UTC,You should NEVER feed your dog raw chicken. I would provide sources but all you have to do is google it and you will find several articles and forum posts about why this is a terrible idea.
jackrussellterrier,22medj,merchandise91,5,Wed Apr 9 19:33:58 2014 UTC,Your JRT is adorable. But yeah I would recommend finding another treat. I'm not sure about raw chicken bones for sure. But I know that chicken bones tend to splinter and that can be really dangerous for your pets.

jackrussellterrier,2101su,Primrose429,2,Fri Mar 21 20:46:48 2014 UTC,"Yes! You're quite right! She's 7 months old and her hobbie is to destroy everything I own, but looking at her eyes, is just too difficult to blame her for anything! Also is very social and loving. A really beautiful dog.

jackrussellterrier,20uke8,Keyser_Sozay,3,Wed Mar 19 21:46:12 2014 UTC,I wouldn't worry about it much. There isn't much you can do anyways if he is going blind in an eye. Have your vet take a look...  It is probably nothing. JRT are very resilient and bad eye sight will have little effect on their joyful little lives.
jackrussellterrier,20uke8,xcomv01,3,Wed Mar 19 21:59:48 2014 UTC,"I've never seen a ring like you're describing. Usually it is a haze that starts over their pupil (cataract). I would definitely see a vet sooner than later. If it's something like glaucoma, you can fix it before it gets worse.   But this is not the place to search for sound medical advice."
jackrussellterrier,20uke8,WinifredBarkle,1 point,Wed Mar 19 23:47:29 2014 UTC,Thanks. Yeah I planned on taking her to the vet eventually but I wanted to see if anyone here had experienced something similar

jackrussellterrier,20uke8,BlueFoxalope,2,Wed Mar 19 22:56:42 2014 UTC,"Never seen a ring, but my JRT's eyes seem to have become foggy over the last few years and his life pattern has never changed.  Just keep an eye on your pup and see if their pattern of behavior changes."
jackrussellterrier,20rmst,Wuzzie,3,Wed Mar 19 00:23:26 2014 UTC,"I picked him up this Saturday, and i haven´t slept many hours since then. Mostly because i´ve too excited about having him.   So i have myself to blame that he is biting when he gets excited. And the fact that when i finally decide to go to bed, he has been resting already.  I´ve even created a video-channel for him on Vimeo. :)"
jackrussellterrier,20rmst,RotatingMaleCow,1 point,Wed Mar 19 00:27:40 2014 UTC,if you have a staircase and he's down to chase a ball its almost like cheating. i tire out my dude by chucking his ball down the stairs for a while and he'll collapse for bed time.
jackrussellterrier,20rmst,FuzzyHappyBunnies,1 point,Wed Mar 19 07:29:53 2014 UTC,He's still a bit spooked by stairs.  Unless I manage to trick him to not think about them as stairs but just an elevation of the ground. Or let him take the lead. Might try rolling the ball slowly down the steps to see how it goes.

jackrussellterrier,20mzyp,merchandise91,12,Mon Mar 17 16:22:30 2014 UTC,My suggestion is to not wonder why JRT's do the things they do.  It just makes more sense that way.
jackrussellterrier,20mzyp,thedeejus,10,Mon Mar 17 20:03:51 2014 UTC,"My JRT does this with her toys and her chew-things... she also takes her food from her bowl, and eats it a couple feet away. Not sure if it's some kind of instinct or what...   Watching a dog try to 'bury' a toy with a carpet is rather amusing though."
jackrussellterrier,20mzyp,xb4r7x,4,Mon Mar 17 17:27:57 2014 UTC,I think JRT's are somewhat possessive by nature.  Mine also hide toys all over the place.  I will find bones buried in my bed (which is disgusting when I lay down on a wet rawhide).
jackrussellterrier,20mzyp,xcomv01,4,Mon Mar 17 17:39:05 2014 UTC,"Yea she does that as well...she'll take it from her bowl in the kitchen, over to the carpet, spit it out and eat it there."

jackrussellterrier,20mzyp,morganah,2,Mon Mar 17 21:51:47 2014 UTC,My first jack used to get carpet burns on his nose from trying to bury food in the carpet. My current jack doesn't do it at all.
jackrussellterrier,20mzyp,xb4r7x,2,Mon Mar 17 23:02:19 2014 UTC,"Ouch! Fortunately, mine doesn't try that hard. She'll try for a minute or two, get frustrated, and then try to find another spot."
jackrussellterrier,20mzyp,chessyhopee,1 point,Mon Mar 17 23:28:04 2014 UTC,Yes! My JRT takes mouthfuls of food from her bowl then goes to the other side of the room to eat them. Gotta love how strange JRT's can be.
jackrussellterrier,20mzyp,stonecold316,4,Wed Mar 19 16:35:42 2014 UTC,"Mine will hide food if she doesn't like it.  It's kind of cute, like she's too polite to overtly reject it in front of me, so she'll walk off with it in her mouth and bury it somewhere weird (I once found a bunch of off-brand meat sticks buried under my shirts in the closet).  But I've also read somewhere that animals do this if they feel uncomfortable about eating something at that particular time or place.  Changing the dog's feeding time and/or food bowl location could fix the behavior."

jackrussellterrier,20mzyp,DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,1 point,Tue Mar 18 02:23:29 2014 UTC,"My jrt mutt does this all the time. He even buries treats in the backyard and will dig it back up months later and eat it. He remembers exactly where he has buried things and will check up on them periodically. His favorite place inside is behind curtains.   As a puppy he used to spend more time pretending to bury his food (he would make the movements with his nose but he was only nudging air over his bowl) than actually eating it. He doesn't really do that anymore.   Sometimes I will give him a big treat (bully stick) and he won't want it right then so instead he carries it around the house looking for a spot to hide it, but for whatever reason can't decide where, so he just wanders around the house making a little helpless whining noise as he considers spots to leave it.

jackrussellterrier,20bm8d,pixelneer,2,Thu Mar 13 15:33:49 2014 UTC,He normally doesn't and knows better but he was chasing a squirrel in a new environment with his mother ( my wife) and doesn't listen as well when he is with her. If I was there he would have stopped rolled over and laid there till I picked him up.

jackrussellterrier,20b757,tinknal,3,Wed Mar 19 17:44:27 2014 UTC,"Jack Russel's aren't classified pure breeds! They have no breed specifications. They can be mixed, with wire, soft, long or short hair, tall, short, pricked ears, floppy - 'jack russel' is really just any sort of small ratting terrier - Parson Russel are pure breeds, but you'll never find a pure Jack Russel - it's the opposite of what they are mean to be! They are working dogs, true and true, and have never been pinned down with breed requirements. In effect, every Jack Russel is a mixed breed sooner or later!"
jackrussellterrier,20b757,Miss_Musket,2,Mon Mar 24 19:54:10 2014 UTC,"This is pure poppycock.  Jacks have very stringent breed standards, but you cannot determine them from a picture.  If you are talking about AKC standards they are just a fraud for fools.  Real Jack Russels will never be part of the AKC."
jackrussellterrier,20b757,njbh86,1 point,Thu Mar 27 01:17:33 2014 UTC,"I don't know about America, but in Britain Jack's don't have breed standards, and  are considered purely working dogs, not show dogs. Jack owners who use them for working are wholly against giving them a breed standard because they are worried it will effect the natural progressive of breeding to improve the working dog. Mixing the dogs with Lakeland, Borders, any goes, as long as it produces a harder working, healthier dog. The Parson Russel is the one with breed standards.  Jack Russels are just small field terriers breed specifically to go to ground after rats and rabbits, not for showing, not to fit into breed standards. Or, at least in the UK, don't know about America."
jackrussellterrier,209fdi,njrhall,5,Wed Mar 12 20:57:38 2014 UTC,I'll bet he was as happy as a pig in shit. JRTs are never happier than after they've just killed a varmint. Its like they've just discovered their purpose in life.

jackrussellterrier,209fdi,tinknal,1 point,Thu Mar 27 01:20:54 2014 UTC,Did he just kill it without training? Like pure instinct?  I don't think mine would do that straight off. I'd like to see it though!

When it hit the ground, Boaz was already waiting. After a chase, he gave the injured rodent a quick death by breaking its neck with a violent shaking. He did this without much training, only from our encouragement.   After Boaz killed his prey, he ran around the yard for an hour in celebration. He tossed the corpse in the air, and played with it like a gory toy. By the end of the day, he was covered in blood and was panting like crazy. I have never seen a happier dog in my life. Sadly, we had to take the squirrel away from him before he could eat it. Dogs can get parasites and giardia from eating vermin.   We want to train Boaz to be a professional rat hunting dog. This squirrel hunt gave him some valuable experience.   (Squirrels are very common and are considered pests in the Southeast.)"

She looked on and off for several months, and then one day, instantly fell in love with a JRT at first sight. You probably saw her the other day on this subreddit; Fiona.  Seeing the pictures of Sasha and your daughter on the couch and playing in the room reminds of the numerous identical pictures I have with Fiona. She plays at full throttle until she's exhausted, and then hops into my lap or my wife's lap and curls up for sleepy-time snuggles.

With my first JRT I just walked him on a leash around the edge of the property. We lived on a corner lot, in a subdivision. I trained him to stay on the property and corrected him each time he would come onto the road. I think I also used treats with my verbal cues.   After he got the idea there I would use a longer leash and step away from him. Teaching him to listen to my cues without me being so near. You get the idea, eventually I did it without a leash.   The key I think is to teach them that just because you've gotten past the front door doesn't mean it's a free for all and hats the cue to run. I don't let my current JRT out the door ahead of me, or down the stairs, etc. she knows to wait her turn.   Use treats or toys, whichever your dog is most attracted to.   Just a thought, I'm no trainer, but my Pup is a good girl and I can walk her in the front off leash without issue."

They're small, smart, industrious, persistent and athletic.  Also, when they do escape, don't chase them. Every JRT I've ever known LOVED to be chased, it was a type of play to them. We always had success retrieving a footloose Jack by getting their attention (whistling worked for us), then turning our back and walking away. The dogs always came running. This might not work for you, but its worth a try."

jackrussellterrier,204i8k,whr18,1 point,Tue Mar 11 23:33:29 2014 UTC,Ours does the same thing-if he can sneak past the screen door as someone comes in or out he is off. And as some have said chasing him just makes it worse. To complicate things he is deaf and cannot hear us calling and of course cannot hear cars. My wife finally scoped out that if she stood where he could see her that she could make a come hither sign he would come running.

Dink's an incredibly energetic dog when she needs to be as well as being a calm snuggle lap dog.  She's like most other dogs on here, always under foot, but over all a great little dog.  She can hike 14 miles in a day w/o blinking with hardly any need for water which keeps my backpack lighter.  She's the perfect trail dog, always close by, never to wonder far away even if a squirrel is close by.  She can fit the skinniest of trails, crawl under downed trees or hop over whatever is in front of her, but light enough to scoop up if needed.  She lives with 2 cats and we have chickens in the back yard, she only wants to play with all of them.  Her only issue is dog aggression which makes things interesting on trails.   She's the first JRT I've had and the best dog I've ever owned."
