MacroPorn,3e1wjz,nik282000,4,Tue Jul 21 09:14:15 2015 UTC,How did you get this shot?
MacroPorn,3e1wjz,softball753,2,Tue Jul 21 17:38:33 2015 UTC,I used a macro filter lens on a superzoom camera. Macro filters let you focus very close when the lens is zoomed in all the way.
MacroPorn,3e1wjz,softball753,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:40:34 2015 UTC,I was thinking more about how you got the bug to sit still. That's still my biggest issue getting spider shots.
MacroPorn,3e1wjz,softball753,3,Tue Jul 21 22:08:50 2015 UTC,"Keep them cool, it was only about 5-10c that day. Some people like to catch them and throw them in the fridge for a while but I'm not a fan of that.   Try to shoot on cooler days where the bugs aren't in direct sunlight."
MacroPorn,3e1wjz,gepinniw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:21:01 2015 UTC,Ah ok. I'll have to go bug hunting in the colder months then.  What I've been doing is using burst shots and just picking the one or two that lock into a good focus.
MacroPorn,3e1wjz,xsuitup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:36:35 2015 UTC,I'll try to sneek up on them and takes 3 or 4 just to make sure I didn't wiggle the camera or anything. If you are slow enough you can get right up close with the camera for minutes without disturbing most insect.
MacroPorn,3e1wjz,notaneggspert,2,Tue Jul 21 22:43:23 2015 UTC,Great shot. I love these creatures.

MacroPorn,3dsbxh,PedroHin,7,Sat Jul 18 23:59:45 2015 UTC,I can't believe you are looking at that sort of smut.  Shame on you.

MacroPorn,3dsbxh,legion696,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:02:31 2015 UTC,Why is there so little red?
MacroPorn,3dsbxh,Ayevee,2,Sun Jul 19 04:45:35 2015 UTC,It could have been a white balance issue. I'm not sure why.
MacroPorn,3dsbxh,bLaDzErOx,-2,Sun Jul 19 10:12:13 2015 UTC,Because these pixels are projecting in 'white'
MacroPorn,3dsbxh,romulusnr,-2,Sun Jul 19 05:02:05 2015 UTC,"Matte finish. So, not a Retina screen then.   Edit: why???"
MacroPorn,3dsbxh,onepennytoomany,2,Sun Jul 19 13:52:22 2015 UTC,"sadly, no. Just a cheap Asus monitor"
MacroPorn,3dry4o,underthere,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:48:22 2015 UTC,enchantingly horrible. I feel like there is a movie poster and/or gang tattoo in this shot.

MacroPorn,3dqwud,fbauzonx,2,Sat Jul 18 16:22:03 2015 UTC,Nice! You should x-post this to /r/spiders too!
MacroPorn,3dqwud,s18m,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:12:33 2015 UTC,I don't think those are teeth.

MacroPorn,3dpo82,KirbyJW,2,Sat Jul 18 06:08:46 2015 UTC,Were they alive?
MacroPorn,3dpo82,OM3N1R,4,Sat Jul 18 07:00:03 2015 UTC,At one point they were.

MacroPorn,3dn0mf,Gear4th,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:31:13 2015 UTC,"Taken with a Canon EOS Mark II and a Tamron 90mm 1:1 Macro Lens, if anybody is interested."
MacroPorn,3dkkyx,AidoP,7,Fri Jul 17 00:51:25 2015 UTC,"Nice picture :) Interestingly enough, those aren't flowers. They're a part of the moss itself, called sporophytes."
MacroPorn,3dkkyx,doctor_dormouse,3,Fri Jul 17 01:39:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I just started getting into photography these last few days (Although I have always loved macro photography), and this is my first post here. I always thought they were flowers, thanks for that."
MacroPorn,3dhvr4,LordOfTheTorts,3,Thu Jul 16 12:09:20 2015 UTC,Sooo cute!
MacroPorn,3dhvr4,wolfygirl,3,Thu Jul 16 18:39:28 2015 UTC,What a lovely photo of our little amphibian co-inhabitants.   Really great detail.  The turtle's expression of utter disapproval at being manhandled and photographed makes it that much better.  Well done. :)
MacroPorn,3dhvr4,Dammad,2,Thu Jul 16 20:28:06 2015 UTC,"No no no, it was Herman's Hermits.  The Turtles were another band entirely."
MacroPorn,3dhvr4,Kaneshadow,2,Thu Jul 16 21:31:10 2015 UTC,It looks so grumpy!   What is the discolouring on the head from?
MacroPorn,3dhvr4,fuzzybearcow,2,Sun Jul 19 18:19:31 2015 UTC,"If you mean on the ""forehead"", that's just soil. If you mean the lighter color on the back of the head, that's normal for this species. Here's a 5-year-old for comparison, and here their 18-year-old mother."
MacroPorn,3dhvr4,fuzzybearcow,2,Sun Jul 19 18:36:24 2015 UTC,"Ah I guessed soil, but the rest of it was so clean it looked a little out of place.  Thanks for the extra tortoise pics :)"
MacroPorn,3dhkso,FallingFear,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:36:54 2015 UTC,Such a pretty orbweaver. Nice shot of pattern on her abdomen.
MacroPorn,3dhkso,grendel_x86,2,Thu Jul 16 14:53:18 2015 UTC,Thanks! You can check out the small album of shots here.
MacroPorn,3ddspt,Beezer-12,13,Wed Jul 15 14:12:50 2015 UTC,you're a lightning but
MacroPorn,3ddspt,gigarob,3,Wed Jul 15 15:01:03 2015 UTC,Oops. *bug
MacroPorn,3ddspt,gigarob,6,Wed Jul 15 15:08:27 2015 UTC,hee hee
MacroPorn,3ddspt,dataCRABS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:20:30 2015 UTC,Is that the front or the back of the bug because technically it COULD still be a Lightning butt.
MacroPorn,3ddspt,koka558,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:04:42 2015 UTC,"It's the front, BUT of its ""helmet."""
MacroPorn,3ddspt,iagox86,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:15:50 2015 UTC,At least it is next to g. Would have been unforgivable if you had said lightning bus
MacroPorn,3dcuxz,fbauzonx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:25:48 2015 UTC,Insects are so badass looking up close.
MacroPorn,3dcuxz,kenabashi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:58:01 2015 UTC,Bravo for getting so close...love it!
