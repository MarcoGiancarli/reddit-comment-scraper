mindcrackcirclejerk,3cl1q7,gazaroomf,4,Wed Jul 8 19:29:34 2015 UTC,"While it's true that organic milk is clearly the best, and only people like cheaty nebris would choose otherwise. You have to be careful whilst paying money grubbing cashiers with a butt, as they don't not like this form of payment.  I remember one horrific moment in my life, where lord and saviour Etho (RIP in kill) told me to get my snacks. So I ran to the local money grubbing store and payed for my delicious organic milk with my ass. Teh cashier then called his boss, GennyB, and told him that I wasn't paying with emeralds. The next thing I hear is a loud screech and I think ""oh god, not an aureylian video."" The noise becomes too much and I pass out.  A few days later I wake to none other then GennyB himself along side Bdubs. At first they didn't notice I was awake and I over heard their plans to make $2100 and what I heard scarred me for life. So much so that to cure my pain I yell at vechs and btc about their cheating in HUCs comment sections.  When they finally noticed I was awake they made me watch Baj's videos as a way to punish me for paying with my donkey. They said they would never allow me to escape and I would have to watch Baj's videos forever. (Being able to say first on every video and be right isn't worth that.) I had given up hope at this point until one day when lord danky and his m9 pyro came to save me and they succeed.  I was so Euphoric over escaping that I let lord danky spread my ass cheeks wide open and have his way with me.  Lord Danky is love. Lord Danky is life.  Anyway I hope my experience is eye-opening to some of you, and together I hope we can put a stop to GennyB and Bdubs.   Oh, wait we already did because Mindcrack is kill.  And who killed Mindcrack? Oh, right It was GuudeHitlerFist.  Does this mean Guude is a nice guy? You betcha. GuudeHitlerFist is the greatest man I have ever met!

We wanted a group fund so we can go to conventions together. Not all mindcrackers make enough money to be able to afford to go to conventions. Our main goal is to make it possible for the smaller channels in the group to be able to take part in our group activities.  To be able to get a group fund, we needed to be able to negotiate with sponsers as a UNITY, so we can use the pull and power of our bigger channels to cover the smaller ones. That is it. Nothing more, nothing less.  Now we can approach companies and say: Look ,we have 20+ channels and we operate as a group with so and so many views. This way, the smaller guys are always included. If everyone negotiates for themselves, the smaller channels have no chance of getting anything. That is it.  Now you can make up your own mind, what that means for the guys who left. For example in etho's case, it is because zisteau decreed we cannot have two gods."

mindcrackcirclejerk,3c82w7,acwarren492,8,Mon Jul 6 10:12:56 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""VIP is a Mindcracker.""  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a fanboy who studies Mindcrackers, I am telling you, specifically, on reddit, no one calls VIPs Mindcrackers. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""Mindcrack family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Mindcrack, which includes things from ex-members to honourary members to fan server members.  So your reasoning for calling a VIP a Mindcracker is because random people ""call the Youtubers Mindcrackers?"" Let's get Hermitcraft and the Yogscast in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone an Etho or a god? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A VIP is a VIP and a member of the Mindcrack family. But that's not what you said. You said a VIP is a Mindcracker, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of Minecraft Let's Plays Mindcrackers, which means you'd call SkyDoesMinecraft, StampyLongNose, and other Youtubers Mindcrackers, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"
mindcrackcirclejerk,3c82w7,Lost-Chord,7,Mon Jul 6 10:20:42 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know.  That said.  In 7th grade, I took an MS Paint test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any practice or anything. My memes scored higher on it than the normies using it to collect le upethos in my area.  A shitpost test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for shitposting. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of reeeeeeeeeeeeeee for that test.  My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is 4chan memer who contributed significantly to the rise and fall of the pepe market. At the age of 15, I understand collection of rare memes better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent pepe, just allow me to look at the watermarked version for a few seconds. He's no longer particularly successful as a memer, but I've met lots of other memers who aren't as good as me at MS Paint, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at copypastas. I don't have a degree, and other than memes I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of shitposting than any actual professional quote maker, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing OC. For example, I independently created the Navy Seal copypasta before ever accessing the internet, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started sexually identifying as an attack helicopter.  I have independently thought of basically every branch of shitpost I've come across. Every question of DAE which I've seen discussed in /r/circlejerk or /b/ or /r/lewronggeneration or anywhere else, the memes haven't been new to me. Quote-Making has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a meme course just to see how easy it is.  Parody, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike shitposting, there's no aspect of parody which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even the most obscure references.  I'm a good enough OP that I'm creating an AMA and so far everybody who's asked a question has gotten a satisfactory answer. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.  I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm a better memer than you. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my memes, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.  I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Baj at Minecon, I would be against forcing him to stop youtubing. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and getting him to stop eating crisps, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.  I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with BTC's furnace staring whatsoever (short of actually going into the nether to regen health, which is cheating). I don't have any issue with anybody over how red their hair is. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.  I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. GenerikB is a vile, piece of shit munnygrubber, deserving of zero money from children's parent's credit cards, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.  I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've had my memes stolen fighting back or seeking retribution at Karma Court, because the guy acknowledged that I was the content creator after getting his 2100 upvotes. The only time I'll take it to kourt is if 1) the person is a repeat karma whore and 2) the guy is a real pizza. In other words, if the person isn't JamiroFan I don't prosecute. I've therefore never had a reason to take anyone to Karma Court in anything serious, because my ability to take low karma has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off for it. If my link karma isn't negative, I really don't care.  The only exception is if someone is going after my reddit gold. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of downvote-brigading to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a downvote at me and I can get out of it without destroying their reputation, I'd prefer to do that over having them delete their account.  I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but Vetches is 100% Aureylian's bitch. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""switcheroo,"" because that's just not my cup of meme.  That doesn't mean I look for places to downvote people, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).  I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me on 4chan all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit memer community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community and cleaning up all that advice animal bullshit. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time creating new harold memes so that they aren't. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).  And, uh, I'm better than you at moderating circlejerks.  All that, and I think your memes in this thread are totally shitty. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?"

Not just me, not just you - ALL of us. I'm not going to stand for this bullshit - the fact that you will shows how much you care about Mindcrack versus how much you care about sucking Guude's dick.

Hermitcraft built an empire from its lust for gold and territory. BTC shaped a battered furnace into a UHC superpower.  But war never changes.  In the 21st century, war was still waged over the resources that could be acquired. Only this time, the spoils of war were also its weapons: views and subscribers. For these resources, Chad would invade Mindcrack, the Buffalo Wizards would annex Coe, and the B-Team would dissolve into quarreling, bickering nation-states, bent on controlling the last remaining resources on Youtube.  In 2015, the storm of world war had come again. In two brief hours, most of the website was reduced to cinders. And from the ashes of viewer devastation, a new group of content producers would struggle to arise.  A few were able to reach the relative safety of the large underground Mindcrack Discussion subreddit. Your family was part of that group that entered /r/mindcrackcirclejerk.

So Chad + Mcgamer = Guude. Not only does this mean Guude is Chad which proves Chad killed mindcrack, but this also means Guude is Mcgamer, who runs Zeldathon.  Do you know what this means?? GreatScottLP is in zeldathon. Guude runs zeldathon. However, we all know Guude killed Scott, which means zeldathon is kill too.

As someone who is a scientist who studies buffalo, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls Buffalos Yaks. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""yak family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens. So your reasoning for calling a Buffalo a yak is because random people ""call the black ones yaks?"" Let's get cows and moose in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A buffalo is a buffalo and a member of the buffalo family. But that's not what you said. You said a buffalo is a yak, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the buffalo family yaks, which means you'd call cows, moose, and other bovines yaks, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

I have been able to speak to women for the first time because they want to know about my le maymay man, or my latest awkward seal.

mindcrackcirclejerk,37csox,themanoftacos,5,Tue May 26 19:39:26 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: some m8 is not understanding what it constitutes to be a minecracker and therefore theyr mincrack experience is limited to Etho, who they still firmly believe to be the only one true and powerful leader who you need to praise and appreic8, and that you must never watch le bteam, and therefore there dank memes are not dank enough to be danked here and you must cherish this moment because it might mean Etho is not kill if minedrack is kill, but what if mindrack was not realy kill? Did guued kick evryone out just because theire videos are vlog-style commentary that doesn't fit with the aim of the rest of the group and hence he stole efos server and banned him and made a webwork and now you must ask Etho to join hemrticraft, but you must also ask him to be allowed to even talk to guude even thoug guud willyes is rip in pepperooni and therefor Etho is kill? Unless Etho is illmuanti and has three sides, the ebola side, the mindcrackk side, and the hermitcraft side. But then therr was Mindcrack™ and Etho was really kill because you must now pay $2100 to karmafan2100 to be allowed to have your videos posted on the Mindcrack™ subreddit, and because Etho had just given his money to charity to blow up generikb's mansion for $2100 he was out of money and so jamirowhore2000™ did not post his videos anymore to the official™ Mindcrack™ subreddit™, and because ...the hate train be rollin...AGAIN! he didn't get a single view on his videos anymore becayse 100% of his views are from reddit, and so he went bankrupt and must now do videos for hermitcraft™ which was such a slum that even le gernekib who's dressed in friggin rags was too wealthy for and abandoned. So now Etho is no longer part of Mindcrack™ and therefore gouda made a network called Mindcrack™ Network™ and you must ask etho to join the network because it's etho's server after all, but once you get permission by Etho you can pay the Mindcrackers™ another $1337 to be randomly and completely unbiasdly selected from a group of 69 people. You can then be in a video together with the Mindcrackers™ so they can grub even more views and ad money from their stupid PlayMindcrack™ videos that no one actually cares about but watches anyway because there's NEW MINDCRACKER HYPE and then those bitches don't even invite you to the server, because the whitelist is actually controlled by Etho and he is not affiliated woth Mindcrack™ and hence he has all the right to not sign any contracts or let random people on his server. So, now this m8 is asking if content related to these people that were allowed to talk to the Mindcrackers™ by Etho but not actually whitelisted on the server are affiliated with Mindcrack™ and if their content is appropri8 for the Mindcrack™ Subreddit™ or the Mindcrack™ CircleJerk™ Subreddit™ (which is not affiliated or to be confused with the Mindcrack™ Subreddit™ or with the MindcrackDiscussion™ Subreddit™).  The long version, is Minecrack Network the same as Minecrack?"

I can almost see your pathetic overweight frame glowing in the dark, lit by your computer screen which is the only source of light in your room, giggling like a like girl as you once again type your little Banana thread up and fill in the captcha. Or maybe you don’t even fill in the captcha. Maybe you’re such a disgusting NEET that you actually paid for a 4chan pass, so you just choose the picture. Oh, and we all know the picture. The “epic” Banana guy, isn’t it? I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos on the floor, but it’s ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that’s right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she’s probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about a fucking banana. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic Bananafag NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can’t even try to talk with you because all you say is “I REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS PICTURE.” You’ve become a parody of your own self. And that’s all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he’s done a million times now. And that’s all you’ll ever be."

As is, I spend a lot of time creating these thumbnails with cool art style and graphical quality, but there's an easier, more efficient way to do thumbnails that earns me more money, so why not do that?"" (Remember when btc experimented with this... shall we say... awkwardly? LOL thinking about it!) This is totally fine, to me. We always demonize mindcrackers for making economically conscious decisions concerning their videos, when really, most of us would do the same thing. Not to be crude, but for example, Aurey could wear a sweater in every video/vlog she makes, but if she just shows a little cleavage and puts her attractive face in the thumbnail, she'll get more views undoubtedly, so why the hell not?"
