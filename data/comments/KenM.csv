KenM,3e28yr,Anathema_Redditus,36,Tue Jul 21 15:27:53 2015 UTC,Ken M probably just woke up  His troll game wasn't on point yet.  Ya...that's it. Ya...

KenM,3e28yr,-ohioisonfire-,40,Tue Jul 21 19:37:04 2015 UTC,At least this person commenting is trying to help in a positive way.
KenM,3e28yr,JTMTL,9,Tue Jul 21 14:38:53 2015 UTC,as opposed to trying to help in a negative way like the good lord intended

KenM,3e28yr,haylan9,11,Tue Jul 21 16:12:55 2015 UTC,I keep seeing these posts scrolling down from /r/all. What is this sub about?
KenM,3e28yr,AbsoluteContingency,57,Tue Jul 21 16:37:45 2015 UTC,Ken M likes to comment on Yahoo articles with comments that are somehow both clever and stupid at the same time. People don't realize hes joking most of the time and respond angrily and then Ken M usually gives an even better response.
KenM,3e28yr,DaveS1551,20,Tue Jul 21 16:53:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks! What a niche subreddit, jeez. Not that I don't enjoy it, just odd that it's so popular for one guy making comments on another site."

KenM,3e28yr,dbx99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:38 2015 UTC,"To a large extent, yes.  Depends how much you have eaten, how vigorous you are being, how prone you are to throwing up, and if you've had a lot of alcohol.  It would take a lot to make a person cramp so much that it would be dangerous, especially if they aren't swimming far from somewhere safe, like the edge or shallow end of a pool/standing depth in ocean or lake, but vigorous swimming (or any strenuous exercise) after a large meal can result in cramping or at least discomfort. Additionally, if someone vomits easily after eating and/or has consumed a good amount of alcohol, subsequent swimming is more dangerous."

KenM,3dv9ew,Thefriendlypsycho,140,Sun Jul 19 20:26:04 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ, this sort of comment isn't even necessarily a troll, it could easily just be a joke yet still there's someone who becomes infuriated and has to express their intellectual superiority."

KenM,3dv9ew,dustinyo_,184,Mon Jul 20 16:06:09 2015 UTC,Pixar needs to beat Disney to the punch on this one. Nothing would inspire young drones more than a nice family film about the merits of working hard over being a bully.

Somewhere in the UK a whale was found 800 yards from shore (still pretty far, but you can see the beach in the far distance in another pic).  They speculate he beached during high tide, but damn that is still a loooong way for a whale to flop from the beach."

KenM,3ay35x,mage2k,17,Wed Jun 24 16:05:43 2015 UTC,"Section 3. Natural of article  Cetacean stranding:       Whales have beached throughout human history, so many strandings can be attributed to natural and environmental factors, such as rough weather, weakness due to old age or infection, difficulty giving birth,  hunting too close to shore and navigation errors.  In 2004, scientists at the University of Tasmania linked whale strandings and weather, hypothesizing that when cool Antarctic waters rich in squid and fish flow north, whales follow their prey closer towards land.  In some cases predators (such as killer whales) have been known to panic whales, herding them towards the shoreline.   Their echolocation system can have difficulty picking up very gently-sloping coastlines.  This theory accounts for mass beaching hot spots such as Ocean Beach, Tasmania and Geographe Bay, Western Australia where the slope is about half a degree (approximately 8 m (26 ft) deep 1 km (0.62 mi) out to sea). The University of Western Australia Bioacoustics group proposes that repeated reflections between the surface and ocean bottom in gently-sloping shallow water may attenuate sound so much that the echo is inaudible to the whales.  Stirred up sand as well as long-lived microbubbles formed by rain may further exacerbate the effect.

If someone wanted their newspaper delivered, they could write their address on a public tray, it was often titled after the newspaper. They wrote the address underneath, hence, sub-script-ion = underneath-text-ing. The sub from subway comes from the way which is underneath. I just made the first half up but this sentence won't be the last for those which skim quickly. Hence this is where the word sub-woofers comes from.  tl;dr old newspaper subscription services"

Doing their job well should be their duty, not something they do just for extra cash. So I actually kind of agree with Ken-M's trolling here."

KenM,356cc8,ElusiveGod,-1,Fri May 8 15:20:25 2015 UTC,"Eh, the restaurant's income is going to come from customers regardless. I get how the practice of tipping is a bit weird, and I'm generally for higher wages, but it doesn't strike me as disgusting how things are."
KenM,356cc8,CountGrasshopper,8,Fri May 15 06:07:43 2015 UTC,"What if they don't get enough tips? Why not just have the prices be a bit higher and give less tips instead?  That way, they get a livable wage to begin with. I think its like that in some of the states, but I can't remember entirely and I'm too lazy to google it"
KenM,356cc8,Jointmaster420SWAAAG,-1,Thu May 7 18:23:26 2015 UTC,"Because that's not how we do it. Inertia is one hell of a thing. If you started a restaurant like that, telling people not to tip, people wouldn't think about how it evens out, they would just think that your food is overpriced and you're trying to stiff the serving staff, and nobody would eat there."
KenM,356cc8,CountGrasshopper,12,Thu May 7 23:26:50 2015 UTC,"Then make it illegal? I mean, the US is a first-world country, if you have a job I kinda think a livable wage is something you should get."
KenM,356cc8,Jointmaster420SWAAAG,4,Fri May 8 00:10:11 2015 UTC,"You're misunderstanding. If the tips that they make don't equal what they would have made working for minimum wage, then the restaurant/establishment is required to pay them the difference. It's no different than if they were making minimum wage, except that they have the opportunity to earn even more."
KenM,356cc8,fuck_off_ireland,3,Fri May 8 00:45:15 2015 UTC,Right. Now one issue is that that isn't always enforced. I'd be fine with laws that would change that and/or raise the minimum wage in general. Trying to eliminate tipping altogether is silly though.
KenM,356cc8,CountGrasshopper,1 point,Fri May 8 00:52:47 2015 UTC,Except many places don't pay the difference... sure there's an upside for some places but for many (possibly not even most) the employee's aren't making more than minimum wage consistently; and in most places the management isn't compensating for this discrepancy.
KenM,356cc8,ElusiveGod,0,Fri May 8 01:12:11 2015 UTC,Have you been to France? Tipping is mandatory and the service is awful. Tips are an incentive for a waiter/waitress to perform well.
KenM,356cc8,Roboyoyo,2,Fri May 15 06:10:42 2015 UTC,"I have, but that was looooong ago. But... What do you mean ""tipping is mandatory""? Isn't tipping by definition not mandatory? Or do you just mean there's a big stigma against not tipping, as in the US?  Also, that says more about the restaurants you went to than whether tips actually make servers give more of a fuck. I've been to restaurants in countries where tipping is common with shitty servers that didn't care at all, and I've been to restaurants here in Norway with amazing service, even though they don't get tips at all."
KenM,356cc8,Jointmaster420SWAAAG,3,Mon May 18 21:46:42 2015 UTC,"The only thing that irks me about the way the US does it is that restaurant's get around the minimum wage laws by claiming that servers can make the minimum wage in tips, which means they become dependent on tips. If everyone has to pay 15%, just mark up the cost of food 15% and pay your servers minimum wage."
KenM,356cc8,Ramin_HAL9001,3,Mon May 18 22:24:59 2015 UTC,"The only thing that irks me about the way the US does it is that restaurant's get around the minimum wage laws    This isn't true at all. Employers are required to make sure employees make minimum wage. If I work for 8 hours at $2/hr and make $10 in tips, the employer has to pay me the extra $32.   No one who has ever worked for tips is against tipping. It's SO much better for the employee because you are guaranteed minimum wage with the very likely possibility of making much more than that.   Then there's the issue of peak hours. Many restaurants have extra servers come in for ~3hrs a night just to handle the dinner rush. If the US didn't have a tipping culture those servers would almost certainly be making minimum wage ($18/night) instead of upwards of $60/night.   The only people against tipping are customers who think their food would be cheaper if they didn't have to tip. Maybe this is true, but from my travels to non-tipping nations and foreign friends I highly doubt it."
KenM,356cc8,coldfrontin,3,Fri May 8 06:09:44 2015 UTC,"FYI, it has to be over a total pay period, not just one day. At least in GA anyways. Source: former restaurant manager/employee"
KenM,356cc8,Gossmann,2,Fri May 8 16:43:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification.
KenM,356cc8,coldfrontin,1 point,Mon May 11 13:21:30 2015 UTC,"If I work for 8 hours at $2/hr and make $10 in tips, the employer has to pay me the extra $32.   I see, I didn't know that.  OK, so why not just mark up the cost of food 15%, pay the server $8/hr to begin with, and let them keep tips on top of it?"
KenM,356cc8,Ramin_HAL9001,2,Mon May 11 13:30:00 2015 UTC,"That'd be fine, probably. Though, I'm skeptical that people will tip as much if they know servers are making $8/hr and if their food cost is also increased to subsidize the extra $6/hr.  With a dinner rush a server might turn 15 tables in 3 hours. If my assumption is correct, those tables are now tipping ~$1 each (what I tipped in foreign countries). That's $39 at the end of the night those 3 hours. In the current system you'd probably get $3 per table plus your hourly rate, which is totals $51. The dynamics of restaurants are just weird because they revolve around peak hours. I waited tables for 6 years in many different restaurants and only 1 kept every server on for the full shift, which is the only way a server would really benefit from an increase in hourly wages. *Unless you work a double shift, which would be moneyyyyyyyy."
KenM,356cc8,coldfrontin,1 point,Sat May 9 08:20:08 2015 UTC,"If everyone has to pay 15%, just mark up the cost of food 15% and pay your servers minimum wage.   More often than not, that would result in servers getting paid less, especially since a lot of people tip more generously, and this would remove that flexibility."
KenM,356cc8,CountGrasshopper,2,Sat May 9 12:06:47 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, this certainly is not the case in Japan where tipping doesn't happen at all, ever. In the US, if the cost of food simply increased 15% while still allowing tipping, tipping would not be required for the server to make minimum wage, but would still give people the means to express their gratitude towards servers they liked, and allow servers to make more money just the same.  I don't know if this is true, but I have heard a lot of restaurants are doing this in New York now with not much difficulty.  If I recall correctly, the typical server job pays a third of minimum wage, and considering minimum wage isn't enough to live on, server's pay is really ridiculously low, which is why there is so much ill will towards people who don't tip. This is just such a weird situation that is completely contrary common sense."
KenM,356cc8,Ramin_HAL9001,8,Fri May 8 06:18:10 2015 UTC,"What I hate the most is Americans pathetic attitude towards this, it's as if they're literally powerless to do anything.  Tipping isn't really a thing in Europe because bosses here are inherently nicer, it's because workers went out and fought for better conditions."
KenM,356cc8,Cymry_Cymraeg,7,Fri May 8 07:02:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah but in the US there is a huge stigma against workers banding together and fighting for their rights, or unions pretty much. There's sort of this ""well, just work harder"" attitude. A lot of people really go against unions."
KenM,356cc8,Sex-Haver,-8,Thu May 7 22:37:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, boo hoo."
KenM,356cc8,Cymry_Cymraeg,7,Fri May 8 05:04:16 2015 UTC,"Not trying to make a sob story, I'm just trying to explain why America is still on the tip system. It is literally part of our culture that we reject workers banding together for any sort of change."
KenM,356cc8,Sex-Haver,0,Fri May 8 05:14:19 2015 UTC,"It's funny because the Japanese probably don't get paid enough either, they don't have another option but to suck it up though.  (Didn't mean this as an attack to tipping, it's just how things are.)"
KenM,356cc8,Paulo27,2,Fri May 8 05:24:49 2015 UTC,"This is true, but I'm also willing to bet that  Japanese restaurant wages are more in line with their standard of living (ie minimum wage, or whatever system they use).  Compare that to the U.S., where the vast majority of servers have an hourly wage of $2.13/hour, give or take, which is less than a third of the federal minimum of $7.25, which itself is quite literally barely enough to get by on in the current U.S. economy. Tips can make up anywhere from 80-95% of most server's hourly income, if they're lucky enough to have generous patrons.  TL;DR: yeah, the restaurants in the U.S. Are pretty fucked up."
KenM,356cc8,elwunderwalrus,1 point,Thu May 7 19:59:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, I could work a full shift and make less than I currently do at my job in an hour, and that requires no degree."
KenM,356cc8,joyhammerpants,1 point,Thu May 7 21:20:41 2015 UTC,"To make decent money really depends on what kind of restaurant you're serving at, and what your schedule is like.   If you're working at an evening restaurant that does fine dining and you get stuck with a morning-afternoon shift, good luck making money, but if you get an evening shift, you could easily make $20+ an hour, especially at a place with large checks, although your shift is likely to be quite short, and you'll be worn out, especially if you're in a restaurant that has its servers run its own food.  $20+ an hour does sound pretty nice, but even if you've got a short shift, you'll be busting your ass for most (or all) of that shift.  I personally worked in a restaurant as my first job, and stayed there almost 3 years. It was definitely gratifying having money in your pocket, but it almost never felt worth it at the end of the night."
KenM,356cc8,elwunderwalrus,1 point,Thu May 7 22:34:16 2015 UTC,"The only restaurant experience I have is working in fast food years ago, I certainly was expected to work harder then, than at my job I make $20 an hour for."
KenM,356cc8,joyhammerpants,1 point,Fri May 8 09:00:26 2015 UTC,"I almost (heavy emphasis on that) would've rather worked hourly in a fast food place, or somewhere like chipotle or panera (the ""nicer"" fast food places), even if it meant less cash per hour.  They're two different atmospheres, but at the same time, they do have quite a few parallels as far as rude customers, stingy customers, shitty management, etc. Neither fast-food workers or sit-down restaurant servers are treated very well though, so it likely would've been less money for slightly less work overall."
KenM,356cc8,elwunderwalrus,1 point,Mon May 11 01:36:50 2015 UTC,"In Japan they get paid at least minimum wage (unlike the US) because it's illegal to pay less than minimum wage for any job. Since tipping absolutely unacceptable (they will actually chase you out of the restaurant trying to return your change if you pay more than the bill), full-time servers need more than minimum wage or they wouldn't work at any restaurant that didn't pay them enough because it wouldn't be enough to survive. Most part-time servers are fine with minimum wage."
KenM,356cc8,Ramin_HAL9001,21,Mon May 11 12:26:31 2015 UTC,And he isn't wrong.
KenM,356cc8,Paulo27,13,Mon May 11 14:20:10 2015 UTC,"Like, why can't waiters get a wage like any other job?"
KenM,356cc8,G3Kappa,-8,Fri May 8 06:06:09 2015 UTC,Because if they paid staff enough to actually live on they'd have to raise prices in the menu and wouldn't be able to say how reasonable their prices are.

KenM,34f4yb,JeamBim,15,Tue May 19 03:43:59 2015 UTC,I am so happy with these Ken M posts
KenM,34bi5x,cloud-is-good,114,Wed Apr 29 20:49:04 2015 UTC,"Wow, each successive Ken M comment was better and better with an incredible payoff"
KenM,34bi5x,Shasan23,110,Thu Apr 30 02:05:20 2015 UTC,It takes genius to feign stupidity at this level.
KenM,34bi5x,Fartoholic,74,Thu Apr 30 04:22:37 2015 UTC,We should study the future to prevent mistakes from happening in the past.
KenM,34bi5x,flashbunnny,31,Thu Apr 30 01:42:30 2015 UTC,"The problem is that we can only use inner space to see the future, so we can only change the present. We need to invent a way to reach in-between space, so we can change the past in the future."
KenM,34bi5x,TheOctagon24,43,Thu Apr 30 02:19:52 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, that last line is fucking hilarious."

KenM,34bi5x,JazzFan418,11,Thu Apr 30 06:54:25 2015 UTC,"""If we don't study the mistakes of the future we're doomed to repeat them for the first time"" that's fucking deep"

KenM,34bi5x,supremecrafters,5,Thu Apr 30 07:32:17 2015 UTC,"if observing outer space gives us a view of the past, observing inner space would surely give us a glimpse into the future.   Woah. That's deep, man. Looking inwards to find flaws with ourselves can let us see how they would hurt us in the future--allowing ourselves to correct them in order to continually better ourselves.  I know Ken M. pretends to be an idiot, but that actually sounded very smart and philosophical. At least, it did, until he mentioned NASA making a telescope for that."
KenM,34bi5x,AirStryke,3,Wed May 13 17:28:06 2015 UTC,"""By looking at the world around us we can see the past, but only by looking within ourselves can we see the future.""  That sounds like something a philosopher would say."

KenM,34bi5x,Cryzgnik,-3,Fri May 15 14:47:20 2015 UTC,"a second ago   I always hate seeing that. I have this delusion that people who post screencaps here discovered a hilarious Ken M post to share, but alas, it's just trolls jerkin the circ."
KenM,34bi5x,Magikarpeles,17,Thu Apr 30 07:20:52 2015 UTC,it's just trolls jerkin the circ.   What does that even mean in this context? KenM is allowed to screencap his own comments
KenM,34bi5x,shadowbannedlol,-7,Thu Apr 30 07:32:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like the likelihood that this is actually Ken M capping and posting his own work, and not some impostor, is pretty much nil."

KenM,34a616,The_Crass-Beagle_Act,15,Thu Apr 30 02:01:51 2015 UTC,Yahoo! has some of the meanest comments on the web. Everyone just seems so radical all the time. And not in a good way.

NOTICE: I tried submitting one of KenM's new photos from Facebook, and it hasn't shown up at all on the subreddit. I know for sure I posted it here, but I can't see it.

He first appeared in the 1992 Game Boy title Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins as the main antagonist and final boss. Originally portrayed as an exaggerated version of Mario, his name is a combination of Mario's name and the Japanese word warui (悪い), meaning ""bad"". Wario was first designed by Hiroji Kiyotake, and is voiced by Charles Martinet, who also voices many other characters in the series.

It only feels like there is no gravity, since it's an equal pull in opposing directions. Also, as shown by Black holes, gravity can affect the photons and waves that create the light as we know it. So the ""lens""  is really light being pulled slightly, but not a physical thing."
