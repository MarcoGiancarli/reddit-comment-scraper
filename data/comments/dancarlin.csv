Which the Blueprints for Armageddon series spawned from.   Maybe this is the Alexander one he's wanted to do."

dancarlin,3d8ds4,shadowmask,3,Wed Jul 15 00:43:53 2015 UTC,This was one of my favorites and I think his first multi part series. Just gave it another listen yesterday. The battle of Canae description is a standout in the entire HH podcast imo. Enjoy!

dancarlin,3d31q5,colevatican,2,Mon Jul 13 16:34:13 2015 UTC,I think China could fill an episode or five. Then again a HH version of the 30 year war would also be awesome.

I'm from the south and so I always hear a completely different take on it as opposed to what actually happened. It would be nice to hear a rational, non biased, factual point of view. And it's the only war the country has ever had amongst itself, which I think is pretty important, especially considering the way things are going now."

dancarlin,3bzwoy,seekingsoul,28,Fri Jul 3 14:40:35 2015 UTC,"I love seeing Dan Carlin getting some mainstream love like this. Can you imagine if we got a Netflix series in the same vein of Cosmos, but hosted by Carlin? Holy shit, that would be amazing."
dancarlin,3bzwoy,borkborkbork99,19,Fri Jul 3 19:32:18 2015 UTC,Dan has said on a number of occasions that he has been approached for such projects but rejects them. The argument was that he was against compromise and deadlines that would be required; thus affecting overall quality.   I am personally satisfied with a podcast with the current quality.
dancarlin,3bzwoy,WissNX01,5,Sat Jul 4 00:11:13 2015 UTC,"I totally understand that, and I respect it. It doesn't take a genius to listen to any of his HH podcasts and comprehend the amazing amount of researching and studying that Dan undertakes with each episode. However, I think Dan could potentially entertain the idea of allowing a team to mine his existing HH podcasts and develop shows based on those. Something like the great documentary style of Ken Burns."
dancarlin,3bzwoy,borkborkbork99,2,Sat Jul 4 02:39:49 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have to host them. All he needs is images to go with his podcast, like this one. I know I will watch them if they were on Netflix.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mwT6tPHulY"

Since Sam started pimping HH on his blog and podcast I always thought they'd have an awesome but civil debate, and that's exactly what happened."
dancarlin,3bzwoy,turbozed,2,Fri Jul 3 17:13:59 2015 UTC,I desperately want Dan to start making documentaries in the vein of HH.  But still the same wide format. Love it.  I remember seeing someone's video where they had animated themselves over Dans voice. It was sweet

dancarlin,3bqree,The_Shaug,2,Wed Jul 1 12:08:16 2015 UTC,"I actually love Pocket Cast, it's the closest I got to what I wanted. However they only have the most recent episodes, and the only way I can find to import podcasts requires OPML format? How do I listen to the mp3's I have bought from Dan Carlin's site?"
dancarlin,3bqree,bakanek0,3,Wed Jul 1 12:18:17 2015 UTC,"http://www.shiftyjelly.com/support/pocketcasts#115  You can manually add mp3 files to a folder location on your Android device & they will show up in your Pocket Casts page as a blank folder icon for ""Custom Episodes"". They don't auto delete like subscribed podcasts do but you get the suspend/resume feature & it tracks played/unplayed as well.  Hope this helps."
dancarlin,3bqree,The_Shaug,0,Wed Jul 1 16:50:06 2015 UTC,Android is compatible with Windows. This method is a bit lack luster but copying and pasting mp3 files into Windows Media than sinking it to Android Play Music. It takes a bit more work to organize but not to much of a hassle to place files.
dancarlin,3bqree,Fap-0-matic,2,Wed Jul 1 12:26:31 2015 UTC,"Just download the mp3s to your Android phone and use any number of file browsers like es browser to move the downloaded mp3s to the pocket cast downloaded folder.   Alternatively, Google play music will find the mp3s right in your download folder and play them from there just fine."

dancarlin,3aoium,Flip3k,6,Mon Jun 22 05:20:52 2015 UTC,"Common sense comes out about once a month, HH used to come out once every three months, lately it's been closer to 4 or 5 months."
dancarlin,3aoium,john_andrew_smith101,5,Mon Jun 22 06:19:22 2015 UTC,"I usually figure a new Common Sense every 2 weeks (give or take). I would expect Hardcore Histories to start running ever 3 months again, as I'm pretty sure that he's going to be spending the next few installments speaking on topics that are further removed from the present and not as heavy to sift through as Blueprint was. I think that the WWI show (which I thought was absolutely brilliant and I wouldn't change a thing) took a lot out of him and he'll be tackling smaller one-off episodes for the next several iterations. I hope."
dancarlin,3aoium,afistfulofDEAN,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:26:50 2015 UTC,Honestly I wouldn't mind if he exclusively did series.  It's gotten to the point where his one part episodes just doesn't have enough content for me.  I feel he doesn't go as into depth with those than I prefer.
dancarlin,3aoium,derp_08,3,Tue Jun 23 23:49:13 2015 UTC,"Common sense is a current events show, so he only needs two or three weeks of news articles and every episode is roughly an hour long.  Hardcore History however have been mostly series that when put together are 20 or so hours long, which he uses 60+ sources for.  There is an insane amount of work that goes into both programs but HH requires days of research for every hour of the show.  On top of that I'm sure there are multiple takes, lots of writing, planning and weeks of editing before he puts out a finished product and that makes him, in my opinion, the best history Podcaster out there. And during all of that he needs to multitask and push out a common sense episode at the same time. Dan is incredibly hard working and dedicated to his craft, and it shows in his work.  But typically you'll get 4-6 common sense episodes for every HH episode. Also if you haven't listened I highly recommend Wrath of the Kahns, Deth Throes of the Republic, Punic Nightmares, and Prophets of Doom."

dancarlin,3amts6,LanceBosh,18,Sun Jun 21 19:44:25 2015 UTC,How exactly would it help him be faster?
dancarlin,3amts6,pdcjonas,8,Sun Jun 21 20:02:15 2015 UTC,"Patreon gets 5% of all payments, plus more for paypal and credit card payments.  He gets all the money on his current method, except his costs for running the payment system and credit card fees.  What's wrong with the way he's doing it now that would make that 5% revenue loss worthwhile?"
dancarlin,3amts6,elmonoenano,4,Sun Jun 21 20:15:57 2015 UTC,"Also, I'm pretty sure he knows about Patreon. He's talked a lot about exploring different avenues for funding. But his listenership is large enough at this point that he's probably okay without losing the 5% or whatever for commission."
dancarlin,3amts6,thetonyhightower,3,Sun Jun 21 22:20:43 2015 UTC,"It might be a nice way for him to make more money, but I don't want rushed HH. I'd prefer quality over quantity. I don't see how Patreon would speed him up."
dancarlin,3amts6,rj20876,7,Sun Jun 21 21:06:51 2015 UTC,Why do you think getting him on patreon would make him put out shows faster?
dancarlin,3amts6,dmanww,2,Sun Jun 21 20:53:28 2015 UTC,"To me the benefit would be allowing people to truly pay ""a buck a show"". I personally don't want him rushing anything."
dancarlin,3amts6,ajoberstar,2,Sun Jun 21 20:16:35 2015 UTC,"The only way I could think it would get out more HH is if he split up the time and did smaller HH.  But after learning about his processes a bit and how he records, it sounds like his mind/style doesn't work that way.  So even though I'd rather have smaller and more HH episodes, I just don't think it will happen."
dancarlin,3amts6,fpssledge,3,Mon Jun 22 09:44:57 2015 UTC,Not a bad premise. But the only way HH is gonna get done faster is if he abandons his massive audio book style podcast and goes back to the early days of doing short ones.
dancarlin,3amts6,dbick,8,Sun Jun 21 20:04:56 2015 UTC,Which would be a tragedy.
dancarlin,3amts6,shadowmask,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:06:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'd want shows more frequently. The current wait time gives me a chance to listen to an episode a few times to make sure I've understood every point correctly.   He also mentioned on The Wolf Den that he'd rather give us not enough content than too much, so people aren't overwhelmed by more content than they could ever consume, which I definitely agree with having been turned off of some shows for that very reason."
