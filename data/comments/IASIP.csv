IASIP,3e1fb6,theastcoasthero,6,Tue Jul 21 05:34:19 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of episodic comedies, but Sunny, to me, is the one comedic show that I insist people watch from beginning to end, in order. It's by far my favorite comedy and the way the characters evolve through the course of the show is hilarious, ridiculous, and wonderfully deluded; seeing that process is one of the highlights of the show to me. I know it seems like a lot but the episodes are only 20 minutes, so it's about the same time commitment of 4 seasons of your typical drama.   But if you're gung-ho on skipping some episodes I'd say you have to watch all of 1-5. 6-7 I think are the weakest of the show, but 8-10 pick things back up really well. Overall though I love all of the seasons."
IASIP,3e1fb6,dillardPA,2,Tue Jul 21 06:24:33 2015 UTC,"Calling 7 a weak season of the show, what a Jabroni. Did you just forget the gloriousness that was Fat Mac?"

IASIP,3e1fb6,NewMerril,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:37:34 2015 UTC,"I agree, the show is really kickass so far! The reason I am wondering if I can watch them out of order is that there are like 10 seasons and I dont know if I can commit to that time investment to watch all of them"
IASIP,3e1fb6,NewMerril,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:41:20 2015 UTC,"You can totally skip ahead if you want, and most jokes you'll get, it's just that for the full experience you would need to watch them all."
IASIP,3e1fb6,Whitefeather16,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:43:48 2015 UTC,I watched random episodes here and there when I first started watching it but I switch gears and watched it from the beginning and its a lot better because you get those jokes and stuff you might no understand if you watch ranom episodes.

IASIP,3dyeau,Madux37,16,Mon Jul 20 16:13:28 2015 UTC,"Something I've noticed from re-watching the series about Mac being gay - the things that happen to him at the beginning of the series in regard to sex might be responsible (being with Carmen, especially) for the awakening of his sexuality - I actually think we watch as Mac silently realizes and denies to himself that he's into dudes."
IASIP,3dyeau,BakedBadz,11,Mon Jul 20 17:39:40 2015 UTC,I think you're right. His religious extremism seems to increase parallel to an increase in the gay stuff too.

Then Season 10 came along and every other episode there was an obvious joke. I'd rather they kept being subtle or came out with it, now they're just killing the gag."
IASIP,3dyeau,heyyoowhatsupbitches,11,Mon Jul 20 16:54:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I liked the more subtle attempts to kiss Dennis through the years.  The trash men episode and the Flowers for Charlie episode both had one.  Plus they had the project badass stuff earlier.  Very subtle."

Charlie was added later and though not their fist choice, he has a indespensible value now, as he does the things nobody else can, or will do. The wild card if you will. Dee and Frank are the alternating outer layer, though Frank has bonded quicker and has demonstrated more value with his brains, brawn, insanity and cash. Frank seems to have taken Dees spot just with his relationship to Charlie and his cash. Dee is the outer layer and the butt of their jokes. The useless chick, who is a focal point for abuse, but also a needed element to keep the ball rolling. I feel like i could develop this more and i am not at all high.

IASIP,3dt6qg,robbedstark,6,Sun Jul 19 16:59:35 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely say Mac or Charlie are the two front runners. They seem to be more easily manipulated by Frank or Dennis and at times they even go as far as trying to do the right thing... or at least what they think is the right thing. As opposed to Frank, Dennis, and Dee who always act for selfish reasons.  I look at Charlie's obsession with the Waitress. In his warped mind he's protecting her and actually makes her life better... and he actually kinda does. Yes, he stalks her and that obviously isn't good. But his motivation for doing so is due to his warped view on life and limited mental capacity.  Same with Mac and his religion. He tries to instill his warped view of Christianity on everyday life because he feels that's what's best for the people around him.  They both obviously have warped and morally corrupted views on life, but they seem to be like the less ""evil"" or detached of the group by far. Unless we count Dee in season 1 before she got really, really selfish. Season 1 Dee is easily the most selfless of anyone in the Gang."

IASIP,3dt6qg,heyyoowhatsupbitches,2,Mon Jul 20 00:26:53 2015 UTC,Well I think the idea was that Charlie would get to go the beach house party too and would also become friends with the flyers/radio guys.

People don't like change. Mac even comments at the beginning that he doesn't want to listen to the story.  The Gang Broke Dee is the next episode that is similar in terms of focusing on one particular character. However the rest of the gang has a lot of involvement throughout and the payoff at the end is worth sitting through what is essentially a documentary about a bird.   Charlie Work, Dennis Reynolds: An Erotic Life, and How Mac Got Fat are worth mentioning as they focus mainly on their respective characters - but all these episodes have the paradigm in spades. Frank's Brother is the only episode in the entire series to deviate from the paradigm, and we all know what happens when the paradigm is off.   I think the criticism the episode receives is warranted. Maybe the episode is a little out of place. Frank's history hadn't been established yet and perhaps they packed too much into one episode.

IASIP,3ds6tm,grytpype,2,Sun Jul 19 13:35:38 2015 UTC,Season 10 was my favorite.
IASIP,3ds6tm,5_times84,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:45:32 2015 UTC,Everyone is entitled to an opinion but imo Season 10 is significantly worse than the others. They changed the focus from 'a show about crazy bar owners with some small running jokes' to 'a show focusing on the once small running jokes and happen to have a bar.'  Went way overboard with Dennis and Mac
IASIP,3ds6tm,johnycake,2,Sun Jul 19 20:38:42 2015 UTC,"This is a perfect description. A lot of the small jokes felt forced, like the goblin-ghouls, the where do I put my feet, the Mac-gay stuff, and a lot of other small things. In the past it all felt naturally.  Although Charlie Work was an absolute instant classic."

IASIP,3dnb45,guinfred,47,Sat Jul 18 02:35:36 2015 UTC,They actually DID get nominated... for Outstanding Stunt Coordination for a Comedy Series or a Variety Program.  Their stunt coordinator has been nominated for the last three years but never won.  All that great acting and writing gets nothing but the Emmys sure do love them some stunt work.  I'm just going to assume its for when Dee broke the bar stool and fell down.

IASIP,3dnb45,ledbetterus,66,Sat Jul 18 17:10:58 2015 UTC,"I posted this in another Emmy related thread but it always feels good to say.  Screw the academy.  Awards are stupid.  It's all completely subjective.  It's a dick sucking popularity contest.  In the immortal words of Eddie Vedder after winning a Grammy, ""I don't know what this means, I don't think it means anything.""  I know Sunny is awesome.  You all know it's awesome.  That's good enough for me.  If everyone else doesn't know Sunny is awesome well then they're sorely missing out on what is probably the best comedy ever made, or at least top 3 with Seinfeld and Curb.  EDIT:  In the documentary Pearl Jam 20 the band talks a little about the Grammy's and how little they care.  Jeff Ament says something like ""this is art man, I don't need an award, its art"".  Also Stone Gossard finds his Grammy in the basement covered in dust and cobwebs, saying something like ""you can tell how much we cared about the Grammys"".  EDIT2:  If you have any doubts to the Sunny/Pearl Jam connection then here's a little known fact for you:  Rob was in Pearl Jam."

Consider how many people watch the major broadcast TV shows like The Big Bang Theory, compared to how many people watch Sunny (or The League, Archer, Workaholics etc) on smaller, subscription based cable channels.   If anything, the awards would be worse, because at least the Academy acknowledges the Cable dramas, even they wouldn't get a look in if they were publicly nominated. As you said, it'd be NCIS and CSI winning the awards for best drama.  And then all the technical (and I mean even down to best director) would have virtually no votes, because the general public doesn't care for or understand anything about them."

IASIP,3ddgbp,Ketamine_,-1,Wed Jul 15 18:48:48 2015 UTC,"Yes and no, they were of mayan decent but there were other groups that absorbed mayan land and xulture and what not. It's like saying there is no Trojans after the fall of Troy but unless everyone was killed yhere will be and always be people of Trojan decent plus people outside the city identify as Trojan and even outside of Troys territory."
IASIP,3ddgbp,DrunkPython,9,Wed Jul 15 19:49:43 2015 UTC,"No. The Classical Mayan period ending in 900 AD was, to start off with, not the end of an empire as there was never a 'Mayan Empire'. Like the Aztecs, people did have a collective ethnic identity to some degree, as Maya, but politically they were organized in city-states, not overarching nations. Sometimes those city states would be confederated, some times multiple cities may be dominated by one ruler, but the Mayan civilization was not like Rome, completely dominated by one capital, one ruler. Upon that the Classical Mayan collapse was not a singular date with a single end, but a process that lasted hundreds of years.  Second, the Post-classical period ending with the Spanish Invasion, was defined by the Maya people, still very much Maya, migrating around the Yucatan, primarily following sources of water. Eventually, they founded the city of Mayapan, and others along the coast, as society redeveloped. Eventually, Mayapan was abandoned about two hundred years later.  The Maya were still very much around, very much still Maya when the Spanish arrived on the Yucatan."
IASIP,3ddgbp,BasqueInGlory,8,Thu Jul 16 00:02:27 2015 UTC,"There's still Mayans around even to this day, though, further south in Guatemala and Honduras, so the Spanish did have contact with the Mayan people.

My dad's side of the family is of sephartic jewish descent (fled to mexico during the Spanish inquisition) and my mom's side is a mix of Spanish, Roma(Gypsies/Gitanos) and Indigenous Mexican.  Hispanic , or latino isnt a race, its an ethnicity. It is like in the biology you have Kingdom, Genus, Species etc.   It goes Latino/Hispanic first, then Nationality (country of origin) then race (black, white, mixed etc).   That is why in demographic questions they ask you what your race is (white, black, indigenous w/e) and then if you are hispanic/latino as a separate question.  You can be black and hispanic. White and hispanic. Indigenous and hispanic, or mestizo/any combination.  For example, Carribean Latinos like Cubans, Dominicans, sometimes Puerto Ricans can be a mix of black/afro/ spanish/ indigenous.

My grandmother on my fathers side spoke Nahuatl as a first langue and spoke broken Spanish.  Mexico is more diverse than people think.

I remember when I watched the series sequentially and got to that episode and I was just like ""holy shit, these guys are doing crack!"" And every episode after that was like a whole new show. It was like I had been watching a normal run-of-the-mill sitcom and then the seedy underbelly was revealed.

They only wanted stuff they could produce outside of their work with Sunny.   At this point, after ten years they have their writing process so streamlined that you'd have to be a writer/creator duo of a super popular premium cable drama to have your script produced.  I understand that's not necessarily what you're going for here, but nonetheless I doubt they'll ever see it.   But good luck, and keep practicing writing.

[Scene opens with a shot of Frank on stage warming up a crowd of men before Dennis’ next appearance; Mac and Dennis are off stage behind a curtain discussing their individual agendas…]  Frank …Are you constantly striking out with the broads you’re trying to bang?  Do chicks look at you like you’re a low-life piece of shit?  Well get ready for Dennis Reynolds to change your life.  Just take it from me, Dr. Mantis Tobbogan.  Before I started the D.E.N.N.I.S. system I was just like you – I shared a futon with a guy and had to pay for all my sex.  But now, I’m swimming in free poon and it’s all because of Dennis Reynolds…  Dennis That’s right, Frank, rile them up nice and good.  Make them putty in my hands.    Mac Wow, man, you’re really drawing a crowd out there.  Dennis Damn straight I am, Mac, because I have a trustworthy face that says, “listen to everything I say, and give me your money”.  Every one of those guys out there is a potential goldmine just waiting for me to sell them the dream.  Mac Every one of those guys out there is a potential threat to your safety, Dennis.  Luckily you have me here to assess the situation and separate the fans from the stalkers.  I brought my Ocular Pat-Down Glasses and I’m ready to bash face at the first sign of danger.  Dennis Oh yeah, thanks Mac.  I feel real safe.    Mac Dennis, as your head of security I can’t have you undermining my expertise like that.  You hired me to identify potential threats and then bash their faces in.  I can’t be effective if you don’t trust me to do my job.    Dennis I didn’t hire you at all.  You glommed on to my success, like always, and proclaimed yourself my bodyguard.  I won’t trust you to do your job because I never would have given you that job in a million years.    Mac That’s just because you’ve never seen me play my A-game.  Paddy’s was too small-time to waste my best bouncing moves.  Now that I’m utilizing my skills to protect a bonafide celebrity, you’ll see exactly how much value I can demonstrate.  Dennis What did you just say?  Mac I said you’ll see how much value I bring to the system once I demonstrate my physical engagement skills on some psycho stalker [karate moves].  Dennis See this is what I was worried about, Mac; that you’d ruin this whole thing with your many delusions.  You can’t D.E.N.N.I.S. me so don’t even try.  Why don’t you just go back to the bar?  I’m sure Charlie and Dee need your help way more than I do.  Mac You need me whether you like it or not, buddy.  Celebrities are always dependent on their bodyguards to protect them from the crazies.  What would you do without me if some obsessed psycho accosted you at a show?  Waitress [Approaches from off-screen behind Mac and steps in between him and Dennis]  Hi Dennis.  Dennis Um, hi?  What the hell are you doing here?  Waitress Well I saw your infomercial the other night, and I know it’s been a long time since we’ve seen each other.  I’ve been trying to keep my distance for a while now, hoping that you’d come around to your senses.  But then I realized that I can’t be afraid of my feelings.  We should just embrace fate and open ourselves up to lo…  Dennis Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.  Are you trying to Inspire Hope right now?  GODDAMNIT why is everyone trying to use my system against me?!  AGH!  Face it, Waitress, there’s no hope for you and me.  We will never be together, so let’s just skip to the next step and Separate Entirely.  Mac Haha, how could you think you’d wind up with Dennis?  He’s so far out of your league, and he doesn’t even know your name!  Waitress Jesus Christ, I have a name for shit's sake.  It’s…  Frank Hey, what’s The Waitress doing here?  Mac She’s trying to D.E.N.N.I.S. Dennis but it’s not working.  Dennis Pot calling kettle, Mac.    The Waitress UGH!  Screw you assholes. [exits screen]  Frank  Alright, Dennis, you’re up.  You ready to rock worlds tonight?  Dennis UGH, Frank, you know, I was ready to kill it but now Mac and the Waitress have me all pissed off.

You have a stressful job, but you need to be high-energy out there so take a little gumski and go do your thing.  [whips out bag of cocaine]  Mac You think that’s a good idea, Frank?  Frank This is standard stuff, Mac.  All the big players fuel their career with energy drugs.  Billy Mays, the Sham-NOW! guy, they all get their power through the powder.  Dennis Alright, well, if Billy Mays does it then I guess it’s OK for Dennis Reynolds. [takes a gummy] HOT DAMN, FRANK!  Yes!  Alright, let’s get it going now.  I am ready to rock!  Woo!  Frank [does bump] Alright, now get out there and knock ‘em dead.  [Dennis exits the screen onto the stage to a roar of applause]  Mac You think I can get a little bump too, Frank?  Frank Aren’t you on duty?  Mac, we can’t have our Head of Security all yakked up while he’s on the job.  That’s just unprofessional.  Now, which way did the waitress go?  I’ve got my wad of hundreds and I’m ready to plow.

IASIP,3da30s,HomEntertAnment,78,Wed Jul 15 04:01:21 2015 UTC,"I thought it was pretty good. If I can give some constructive criticism, there are WAY too many references in that opening scene. It's not very good writing if there's so many callbacks instantly, it's lazy. Overall, I think it's a very good idea for an episode though."
IASIP,3da30s,bigdawg83,27,Tue Jul 14 20:45:15 2015 UTC,I definitely heard that in my head with their voices haha.
IASIP,3da30s,Brother_Summer,12,Wed Jul 15 03:37:53 2015 UTC,"Their call backs are more subtle, and this reads like fans doing their greatest hits at a party.  No offense op, it shows some talent, but i would approach it from letting the dialogue breath a bit to tell a new story. I like the idea of everybody trying to Dennis Dennis, but it seems like we already know that punch line. I would focus more on the dark side of PUA's and Dennis' psychotic personality.  Maybe write in a few guys who take it too far, and get arrested  and try to blame Dennis. then do a separate story with maybe Dee and Charlie, as they are less likely to be involved in said scheme. Just my two cents. Thanks for sharing!"
IASIP,3da30s,KyrieEleison_88,5,Wed Jul 15 00:40:36 2015 UTC,"I like the idea in General. They've tried to monetize everything else they've done. Why not The D.E.N.N.I.S. system  Thoughts;  Do you have a cold open? Every episode starts with a cold open, before opening credits. Could even be the infomercial itself, the gang watching it?  A lot of the jokes are just re-treading. Which they definitely do, but its a lot of just call backs. I imagine theres going to be a bit of that in this episode naturally since you're revisiting the DENNIS system.  - The ""ocular pat down glasses"" feels forced. If anything he would just have them on. and Dennis would give him shit. -Same with the ""Wad of hundreds..."" Same line verbatim."

[Scene opens with Charlie and Dee inside the bar, chatting while cleaning up before opening…]  Dee This is it, Charlie.  We’re finally in charge of the bar.  It’s time for us to show those bastards that the janitor and the waitress can run this place better than they ever could.  You ready to kick some ass tonight?  Charlie I don’t know, Dee, I’m a little worried here.  How can just the two of us run all of Paddy’s?  I mean I know I have my role down, and that you can do your bad jokes thing.  But who’s going to protect us from potential threats tonight with Mac not here?  Who else but Dennis can regale the bar with tales of his sexual triumphs?  What are we going to do without Frank’s money?  Dee That’s exactly my point.  Mac assaulting random customers and Dennis’ extremely graphic reenactments do not help the bar’s popularity.    Charlie What about Frank’s money?  Dee Well you have me there, Charlie.  Frank’s money has been the oil greasing our gears for years now.  But I’m thinking that with Dennis and Mac no longer around to screw up business, we’ll make more money at the bar, thus we won’t need Frank’s funding anymore.  Charlie Oh, that’s smart thinking, Dee!  OK, so what’s the plan?    Dee Well, I was watching Dennis’ dumb infomercial last night and it got me thinking; what if we tweak his system to fit what we need to do here at Paddy’s, you know?  We’ll cut out all the creepy stalker stuff and make it apply to the bar?  Charlie Hm, not sure I’m following, Dee.  How are we going to have sex with the bar?  Dee We don’t have sex with the bar, Charlie.  The system isn’t about having sex now.  It’s about becoming a successful business and shoving our success in Dennis’ smug face.    Charlie All right I’m with you there; I’ll just follow your lead.  So what’s step one?  Whose pipes should I clog with hair?  Dee Step one is not clogging any pipes with hair.  OK, Charlie?  Step two is we need to start demonstrating some value to our customers.    Charlie Right.  Right.  The customers.  Like, these guys? [points to a trio of degenerate regulars]  Dee Um, yeah, I guess we can start with these guys.  I mean, it’s a bit tricky since these guys are all gross pieces of shit and the best value we provide to them is that we just let ‘em serve themselves and rarely check whether they pay for it or not.  Charlie Yeah I guess it’s hard to demonstrate your value to people who don’t have any value, huh?  Well that’s fine.    Dee Yeah we’ll just continue neglecting these alcoholic bums… I mean “nurturing dependence” with these swell folks here…   Charlie ...and then when new customers come in who have never been here before, we won’t just automatically treat them like worthless garbage?  Dee You’re catching on fast, Charlie.  I’m proud of you, bud.

I actually thought it was one of the funnier ideas I had, to have them talking shit about their regulars while said patrons just sat there right in front of them, staring silently back at C&D.    Plus they had that moment in the Reynolds vs Reynolds trial episode where the regular says thanks as he's walking out of the bar and they all respond back with the type of confusion you'd expect from people who have totally forgotten that they're running a bar/business.  So for me it didn't feel too out of place but I can see how it's almost like breaking the fourth wall-esq."
IASIP,3da30s,Keegsta,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:49:44 2015 UTC,"It's definitely funny, just a bit off-character for them. I actually thought about that exact moment in that trial episode while reading that part of your scene, but that's kind of what I'm saying. The only time(s) they acknowledge customers is extremely brief, yet the build up to that sells it, especially in the trial. They get so deep into their ridiculousness that someone else being involved is almost like a twist in the episode haha. As long as the patrons don't have any dialogue though (like you have it), it works. Keep writing, man."

IASIP,3dc1re,fateislosthope,2,Wed Jul 15 02:34:31 2015 UTC,Local guys and members of Deer Prom comedy (sketch group i guess) got a deal with Comedy central for a web series to see if there is interest in launching more material. They are pretty funny and have a couple other videos. I have seen the smaller guy do standup at Helium which led me to check out their other hearing implant parody video. Was cool to see them finally get some attention and it lines right up with IASIP type comedy.   Man hears for the first time parody

I hate to call the best comedy on TV a jumping off point, and I know they pride themselves on not caring what the industry thinks, but they are getting older and probably want some respect or at least a chance at new things.

IASIP,3cwxct,that_one_guy16,4,Sun Jul 12 05:51:15 2015 UTC,"I've read that parents and such can dull the edge on sociopaths and make them more ... social for lack of a better word. I think Charlies mom did an OK job raising him. Maybe Overbearing and crazy, but she seems to have shown a lot of love to him.  I think Dennis displays a lot of signs of true Narcissism, meaning he projects his personality constantly, but doesn't really have a personality of his own. His god hole. His vanity and Peter Pan like complexes. Also his obsessions with adoration through sex and the Dennis system.  Frank and Dennis' mom seems to only have imparted survival skills haha"
IASIP,3cwxct,LastRedShoulder,9,Sun Jul 12 03:19:43 2015 UTC,"Charlie shows a lot of empathy throughout the show, even demonstrating some compassion for the rats he kills (""Sometimes, I wonder if we are really better than them, ya' know, like are our lives really worth more?""  ""They definitely are""  says Dennis) Then again, when pursuing the waitress, he shows that he's capable of being completely ruthless and horribly manipulative.  I believe this romantic psychosis stems from PTSD, most likely caused by abuse from his Uncle Jack.  His frame of reference for what is normal or acceptable is laughably skewed, his life is a tragic shambles. Severe alcohol and glue abuse have also clearly contributed to his degenerating mental state.  His mother, though loving, offers little in the way of a support system.  Though he shows, uh, a distressing number of warning signs for serial killing, I think you're right that Charlie just isn't capable of that.  He has feelings, warped though they may be. I think Dennis may be a serial killer already though.  I'm not 100% convinced that that isn't where the show is heading.  His parents are just horrible to him, he shows little regard for his sister when she almost dies repeatedly and he keeps ""fetish shit"" in a secret compartment in the back of his hummer.  Then there was all that talk about 'the implications' and I don't know man."
IASIP,3cwxct,East_Threadly,3,Sun Jul 12 04:06:52 2015 UTC,I think he'll ending up killing one or all of them. Or himself. I don't think it will be a happy ending. But that's ok - it's just a show :D haha

Maybe they are both nuts haha"
IASIP,3cwxct,LastRedShoulder,2,Sun Jul 12 21:32:26 2015 UTC,"That's true but so far, we've only seen Dennis making horrible & frightening threats than actually carrying them out.  Charlie on the other hand, despite like what you said - having more empathy - can unexpectedly in a swift of a moment viciously hurt someone as he did in the Christmas special, which is arguably the most graphic scene throughout the whole show :)"
IASIP,3cwxct,East_Threadly,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:11:03 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, Charlie has demonstrated dangerous psychotic breaks. However, these are related to specific traumas and instances, whereas Dennis has a generally psychopathic outlook all the time. While I think Charlie is capable of hurting people, he is not fully cognizant of his actions. In the instance where he used the rich girl, he had no real sense of the reality of the situation.  Nothing Charlie has ever done has demonstrated a healthy understanding of relationships. When Dennis hurts women though, he knows exactly what he's doing.  He has never shown an ounce of remorse for anything and is typically absorbed only in himself and his fixation on, and delusions of, control.  Dennis may not have had an explosively violent break like Charlie, but I think he's demonstrating a more dangerous condition."

IASIP,3co6qx,tkfour20,18,Thu Jul 9 19:06:02 2015 UTC,"Directions  First, spray a saute pan very liberally with Pam or similar cooking spray.    Over medium heat, place 2 slices of cheese in the pan, followed by a buttered slice of white bread (buttered side should be facing UP).    Heat for 2 minutes or a bit longer, being careful not to burn the cheese (this may take a little experimenting depending on how hot the pan is). Next, drizzle or squirt Hershey's chocolate sauce on top of that BEFORE placing another slice of white bread also buttered on one side (again, buttered side facing up) on top.    Let the sandwich cook for another minute. The cheese will be brown, but before the cheese burns, flip the whole mess over so that the buttered bread that you just placed on top will brown nicely and make the bread crispy (just like when you make a grilled cheese sandwich).    The final step occurs after you take this concoction off the heat and flip it onto your plate (cheese side down); immediately smear the top with a thin layer of creamy peanut butter while the sandwich is still hot.    Note: The peanut butter does NOT get grilled. Think of it as a condiment that goes on last, after the cooking is done. Serve immediately."

That said, if you're not sure about the time commitment and want to watch an episode before you spend a bunch of time watching a show you're not sure you're going to like, watch ""Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare"" to get a good feel for what the series is generally like.

But I think it is more aimed at Big Bang Theory and 4 camera sitcoms in general. Think about how bright and loud the set of big bang theory is. Bright lights, and they all wear brightly colored super hero tee's. The laugh track (bell ringing) is ridiculously over the top- the ""crowd"" almost suffocates of laughter from the simplest opening joke. Penny and leonard (I hate that I know their names) have a couple will they/won't they moments as far as I know. Raj is the Indian (non-white) friend.  Scrubs is actually fairly dimly lit in comparison to 4 camera sitcoms (There is even a Scrubs episode making fun of 4 camera sitcoms, and it is noticeably brighter). This, combined with no laugh track and not a lot of background noise gives it a more intimate feel. There is a good amount of sadness/drama/introspection that is simply not in BB theory and others.  Big Bang Theory, 2 and a half men, etc are all trash yet are constantly being nominated for and receiving awards.  Source: huge Scrubs fan and hater of Big Bang theory and most laughtracked sitcoms. So take my opinion as biased if you must."

IASIP,3cmu0e,johnycake,20,Thu Jul 9 21:57:33 2015 UTC,"In terms of lifestyle, probably Dee. She doesn't live in a rat-infested shithole, she's not a closeted gay gym rat, and she's not a rapist/serial killer. She's just a sad spinster bartender.  In terms of mental health, though...I have to say Charlie. It's like the therapist said, he's well-adjusted considering his non-traditional lifestyle. He has his share of issues, but he at least has a creative outlet with his fucked up spider-hole songs, and he seems to be okay with himself. Meanwhile, Dennis is out there probably raping (and possibly killing?) people, Mac is so repressed that he has severe anger issues, Dee is depressed and obsessed with her stupid characters, and Frank is just...beyond help."
IASIP,3cmu0e,elizabro,7,Thu Jul 9 06:41:12 2015 UTC,Frank is just...beyond help.   I don't know why I laughed so hard at that..
IASIP,3cmu0e,SchrodingersMatt,2,Thu Jul 9 17:54:29 2015 UTC,Charlie is the most normal when it comes to mental health? You mean the obsessed stalker who bit/pummeled a mall Santa?
IASIP,3cmu0e,TheSaltbird,2,Sun Jul 12 02:37:42 2015 UTC,"He seems to have calmed down a bit lately, while some of the others have gotten crazier.

IASIP,3cmu0e,elizabro,8,Sun Jul 12 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"So, it's immediately clear that it's a contest between Dee and Mac... and Mac barely ever hatches a scheme, so I feel like he's a little more 'normal' than Dee, who's like an ineffectual Frank."

Except he's prone to flying off the handle like a fucking madman (Christmas episode).   Frank has no conscience and is happy about it, Dennis is a psychopath (but gives a good impression), and Mac is an angry, self-delusional, repressed homosexual."

IASIP,3cmu0e,MayoIsNot_a_Beverage,3,Thu Jul 9 17:14:14 2015 UTC,"Dee, in the sense that she has a conscious, and can recognize that what the others are doing is wrong. Her ""flaw"", is that she's very competitive, in the sense that she wants to try to beat others at their own game. The real problem, for her, is that she's grown up around bad influences....so, ""their own game"" is terrible.   With that being being said, none of them are normal on this show."
IASIP,3cmu0e,Shamwow22,3,Thu Jul 9 18:27:29 2015 UTC,"It's not Charlie for sure. I'd argue most of his idiocy is a veil, as seen in Charlie Work. Illiterate, maybe, (it's hinted a little that's faked) but he's definitely street smart and normal people don't stalk a waitress and ruin their life.  Mac's just repressed, dumb and naïve, making him easily manipulated."

IASIP,3cf5u0,MrVonJoni,23,Wed Jul 8 04:05:50 2015 UTC,"This dialogue here is one of my favorite scenes from the entire series:  Therapist: I'll start by commending you guys for taking the initiative to help Frank.  Dennis: Ah, we're caring people. That's our nature.  Therapist: Um, what's Frank struggling with the most right now?  Dee: Ooh, uh, he is trying to bang our aunt.  Dennis: That's the big one.  Therapist: These things deal more with drug and alcohol abuse.  Dennis: Drugs and alcohol are rolled into what we're talking about here with the aunt thing.  Therapist: So he does have a drinking problem?  Charlie: Oh, big time, big time. But if I'm being honest, my problem's less with the fact that he's drinking and more that he's doing it without me. And then I start thinking, ""What's wrong with me? Am I not fun to drink with?""  Dennis: Oh, no, don't do that to yourself. No, you're plenty of fun to drink with, trust me, Charlie. You get really, really drunk, and then you get reckless, and it's a lot of fun.  Dee: So how do we go about doing this? Do we ambush him, and then just sort of, like, berate him into becoming the guy we want to be around?  Therapist: No, no, no, you certainly don't berate him. He needs to know you're coming from a place of love and concern.  Dennis: Too soft. I think we should come at him with an iron fist and crush him into submission.  Charlie: Right, right. And you know what? If we're taking that approach, you might want to be armed at this intervention.  Therpist: Why would I need to be armed?  Charlie: Well, Frank's usually carrying, like, a little gun around with him and he doesn't really hesitate to use it.  Dennis: And you know what? Have the gun out and ready to rock.  Charlie: Yeah, in fact, we'll all have guns.  Dee: It's just safer.  Charlie: You know what? If we maybe ambush Frank with a net or some kind of, like, rope device, the gun will maybe drop out of his waist belt.  Dee: You want to bring him in in a net? That could get awkward. Just bring the guns.  Dennis: Bring a gun.  Charlie: I don't want to get shot, so just bring a gun, will you? Bring a gun.  Therapist: You know I do offer group therapy.  Dennis: What are you doing?  Dee: What is this? What is this you're doing?  Therapist: With all due respect, you're talking about bringing guns to an intervention, and you're drinking wine out of a soda can.  Dennis: Oh, you put wine in the soda can?  Dee: You didn't know, did you?  Charlie: That's good. You stole Frank's idea. It's a good idea. I mean, the guy's got great ideas.  Dee: He's a smart man. That's not what we're here about.  Charlie: But I do feel like she just tried an intervention on us.  Dennis: Did you intervene on us? Is that what that was? You know what I'm feeling? I'm feeling like you've lost control of the room here and really, we're the ones that are running things now.  Dee: I've lost my trust in you. I feel like we can do this on our own.  Dennis: I think we can do the intervention on our own without her.  Charlie: You guys think?  Dee: Why not?  Charlie: All right. Might as well give it a shot.  Dennis: Let's just do that.  Dee: Thanks for your help.  Charlie: You did your best. No hard feelings. I'm going to grab some of this literature, too.  Dennis: She didn't do that great of a job. Sorry.  Charlie: No, but don't beat her while she's down, man."

IASIP,3cicoh,jeswork,9,Wed Jul 8 10:59:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with that. It happens to pretty much any show that's on for a long time. Best example other than IASIP is Family Guy and how Stewie went from vaguely, possibly gay to full-blown gay over the years."

But I think there's a reason for the sudden literal take on it too. Not that this show is at the zenith of political correctness or anything, but it's just a lot harder to use homosexuality as a joke in 2015 than it was in 2005. It's more of an inevitability than a joke at this point, but then again, the inevitability in and of itself can still be funny to watch."

I think the show might end with Dennis killing them all, or maybe killing Mac.  The problem here is that Mac and Dennis would need enormous amounts of Therpay to come to the point that thinking being sexual together is allowed, or OK, let along marriage.  Mac hates himself, hates gays, and loves the big man upstairs, and that ain't changing.  Dennis is so full of rage he would probably stab Mac if he tried anything, though I do think he gets off on knowing Mac is attracted to him.

IASIP,3ce4qa,Iambertalovejoy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:16:52 2015 UTC,"The point is that the characters are aware that what they are saying is not ""PC"", and are trying to backpedal. One thing that makes Always Sunny great is that each character has his/her own phobias and twisted views, but they are also constantly trying to keep up with trends, including social ones, like the trend of being overly politically correct. Trying to reconcile the two creates a lot of friction and a lot of comedy.

The right amount is great, but people (including myself sometimes) decide it's not kicking in/this shit is weak/it must be bunk and take more too soon and then you're regretting it for the next 8 hours or so.

IASIP,3c8ugu,DickieIam,18,Mon Jul 6 01:52:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know but I think Uncle Jack used to diddle him and Charlie called him the Nightman and since he used to live with them and pay Charlie's mom the rent, she would be the toll troll because Jack pays her to live there and subsequently diddle Charlie (whether she knew he was doing this or not, I do not know)."

IASIP,3c8ugu,manabanana21,3,Mon Jul 6 21:07:19 2015 UTC,"I thought his mom would be the troll, too.  In ""Charlie Got Molested,"" we get a brief view into Ms. Kelly's behavior that the series hasn't touched on sense. When Dennis and Dee go to tell her about Charlie getting molested, she has a moment where she seems to snap, and talks to herself and says something like, ""Now's not the time to have an episode...be strong for your gingerbread man..."" Dennis and Dee are a little freaked out, ask if she's okay, and she acts like she doesn't know what they're talking about.  Basically, his mom seems to be a borderline personality case, and would have bouts of anger and probably abuse and neglect.   It's also possible she is just as stupid and naive as she seems and thought of Uncle Jack as paying rent to live in Charlie's room and was honestly oblivious to what was happening.   However, in the play, Dennis/Dayman calls the troll ""Antono"" right before he shoots him. So I'm really not sure who the troll is supposed to be. Might be a character from Charlie's past we haven't and may never meet or learn about."

FX said ""ok, well, show's done then.""   So Rob and Glen called DeVito.

I wouldn't say he has BPD, as the hallmark of it would be someone who's always looking to pit others against each other true repeated lying and scheming (he's done that once when he made the guys join a cult to paint the house) , getting attention through feeble suicide attempts etc etc. I could go on but it's not quite so interesting.   He does indeed display narcissistic traits when he repeatedly declares himself the golden God and a legend, associating himself with the cool kids of his school when in fact all he ever did was to hang with dirtgrub and Mac. He probably also has an antisocial PD - as he displays a total lack of regard for the law. He doesn't register words like no, don't, or stop. It just doesn't work on him. This having to be right business might stem from this PD, where he thinks he's definitely and irrevocably the best and brightest person in Philly and just can't handle it when he's proven not to be.   As with other personality disorders, I'm pretty sure you can make a case for every single one when discussing the gang.

IASIP,3c4lrh,deejaysea,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:31:05 2015 UTC,It's gotten significantly better over the seasons. season 3 onwards it's gold.
IASIP,3c4lrh,Just_Floatin_on_bye,-3,Fri Jul 17 06:55:24 2015 UTC,Seinfeld is like the cleanest series I've ever seen. It's like a kids show. why do people compare this to IASIP?
IASIP,3c4lrh,stunts002,15,Sat Jul 4 18:58:20 2015 UTC,because it's a show about 4 completely self-centered friends who repeatedly do terrible things to the people who come into their lives
IASIP,3c4lrh,mekka-lekka-hi,11,Sat Jul 4 19:02:38 2015 UTC,and they basically never feel bad about it. George's fiancee dies and he's happy because he doesnt have to marry her anymore.
IASIP,3c4lrh,mistersavedthread,10,Sun Jul 5 04:27:20 2015 UTC,The thing you have to remember with Seinfeld is that when it came out there was nothing like it.  Every subsequent sitcom was based on Seinfelds model and at the time it dealt with adult situations and observational humor that was actually pretty taboo at the time. It seems tame now but it was groundbreaking at the time

IASIP,3btsig,SkyUraeus,7,Thu Jul 2 18:49:55 2015 UTC,The scene in the sensory deprivation tank with British Accent Dennis that makes him go down on him god self should announce all this demonstrably.  It's why the sex tape was alluded to previously

A lot of people also might not be aware, but plenty of professors in law school (especially after 1L), will often say they don't care about proper citations--they just want to know the basics to be able to find the material.

IASIP,3b9ts9,katzke,10,Sat Jun 27 04:03:47 2015 UTC,This would just take way too long. You'd need someone who has a ton of knowledge of criminal law (or the patience to search through what amounts to an encyclopedia to 'diagnose' each crime) along with the time to watch 10 seasons of a show.

This isn't even counting what might be considered the civil wrong of battery ('YOU'RE GONNA DIE TONIGHT, BITCH', and iirc, he slashes her tires?).

You used those airline miles to buy 400 steaks. Knowing this delivery company delivered a variety of animal products, your plan was to contaminate the steaks by rubbing live chicken feathers on them. Then you were going to repackage the steaks. At that point, you were going to return the steaks for actual cash, taking advantage of a loophole in the current airline mile system. Correct?"

IASIP,3ayuz1,bbb19,30,Wed Jun 24 18:30:08 2015 UTC,I disagree. I think the characters became caricatures of themselves in the same way.  Seinfeld also gets more and more over the top as the seasons progress.
IASIP,3ayuz1,TaylorWolf,27,Wed Jun 24 20:21:24 2015 UTC,But at least IASIP exists in a sort of bizzaro world where many of the people they interact with are also kind of fucked up.

IASIP,3ayuz1,rmc1317,10,Wed Jun 24 21:59:59 2015 UTC,"My favorite episodes are the ones where the gang is pitted against normal people, like the Lawyer, Fatty Magoo, etc. The gang spends so much time in their own fucked up little world that their depravity is ultra magnified when they're among comparatively normal people."
IASIP,3ayuz1,Calikola,9,Thu Jun 25 13:49:58 2015 UTC,"But I like how they still manage to bring the worst out in everyone. The lawyer arguably has become a worse person for having been with them. He screws them over whenever he can. Even if they deserve it, I imagine that isn't the correct thing for a lawyer to do.   When they're at the high school reunion, they turn a bunch of successful, well-rounded adults back into children. I mean they give them atomic wedgies in the bathroom.   I don't think I need to bring up Cricket."
IASIP,3ayuz1,KidCasey,10,Thu Jun 25 15:21:23 2015 UTC,"That's part of what makes IASIP great, is that most of the people outside of the gang that they interact with are also fucked up and have no redeeming qualities as well.  Cricket, Gale the Snale, the Waitress, the McPoyles, the Ponderosa's etc.  None of them are good people."
IASIP,3ayuz1,HeyZuesHChrist,12,Thu Jun 25 13:41:48 2015 UTC,"I just love how some of those people have been dragged under/influenced by their experiences with the Gang, like Cricket, the Waitress and Maureen Ponderosa. Cricket was a respectable priest, the Waitress was just a regular lady, who was maintaining her sobriety, and Maureen Ponderosa was just an unemployed timid lady who loves crafts. Cricket is now a street rat, the Waitress is a hot mess who has banged Frank, and Maureen Ponderosa is trying to become a cat."
IASIP,3ayuz1,Calikola,5,Thu Jun 25 13:52:22 2015 UTC,"And that's also what I love about the show.  If there is any crack in your veneer you should stay away from the gang.  They will drag you down with them.  Any sign of weekness will be exploited by them.  I think the gang was responsible for all of those people diving into their own depravity, but I also think they were simply people who had issues and simply needed somebody to nudge them slightly in the right direction in order to take that dive.  The gang doesn't nudge you, they push you off the cliff."
IASIP,3ayuz1,HeyZuesHChrist,3,Thu Jun 25 14:02:07 2015 UTC,"That's exactly it. The people I mentioned above had weaknesses that could be exploited and the Gang just fed into it. For comparison, look at the Lawyer or Fatty Magoo. They have their lives together. The Lawyer was getting divorced from his wife and the Gang tried to mine that for their own gain. He didn't have the same weaknesses as Cricket or the Waitress, and has been able to successfully repel them.   Dee and Dennis tried to use Fatty Magoo's successful business so they could advance in the fashion industry. They both tried to play on the fact that Fatty Magoo, well, used to be fat, and exploit those those possible insecurities. Turns out Ingrid had moved past what happened in high school and didn't fall for it."

They are a group of shitty people who are difficult to watch at first, but power through 5 or 6 episodes and you'll suddenly start to love them for some inexplicable reason."

IASIP,3ayuz1,TacosAreAwesome,3,Wed Jun 24 17:32:15 2015 UTC,"That's sort of how I have always described it to people! As a huge Seinfeld fan, it's easy to see the comparison. A group of people who inside are pretty damn shitty and ruin shit for everyone around them, while not giving a god damn fuck who they fuck over.   It's like Seinfeld on meth."
IASIP,3ayuz1,smackfairy,3,Thu Jun 25 01:27:07 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of surface level comparisons too. Both shows have a home base: Jerry's apartment and Paddy's  Both shows have returning side characters: Crazy Joe, The Maniac  Both shows have three dudes and a useless chick  Both shows have a deranged friend: Kramer, Charlie"
IASIP,3ayuz1,KidCasey,254,Thu Jun 25 15:29:45 2015 UTC,Sunny is a lot like Seinfeld in a lot of ways but far less relatable.
IASIP,3ayuz1,TheSharkAndMrFritz,235,Wed Jun 24 17:21:05 2015 UTC,I agree. Seinfeld was more about societal misunderstandings of relatively normal people. IASIP seems more about absurdly selfish people when they come in to conflict with society.
IASIP,3ayuz1,theaceplaya,39,Wed Jun 24 17:45:38 2015 UTC,"Seinfeld stole bread from an elderly woman and shouted ""shut up you old bag"" as he took it and ran. He then went to jail for that and countless other crimes.  I think the laugh track and '90s clothes fool people into thinking it's tamer than it is."
IASIP,3ayuz1,Svviftie,21,Wed Jun 24 21:18:55 2015 UTC,"True, but he didn't do something like that every week. He and the others went to jail on an obscure law and on the testimony of people who have misunderstood situations over the years. Babu Bhatt being deported? Misunderstanding, the mailman (likely Newman) is the one to blame. Soup Nazi going out of business? Maybe don't be SO harsh on paying customers. The puffy shirt? Learn to speak up, lady. The Doorman? He was intentionally confrontational for no good reason.  A big part of the finale was that you could make any person look like a dick if you delve far enough into the minutia of their everyday life and go through the trouble of rounding up every person who has ever been mad at them.  But I do agree with you somewhat. Seinfeld and his friends are in no shape or form spotless human beings."
IASIP,3ayuz1,theaceplaya,5,Wed Jun 24 22:02:29 2015 UTC,My thing with Seinfeld that always made me think they were bad people is the miniscule reasons they would use for breaking up with people. Especially Jerry. That seems like a very Dennis thing to do in my opinion.
IASIP,3ayuz1,KidCasey,3,Thu Jun 25 15:31:58 2015 UTC,She eats her peas one at a time!
IASIP,3ayuz1,Kancer86,62,Thu Jun 25 16:06:37 2015 UTC,Uhm. You might want to reexamine your understanding of the Seinfeld characters. George and Elaine especially.
IASIP,3ayuz1,icallshenannigans,104,Wed Jun 24 18:26:45 2015 UTC,"Well, in comparison to The Gang, they're pretty normal. George and Elaine became more and more neurotic and self-centered, respectively, over time. The Gang started out as assholes from day 1 and have just gotten even more outlandish and specific in their quirks over time."
IASIP,3ayuz1,theaceplaya,25,Wed Jun 24 18:48:14 2015 UTC,"gotten even more outlandish and specific in their quirks over time.   Flanderization. It's extremely obvious with this most recent season. They just went completely overboard. I'm not talking down on this past season, because I thought it was hilarious, but it was such a huuuuuge leap with the gang and their quirks."
IASIP,3ayuz1,zxain,67,Wed Jun 24 19:45:52 2015 UTC,"I Disagree. Everybody calls all character development Fladerization these days. The gang has been nuts since day one. Mac was dating the Tranny in season one, Charlie faked cancer, Gun Fever was season one. Hell, Dennis fakes a relationship with a woman's dead grandfather to bang her. They have all lost some control, but the idea that they weren't always on this path just isn't so."
IASIP,3ayuz1,Lampmonster1,16,Wed Jun 24 20:13:27 2015 UTC,"I never said that they weren't on that path already. What I'm saying is that it has become completely ridiculous this last season. Look at Dennis and the Family Feud episode, or the episode about the star ratings. We've always known Dennis has been super neurotic and basically psychopathic, but it has always been subtle or low-key, not him having a melt down on live TV or yelling at random people in a restaurant.   Same for Mac. It's always been hinted that he's gay, but this last season pretty much threw it in your face.   I'm not saying that there's no character development. It's obvious there has been since the start of the show. What I'm saying is that they blew all those traits up to where now they're the main focus of the character. And it happen quickly and to a very large degree. Not like the previous seasons where the characters would slowly develop and change.  Once again, I'm not bashing the latest season. I fucking love it."
IASIP,3ayuz1,zxain,8,Wed Jun 24 20:59:45 2015 UTC,The way I see Dennis' shift is that as he gets older and becomes more out of touch he's becoming less successful with women and getting increasingly frustrated and self conscious.
IASIP,3ayuz1,rutefoot,8,Wed Jun 24 22:15:21 2015 UTC,"Also you can't downplay the fact that the entire Gang has been drinking heavily since they were what, fourteen, thirteen?  I mean, I drank in high school quite a bit, and continue now in college. I have seen no major side effects other than binging fast food on Saturday nights.  But these people are in their thirties and store booze in cleaning containers. That kind of constant, non-stop drinking has to weigh heavily on the brains of people who are largely unstable to begin with.   Also, they all at some point abuse inhalants. Dennis and Dee are crack addicts. Mac would just stab insulin in his thigh whenever after he got fat.   They are already sketchy upstairs, but the cesspool of drugs they pump into themselves definitely adds to their mental state in latter seasons if you ask me."
IASIP,3ayuz1,KidCasey,23,Thu Jun 25 15:38:36 2015 UTC,"But it's not any one aspect of the characters taking over, they're just getting more extreme in a logical way. Mac is losing his battle with his self image, Dennis is losing everything that supported his absurd ego, Charlie is probably literally retarded at this point from huffing chemicals. They're all alcoholics, and always have been, and that's taking a toll. Dee, well fuck Dee, that bitch. I just don't see it as a lessening of the characters, and that's what Fladers implies."
IASIP,3ayuz1,Lampmonster1,8,Wed Jun 24 22:14:40 2015 UTC,"I'd say it didn't happen as fast as you're saying. You can see everyone in the gang get more and more fucked in the head as each season goes on, with each one just being a little bit worse than the last. The only thing is we're now at season 10 so it's been adding up to awhile to make the shitstorm that is the gang now"
IASIP,3ayuz1,rmc1317,5,Wed Jun 24 22:04:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah but season 10 seems to have jumped ahead about 1-2 seasons, it caught me off guard the first few episodes."
IASIP,3ayuz1,MagicSkySon,5,Thu Jun 25 05:37:41 2015 UTC,"Season 10 wasn't too surprising if you ask me, considering season 9 ends with the gang lighting Mac and Dennis' apartment on fire and boarding the door up so all the people inside couldn't leave"
IASIP,3ayuz1,rmc1317,2,Thu Jun 25 06:18:20 2015 UTC,"That's one of my favorite parts of the show. Watching it all the way through it is logical that they are at the point they are now.  I watched some season ten with my buddy who doesn't watch it regularly and he was like, ""What the fuck happened?"" I had to explain to him some episodes in between for their current state to make sense."
IASIP,3ayuz1,KidCasey,2,Thu Jun 25 15:40:30 2015 UTC,"Yup. Continuing on Seinfeld as an example, Jerry was always very clean and a bit of neat freak. There were episodes and some relationships of his where it was a highlight, but it didn't become his defining characteristic, to where that ALL he was."
IASIP,3ayuz1,theaceplaya,2,Wed Jun 24 22:08:27 2015 UTC,"I think now that the show is coming to its end they're just like ""fuck it let's get crazy now"""
IASIP,3ayuz1,book-reading-hippie,7,Wed Jun 24 22:27:14 2015 UTC,"Everybody calls all character development Fladerization these days   I respectfully disagree. There are very clear lines between character development and flanderization. Anybody mistaking them does not understand the concepts. Cricket is the only character on the show to have true development, and I think it's safe to say that Dennis was heavily flanderized this past season.  Case in point:   Cricket started off as an innocent priest, but after frequently facing conflict--always involving the gang--has to deal with the consequences of not overcoming the conflict without the gangs help (which always results in him getting screwed over). Eventually, he becomes as deranged as the gang, if not worse. Pretty clear development going on.  Dennis started off as an egotistical, and neurotic young man, occaisionally demonstrating some psychotic behaviour. By the tenth season, he's completely irrational, demonstrating psychotic behaviour every chance he gets. This development was not from facing conflict, but rather because Dennis is his funniest when he's acting all crazy. Personally, I think this is very clearly flanderization, although I'm interested to hear your opinion on the matter."
IASIP,3ayuz1,UncleBenjen,12,Wed Jun 24 22:05:11 2015 UTC,"I think it is not, because it's exactly what you would expect to happen to a narcissistic asshole who has surrounded himself with like minded idiots and is losing the characteristics that supported his ego. He believed this image of himself because he was good looking and young and able to manipulate people. That's all slipping away and he's been steadily losing his grip because of that. I have binged the entire series over the past week or two and you can watch it, step by step. It's the same with all of them frankly."
IASIP,3ayuz1,Lampmonster1,7,Wed Jun 24 22:12:02 2015 UTC,"That's a good point... a certain ""natural progression"" if you will.  I still wouldn't call it good character progession, but I see how it's not really flanderization, at least not to any extreme.  Thanks for sharing."
IASIP,3ayuz1,UncleBenjen,5,Wed Jun 24 22:37:48 2015 UTC,"Always glad to discuss Sunny. I'm not claiming great lit level character development mind you. After all, it's a comedy."
IASIP,3ayuz1,Lampmonster1,2,Wed Jun 24 22:40:19 2015 UTC,"The difference between character development and Flanderization is change. Edit: I thought about it for a bit longer and realized Flanderization can be a form of character development. They are technically changing as people, even if only to become caricatures of themselves. It is shallow character development, but development none the less.  As someone below said, character development is Cricket. Flanderization is taking a small aspect of the character (Charlie's financials and intelligence becoming him being a mild autist, Frank's midlife crisis turning him into a crazy drug addled old man, Dennis's womanizing turning into sociopathy, Mac's insecurity becoming more pronounced and becoming repressed homosexuality, and Dee's need for validation going from a quirk to dominating her life) and just slowly turning the dial from 1 to 11 over the course of a show's run. That's Always Sunny, and it's not a bad thing, it's fine, it's a natural and easy way to keep the show fresh after a decade. People expect escalation and familiarity, Flanderization is perfect for that.  Also it's good to know 'Flanderization' is a thing, it's something I've noticed about many shows and never knew had a term until now."
IASIP,3ayuz1,evangelism2,5,Wed Jun 24 23:12:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's an accurate definition of Flanderization. It's not just turning it up, it's making it all the character is. Flanders went from a normal guy who was religious to a religious nut and nothing else. That has not happened with Sunny. They are still the characters they were, they're just losing their shit."
IASIP,3ayuz1,Lampmonster1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:16:43 2015 UTC,The act of taking a single (often minor) action or trait of a character within a work and exaggerating it more and more over time until it completely consumes the character. ...the trait/action becomes completely outlandish and it becomes their defining characteristic.   How is that not the things I mentioned above?
IASIP,3ayuz1,evangelism2,2,Wed Jun 24 23:26:34 2015 UTC,"Because it has not consumed any of the characters. That was my point. Dennis is still a poon hound, still a control freak, still argues and plays games with the crew in addition to his crippling narcissism. Charlie is still in love with the waitress, still a drug addict, still loves music and ghouls. None of them has been cheapened, they've just gotten worse."

IASIP,3ayuz1,caustictoast,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:34:19 2015 UTC,"I personally felt that the episodes were less funny because they were so overly character-focused. Seasons 3-5 were pure comedy gold because the situations and the characters were hilariously dysfunctional on their own merits. For example, the Gang Solves the Gas Crisis: you have Mac, Charlie and Dennis in the absurd plan of trying to profit off gasoline prices (spurred on by running a generator instead of electricity, then buying gas, then selling gas door-to-door). It was topical and hilarious at the same time.   The recent seasons had standout character-focused moments (Mac Day) but their plots seemed to be extensions of the characters."

Take these quotes:   That doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about stars to dispute him.   How often do we find ourselves feeling like we're short on information, left to deciding what's right or wrong based solely on gut feeling?   Mac: I'm not gonna stand here and present some egghead scientific argument based on fact. I'm just a regular dude. I like to drink beer. I love my family. Rock, flag, and eagle - right Charlie?  Charlie: He makes a good point   How often do humans end up forgoing logical arguments in face of a less sound one that is more rhetorically appealing?  Heck, our entire political system is based off of this.   I don’t know how to express myself except through anger and personal attack.   How often do we feel that a situation has escalated so far out of control that the only response we have is to let our limbic system take over -- that only by yelling louder than the other person or showing ourselves to be angrier can we be the true victor?  The gang's ever-present self-obsession is funny only because it point a finger at our own self-obsession.  We only mock their ever-increasing depravity just to get what they want because it creates a tension inside of us about our own selfishness.  No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end.

IASIP,3ayuz1,Drunk_Robana,7,Wed Jun 24 20:24:04 2015 UTC,I was in the same exact boat. I used to not like it as a kid because it meant I missed the Simpsons and all those shows on fox. Then I'd hear that bass line and knew my night was ruined. Now I watch it and love it!
IASIP,3ayuz1,Sofakingcoolstorybro,3,Wed Jun 24 21:12:12 2015 UTC,I used to hate Seinfeld but I recently went about watching it agaon after finishing the last season of iasip and now it's great.
IASIP,3ayuz1,56killa,2,Wed Jun 24 19:59:26 2015 UTC,"Yup. Curb Your Enthusiasm too. Maybe start with that? It's on HBO, so it's cruder than Seinfeld, but not as much as IASIP still."

If you can get past it you'll find it's one of the best shows of all time, equal in absurdity to Sunny.  Also perhaps keep in mind that it was filmed in front of a live audience, so those laughs ain't fake."

IASIP,3ayuz1,Kryeiszkhazek,22,Thu Jun 25 00:06:22 2015 UTC,Time's just doing a broad commercial for Hulu and presenting one of their more recent grabs and presenting it to a new audience.  It's great that IASIP is getting a plug from a more mainstream venue but its still 10 years too late from these people imo.  IASIP will always have a stronger underground base to it. There's been a cult following since the beginning by a small worthier part of the public.
IASIP,3ayuz1,TrapandRelease,7,Wed Jun 24 18:34:24 2015 UTC,"I noticed that too. There was two mentions of hulu, they didn't also list netflix where it's been just as long."

IASIP,3ayuz1,KidCasey,7,Thu Jun 25 15:47:50 2015 UTC,"I think rhe article was saying that if you're still searching for something similar to Seinfeld then you would like IASIP. The article made it very clear that they aren't the same, just similar."
IASIP,3ayuz1,rf32797,3,Wed Jun 24 18:00:38 2015 UTC,"It has more in common than you would immediately think. Both of them are shows ""about nothing."" Specifically, they don't have much of an arching plot, and issues generally are completely resolved by the end of the episode.  Even some of the same character archetypes are used (Charlie and Kramer being the most notable example of both being the kind of crazy, disorganized, wild card).  And then we get to the insane amount of usable quotes from the shows, too. They used... similar types of humor, but Seinfeld was nowhere near as raunchy and foul mouthed as IASIP is."

IASIP,3ayuz1,idosillythings,2,Wed Jun 24 18:56:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I've always described Sunny to people as 'Seinfeld with worse people'.
IASIP,3ayuz1,Bangersss,2,Thu Jun 25 07:39:37 2015 UTC,Thankfully when this was posted in a non fan sub the comments show how many people think this is a ridiculous comparison.
IASIP,3ayuz1,Slack_Irritant,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:56:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's accurate so far as you compare the concepts, rather than viewing It's Always Sunny as being in the same vein of comedy as Seinfeld. They're both about a group of narcissistic, self-centered friends just re-enforcing one another's neuroses at the expense of the world at large. The concept is very similar, but the executions are quite different."

IASIP,3ayuz1,HearshotAtomDisaster,28,Wed Jun 24 18:34:59 2015 UTC,"Man, that's a VERY forced comparison. Just because the premise behind both shows are similar, doesn't mean each of the characters are. None of them are like each other, and comparing Elaine and Dee is just insulting (I honeslty feel you typed this up just because they're both women). Elaine was smart, and (reasonably) responsible who created her own success. Dee is the useless chick."
IASIP,3ayuz1,arcxjo,10,Wed Jun 24 20:34:57 2015 UTC,"But Elaine hated cats, and birds usually don't like cats, either."
IASIP,3ayuz1,HearshotAtomDisaster,3,Wed Jun 24 23:10:30 2015 UTC,Elaine pretty much hated all animals. Dee however has at least owned a cat. That went into her wall.

IASIP,3ayuz1,sehecman,2,Thu Jun 25 04:02:28 2015 UTC,"No, really not that different, Elaine and Dee both have streaks of ridiculous bad luck. Mac like George tries to be a badass and get ahead in life but fails. Dennis is like Jerry in that he notices everyone else's character flaws but fails to notice his own. Frank like Newman often has no real function and is gross/strange. And the Charlie/Kramar comparisons have been done for years."
IASIP,3ayuz1,HearshotAtomDisaster,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:37:48 2015 UTC,"These are all poor comparisons. You're taking the vaguest look at each character and shoehorning them to fit a personal narrative. The only one that I'll give SOME credence to is the Jerry/Dennis one, but Jerry was fully aware of his short comings. Charlie and Kramer make sense if you ignore 90% of the rest of their characters (even in broader terms, Kramer is actually fairly competent and was industrious despite not being very successful, while Charlie is retarded as hell, has practically zero motivation, and really exists just for the expense of the others). Newman was the bad guy. That's all he was. He was Jerrys arbitrary adversary. Frank is not those things, at all.  The rest of your point was pretty ludicrous. If you seriously want to try and keep these comparisons going, just to again, arbitrarily shoehorn these points just to fill your personal narrative on these shows, have at it. But not with me, I'm not buying any of this for a second."

IASIP,3b3vf1,littleinf,12,Thu Jun 25 19:38:06 2015 UTC,"I think he's very, very intelligent. Remember he kept a dossier on Dee from when he was a small child. I would say he is definitely the brains of the group, contrary to what the episode dynamic set up. The problem is that his ideas get derailed, people stop listening to him, and his rage and vanity get in the way of his implementation. Also, he talks about his god hole and gets easily shaken as shown in multiple episodes."
IASIP,3b3vf1,automatedresponse,3,Fri Jun 26 00:42:17 2015 UTC,Pretty sure he got his PH D. in women's studies and his thesis was the use of the D.E.N.N.I.S system

I mean, look at how he leads on Mac.   The D.E.N.N.I.S. System isn't meant to attract life-long partners, or even casual sexual connections. It is a way to absolutely dominate a person's life (Nurture dependence, Neglect emotionally).

IASIP,3asrzo,TreeFittyy,8,Tue Jun 23 05:31:58 2015 UTC,Everclear mixed with Kool-Aid. The ratio completely depends on the intended audience. A decent rule of thumb is 1/4 everclear and 3/4 Kool-Aid. I wouldn't go more than 1/2 and 1/2 unless you're hardcore or trying to prove something. You can up the ratio from 1/4:3/4 if the goal is for the drinker(s) to get drunk.  You can substitute Gatorade or other punch type drinks. Freaking use a MiO or Crystal Light if you're concerned with calories. But the tried and true method involves Kool-Aid.
IASIP,3asrzo,NewMerril,4,Tue Jun 23 05:51:15 2015 UTC,Isn't it everclear and blue powerade?
IASIP,3asrzo,redjimdit,4,Tue Jun 23 13:37:03 2015 UTC,In my experience the Blue Raspberry Lemonade Kool-Aid gives the most accurate colour and tastiest mix.

IASIP,3asrzo,cswanger22,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:50:14 2015 UTC,"Just get the everclear, go to sonic and get the largest blue raspberry slush (or ocean water), drink a third of the slush, fill cup with everclear, poke hole in bottom edge of cup, drain that into an empty gallon jug (with a slush you may have to blow into the straw to create pressure to push the slush out of the cup and into the jug), shake vigorously... Riot punch. (In the show it is blue, hence the ocean water or a blue raspberry slush.)"

IASIP,3aoz3l,ben1204,48,Tue Jun 23 16:46:27 2015 UTC,I think so and when Charlie was old enough to fight him off he became the day man. His mother was the toll troll because uncle Jack paid her to rent the room.
IASIP,3aoz3l,Thegodking,13,Mon Jun 22 10:01:49 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, in the play, Dennis says to Frank, ""No Antonio!"" so it's implied that the toll troll is not his mother but likely a different uncle or other man that his mother rented the room to."

Frank's money is a big advantage. The Boys have to raise some funds for either gas or plane tickets. Normally the gang could just fly direct but their competitive nature combined with their hatred of The Boys will force them to enact some bizarre plan to make their lives hell.    Frank buys plane tickets, and instructs the rest of The Gang to meet him at the airport.  The Boys attempt to sell burweedos  Mac, Dennis and Charlie steal Dee's car and drive to the airport.  Dennis is distracted by a hot flight attendant  Frank burns down the burweedo shop  Dennis is kicked out of the airport for sexual harassment  Charlie panics at the thought of leaving Philly and calls in a bomb threat  Mac is detained after the bomb threat due to wearing a duster and dark sunglasses  Frank actually burned down a homeless shelter. He is arrested.  The Boys forget about the race and play video games    End result is The Boys don't make any money, Frank is in custody, Dee is stuck in Philly, Dennis and Mac are on a no-fly list and Charlie wanders back to the bar.   Worth sharing imo."

The gang because charlie wouldnt leave philly willingly so they tried to bring him in their luggage, and the boys get kicked off the flight after trying to sneak in some ganja and join the mile super high club. I would imagine it would then end with the gang drinking at the bar, the guys drinking at the bar and then when adam moves in to kiss dee, dee dry gags and adam throws up on dee. Mac and adam instead have a bromance and salvage the night complimenting each others' sculpted bods while charlie teaches blake night crawlers, and durs listens in awe to the tales of dennis's love conquests. At the end we find out that all three of the workaholics guys slept with the waitress after being kicked off the flight. Charlie kicks them out of the bar. Frank arrives in amsterdam by way of a boat full of vietnamese immigrants and fires up a spliff immediately with artemis on his arm."

IASIP,3acndg,Homer_JG,15,Fri Jun 19 14:37:16 2015 UTC,"I've always wanted them to make a game of thrones style episode where they all are fighting for sole ownership of the bar. The back stabbing, politicking, and switching alliances of GOT would fit the gangs personality so well."

But if they have already done something similar I doubt they would be able to do it without being very repetitive."
IASIP,3acndg,rscott89,24,Fri Jun 19 14:13:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the episode is pretty much exactly what you want haha. They even fight over a throne. A stinky butt throne."

""It's Gruesome Twosome Tuesday!"", the whole thing with trying to catch a mouse, and the scene at the end where they were all really-out-of-character retarded... I dunno, man.

IASIP,3acndg,NathAndrew_boner,10,Fri Jun 19 18:01:25 2015 UTC,Yup my thoughts exactly. It's like Sunny fan fiction. I remember reading an interview w Charlie about the episode before it aired that retrospectively makes it seem like he kinda felt the same way. (Of course I have no source.)

He approached her while she was pregnant and pitched the idea of Elaine getting fat and then Julia burst into tears. Here's a transcript of the exchange.   Julia: Do you remember when I was about five months pregnant with my youngest and big as a house, and you came up to me and said ""we have a great idea, what if we write it in this season that Elaine just gets fat""...don't get into a car accident over this reminiscence...and, so, what did I do? Burst into tears, automatically. It was like a death sentence. So there's two things I have to say about that. One is you have no interpersonal communication skills--  Jerry: That's not true.  Julia: The second is it was a great idea and we should've done it.  Jerry: I can't believe you're saying this.  Julia: It would've been a great storyline.  Jerry: Yea it would've been pretty funny. And it really shows what a great comic actress you are that you thought about it and eventually got to, that was the funny direction to go.  Julia: I actually, I regret it."

IASIP,3acbo4,MisterWonka,-5,Fri Jun 19 00:08:52 2015 UTC,"What does that change?  It's not about where they got the idea for a fat character...Jerry suggests that it would be funny if Elaine got fat on the show, Julia breaks down because essentially Jerry's calling her fat, and then they talk about how great of a storyline it would have been and how it was a funny direction to go with Elaine.    For Rob, it was about how characters on sitcoms all look better over time; for Jerry, it was making lemons with lemonade when Julia got pregnant (but she didn't want to do it).  Both independently arrived at the idea of having a major character on the sitcom get fat for comedic purposes and I just thought it was an interesting indicator of how similar the comedic sensibilities between the shows."

The scene where Charlie and Dee talk about how Dennis and Mac basically force both of them to behave differently than they normally would. Mac is off trying to be a party boy, but he's still gay and Dennis is trying to capture his past. It's pretty dark that this whole show is about people who are terrible for each other and just stick their head back in the sand to make it work.)  The Gang Gets Analyzed  (Again, the whole gang kind of faces us to their issues personally, and they would probably be better off apart, but through the aspect of Dennis manipulating them all they are kind of tied together. This is probably my favorite episode because I love the observations and reactions from the play of the psychiatry)  The Gang Group Dates  (At the end Dennis again sums up their insanity and group dynamic by pointing out how they live through denial.

IASIP,3a5hyf,bodom2245,0,Thu Jun 18 01:20:07 2015 UTC,"The one thing that bugs me about this is that the physics of it are wrong. Inertia means that the bowl should fall backwards, spilling onto Dennis."

IASIP,3a5hyf,OneManWar,3,Thu Jun 18 05:06:01 2015 UTC,That makes a lot more sense.
IASIP,3a5hyf,popisfizzy,6,Thu Jun 18 05:07:22 2015 UTC,"That actually doesn't make sense. Since the car is so much heavier than Dennis even a small portion of it's kinetic load has a strong effect. The same goes for his bowl. The forward energy of the crash gets transferred into the bowl and into it milk, sending everything flying onto his dash."
IASIP,3a5hyf,jibsand,2,Thu Jun 18 03:17:38 2015 UTC,"That would possibly apply if it were bolted to the car, but it's not. Imagine a pendulum hanging from the roof of a car as it accelerates. It's going to move backwards initially because the car can not readily transfer its momentum to the pendulum. It's a similar situation to the bowl, even though it's not quite a pendulum.  As a more accessible example: when's there last time you were sitting in a car and flew forward when the car quickly accelerated forward. Probably not ever, unless the car braked immediately after. Now imagine you're resting something in the palm of your hand.  [Edit]  I seriously don't know why anyone would downvote this. Look, motion of a pendulum in a car. Due to inertia, from the reference frame of the car there is apparent motion to the right when the car moves left. The exact same principle would apply to a bowl."

IASIP,3a5hyf,oceanfr0g,4,Wed Jun 17 19:05:06 2015 UTC,"The point is the person eating cereal hasn't actually caused an accident. They may be coordinated and capable enough to eat and pay attention to the road. The person on the bike going apeshit and trying to start shit in the name of safety and condemn someone over something that could potentially happen is acting a lot more volatile and dangerous. Circling a vehicle, then staying behind to tattle-tell, yelling at other drivers is also a very dangerous, stupid thing to do on the road. Furthermore, he didn't know who the person driving was and approaching threateningly could have ended very badly for him if he decided to throw a tantrum at the wrong person."

IASIP,3a2q3x,somethingindoing63,22,Wed Jun 17 02:28:25 2015 UTC,Not when there is innocent children involved. It should be illegal to not get your children vaccinated like it's illegal to not feed and take care of them.
IASIP,3a2q3x,NFresh6,-7,Wed Jun 17 02:40:39 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I agree with you, but it does set a precedent.  Making it illegal to not vaxx could lead to making it illegal to have an abortion, as an example.    Believe it or not a lot of people believe the right to free choice still exists.  You can choose to murder someone.  You're free to do that.  You have to live with the consequences, but you're still free to murder ;)"
IASIP,3a2q3x,somethingindoing63,10,Wed Jun 17 02:52:31 2015 UTC,"My point is the children don't have a choice. You're affecting someone else's life by your choice to not get your children vaccinated. The same thing as we don't give a parent the choice to neglect their children and let them die, not go to school, etc. It's illegal. We're already doing it. It's a no-brainer that we need to add vaccinations to that list."
IASIP,3a2q3x,NFresh6,-10,Wed Jun 17 02:59:28 2015 UTC,"If 95% of the US population was vaccinated, and a child who wasn't vaccinated got a disease, how would it affect other children?  At the same time, said unvaccinated child gets sick, infects others, some deaths occur because of this, the parents are obviously at fault and, again, have to live with the consequences of their actions.  Which in this case would probably be gross negligence and perhaps manslaughter/murder.  I mean, they aren't hurting people who are vaccinated, are they?  Correct me if I'm wrong, seriously.. could an unvaccinated child give a vaccinated child a disease?  Which makes my point.. if you choose to not vaccinate a child, you choose to live with the consequences, should something happen.  People who vaccinate their children have literally nothing to worry about.  The same as people who don't murder people have nothing to worry about.  It's all a choice.  EDIT:  I'm comparing people who don't vaccinate to murderers.  It's a terribly stupid decision to make in both cases.  It still doesn't change the fact that they were free to make that decision."
IASIP,3a2q3x,somethingindoing63,9,Wed Jun 17 03:39:30 2015 UTC,Some children have immune diseases that keep them from getting vaccines. They depend on others getting the vaccine so they dont catch shit.

IASIP,3a2q3x,buffalomurricans,7,Wed Jun 17 12:13:28 2015 UTC,You realize that the law is very clear in that if you don't want to vaccinate your kids you can just homeschool them and not do it right?

If you write a script and put as much time into this as OP did, I'll upvote it. This guy loves IASIP so much he made a script.

IASIP,39wy1p,sedsnewoldg,8,Mon Jun 15 15:40:59 2015 UTC,I kind of wish that they had ended it...just slightly differently. It was so brilliant up to a certain point...and then it kind of felt like they had this AMAZING idea but no clue how to tie it all up. So we just got a kind of watered down do it all type wrap up.  There was one point where they could have just abruptly rolled the credits and it would have made it damn near a perfect movie for my tastes. With that said - it would probably infuriate most people who prefer a clean tied up ending. Ah well...just rambling now haha
IASIP,39wy1p,Lugits,2,Mon Jun 15 16:44:06 2015 UTC,What part do you think it should have ended at?

Could go either way. READ ON AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION  I thought the perfect ending would have been cut to credits right after his assistant gets shot... show a few seconds of the cops rolling up to the scene and thats it. Everything after that seemed kind of contrived and pointless unless you 'HAD' to know how it all ended or if he got away with it, etc. Just felt like it was all downhill after that moment.   Personally, I thought he was going to shoot his assistant himself, so the sudden shots were a decent twist for me.  I dont know - just my personal feeling that the last 5-10 mins just cheapened an otherwise amazing effort. Maybe I'm missing some other subtle implication that makes the REAL ending more satisfying though..."
IASIP,39wy1p,inexcess,2,Mon Jun 15 19:33:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's odd that the guy in the SUV didn't shoot him, but chose to shoot the assistant. Also, I would have found it incomplete of it had ended at that point. I'm glad it didn't."

Just watched this episode and I think it's become my new favourite and I knew there was an undertone of cynicism about the show not winning an award. Gutted there's no answer yet. Not sure about that particular reference but, I was thinking the other bar (Sudz) is a reference to Scrubs? (Black best friend, loud vibrant colours, the will they/won't they protagonists) But the only thing that doesn't connect is the customers laughing and awwing, an obvious reference to a laugh track that scrubs doesn't have.

IASIP,39rzg4,Goiter_music,17,Sun Jun 14 04:35:24 2015 UTC,"Found several articles but none that I thought would be what you're referencing. Basically, each episode revolves around relatable ideas and the unrelatable responses of The Gang, with the intention of a ""reset"" button at the end of each episode, like with Full House, but inverted. Everything is back to its normal shitty self by the end of an episode.   From a script point of view, I suppose you could break it down as something roughly like:  Setup: the gang has an idea/comes across a situation that should require no or minimal action. They decide to act, anyway.  Focus: once the issue has been presented, it's handed off to 1-3 characters who would have the most investment in the issue.  Complication: the gang inevitably meets complications, either of circumstance, personal ego, or clashing ideals with other members of the group.  Intersection: often, the subplot B that the remaining characters are dealing with somehow intertwines with the primary plot, allowing all characters a say/shitty interaction on the topic.  Faux-solution: the gang comes to a ""solution"" or understanding of an issue or problem that would seem to be a great idea in a typical sitcom.  Twist/conclusion: they are inevitably brought low by their own failures or the reality of a situation. Whatever high or goal they've reached is rendered incorrect or obsolete. They give up. Reset achieved. Tune in next week.  To avoid jumping the shark, the show is known to go off-formula, particularly after season 7. They tend to intentionally play with style and presentation, often almost providing a meta hat-tip to the audience about ""going off book."""

If she thinks her exterior doesn't match her interior world, to the point where she takes steps to modify her exterior in order to present herself as something she was not born to be, then that doesn't seem that far from a transgendered person changing their exterior (albeit in a far more drastic way) to match their mental conception of themselves.   I think it's an odd issue, culture is something you can choose, and changing personal attributes for other reasons isn't all that controversial. I don't claim to understand this woman, and personally think she has mental problems, but what she has done is far less drastic than someone who was born biologically male who undergoes sexual reassignment. The difference is that every transgendered person I've met has been up front about their choice, where she has been living a lie. That and how much of a hair trigger topic race is in this country."

There is no such thing as transracial and it's ridiculous to even consider or compare.

IASIP,39l0yv,StrategicSarcasm,2,Fri Jun 12 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"Except there's a ton of science and studies to explain how being transgender is a real thing and none for being ""transracial"" (which is already a word btw that does not mean this). Worth noting too that this woman never claimed to be ""transracial,"" she just straight up lied about being black and who her relatives were. And also that trans/non-binary gender identities have existed everywhere throughout human history, and you can even find evidence in the animal kingdom, etc. Being transgender is hardly a new concept, just as homosexuality didn't spring out of nowhere in the 70s when it became a more prominent civil rights issue. Gay people have always existed and so have trans people.   Here are some sources to help you understand what being transgender actually is and some of the biology/science:  http://www.transgendercare.com/medical/hormonal/brain_sex_diff.htm  http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20032-transsexual-differences-caught-on-brain-scan.html#.VXNngkYXJaY  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2754583/  http://www.cakeworld.info/transsexualism/what-helps/srs  http://www.religioustolerance.org/transsexu3.htm  http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm"
IASIP,39l0yv,juniorkickstart,0,Fri Jun 12 20:24:46 2015 UTC,"I mean obviously there's no studies about ""transracial"" studies because so few people have bothered to come out as it. That's not to say it's legitimate, but immediately dismissing something new because it's not familiar is kinda stupid.  Now I'm aware of the brain scans and stuff (although way too many supporters aren't), but I guess the point I'm trying to make is that I'm not really sure how the two are necessarily connected. Obviously if someone's brain is like a woman they're going to like women a lot and have a propensity for more stereotypically ""woman"" things, but that doesn't mean they necessarily ""are"" one mentally.   It may be a pointless distinction, but I feel like we could be missing the point. With higher rates of male-to-female transsexuals and the higher suicide rates and various other social issues, isn't it likely that ""gender dysphoria"" isn't really about gender at all, but some kind of obscure mental disorder that is only tangentally related to gender at all, but is coincidentally helped along by various gender-related stereotypes?  I dunno, maybe I'm overthinking this."
IASIP,39l0yv,StrategicSarcasm,3,Sat Jun 13 02:57:02 2015 UTC,"Just as likely it's just what it is instead though. Why not just take someone's word for it? Why would it matter to you?   It's true we could find in the future there's more to the picture, but for the time being, don't you think it's a bit condescending to say ""hey I know you've been struggling with this and you're taking steps to make your life the way you want it to be, but i think you're really just mentally ill, you should listen to me""? I mean, that's essentially what you're implying. Or maybe one day we'll find that people are sometimes just born a different gender in their head than in their body. Impossible to say, we'll have to see, for now though why not just be respectful?"
IASIP,39l0yv,juniorkickstart,3,Sat Jun 13 03:23:45 2015 UTC,"Why not just take someone's word for it? Why would it matter to you?   Because I care about being right? I mean I don't even get the question. If someone says they're a different race, or a wolf, or secretly the smartest person on the earth it would matter. Why would it be any difference with gender?   don't you think it's a bit condescending to say ""[...] i think you're really just mentally ill, you should listen to me""   Lots of people have mental illnesses. I have two. It's not condescending to state the truth, assuming it is the truth. Transsexuals clearly need extra assistance, what with the suicide rates and whatnot. Simply classifying them needing assistance is only natural. If anything, you're being condescending by saying they need to be pampered.   maybe one day we'll find that people are sometimes just born a different gender in their head than in their body.   That's sort of the crux of the issue though, isn't it? Gender is a completely meaningless term, except when applied to sex. It's a culturally created concept with no scientific basis. Ergo whatever mental changes exist in transsexuals are some sort of obscure mental illness."
IASIP,39l0yv,StrategicSarcasm,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:02:55 2015 UTC,"But why care about being right about something that will never affect you? It's like caring if people are gay - unless it's happening to you, why bother other people about it? Let them make their choices. If they think they're a wolf or the smartest person in the world, why argue? It just seems like such a waste of energy to care so much about being 'right' about something that's so subjective. That's my personal opinion though, and you're certainly entitled to have one as well.  It's true a lot of people have mental illnesses, but you are assuming it's the truth in the case of transsexuals as well. Which it might not be. In any case, why should YOU be able to tell any other person if they have a mental illness or not? And then tell them what they should do about it instead of what they chose? I think that's what I find condescending - so many people try to write transsexuals off as mentally ill people simply because they find it offensive. You might not be doing so, but many who share your view do.   Also, how am I saying they should be pampered? I'm just trying to argue for the right of trans people to exist the way they want to, and for them to be free to pursue that without discrimination.  Is gender completely meaningless though, really? Even if it's culturally created, is it still not scientifically measurable? Perhaps you meant it's got no biological basis? I mean we can never jump outside of culture to try and see, so how could we ever be sure? In time perhaps science will move forward on this and we will see whatever the truth may be, but until then, why not be respectful of whatever mental changes are going on? Isn't that how it should be with most mental illnesses? Let people get the help they want, and try to be respectful in the meantime?   I'm asking a lot of questions here, mostly because I don't know much about gender or transsexuals, since I'm not one and never will be I've never really cared to study it much. I just think they should be able to be whoever they want to be and to live their life the way they choose, just like any other human should be able to."
IASIP,39l0yv,ns156,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:16:39 2015 UTC,"But why care about being right about something that will never affect you?    I already answered this question. I can't exactly clarify it further than I already have. Like do you want a rundown of the exact neural processes that cause humans to think? That's the only possible way it can be clarified further, and I'm not qualified to talk about it.   If they think they're a wolf or the smartest person in the world, why argue?    Because they're clearly not. I'm trying to parse this, but I can't imagine someone being so completely apathetic to literally everything. It's like some ultra soccer mom logic. Yeah, everyone's the smartest person in the world, just go about your day thinking about it. Let's all live life in our own little fantasy worlds where we never have to grow or progress either as individuals or as a species. Yeah, sounds great.   In any case, why should YOU be able to tell any other person if they have a mental illness or not? And then tell them what they should do about it instead of what they chose?   You're putting a lot of emphasis on me. Like I declared myself supreme medical expert. I'm saying that qualified individuals with more experience than me should examine the situation and do repeated scientific studies to determine the exact nature and ideal cure, and subsequently share the information in order to make the world a better place.    how am I saying they should be pampered?   Definitions exist for a reason. If something is a rock, you call it a rock. If something is retarded, you call it retarded. It sure is a shame to have a condition that makes it hard to process information, but claiming it's not a bad condition to have is blatant lies. It's why so many people have issues with PC crap like ""differently abled"" and ""special needs"", because it implies that retarded people aren't people struggling with a debilitating condition, but just people who think differently.  Similarly, by getting in uproar against transsexualism being classified as a mental disorder (and, since I'm getting petty about definitions, there are probably other more specific terms  but I don't know enough to know which one), you're acting like they're just people who need to live life on their own terms, even though the high suicide rates and such imply some sort of issue that needs support. If they're just people who have different goals, they would be best left alone. If they actually do have a mental disorder, they need help, and denying the use of the term ""mental disorder"" can only be harmful.   Even if it's culturally created, is it still not scientifically measurable?   It's practically by definition not scientifically measurable. Culture implies something created by humans or other sapient species, and if it was created by humans than that means there is no inherent bias in the universe towards that thing. Science is about studying repeatable and falsifiable constants. Like gravity, everything that has mass exerts gravity on everything else, be it the Sun, Earth, or your brain cells. Evolution is a pseudo-random progress that, nonetheless, has constant clues and hints towards its proof.   Cultural things like paintings and social ettiquette are created by humans, have no consistency or proof. Two animal species that lived in two different forests might evolve similar things, but there's no way to tell how two different tribes will end up culturally. One group might think boys need to have a wife to ascend to manhood, another might think boys need to eat sperm in order to truly become men. Both examples exist in the real world, and there's no way to scientifically measure manhood in relation to both examples."

I've also watched every episode 40+ times, not including the newer seasons 7-10 but I've gotten at least 10 viewings from those. I feel so much better knowing someone else obsessively watches this. I know all the little moments in the background and the exact delivery of lines by just random actors in the episode.

For this last season I had to buy every episode through Google video and watch on my tablet, in my truck, after work (after downloading the show of course).

Let's assume he owns 60% of the company. That would make the whole company worth $52,000,000. Frank, as I understand it, essentially sold the company for parts to the Japanese. So if Frank only got half of what the company was worth, he made $26,000,000 just off that.   Before that episode, it's up for grabs how much he already had. He bought a half million dollar car as a prank, so if say he at least had ~$30,000,000 already. That puts him at a total of a conservative estimate of $56,000,000 total"

IASIP,3929h1,realmadrid314,9,Mon Jun 8 19:05:07 2015 UTC,Mac and Charlie in this season are basically retarded and completely unaware of anything.   I can't name one episode in Season 3 where Mac and Charlie aren't dumb and unaware.

IASIP,3929h1,mrglow,4,Mon Jun 8 19:35:37 2015 UTC,"I think the cult has less to do with how dumb they are, but how much control Dennis has over the two of them. He controls Mac's weight and he constantly talks about ruining Charlie's hopes and dreams. Early in season 10 everyone thought we were going to see a monumental meltdown from Dennis because he was starting to lash out, and I think the episode is honestly more about Dennis' insanity in setting up a cult to control his two best friends and having one of the cult members commit suicide. I mean Charlie fell for Invigaron and Mac and Dennis both bought a time share.   I'm not opposed to your opinion, I can see where you are coming from. I just think that the issues are more with the pacing and style than with the characters. With a different style, the characters will always be off. I just don't think they are any more stupid or unaware."

IASIP,38rqpl,NewMerril,33,Sun Jun 7 12:50:45 2015 UTC,I can totally understand all of the other suggestions! Which is why I feel the need to disagree!  I'm going with Tommy (Charlie's alleged son). He played the role of a terrible young person so well. I crack up every single time that he says:   if you don't [something] then I'll tell my mom that you took me to a black person's house.   He said it so genuinely! I guess I don't see enough child actors play godawful people enough.
IASIP,38rqpl,awesomegrizzlybear,19,Sat Jun 6 07:33:28 2015 UTC,Wasn't he also Jake in The Office? That last episode where his mother taught him how to grind properly was magical :')

IASIP,38rqpl,ParmesanPlatoon,11,Sat Jun 6 07:10:03 2015 UTC,"Yes lol he had maybe like 7 seconds of screen time.  To me he's one of the reasons I really liked that episode,  also Charlies reaction when he he just disappears"
