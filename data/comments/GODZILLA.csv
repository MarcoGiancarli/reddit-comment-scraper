When you bring up the listing now, it says that the item listing is over because the item is no longer for sale.  So either the guy changed his mind, or he found a local buyer."
GODZILLA,3dz2wx,Chickenman456,2,Mon Jul 20 18:21:14 2015 UTC,That's a big godzilla model to the left.

GODZILLA,3dy7wu,BobaFetted,2,Mon Jul 20 15:16:57 2015 UTC,I was in Boston yesterday and saw this! Quite the coincidence!
GODZILLA,3dzxii,daggerwolf2,7,Mon Jul 20 21:58:13 2015 UTC,Stock footage and it's aimed towards children.
GODZILLA,3dzxii,jorzilla,2,Mon Jul 20 22:25:31 2015 UTC,I would think the majority of Godzilla is aimed towards children.
GODZILLA,3dzxii,Nopeyesok,3,Mon Jul 20 23:54:32 2015 UTC,"1969 and onwards, yes. A turn around in 1984. This movie came out in 1969 and signaled a down trend in the franchise as kid fare only."
GODZILLA,3dzxii,jorzilla,4,Mon Jul 20 23:58:14 2015 UTC,"Yep. Starting with King Kong vs. Godzilla, Godzilla films weren't necessarily kid's movies, just movies that could be enjoyed BY kids. This trend accelerated with Monster Zero, reversed a bit with DAM, but was in full ""kid's movie"" swing from Godzilla's Revenge. The Mechagodzilla films again reversed it a bit, especially Terror, but by then there were a dozen other problems that basically meant the series had to take a break."
GODZILLA,3dzxii,Volksgrenadier,3,Tue Jul 21 00:39:54 2015 UTC,"it's ok. I honestly wouldn't mind if they made, like, a cartoon remake of it or something. If, as a kid, you never fantasized about getting to hang out with Godzilla then you're lying"
GODZILLA,3dzxii,specXeno,2,Tue Jul 21 01:49:31 2015 UTC,I still do
GODZILLA,3dzxii,Chickenman456,2,Tue Jul 21 02:39:54 2015 UTC,"It was one of the first I ever saw at like 4 years old and it got me hooked on them all, so I love it.  Also dat Gabara"
GODZILLA,3dzxii,Wilibine,3,Tue Jul 21 01:24:44 2015 UTC,"Because. You MUST hate it and follow the Godzilla's Revenge hate circlejerk.

GODZILLA,3dxvay,daggerwolf2,3,Mon Jul 20 16:16:46 2015 UTC,so many people are shitting on this game
GODZILLA,3dxvay,aleon33,4,Mon Jul 20 17:22:12 2015 UTC,"Cause its shit, they cashed in on nostalgia and fandom."
GODZILLA,3dxvay,grave33,3,Mon Jul 20 20:53:07 2015 UTC,seems like so many easy fixes would have made this game stellar. It's as if no one every got to the creators and mentioned anything.
GODZILLA,3dxvay,aleon33,2,Mon Jul 20 23:18:23 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, I was really hoping this game was gonna be like Arkham Asylum and prove you could do godzilla right."
GODZILLA,3dxvay,grave33,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:14:32 2015 UTC,"It was a quick cash in   Even the graphics, the best part of the game would have been subpar in say 2007"
GODZILLA,3dxvay,Ice_tail,4,Mon Jul 20 23:31:27 2015 UTC,"I love how this game stays true to Godzilla and the history behind him, but gameplay wise I can see how it's terrible. For a PS4 game it's no where near its potential and it also seems to be very repetitive. The mechanics are too simple and the environment extremely boring. I'd rather have the Godzilla: Save the Earth on Xbox :/"
GODZILLA,3dxvay,Louisville117,3,Mon Jul 20 19:43:25 2015 UTC,"I liked it... I've easily put in 3x as many hours as I have Arkham Knight (in fact I haven't even touched the game since Godzilla came out). it's a lot of fun if you give it a chance. yes it's repetitive, the controls are strange at first and the graphics aren't top notch.... but that doesn't take away from the fun I'm having stomping around, smashing buildings and taking down monsters along the way.  at this point, I think these reviews are just jumping on the band wagon, ""Everyone says they hate it, so I'm not even going to give it half a chance""  the review says it's not fun at all... I'm glad I don't subscribe to his lack of wonder and amazement, cause I'm having a good time. oh well."
GODZILLA,3dxvay,CHEEZYSPAM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:41:28 2015 UTC,"Haters gonna hate, I suppose. I love this game. The monster battles keep me on my toes, and the destruction portion is quite cathartic. I can understand why someone might not like this game, but god damn, the amount of shit being dumped on it is totally unjustified."
GODZILLA,3dxvay,MaraSargon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:19:51 2015 UTC,"I would put Godzilla up there with a high end PS2 title or (at best) a low end PS3 one.   I'd really like to see what this PS2 game of his looks like. In any case, graphics wise, it looks great to me.  What bugs me is how small the areas look. Also, the tail by itself doesn't any damage, you need to actually tail whip for it to do anything. :/  Knowing it's only got online multiplayer, I may just get it for PS3 on a discount since I'm not really a fan of online multiplayer, not that I know anyone who'd want to play this with me."
GODZILLA,3dxvay,Moulinoski,-3,Mon Jul 20 18:19:56 2015 UTC,"The hell!? That little 13 year old made this article? No wonder he's blasting this game, he wasn't living thru the age when the millennium series was first coming out, which adds onto his lack of understanding this game is pretty much a nostalgic thing."

GODZILLA,3dwpo0,jcraig3k,4,Mon Jul 20 04:07:45 2015 UTC,"Those damn bridges. I've found the best way to get 100% on every stage is to play as Biollante. She destroys absolutely everything. I was at 107 meters when I got to the final stage.  Also, I agree. The game is very, very far from perfect but I cannot stop playing it. Best Godzilla game ever, IMO."
GODZILLA,3dwpo0,rabidassbaboon,2,Mon Jul 20 12:44:48 2015 UTC,So I have an unrelated question about the game; I have a question mark in area 5 or 6 and I keep playing it but nobody attacks me the entire time. How do I make that monster appear? And yes old film mode is greatly satisfying
GODZILLA,3dwpo0,thatloudblondguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:11:52 2015 UTC,"Do more data collection, and make sure you've unlocked Jet Jaguar. In Area 1 while playing ""Go Ashore,"" destroy the entire left side as fast as you can to get 50% destruction, then immediately destroy the generator. Jet Jaguar will appear at the mouth of the harbor. After that, you'll be able to encounter him in other stages.  As for the other monsters, I was able to get most of them right off the bat, but Biollante and Destoroyah didn't start appearing for me until I was over 50% data collection, and Kiryu won't appear at all until at least 90%. (SMG takes his place until then.)"
GODZILLA,3dwpo0,MaraSargon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:42:50 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, the ""bullshit bridges"" as I like to call them. They're almost as annoying as Godzilla Generations' trees. Although I find 100 meter Destoroyah to be quite easy. 100 meter Battra Larva is the bastard I always have trouble with. Actually, Battra Larva is just a bastard in general.  I played 24 fps for a little while and I do like it, but the game was just going too slow while I was trying to unlock stuff."

The graphics are sub-par, the controls are weird, there should be a block button but there isn't, and the levels are all basically the same.  However, as a huge Godzilla fan, I really enjoy the game. It truly feels like you are Godzilla. Great fan-service, and just a fun experience in short bursts. You won't play this game for hours at a time.  Don't buy a PS4 for this game.

GODZILLA,3drtar,Tater_Tot_Cassarole,2,Sun Jul 19 21:03:24 2015 UTC,"I think everybody's hoping for extra/dlc characters.  Personally I think if they did add more characters via updates (like they did with '64 Godzilla) it would breathe a bit more life into the game. Or perhaps different locations; all the stages in the game are based on settings in (from what I can gather) mostly the Heisei era movies. So basically Japan, and just japan.  I wouldn't mind Zilla being added. I wouldn't mind Gamera (lol yeah right). I wouldn't mind the handful of monsters they left out for some reason."
GODZILLA,3drtar,Anggul,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:21:50 2015 UTC,"I feel like the thing people don't understand is that the game play is supposed to be slow, and mildy clunky. That was the objective from the beginning. To quote on quote ""recreate the movies"". The fights are fun, the destruction is awesome and the graphics aren't half bad. It is true that it is repetitive, but I loved every moment of it. Plus you can play the campaign as every single monster. I bought a PS4 just for this game and I don't regret it at all."

GODZILLA,3drtar,NeoUltimo,0,Sun Jul 19 14:19:39 2015 UTC,IMO the new game is terrible and ALOT of people share this opinion but a very small minority of people somehow find entertainment in this ugly clunky game

I mean, yeah, Hedroah is even worse, but at least that thing can get electrocuted or dehydrated to hell or somethig.

Because Mothra is pretty chill."

Not only is her/his final form pretty menacing but she can break down to smaller forms and mess us up that way. Guess we should start making freeze weapons eh?   Ghidorah- Ghidorah just wants to see this world burn (He's a man of his word) and life become extinguished. Pretty spooky."
