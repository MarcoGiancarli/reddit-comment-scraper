trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,PerfectHair,13,Tue Jul 21 07:33:05 2015 UTC,"I binge-watched both seasons last week, because people on the internet reddit said good things about it.  Despite the inevitable masses of shitty people, the collective on reddit (at least non-default-sub reddit) is unmatched by any other large online community/forum. You guys rock. Me, too. I rock, too.  Anyway. I say this because reddit's collective suggestions have rarely lead me astray. BoJack Horseman is one of the best cartoons I've ever seen. Really well-crafted show. 10/10 - seconding /u/PerfectHair - watch it if you haven't!"
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,CatBagels,3,Tue Jul 21 13:14:11 2015 UTC,"I literally just closed the tab I opened for the BH subreddit before reading your comment, and as I read what you said, I realized that you're completely right. Reddit's never lied to me about what's amazing and what's horse shit.  I had brushed the show off just a minute ago for being irrelevant and likely uninteresting to me, but you've just convinced me to watch it. I don't think I've ever seen this much unadulterated praise for a show before, so I think I'm in for a treat... thank you for the well-written argument, my friend!  P.S. cats + bagels, just yes"

trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,Shuriken95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:14:50 2015 UTC,Just came out on July 17. Netflix advertises it at the top of their screen now
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,thabe331,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:24:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I suppose you don't browse /r/television, /r/netflix or that dedicated sub, also no twitter or other social media about this series or Netflix. Easy to miss this then. But it's out just since last Friday"
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,Schnabeltierchen,3,Tue Jul 21 16:17:02 2015 UTC,Netflix actually emailed me to tell me it was out. I don't think I've ever been so excited to get corporate promotional junk mail in my life.
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:57 2015 UTC,Yup pretty much. I don't follow most TV related stuff; Bojack is one of the only shows I've really watched lately.
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,Shuriken95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:21 2015 UTC,Is it aimed at the same audience as Rick and Morty?
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,Level100ProtWarrior,7,Tue Jul 21 19:16:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is at all. Rick and Morty is R-rated high-concept sci-fi rigmarole. Bojack Horseman is an extended character study in the guise of a dark comedy. If I had to compare it to something ... Californication or Mad Men, but with more comedy."
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,alexanderwales,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:17:30 2015 UTC,It's closer to Archer than Rick and Morty. I love R&M but can't stand Archer and BoJack.
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,scy1192,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:25:02 2015 UTC,"Not really. Rick and Morty has thought provoking moments every once in a while, but that's not the focus of the show. Without spoiling anything, Bojack Horseman is much more somber and grounded in reality despite having anthropomorphic animals and ridiculous plot lines. The animation style is unique and there are some stunning scenes, such as the into sequence. There's also a lot of background gags, and the newest season reminds me of Arrested Development because of the intertwining plot lines of various characters.   However, it's one of my favorite cartoons ever already and it's definitely on par with Rick and Morty in terms of quality. Definitely watch it."
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,ThatParanoidPenguin,0,Tue Jul 21 23:58:37 2015 UTC,More or less. Specifically the cross-section between R&M and Mad Men.
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,lightningrod14,0,Tue Jul 21 19:41:16 2015 UTC,"Good to know, thanks."
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,Level100ProtWarrior,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:43:05 2015 UTC,I... dunno. Maybe?
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,PerfectHair,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:36:34 2015 UTC,Let me rephrase that - is it intentionally disgusting and juvenile for the lulz? Because Rick and Morty was a 100% turn off within the first 5 minutes because of that.
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,Level100ProtWarrior,3,Tue Jul 21 19:41:06 2015 UTC,"Rick and Morty is my favorite comedy show of all time, so I'm sorry you feel that way. I really appreciate the wit and smart comedy the show has, in addition to the darkness of the show adding a lot to think about. There are feels and it really resonates with me. The burps are just part of the character, not the jokes."
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,t337c213,3,Wed Jul 22 01:43:39 2015 UTC,The first episode tends to lean on gross-out and shock humor. The show gets a lot better later on though
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,aveman101,-2,Tue Jul 21 20:29:54 2015 UTC,"seconded, thankfully they took out Rick's incessant burping  edit: ITT: fans of Rick's burping? I... I'm at a loss here, guys"
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,scy1192,2,Tue Jul 21 22:25:54 2015 UTC,"They never took out anything, they just exaggerated all the characters in the first episode to quickly establish their quirks and character types."
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,multiusedrone,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:37:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, maybe I'll actually watch it then."
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,Gimlis_Axe,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:45:20 2015 UTC,No.
trendingsubreddits,3e1owb,PerfectHair,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:45:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, maybe I'll give it a chance then. At first I had zero interest in it because it didn't seem like it was marketed towards me, but redditors have raved about it lately. The last show that redditors loved that I watched was R&M, which I hated for the above reasons, so I was on the fence as to whether or not I actually wanted to watch it."

trendingsubreddits,3dlmu7,Walter_Bishop_PhD,25,Fri Jul 17 23:57:27 2015 UTC,Could you just redirect AskAnAmerican to anywhere on Reddit and get the same result?
trendingsubreddits,3dlmu7,PerfectHair,11,Fri Jul 17 12:20:34 2015 UTC,"I see your point, a lot of reddit is already American. However a big focus of the sub is to clear up misconceptions or stereotypes about Americans. The answers given on the sub are not what you'd expect from a random question on /r/askreddit. For example /u/RMS_Gigantic answers a question about where to travel to find the real america. The rest of the answers to the travel question can be found here   The best place to get a taste of American life is in the suburbs. They don't get international recognition, so there's not much for you to take pictures of that people back in Britain will immediately recognize, but it's a more authentic taste for how most Americans live: giant parking lots, cheap goods, big vehicles.  To give one example of how one could theoretically reach an American suburb or countryside, we've mentioned the California Zephyr train that Amtrak runs elsewhere in these answers. That train mostly stops in major cities as far as I know, but in Chicago's Union Station there is also a commuter rail line that's run by Metra, which operates only in Chicago and its suburbs. Metra is one of the few, if not only, commuter rail divisions to actually hole punch paper tickets, and the line that I'm thinking of that runs into and out of Chicago each day is called the Heritage Corridor. I took the Metra Heritage Corridor every day when I had a job in Chicago while living in a suburb south of the city. I began the day by hopping aboard the train in Joliet (after a 30-minute drive there via some back roads from an even smaller town named Minooka, Illinois), which is on the opposite end of that particular line. Joliet, Illinois is kind of sketchy in places, but then again the same could also be said of Chicago.  Now, Joliet has virtually null in the way of buses or other public transportation that I know of, and Minooka's options are even fewer. However, Minooka and Joliet can both also be reached by taking Interstate 80 and simply taking exits that you might otherwise never consider outside of food places or hotels. Many of those minor highway exits, if you explore a little more, will show you the big box stores with gargantuan parking lots that the US is known for, or the suburbs with surprisingly large houses with American flags flying outside that are rather common when you're several miles outside of a city--something like an hour or an hour and a half driving away from the city via a highway by car. You might also pass by lower-income areas such as trailer parks or farms. If you find a US Route or a state highway, those are also bound to be roads that people will travel simply as part of their daily errand runs, which will lead to a lot more small businesses and other down-to-earth things than you'll find in the US metropolises.  Suburbs are also recommendable since you mention wanting to see the gun aspect of life here: the suburbs are generally more gun-friendly than cities. You see, suburbs in the US generally lean towards the political right while cities generally lean towards the political left, so suburbs are more likely to have a more open gun culture than large cities.  Again, you won't find any landmarks or helpful tour guides, and it might sound crazy if you suggest the idea to someone else without the full explanation, but it's certainly a more authentic and everyday experience as far as American life goes."

Saying to just create new posts is not the issue at all, it's a much bigger problem that it don't think can get resolved at this point because of the demographic of the sub that's given it a complete change from what it used to be, and the fact that mods police and ban users on the grounds that they are not friendly enough. And you said that those complaints bug you when it could be as simple as posting content they like."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:31:23 2015 UTC,"Oh and I just saw that you also made the other comment too, I'm sorry but you did come off as rude in both. I was trying to be nice in my reply but I didn't appreciate the attitude.  I'm not fighting at all, I'm just tired of others trying to shut down conversations especially with a presumptuous tone. Read back your comments and you'll see."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:09:01 2015 UTC,"You're reading too far into this. Look around, I've been commenting to you back and forth most of the afternoon. I'm not trying to shut down anything, in fact I specifically asked someone to invite you to the 25+ chat sub because I can sympathize.   And yes, if it's just a matter of ""I don't like the topics"" you can post different stuff. That is a fix if that's literally the only issue at hand, and that's all I was saying. If it's a question of the mod team? Hell yeah, have at if that's what you think. I didn't really question any arguments about the demographic, except to say that I just kinda pick and choose my conversations. I'm definitely not debating any of that."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,iamaneviltaco,2,Thu Jul 16 23:58:30 2015 UTC,"Ok I can respect that. Maybe I am reading too much into it. I guess I am just weary of it. Thanks for explaining your point. I appreciate you letting me know about the subreddit that's for 25 and over, I'll see you over there if you join.  I don't agree with the latter part of what you said, I already explained my bit on what I thought of it so I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on that."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,-1,Fri Jul 17 00:10:51 2015 UTC,"We can't control what goes on outside of our sub, man.   As long as people are nice and friendly within the sub, they're okay with us. We can't ban people just because they are unfriendly in other subs."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,EmptyOfIt,2,Fri Jul 17 00:38:19 2015 UTC,"As long as people are nice and friendly within the sub, they're okay with us.   Unless they make a joke that deals with a subject the mods hold dear to their heart, even though the joke in no way demeaned the subject."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:07:24 2015 UTC,"What, of course you can't. Who said that? I'm saying, condensed down, that some users are really not as nice as they pretend to be in the sub. I find it strange how being nice is demanded upon, it's almost militant and creepy. The ironic things is that many are not nice but just pretending to be in that sub. It's comes off as fake and hyprocritcal when the mods and users silence, warn and ban those that don't think like you do."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,tizorres,0,Thu Jul 16 17:44:17 2015 UTC,"I don't believe the internet has to be full of hatred. If there are a few subs that force (as you say) kindness then I don't see the horror in that. There is way more hatred on the internet, is having one friendly (even if it's fake) that bad?"
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,iamaneviltaco,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:16:38 2015 UTC,"Especially since for a lot of us the difference is more that reddit in general is a pretty jaded and snarky place. So, we code switch. I tend to be more blunt in defaults, for example. When I'm in one of the more chatty subs? I open up more. That's not an example of fakeness any more than the fact that I don't tend to talk about about recipes in the krav maga subreddit. Time and a place, is all."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,0,Thu Jul 16 17:56:41 2015 UTC,"Who's said that though? That it needs to be full of hatred? No need need to exaggerate. It's the way you guys go about it that it's what people don't like.  I know you are trying to seem innocent of it and like you don't know what people are talking about but this is not the way your sub is run, people getting silenced and banned and you pushing for it to grow constantly and now you are acting like you don't know about it? For many, your sub is the opposite of nice, there's nothing wrong with that but don't pretend otherwise."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,penelopede,0,Thu Jul 16 18:47:11 2015 UTC,"That's kind of how I feel about it.   You can usually get a pretty good conversation going as long as you're friendly and have something to say. Lots of people actually browse the new section, so it won't take too long to get a conversation going that you enjoy.   If you don't like the content, it's so easy to make content you prefer because you can talk about pretty much anything."

trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,all_my_rage,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:56:52 2015 UTC,They're text macros and they're not uncommon. What is your deal
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,2,Thu Jul 16 16:53:07 2015 UTC,so basically /r/teenagers without links.
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,2,Thu Jul 16 20:00:10 2015 UTC,Yeah...
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,tizorres,2,Fri Jul 17 02:03:07 2015 UTC,Not if the mods don't allow it. The funny thing is they highly police other silly things yet not the main focus of the sub.
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,14,Fri Jul 17 02:02:25 2015 UTC,We're actually going through a 'no mod' week test run to see how the community handles low moderation. Doesn't seem to be going to well.
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,tizorres,10,Fri Jul 17 02:17:19 2015 UTC,"Well his has been happening more or less for months, it's just gotten worse over the summer.   The post of Ellen Pao now being a mod on your sub and everyone circlejerking themselves just added the cherry on top.   I used to enjoy the sub but it's just not for me anymore! I had to unsubscribe."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,4,Thu Jul 16 14:32:27 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear that :(
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,laspero,6,Thu Jul 16 13:45:03 2015 UTC,It obviously works for a lot redditors because your subscriber numbers are through the roof.   I guess I am in the minority but I have read and seen others complain and say that they feel similarly.
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,11,Thu Jul 16 14:24:11 2015 UTC,"It's become a platform for people to validate themselves and fish for compliments. Every post is like, ""I'm feeling sad, everyone tell me how great I am so I feel better!?"""
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,jordan_bar,6,Thu Jul 16 14:24:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know how some are not seeing this.    Also, it seems like whenever someone critiques /r/CasualConversation, the mods and users from come out and downvote anything that disagrees and upvotes the mods. It's spilling out of the sub now."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,tizorres,3,Thu Jul 16 14:29:32 2015 UTC,"I also see lots of clickbait. People title their posts with something that might infer something sad happened, like ""So I told my best friend of two years that I like her today..."" and the post literally is just ""... and she feels the same way! Just wanted to share.""  Like it's okay for you to share this but tons of people came here to comfort you or read about what happened and now we're all here to either say ""congratulations"" or ""i don't care""."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,0,Thu Jul 16 16:10:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, hopefully after this test run for lax moderation we can reform the sub a bit. If you like, feel free to stop in our discussion thread about the sub in a couple weeks, voice your concerns.   Anyway, thanks for being honest."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,tizorres,5,Thu Jul 16 19:28:57 2015 UTC,"I think one part of the issue is the demographic of your sub now, it's made up of a lot of teens and their post topics. So I don't think any changes you make will fix that. Nothing wrong with it as long as there's conversations but it's not something I'm personally interested in being part of. It's just a matter of the sub getting too big and not being modded correctly to keep the main focus. I've also read that you guys ban a lot of people when they're not friendly enough? That could be another problem.  I'll still check out the changes you make though."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,3,Thu Jul 16 23:34:18 2015 UTC,I think we have an influx of teens right now because summer. No school and stuff. We don't ban people for who are not friendly. We ban people for being blatantly disrespectful.
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,tizorres,4,Thu Jul 16 14:31:35 2015 UTC,"This has been happening for a long time not just summer, the teens and them taking over the sub I mean.   That's not what I've heard about bans and warnings in your sub."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,iamaneviltaco,2,Thu Jul 16 14:45:26 2015 UTC,"I mean I'm a mod (hell I made the sub), so I kinda know why we ban. I know you can't really trust me but it's a few users words over mine and people are inclined to hate mods thus not trusting what the mods say. For all you know we're banning people left and right just for stuff we don't agree on but I can honestly say that is not going on and if you don't believe me, so be it."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,2,Thu Jul 16 14:50:49 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile I'm 36 and I've had no problems over there. There's enough general chat to make up for it, and amazingly enough teenagers DO use reddit. Pretty easy to just give those threads a pass if I'm not interested.  To each his own, I guess."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,iamaneviltaco,3,Thu Jul 16 14:55:51 2015 UTC,"Like I wrote, I know it works for many redditors but there are some, if not many of us that don't like what this subreddit has become."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,Lord_Michael_Bolton,2,Thu Jul 16 14:59:49 2015 UTC,"Curious if there are any active subs for adults to chat. I mean I know there are subs like /r/redditforgrownups and /r/askmenover30, but you have me wondering if something like that exists for just general conversation.  Seems like that's a niche that could be filled, looking over this thread a bit more. I know I'd jump in there, too. Honestly I just like bsing with people."

We're absolutely open and, as you've stated, many others share your thoughts and aspirations.   The first movement toward making changes is believing that they're possible. You care enough to post here, but do you care enough to put some real effort behind your thoughts?"
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,penelopede,2,Thu Jul 16 16:52:21 2015 UTC,"Really? A long ass time ago when I saw how things were changing for the worst, I made a comment (that got a lot of upvotes) critiquing some aspects of the subreddit and just wanted to get some conversation going on it how it was not being geared towards actual conversations and people a few other points, actual constructive criticism. My comment and the entire thread was deleted shortly after I got a few angry pms from the mods. Is it being allowed now all of a sudden?"
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:02:51 2015 UTC,We have an entire subreddit (/r/ideasforcc) and have re-opened [META] threads within the main sub specifically to invite critique of the sub.    I'm not sure when you posted your thread but we've been promoting /r/ideasforcc since april and the meta tags for a month now.
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,penelopede,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:19:21 2015 UTC,"Your subreddit has a history of not allowing criticism, so people are weary I'm sure for fear of getting blacklisted."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,0,Thu Jul 16 19:01:14 2015 UTC,Is it really not allowing criticism when we're specifically asking for feedback?    edit. consider this my personal invitation to you to start that discussion: /r/ideasforcc
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,penelopede,2,Thu Jul 16 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"You are doing this now that you guys have a lot of subscribers to back you up, you guys were not doing it before when it was still a growing sub and that why you've developed that reputation. It's only when you decide you want feedback in a controlled setting. If you are even trying to see this then there really is no point is there?"
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,2,Thu Jul 16 19:21:44 2015 UTC,"You make a lot of assumptions. If you aren't down, then stay there. If you're genuinely interested in being constructive— then make moves."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,penelopede,3,Thu Jul 16 19:48:57 2015 UTC,"What? I have no further intention of going back to CC, I never said I did. I made that point early on to tzitorres. You are the one that came on trying to 'fix' things. Listen, I appreciate you letting me know the changes you guys have made but for me it's unfixable at this point (it's just too large, the demographic is not a match for me, and the way it's modded is not my cup of tea). It's just not a sub I plan to visit.   Simply, the posts in themselves have become too narcissistic in nature for me and I don't feel like I can be myself there."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,EmptyOfIt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:53:45 2015 UTC,"Fair enough — Not to come off as heavy handed, I just still believe that all feedback would be helpful."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,HeroesGrave,-1,Fri Jul 17 01:57:36 2015 UTC,Meta discussion is useless when the mods are shadowbanning people for making a non-derisive joke about a subject they're obsessed with.
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,EmptyOfIt,4,Fri Jul 17 02:17:07 2015 UTC,Mods can't shadowban. Only admins have that power.
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,CBTJ,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:19:13 2015 UTC,Mods can set AutoModerator to automatically mark every one of a user's posts as spam. This has the exact same effect within an individual subreddit as a full shadowban does site-wide.
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:19:58 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily disagree with you about it turning to shit, but almost every post on their front page right now is a conversation."

Not an actual question conversation starting post. I haven't taken a look tonight but it's been this way for months including this morning when I posted it.
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,white_pontiac_77,2,Fri Jul 17 00:26:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, you're right. I took a better look and it's all just people announcing things about their life. Which is nice, but it doesn't start conversations. I completely agree with you"
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,WildTurkey81,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:12:14 2015 UTC,Exactly. It's very strange to me especially in a conversation sub but it seems a lot of people like that. I just had unsubscribe.
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,Swazzoo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:09:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought that too. But its still a good place to post a casual conversation, if you prompt one you'll still get a good post going. Its just that the most upvoted ones are like that."

trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,RYCBAR,8,Thu Jul 16 19:23:00 2015 UTC,Amen to that. It just starts feeling more and more like something in the line of /r/funny. Luckily there are still some people that understand the meaning of the sub. And boy are those posts hilarious.

I'm not cool with that type of moderation.  Edit: they're truly clueless, too."

If you're okay with them randomly banning people for whatever, that's your choice, and I'll respect that.  I maybe did put my opinion a bit too front and center in my OP. And yeah, I'm editing this apology in an hour after I posted this. I've been on and off of reddit tonight."

trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,1sagas1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:59:24 2015 UTC,Are you insinuating that 1000 words is a lot? That's only 20 minutes worth of writing.
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,gaardyn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:28:27 2015 UTC,Yeah but it's dedicating 20 minutes to getting banned from a subreddit. Kinda sad
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,5171984,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:10:03 2015 UTC,"Writing is a hobby. It's also a good way to relieve stress. Spending 20 minutes doing that is far more productive than, for example, playing video games."

trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,Baelorn,3,Thu Jul 16 13:58:53 2015 UTC,"It does, doesn't it? And yes,"
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,Lord_Michael_Bolton,2,Thu Jul 16 16:00:16 2015 UTC,/r/CasualConversation is essentially a hugbox. And the mods are very biased in what they consider casual. If they agree with your non-casual post they will let it be. If they don't agree it gets deleted(and maybe get banned).
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,gaardyn,3,Thu Jul 16 16:03:43 2015 UTC,"From my experience, if talk anything negative about that sub and what I expect are the teens that are now in control of that sub will come and downvote you."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,Lord_Michael_Bolton,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:12:53 2015 UTC,"I rarely use the word hugbox, but that's exactly what /r/CasualConversation is. They'll quickly spam filter someone who disagrees with their beliefs, even if it was done politely. It's a place where people can go to have their opinion validated with no fear of opposition, as long as that opinion is shared by the mods.   It's also a place where you can go whine about your failures because nobody is allowed to criticize you, and to brag about saying hi to a girl without vomiting.   I also like the fact that they have a ""megathread"" about how Reddit owes an apology to Ellen Pao. Incidentally, Ellen Pao is a mod of that sub. /r/CasualConversation puts /r/CircleJerk to shame."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,erwtre,3,Thu Jul 16 11:26:15 2015 UTC,"I'm sad how this subreddit turned, it was a cool place once."

trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,erwtre,2,Thu Jul 16 12:22:13 2015 UTC,Lets just say it's the complete opposite of what it is now.
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,Baelorn,2,Thu Jul 16 13:06:58 2015 UTC,Ah okay. What different subreddits did you move to?
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,Lord_Michael_Bolton,2,Thu Jul 16 16:10:43 2015 UTC,"I rarely use the word hugbox   So do I but that is exactly what /r/CasualConversation is and what it aims to be. They're very proud of that and there's nothing really wrong with that. The idea of a sub where everyone is relaxed and ""intense"" conversation is restricted isn't a bad one.  The issue is their selective enforcement and obvious biases. Also, banning someone for non-casual conversation in a meta thread is just absurd."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,tizorres,2,Thu Jul 16 16:16:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think it doesn't lead to anything authentic to restrict conversation like that, because you are essentially being stepfordy nice and many there are very passive aggressive."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,Baelorn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:27:59 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, we only ban people who are be hugely disrespectful towards any person or group. We give out more warning than anything and if we do ban someone it's normally only for a few days. Usually we let them know if they want to come back to send us a modmail."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,The_Homestarmy,3,Thu Jul 16 16:55:14 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue, from my perspective, is the clear bias of the mod team.   There was a post called out as non-casual, with ~100 upvotes, and a mod replied that they were letting it stand because it was ""well-informed"". That criteria seems to be applied selectively to stuff the mods agree with.  Browsing the sub now and the Ellen Pao resignation thread is a really good example of the mod bias. That whole post didn't belong in /r/CasualConversation and there was a lot of disrespectful comments being thrown around but the mods agreed with them so no one was banned and nothing was deleted."
trendingsubreddits,3dha7r,Gotitaila,-27,Thu Jul 16 18:03:45 2015 UTC,"/r/me_irl is trash. It's a repost ridden ""ironic self-loathing"" circlejerk with trash mods and incredibly stupid rules."

It's free to play, uses an incredibly fair business model and has a bunch of content.   The reason we're trending is ""Path of Exile: The Awakening"" has just gone live! It's a HUGE update to an already stellar game. You can download Path of Exile (PoE) straight from their website or from Steam.   /r/PathOfExile is the subreddit for everything Path of Exile; builds, help, discussion, fan-art and more. What makes the sub really special is the presence of Grinding Gear Games employees: the developers of the game.   I'm happy to answer any questions people have about the sub or the game!"

The devs are astonishingly active in the subreddit considering how busy they are. I've seen numerous times someone suggest a feature or fix and the lead developer /u/chris_wilson or another one of the devs respond and implement it without hesitation. You don't even have to play the game to appreciate the amount of work these guys put into it. Path of Exile is by far my favorite game of all time."

trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,ArchangelleSnek,8,Fri Jul 10 04:46:17 2015 UTC,"When you shit on someone's stoop as a joke, the results are still a pile of shit."
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,gaardyn,0,Thu Jul 9 22:03:45 2015 UTC,This is not a satirical or circlejerk subreddit. Nor did it start as one. This is a normal subreddit with tongue-in-cheek and satirical humor elements.
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,Swamp85,4,Thu Jul 9 22:15:00 2015 UTC,"For all the talk about how ""SJWs"" should have thicker skin and not take things so seriously, I dearly wish they'd take their own advice and not have a panic attack whenever a website publishes a review they don't like."
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,NanoGeek,6,Thu Jul 9 22:55:33 2015 UTC,This image sums it up pretty well.
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,EcoleBuissonniere,2,Thu Jul 9 20:27:07 2015 UTC,That's reddit in a nutshell right there
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,Soarel2,-3,Thu Jul 9 22:48:12 2015 UTC,"This is wrong. Hating something and being offended by something are not equivalent.    adjective: offended. resentful or annoyed, typically as a result of a perceived insult.   When person in the comic says he hates things, he is not necessarily offended by them.   I hate mushrooms on pizza, however I am not offended by them. I think the phrase ""I am offended by mushrooms"" would generally be perceived as non-sense or just silly in the very least."
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,Kappuccinno,2,Sat Jul 11 23:48:54 2015 UTC,Looks like someone is offended.
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,fedorabro-69,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:04:33 2015 UTC,"The hilarious bit about that is that reviews are by nature a subjective medium. Here's what I think about this game. Nowhere does it say that you gotta agree. Hell, Yahtzee's one of my favorites, and sometimes his reviews are so off the mark it feels like he's actively trying to be a contrarian."
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,iamaneviltaco,2,Fri Jul 10 06:20:21 2015 UTC,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,Ultra-Bad-Poker-Face,6,Thu Jul 9 21:11:35 2015 UTC,"Horseshoe theory:       The horseshoe theory in political science asserts that rather than the far left and the far right being at opposite and opposing ends of a linear political continuum, they in fact closely resemble one another, much like the ends of a horseshoe. The theory is attributed to French writer Jean-Pierre Faye.   In University of Reading academic Peter Barker's  book, GDR and Its History, Peter Thompson  of the University of Sheffield observes that the theory is ""increasingly orthodox,"" and describes the theory as seeing ""left and right-wing parties being closer to each other than the centre.""    Image i - Horseshoe theorists argue that the extreme left and the extreme right are a lot more similar than members of either group would admit.

trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,autowikibot,0,Fri Jul 10 00:45:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you've gotten it the wrong way around. We at KIA use horseshoe theory to describe SJW's.   We mock Polygon reviews because of the fact that it's supposed to be SJW's, that's not similar to being an SJW."
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,theone899,-8,Fri Jul 10 00:46:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the best part about KiA is how they claim to be all about ethics in journalism and yet take Breitbart seriously."
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,Gamiac,8,Fri Jul 10 07:42:40 2015 UTC,"Ethics (and logic) is judging a source by who they are instead of the veracity of what they've written in any specific article, of course."
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,cha0s,-3,Thu Jul 9 22:55:39 2015 UTC,"Right. And Breitbart's Milo Yiannopoulos is hardy a model of ethical journalism. But since he says things that GG likes, they shower him with adoration. Mind you, this is after he wrote this article filled with the kind of talk that sends KiA into a seething rage."
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,NanoGeek,-6,Fri Jul 10 01:04:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, because I was trying to imply that the problem with Breitbart was flaws in its character rather than its journalistic integrity. Kappa"
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,Gamiac,8,Fri Jul 10 01:44:37 2015 UTC,"No, you were implying that KiA supports Breitbart when the more honest thing to say would be that some people in KiA support some articles from Breitbart. Notice how that is closer to the truth, yet closer to weasel word terminology? I'll let you figure out the rest. :^)"
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,cha0s,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:11:41 2015 UTC,"No, you were implying that KiA supports Breitbart when the more honest thing to say would be that some people in KiA support some articles from Breitbart.   The KIA mods stickied a Breitbart article and it got 1000+ upvotes. Yes there is considerable support for it in GG."
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,sanguine_song,2,Fri Jul 10 01:24:00 2015 UTC,a Breitbart article  it   See it yet?
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,cha0s,-4,Fri Jul 10 05:56:58 2015 UTC,"Some users, yes, which upvote articles from Breitbart in greater numbers than those who downvote. In fact, the number of upvoters is great enough that they end up putting Breitbart articles on the front page of KiA. This is solid evidence that the majority of active KiA users support at least some Breitbart articles.  While I'm sure there are BB articles that don't make it to the front page, I'm willing to guess that most of the people browing KiA, like most other subreddits, don't browse further than the front page of KiA, and thus only see the articles that get upvoted, leading them to take BB seriously if they have no prior experience with them. This ends up having the end effect of most people who browse KiA supporting Breitbart by giving them more credibility than they deserve because they publish articles that coincide with their views, even if the majority of what they publish doesn't."
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,Gamiac,3,Fri Jul 10 05:58:10 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure all of those assumptions you just made are totally in your head. Have you ever considered that maybe it just, you know, is what it is? Some people upvote some articles because some articles are actually decent.  This whole ""gasp, horror, you're enabling people to take all of Breitbart seriously!"" is silly.  Not to mention ""supporting"" through the lens of your own bias means ""anything short of just plain trashing them based on name alone""."
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,cha0s,7,Fri Jul 10 01:47:56 2015 UTC,"Breitbart = shit, I don't support any of their articles except the one's exposing GameJournoPros."
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,Meowsticgoesnya,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:51:59 2015 UTC,I recall a breitbart article was stickied and had 1000+ upvotes when you were a mod there.

trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,Meowsticgoesnya,-3,Fri Jul 10 05:56:08 2015 UTC,"If you don't support any of their other articles, then what leads you to believe that the GameJournoPros articles are trustworthy?"
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,Gamiac,8,Fri Jul 10 07:30:08 2015 UTC,Because many of the GJP members admitted to it?
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,Meowsticgoesnya,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:42:31 2015 UTC,The same people who hate Breitbart take The Guardian seriously.
trendingsubreddits,3cnhfx,theone899,-1,Fri Jul 10 01:43:40 2015 UTC,Apparently they've recently decided that KiA is more than just gaming journalism. Still no word on how they view Breitbart.

trendingsubreddits,3cizcc,Kafke,44,Wed Jul 8 09:53:02 2015 UTC,"I'm in CS and love AI stuff and it made my brain hurt.  The gist of it is that it grabs a starting word, and then looks at what ""comes after"" that word. So use this conversation as an example. Let's start with ""it"":   it   If we look at the history of this conversation, we can see a few different options of what comes 'next'. We can have: just or made. So we choose one depending on a 'weight' (probability/how often it comes up in our source). Since they are both equally likely (appearing only once), we just choose one at random:   it just   Alright. Let's look at what comes after ""just"". We have: bots and Markov. Again 50/50.   it just Markov   Markov only has ""chain"" after it.   it just Markov Chain   And chan has ""bots"" and ""and"" after it.   it just Markov Chain bots   And so on:   it just Markov Chain bots. Each one is going on a different subreddit simulator   Now, instead of using this comment tree as a source, apply it to a whole subreddit.

For anyone interested, Markov chains can be trained to describe a motif or a common sequence in DNA and proteins (in much the same way subreddit sim is finding common sequences of words) and then used to find this motif in newly sequenced DNA. This can give us an insight into the biological role of a particular protein without ever having to extract, purify and test it."

While browsing /r/forwardsfromgrandma and /r/terriblefacebookmemes over the past couple of years I've found myself disliking Minions more and more. Finally, one day, while dabbing marijuana concentrate and browsing Reddit I thought ""We need an area to concentrate the Minions. So they're easier to burn in large quantities"" much like the marijuana concentrate. I came up with the idea of a subreddit dedicated to concentrating the Minion memes, sort of like a concentration ""zone"" or ""hangout"" or ""camp"" or whatever for Minions. So /r/MinionHate came to be.  All are welcome, you're encouraged to share a personal story of how you came to join us.

If FE is taking a darker tone, then it's only natural to deal with the horrible nature and after effects of war. One of my favorite series, Metal Gear Solid, deals with PTSD and child soldiers.

trendingsubreddits,3b63bi,ZeroKarasu,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:25:57 2015 UTC,"I agree. People get raped in real life, and removing scenes of rape in games like this isn't going to un-rape those people. I don't think it will prevent rape either. Censorship in my mind is carelessness that comes from the desire to avoid necessary discussions.

trendingsubreddits,3b63bi,codefreak8,2,Fri Jun 26 16:49:17 2015 UTC,"I don't want it put in for no good reason.

My legs were longer; I got there first. I opened the door for her and gallantly gestured for her to go in. It was an old contest of ours. Maybe my values are outdated, but I come from an old school of thought. I think that men ought to treat women like something other than just shorter, weaker men with breasts.

trendingsubreddits,3alaup,CipherClump,4,Mon Jun 22 00:20:25 2015 UTC,/r/cosmoandwanda is the cutest subreddit i have ever come across
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,mortalstampede,6,Sun Jun 21 16:56:24 2015 UTC,how is it that top posts only reach 5k upvotes every day? Are there only 5-8k voting each day?  Seems horribly low for some reason
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,Jabulon,10,Sun Jun 21 11:03:46 2015 UTC,Reddit fuzzes votes so the number you see is not the number of votes the post has.
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,doryx,2,Sun Jun 21 11:41:21 2015 UTC,how do you mean?
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,Jabulon,9,Sun Jun 21 12:14:31 2015 UTC,"I don't like to just pass you off to someone else, but /u/super6plx really does an amazing job explaining it all here."
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,SeeYouSpaceCorgi,3,Sun Jun 21 13:41:25 2015 UTC,"thanks, It doesnt explain what I was asking however.  Let me be more precise: How can the top votes every day, only have about 4-6k + votes?  Sometimes I get the impression reddit is HUGE, like on a global scale.  5k people isnt more than a medium stream on twitch however, and not a respectable share of the global audience.  fuzzing is why some comments/posts seem to be getting more +/- than it should (to stop bot and false +/-)"
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,Jabulon,6,Sun Jun 21 13:47:13 2015 UTC,I'm in the middle of a trip so excuse my brevity. The fuzzing is not linear. The first 100 votes have a greater impact than the next 1000 on the ranking algorithm. It's logarithmic with the way votes are added.
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,doryx,3,Sun Jun 21 14:00:58 2015 UTC,"it clearly say the end score will be the same no matter what tho.  I just find it weird that the most popular posts every day never get more than a few k. Do only about 10k people vote on them?  so if we assume about 50% of the readers tend to vote, thats still only 20k."
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,Jabulon,2,Sun Jun 21 15:16:38 2015 UTC,"No. After 3-4k, votes are being deleted by the thousands. I remember one admin saying in /r/TheoryOfReddit that frontpage posts get tens of thousands of votes in reality."
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,TunicSongForKaren,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:39:55 2015 UTC,why would they do that?
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,Jabulon,11,Sun Jun 21 15:47:43 2015 UTC,"To ensure that front page posts don't stay too long on the frontpage, as thousands of new people tend to vote on it when it hits /r/all. If they wouldn't, the algoritm would make posts stay on the frontpage for days on end."
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,TunicSongForKaren,5,Sun Jun 21 15:50:55 2015 UTC,"The reason it only shows around 4-6k upvotes is because reddit is constantly growing. If it didn't, then https://www.reddit.com/top will be always be recent posts instead of having some posts from years ago. The total upvote count is actually way way higher."
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,bobjrsenior,0,Sun Jun 21 17:23:20 2015 UTC,I'm in the middle of a trip   Thanks but you should really be looking for the clear white light.
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,omfgforealz,0,Mon Jun 22 01:45:49 2015 UTC,this is also the reason why some real shitposts end up on top of their subreddit or all. vote brigading may be bannable but it wins you reddit exposure quickly.
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,suicidalfitnessfreak,0,Mon Jun 22 06:31:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's because if they reported the real figure, everything would have to be pushed about 100 pixels to the right in order to fit that big number."
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,One_Giant_Nostril,0,Sun Jun 21 14:33:21 2015 UTC,You mean they fake the number? uh
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,Jabulon,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:17:22 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. The numbers shown give readers a good estimate of where the posts are in relation to each other (+6000 post was voted up 20% more than +5000 post), but the real numbers are hidden to keep numbers manageable and defeat bots that may track stats for nefarious reasons (like corporations that want to artificially vote up positive posts about their products.)"
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,multiusedrone,0,Sun Jun 21 19:32:39 2015 UTC,"Uh, to keep track of the popularity? Reddit wants to hide that, how come?  Or in other words, the upvote value then isnt really descriptive of how popular a post is. literally according to you.  I think this is really weird"

trendingsubreddits,3alaup,kojak2091,0,Sun Jun 21 18:18:13 2015 UTC,"dont you think its weird?  imagine if a post had 2m upvotes, wouldnt that feel different than an arbitrary number of 4k?"
trendingsubreddits,3alaup,Jabulon,7,Sun Jun 21 19:08:04 2015 UTC,"The admins filter out many subreddits, some because they are NSFW, some due to popularity (/r/gaming trending everyday would be boring.) and some due to censorship."

trendingsubreddits,3alaup,WolfofAnarchy,3,Sun Jun 21 12:57:02 2015 UTC,"/r/undelete is showing mod removals, not admin removals and has nothing to do with trending subs at all. They are always sfw because reddit doesn't want porn subs at the top of everyone page without warning and that is displayed at the top of the post. It's based on an abnormal growth of activity which is why default subs never get in and it tends to be medium or small subs.  They may be censoring out some subreddits from trending, but the other stuff said is irrelevant."

Five years ago or so, I bought a couple of packs for a friend for his birthday and he pulled a $25 out of one of them. I ended up going back to the store and bought $75 worth of packs. Then I got home, realized what I'd just done, and threw the cards in the fire unopened.

Although the meta does change quite often, at the beginning of the current season Druid was one of the weaker decks being played (was 5-6 before giving up), this week however, Combo Druid is fairly strong due to it countering the other top decks (climbed from rank 17 to rank 6 without losing over the past 3 days)."
trendingsubreddits,3abkzg,theboss1248,5,Thu Jun 18 21:38:40 2015 UTC,"Actually the RNG makes the skill cap higher because you have to account for every possible result and figure out rough probabilities in your head in order to make the best move or the move that is best most of the time.

These changes are still in open beta and will be for the next couple of months, but they're playable and fun already.  This heralds back to the days of SC:BW and WarCraft3, where the regular game was less popular than many of the user created modifications. DotA itself was one of those modifications, and now an entire genre with millions of daily players has been built around it. We're excited to see what the next generation of custom games will bring to the table.  Also of note is The International 5, a tournament that will take place in Seattle in early August and which currently has a $14 million prize pool (and growing), the largest of any competitive gaming tournament ever.

It took me a while to figure out how to buy items (I clicked on them and nothing happened because I forgot about courier), and how walking everywhere takes yes eek ears  I don't know the extent of the new custom game engine you are getting, but I'd hope someone could craft a better tutorial than ""go abuse axe because you have 1000 range over him"" or ""run around this irrelevant map"""
trendingsubreddits,3abkzg,Nesurame,2,Thu Jun 18 21:24:34 2015 UTC,"It depends a bit on why you think you won't enjoy Dota 2 (genre, camera style, art style etc), but the new update is supposed to have a far more improved tutorial for learning to play the game. Right now the biggest problem for trying to learn to play Dota 2 is that you really need to read a tutorial or watch a video in order to understand a lot of parts of the game, so hopefully the new tutorial system will make it a lot easier for new players to start playing the game.  If your problem is that you don't want to play with angry/flamey players the only advice I usually hear on the matter is that you should mute them immediately until you reach the point where most people are generally nice in games."
trendingsubreddits,3abkzg,adam2046,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:57:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever seen a screenshot video of Dota, it's more the style of game in general not Dota itself. And yeah, mostly the players, but so far I've yet to find a single online multiplayer game that I enjoy. I've never really played a MOBA before, though, so I figure I should at least give one a shot at some point."
trendingsubreddits,3abkzg,gaardyn,2,Thu Jun 18 21:27:39 2015 UTC,"Before I started playing Dota 2 I didn't really know how MOBAs worked, and my only real experience with the genre was that one time you got an achievement for playing one during a Steam sale.  Dota 2 has bot modes (offline mode where your team and the enemy team have bots and co-op with other players against bots) so if you want to try out the game without feeling like your bothering people, you can (I played a bunch of bot games before I actually went online).  I think the thing I actually enjoyed most when I started playing Dota 2 was the amount of voice acting the characters had in the game. All in all I think it's probably worth trying."
trendingsubreddits,3abkzg,adam2046,2,Thu Jun 18 21:31:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah just mute people as soon as you get in game, or see if you have any friends willing to play with you. There are also a few subreddits for learning dota and forming dota teams which I am sure are on the sidebar at /r/DotA2 which could probably be of help to you, if you want to communicate."
trendingsubreddits,3abkzg,stGrumbles,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:44:59 2015 UTC,"In my experience, new players have much more fun when they're playing relaxed games with friends, at least until they reach the point of ""competency"" where they can begin to enjoy the razor's edge competition without being baffled by new things every few minutes. So if you have a group who are interested in helping you learn, just jump in and play with them after going through the tutorials. If you don't, which isn't unlikely, spend some time playing co-op games against bots. They're zero pressure, and you can just mute anyone annoying instantly. If you find someone friendly who seems to know what they're doing and doesn't mind helping you out, shoot them a friend request and party up again. Regardless- ask a lot of questions.  The reality is that if you try to jump into real games right away you're not going to have much fun until you calibrate down to where you'll be with other novices- the first set of games will be lopsided and you'll be feeding and your team will probably be mad at you. But you can avoid that by just soaking up concepts and applying them to your co-op games. There's so much more to learn from nowadays, but there's still vast amounts of material to cover. I'd say that if you want to maximize learning efficiency, you probably want to split your time in thirds between guides/tutorials, watching professional play/streams, and actually playing yourself. And if you just don't find the first two parts interesting, which is true for some players, you won't learn very quickly, and that can make the game frustrating if you feel like you're fighting your way through it. Welcome to Dota, you suck has been the definitive guide since it came out, so I definitely recommend reading that after playing a bit to understand the basic flow of the game. It is aptly named.  I really feel like you simply have to enjoy uncovering the layers and layers of nuance in Dota2 for it to become the rewarding masterpiece to you that has kept us all enthralled for years. And that's hard, and intense learning of that sort is just flat out not something everyone finds fun. But the deeper into the rabbit hole you go, the deeper and more awesome the game becomes. Some players can have fun just occasionally dipping their feet in the water, but they are certainly the minority. I've really appreciated this line from a journalist during his self-documented introduction to the game Part 1 of this 3 part article here:   Dota 2 isn't an intimidating, unintuitive monsterpiece that's also a great game. It's partially great because it's preposterous. Dota 2 is a club that is its own doorman. Because it's such a huge, nuanced game, you have to invest in it as a player before you can enjoy it. But because all the players are invested in it, every match feels that much more huge. And because matches are made to feel epic, you need to invest in them even more.   Best of luck. :)"

trendingsubreddits,39k3dv,YOUGOTMOxY,-70,Fri Jun 12 13:00:35 2015 UTC,"Implying banning fph wasn't a personal grudge. Implying FPH harasses like srs, doxxes like srs, sends death threats like srs. Implying srs doesn't harrass everyone. Implying consumers can't complain about a product. Implying there aren't ideals apart from your tiny-minded concept of ""social justice"""
trendingsubreddits,39k3dv,YOUGOTMOxY,-36,Fri Jun 12 17:25:35 2015 UTC,Some people actually really care about this website and the free expression it stood for that it obviously doesn't stand for anymore.
trendingsubreddits,39k3dv,YOUGOTMOxY,-24,Fri Jun 12 17:26:01 2015 UTC,"As much as I see where you're coming from, the banning of jailbait was far different due to their reasoning. Jailbait was banned for breaking the law, doxxing and breaking privacy etc. (At least this is what the admins said, but I don't doubt they found the content abhorrent and that made the banning feel much easier for them)  But this time, the changes in the TOS mean that fph could be banned for ""violating a safe space.""   It's not our site's goal to be a completely free-speech platform. We want to be a safe platform and we want to be a platform that also protects privacy at the same time.   This time, the admins have been clear and upfront, they haven't used a ""brigading"" excuse, they've used in the past, they've made it very clear they're now banning subs for being offensive.   If reddit really was on a free speech curtailing binge, then those subs would also be gone. But they aren't. Because some people just won't accept the fact that FPH was a launching pad for harassment on reddit. And witch hunting has always been disallowed.   This is just not true at all. FPH did everything it could to prevent witch-hunting, brigading and harrasment. (I mean, you couldn't even link to reddit at all in fph) but the admins have said that reddit is no longer ""a free speech platform"" so this point is pretty redundant."
trendingsubreddits,39k3dv,SodiumChlorideBot,-6,Fri Jun 12 17:26:59 2015 UTC,I'm not aware of exactly what happened but I've been told they placed an image of one of the imgur admins in the sidebar which is not harassment by definition.  But if it was more than that and you have evidence I'll reconsider my statement.

We're banning behavior, not ideas. While we don't agree with the content of the subreddit, we don't have reports of it harassing individuals.   I'm still yet to see evidence of this fph harrassing individuals."
trendingsubreddits,39k3dv,AiseKrom,12,Fri Jun 12 17:39:24 2015 UTC,"Why do you feel you are owed an explanation from the mods?  They said fph was breaking the rules and banned it.  End of story, nothing of value was lost."

trendingsubreddits,399rx1,eloquentboot,4,Thu Jun 11 02:06:11 2015 UTC,"Kia? Tia? voat?  lol, I think it's more about this being the internet and as long as it's not illegal, then why censor it.  It's not like fatpeoplehate was a default sub.  I never knew it existed until it got banned."
trendingsubreddits,399rx1,Str_,10,Wed Jun 10 22:00:13 2015 UTC,"The big problem with it, was it was always on top of /r/all. A lot of people don't frequent all, but subs that exist for the purpose of hate that get popular enough are a safe bet to get banned by the admins. It made the site look much worse, and they are to a degree protecting the brand from further backlash than it has already gotten in the last five years."

Reddit couldn't actually exist forever by making money from gold, the site doesn't profit. But I have a hard time believing they would ever force an ad to view a link. But I get it, internet conversations always have to blow up to the most massive extremes."
trendingsubreddits,399rx1,eloquentboot,-5,Thu Jun 11 01:39:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly, just like all the comments saying that one subreddit was DESTROYING reddit. I mean come on. Simply ridiculous."
trendingsubreddits,399rx1,Distorted_Torsion,-1,Thu Jun 11 01:43:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you're accusing me of doing that, but I didn't make that argument. I simply said that the site had the right to ban the sub if it felt like it could damage it's reputation, and the complaints from people have been unwarranted. The sub was stupid, hateful and dangerous, but it didn't affect how I use reddit, I mostly browse animal pictures, dank memes, and the sports subs."
trendingsubreddits,399rx1,eloquentboot,-5,Thu Jun 11 01:50:29 2015 UTC,"Well the Admins plan certainly worked, /r/all is totally not in ruins right now."
trendingsubreddits,399rx1,_Madison_,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:54:55 2015 UTC,"Gay, brown, immigrant, cis male checking in here. Just because you focus only on the extremes doesn't make the arguments they're based in any less worrying. FPH is an extreme voice against obesity, which is a real threat to society. SJWs are extreme voices for civil rights, et al, which again, is an important conversation to have.  I've spent plenty of time in activism circles in the past and if you learn anything, you learn this: There's no need to immediately shut down someone's argument and belittle them and their message down to ""stfu white cis asshole."" It only works against you."
trendingsubreddits,399rx1,ToddimusPrime,7,Wed Jun 10 22:57:25 2015 UTC,FPH had nothing to do with actually being productive towards solving obesity problems and everything to do with anonymous assholes being assholes. Stop trying to spin this situation as anything other than people facing consequences for being assholes. Trying to make this about free spech or anything else is ridiculous.
trendingsubreddits,399rx1,Claidheamh_Righ,2,Wed Jun 10 22:25:44 2015 UTC,"Fat-shaming actually increases obesity and mental health issues. If you were actually interested in decreasing obesity, you would support health education and not make fun of pictures of people on the internet.   Article   These effects were also specific to weight discrimination; other forms of discrimination (e.g., sex, race) were unrelated to risk of obesity at follow-up. The present research demonstrates that, in addition to poorer mental health outcomes, weight discrimination has implications for obesity. Rather than motivating individuals to lose weight, weight discrimination increases risk for obesity."

trendingsubreddits,399rx1,fphthrowawaynumber,9,Wed Jun 10 22:19:15 2015 UTC,"Contrary to your belief, the internet is not half SJW's and half ""shitlords"". There's plenty of people that realize that both groups are assholes who are out of touch with reality."

trendingsubreddits,399rx1,TempusThales,4,Wed Jun 10 22:22:55 2015 UTC,"Well I was just called an SJW, but I certainly ridiculed point by point what someone else said. http://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/cs2bitm  I think you people reject every piece of evidence that go against your stances, and it turns into hates of all groups that you don't belong to. That can be Blacks, gays, trans, Asians, or overweight people. You guys just want to be treated as a minority, and get special privileges that frankly there is no reason for you to get. You act like children, and are incapable of arguing with evidence, only with anger and emotion."
trendingsubreddits,399rx1,eloquentboot,-9,Thu Jun 11 03:54:55 2015 UTC,Did you just call me racist? How dare you. I am like super triggered now. I may dislike obesity but I sure as hell am not racist.
trendingsubreddits,399rx1,fphthrowawaynumber,0,Wed Jun 10 22:25:53 2015 UTC,"No, I didn't call you racist. But the groups that you belong with certainly are racist. And the subreddit that you are defending certainly had a much larger problem with women than it did with men. So I suppose to a degree I do think you are sexist. And I certainly won't make you read into the fact that I think it's a safe bet that you're a little bit dumb also.  All of that is neither here nor there. People who complain about SJW's on reddit are the same people who praise Sweden as the greatest place on the planet, as if they have no idea about their social policies. I'm going to group you with them because of your phrases."
trendingsubreddits,399rx1,eloquentboot,-2,Wed Jun 10 22:28:21 2015 UTC,"Yep, you found the fat SJW, good eye. How about you ridicule my points, rather than resort to namecalling. The way that the reaction has been to the announcement today has been an embarrassment  to the site. Reddit's job is not to ensure that you have free speech. It's job is to ensure quality content and safety to it's userbase. Every sub that I mentioned is a cancer to this website, and to society in general."
trendingsubreddits,399rx1,eloquentboot,-3,Wed Jun 10 22:33:32 2015 UTC,"Quality content like the reposts from /r/funny? Safety? SAFETY? We have subreddits full of corpses and dead kids, what do you think about those?"

The problem there is that they only allow photos, and a lot of people submit scans of historic documents and there's nowhere to direct them. So, we're staying in the same theme/network."
trendingsubreddits,399rx1,ZadocPaet,8,Thu Jun 11 05:34:00 2015 UTC,"Ask the top mod. Not really a fan of the -porn suffix myself, but I guess it is to conform to the SFWP network naming standards."
trendingsubreddits,399rx1,agentlame,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:31:07 2015 UTC,"Well, on reddit you can often try to guess image name subs by adding the ""porn extension.""   Also, you want to be in the SFW Porn Network eventually.   It's one thing about reddit culture that does get negative comments, but it prolifically widespread. If you want to join the larger network, and be easily found and recognized as image sub, it helps."

trendingsubreddits,39fkx0,gaardyn,11,Thu Jun 11 21:36:25 2015 UTC,"The timing is all over the place for ""normal"" days. There have even been days where no trending subs were posted at all or they were posted more than once in a single day.  There's also the matter of the cut-off time for trending. It doesn't run from midnight to midnight. The cutoff seems to be early enough that it's entirely possible that the entire kerfuffle started after the cut-off point and some of the fallout could appear on the list tomorrow.  There's also the matter of nothing ever having been said to indicate that these are the ""most"" trending subs. People seem to think that but they have no reason too, especially considering the times that there have been multiple trends posted in the same day with the lists being entirely different. Even if /r/coontown is the most trending sub in the history of trending subs, that's no guarantee that it will make the list even without manually manipulation.  Which isn't to say that the list hasn't been manipulated. There's absolutely no doubt that the list is handled manually, considering one of the mods admitted to accidentally pushing the list through twice the first time /r/circlejerk trended, causing it to be knocked off the trending list. (They caused themselves to trend again the next day, however, without incident.)  This is all to say that it's possible that the list was manually edited to avoid any of the controversial subs. It's also entirely possible that the list is completely legit. The important thing is that it's not really a topic worthy of discussion, thus my 271 word comment about the matter."

trendingsubreddits,39fkx0,7mad,-1,Thu Jun 11 18:28:02 2015 UTC,"I want to use reddit like normal too, but for me (and I think many of the people mad about this) -- what just happened means that we can't use reddit ""like normal.""  This is an active protest, and it's being supported by a massive amount of the reddit userbase.  I was never a member of the subs that got banned and do not condone their behavior at all.  But, as much as I am mad at what those individuals did, I am even MORE mad that there can suddenly be this community policy coming from the top down as an executive fiat.   It's not the CONTENT of what was banned.  Obviously the content and behavior was pretty atrocious.  It's the idea that we as a community don't know how to police ourselves.  And it's the idea that it's not OUR community now, we're not even in charge.  Reddit always felt like we were in charge, like the users are in charge of this thing.  People are testing that and demanding that back, I think that's more of what this is about."
trendingsubreddits,39fkx0,skarharghlh,2,Thu Jun 11 17:12:34 2015 UTC,"It's the idea that we as a community don't know how to police ourselves.   Sorry, but in the case of FPH, they were right. Reddit's a collection of communities, not one community, and one of the rules is that the communities shouldn't attack each other. Another states that you can't attack people in real life. FPH encouraged both. The first rule protects the individual communities, the second protects Reddit itself.  And I disagree that it's supported by a massive amount. FPH was always one of the most active subreddits for it's size, it seems to attract the type of people who'd be happy to spend hours causing a shitstorm, but it's was only 150,000 users. /r/funny has something like 7 million."
trendingsubreddits,39fkx0,ThePorkychopz,-1,Thu Jun 11 17:46:26 2015 UTC,"Okay, and I get that for sure.  but there are lots of potential solutions.  They might have posted about the problem and fielded calls for a solution.  One alternative that could have been done would be something like all those in game mods in games like second life and Warcraft. People would for sure volunteer to be those helper / warnings person and if the system were set up okay enough it might work out.    Or, that might be a terrible idea that gets voted down immediately.  Either way we don't know, because they decided for us.    A last thing about this whole thing that really anger me as well is the general tone of the admins and even some of those angry with the protest.  The tone taken by the admins is always that the user base is mindnumbingly stupid or all 14 years old or all obsessed with name calling and cat pictures and that.  That isn't the case at all.  I'm 28 years old and all of my friends are on reddit as well.  , I'm sure you're a lot older than 14 and probably most of the people on this subreddit are as well.   I've always sort of had the impression that some of the admins sort of feel that way about us redditors , and in particular Ellen -- there is this aspect to her posts that is always ""aww, look what reddit did..."" .  if this were a company we would be sending out massive mailings in the same type of way.    This is how shareholder takeovers of companies sometimes work , and if reddit is ostensibly democratic than this sort of organizing and mobilizing is within the rules I think.  edit forgot your second question.  Well, I can only speak for myself, but I had never heard of any of those sites before the announcement was made, and was definitely not a member of anything related to it."
trendingsubreddits,39fkx0,SpamFilterHatesMe,0,Thu Jun 11 18:02:11 2015 UTC,"I agree, the admins are handling this really badly. Hopefully once everything quiets down and the most extreme users move off the site there can be more of a dialog and things can be figured out."

trendingsubreddits,39fkx0,minimim,-2,Thu Jun 11 14:16:55 2015 UTC,"What I'm thinking right now about this debate is that things shouldn't continue like they were, because harassing. But closing the subreddit was not the right answer, it was motivated by the new policy of making reddit a safe-space for advertisers. I don't like FPH one bit, but banning their subreddit won't get rid of their ideas. What I think should have happened is that the bad moderators should have been banned, but this would open a big can of worms for the admins, because so many subreddits don't like their moderators. My take on this: the admins need to take action and get involved more directly into subreddit governance, avoiding the coarser tools that are leaving their fallout on the front page right now."
trendingsubreddits,39fkx0,Baconlover90,2,Thu Jun 11 16:04:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The people who were on FPH had a right to free speech, just as their moderators and admins had a right to tell them to stop. Banning the subreddit and its replacements may have stopped any potential harassment, but it did so by removing the free speech of those who were not part of the harassment."

Unsurprisingly they aren't going to support stuff thats basically calling them Nazis for banning a shit tier subreddit.  Its not like they people can't just... Go on r/all? Its kind of a cesspit right now."
trendingsubreddits,39fkx0,makemisteaks,-6,Fri Jun 12 00:41:40 2015 UTC,"You know, it's not that we don't agree that fatpeoplehate was a crappy sub. I even had it on my RES filter list to be honest. But if there was any proof that this was at all not about harassment and totally about having a sub making fun of fat people, it's the fact that the admins have basically banned every single sub that has appeared since then, sometimes after only 30 minutes since their inception.    I'm also a bit worried that these decisions are made without the community being able to review the accusations. Saying that they were a source of harassment could mean almost anything. This is standard reddit policy BTW, sub bans and shadowbans are handed entirely at their discretion with no chance of appeal."
trendingsubreddits,39fkx0,ErasmoGnome,23,Fri Jun 12 07:20:17 2015 UTC,"the fact that the admins have basically banned every single sub that has appeared since then, sometimes after only 30 minutes since their inception.   Ban evasion is also a bannable offense."
trendingsubreddits,39fkx0,noobit,-22,Fri Jun 12 07:24:03 2015 UTC,"The sub was banned because, supposedly, the community was harassing people. Other subs were created, how could they be made to stand the same accusation if they had just been created?    The admins have clearly defined what constitutes harassment. Here's admin Jessica's (aka 5days) official definition (source):     Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them. We used the behavior in the subreddits to determine the banning.     How exactly can a sub that's 30 minutes old be accused of ""systematic and/or continued actions""? The fact is that it can't, which proves my point."
trendingsubreddits,39fkx0,Sikletrynet,23,Thu Jun 11 12:15:24 2015 UTC,"That's just silly. A rose is still a rose under any other name. If FPH was banned, and they all went to FatPersonHate, then the exact same community is there, and it still warrants a ban. Nothing has happened except a name change. Sure, the sub itself technically hasn't harrassed anyone, but that's about as meaningful as moving all prisoners to a different prison and saying ""you can't KNOW that it's filled with criminals"". Of course it is, and saying it isn't is just anally sticking to the letter of the law. The subs that keep sprouting up are ban evasion, and even if you don't agree with the original ban the subsequent ones are consistent."
trendingsubreddits,39fkx0,TotesMessenger,-19,Thu Jun 11 13:01:00 2015 UTC,"But the exact same community is not there. For all they know, the troublemakers could have gone to a private sub, or a different sub. They don't know, and they didn't even gave them the benefit of the doubt that they could have a sub free from so-called harassment and doxxing.    Effectively banning an opinion instead of an action, the very thing they proclaim to be against."
trendingsubreddits,39fkx0,sterffff,15,Thu Jun 11 13:33:32 2015 UTC,"Really? You think all the troublemakers went to a private sub? I think any realistic person knows it is the same people, and it's simply silly to say otherwise.  Banning isn't about benefit of the doubt. It's saying that a community broke the rules to such an extent that they deserve to be gone.   That same community created the same subreddit again. Do you disagree with that statement? I don't see how you can. It was expressly stated to have the same goals as FPH, and to think that magically an entirely new section of people wanted the EXACT same sub that was just banned is stupid. You honestly think it was different people? You can say benefit of the doubt all you want, but I find that absurd enough to not even qualify.  What do you think the point of a subreddit ban is? It's to stop a community from congregating to perpetrate certain actions. If the same community creates the same subreddit, then the exact same logic can be reapplied for a ban. You absolutely cannot disagree with the same subreddit part, so instead you disagree with the same community part, which baffles me. If you honestly think it's a new group of people, then fine, I'll never convince you. But it seems self-evident that it's the same people to me."
trendingsubreddits,39fkx0,xkcd_transcriber,-7,Thu Jun 11 15:15:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they did or not. The point I was trying to make is that neither do you, I don't see how that can be considered self-evident. We're both making assumptions, I don't know why your assumption is right and mine is ""absurd enough to not even qualify""... unless of course you have some proof of what you're saying? I'm gonna guess that you don't. Me neither BTW, which is why I prefer to not assume anything.    Regardless, a ban was brought down on the community not because they posted pictures of fat people but because the mods of FPH were unable to contain or did nothing to stop the so-called harassment, I don't see how you can assume out of the bad that the same holds true to all the other subsequent subs, especially since the original mod team has, AFAIK, all been shadowbanned."
trendingsubreddits,39fkx0,Kinmuan,8,Thu Jun 11 15:21:22 2015 UTC,".... right. OK, look, I guess I am never going to convince you.  Just to recap though: DIRECTLY after FPH was banned, ""some group of people"" began to create subs whose EXPLICIT purpose was to emulate FPH.  One one hand, it could be the people from FPH. On the other hand... Actually, I'm not even sure what the other option could be. The new subs didn't even try to hide that they were incarnations of the same community. This isn't some secret mission where they hide that they were actually the old FPH community. They were very open about it. You seem to be under the impression that those creating the new subs are somehow going ""We can neither confirm or deny that we are the same community as before"". That's blatantly not the case.  If you think it is likely enough that a magical group of new people wandered in JUST as FPH was banned and started creating new subreddits that were EXPLICITLY created to be EXACTLY the same as the old one that that likelihood falls under some standard of reasonable doubt, fine. Like I said, I'll never convince you. But really?"
trendingsubreddits,39fkx0,Lifeisgood71,13,Thu Jun 11 15:31:27 2015 UTC,"Just because the sub is 30 minutes old doesn't mean the community is 30 minutes old. Reddit has IP and account data, and can see when a former member of one community tries to create another.    It's hard to think the people rabidly recreating FPH subreddits never accessed FPH from their accounts or IP's. I made a private sub with a FPH-like name and as of yet it's still up, so I'm guessing they're either using IP or account info, or the actual actions taken after subreddit creation.

The theory is that while the event will happen, it will for another reason, in another place."

trendingsubreddits,394v9j,thisbaseball1,12,Tue Jun 9 19:36:50 2015 UTC,"You're all right in a certain way.   The show deviates significantly from the book, and has started to do so since season 2. Calling the show ""fanfic"" is harsh, but it's not exactly true to the source material. Stannis' character is arguably the biggest deviation  Martin did tell the directors to do this controversial thing.. This doesn't necessarily mean he'll write things out this way in his next book. There's plenty of evidence to suggest otherwise (mainly that in the books Shireen is at the wall and Stannis is marching on Winterfell).   I don't know why people can't accept that book Stannis is not and will never be TV Stannis. It's like the difference between Book Faramir and Movie Faramir in the Lord of the Rings.   You might as well call TV Stannis by a different name, like Janice. Janice isn't Stannis. Stannis isn't Janice."
trendingsubreddits,394v9j,SawRub,5,Tue Jun 9 19:47:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly, he told them to burn her, not that Stannis did it, since in the books Stannis leaves his family at the Wall, and leaves strict instructions to place his daughter on the Iron Throne even after he dies, and then does not permit burning in his camp even thought they are dying because of the weather. Very different circumstances.  Meanwhile, Melisandre and Shireen are together at the Wall, and Melisandre's chapter reveals she has some other plan now, and she will likely burn Shireen for that."

Likewise, people still hate Dreadfort and love Stannis even to this day.  The only thing the list tells you is that Stannis did something that made 759 people angry. That's not even a lot of people.   I think I could say very safely that in every episode of Game of Thrones, EVERY main character does SOMETHING that would make 759 people say ""Fuck [that guy].""  It could also be a subreddit for people sexually attracted to Stannis, for all you know.   So yeah, there are no spoilers just by the list existing.

trendingsubreddits,3906gn,gaardyn,3,Mon Jun 8 21:01:58 2015 UTC,"I do this every once in a while out of my own curiosity. Here's March through May's stats: 67 subs were 30 days or under when they hit trending. Of these, 20 are still active (mostly related to popular real-world events, such as sports, TV shows, and games), and 7 are moderate.  I considered ""Active"" being multiple new posts with comments per day. ""Moderate"" is averaging ~1 post per day. Low is fewer than 7 posts per week, very low is only a post or three per week or less. In this table, I count a sub as ""dead"" if it receives one post or less for about a month. I don't count ""is this sub dead"" / ""this sub is dead"" posts as counting towards activity, as they don't actually deal with any content.  Yes, it's subjective. As well, if a sub has a low volume of posts but decent commenting or voting, I bump it up (/r/sweetjustice is an example of this).

trendingsubreddits,3906gn,Trill-I-Am,7,Mon Jun 8 16:27:25 2015 UTC,/r/tennis is awesome. The mods create new backgrounds several times a month and post match and/or results threads nearly every day.
trendingsubreddits,3906gn,jkalderash,5,Mon Jun 8 17:36:33 2015 UTC,How many trending subreddits does Destiny need?

trendingsubreddits,3906gn,gaardyn,7,Mon Jun 8 22:00:15 2015 UTC,/r/tennis is one of the best sub. I love this sub.
trendingsubreddits,3906gn,fantasise,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:18:53 2015 UTC,"Thoughts on Roland Garros? It's been really strange not seeing the Top 4 really taking any of the major opens, it's almost like we're in a transitioning state where no single rivalry is dominating tennis. Which makes me sad because I started following tennis towards the end of the Federer-Rafa duel."
trendingsubreddits,3906gn,igotmoveslikejagger,3,Mon Jun 8 14:49:34 2015 UTC,"It's been really strange not seeing the Top 4 really taking any of the major opens,   But that's IMO a good thing for the ATP - the Big 4 aren't getting any younger; Wawrinka is around their age but it's great to see him finally fulfil his potential. Plus there are so many good youngsters now in the top 100 (Kyrgios, Kokkinakis, Coric, Zverev) who might form rivalries of their own in the next few years.   Having new faces waiting in the wings is always a good thing for any sport."

trendingsubreddits,3906gn,instinctblues,5,Mon Jun 8 23:05:48 2015 UTC,I think the best comparison is Lost. It has a mystery element to it but if you are solely focused on the mystery and don't give a shit about the characters you will just end up frustrated. But if you just treat the mystery as a cherry on your character interaction based TV show sundae you will really enjoy it. The first episode is pretty slow but once you get to know the characters it is pretty good show. Not up the standards of say Daredevil or Orange is the New Black but still worth watching if you have the time. The basic idea of the show is what if eight people became a hive mind and could share thoughts feelings and skills. So it is basically about these people going through their lives with occasional visits from people who are very different from them and how they all become friends like a Korean Banking Exec spending time talking to a poor african bus driver or a DJ talking to a Chicago cop.

trendingsubreddits,38n10i,TheSimonToUrGarfunkl,5,Fri Jun 5 15:09:47 2015 UTC,I've been subscribed to /r/fallout4 for the past few months.  Those memes arrived with the current hype train.
trendingsubreddits,38n10i,deadfraggle,0,Fri Jun 5 15:53:37 2015 UTC,Along with 3/4ths of the content. Both subs were ghost towns before a few days ago.
trendingsubreddits,38n10i,iamaneviltaco,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:20:13 2015 UTC,"From a modding perspective, I'm green with envy. Getting people to post content is no easy task."
trendingsubreddits,38n10i,deadfraggle,8,Fri Jun 5 23:31:40 2015 UTC,"/r/gaming largely consists of pictures, memes and other fast and easily consumable submissions, while /r/games strictly forbids these which is why there are more articles and such.  /r/gaming:   Submissions must be directly gaming-related. ""Related"" means that posts must contain gaming-related content in the link's content, or in the post's body in the case of a self-post, not just a ""forced"" connection via the title or a caption added to the content.   /r/games:   The goal of /r/Games is to provide a place for informative and interesting gaming content and discussions. Submissions should be for the purpose of informing or initiating a discussion, not just with the goal of entertaining viewers.   As you can see /r/gaming's rules are very vague. Most types of content are allowed. /r/games on the other hand has far stricter rules."

trendingsubreddits,38n10i,iamaneviltaco,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:22:22 2015 UTC,I feel like the level of fallout would be massive. I don't advise it.
trendingsubreddits,38n10i,Kiiari,7,Fri Jun 5 22:48:48 2015 UTC,Hopefully it's not like /r/GrandTheftAutoV and /r/GTAV where it's basically stubborn mods in a dick measuring contest that don't want to give their tiny amount of internet power.
trendingsubreddits,38n10i,Smurf_Poo,-1,Fri Jun 5 09:22:22 2015 UTC,As a subscriber of both of those subreddits:  What the hell are you on about?
trendingsubreddits,38n10i,TheNathanNS,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:36:59 2015 UTC,"Instead of closing the smaller subreddit and redirecting their traffic to the bigger one, the smaller one feels like being on their own special little snow flake and segregating traffic for no good reason."
trendingsubreddits,38n10i,Smurf_Poo,0,Fri Jun 5 18:30:12 2015 UTC,So why even have a subreddit specifically for GTAV? Why couldn't they just stick to the original GTA subreddit?
trendingsubreddits,38n10i,gaardyn,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:54:59 2015 UTC,Because GTA V is different from all of GTA? Some people only have/want to talk about GTA V and don't care about any of the others.
trendingsubreddits,38n10i,corbygray528,0,Fri Jun 5 21:22:09 2015 UTC,And just because people want to talk about something doesn't mean they want to talk about it in the exact same way or in the exact same environment. Thus there exist multiple subreddits for the same topic.
trendingsubreddits,38n10i,gaardyn,-1,Fri Jun 5 21:40:29 2015 UTC,"Looks like it to me, to be honest. There is a ""fallout network"" and /r/fallout4 doesn't belong for one reason or another."
trendingsubreddits,38n10i,schm0,5,Fri Jun 5 14:17:47 2015 UTC,Because the people who created /r/Fallout4 aren't part of the network. The point of a network is to be able to promise the same quality across all subs in the network. You can't do that if you don't have control of a particular sub.
trendingsubreddits,38n10i,gaardyn,-1,Fri Jun 5 14:30:02 2015 UTC,You also can't do that if you don't ask because of some petty Internet related disagreement. :)
trendingsubreddits,38n10i,schm0,2,Fri Jun 5 14:50:05 2015 UTC,"/r/fallout4 has more followers but is not part of the ""fallout network"" which I can only assume means there was a ""falling out"" at some point, to use a pun."
trendingsubreddits,38n10i,schm0,0,Fri Jun 5 14:16:18 2015 UTC,"Nah, they discussed this in a thread. Moral of the story is the mod behind fallout4 started their sub without knowing fo4 existed. They've even stated repeatedly on both sides that a merger wouldn't be off the table, and that there's no animosity.   That said? I feel like having a rules-light fallout board isn't a terrible thing. I see no issue with memes and the like.  Oh, as for the more members? Fallout4 trended first. Simple as that."
trendingsubreddits,38n10i,iamaneviltaco,2,Fri Jun 5 23:24:51 2015 UTC,"Well, that's a relief. The GTAV subreddit mess was a childish fiasco."
trendingsubreddits,38n10i,schm0,2,Sat Jun 6 00:22:07 2015 UTC,"If you look around, you will tend to see a LOT of followings have two types of subs.

trendingsubreddits,38n10i,iamaneviltaco,4,Sun Jun 7 09:55:57 2015 UTC,/r/fo4 is the official Fallout 4 sub (listed that way on /r/fallout) while /r/fallout4 seems to be some other random Fallout 4 sub that gained more subs and views. /r/fo4 is run by the actual people who run /r/Fallout and the like so maybe /r/fallout4 becoming the official fallout 4 sub won't be a bad thing. Its never good for one group of mods to have control over everything.

Or, something is announced/anticipated and multiple people create a sub for it. Many who stumble onto one, may not know the others exist.

trendingsubreddits,38hnpm,Donttellnoone,0,Thu Jun 4 20:21:27 2015 UTC,It is because BBT is seen as making fun of nerds while Community is seen as nerds having fun.
trendingsubreddits,38hnpm,gaardyn,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:28:30 2015 UTC,What's wrong with making fun of nerds?
trendingsubreddits,38hnpm,Donttellnoone,0,Fri Jun 5 00:52:23 2015 UTC,"Well for the first part making fun of anyone is frowned upon and particularly singling out a group is discrimination which is also frowned upon. Making fun of others can be funny and everyone does it, but BBT is based on making fun of certain people(nerds) while Community pokes fun at society and pop culture(most of the time).  Second everyone on Reddit is (arguably) a nerd. Being a nerd about something just means you like it a lot and if you subscribe to a subreddit, you like that subject enough to be a nerd about it. Although there may be many people on Reddit who do not call themselves nerds, there is a large portion that does and so they speak out about how they dislike BBT which starts a pack mentality making everyone say the dislike BBT.  I personally like both, but I do think Community is better because it seems smarter in terms of how they setup a joke and I enjoy the comedy more. If you have not seen it I would definitely recommend it."

So Dirty Bomb, fast paced like TF2. Very team oriented like Enemy Territory. Unique movement/jump system. Geared towards competitive play. Free.  Try it out.

trendingsubreddits,38730i,gaardyn,-9,Tue Jun 2 14:28:16 2015 UTC,Shia LeBeouf told me to do it.
trendingsubreddits,38730i,Iskandar11,-7,Tue Jun 2 15:01:20 2015 UTC,The problem is the entire point of reddit is sharing and the only way to find other sub reddits is sharing. There is no other good way to get out the word of your sub other than just randomly hoping it takes off or promoting it on other threads.
trendingsubreddits,38730i,geekyamazon,5,Tue Jun 2 16:33:40 2015 UTC,"You mean aside from /r/newreddits which has ~5x as many subscribers as this subreddit and is specifically designed for the purpose of promoting your subreddit?  Or the fact that you can get a free advertising for your subreddit sitewide via /r/subredditads?  There's also /r/wowthissubexists, which forbids spamming your own subreddit but has over 60,000 subscribers and can easily drive traffic to worthwhile subs.  There are plenty of legitimate ways to drive traffic to your sub without spamming. The problem is it requires a bit of thought and intelligence. The reason subs don't take off isn't because there's no way to let people know about them, it's because the people running the sub don't have the mindset required to run a successful sub."
trendingsubreddits,38730i,gaardyn,-2,Tue Jun 2 16:41:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip on /r/subredditads
trendingsubreddits,38730i,Iskandar11,-5,Tue Jun 2 17:27:47 2015 UTC,Yea I already posted in /r/newreddits and got a lot of upvotes but only like 5 subscribers.
trendingsubreddits,38730i,Iskandar11,3,Tue Jun 2 17:52:57 2015 UTC,Then perhaps the problem isn't with an inability to get the word out about your sub and is actually a problem with the sub's ability to attract subscribers.
trendingsubreddits,38730i,gaardyn,-4,Tue Jun 2 18:14:24 2015 UTC,"I've gotten 28 subs on the first day. It is a lot harder than you think to create a new subreddit and get subscribers, I bet you couldn't do better."
trendingsubreddits,38730i,Iskandar11,2,Tue Jun 2 18:41:36 2015 UTC,I certainly couldn't do better if I was trying to promote a stupid sub in the first place.
trendingsubreddits,38730i,gaardyn,-4,Tue Jun 2 18:49:36 2015 UTC,Real mature man... Honestly though how would you go about it without spamming and get a lot of subscribers?
trendingsubreddits,38730i,Iskandar11,2,Tue Jun 2 19:00:47 2015 UTC,Exactly like I described above. I'm in the process of getting one sub that already has a couple of thousand subscribers ready for an advertising campaign and then I'm going to move on to a brand new sub that currently has 0 content or subscribers.
trendingsubreddits,38730i,gaardyn,5,Tue Jun 2 19:03:30 2015 UTC,"thats not true at all   Please do not advertise irrelevant subreddits in the comments. Find other, more relevant places to get the word out about your subreddit. /r/newreddits is a good catch-all option.   did you read the sidebar? theres is a place specifically made for this"
trendingsubreddits,38730i,legonro,-6,Tue Jun 2 16:49:03 2015 UTC,What's not true?  I didn't say anything about what is on the sidebar or the rules of this sub.  Newreddits does not drive the average redditor.  Sorry it is a tiny free speech zone.  It is NOT how the average redditor finds new subs.
trendingsubreddits,38730i,geekyamazon,2,Tue Jun 2 17:03:34 2015 UTC,you said the only way to promote your sub was randomly promoting it in threads like this
trendingsubreddits,38730i,legonro,-6,Tue Jun 2 17:04:55 2015 UTC,If you think posting your new sub once in those subbreddits actually make the majority of your reddit aware of your sub to even those looking for it you are mistaken.  Reddit does not have a real structure in place for finding subreddits.  Al of the subs listed in this sub got here by someone posting them in other threads
trendingsubreddits,38730i,geekyamazon,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:08:16 2015 UTC,"Other threads where promoting the subreddit is relevant due to the conversation at hand? Sure.

trendingsubreddits,37kfmn,LeSpatula,4,Thu May 28 17:42:24 2015 UTC,"Probably the best argument for this is a preemptive strike against more violence, thus creating a smaller net violence for both or just for you. For instance in WWII the firebombing of japan caused a lot of civilian deaths, and would probably have been ruled a war crime if the US lost, but by doing this we where able to take out their dispersed manufacturing infrastructure and save American lives. Though in this instance the active killing of civilians was not the main goal so you could argue that it wasn't murder, but rather a form of manslaughter.   To bring this more down on a personal level. One form of murder could be assisted suicide. Say a parent is suffering from cancer and you know 100% that they will die a slow and painful death. You could just shoot them in the head and be done with it.   Or you could know that a said person is an active killer has killed and will kill again, by shooting them you are saving human lives. You shoot them in the head. Boom, justified murder not in self defense.   However, is it ever OK to kill a good person, who isn't going to die, and you are specifically targeting that person. What if your a doctor and you have 5 patients who are about to die. A perfectly healthy guy walks in and you notice that if you killed this man and harvested his organs you could save all 5 people. Aren't you at least slightly obligated to kill this person for the greater good?"

trendingsubreddits,37kfmn,gaardyn,5,Thu May 28 13:22:47 2015 UTC,Something tells me their algorithm for picking trending subreddits is more sophisticated than highest % growth wins...
trendingsubreddits,37kfmn,Odrevan,2,Thu May 28 14:47:52 2015 UTC,"There are multiple things that can cause a subreddit to trend. Subscriber growth is definitely one of them, as evidenced by the large number of brand new subs that make the trending list. It isn't the only deciding factor, however, as evidenced by the fact that /r/AdviceAnimals once trended despite losing subscribers from the previous day. (There's also the time that /r/circlejerk mass unsubscribed and resubscribed for the sole purpose of making the trending list.)  It's certainly not a matter of ""highest % of growth wins"" either because nothign has ever been said to indicate that the subreddits displayed are the most trending. In fact, the description states that it's simply a ""small selection"" of the trending subreddits. The fact that there have been at least two instances where they accidentally re-ran the trending script, resulting in a completely different set of trending subreddits, suggests that the selection is somewhat random. (There have also been days where there were no trending subreddits displayed at all, with the previous day's list being visible for ~48 hours.)  This is mostly speculation, of course, because they have explicitly stated that they'll never reveal the complete criteria for trending. This allows them to prevent spammers from causing their own subreddits to trend while also allowing them to insert paying subreddits into the list without anyone being able to prove that that subreddit didn't legitimately trend."

It wasn't created on Reddit nor is it some weird Reddit thing that's only popular here.  Case in point:  Here's the Wikipedia article on food porn that talks about the phrase being coined back in 1984.  Here's someone's Pinterest board named stationary porn.  Here's a Twitter account called The Quotes Porn named after the Facebook page of the same name. 45,000+ followers.  Here's a Wired article from a couple of years ago referring to Google's Site Reliability Czar as a purveyor of car porn due to his enthusiasm about posting about fancy automobiles.  IO9 has a space porn tag for photos from space.  Here's a tumblog named book porn which showcases photos of books.

If someone expect others to do the job for them, or tell them why it's not their fault, then Apotheoun is exactly the opposite of what they want.

Hey, let's make the bad guy a popular rich kid because everyone hates popular rich kids. Oh, but he's also troubled and sells drugs (because he needs the money...?) and brings a gun to school (because school shooters are always the most popular kids in school?). Oh, and he's a rapist too for good measure.  That applies to a bunch of other characters, too. It never felt like the game was presenting me with real, believable characters; it went out of its way to tell me how to feel about every one of them.  Maybe it gets better after ep1, but my experience with it felt too manufactured to be worth playing more."

trendingsubreddits,36z0f4,SexyJazzCat,1 point,Sun May 24 06:46:45 2015 UTC,I gave 2 reasons in the comment.  (1) school shooters are almost universally unpopular  (2) its unlikely the richest kid in school would be selling drugs
trendingsubreddits,36z0f4,HowieCameUnglued,0,Tue May 26 00:21:15 2015 UTC,"???? Im lost. How do those things make the writing bad? I mean even then he isn't a school shooter, and him selling drugs is consistent with his rebellious and ""I own the world"" persona."
trendingsubreddits,36z0f4,SexyJazzCat,0,Tue May 26 03:49:06 2015 UTC,"He brings a gun to school. He's popular, well-liked, and rich (so has been told from birth that he's hot shit). It seems extremely unlikely to me that he'd be so insecure (or in fact ""rebellious"" at all). They mashed together two stereotypes (""rich pre-frat boy"" and ""insecure and volatile/crazy""). He doesn't strike me as someone who could exist in the real world.  More generally, he just feels like a cartoon villain or character from CSI. He's so over the top bad. That's what I mean by not liking to be told how to feel about a character.  This would be fine in most other games, but LiS is a game that gets by on its writing, and I really dislike the way it was written. Just my opinion."
trendingsubreddits,36z0f4,HowieCameUnglued,1 point,Tue May 26 15:00:02 2015 UTC,"He's very clearly a psychopath who thinks he can do whatever he wants. I don't understand why you think it's unlikely for a person to have both traits.The game isn't really telling you how to feel about any of the characters. It's simply portraying each one in their own way and you seem to be mistaking this as them telling us how to feel about them. What we feel about them is completely up to us.  With that said, I just don't see it the way you do."

It's not like once you 34 you suddenly turn into a tank, hobgoblins will still 2-3 shot you.  Some confusion might arise since, the damage dealt and taken by enemies is tied to their levels.

If the other two people in your fireteam were blaming deaths on you for not having a G-Horn, then those guys are idiots who were probably the reason you guys wiped.

After they were done shooting him in the bubble we just scrambled and ran around in circles for the sake of avoiding enemies, it never worked out for various reasons.  I agree though, people who demand that you have the damn thing are really annoying. It's also pretty absurd that the new toughest fight in the game can be solved instantly by using it too."

Although, if they kept trying the 30-sec strat and it wasn't working because you didn't have a G-Horn, then you all probably should've tried a different strat.  I agree that it's stupid that the final fight can be completed so quickly. They shouldn't have given Skolas solar burn. The amount of damage he deals with the burn should have been dealt without the burn, to keep the fight hard, and it should have been a no-burn fight.

I agree with you about the subs but you're not looking at both sides to this. Reddit not being a platform for free speech was news to all of its users a few days ago. And there are no caveats to free speech no matter how horrible some people are.  Now the celeb nudes are an entirely different matter that I view very differently than you. While I don't think its nice or proper they were posted online and I feel for those affected, them being posted was no different than the gutter press which gets paid by established media to follow celebrities.   Everyone seems to forget that the nudes were first released for bitcoin, the guy who did it wasn't doing it for free. He was out to make money, just like the rest of the gutter press.   And trying to shame people for looking at them is pathetic, a lot of celebrities' images are built around aspiration but suddenly people should feel ashamed for wanting to see these people naked? I'm not condoning the orchestrator, but you can't hold the viewers with the same contempt as the person who put them up.  As for SJWs, I agree, it has become a label used to stop someone expressing their views. I've never seen a real SJW outside of the internet, not by reddit's definition anyway, and I attend a pretty big university.   I will say this against subs like /r/BestOfOutrageCulture and the SRS crowd. Simply holding what you deem correct views is not an adequate substitute for actually doing good.   Some views some people hold are terrible, but creating an echo chamber collecting them and wanking each other off about how right you are, then moving swiftly on to the next thing to be outraged about isn't accomplishing anything at all.

Free speech only applies to the government imprisoning you for what you say.  Reddit can ban whoever they want for whatever they say.    Freedom of speech doesnt mean freedom from consequence, as long as its not the government.   While I don't think its nice or proper they were posted online and I feel for those affected, them being posted was no different than the gutter press which gets paid by established media to follow celebrities.   Yeah and both are pretty disgusting.  That doesnt justify it.   suddenly people should feel ashamed for wanting to see these people naked?   You should feel ashamed that youre doing it without their consent.   but creating an echo chamber collecting them and wanking each other off about how right you are, then moving swiftly on to the next thing to be outraged about isn't accomplishing anything at all.

Both of the two subreddits I mentioned don't limit themselves to just one demographic while hold my ___ outside of beer is meant for laughing at one subset of people, which is kind of uncomfortable imo. Like having a holdmyyarmulke subreddit to laugh at Jewish people doing stupid things.   I'm not offended because I'm not part of those groups, but it does leave a bad taste in the mouth."

I can't really remember the last time a woman hit the front page of HMB, but that doesn't make someone trying to walk down a gentle icy slope in heels any less hilarious, it just might not be a ""beer"" moment and more of a ""This is why Heels are torture devices"" moment."

trendingsubreddits,36gxt8,Hygienic_Sucrose,9,Tue May 19 13:44:21 2015 UTC,"It's handy because the younger generation is so reliant on technology that some of them can't do basic math in their head.

(Personally, I'd go with ""You might end up on a deserted island with no signal and then everyone will find out you're stupid and they'll vote to eat you first."")   It's useful in this thread because school is getting out and kids have time for dumb novelty accounts."

trendingsubreddits,36cvp3,Lawsoffire,2,Tue May 19 07:21:44 2015 UTC,"Ampullae of Lorenzini:       The ampullae of Lorenzini are special sensing organs called electroreceptors, forming a network of jelly-filled pores. They are mostly discussed as being found in cartilaginous fish (sharks, rays, and chimaeras); however, they are also reported to be found in Chondrostei such as reedfish  and sturgeon.  Lungfish have also been reported to have them.  Teleosts have re-evolved a different type of electroreceptors.  They were first described by Stefano Lorenzini in 1678.  These sensory organs help fish to sense electric fields in the water. Each ampulla consists of a jelly-filled canal opening to the surface by a pore in the skin and ending blindly in a cluster of small pockets full of special jelly. The ampullae are mostly clustered into groups inside the body, each cluster having ampullae connecting with different parts of the skin, but preserving a left-right symmetry. The canal lengths vary from animal to animal, but the distribution of the pores is generally specific to each species. The ampullae pores are plainly visible as dark spots in the skin. They provide fish with an additional sense capable of detecting electromagnetic fields as well as temperature gradients.

Or our top post which you posted yesterday, again only after reuploading it on imgur. This doesn't just mean that people can't find my sub, but that the people who make these videos, that deserve the credit, don't get it because there's now nothing to link back to them.   Do you see the pattern here? I was going to mention the posts that your subscribers post after they are popular on my sub, but that's not a problem because at least they have the respect to keep the image url the same so that people can see where else it's been posted and join in with the discussion.   There's nothing wrong with having two similar subreddits, we just need to find our niches. But don't accuse me of something you do on a regular basis.  EDIT: I think you missed my point. It's not stealing to take images that have been on the front page and post them on a relevant subreddit.

You also say he stole it from your sub and uploaded it to his channel, yet the channel in the link posted on /r/simulated uploaded that video in january of 2014...certainly not in the last month.

I do think it is important to mention that just jumping into the ocean without the basic survival skills you need (IE: don't try and directly fight a rip tide, you will +only die tired and don't try and face check 12 ft wave) is dangerous. The ocean is a lot like crossing a road you need to know what is dangerous and what isn't and how to deal with the dangerous stuff. Just like trying to cross a freeway is stupid but you can cross a residential street easily. The ocean is no more dangerous than crossing the street but you treat it like an amusement park and it can kill you."

A lot of people have a problem with it, because the AI follows the racing line more closely. I find that if you race like you're supposed to (not swerving over the track, sticking to the race line, checking your sides) you will not notice it too much. If you turn up the AI to 100 it provides a serious challenge, while in GT6 you can usually pass every single car from the back in 1 lap. With that said, I feel that it has the following advantages; Better graphics, more tracks (100+), interesting campaign mode, muuuuuch more customisation in terms of livery and camera settings, and great attention to detail. On the downside I feel that the physics are not necessarily better than GT6, but it's hard to compare because the general feel of the two games is just vastly different. I've played it for a couple of hours now and I can say that I'm satisfied with the game. That said, I would've wished that Logitech wheels were compatible, because now I have to buy a brand new wheel just for this gane..."

Live music and sound of article  Silent film:       Showings of silent films almost always featured live music, starting with the guitarist, at the first public projection of movies by the Lumière Brothers on December 28, 1895 in Paris. This was furthered in 1896 by the first motion picture exhibition in the United States at Koster and Bial's Music Hall in New York City. At this event, Edison set the precedent that all exhibitions should be accompanied by an orchestra.   From the beginning, music was recognized as essential, contributing to the atmosphere and giving the audience vital emotional cues. (Musicians sometimes played on film sets during shooting for similar reasons.) However, depending on the size of the exhibition site, musical accompaniment could drastically change in size.   Small town and neighborhood movie theatres usually had a pianist. Beginning in the mid-1910s, large city theaters tended to have organists or ensembles of musicians. Massive theater organs were designed to fill a gap between a simple piano soloist and a larger orchestra. Theatre organs had a wide range of special effects; theatrical organs such as the famous ""Mighty Wurlitzer"" could simulate some orchestral sounds along with a number of percussion effects such as bass drums and cymbals and sound effects ranging from galloping horses to rolling rain.

trendingsubreddits,3519o1,insanityfarm,11,Wed May 6 13:41:00 2015 UTC,Could be an influx of PC players. Many of them waited to play GTA V until the PC release so they could just be subscribing to the sub now pushing it to trending status.

The discovery of a whole new, unreachable level (without cheats) is interesting because what difference might there be between level 5 and level six?  The change they seem to have made between IV and V was eliminating the first star, where cops in IV pursued you without lethal force. Now, 1 star will get you shot at. There's no way to be wanted without lethal force. So if IV's 6* = V's 5* then what does V's 6* = ?"

There have been a lot of changes in the latest season, and I am guessing that there has been a jump in activity because we are past the leak period.   Also, there's usually always a spike in activity around the show season—but that may have been delayed by the leak stuff.

trendingsubreddits,34stzy,Meowingtons-PhD,13,Mon May 4 07:21:29 2015 UTC,"Seriously. I thought that subreddit was dead, then it goes and rises up again."
trendingsubreddits,34stzy,kerosion,10,Mon May 4 07:24:52 2015 UTC,The weird thing is that there's hardly been any growth
trendingsubreddits,34stzy,Meowingtons-PhD,10,Mon May 4 07:27:31 2015 UTC,"Looking over the others for the day, in terms of absolute numbers:   Technology - Growth ~310 Terrariums - Growth ~301 Witcher -  Growth ~179 ImaginaryGiants - Growth ~272 StarWars - Growth ~395   Maybe Technology came off a black-list and can now be picked up by things like the trending bot?"
trendingsubreddits,34stzy,kerosion,4,Mon May 4 07:34:09 2015 UTC,"Could be. Though last I heard, trending subs were based on growth percentage, not absolute numbers. That's .006% growth."
trendingsubreddits,34stzy,Meowingtons-PhD,6,Mon May 4 07:35:35 2015 UTC,"I promise to you that's not how it works. /r/SlyGifs has had around 100% growth twice (once around 3.5k-7k subs, and once from around 8k-16k subs), and the only time it trended was the day it was made.   There's some kind of randomness involved I think."
trendingsubreddits,34stzy,IranianGenius,2,Mon May 4 14:30:40 2015 UTC,"Well, the description at the top does say ""a small selection of trending subs"". A lot of people seem to think it's the ""Top Five Trending Subs"" and that they're listed in order (on more than one occasion I've seen a sub declare they're the #1 trending sub on Reddit because they were first on the list) but there's never been anything stated to that effect.  If anything, the fact that on a few occasions, trending was run more than once on the same day and while some subs made the list both times, there were others that were unique does indicate a level of randomness. (Once such time was the day that /r/CircleJerk mass unsubscribed and resubscribed, getting themselves onto the trending list. An admin owned up to making a mistake that caused the trending list to regenerate, forcing /r/CircleJerk off of the second list. They successfully trended the next day.)  And subscriber growth definitely isn't the sole thing that causes a sub to trend. Back when it lost default status, /r/AdviceAnimals trended despite shrinking in subscriber count.  I'm pretty sure trending is determined by a combination of subscriber growth, activity, random mistakes1 , bribery, and alcohol/drug use.    1 This may or may not include cats walking across keyboards."
trendingsubreddits,34stzy,gaardyn,0,Mon May 4 16:26:14 2015 UTC,I agree with what you said. What I meant by my comment was simply that growth percentage is not the only factor.
trendingsubreddits,34stzy,IranianGenius,0,Mon May 4 16:28:55 2015 UTC,Yep. I was just elaborating on your comment with enough gambling to disguise that I was using it as an excuse to call the admins alcoholics.

trendingsubreddits,34lopi,Swamp85,5,Sun May 3 01:44:30 2015 UTC,Colonel Sanders was actually considered to be George Wallace's running mate in 1968.  It's hard to imagine whether that would have helped or hurt Wallace's campaign...
trendingsubreddits,34lopi,monsterbeatle,2,Sun May 3 03:18:24 2015 UTC,"Section 2. Vice-presidential selection of article  George Wallace presidential campaign, 1968:       Former Georgia governor Marvin Griffin was a temporary running mate in order to get the Wallace candidacy on the ballot in several states. The Wallace campaign considered former Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson, retired Air Force General Curtis LeMay, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Colonel Sanders [dubious – discuss] as possible running mates. Benson and LeMay expressed interest, and Hoover did not even respond. In June, the campaign looked into several members of Congress, all of whom were unwilling to attach themselves to the Wallace ticket. Wallace's aides came to favor Happy Chandler, the former baseball commissioner and governor of Kentucky. It was hoped that Chandler could help put Wallace over the top in Tennessee, South Carolina, and Florida, where he was narrowly behind Nixon, and solidify support in Arkansas, Georgia, and North Carolina, where Wallace was leading. Wallace was cautious: Chandler had supported the hiring of Jackie Robinson by the Brooklyn Dodgers, and was now more of a mainstream liberal Democratic politician. Wallace was persuaded by early September; as one of Wallace's aides put it, ""We have all the nuts in the country, we could get some decent people– you working one side of the street and he working the other side."" When the ""done deal"" was leaked to the press, Wallace's supporters objected; Wallace's Kentucky campaign chair resigned, and influential donor Nelson Bunker Hunt demanded that Chandler be dropped from the ticket. Wallace retracted the invitation. Hunt's first choice for the second slot was Eisenhower Cabinet member Ezra Taft Benson. Benson was barred by several Mormon leaders from joining a Wallace ticket; Benson's membership in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles would cause an image problem for the church if he joined the Wallace ticket      Interesting: Tom Turnipseed | United States presidential election, 1968 | George Wallace | United States presidential election, 2008   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

I think it was a mistake for this subreddit to be chosen for trending so soon after it's reconception, but I'll take the publicity for the sake of the early subscribers.  In the last 5 days, since I have requested to restart the subreddit, the number of subscribers has gone from 30 (mostly bots) to over 1,000.  The content hasn't been added entirely, nor have I completed the CSS.  The only thing I can ask is patience as I grow the subreddit that I am sure many of the subscribers want it to become.  I ask for all suggestions and ask for the help of the new subscribers to submit content that you want to see in this subreddit, and let your peers vote to decide if it fits within everyone's vision.  There is a lot of work to do here, since this could explode in my face and everyone elses due to the people who don't want this subreddit to happen (as seen from the amount of spam I had to remove), but others and I think it's worth the attempt."

I think redditors are usually talking about the usual 77% statistic, which IS crap when presented to imply it's all discrimination; it's described as misleading by a variety of sources (including some you linked), including FiveThirtyEight and PBS Newshour. And FWIW, Maddox did cite some reputable sources too, although he obviously was biased, e.g., that WaPo article he linked didn't separate men and women for that 7.4% salary negotiation difference, and it noted that another study found male employers penalized women for trying to negotiate their salaries more than they penalized their male counterparts, which could explain the differences in negotiation."

trendingsubreddits,349agp,W_T_Jones,-14,Thu Apr 30 00:13:01 2015 UTC,It is due to sexism. What else would be the reason?
trendingsubreddits,349agp,W_T_Jones,17,Thu Apr 30 02:05:23 2015 UTC,"A very simplified answer would be: gender roles. Women are more likely to take jobs in fields that have lower pay on average. If you compare a man and a women in the same job role with the same qualifications, the gap is much smaller than this 30% number people tend to throw around.  Now, yes, there are fewer women in high-paying industries because of how society influences women against going into traditionally masculine fields, which can be seen as patriarchal, which is inherently sexist. But that doesn't mean that all gender roles are sexist. All societies with gender have gender roles. The problem is when people are discriminated against for going against those roles. What we need to do is continue to positively influence young women and try to interest them in learning about traditionally masculine fields. We need to make it OK for people to break gender stereotypes and follow their dreams!"
trendingsubreddits,349agp,hrbuchanan,0,Wed Apr 29 17:03:27 2015 UTC,"Now, yes, there are fewer women in high-paying industries because of how society influences women against going into traditionally masculine fields, which can be seen as patriarchal, which is inherently sexist.   This is generally why this difference in career trends (and by extension pay trends) is considered sexist by many people - on a societal and structural level rather than individual.  Oftentimes debates are derailed because people are using the term ""sexism"" in two different ways - one using it to describe explicit, individual acts of blatant sexism, the other using it to describe long-term trends exhibited/indirectly encouraged by both society and government.  It's the same issue that shows up during racial debates, when people use the term ""racism"" in two different ways - one describing explicit, blatant acts of individual racism, the other describing structural racism that has existed for hundreds of years, and has actively been fueled by both societal and government decisions.  And man, it sucks when an otherwise great discussion gets derailed over that misunderstanding.  The breaking of gender roles is something that is actively discriminated against by the majority of society - and though it primarily tends to disadvantage women, it definitely affects men negatively too.  It's good to see the changes that are happening nowadays, though - here's to hoping that level of progress can make the world a better place for everyone in the coming decades."

trendingsubreddits,344nt5,Alphaetus_Prime,11,Tue Apr 28 17:03:33 2015 UTC,"It was in Early Access mode, it's something that's supposed to fund the game and make it known to the public, but is often used as a cash grab, and the turd will remain a turd. Although KSP did it fantastically. They actually went out of early access into a full release."
trendingsubreddits,344nt5,nameless88,11,Tue Apr 28 17:11:22 2015 UTC,KSP predates early access as a formal concept.

trendingsubreddits,344nt5,stoopidemu,14,Tue Apr 28 16:33:45 2015 UTC,"I like how you give them all a little sentence describing them except for /r/grime.  Here is how wikipedia describes it for those curious.   Grime is a genre of English music that emerged in London, England. It was developed in the early 2000s, primarily as a development of UK garage, drum and bass, dancehall and hip hop. Pioneers of this stylized music include Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, Lethal Bizzle, Kano, Ghetts, Jammer and Skepta. Prominent grime crews include Newham Generals, Boy Better Know and Roll Deep."

Grime takes from many genres including UKGarage, dancehall, hiphop & also parts of Dubstep."

trendingsubreddits,33wi5r,gaardyn,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:37:00 2015 UTC,"I'm going to take a recent example from Blizzard Entertainment and World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor.  The loot system in the game was, at the start, different.  When you killed a boss, it would rarely drop loot that was tailored to you specifically.  This was way less often than the old system where a good piece of gear always dropped that might not have been for you.  There was a minor outcry from the vocal minority that wanted the latter system.  They changed it back, and not too long after a much larger minority raised their complaints.  The system was reinstated, and even improved as now the final boss of an instance always dropped a good piece of gear for you."

trendingsubreddits,33wi5r,gaardyn,2,Sun Apr 26 19:35:42 2015 UTC,"The issue itself is not that modders are now able to charge for their work, to me the biggest issues about it are the fact that Bethesda and Valve get 75% of any payment, and that the rest of the industry will see this as a way to get free money off other people's work (which it is)."

trendingsubreddits,33wi5r,AhrmiintheUnseen,0,Mon Apr 27 02:51:52 2015 UTC,You are correct. What the problem is that some mods might depend on paid mods to function. Now that game you bought years ago for a fixed price no longer costs the same to mod it like you used to.

I think the amount of content that, for example, Half-Life Opposing Force provided on top of vanilla Half-Life is a good baseline for paid DLC. Ditto with Counterstrike and Team Fortress Classic. The former adds on more levels, items, and even a new multiplayer mode + maps to the core Half-Life experience. The latter two comprise entirely different multiplayer games that use Half-Life's engine.  Monetizing skins is okay too. But monetizing SkyUI and other resources that OTHER modders use? Someone screwed up and screwed up hard."

trendingsubreddits,33ssu9,Smurf_Poo,0,Sun Apr 26 03:58:30 2015 UTC,I don't disagree with anything you're saying. I think the paid mod thing is shitty. I just don't think immediately setting up a place to pirate mods helps the entitlement in the gaming community.
trendingsubreddits,33ssu9,Swamp85,9,Sun Apr 26 04:08:21 2015 UTC,It is NOT trending because of positive attention towards this unmitigated disaster. Its trending because its a natural place amongst others to discuss it and everyone or so is against it. Also a few modders made threads there where they denounced the idea to great applause.

Finally, if you'd like to learn how to donate to this conflict to help the millions of displaced Syrian refugees affected, below is a list of charities rated ""B+"" (72%-74% of funds raised are used for the purposes stated) who provide support to the Syrian Humanitarian Relief:  CARE  CRS  Church World Service  Doctors without Borders  International Medical Corps.

Rather, I was implying you to be analogous to the man in the comic. What defines the relevant groups of people is irrelevant, in this case. You are both insulting large and diverse groups of people, where the groups are defined by a single characteristic. In both cases, that characteristic is not definitively sufficient grounds upon which to judge those in the group.

He literally invented bitcoin to pay for model trains from overseas because credit cards wouldn't do overseas stuff back then. I doubt he's a billionaire because he doesn't want to deal with that hastle.
trendingsubreddits,32bbmh,ScenesfromaCat,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:21:01 2015 UTC,Being a billionaire is way less of a hassle than being poor. You pay other people to manage your money and live off the returns/interest. It's not like he has to be the CEO of Bitcoin Inc. or something.

trendingsubreddits,327ldv,gaardyn,3,Sat Apr 11 08:12:45 2015 UTC,"Songs are recorded in individual parts for each instrument and vocals. When a song is mastered, the individual parts are mixed together. When you remaster a song, you mix those parts together again, generally in a more enjoyable way.  One famous example of poor mastering is Metallica's And Justice For All.... The bass is turned down so low that you can barely hear it. (Recently, the sound engineer came public with the fact that Lars Ulrich forced him to do that.) If they were to remaster that album, they would hopefully turn the bass up so that it can be heard."
trendingsubreddits,327ldv,ILoveDicksquad,3,Sat Apr 11 20:17:27 2015 UTC,"you're talking about mixing (the individual mixer channels of a song being meshed all together properly into the final track).  mastering is the final process where the track as a whole is made louder, fixed a little bit, that sort of thing (that's why it's called mastering: it's on the master mixer track. speaking of metallica, death magnetic is a really good example of poor mastering: the songs are so loud that the waveforms literally look like brick walls, there is no dynamic range lmao"

You can check out my multi-reddit which has all (and I'm trying to keep it up to date) the subs dedicated to the button. The button doesn't actually do anything, it's just a timer counting down to zero, and every time someone pushes the button it resets the button back to 60 seconds. The subs surrounding the button are all just for shits and giggles, they don't actually mean anything. Every time you push the button, whatever the time was at gives you a color. For instance, if I pushed at 60 seconds, I'd have a purple flair next to my name on the /r/thebutton sub. People kind of created cults around the different colors, but again they don't mean anything.   The colors for the flairs go as followed    Gray didn't push the button   Purple: Between 52 seconds and 60 seconds  Blue Between 42 seconds and 51 seconds Green: Between 32 seconds and 41 seconds Yellow: Between 22 seconds and 31 seconds Orange: Between 12 seconds and 21 seconds Red: Between 0 seconds and 11 seconds   (Got that list from here )   You can also check out these topics for more info:   https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/31mdkf/the_huge_list_of_everything_button/  https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/313ucm/what_is_the_subreddit_rthebutton_and_why_are_all/   Hope this really helps."

It's why most trending subreddits are new or smaller subs that have received a large amount of attention (through linking in a default, usually). Any increase for them is going to be much larger proportional to their size - it's very hard to get larger (100k+) subreddits to trend here."

The annoying part being that users are highly likely to get a bunch of subreddits that they simply find uninteresting.

The mods at /r/asoiaf feel that they have built a very good sub and don't want to lose their prestige, so they have decided to include show conversation too. In fact anyone who posts anything negative about the show seems to have their content flagged and deleted pretty quickly.

trendingsubreddits,31afon,srcarter,-1,Sat Apr 4 01:39:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe people would contribute to a discussion with you if you'd curb the hostility.  I agree that TPP was the biggest and most recent case (and thus the one that sticks most in my mind and makes finding examples difficult), but ultimately the spawning of 'religions' was just the joke ""man we select this helix fossil so often it's like we're consulting it for advice"" taken far beyond the logical extreme, just like the internet (and Reddit in particular) does with any viral joke that springs out of nowhere. The texts and sermons and all of the stuff that spawned out of the Helix fossil were a meme pitting one group against the other and those sorts of ""x vs y"" memes have existed since the dawn of the internet.   'PC Master Race vs Filthy Console Peasants' is one that comes to mind where we see two sides either deified or otherwise greatly embellished and exaggerated: replace 'PC' and 'Console' with 'Helix' and 'Dome' and there you go, but it goes further back than that, too- Boxxy is the first example that came to mind, and if we take away the religious overtones of a bunch of Redditors beating a joke to death I could list stuff like NSync vs The Backstreet Boys as examples of the same phenomenon. Ultimately, you're right in that it's likely there aren't many other instances of 'religions spawning in minutes', but those weren't so much religions as extensions of one big fat ""Helix is god lol"" joke, which is no different from any other short-lived fad on the internet.  TL;DR: The spawning of religions thing was an extended ""us vs them"" meme, which have been around since the internet started. Everything else is just a joke being beaten to death. It was specifically unique, but generally unoriginal."

At the same time it's a new thing (religious jokes/new religions) and more of the same (us vs them, taking arbitrary sides, beating a joke into the ground).  I disagree that all there is to arguing is proving your point, and it should be evident in the way I'm approaching the discussion- namely, that I'm calling it a discussion, not an argument.

As their rank increased, the users standing in real life began to improve in relation. On its second day of testing, those who achieved the highest status of Five MeowMeowBeenz became important figures and highly influential on the lower ranked users.

trendingsubreddits,31afon,Sorrento110,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:49:10 2015 UTC,It's quite amazing that a button that has no clear purpose has actually brought people together in different ways to make these communities. I got involved over at /r/59s as a CSS mod and I'm loving it.
trendingsubreddits,31afon,ScenesfromaCat,-18,Fri Apr 3 18:01:13 2015 UTC,Why not make communities around things that matter. Spend your time building houses for aborted disenfranchised Haitians or something.
trendingsubreddits,31afon,Sorrento110,8,Fri Apr 3 12:57:22 2015 UTC,"All of Reddit's April fools jokes that revolve around communities get large. Just look at the one two years ago, with orangered vs periwinkle. It's only just ended fighting for territories, and it still isn't over. The inventiveness of the community revolving around that joke was phenomenal. This may not be as phenomenal, as it feels as if it's riding a TPP theme, but it is still quite amazing that everyone has organized so flawlessly over something that has seemingly no meaning.   In addition, building houses in Haiti would be wonderful. I'm sure if we could raise enough funds to send all of us there with the correct building supplies, permits, passports, travel costs, food costs, and room and board covered we would have a wonderful turnout. Because these people involved with the button, like most on reddit, genuinely care about others. So tons of these button pressers or non pressers would sign up to go build charity houses in Haiti, together, if funds allowed.   However that is not the case. We are all people too. We have debt, commitments, families, jobs, school. At the end of the day, the whole button ordeal is just a way to entertain ourselves, to get a fun break from the monotony of reality.  And if it draws in large amounts of redditors enjoying the feeling of community, of trivial conflict, of inventiveness and creativeness, so what?

The middle of the floor has a pedestal on it with a button at the top. An experimental press of the button resets the time to sixty seconds. Also in the room are a wooden post and a goat. The door behind you slams shut and locks.   This puzzle room is somewhat well-known among DnD players for being a dirty trick on the part of the DM. The post and the goat are red herrings. The solution to the puzzle is to let the timer run down to zero, at which time a hidden door opens, allowing the party to progress. It is useful for instilling panic in the players, because of the ominous nature of the clock.  This puzzle room is also the main reason this whole ""button"" thing is stupid, because, in all likelihood, it's just like that room."

Hello, I am the creator and moderator of /r/ImaginaryMindscapes (Art of the Imagination). A subreddit specifically for featuring highly-detailed, surrealistic landscapes that leave you in awe and are very thought-provoking. We believe art is the honey pot of the soul, mind, spirit and body. The concept behind this sub was to create a community that would one day be the flagship of the /r/ImaginaryNetwork:Expanded. A catch all, broad scoped subreddit for everything the mind can dream of.   I cant claim all the credit tho. 99% of the credit goes to my co-mods/friends who helped me along the way. This is my first ""BIG"" subreddit contribution to the network and i am very proud of it and proud to be working with some ppl, i really respect and have gotten to know over the years.   /u/Lol33ta, /u/sacredserenity, /u/Chrisdogtn, /u/karmicviolence, thank you guys and gals, you've been a tremendous help. :)"

trendingsubreddits,30h8zw,oldmoneey,2,Fri Mar 27 13:41:09 2015 UTC,The smurfing one is an awesome idea but I'm a little confused why they call it smurfing...
trendingsubreddits,30h8zw,ploki122,6,Fri Mar 27 18:55:38 2015 UTC,Smurfing is the gaming term for when experienced players make some low level account or character to screw with inexperienced players.
trendingsubreddits,30h8zw,AhrmiintheUnseen,2,Fri Mar 27 20:09:58 2015 UTC,"to screw with inexperienced players.   It used to be the case, but nowadays there are a lot of reasons to smurf in various games. Sometimes your account is faction-locked (I recall Shattered Galaxy being the case), so smurfing allows you to remove that restriction.  In a lot of more competitive games (LoL and SC are like that, I don't know how other games work), the top 0.0001% players are matched only with each others, so for instance a ""Challenger"" (top 250) LoL player will only be matched with a few thousand different players. Because of that, the time to find a game can sometimes shoot up to 30-45 minutes on bad days.  You can also smurf to play with a friend/viewers without skewing the matchmaking (although it ends up skewing the matchmaking differently).  A few smurfs also do it to abuse some ""refer-a-friend"" programs (like LoL) or simply look better (like WoT).  There's also the option of changing your name without paying for it when you don't care about losing your progression."

trendingsubreddits,30h8zw,Soulwound,5,Fri Mar 27 23:41:51 2015 UTC,"It comes from a Warcraft players duo who were called ""PapaSmurf"" and something else that had to do with Smurfs (could be MamaSmurf but that's not it iirc. Basically, they were really good players who created new accounts to play against lower-end players. From there, ""smurfing"" as been coined as a term to refer to creating a new account to play on a lower level.  In this case, IRLsmurfing refers to ""In real life"" smurfing or basically doing something you're insanely good at and ""competing"" (or in many cases simply performing) at a lower level."

No SRS for me thank you, political correctness was never my thing, and SRS certainly does not have any positive aspects. Why do you think it's widely regarded as the most toxic subreddit?"
trendingsubreddits,2zznk3,trimalchio-worktime,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:38:42 2015 UTC,"So just because you, a single member of the LGBT community, doesn't take offense at homophobic jokes, no one in the LGBT community should feel offended (for reference, I am not straight, and homophobic jokes offend me).    Why do you think it's widely regarded as the most toxic subreddit?   Just because something is widely considered to be one thing, doesn't mean it is that thing automatically. In the US, the majority of people are theistic. Does this automatically mean non-theistic people are wrong? No. In Lithuania, just 6% of people are tolerant of LGBT people (lowest amount in Europe, including Russia). Does this mean LGBT people in Lithuania are doing something that is morally wrong?  I recognize that it is silly to draw a parallel between these societal observations and a frigging internet forum - but my point still stands. Especially in the truly progressive parts of Reddit (not the brocialists of /r/politics), people recognize that SRS is okay."

Not at all. Be offended, be offended aaaaaaaaall you want. But don't tell me or anyone else laughing at that joke that we can't do it. That's the beauty of it, the freedom to do what everyone wants.

It may or may not actually take off depending on how much effort people put into it.  As for what thread caused it to trend, I don't know but it could possibly be this comment. While the comment itself didn't get a lot of upvotes, it was two hops away from a comment that got 600+ karma in a thread that had 3000+ karma and was timed about right to have caused it to trend today."

trendingsubreddits,2zg254,autowikibot,4,Wed Mar 18 15:28:03 2015 UTC,"Comfort zone:       The comfort zone is a psychological state in which a person feels familiar, at ease, in control, and experiences low anxiety. A person in this state uses a limited set of behaviors to deliver a steady level of performance, usually without a sense of risk.   Judith M. Bardwick, author of Danger in the Comfort Zone, defines 'comfort zone' as ""a behavioral state where a person operates in an anxiety-neutral position"". Brené Brown, a research professor at the University of Houston Graduate College of Social Work, describes the comfort zone as: ""Where our uncertainty, scarcity and vulnerability are minimized — where we believe we’ll have access to enough love, food, talent, time, admiration. Where we feel we have some control."".  The comfort zone is the environment where satisfaction comes easily with little effort.

trendingsubreddits,2zg254,myusernameranoutofsp,-1,Wed Mar 18 16:04:39 2015 UTC,"That's why I'm here, to disable it.  There are two reasons for me. One is that it's an advertisement. It's reddit pushing content on its users. I don't want that, I want what I'm looking for, I don't want reddit trying to advertise to me to try to get me to stay longer. It's like how some news websites have a thing that slides out when you reach the end of an article, to suggest another article. Those things are a nuisance.   The second reason is that I don't think it's a good idea to check things out solely because they're popular. This is kind of a pretentious opinion that some people disagree with but I stand by it. If I wanted to find new music, I wouldn't look for what's popular, that would bring me top 40's pop music, if I want good new music then I would seek it somewhere else. I'm not really interested in what's 'trending' and I don't want it advertised to me."
trendingsubreddits,2zg254,banned_accounts,2,Wed Mar 18 17:00:36 2015 UTC,"reddit pushing content   But a sub becomes trending by having a large number of redditors interested in the sub. Reddit itself probably doesn't care what turns up here as long as it's SFW. They're technically trying to get you to stay longer, but the same argument could be used for the front page, random button, or most of the other features. If you were interested in only one or two subs, you'd go directly to those subs.  It's not quite the same as ""if you liked this, check out this"" because they're typically not related at all.   solely because they're popular   I get that, but they're often subs with good content that you wouldn't find otherwise.  That being said, finding new content is a good thing and I don't really care how people go about finding it."

trendingsubreddits,2zbwlf,eifersucht12a,18,Tue Mar 17 22:20:23 2015 UTC,I'm really not a fan of /r/thewalkingdead the show has went down in quality over the years and if you even remotely suggest that on the sub all you get is downvotes and people telling you if you don't like it leave...etc. Also the entire sub seems to have no clue what foreshadowing actually is.
trendingsubreddits,2zbwlf,rappersdo,16,Wed Mar 18 01:00:21 2015 UTC,"You can't blame them about foreshadowing, most of them have been screwed up by Breaking Bad, so every little detail ""means"" something.   However, I agree that the sub has issues, but most TV show subs do. I'd unsubscribed from them back in season 3 myself, but I do pop in on the comic discussion every month.  Also, I believe the last half of season 4 and the most of season 5 have been really good. better than season 2 and 3."

If I don't like something, I stay away from it rather than spend more time thinking about it.   You're free to do so, of course, but you can't expect a group of fans to want to engage with someone telling them there's something wrong with a thing they enjoy. If you want in depth debate, you'd do much better to seek out in academic circles rather than fan groups.

trendingsubreddits,2z3tbz,Redtube_Guy,6,Sun Mar 15 09:41:08 2015 UTC,It's difficult to say because 2ch has been the largest board system in Japan for a decade (probably) and there hasn't been comparable-scale websites. There were several migrations from a sub-board to another within 2ch but migrations to another website aren't so common.

trendingsubreddits,2yrtpy,RRopemaker,30,Thu Mar 12 08:23:11 2015 UTC,"You don't smoke a pack of cigars a day. They're reserved for special occasions. Yeah, they're not good for you, but at least you'll smell better than if you smoked a couple cigarettes."
trendingsubreddits,2yrtpy,wtfsystem,8,Thu Mar 12 07:39:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a nonsmoker so I don't really know, but I was under the impression cigars aren't normally filled with all the additives found in commercial cigarettes?   They don't seem to be smoked out in public either, so second hand smoke isn't as much as an issue. Harm yourself all you want in private."
trendingsubreddits,2yrtpy,Gabbo01,11,Thu Mar 12 08:12:03 2015 UTC,"The nicotine people receive from cigars are not as high as people think, due to the fermentation process that goes into making cigars (which removes a lot of the nicotine) and because you do not absorb the nicotine through the lining of your mouth as well as you do from your lungs (as you do not inhale cigars). Yes, a cigar is 100% tobacco. Rolling a cigar is an art form, everyone should watch a video of someone rolling them on a table. Edit: Here is an example video of one style.  Hand-rolled cigars (i.e. not gas station ""cigars"") take years to grow, ferment, age, etc before they get to a smoker and are touched by over 300 hands in that time period as every part of the process is done by hand. A moderately priced hand-rolled cigar is around $8 before taking into consideration local tobacco taxes. This means they are consumed by a different type of person and in a different way than cigarettes.   If you equate a cigarette smoker to the town drunk, a cigar smoker would be a wine connoisseur. Both drink, but they drink different types of alcohol for different reasons and in different quantities.   Studies have had difficultly quantifying what harm a cigar or two a day will cause. In fact, some suggest that the slow, steady breathing and relaxing causes a reduction in stress which has some health benefits. I don't mean to suggest that cigar smoking is harmless, but instead that it may not be as harmful as people initially assume, and that in moderation can be enjoyed without much more concern than you'd have over eating fast food or drinking wine.   Edit 2: nicotine is not inherently bad. It's kind of like caffeine. It's in a lot of things you may not realize. An ounce of eggplant has as much nicotine as you'd receive from 9 or 10 hours of exposure to 2nd hand smoke. Tomatoes have pretty high levels of nicotine also, especially when green."

trendingsubreddits,2yrtpy,HI_Handbasket,8,Thu Mar 12 15:36:20 2015 UTC,*people do not (typically) inhale cigars.  Smoke them however you like them.

trendingsubreddits,2yrtpy,Garandir,0,Thu Mar 12 20:44:08 2015 UTC,I think the first time you introduce any smoke into your lungs you'll have that.  It's a matter of mitigating/mixing the smoke with air.

trendingsubreddits,2yrtpy,wickedcold,0,Thu Mar 12 20:43:56 2015 UTC,Any and all.  You're right about how much I take into my lungs depends upon the quality of cigar.
trendingsubreddits,2yrtpy,HI_Handbasket,10,Thu Mar 12 20:23:16 2015 UTC,"Just to add on to some of the comments already posted. The reason cigarettes are so toxic is the additives, the fact they're inhaled, and the fact they're smoked multiple times throughout a day.  Cigars are pure tobacco. They are not meant to be inhaled, and most aficionados smoke in moderation.   With that said, like many behaviors, it comes with a set of risks. If you watch your weight, exercise and take care of yourself you can make those risk factors very small."
trendingsubreddits,2yrtpy,avrus,6,Thu Mar 12 20:40:24 2015 UTC,"When smoking a cigarette the smoke goes in through ones mouth, into the lungs, and out though ones nose. But when smoking a cigar, the smoke goes in through ones mouth and then out through ones mouth, there's no direct contact with smoke and lungs so it's not as bad as a cigarette. One could inhale cigar smoke like cigarette smoke, but it's unconventional."

trendingsubreddits,2yf7yl,xxxrayguy,7,Mon Mar 9 14:43:56 2015 UTC,"do you think Brawl is dying?   Depends on how you define it. Yes, many people have left the game and numbers are dropping, Apex only had ~200 entrants. But I don't think it'll ever die, it'll simply exist as it's own little community. I mean, the sub has brought people out of the woodworks who didn't have a place to talk about Brawl or didnt want to talk about it on /r/SmashBros due to being afraid of backlash. With over 300 subscribers in only a couple days, I think it shows there is still interest, and this could even be the start of a small resurgence in Brawl's competitive community. A netplay tournament was held last night, so who knows what the future holds. I'm optimistic though"

For example, a third world (developing countries) problem would literally starving to death because of the drought your region had, whereas a first world problem would be starving to death because you have a full pantry, but nothing to eat.   5th world problems became a spoof of this for people to post their troubling supernatural experiences in alternate dimensions, like this one.. More nthworlds developed and I guess they get weirder the further in you go. Hope that helped."

Politics itself is not a neutral subject - while there are basic facts, it is inherently subjective based upon the person's values. The values espoused on neutralpolitics are almost always solely from an American/Anglo-centric political philosophy - you will see plenty of references to ""natural rights,"" John Locke, and the Founding Fathers, but don't bring up Continental political philosophy because it's so entirely opposed to the perspectives in the traditional American political philosophy obsessed with ""limited government"" being an inherent good. Any ideas of Rousseau's ""General Will"" or social contract based upon a collective or society rather than the individual will be shouted down in a torrent of ""muh liberty"" ad nauseum."
trendingsubreddits,2y8502,PavementBlues,12,Sat Mar 7 10:17:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe you could come back and spend a little more time looking around:   This comment discusses Rousseau within the broader context of differing political ideologies and nobody's shouting it down. On this post, multiple commenters include Rousseau as recommended political reading. The concept of the social contract also comes up frequently in /r/NeutralPolitics. Here is just one example."
trendingsubreddits,2y8502,thisbaseball17,11,Sat Mar 7 13:03:12 2015 UTC,"If you think that, I dont think you have been spending enough time there. You have never even made a comment there.   I have helped moderate /r/neutralpolitics for 6 months, and we are no more a libertarian circlerjerk then we are a liberal one. I have seem comments that run the gamut of the political spectrum get to the top of the page, and I have personally removed comments that break the rules from both sides of the political spectrum.   We are a subreddit dedicated to neutrally discussing politics. Not neutrality in the sense that we have no bias, everyone has bias, but neutrality in the sense that we look at all arguments from all sides and judge them based solely on evidence and reasoning.  Our submission standards are incredibly strict. All submissions need to be manually approved by the moderators and the vast majority of submissions wont get approved without some minor editing, usually because the OP forgot a source somewhere.   Our comments standards are also unusually stringent (if more difficult to enforce given their volume, especially at the moment). Heck, the comment I am writing right now is against the rules and would have been removed by me or another moderator, as a chunk of it addresses you as an individual and not the ideas being presented, a big no no.   The values espoused on neutralpolitics are almost always solely from an American/Anglo-centric political philosophy - you will see plenty of references to ""natural rights,"" John Locke, and the Founding Fathers, but don't bring up Continental political philosophy because it's so entirely opposed to the perspectives in the traditional American political philosophy obsessed with ""limited government"" being an inherent good. Any ideas of Rousseau's ""General Will"" or social contract based upon a collective or society rather than the individual will be shouted down in a torrent of ""muh liberty"" ad nauseum.   And so would your comment, honestly. You make a claim without providing sources.   I would encourage everyone to not base your opinion of the subreddit on anyone elses word for it, not even mine. Go read our rules and guidlines, go read through some of our threads. Submit a post and see what happens.  Reach your own, intelligent and source based conclusion about an issue. That's why we exist."

trendingsubreddits,2y8502,wishabay,3,Sat Mar 7 20:57:05 2015 UTC,"The purpose of NeutralPolitics isn't to be politically neutral, though - it's to provide a politically neutral space where everyone can lay out their evidence and their arguments to try to figure things out.   Now, you may say that if I didn't want people to think that NeutralPolitics was a sub for politically neutral people, I shouldn't have named it ""NeutralPolitics"". I agree, and I kick myself about it every time I have this conversation. Awful name."

Capcom along with Sony will be releasing SFV at some point in the distant future on PS4 and PC. We are assuming that this console exclusivity has allowed this partnership to afford much larger prize pools at tournaments than we've ever seen before! They have dedicated $500,000 to 2015's tournament scene culminating in the Capcom Cup at the end of the year to decide the ultimate victor.  Along with following tournaments and the HYPE matches they bring, /r/streetfighter will also fancy newbie-friendly community building initiatives like the Reddit Newbie Fight Club every friday, as well as a call for Fanart and other fun posts.

trendingsubreddits,2xg28m,Werner__Herzog,15,Sat Feb 28 09:23:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're question is serious, since you're a regular on OOTL, but I'll still explain.   Basically a lot of questions (mostly about memes and reddit insider jokes, but also about hot topics like Net Neutrality Comcast) have been asked dozens of times, so we decided that we won't allow them to clutter up the front page anymore. Instead the answers are featured in the Big List of Retired Questions or FAQ. Every post on OOTL has to be manually approved before it's visible in the new queue, so we send a ton of people to the FAQ every day (on my last count we had about 700 removed submissions in a month or about 40% of all the submissions).  The wiki used to only feature links to the answers, but on occasion comments linked in the old FAQ got deleted. To avoid this the new FAQ features the best answers by /r/OutOfTheLoop users as direct quotes. Sometimes we will feature several answers on a question, especially if it is controversial. At the end of (almost) every answer, you will find a link that will lead you to the comment thread for further reading/context (hopefully it's still existent)."

It's going very well for only starting two days ago, and I'm currently in the talks with nonprofit organazations out of Canada, workers unions, student unions, as well as people who have volunteered. This is includes lawyers, web and graphic designers and developers, marketing majors, political scientists, and much more. It's crazy the support we're getting.

It actually happens sometimes already.   TBH from what I've seen on other defaults, we'd probably handle being a default pretty well. We already have a pretty strict moderation style.

trendingsubreddits,2wur24,can_the_judges_djp,18,Mon Feb 23 08:30:33 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Circlejerk, is in fact, GNU/Circlejerk, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Circlejerk. Circlejerkis not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Circlejerk”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Circlejerk, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Circlejerk is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Circlejerk is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Circlejerk added, or GNU/Circlejerk. All the so-called “Circlejerk” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Circlejerk."
trendingsubreddits,2wur24,hageza,9,Mon Feb 23 08:45:52 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said that ""GNU/Circlejerk is Circlejerk.""  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a computer scientist who studies operating system kernels, I am telling you, specifically, in the open source community, no one calls GNU/Circlejerk, Circlejerk. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""*nix family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Unix-based distributions, which includes things from Ubuntu to FreeBSD to Solaris.  So your reasoning for calling GNU/Circlejerk, Circlejerk is because random people ""call any FOSS operating system Circlejerk?"" Let's get Haiku and ReactOS in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a Micro$oft shill or a brainwashed consumer? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. GNU/Circlejerk is GNU+Circlejerk and a member of the *nix family. But that's not what you said. You said GNU/Circlejerk is Circlejerk, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the *nix family Circlejerk, which means you'd call FreeBSD, Solaris, and other operating systems Circlejerk, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

Mods get a bad rap on reddit but really it's just a case of ""When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all."" The cases of mods being twits get a lot of attention, but that's just a tiny minority of mods acting out publicly.   The other mods just volunteer their time to help improve their subreddits and contribute to the communities present there. For instance, you don't want to know how many terrible photos of urban stuff we're forced to remove every day at /r/EarthPorn. If we want to make sure our rules are obeyed and a standard of quality is upheld, we have to step in and clean up.  Of course, some folks take offense with how mods run their subs. Heck, everyone does, even I think /r/gifs' rule 3 is stupid, for example. But that doesn't mean 99% of mods are petulant children oppressing the people.

EDIT: Since I'm getting spartic replies here and there and since they're all pretty much the same, let me go ahead and reply to them here.  1: I don't care that you're not getting paid. Nobody is forcing you to be a mod. You're choosing to be one of your own volition. Going into a mod position knowing that, why would you then turn around and tell anyone critical of you that ""Well I'm not getting paid so there!""

And I'm not looking down on anyone. Stating that a particular form of entertainment is in the realm of children doesn't make it inferior to adults, it's simply a different realm. I brought up the phrase ""children's books"" to explain how the discussion of one is relevant to the discussion of another. Had someone started talking about how much better Dostoyevsky is than Stan Lee, then you'd have a point about their comment being irrelevant.

trendingsubreddits,2w24kt,Duke0fWellington,-6,Mon Feb 16 12:57:17 2015 UTC,"It was quite a few years ago but a friend of mine has a great story from hitchhiking in England. He and his friend (both American) were just randomly tramping around the country. Some guy in an old pickup truck picked them up on a country road and drove them into town. When they told him their story, he called a woman he knew who came and got them and brought them to her house. She was going out of town for a few weeks and told them they were welcome to hang out and house sit if they wanted to.  A week or so after she left, her son showed up with a bunch of his friends and they proceeded to party together for the next week, smoking massive amounts of weed. At the end of the first week, they came down and spoke to the two Americans. ""Excuse me, but we've been discussing it and realized that none of us are sure which of us know you.""  There was also a point where he was zoned out on the couch, stoned out of his mind, when the doorbell rang. He opened it and there was a little kid standing on the step, holding a can. ""Money for crib death, guv'ner?"" Being American, he didn't quite understand the slang and asked him ""What?"" That's when another voice spoke up and he realized there was an enormous man in a fancy suit standing behind the kid. ""You know, little babies dying in their cribs."" My friend told the guy to hold on and went and got the guy who actually lived in the house.  When he got there, the kid repeated his spiel. ""Money for crib death, guv'ner?"" and the guy responded ""That depends, are you for or against it?"""
trendingsubreddits,2w24kt,gaardyn,5,Mon Feb 16 15:23:54 2015 UTC,"I would like to believe your story, and I might if it weren't for the Dickensian charity kid at the end. In Britain they are called cots, and no one says governor."

trendingsubreddits,2w24kt,TheExaltedFox,3,Mon Feb 16 20:32:52 2015 UTC,"Really? In my experience, gfy's generally have better framerates than standard gifs."
trendingsubreddits,2w24kt,vgman20,0,Tue Feb 17 04:50:52 2015 UTC,"Probably because they have no file size limit, you can upload an original gif with a much higher frame rate than other hosts .  /r/HQG has 20 frame per second min and a lot of the gfys will have original gif 20mb or sometimes over  100mb .  Compare tumblr with 2mb max mast of the gifs are 10 fps . I'd have to check to be sure but I don't think gfycat decimates the frame rate from the source. If the source is a gif or webm, that original file is preserved."

To each their own, though, I suppose, and it's also possible that I just don't encounter quality gfys."
trendingsubreddits,2w24kt,TheExaltedFox,0,Tue Feb 17 16:27:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe you have a point about quality, but they don't load faster? That's odd - considering they're so much smaller"

The evil within sucked, but dishonored and Wolfenstein were surprisingly amazing games.   The thing is, when you think Bethesda, you think Fallout. We HAVE to have more. The last few games are being kept alive with mods, but we need a modern engine Fallout to tide us over until the actual Apocalypse."

I don't know what else to say here, so I'll share some interesting statistics about the subreddit's growth today because of this video. This is a pair of graphs showing our uniques and pageviews by hour. This is a graph of our growth over the entire life of the subreddit, taken from reddit metrics. The spikes on that graph are from when Jeremy tweeted about us occasionally, but it's obvious that it's nothing compared to the video. You can also see from the redditmetrics site, that we are now rank 7,637 when it comes to all subreddits. We also had a trending score of 7,775%, which is to my understanding the highest in a while (probably wrong though).

trendingsubreddits,2vedw8,autowikibot,3,Tue Feb 10 20:01:32 2015 UTC,"The Wheel of Time:       The Wheel of Time is a series of epic fantasy novels written by American author James Oliver Rigney, Jr., under the pen name Robert Jordan. Originally planned as a six-book series, The Wheel of Time now spans fourteen volumes, in addition to a prequel novel and a companion book. Jordan began writing the first volume, The Eye of the World, in 1984. It was published in January 1990.   The author died in 2007 while working on what was planned to be the twelfth and final volume in the series. He prepared extensive notes so another author could complete the book according to his wishes. Fellow fantasy author and long-time Wheel of Time fan Brandon Sanderson was brought in to complete the final book, but during the writing process it was decided that the book would be far too large to be published in one volume and would instead be published as three volumes:  The Gathering Storm (2009), Towers of Midnight (2010), and A Memory of Light (2013).  The series draws on numerous elements of both European and Asian mythology, most notably the cyclical nature of time found in Buddhism and Hinduism, the metaphysical concepts of balance and duality, and a respect for nature found in Daoism. Additionally, its creation story has similarities to Christianity's ""Creator"" (Light) and Shai'tan, ""The Dark One"" (Shaytan is an Arabic word which in religious contexts is used as a name for the Devil). It was also partly inspired by Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace (1869).

trendingsubreddits,2v6e4g,Hereibe,14,Mon Feb 9 05:52:13 2015 UTC,"Well my first thought was ""holy shit, this has 10k subs?"" and then I went and realized MUA has +200k. It's really incredible how big and diverse this website is - but even so, I would've never guessed MUA was that big.   First impression: wow, this sub has a lot of link posts. I'm used to circlejerk subs being mostly text. I feel like that probably reflects MUA though, it makes sense that most of the posts there are pictures so it also makes sense that its parody is mostly pictures.   There was a ton of acronyms that didn't mean anything to me (naturally). But I definitely learned some things about MUA culture: skin should be pale. You need the real product, knockoffs are no good (I think this is a common cj in a lot of subs directly or indirectly about buying stuff - definitely recognize it from /r/coffee, /r/food, /r/malefashionadvice etc.). There is no such thing as personal taste, either you agree with the mainstream opinion or you're wrong (which is true of basically every circlejerk on reddit).  muacirclejerk has a pretty intense sense of humor! The butthole pic definitely caught me off guard. The jokes in the comments that made sense to me were generally very funny.   All in all, really funny sub, seemed to have a healthy attitude about a lot of stuff. Will probably check out again in the future. Even though it will still mean very little to me.   Generally speaking, I think reading subreddits for subcultures and special interest groups that I'm not part of can be a really enlightening experience - just seeing the everyday thoughts and doings of people I don't have a lot in common with."

The reason for no filters/photoshop is so people can accurately see the makeup and judge how good the products and the application are.   you MUST be endlessly positive, like MUST BE.   In MUA, if you offer any mild or helpful criticism people will view it as a direct attack on them instead of their makeup application skills, and immediately attack/downvote/call for the mods.  This sucks because no one can offer any help, they can only say ""u look gorgeous! xo"", ""just like [celebrity!]"", etc. If they give any criticism at all it's usually between five compliments so people don't get mad.   no throwing rocks at cats that shine   This is probably based off a specific post that I missed. Clearly I need to cj harder. DX  If I had to guess, it's because there's lots of albums that end with ""lol look at my cat! How did this cat get into my makeup album, silly cat!""

trendingsubreddits,2uyun5,Radek_Of_Boktor,5,Fri Feb 6 13:34:29 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they had a big subscriber influx.

trendingsubreddits,2uyun5,Captrotc,7,Fri Feb 6 15:59:39 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't really be possible to write a bit for that, since the reasons are different every time. Sometimes it's a matter of a small sub being linked in a larger sub, sometimes it's an event related to the sub causing people to go looking for the sub, sometimes it's simply a matter of an event causing an increase in activity of the current subscribers with no discernable affect on subscriber numbers. There's really no way for a bot to determine that."
trendingsubreddits,2uyun5,gaardyn,1 point,Fri Feb 6 14:25:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not a programmer, so this is just logical thinking talking here, but could reddit monitor for massive upswings in intrareddit traffic? Like, if a specific comment brought a ton of traffic to a specific sub, say a comment in an /r/askreddit thread, could that be picked up and posted?  It wouldn't be perfect, but if there's a single driver of subreddit traffic, it may help."
trendingsubreddits,2uyun5,jaesin,2,Fri Feb 6 19:04:43 2015 UTC,"It's extremely simple to track how many people click on a particular link. It would be slightly less trivial to track how many people click on a particular link and then click on subscribe, but still easily doable. Those instances would be simple enough for a bot to track. It's the other instances that wouldn't be as easily trackable. For instance, /r/Dota2 trended back when the big International championship was taking place. There probably want a particular comment linking to the sub that caused it to trend, it was probably an increase in discussion by already existing subscribers that triggered it, possibly convinced with people who knew the sub existed but didn't normally subscribe who went to check out the tournament coverage. Something like that wouldn't be detectable by a bot.   There's also the matter of them keeping what can make a sub trend secret, so as to make it harder to game the system."

trendingsubreddits,2uyun5,flyingtulipss,4,Fri Feb 6 14:52:39 2015 UTC,"mock those who distort and misinterpret jihad   Sure, if that's how you interpret it; however, I think it's safe to say that most people subscribed to that subreddit really believe that jihad is just that: Muslims killing themselves and other people in the name of God.   That subreddit is misinterpreting what Islam is really about; it doesn't even mention in the sidebar that only a minority of Muslims are suicide bombers. I'm sure if I made a subreddit purely dedicated to Christian priests being child molesters or Jewish people being in love with money or atheists being nothing but raging bigots, there will be some outrage from the reddit community."

trendingsubreddits,2u292b,reddit,11,Thu Jan 29 08:04:23 2015 UTC,I can do about 3 pushups before my arms collapse and I fall to the ground.
trendingsubreddits,2u292b,metobi,11,Thu Jan 29 10:14:19 2015 UTC,"Standing pushups are much easier. If I'm doing pushups against a wall, I can do at least 5 before I get tired. Be careful, though, as you continue to do them, you can get too swole and not realize how much your strength has increased. One day you'll push off so hard you'll fall over backwards, with your arms being so massive that you can get rolled over to get back up. At this point, just resign yourself to doing situps instead."

trendingsubreddits,2ty17i,oildig,1 point,Wed Jan 28 21:07:25 2015 UTC,holy shit... /r/morbidlybeautiful was not something I planned on experiencing today
trendingsubreddits,2ty17i,Kvothe24,-7,Thu Jan 29 02:51:55 2015 UTC,"I realize these are the trending subreddits, but I don't think reddit should be promoting a subreddit (/r/GreenDawn) which encourages people to litter and vandalize (""Your mission... to place little Army men throughout your hometown and businesses you come upon..."").  Not to mention that the fun they're having comes at the expense of innocent janitors and maintenance crews who have to clean up after them."
trendingsubreddits,2ty17i,oildig,4,Wed Jan 28 19:03:52 2015 UTC,"Creator, here.  I really can't consider it ""vandalism."" We have mentioned several times to not glue troops to any surfaces. I'm not sure about ""littering,"" either. It's more like putting a knick knack on a shelf. Do you really think it's a big deal?  As an aside, you'll find an interesting story between janitors and employees of a place where a member of /r/GreenDawn works. Everyone had a lot of fun with it. I doubt any janitors out there are getting very upset about picking up an extra army man here and there with other things they pick up every day.  Cheers,   Over."
trendingsubreddits,2ty17i,Kvothe24,-7,Wed Jan 28 19:08:14 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it bother you if someone came to where you work and left a mess that you had to clean up?
trendingsubreddits,2ty17i,oildig,2,Wed Jan 28 19:20:59 2015 UTC,You make it sound like we're spewing garbage everywhere. We aren't encouraging people to throw handfulls of trash all over the place.   Would it bother me if someone came to where I work and put little green army men sporadically around the building?   No. It would not. I likely would not notice them.
trendingsubreddits,2ty17i,Kvothe24,-6,Wed Jan 28 19:23:30 2015 UTC,"If it doesn't bother anybody then maybe there really isn't a problem.  Maybe the fish don't mind either when army men get washed into their streams (I'm referring here to army men left outdoors).  But if a janitor ever gets pissed off at having to clean up after a greendawner, then you're just having fun at that person's expense, and you're all culpable.  You erroneously assume that others wouldn't mind cleaning up after your members just because you wouldn't, which allows you to dismiss the notion that there might be victims to your lulz.  I haven't gone through all the posts, but I can imagine that there is at least one janitor out there who feels tormented by little green army men and the people who put them there.  Pretty funny, huh?"
trendingsubreddits,2ty17i,gaardyn,2,Wed Jan 28 19:48:45 2015 UTC,"I think you're haing a pretty serious overreaction and making claims that are not true.   I did not ""erroneously assume that others wouldn't mind cleaning up after our members just caues I don't."" I am fully aware that out there, there could be someone who could be upset by this. At the same time, I would think that person is being silly if they freak out over having to pick up an army man tha thas fallen on the ground.    I can imagine that there is at least one janitor out there who feels tormented by little green army men and the people who put them there. Pretty funny, huh?   Do you think there is some janitor out there ripping his hair out over having to clean up an army man here and there? I would say he shouldn't be a janitor and has some anger issues if that were the case.   In regards to your fish remark, I don't know why people would be putting army men near streams in the first place. Our goal is to put them places were people may stumble upon them at some point in the future. Putitng them in a tree in the woods is pointless. However, if you'd like to go all Environmental Justice Warrior, I'd suggest you start working on the issue of billions of plastic water bottles being dumped in the ocean. That is surely a larger issue than the chance that an army man or two may somehow make it into a stream."
trendingsubreddits,2ty17i,oildig,0,Wed Jan 28 20:01:45 2015 UTC,"If a janitor gets pissed off about having to pick up a few innocuous toys, they're in the wrong business. You're talking about a miniscule amount of work, work that they're paid to do. I, for one, wouldn't mind doing a tiny bit of extra work if it brings several other people happiness. I guess that's what happens when you don't have a stick so far up your ass that it makes you hoarse."
trendingsubreddits,2ty17i,gaardyn,0,Wed Jan 28 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"Do you really think that a janitor can distinguish between litter that was left for ""happiness"" and litter that was left for spite?  It's one thing to say that it's easy to clean up if the army men are left in plain sight, but no, they're carefully hidden within view, which makes it much harder for a janitor to do his job when he's not expecting to find his workplace ""booby trapped"" with litter.  How long does it take him to notice?  And might his boss notice first and then criticize the janitor for not doing his job properly?  You can say he's just doing the job he's getting paid for, but the reality is that it's a shitty job made slightly shittier by selfish greendawners who have no qualms regarding ""collateral damage"".  I'd rather have a stick up my ass than risk shoving it up someone else's for laughs."

trendingsubreddits,2ty17i,Knolligge,-4,Wed Jan 28 21:20:20 2015 UTC,"It isn't unrelated at all. Studies have shown a link between having a small penis and getting unnaturally upset at extremely minor situations that have no personally bearing on you.   You might have won the argument, though.

We are hoping that is one of the things addressed in this ""Big announcement"")  PvP is equal playing field, where everyone has access to the same gear and equal level. Unless you are doing WvWvW (world vs world vs world server fights) which artificial scales you to max level (80) but you aren't as strong as a full 80.   Leveling up itself is enjoyable if you don't view it as ""I need to do this chore to get to the real game at 80""  Also, I should let you know. Mesmer is not like GW1 mesmer.

Guilds are still helpful, but it's for very large scale stuff that scales to the number of players.  So it's rare to find a guild with any sort of 'raiding schedule' type stuff going on, and even then, there is not a lot of it and it's not as much of a focus like end game raids in WoW for example..  You're free to just tag along when you are there.  I have since moved on (if anything it was a bit too casual for me - but then friends and I have gone back to EQ1 for it's old-school-ness at times too), but I wish more games would copy the 'quest' system of GW2.  At least that's my experience when I played the year or so after launch.  Best part though, I can just go right back in at any time since there is no subscription."

This amazing 'breakdown' of the ludicrous pricing scheme for the game was by /u/cache_22    Evolve's website explaining DLC is a confusing mess. Here's a chart they desperately needed:    Edition Price Maps Hunters Monsters Monster Skins    Standard $59.99 12 12 3 0   Pre-Order $59.99 12 12 4 (1 pre-order) 1 (pre-order)   Digital Deluxe $79.99 12 16 (4 Season Pass) 4 (1 pre-order) 4 (1 pre-order and 3 Season Pass)   PC Monster Race $99.99 12 18 (4 Season Pass and 2 DLC) 5 (1 pre-order and 1 DLC) 8 (1 pre-order, 3 Season Pass, 4 timed exclusive)      DLC Price (Value) Maps Hunters Monsters Monster Skins    Monster Expansion pack $14.99 0 0 1 (Behemoth) 1   Season Pass $24.99 0 4 0 3    Notes:    The fourth monster known as Behemoth will be pre-order DLC. The fourth monster was revealed as DLC in January 2014. Evolve was originally going to be released on October 21, 2014 and it was delayed to February 10, 2015. The four ""PC Monster Race"" exclusive skins are only timed exclusive for 30 days.     DLC was planned as early as January 2014.  Also note, buying the standard edition of the game, AND the season pass, still leaves you short 2 hunter characters and 1 monster which must be purchased separately.  This is a 60 dollar game with no single player mode (Unless you count multiplayer with bots as single player)."
trendingsubreddits,2t5hu5,AirPhforce,7,Wed Jan 21 20:32:55 2015 UTC,"The game reminds me most of titanfall. No particular singleplayer mode (for the most part) But a multi-player that's getting a lot of hype towards it.   Titanfall dropped off after a bit for some people and it feels like announcing all the DLC beforehand gives people a reason to stay on until it drops for everyone else. Titanfall in my opinion had lots of decent DLC that was really fun, but they'd already lost some people by then. Evolve's going the opposite way and hopefully they can prove that they're not just cash-grabbing with the DLC. At least every default still looks fun.   Thay are slightly catering towards Pc though. I got to download the alpha because i had XCOM on steam and whilst it does feel like that's because it's an easier distribution platform, the 'exclusive' skins is a bit cheap."

trendingsubreddits,2sx5p4,Kirbychu,2,Mon Jan 19 16:20:00 2015 UTC,"Nintendo Direct is basically a stream they do to inform the public of their plans with games and such.   For example, on the most recent Nintendo Direct, it was announced that there would be a new Fire Emblem game coming soon.   These directs are an easy way to address public concerns and stuff. I personally think that the semi-predictability of when these occur is one of the reasons you don't see that many leaks of Nintendo games, only the really really gigantic ones."

It's pretty much like that except Nintendo does it every so often to provide updates on future releases. They're basically glorified but fun and silly 10~45 minute advertisements.  Sometimes it may have a specific game they want to talk about (like Smash 4 or Mario Kart 8 last April), so they theme it as such and show what developments have been made regarding the game and its release date. Usually the higher ups (President Satoru Iwata, your NoA/NoE/NoAU/etc. key figures) ""host"" the show and present the game and maybe its dev team if it's a bit more significant, but for some themed Directs the project lead is the one doing the majority of the presentation.  If you're familiar with the issues with the Pokemon Bank being delayed, this is where ""Please Understand"" comes from as it was one of the things President Iwata said on a Direct to try and address the setback and is generally one of his go to lines for problematic matters."

That one is a fairly tame one considering the eccentricity of something like the Tomodachi Life Direct (11 minutes long) or the 50-Fact Extravaganza for Super Smash Bros. for Wii U (~35 minutes long).  I think the closest comparison I can think of is if you mix a bit of that ""As Seen on TV!"" cheesiness, with the Home Shopping Network presentation, and make the product being sold be Nintendo games and hardware. You wouldn't think it would work but it does really well. I think it comes from the fact that you get an adorable old Japanese man trying his hardest to speak clear English, the pure joy and enthusiasm everyone presenting (devs and executives alike) brings forward, and the fact that there isn't any uprendered bull like you would get from other companies like EA/Ubisoft."

But don't be shy, /r/TrueFilm is kind to new users, and as long as you follow the rules, you should have a great time. We have a chatroom if you wanted to talk with the mods about future posts and whatnot.  However, if you're a rule breaker, and just want to talk about film without going as in-depth, /r/flicks is a nice middle ground between /r/movies and /r/TrueFilm. I also happen to be a mod at /r/flicks, and we also have a chatroom there, so again, don't be shy.   Honestly, I think the biggest difference between the two, is /r/flicks is more for discussing a movie immediately after seeing it. /r/TrueFilm is after you give a week to ponder over its ideas, and come up with a major theme for your post. (Under the Skin and gender relations, Man with a Movie Camera and the fourth wall, etc.)  Not really a diss towards either subreddit, as I love them both, but just an observation. I'd really recommend giving both a try, and seeing what you like, as maybe you'll like both, a specific one, or neither.

trendingsubreddits,2stdi6,skippythemoonrock,1 point,Sun Jan 18 16:51:56 2015 UTC,"Gravity bomb does fairly low damage. Its the pull and the knockback that is dangerous.     Three sniper is a two shot center mass, three on wings.    The anchor Is probably the hardest weapon to hit. Its usually a oneshot but it is survivable.     The hammer might be a bit op at the moment though. You can either flail around the hammers and deal 50% each hit. Or hold the fire button down for a charged attack that launches yourself forward an swings both hammers at once for a one shot kill."

The guy was an idiot and deserved to be downvoted but when any other inappropriate comment is made in /r/trendingsubreddits, they might get down to -5 or -10. If it's a patently offensive comment, it might hit -20.

trendingsubreddits,2s9kwt,EntropicReaver,2,Tue Jan 13 13:14:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, Pagans and Wiccans, and I imagine a few other religions/spiritual practices tend to believe herbs, minerals, and other natural things have magical properties. Are you really that surprised? It's herblore, not herbal knowledge."
trendingsubreddits,2s9kwt,Erzsabet,3,Tue Jan 13 20:33:25 2015 UTC,"I understand that, what I'm talking about is that the discussions are not ""x was used for y purpose and here is some context as to why they believed that"", but rather ""X will literally give you the ability to fly"""
trendingsubreddits,2s9kwt,EntropicReaver,2,Tue Jan 13 22:23:21 2015 UTC,"The only thing I see like that is ""I've seen Fly Agaric featured in some flying ointment blends, which I believe merits an increase of exploration into transdermal applications of amanita preparations."" and I think that's meant in a different context. The rest seem to be medically based, and historically."

trendingsubreddits,2s9kwt,gaardyn,5,Tue Jan 13 19:57:33 2015 UTC,Millions of people have no problem with it.   And lots of others do. Why not use names that are easier to use for everyone and don't shut out certain people when it comes to discussing the subreddits?
trendingsubreddits,2s9kwt,linkybaa,-4,Tue Jan 13 20:00:38 2015 UTC,Because those subreddits are doing just fine without input from people who think everything should be changed to suit their own personal beliefs. They're probably better off without such people.

I can think of a dozen reasons why that would happen. Are some of these reasons the result of prudish thinking or societal norms? Yes, but it's a leap of logic to think the users are always perpetrating these thoughts themselves.  And it's not that the word ""porn"" is embarrassing because porn is embarrassing. It's the same reason why terrible memes are terrible and why anyone ""speaking in memes"" in real life is being needlessly ostracizing. That's what the -porn suffix is being. Needlessly ostracizing."

There's always /r/bodybuilding/ for those whose fitness goals are primarily growth and aesthetics.  No need for the hate. I myself get downvoted on a regular basis for unknown reasons but who is really going to get butthurt over an arbitrary numerical value like karma? I'm there to vibe with the more supportive users rather than wonder why the downvoting douchebags dislike me.  You can't please everyone so all you can do is contribute where possible and train hard.  Edit: words.

One of the newer subreddits is about posting gifs of Leonardo Dicaprio, one is for a guy who got a and name from a website and decided to become a ""musician"", and the third is about posting recipes. They don't really have a ""natural order"" yet and they aren't really ""gems"" at this point. In my opinion, anyways."

trendingsubreddits,2s1nwt,Bossman1086,1 point,Sun Jan 11 22:20:04 2015 UTC,"We don't have a specific goal of what content we want to see be the end result. As moderators we're trying not to guide the subreddit in any specific direction. There was a post with this idea before I actually created the subreddit on /r/TheoryOfReddit talking about the idea as an experiment in community defined content. The idea is instead of creating a new subreddit based on a specific topic, over time the democratic process will eliminate topics and/or types of posts from the subreddit until it becomes more focused. It won't be a free-for-all for very long.  As for voting sources, we haven't worked everything out yet. But we've looked in to minimum requirements for the accounts voting, using a Google Form, etc. One of our moderators is also a web developer and is looking into making a new web app using reddit's API to deal with it off-site. More details will come once we announce the first voting thread though."

trendingsubreddits,2s1nwt,giggs123,1 point,Sun Jan 11 09:15:08 2015 UTC,The idea is any content is allowed and then frequent votes by the community decide what topics or content is no longer allowed until we reach a focused subset of content that the community wants.   Isn't that basically just the Reddit front page though? Maybe i just don't fully understand.
trendingsubreddits,2s1nwt,Bossman1086,3,Sun Jan 11 22:59:39 2015 UTC,"In a sense, I guess. But each subreddit that the submission you're voting on on your front page comes from has its own set of arbitrary rules of what you can and can't post set by one or more moderators. This puts those choices directly in the hands of the community. It's not just what content they want to see, they also get more of a voice (in theory)."

trendingsubreddits,2ry49l,vivameiguo,1 point,Sat Jan 10 18:18:19 2015 UTC,"It only took 450 subscribers because there were barely any subscribers to begin with. That subscriber growth occurred naturally, though. Had they created 450 shill accounts, the admins likely would have noticed the massive infux of brand new subscribers to a tiny sub.  Even so, while it's relatively easy to make a small sub trend, there's no guarantee that it will get the sub mentioned on the front page. They still have to be randomly selected from the qualifying subs."

We're no doubt trending today because just recently we have two major events within a few hours of each other: Elon Musk hosted an AMA, which caused our subreddit to collectively explode, then there was a lot of traffic to view the launch of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Dragon spacecraft to the ISS.  So what is SpaceX exactly? I'll let our Wiki do the talking:   SpaceX (Space Exploration Technologies) was founded by Elon Musk in June 2002, to help speed the development of cheap access to space. In March 2006, after less than 4 years of development; SpaceX launched their first rocket, Falcon 1. The rocket suffered an engine failure less than 30 seconds into flight, but it set in motion a series of events which eventually led to SpaceX becoming the first private company to develop a liquid fueled rocket that made it successfully to Earth orbit, in September 2008.  They have since developed the Falcon 9, a nine-engine, two-stage rocket which SpaceX hopes will become the worlds first truly reusable rocket. Launching first in June 2010, Falcon 9, along with Dragon, SpaceX's orbital capsule, have been contracted by NASA for a 12-flight program under the Commercial Resupply Services program (CRS), which sees Dragon delivery cargo and equipment to the ISS before safely returning additional material back to Earth.  Falcon 9 has had 14 successful flights out of 14 launches, and SpaceX is rapidly progressing towards readying its Falcon Heavy launch vehicle, which is due for its first launch in 2015 from Cape Canaveral.     All we ask is this: Read our rules, read our FAQ, & read our Wiki before posting or commenting. We have a very technically-minded fanbase consisting of many engineers & employees, and the level of discussion can be intimidating at times, but we have an amazing ever growing FAQ and community.   So come along and enjoy the ride! We have another launch attempt for CRS-5 happening on January 9 at approximately 5AM EST!"

Edit: Out of curiosity to whether or not there's a call for it, I just created /r/picsandstories as a place to post pictures and tell the stories behind them."
trendingsubreddits,2raas1,gaardyn,2,Sun Jan 4 13:17:24 2015 UTC,"Because a lot of the time sob story pics get upvoted not because the picture is interesting, or because the story makes it interesting, but because the story is sad and redditors are saps."
trendingsubreddits,2raas1,Level100ProtWarrior,-4,Sun Jan 4 15:54:46 2015 UTC,I still fail to see what's wrong with that.
trendingsubreddits,2raas1,gaardyn,3,Sun Jan 4 18:26:52 2015 UTC,You end up with a subreddit of highly upvoted boring photos with boring stories attached.
trendingsubreddits,2raas1,I_want_hard_work,-4,Sun Jan 4 18:34:47 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't be upvoted if people didn't appreciate them. If you don't want to see such things, then nobody expects you to subscribe to such a subreddit, but it seems ridiculous to me when people complain about something that the majority clearly doesn't have a problem with. The complaints aren't going to achieve anything besides spreading negative feelings. Just unsubscribe and move on to a subreddit that shares your philosophy."
trendingsubreddits,2raas1,Baelorn,2,Sun Jan 4 18:37:49 2015 UTC,"The point is that you're using a subreddit called ""pics"" more as a medium to tell stories. Instead, for actual pictures, you'd need to go to /r/itookacpicture or other subs. /r/pics isn't photography, it's stories with a picture attached. In itself it's not a bad thing, but the fact that it's as ""A place to share photographs and pictures"" is a little odd."
trendingsubreddits,2raas1,I_want_hard_work,2,Sun Jan 4 18:43:35 2015 UTC,"I don't see why that's a problem, though. If the story is fabricated for attention, then sure, that's bad, but life is made up of sob stories. Why should they be suppressed?   Because 99% of them are ""piction"" (picture fiction) for a cheap karma grab and they portray them as true.  Half the time the top comment is pointing out the repost with an exact same title. I want to see some cool pictures."

trendingsubreddits,2raas1,gaardyn,2,Sun Jan 4 18:09:51 2015 UTC,"So the way that math works is that 99% are a cheap karma grab, half of the top comments are pointing out reposts, and assuming no interaction between terms that gives us 49.5% of /r/pics being sob story reposts.  A slight over estimation, but not by much."
trendingsubreddits,2raas1,OlderThanGif,1 point,Sun Jan 4 20:57:30 2015 UTC,Why is it a problem if the story is fabricated? Shouldn't compelling fiction be encouraged?
trendingsubreddits,2raas1,canipaybycheck,6,Mon Jan 5 02:49:17 2015 UTC,"If you're acknowledging it as fiction, then maybe. But there's a difference between feeling something from a work of fiction and feeling something from a real life tragedy. Manipulating people's emotions by claiming something is real when it wasn't is a bit unfair, in my opinion."
trendingsubreddits,2raas1,Gottheit,1 point,Sun Jan 4 16:10:04 2015 UTC,"Hm I can see where that can go wrong. On the other hand, I was a big fan of how the Blair Witch Project was originally promoted (fake Internet sites to convince people it was real). I think the bigger problem with fake stories on /r/pics is that the stories are usually kind of lame."

trendingsubreddits,2raas1,howl3r96,12,Mon Jan 5 15:10:08 2015 UTC,What do you mean why? They gained a lot of subscribers recently. Isn't that what the trending means.
trendingsubreddits,2raas1,Dsh5,11,Sun Jan 4 09:43:43 2015 UTC,"Trending could also mean they are getting the most new content, or the content with the most upvotes relative to the rest of Reddit. It's not clear."
trendingsubreddits,2raas1,gaardyn,2,Sun Jan 4 10:20:47 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. If you check http://redditmetrics.com/. The fastest growing subs (i.e. most subscribers on a day etc.) aren't the ones that end up here. If it was about that it would be the same subreddits every day. I assume the algorithm takes the following into consideration: subscriptions relative to subreddit size, the traffic and activity. But I don't think they'll reveal what exactly is taken into account, because people will try to play the system."

trendingsubreddits,2raas1,impreprex,2,Sun Jan 4 19:57:49 2015 UTC,Think they mean a reason like when smaller subs are linked in an already big sub
trendingsubreddits,2raas1,evanc1411,3,Sun Jan 4 19:59:00 2015 UTC,"If they were explicit about why subs were trending, people would start gaming the system to get their subs trending."
trendingsubreddits,2raas1,gaardyn,1 point,Sun Jan 4 19:09:47 2015 UTC,Most of the time somebody mentions a subreddit in conversation.   People who didn't know about said sub go there look to see if it's any good.   Or something big hits and small sub and people go there to see what the hype is all about.
trendingsubreddits,2raas1,ArmoredTent,2,Sun Jan 4 16:06:47 2015 UTC,"Haha, I didn't know we could comment on trending subreddits.  I think that's actually pretty cool."

Here's some fun facts and excerpts about PC gaming that usually get systematically swept under the rug:   You can use any controller on PC You can emulate nearly any console game on PC for free (including MAME stuff) PC gaming is cheaper than console gaming PC has more exclusive games PC has more games (it's a much more open platform) You can build a PC for $400-$450 (depending on sales) that will outperform a PS4 or XBox One console You can use stuff like SoftXPand to turn your single-display PC into a local multiplayer machine (up to 16 simultaneous people playing in their own ""terminal"" PCs are easier to repair, maintain, and upgrade (by far, you just pop the hood rather than send it to the factory) Building a PC is fun and easy for most, like Legos   The subreddit has a tongue-in-cheek atmosphere, with a serious heart, welcoming those interested in learning more about the glory of everything PC.

Not to mention, how much harm the new consoles are doing to the industry by enforcing licensing fees, paid exclusivity, and mandatory online fees.  In 2015, consoles exist solely to make you re-buy hardware you already own so you can play games with a controller (that only they produce), and pay (the creators of the console) for online access to do so (so you can play ONLY with other people who also purchased the same device/game/peripherals and pay monthly for said access).  There is no performance/special capability benefit for games running on the modern console hardware as there was in the past (For example, consoles could do color graphics or scrolling tiles whereas PCs could not. PCs have since evolved to do everything consoles could, and consoles moved a step back by just grabbing at a weaker version of what PCs have had since 2011).  There is no benefit to gamers having to buy multiple instances of the same hardware to play what they could have played on a $400 PC and any controller they wanted (without brand/generation segregation or online fees).  There is no benefit to developers having to spend R&D money getting their game to run on several platforms when they could have just chosen one.  Consoles aren't what they used to be, and their relevance in the current year is entirely artificial. Paid exclusivity, puppet journalists, and advertisements are all they have left. Anything a console can do, a similarly priced PC can run that same software at same or better detail levels.    Will add arguments as they appear. Edit: Things actually went pretty well. Enjoy all this information, reddit. We'll gladly help you out over at /r/PCMasterRace, /r/AskPCGamers, and /r/KillYourConsole if you're willing. It's not for everyone, but it's definitely a viable candidate for 90% of the people that buy consoles these days. They're just no good anymore and have since been replaced by the PC, which has greatly improved in the last ~5-8 years."

trendingsubreddits,2r34x3,alien_from_Europa,3,Sat Jan 3 06:35:52 2015 UTC,"That soon won't be true! Next year, Steam Machines (even some with Windows that boots to Steam Big Picture) will be available that you can plug into a TV, come with a controller, and work right out of the box. However, the downside is that they will be more expensive, some even as much as $1K USD. What you have to take into account is that you can buy games for far, far cheaper and there is no fee for online. $60/year for internet gaming through XBOX Live Gold for 10 years is $600! Free on PC. In the long run, your pre-built will be much cheaper if you would like to own more than 10 games in your library. And don't forget the superior graphics.   Of course, building your own will be much cheaper and your machine could be far more powerful than a pre-built. That's the trade-off you have to consider.  Edit: As an example, I turned my old windows laptop into a home theater PC that boots to Steam through some simple steps. Got KODI for my movies/tv/music/etc. as well as a few other home theater programs. Bought a mini keyboard remote that lights up and has a touchpad on it for $30 (plug-and-play, no install required). And hooked up my Wii Mote to it as well. Here is a picture, and yes, that is 542 games (sorry for potato phone pic): http://i.imgur.com/6YTqGjS.jpg"

With a PC, you can just change the graphics settings and resolution to achieve the framerate you desire. Consoles are stuck at the framerate the developer decided on regardless, even if GPU-hogging things like bloom and HDR are locked on. With a PC, you're able to set the settings to your exact visual and performance preference.   the only reason a game cannot work is shitty devs   Likewise on PC, unless you mean things like graphics drivers. In which case, you'd have to download and install a previous version if a later/beta release ever made a game unplayable. There's also Ubisoft, but their games tend to equally not work on every platform."

trendingsubreddits,2r34x3,Tiwenty,23,Fri Jan 2 10:16:46 2015 UTC,"They are on a trend of releasing unfinished / broken games nowadays. It started I guess with Watch Dogs, the game was nowhere near graphically what has been presented at events like E3 by Ubisoft. Then someone found out some hidden settings in the file like ""E3_RandomGraphicSetting"" and it made the game a little bit better. Finally it has been a major burnt, and IIRC it was the game which started the ""Don't preorder"" trend /r/pcmasterrace tries to follow now.  Then came Assassin's Creed Unity, and it wasn't even like W:D which was playable: AC wasn't remotely playable on high-end computers at a standard 60fps, and not even close to recent games graphics. Even on consoles it was a bad game, with so much bugs it was ridiculous.  And let's not forget how Ubisoft treats PC gamers, especially the CEO with quotes along the line of ""PC gamers are all pirates, 70% don't buy our games and pirate them so we shouldn't bother to make them on PC"".  Finally, I used to love Ubisoft (great games / ideas) but they turned a bit too much in the cliche ""evil corporation only milking clients"". I do hope they learn from their mistakes and will return back to great finished games running well on consoles / mid-end PC and stop lying to everyone."

What about local multiplayer? You'd have to have several controllers for everybody, and even if you did it's still kind of a small screen. Is there a way to do this with PC gaming?"
trendingsubreddits,2r34x3,Tizaki,15,Sat Jan 3 04:57:16 2015 UTC,"There are several   Virtual machines (Microsoft Virtual PC, VMWare, Oracle VirtualBox). You set up a VM, clone it several times, and drag one to each individual monitor. I think you should be able to configure them to work with controllers or separate input devices like mice with little issue. Someone with a crappy PC can also connect into one of these and ""borrow"" the power from a large desktop (similar to in-home streaming with Steam). LAN parties. These are the biggest and most popular. Everyone would normally need their own PC, but once you plug together it's a blast. /r/pcmasterrace/wiki/languide is old, but it should explain some of this. SoftXpand (this is similar to virtual machines, but it somehow forces Windows to allow multiple users to log in on their own and each have their own separate simultaneous desktops/sound channels/mouse and keyboard operations. It costs money though. Splitscreen tools (http://steamcommunity.com/app/49520/discussions/0/864977025916708574/) Plain old multi-monitor, but you can only do this with non-mouse games AFAIK. You basically just plug in a monitor, extend the desktop, drag your emulator over once it's configured to use one of the many controllers plugged in, and click ""full screen"" (or just resize it a ton). It should stay on that monitor and leave the other session/user alone. This is an AWESOME tool for distracting children that keep bothering you when you just want to get stuff done. You just plug in a controller and monitor (with long cords) and set them up a little station 5 feet away and they'll have a blast."

trendingsubreddits,2r34x3,greenshrubbery,-24,Fri Jan 2 10:45:46 2015 UTC,"I'm so tired of the whole PC master race mentality. You people act like your promoting some noble cause, while all you really do is act like elitist docuhebags all over reddit. Don't tell me ""It's just a joke"" either, because it clearly not to a lot of the subscribers. I see this shit everywhere on reddit, and quite frankly it makes me embarrassed to be not just a PC gamer, but a gamer in general. You can't mention anything to do with consoles anywhere on reddit nowadays without a million annoying comments about how much better PC is. These comments even pop up on console gaming subreddits. Do you people just not realize how toxic your mindset is? The fact that PCMasterRace is one of the biggest gaming subreddits on this website makes me think that the gaming community still has a long way to go in terms of maturity."
trendingsubreddits,2r34x3,SpicyMcHaggis206,19,Fri Jan 2 09:25:03 2015 UTC,Anyone who is a douchebag about it isn't because they are a PC user. It's because they are a douchebag. It's a joke. It's satirical.
trendingsubreddits,2r34x3,ak474000,3,Fri Jan 2 16:25:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I've been upvoted there for saying good things about consoles. Because I wasn't trolling. I was having a conversation. The people who think its taken super seriously there are probably just assholes themselves.   If you're going to come onto a PC gaming sub and start talking about consoles, you better approach the subject right if you don't want to get attacked. I don't think that only applies to PCMR either."
trendingsubreddits,2r34x3,BT73,6,Sun Jan 4 04:12:17 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the toxicity you are seeing are either people who recently joined PCMR or are younger immature teenagers. They see the satirical posts, take them seriously, and then feel like they are on a ""personal crusade for GabeN"" because they finally feel like a part of something and want to impress the rest of PCMR.   It's no different than any other group with a very extreme and vocal minority. They go out to the corners or reddit acting like asshats while the rest of us are in /r/pcmasterrace circlejerking around a video card."
trendingsubreddits,2r34x3,ak474000,20,Sun Jan 4 06:25:54 2015 UTC,"The few never represent the many. The gaming community has always had a long way to go in terms of maturity. It is a hobby that is not taken seriously outside of some set groups and it is still an activity for ""children only."" As such, you will get that common childish vibe from the whole scene whether it be PC or console. We should not solely point fingers at one group or another. It is in our best interest to weed out the otherwise perfect garden together."
trendingsubreddits,2r34x3,totes_meta_bot,1 point,Sun Jan 4 07:54:20 2015 UTC,"While I generally agree with that sentiment, a large amount of the immaturity I have seen in the gaming community has come from the PC side recently. I am subscribed to all of the major console gaming subreddits(such as r/ps4 and r/xboxone) and, for the most part, these subreddits leave each other alone and just do their own thing. PCMasterRace is the only gaming subreddit that I see acting like this and attacking other people simply for having a preference."
trendingsubreddits,2r34x3,gaardyn,6,Fri Jan 2 17:33:05 2015 UTC,"It is a growing community lately so likely younger people who have not grasped the concept of ""tongue-in-cheek"" well so they kind of ruin the fun for everyone sadly.   I don't condone the PCMR CJ. I stay away from it and PCMR ins general does not like those who are being dick heads, but alas there will still be dick heads either way and it will only get worse as more younger and new people enter the whole PCMR realm not really thinking about their actions.   I will give it you, PC has been toxic, but the last time I played on my PS3 has not been pleasant to say the least. I am not willing to then go out and say that console gamers are toxic as a whole, because in reality we all have the capacity to be dicks. Anonymity will do that to people. Let off steam and not have to worry about the consequences of real life issues when doing something you normally would not.   I want to make it better for everyone though the PC sphere and whatever other platforms may come along the way if it is cloud based or still hardware based in our living rooms. We are all gamers at the end of the day. Let's make the community better for everyone."

Do you really expect someone who is a more casual gamer to spend time researching and then building a PC? Whatever your opinions on consoles are, it can't be argued that PCs are simpler to acquire, manage, and use than a console. Consoles are a convenience product, and because of this there will always be a market for them."

The BBC have since refused to apologise, which in my opinion is justified.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gear_controversies#Argentina"
trendingsubreddits,2qluq1,autowikibot,2,Sun Dec 28 23:56:56 2014 UTC,"Section 9. Argentina of article  Top Gear controversies:       In September and October 2014 the three presenters Clarkson, Hammond, May and a crew of 29 people were recording the Top Gear Christmas Special in Argentina featuring three cars—a Porsche 928 GT, a Lotus Esprit and a Ford Mustang Mach I. They had started in Bariloche on September 19  and travelled southward on the trans-Patagonian Route 40, about 1,000 miles (1,600 km). On October 2 they had arrived in Ushuaia, at the southern end of Tierra del Fuego. The plan was to film for three more days, and then to continue in Chile.

Presumably, they roll film 16 hours a day. That's 256 hours of film edited down to 1 hour.    Think about the job of editing that all together. Then add in the film from at least 2 cameras per car, plus leading and trailing vehicles for road shots, and at least 2 steadicams. 6 or more sources of video, plus several microphones.

trendingsubreddits,2qluq1,Magikarpeles,5,Mon Dec 29 00:18:59 2014 UTC,"They won't typically roll for the whole time, film is crazy expensive and going through film is even more expensive. Much of the events are planned, with some leeway for spontaneous filming. Even with the spontaneous stuff you usually have an idea when stuff will happen.  Camera crew and directors will hopefully add some time codes or notes with the footage as its taken to make it easier. The rushes (the day's raw footage) is usually delivered to an onsite editor(s) who busts through it looking for good bits. So a lot of the editing is done on the fly anyway, but yes, it is a fairly taxing (and well paid) job. Editors, graphics, and graders can easily get paid more per hour than producers, sometimes upwards of $1000 a day.

trendingsubreddits,2qluq1,Werner__Herzog,3,Mon Dec 29 15:29:02 2014 UTC,I think it has to with the fact that only the top five trending subreddits get listed.

On the table the man put  Things that happened in his mind.  What he wanted to do in life,  He put that there.  Those he loved, those he didn't love,  The man put them on the table too.  Three times three make nine:  The man put nine on the table.  He was next to the window next to the sky;  He reached out and placed on the table endlessness.  So many days he had wanted to drink a beer!  He put on the table the pouring of that beer.  He placed there his sleep and his wakefulness;  His hunger and his fullness he placed there.  Now that's what I call a table!  It didn't complain at all about the load.  It wobbled once or twice, then stood firm.  The man kept piling things on."

A good 'jerk subreddit' allows some people to better see the flaws in the original subreddit, and I've noticed a change in the submissions and activity. Plus, people have been pretty supportive and welcoming to new users. Most people understand that you have to start somewhere, crosleys aren't the end of the world, they're a good start at the least and most people are getting some common albums from christmas, but the excitement is understandable and in my mind is ok. Hell, I see 'Johnny Cash: live at folsom prison' all the time, but it was one of my first records and I still love to leave a comment on a post about it. Sure things can seem elitest, but my favorite thing about the subreddit is the post about really rare albums or really nice setups. It's understandable when you personally find a record that not easy to find and you've been looking everywhere for years, so you have to tell someone, make a post, and other people start talking about how great the album is. It was great when it happened to me."

trendingsubreddits,2q20gl,reddit,18,Mon Dec 22 09:23:13 2014 UTC,"To celebrate /r/pizza, why not make a few and post some pics?  Here's a great same day recipe:    Ingredients  8 ounces old dough or sourdough starter 10 1/2 ounces unbleached all-purpose flour 11 ounces unbleached bread flour or high-gluten flour 1 ounce spelt flour 3 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon instant yeast 1 3/4 cups cool water 1/8 cup extra virgin olive oil   Procedures   Combine all ingredients in a large metal bowl. Work with the paddle attachment of a stand mixer or by hand until flour absorbs all liquid, forms a coarse ball, and begins to strengthen, about 3 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes. Continue to work until soft, supple, and only slightly sticky, about 3 minutes. The dough should pass the windowpane test. You may have to incorporate more flour or water to achieve this texture, depending on the hydration of the old dough. Form dough into a ball by repeatedly folding in corners until surface tension develops. Oil a large bowl and roll ball of dough all over to coat with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature for 1 1/2 hours. Punch down dough, re-form into a ball, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until ready to use."

Here are some links to my personal favourite stories, to give you an idea of the sort of content we get.   The Mechanic (set in a Star Wars universe, with an awesome ending) Demi gods. This one's extremely long, but absolutely worth it. Might wanna take this one a little bit at a time if it's too long for one sitting. An evil necromancer in an online game An evil campaign... gone good? The Medusa, really poignant. Of Gay Marriage, Kings, and Democracy Another really, really long one, about A group of unsuspecting modern-day humans who enter a portal and find themselves stranded in a high-fantasy world. And of course, perhaps the most famous one, Sir Bearington (but also, it's origins).   But there are many, many more really good ones worth going through."

trendingsubreddits,2pvd3t,thebiggestandniggest,7,Sat Dec 20 11:48:59 2014 UTC,How is that fair?
trendingsubreddits,2pvd3t,gaardyn,4,Sat Dec 20 14:49:57 2014 UTC,"It justifies why people care about seeing the movie more than living conditions in North Korea. People don't normally see North Koreans suffering, so they don't care. But they were intent on seeing this movie, and Kim Jong Un is stopping them. That's why they care now."
trendingsubreddits,2pvd3t,thebiggestandniggest,2,Sat Dec 20 17:33:35 2014 UTC,"It doesn't justify it. Justify means ""show or prove to be right or reasonable"". There's nothing right or reasonable about people caring more about their ability to watch a movie than the living conditions of nearly twenty-five million people. All it does is demonstrate that most people are greedy assholes only concerned with their personal convenience."
trendingsubreddits,2pvd3t,gaardyn,3,Sat Dec 20 19:34:20 2014 UTC,"Yes, but ""to be fair"" means that he is explaining why the previous comment was not completely correct. The reason why people don't think about what's going on in North Korea is not that they don't care about North Koreans, but it does not affect them so they are not reminded of it. The fact that they are not allowed to watch this American movie does affect them and they are reminded constantly through media outlets like Reddit. That does not make it right to not care about North Koreans, but it does explain why. People care about what affects them. That is the difference between the phrase ""to be fair"", which just explains a statement that could give the wrong impression,  and the word ""fair"", which means ""just"" or ""righteous""."
trendingsubreddits,2pvd3t,thebiggestandniggest,-1,Sat Dec 20 19:42:52 2014 UTC,"""To be fair"" insinuates an injustice on the part of the party you're being fair about. There's nothing unjust about thinking that people that are more concerned with their own convenience than the well-being of other people are assholes."
trendingsubreddits,2pvd3t,thebiggestandniggest,3,Sat Dec 20 20:33:11 2014 UTC,"It's because their suffering has been going on for a while and it has not been brought to people's attention because we do not see the effects of it in our daily lives and the media has not been shoving it in our faces. On the other hand, theatres pulling a movie due to threats from North Korea is fresh news that affects those of us that actually looked forward to the movie. This is actually affecting our lives AND the media is all over it, so it's a conversation piece.  For example, how often do you think about the genocide of Tamils in Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan war? Rarely, if not at all? I do not blame you. It doesn't affect your life and the media doesn't drag your attention toward it. There is too much suffering in the world to care about everyone, so most people do not care about anyone outside of their own country. I do not think it is unreasonable for people to think of themselves more than others."
trendingsubreddits,2pvd3t,gaardyn,3,Sat Dec 20 20:52:56 2014 UTC,"I personally think it's reasonable that people in first-world countries care more about their entertainment than the well-being of people in other countries if they only care about which provides more benefit to their lives. Of course, it is not right."
trendingsubreddits,2pvd3t,thebiggestandniggest,-2,Sat Dec 20 21:07:43 2014 UTC,I have to disagree. There's nothing reasonable about being an asshole.
trendingsubreddits,2pvd3t,gaardyn,2,Sat Dec 20 20:36:05 2014 UTC,"Yes there is. There is greater benefit for us to not care about North Koreans if no one is going to pressure us. It is sensible to not do more then we are obligated to. Of course, it is immoral to not care."
trendingsubreddits,2pvd3t,thebiggestandniggest,-1,Sat Dec 20 20:51:02 2014 UTC,"I think we're simply arguing the semantics of ""reasonable"" at this point. I don't consider immoral actions to ever be reasonable."

I don't subscribe to it, but check in often for discussions on some of my favorite shows. Don't know anything about the moderation. The one thing I don't like about it is the amount of OTP/waifu/etc talk. It's just not for me.  /r/Sneakers is for sneakers, obviously. Looks like a good sub. Might ask them for advice now that I'm in the market for some new shoes. My running shoes are falling apart and, while good exercise, running in my steel toe boots is less than pleasant.  /r/GeologyPorn is awesome because rocks are awesome and geologists are awesome, though boring. I've never met a geologist who did anything but get drunk and talk enthusiastically about why a boring looking rock is super cool. I had a geologist friend in college who talked for nearly three hours after bringing back a rock collection she'd found at a flea market. One rock was pretty cool, and looked like a silver meteorite about 2"" thick. I couldn't tell limestone from sandstone, and all rocks are just ""rock"" to me."

trendingsubreddits,2pg9r6,I_want_hard_work,2,Wed Dec 17 01:19:51 2014 UTC,It's real.  I read a magazine interview with the creator a while ago.  The problem is that it's just the latest of the exact same promise we've been given for decades.  It just happens to be whoever has the sexiest ad campaign at the time gets the attention.
trendingsubreddits,2pg9r6,fuckingyouintheass,9,Wed Dec 17 04:35:09 2014 UTC,All I hear about /r/soylent (even the DIY varieties) is that is gives you terrible gas.
trendingsubreddits,2pg9r6,thapol,3,Tue Dec 16 12:25:52 2014 UTC,"The official version has had some issues which are pretty easily solved with some Beano or chlorophyll supplement.   That said, most of the DIY solutions and the other premade seller recipes haven't had nearly as big of an issue with gas as Rosa Lab's version. No idea why that's the case, but if you ever wanted to go about some domestic chemical warfare while getting a stupidly healthy (and relatively cheap for urbanites) diet, there's only a 4 to 6 month backorder for Rosa Lab's version."
trendingsubreddits,2pg9r6,wtfjen,4,Tue Dec 16 15:58:27 2014 UTC,"PSA: don't take Beano regularly. It works by disrupting your gut bacteria, which are healthy and essential to have."
trendingsubreddits,2pg9r6,thapol,3,Tue Dec 16 16:39:29 2014 UTC,"Taken from the horses mouth, so bag of salt in hand, but...   Beano contains an enzyme from a natural source (chlorophyll I'm assuming) (nope; alpha galactosidase) that works with your body's digestion. It breaks down the complex carbohydrates found in gassy foods into simpler, easily digestible sugars before they reach the colon, preventing gas before it starts.   Is this harsh on the gut bacteria? I couldn't find much on it at a quick glance."
trendingsubreddits,2pg9r6,Beowoof,2,Tue Dec 16 18:06:20 2014 UTC,"I technically don't know anything about this, but it sounds like it breaks down complex carbs before they reach your intestines, so your gut bacteria don't have anything to digest and die. You need gut bacteria to digest your food (unless you're always taking Beano, but I doubt that it replaces everything for you), so don't kill them. /u/wtfjen is saying not to take it regularly because you'll harm your gut bacteria, which you need."

Eliminating the current welfare system, reducing/eliminating minimum wage, taxing large purchases, etc. A little money saved here and there."
trendingsubreddits,2p8wt6,AirBlaze,1 point,Mon Dec 15 01:51:45 2014 UTC,"Where does the money for a ""basic income"" come from?   First off, as mentioned below, there would be savings from eliminating a number of social spending programs that will be unnecessary after Basic Income. After that, there are a lot of proposals, various taxes (income tax, VAT, carbon tax, land value tax, financial transaction tax) or a sovereign wealth fund, like in Alaska. Some people propose not raising taxes but just making lots of cuts to the budget in order to afford it (e.g. what once economist calls 'middle-class welfare', subsidies to business, defense spending).   What if everyone decides that they want to just live on basic income?    In practice they wouldn't. There's been pilot BI studies in the US and Canada which showed that the only people who reduced work hours were highschoolers and new mothers, in order to get more schooling and extend their maternity leave (i.e. to look after their children), which are both good things. In other studies around the world, work hours increased because people started their own businesses. There's also the issue of whether or not there's even enough jobs out there anyway, if not now then into the future as automation increases."
trendingsubreddits,2p8wt6,gameratron,22,Mon Dec 15 10:07:09 2014 UTC,"For anyone coming here from the front page interested in learning more about the idea of basic income and not knowing just where to start as far as reading goes, I suggest the following two articles as primers to the idea:   Why we should give free money to everyone Why Should We Support the Idea of an Unconditional Basic Income?   The first goes over a lot of evidence that exists for the idea in general, and the second goes over a lot of the evidence from the perspective of how it'll make our economy work better."
trendingsubreddits,2p8wt6,2noame,2,Sun Dec 14 17:32:48 2014 UTC,"Where do you get the money for that? If you print it then inflation would skyrocket, making basic income worthless. If you pay for it with taxes on the hyper-wealthy then you'd be circulating money that would otherwise not be floating around, which would also make inflation skyrocket.   It's a wonderful idea, but how do you do that to an entire country without wrecking the economy?"
trendingsubreddits,2p8wt6,Juz16,1 point,Mon Dec 15 06:24:01 2014 UTC,"I know it sounds like inflation is that simple of an equation, but it's not and there are a lot more variables involved which are actually very interesting to look at in greater depth.  Here's an article for that if you'd like to learn about inflation and basic income.  https://medium.com/basic-income/wouldnt-unconditional-basic-income-just-cause-massive-inflation-fe71d69f15e7  It's got 4 appendix articles attached as well, if you want to go really in depth by also reading each one."
trendingsubreddits,2p8wt6,2noame,1 point,Mon Dec 15 06:29:12 2014 UTC,"I'm just writing my thoughts as I read the articles, not really going to clean this up afterwards.  Money pumped into the economy through taxation and money pumped into banks through quantitative easing isn't very comparable. The former is distributed to various private firms that do government work, while the latter is usually hoarded by holding companies that run banks feeding off of the Federal Reserve system.   Seeing that providing basic income to some people increases ""entrepreneurship"" isn't really comparable to a situation where everyone has basic income.  I like the Alaska story.  Kuwait has had a lot of things effecting it's inflation-rate other than basic income since 2011...   The author's misunderstanding of economics is rather shocking in the milk analogy, if what he said was true then inflation would never happen. Prices don't instantly double, they change very slowly. Eventually, Store B would have to sell milk for $8 since the company that supplies them milk increased their prices. Here's my (satirical and equally terrible) counter-analogy, why would Farm A want to sell milk to Store B for $2 when they can sell it to Store A for $4?  The rest of the milk article is similarly economically unsound...   The reason there are so many vacant homes is because the price for a house is being artificially propped up by the government, if it was allowed to float freely then housing would be much cheaper.   Yes, technology is good.  Uhh, Google makes it's money from advertising. You can't provide free goods and services in a world with resource scarcity, that violates the basic pillars of economics.  I agree that software should be free.  3D printing isn't going to bring about a post-scarcity society, the resources you use to print things are scarce.  Also, the people who make software (music, CAD files, books, applications) need to eat, and therefore require resources to function.  Actually, you can have 3 Googles and 3 Facebook's.  I'm pretty sure this Paul Mason guy is a communist.  Comparing software prices to hardware prices is... Silly...  Yes, this guy is definitely a communist.  If you have a post-scarcity society then literally any ideology will work. It's not useful to say that over and over.  The Google theory is interesting, but I doubt it will get very far (for reasons similar to why Google Fiber isn't getting very far).  One of the main factors in the cost of a home is the price of the land the home is built on, cheap construction technology won't negate that.  Lottery winners usually get screwed...  Increasing the velocity of money increases inflation, not the other way around. Higher prices will screw over people on fixed incomes, like retirees and people surviving off of basic income.  The rate at which money is printed will not change unless there are DRASTIC measures taken to stop it.  Inflation is bad because people will jump off of the dollar to other currencies like the Euro, the Pound, silver, gold, or even bitcoin.  If you make it so the system causing inflation increases with inflation then things will get bad very quickly.  Did you write this article?"
trendingsubreddits,2p8wt6,Juz16,1 point,Mon Dec 15 07:41:46 2014 UTC,"Yes I did write it.  Look, some of the main reasons inflation is not a huge concern aside from basic income involving taxes and transfers and not printing new money is that velocity is way too low right now. We are also not operating at capacity. And yes it matters a lot what goods and services we are talking about because demand does not go up universally and supply is not unable to rise universally.  Yes, some prices will go up, and a new equilibrium will be attained, but at no point will it make the basic income itself worthless for certain goods and services to have a higher price until or even after the market adjusts.  We want greater money velocity. We want more people at the bottom spending more money because it drives the economy more than that money staying at the top.  We haven't even been able to attain our target inflation level through QE3 and our interest rates are near zero. We don't want to keep our rates this low.

trendingsubreddits,2p8wt6,Juz16,1 point,Mon Dec 15 17:22:57 2014 UTC,"I covered this in Exhibit D:  https://medium.com/basic-income/unearned-income-and-the-velocity-of-money-ddf9b19fcb8a  By any measure, velocity is hugely depressed.  This hurts the economy because it means people aren't exchanging dollars with a high enough frequency. We effectively have our brakes on, going uphill. It makes no sense to maintain this low of velocity out of fear of rampant inflation as a result of any increase in velocity.  Remember, we also want to raise interest rates from where they are now. By increasing velocity, by increasing inflation, to the target zone we actually want, or even a bit past it as economic stimulus, we can then raise interest rates to prevent inflation from going beyond where we want it.  Inflation is not a bogeyman. Not every step to greater inflation leads to Weimar Germany, just as not every Tylenol leads to liver failure, or every glass of wine leads to a fatal overdose of alcohol.  Moderation as in many things is the key here. Too little or too much can be as unhealthy for the economy as it is for the human body."
trendingsubreddits,2p8wt6,2noame,1 point,Mon Dec 15 17:48:23 2014 UTC,If you increase the velocity of money without putting the brakes on what we currently are printing then you'll devalue the dollar substantially.
trendingsubreddits,2p8wt6,Juz16,1 point,Mon Dec 15 18:32:39 2014 UTC,"But I'm not saying to not use any brakes whatsoever.  I'm saying that if we introduce a basic income, and transfer money from the top where it is doing comparatively little, to everyone else where it will do comparatively more (at a rate of about 3:1), the economy will grow and more people will have more money to spend. This is a good thing, especially for a consumer based economy like ours. We need more consumer spending across the entire economy and not concentrated at the top. Rich people can not run the entire economy by themselves. Each person would need to by thousands of cars and thousands of shirts and thousands of this and thousands of that. It's impossible.  As a result of more money now existing at the bottom and middle, velocity will increase, and some prices will go up. But also some prices will go down and some prices won't change at all. A LOT of factors are at play here.  All of this could raise inflation to at least where we want it. Right now inflation is less than where we want it. If inflation rises higher than where we want it, that's when we increase interest rates and/or further adjust tax rates.  Also, again, I am not for printing trillions of dollars and giving it to banks. Our money supply is big enough as it is. QE3 was a stupid idea and we should have instead just stimulated the economy by QEP (QE for the People) by just printing a smaller amount of money and giving it to people directly as stimulus checks. This would not have been a basic income, but it would have been a much wiser use of monetary policy.  And if we already had basic income in place, we wouldn't even had needed to print any money at all, and would already have a higher functioning more stable economy."
trendingsubreddits,2p8wt6,2noame,1 point,Mon Dec 15 18:45:55 2014 UTC,"Yeah, Medium is one of those outlets that will allow anyone to write a story. There's no real editorial oversight.  One thing I find interesting about the Basic Income people is that they never really have answers to the questions people ask, they just link to various articles, or say ""check our FAQ"". I feel like if you don't have a good answer to the most commonly posed questions, you probably don't have a good grasp on the economics behind it.  A lot of the case studies in their FAQs are not actually basic income: like Uganda was means tested, not universal, and Alaska, Kuwait, and Iran are redistributing wealth from oil specifically, which would not work for the US at large (due to private ownership of the means of production in our national oil industry). We've also seen how positive rights coupled with government mismanagement has led to crises in places like Venezuela.  I think their hearts are probably in the right place, but given the murky track record of massive wealth redistribution even on smaller scales, I'm skeptical."

trendingsubreddits,2p8wt6,Juz16,1 point,Mon Dec 15 17:23:49 2014 UTC,"There are many proposals, though the most fleshed out is a flat tax of 40-45% on income, with an untaxed basic income which in practice would be a progressive tax.  If there's a bunch more money in the economy, wouldn't that encourage people to set up businesses to capture that money, boosting the economy, particularly since BI encourages entrepreneurship? And wouldn't those extra businesses then compete with each other and thus keep prices down?"
trendingsubreddits,2p8wt6,gameratron,1 point,Mon Dec 15 09:58:55 2014 UTC,If there's a bunch more money in the economy then the price would of a dollar would collapse because the supply far outweighs the demand.

trendingsubreddits,2p8wt6,nlane515,2,Mon Dec 15 05:25:22 2014 UTC,"Squaring the circle:       Squaring the circle is a problem proposed by ancient geometers. It is the challenge of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge. More abstractly and more precisely, it may be taken to ask whether specified axioms of Euclidean geometry concerning the existence of lines and circles entail the existence of such a square.  In 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem which proves that pi (π) is a transcendental, rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients. It had been known for some decades before then that the construction would be impossible if pi were transcendental, but pi was not proven transcendental until 1882. Approximate squaring to any given non-perfect accuracy, in contrast, is possible in a finite number of steps, since there are rational numbers arbitrarily close to π.  The expression ""squaring the circle"" is sometimes used as a metaphor for trying to do the impossible.   The term quadrature of the circle is sometimes used synonymously or may refer to approximate or numerical methods for finding the area of a circle.

Now internalize the fact that that factor is different for everyone else and the concept of a ""fair minimal wage"" immediately becomes worthless  edit: looks like i went fairly pedantic and meandered there. Ok look - i have a dollar,you have a dollar, everyone has a dollar - that dollar is our birthright. what value does your dollar have to me? what is backing that dollar up as a unit of worth? what service is worth a dollar and not less? if someone said - these are the rules/values and everyone follows them and i'll shoot violators in the head so there, i'd know the value of my dollar. otherwise someone is gonna say one dollar is worth nothing, bring me two dollars and you'll be able to do nothing about it. simplest way i can put it. every edge case derives from that simple - your 1 dollar means nothing to me-it isn't worth food,clothing,shelter or any of the other things that ""basic income"" proponents like to spout as fundamental rights, i want more than what you currently have for what you want from me."

trendingsubreddits,2p5rsh,MikeyJayRaymond,1 point,Sat Dec 13 14:09:41 2014 UTC,Do you want that in a sort of gaming order or just an overall opinion of each?
trendingsubreddits,2p5rsh,God_of_Illiteracy,2,Sat Dec 13 15:54:10 2014 UTC,Why not both?!
trendingsubreddits,2p5rsh,MikeyJayRaymond,6,Sun Dec 14 01:00:57 2014 UTC,"Ranking order?  XBO = PC = WiiU = PS4  I honestly believe that. There's literally a bonus to all the platforms.   Time on each?  XBO > PS4 > PC > WiiU  Overall Attitude  Xbox One vs. PS4  We'll start with what I like about Xbox, then things I don't like, and do the same for PS4.  Most of my gamers buddies in the real world play on Xbox and have for the majority of their lives. Former PS2/PS3 fanboy here as well. I've become addicted to the system which surrounds it. From achievements, to the usefulness of the Kinest. I appreciate the dedication they've put into it bringing monthly updates to the system  without missing a beat. Snap mode, ugh! I use it all the time!  There's also something about the Xbox One controller I just can't get over. It feels so natural in my hands. Now, don't get me wrong, the build of both the Xbox One and PS4 controller at the start was horrendous. My first controller on XBO creaked like no tomorrow. My PS4 controller had the thumbsticks rub off. Both had their own homebrew fixes that ended up helping the issue down the road and both have also solved this with later builds I believe (unsure if solved on PS4. Haven't bought another controller).  I also enjoy the exclusives a bit better on Xbox. I've always enjoyed Halo and Sunset Overdrive was something very unique that I've never quite seen done before. In a world where games feel like they're all alike, it was a nice change of pace. I also loved me some Titanfall. As a former competitive player who's gone to MLG events for Halo and was also the #1 FFA player in Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Titanfall felt super competitive to me. Something I hadn't felt in a while.  I also tried both consoles racing franchises. The ones delivered so far have been heavily in Xbox's favor. Driveclub feels like a disaster to me and was incredibly hard to play. The Crew is the only game worse. I do however believe Gran Turismo will remedy this and it will stand right next to Forza as one of the best racers. For now though, the title undoubtedly goes to Microsoft here.  Other exclusives I'm excited for? Quantum Break. Alan Wake was in my top 5 games last gen. Definitely can't wait for more Remedy.  Now, PS4. I know at this point it seems like, ""Oh heck! What the hell does this guy like about PS4? Effin' MS fanboy 4 L1f3."" I can ssure you I love the PS4 as well.   Currently I play my multiplats on Xbox One because I enjoy the online more so there as well as having friends to play with. 900p vs. 1080p doesn't matter nearly as much as you would think it would. Most games play the same as it is now. And if I did truly care I'd just pop it on my PC which puts both to shame.  Still think I hate PS4? Damn no. Naughty Dog. I drool like a dog whenever I hear more about Uncharted 4. I cannot wait for that game! After playing The Last of Us: Remastered, I'm hoping to God for more Naughty Dog. The Last of Us has been my favorite game EVER made. Hands down the best ending to a game I've ever touched.  Now, the mechanics weren't ground breaking or anything. They were as good as they come though. Nothing felt off about them. What sold it to me was the story. There was not a single dull moment in that entire game. I cannot remember a game that's ever done that to me since playing Alan Wake or Red Dead Redemption.  The Vita is only the icing on the cake to me. Although mine broke (for now), it was incredibly useful to get up and go where I had good signal and could still play from home. Heck, at work I was getting 140 down!  Other exclusives? Infamous is always a glorious pretty color that I can't stop looking at, and I'm very much looking forward to UC4 as well as The Order.  Wii U  Mario Kart, Super Smash Bros, Mario, Luigi, Zelda. I'm done.  PC  I play tons of MMOs, when I'm in the mood. WoW always hooks me for a month out of the year. Then there's all the early access games that I actually love! 7 Days To Die is something I always love coming back to, not to mention Minecraft. Insurgency really kills it as well for my competitive side again. Feels so refreshing like Counter-Strike does. (I own like... 300+ games?)  I know I said far more about the consoles, but that's because everyone know about what a PC can do. If you can afford it and all your friends are there, it's the better option. You'll just have to upgrade again in 4 yearsish."

trendingsubreddits,2p5rsh,jimmycarr1,1 point,Sat Dec 13 15:17:30 2014 UTC,"Travelling (even solo) is a lot safer than most people imagine, depending on where you are going to. If you are worried about your safety then hop on to /r/solotravel and ask other solo female travellers where they personally felt comfortable.  A lot of major European capital cities for example, are the sort of places you can walk around on your own (especially in daylight) and not be bothered by anyone at all.  Maybe somewhere like Rome would be a good start, or London if you are worried about language barriers.  Don't let a small (and to be honest, quite irrational) fear stop you from seeing the world."

trendingsubreddits,2ojkke,rileyrulesu,9,Sun Dec 7 18:46:04 2014 UTC,"/r/KitchenConfidential is for people that are in the industry. It is mostly bitching, but there is some quality content in there at times.  If you want to ask about lasagne, you might be looking for /r/Cooking or /r/AskCulinary.  For the most part, each one of these subreddits opinions of the others is negative, so take you time exploring each one and find out which one works for you. Don't listen to what other people say about them, including the rant I'm going to make.  In my opinion, there is sometimes equally bad advice in /r/AskCulinary and /r/Cooking, although both will pretend like the other one sucks more. Also, in my experience bad advice is more discouraged in /r/AskCulinary, both by downvoting and by replies. In /r/Cooking, plenty of bad advice gets upvoted.  /r/AskCulinary is more on-topic. /r/Cooking tends to repeat the same questions over and over. What's the best book for learning how to cook? Queue the same books getting mentioned that did yesterday. And the day before. Also, I don't really cook but I want to do something impressive for my S.O., so I'm going to tell you nothing about their preferences but instead ask how to do something impressive for them.  Yes, I've spent too much time in these subreddits and am annoyed by some of their rubbish. But they're worth visiting."

trendingsubreddits,2o11vm,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Dec 2 20:59:00 2014 UTC,"Deductive reasoning:       Deductive reasoning, also deductive logic or logical deduction or, informally, ""top-down"" logic,  is the process of reasoning from one or more statements (premises) to reach a logically certain conclusion.   Deductive reasoning links premises with conclusions. If all premises are true, the terms are clear, and the rules of deductive logic are followed, then the conclusion reached is necessarily true.  Deductive reasoning (top-down logic) contrasts with inductive reasoning (bottom-up logic) in the following way: In deductive reasoning, a conclusion is reached reductively by applying general rules that hold over the entirety of a closed domain of discourse, narrowing the range under consideration until only the conclusion is left. In inductive reasoning, the conclusion is reached by generalizing or extrapolating from initial information. As a result, induction can be used even in an open domain, one where there is epistemic uncertainty. Note, however, that the inductive reasoning mentioned here is not the same as induction used in mathematical proofs – mathematical induction is actually a form of deductive reasoning.

trendingsubreddits,2nngqj,gaardyn,2,Sat Nov 29 05:55:27 2014 UTC,"Dating is the only real positive thing about being tall. It's hard to find cheap well-fit clothing, harder to find affordable vehicles that we can fit into, public transit is painful due to a lack of leg room/head room, most of Europe/New England was built pre-1900 and thus doorways and ceilings are dangerously low. I live with a concussion more so than not, bad knees and a sore back. The skinnier versions of us tall folks are at a higher risk of having collapsed lungs.  It's probably better to be shorter than taller in this world. You can get a stool to grab stuff off the top shelf but you can't shorten your legs to fit in a car."

We have received input from the community and have come up with a very sounds method of drawing that fully eliminates the chances of corruption. In a nutshell, we have a script that exports a list of the comments submitted and verifies that each user has posted once. We embed the said list's hash in bitcoin blockchain as a proof of existence and then use the hash of the sixth block mined after the time of putting the list up as a seed for Python's pseduorandom number generator.   This can be easily verified by the community because we publish the list and they can compare its hash with the one embedded in the blockchain. They can also use the sixth block's hash to generate the random winner on  their machine and verify that it is indeed the one we announced."
trendingsubreddits,2nk9cj,minlite,4,Thu Nov 27 20:34:20 2014 UTC,Using a better defined random number generator might be a good idea -> as far as I know Python gives no guerantee that the built-in RNG behaves the same in different versions

trendingsubreddits,2nk9cj,olithraz,7,Thu Nov 27 09:26:24 2014 UTC,It's called InquisitionSliders because it's a community where you can post your sliders from Character Creation in the Game Dragon Age : Inquisition since the game itself does not offer a more easy way to share character faces as it is.

Survivor Zero was based on a community desire for a truly immersive Zombie Survival game.

What I mean is that at this point the subreddit is too small to filter out the bad responses. Most of the threads you click will have only a couple of answers and a lot of them are lame, but after a while a good joke flows to the top. I think that'll happen faster with more people chiming in. Redditors love to be the wittiest of the bunch, in this case that's going to be a good thing."

trendingsubreddits,2llit1,pear1jamten,2,Sat Nov 8 13:12:53 2014 UTC,"The way I (and the consensus among the mods and the users, whenever this comes up as a topic of discussion) is that a delta ought to be awarded whenever a view is changed, whoever changes it (except OP of the thread, as that encourages soapboxing).   Some people believe a semantic change to be a great change, while others do not.   We do not police what does and doesn't constitute a change in view and expect people to act in good faith.   On a more specific note - semantics and technicalities are often as much a part of the larger point as the ""spirit"" of the view.   What is it that they say? The devil is in the details?"

trendingsubreddits,2llit1,Lawsoffire,10,Fri Nov 7 21:39:51 2014 UTC,The unfortunate issue with it is and always will be that you can't make sure that OPs are serious about having their views changed. You take the good threads as they come.
trendingsubreddits,2llit1,CokeTastesGood39,1 point,Fri Nov 7 21:59:29 2014 UTC,"I followed it for a while, but I got frustrated with it. Too often it's the case that OP will make a post that has a faulty premise or flat-out doesn't make sense. People will comment asking for clarification or calling OP out, but OP never posts any replies (and no one even knows whether OP is even monitoring the thread at all). The comments then devolve into people arguing over speculating about what OP might have meant in their nonsensical belief.  I gave up on it after a couple weeks :("

trendingsubreddits,2knrrb,reddit,115,Wed Oct 29 09:17:28 2014 UTC,Polandball?  RedditAdmins wanna get banned!
trendingsubreddits,2knrrb,DisturbedDizzy,106,Wed Oct 29 09:34:24 2014 UTC,"I'm just going to copy+paste what I wrote the last time we were trending, to prevent people from freaking out for no good reason:    Eh, it's gonna happen from time to time. That's the price we gotta pay to still be featured on /all, which we actually would prefer to be.  We have never wanted zero growth in the subreddit, and we are glad that it continues to be popular. It's a good subreddit, it should be popular. Our goal has rather always been to try to keep the growth at a manageable level, to avoid an overall decrease in quality (that always happens when you get a massive influx of people in a short period of time). Too many subreddits have gone to hell from growing too fast in too short of a time span; every community has it's own culture and it's own personality, and that can be turned upside down quickly if you're not careful.  Case in point, ours is a subreddit dedicated to crude jokes about national stereotypes. What usually happens when we get a huge influx of new subscribers, is that we get people who will cheerfully laugh at jokes about other countries, but instantly turn around and get angry about comics featuring their country, write long humorless walls of text describing in minute detail why the comic is factually incorrect, start fights in our comment sections, and generally bring a wave of negativity with them.  It takes a while for people to understand the nature of the sub, to understand that no punches are pulled there, and to see that everyone gets it equally.  That's the main reason why we try to avoid being in the spotlight to much. It's not that we're trying to have some sort of ""secret club"", far from it. We want to grow. We believe in the idea of polandball, we love these comics, and we want other people to love them as well. We simply want to grow the right way, so that the subreddit can continue to be a high-quality place that our long-time subscribers can still feel at home in.  It might come across as too strict for some people, but that's the way we've run the subreddit for a long time now, and we think we're better off for it. We mod hard, we have rules and we do enforce them, and we try to protect the special place we've managed to build there. But we do welcome new people with open arms. Just bring with you a light-hearted mood, some thick skin, and a willingness to both dish it out and take it, and you might just come to love it as much as we do.  tl;dr: Read the sidebar, browse the archives and read some comics to get a feel for the place, and expect strict moderation. And always remember: Sit up straight, eat your vegetables, and don't take polandball seriously.  And of course: Get some country flair from our sidebar, so that we can insult you based on your nationality."

trendingsubreddits,2knrrb,DickRhino,7,Wed Oct 29 12:33:13 2014 UTC,"You make it sound like it's easy to just ""heavily moderate"" the comment sections.  The mods on Polandball do a very good job, actually. They make an active effort to be in the comments sections - and not just to mod, but to join in with discussion.  Mods aren't gods, mate."
trendingsubreddits,2knrrb,totes_meta_bot,-25,Wed Oct 29 20:33:24 2014 UTC,"It's not that we're trying to have some sort of ""secret club""   Yeah, it is. The correct thing to do is moderate comments. The way you do it now makes it seem like you are a secret society. The audition-for-posts idea is a good start.  You banned me for posting a rant about the subreddit in a completely different subreddit."
trendingsubreddits,2knrrb,ForgingIron,26,Wed Oct 29 20:52:51 2014 UTC,"You were banned for this comment, where you were practically challenging us to ban you. It honestly shouldn't have come a surprise when we complied with your request and gave you the ban you so wanted to fuel your righteous indignation. Congratulations, you managed to become a martyr for the cause. Well done.  But to answer your main point, we do moderate comments, probably more so than most other subreddits do. I would wager that the mod team of /r/polandball is among the most active and hard-working out of any team of moderators on this entire site, including practically every default subreddit as well. That's not a problem though, we enjoy working hard for the subreddit.  ...There seems to be this belief that moderators are omnipotent beings who have complete control over what happens in a subreddit. It's like a mantra, that all you have to do is ""get more moderators"" and ""moderate more"" and somehow all problems will magically be resolved. That doesn't take into account the community, all our subscribers, which is an organic being that grows and evolves by itself.  We care about the state of our comment sections, and we treasure the fact that despite the nature of the sub, being crude satire about national stereotypes, it's one of the more positive, lighthearted and welcoming subreddits out there. Everyone gets insulted, and everyone laughs it off. It's actually quite cathartic in a way.  However, new people generally don't understand the culture of the sub. They get angry, they take it personally when someone jokes about their country, they start fights and attack the posters, claiming that their specific country should be off-limits (while gleefully laughing at other counties). It's always the same story: when we have a huge influx of new subscribers, it always leads to a period of extreme negativity and massive flame wars in our comment sections. Honestly, that is something we would rather do without.  We're not trying to be a ""secret club"". We don't want to be a secret club. What we want is to have a subreddit that stays a positive, welcoming and inclusive place despite it's size."

Yes, I taunted you. I didn't mean it in a ""come at me bro"" sort of way, I meant it to show how ridiculous the rule was. Maybe you should create a system where only approved submitters can comment?

trendingsubreddits,2knrrb,tomutwit,19,Wed Oct 29 14:25:36 2014 UTC,"No, but this is the origin of the popularity of it. Polandball comics have been around since September of 2009, but were almost completely unknown until 2013. For the first two years of it's existence /r/polandball had less than 1000 subscribers, and it's not until somewhere around a year and a half ago that it kinda exploded, and it did so here.  We're still the place that produces 99% of all polandball OC. Practically every other place where ""polandball comics are shared and discussed"" just takes their content from us and reposts it. We don't just ""share"" polandball comics, we're  the ones who actually make them. Yes, I do think that sets us apart."

The people who get mad over a comic insulting their country aren't welcome because it's not a serious sub, it's one that revolves around fundamental stereotypes and jokes about said countries.,  personally people who can't take a joke about their country don't belong on a a sub where people make jokes about countries."

trendingsubreddits,2joodd,shwwmy,18,Sun Oct 19 16:48:42 2014 UTC,"it's because you're getting your opinions from separate groups, just like any time someone comments on how ""reddit"" disagrees with ""reddit.""  Is it so hard to believe that the anti-smokers and the pro-druggies are actually different people?  Reddit isn't a person.  Stop talking about a website like it has opinions."
trendingsubreddits,2joodd,maccabeus,7,Sun Oct 19 18:39:44 2014 UTC,"You think it's not possible for a site to not have commonly held opinions between its frequents? I hardly ever see people go ""Germany isn't a person!"" when someone says that Nazi Germany hated Soviet Russia, why does this happen when someone says the same about Reddit's stance on something?  The majority of Reddit seems to love shitting on smokers. The majority represents the state or site or whatever else, that's how things work. Obviously I don't think 100% of Reddit does, after all I obviously don't shit on smokers."
trendingsubreddits,2joodd,shwwmy,9,Sun Oct 19 18:48:20 2014 UTC,"Just to work within your analogy, nobody would argue that Nazi Germany had negative feelings towards Russia.  What you said however, was more accurately translated as ""I never understood why Americans shit on Obama even though they elected him.""  Obviously the answer is that different groups are responsible for different positions.  The majority of reddit absolutely is anti-smoking, but that majority does not prevent the other side from having a voice. When you refer to the opinions ""of Reddit"" simply based on the majority, you make it sound like a single entity with a schizophrenic personality, instead of a diverse group with very varied opinions."

Part drugs arent just ""yeah we're cool kids cus we do drugs!!""  And i imagine that subreddits for hard drugs like heroin is in kinda the same light, I mean im sure plenty of people love heroin amd you do get somewhat ""functional"" users, but I imagine that it also works as a kind of support group for addicts."

trendingsubreddits,2joodd,shwwmy,3,Sun Oct 19 21:11:37 2014 UTC,"I meant in the sense that theyre leisure activities. And from my experience in the drug world, only teenagers who have just discovered party drugs do it to look cool. After a few tries, it turns into just enjoying it.

The puzzles go from place to place and nobody knows the purpose of it or what happens with anyone who solves the puzzles. Some of the puzzles even involved real life places. What's even more strange is that the real life puzzles range from spain to the US to Russia to China and nobody knows who creates these worldwide puzzles (except that their name is Cicada 3301). Some people believe it's a recruitement tool for the FBi or CIA, others think it's a recruitement tool for some hackergroup. There is a new puzzle going on right now. A lot of hacker forums on the Darkweb talk about them, trying to decrypt them. Sometimes Cicada 3301 even drops some clues through books (i.e. ''the next clue can be found on page 3 of the Illiad'') or music lyrics.  oh and here is the Wikipedia page on them:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada_3301  Oh and a Cicada is this:  http://media.salon.com/2013/05/cicada2.jpg  The Cicada is their symbol"

The problem with Reddit's larger, main dieting community is that men, due to their larger statures, can eat more and still lose weight, since their body just naturally burns more.

Thanks to that subreddit, I've found ways to make 1200 plenty.  Some days if I feel hungry still, I eat more.  But for the most part, 1200 has been plenty for me.  And while ACSM recommends certain calorie amounts, keep in mind it's simply a recommendation.  Everyone can determine from experience if something will work for them.  If someone starts trying to eat 1200 calories a day, they will be able to tell if it will work or not.  If not, take it up 100 calories, and repeat until you find your comfortable minimum.

I realize r/1200isplenty may not be fundamentally pro-ana, but by promoting it, you are perpetuating the mindset that fuels eating disorders. I would hope the people spreading this don't realize how damaging these sites are. I hope you don't understand the way someone who has had or has an eating disorder reacts to the calorie counting worship these sites thrive on, because if you do understand it and you are simply ignoring it, then you are a cruel person with no regard for anyone else's feelings. Go ahead and call me a social justice warrior. Make my day. But eating disorder propaganda has become way too prominent in society, and it can not be ignored. I request that you remove this subreddit from the front page, as it could negatively impact people who have struggled with eating disorders."

I hope you don't understand the way someone who has had or has an eating disorder reacts to the calorie counting worship these sites thrive on   So, we should stop doing and discussing something that helps us to be healthy, because there are people out there who take it to an extreme?  That's not the way it works.  Our community is very self-moderating, because our subscribers know we don't tolerate pro-ana philosophies.  Posts bragging about super low caloric intake get buried and are not at all encouraged.  They often inspire discussion that regularly reminds readers to make sure they're eating enough.  So, please climb down off your high horse, do a little research, and learn a few things about those on the other end of the spectrum, whose eating disorders cause them to be overweight, unhealthy and miserable.

trendingsubreddits,2jedgw,whyamisointeresting,1 point,Fri Oct 17 03:06:37 2014 UTC,"I'm not contesting that obesity and its negative effects have become too prevalent in society. The problem is when people use the ""obesity epidemic"" as an excuse to make people ashamed of their bodies. Yes, people who are overweight or obese should absolutely lose weight. Yes, it is unhealthy for them to be comfortable in their bodies. But when you advertise something like this, it's not only obese or overweight people who see it: it's all of Reddit, and you have no idea who is on Reddit or what their body image struggles are. You can be underweight or even be a healthy weight and still be unhealthy and miserable."
trendingsubreddits,2jedgw,AudgieD,1 point,Sat Oct 18 18:48:02 2014 UTC,You have no idea what you're talking about.  Nothing about our sub makes people feel ashamed of their bodies.  We don't even talk about our bodies.  We talk about food.  You're really making yourself sound ridiculous.  Move on.

Whether they focus too much on calorie counting to the point of fetishizing control is another issue, but it isn't fair to attack them for a name. The sub is no different than the dietary portion of /r/loseit."
trendingsubreddits,2jedgw,whyamisointeresting,0,Fri Oct 17 04:03:38 2014 UTC,"The difference is that I don't see anyone advertising the dietary portion of r/loseit to ALL of reddit. Why? Because not all of Reddit needs to lose weight, because not all PEOPLE need to lose weight. The problem with marketing schemes like this is that they get through loud and clear to the wrong people. Someone who weighs 300 lbs and is browsing Reddit can see that r/1200isplenty is trending and will probably just laugh it off. An adolescent girl who weighs 90 lbs and is browsing Reddit will see this and think, ""Look at all these people who are eating less than me. Look at how fat I am. I need to lose weight."" You should at least feel some sense of shame for potentially sending this life-damaging message."

Second, that sub is not responsible for what people do with it anymore than the numerous ""hot models"" subs should be blamed for promoting unhealthy body image. The sub is not pro-ana- it's a place for people who do maintain restricted calories (1200 or higher) to commiserate. I routinely see people with higher than 1200 daily intake, and the overall message about maximizing nutrition within a smaller intake is a good one.  It does not promote inherently unhealthy behaviors anymore than /r/fitness promotes ""bigorexia"". What people use the info for is their business. Resources for people trying to healthfully lose weight should not be restricted because they have the capacity to be misused."

trendingsubreddits,2jedgw,jtierney50,5,Thu Oct 16 12:57:05 2014 UTC,The first rule on /r/IDontWorkHereLady is that it doesn't have to be about women. It could have been /r/IDontWorkHereSir and had the same effect.

And in any case, the subs aren't as black and white as you say they are. /r/DadReflexes can feature Dads that have good or bad reflexes, although they do tend to be good. and /r/IDontWorkHereLady does have content featuring dumb people of both genders, but yes, mainly women. Do you have a point? A little bit. But it's not black and white enough to warrant complaining about.    TL;DR: People of both genders can and are smart, awesome, irritating, and dumb."

Where as /r/Askhistorians provides a serious subreddit for history, We provide a serious subreddit to discuss the latest North Korea.   We split from /r/WorldNews during the flare up in tensions in the spring of 2013 after every thread on North Korea became inundated with the /r/Pyongyang circlejerk and other silliness.   We aim to provide the one place on Reddit where Norh Korea can be discussed as a serious issue.  In order to foster discussion We remove the many creative and original jokes that you expect from your fellow Redditors.   The ""serious"" format of our subreddit has allowed us to host AMAs with:    Sokeel Park-  Director of Research and Strategy for the human rights group Liberty in North Korea Felix Abt- a Swiss businessman working on joint business ventures between the Norh Korean government and foreign companies. Dr. Andrei Lankov - Professor and author of many books on North Korean history and its economy.   We are currently gearing to hold our second annual fund raiser for Liberty in North Korea. LiNK not only assists refugees escape through their underground railrod through East Asia  but also helps them start a new life in South Korea. Last year We raised almost $3,000 surpassing the needed $2400 to assist in the rescue and resettlement of a North Korea refugee.

trendingsubreddits,2iqo18,dsiOneBAN2,13,Thu Oct 9 14:12:59 2014 UTC,"WebM video (what Gfycat uses) is far, far superior to GIF.   The format itself is comparable to the H.264 codec, which is what powers many video formats nowadays (YouTube, Bluray, etc), but is free open source software (FOSS) and is designed around high quality and small file sizes. What makes it a direct competitor to GIFs is that you can leave out the audio track in a WebM video and fairly easily tell the WebM player to loop endlessly, once the hallmark of GIFs. Combine this with compression technology from 2009 as opposed to 1987, and it's unarguably better.  If you need any convincing, take a look at this Gfycat link on the site itself.

""Oh Dear diner is laid out a lot like the R.R. Diner"" Reference 2. ""A secret society that protects the town"" Reference 3.   You got me on the idea of a town where ""Weird things"" happen, but twin peaks doesn't have shadow people, a story based on a writer, a giant lake with a house that disappears, a theme centered around light, etc etc.  Yes, Alan Wake's development team borrowed one or two aspects of Twin Peaks as inspiration, but I would hardly call it ""Twin Peaks"" the game."

Therion is widely regarded as the band which pioneered the genre, starting in the mid-90's. Here are two of their best songs: Schwarzalbenheim and Blood of Kingu.

trendingsubreddits,2icb3k,starburstempire,14,Sun Oct 5 07:52:16 2014 UTC,"The subreddit I moderate trended a while ago with only 4k subscribers. A crosspost to /r/games with 500-600 upvotes is what caused it. You can see our traffic stats from around the time it happened. August 30th is the day the post was made to /r/games, September 1st is the day we were featured on /r/trendingsubreddits. I suspect the algorithm to be considered trending relies heavily on pageviews. So if a subreddit is mentioned in an askreddit thread and not many people subscribe but the subreddit is still viewed a lot, I think it's still possible for the subreddit to still trend. This is only a theory based on what I've seen, though. And before anyone says it; we didn't participate in any malpractice to have our subreddit featured here."

We spent the last year turning into a more research-based subreddit.   We Now feature Academic Journal Article days (once a quarter), A flair system for users who have at least a master's in economics, and are prepared to discuss the published econ research in detail, and the provision of RSS feeds coming from various high level sources of of academic empirical research (NBER, LSE, various central banks).  What all of that means is that over the last year, /r/economics' content and discussion have become a lot more academic and research-based in nature. People can still have  this opinion or that, but they generally need to be able to cite published research or relevant figures in order to maintain cred for their POVs. Also, we don't allow personal attacks, so things stay more academic.   Our subscriber base has grown as a result, and our mod-team frequently receives praise over our new academic standards now."

trendingsubreddits,2i9dky,thevelarfricative,2,Sat Oct 4 15:07:16 2014 UTC,"Austrian School:       The Austrian School is a school of economic thought that is based on methodological individualism.     It originated in late-19th and early-20th century Vienna with the work of Carl Menger, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, Friedrich von Wieser, and others.  Current-day economists working in this tradition are located in many different countries, but their work is referred to as Austrian economics.  Among the theoretical contributions of the early years of the Austrian School are the subjective theory of value, marginalism in price theory, and the formulation of the economic calculation problem, each of which has become an accepted part of mainstream economics.   Many economists are critical of the current-day Austrian School and consider its rejection of econometrics and aggregate macroeconomic analysis to be outside of mainstream economic theory, or ""heterodox.""     Austrians are likewise critical of mainstream economics.  Although the Austrian School has been considered heterodox since the late 1930s, it began to attract renewed academic and public interest starting in the 1970s.

There's an overt rejection of empirical methodology, and overt (one-sided) rivalry with the Keynesian school of econ (as opposed to any other mainstream school), and a tendency to blame all economic problems on central banking, all of which causes a lot of tension across numerous subreddits, facebook pages, forums, and the internet in general."

trendingsubreddits,2i9dky,thevelarfricative,7,Sun Oct 5 01:34:33 2014 UTC,"It means that the entirety of Austrian Business Cycle Theory is a load of horseshit with less empirical validity than my theory arguing that business cycles are caused by goblin magic, written in my own excrement. The Austrian Business Cycle Theory is a morality fairy tale, a bedtime story told to white male teen nerds about the goodness of gold and the evil of the Big, Bad Fed, who will debase your currency and cause all moral hazard and malinvestment. It's less a theory than a compelling story for people who have never heard of Confirmation Bias and have never looked at any economic data from the Gold Standard era.  Absolutely no academic economists of any worth are Austrians. Not even Chicago School/Supply-side Neoclassical economists like Austrians.   Literally the only place where Austrian economics is taken seriously is on the internet, because Austrian/libertarian think tanks funded by corporations like Koch Industries are able to make popular videos like the ""Econ Rap Battle"" series and podcasts like EconTalk to preach the ideas of Hayek, Mises, and Rothbard without criticism. That and professional morons like Ron and Rand Paul believe in it."

trendingsubreddits,2i2ooy,Archaic44,2,Thu Oct 2 14:06:35 2014 UTC,"Such a vague name for a subreddit. Why can't they just put on the side bar ""Exercise goals""."
trendingsubreddits,2i2ooy,uninvitedthirteenth,4,Thu Oct 2 17:22:16 2014 UTC,"We support people with any type of goals, including exercise or fitness or weight loss, but not exclusively so.

trendingsubreddits,2i2ooy,graffit0,-1,Fri Oct 3 06:25:27 2014 UTC,r/ebola is definitely my new favorite subreddit.
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,reddit,5,Wed Oct 1 07:39:54 2014 UTC,"Stereoscopic pictures are really cool, I feel bad for people who can't get them to work."
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,banned_accounts,3,Wed Oct 1 12:59:49 2014 UTC,"Thanks, will you teach me?"
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,blacklodgebaby,3,Wed Oct 1 13:42:47 2014 UTC,"Cross your eyes until the pictures line up, when they do it's really just a case of waiting for your eyes to snap into focus. It eventually becomes super easy. Hi, I'm one of the mods from /r/crossview for anyone else who comes into the chat and has questions."
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,GaussWanker,1 point,Wed Oct 1 14:30:25 2014 UTC,I understand what crossing my eyes means. But my brain doesn't. Is there a trick?
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,blacklodgebaby,1 point,Wed Oct 1 14:57:51 2014 UTC,"You could do the ol' focus on your finger, then bring it closer to your face trick- then uncross slowly to get the right seperation."
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,GaussWanker,1 point,Wed Oct 1 15:07:47 2014 UTC,"Couple of questions:  1) Is the picture meant to fill your entire field of view?  2) Is each half picture meant to fill the field of view of each eye?  3) If I were to take each half picture and plug them separately into an Oculus Rift, would it work in the same way or different to how your method works or would it not work at all?  By ""work"" I mean create a sense of depth.  Thanks!"
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,WolfgangSho,2,Wed Oct 1 21:17:40 2014 UTC,"1) No, ideally it should be as big as you can make it, but small enough that you can go crosseyed enough to line up the pictures without it hurting, and without losing too much detail from moving away from the screen. 2) No. It's like looking at an image on your screen but in 3d. You wouldn't stick your face that close to your monitor. 3) Perhaps. It'd work for a still image I assume- I don't know if there's any special mapping they do for their screens or whether you could just have a pair of images. You'd have to switch around which way around the pictures are from the crossview, since crossed though."
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,GaussWanker,1 point,Wed Oct 1 21:20:35 2014 UTC,"Ah.. I think I'm completely misunderstanding the process. Thanks for the answers, its definitely cleared things up for me.  Wish me luck! :)  Ohh, one final question. Will the percieved  depth be ""away"" from me, like Red/Blue 3D films, or ""towards"" me, like IMAX?"
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,WolfgangSho,2,Wed Oct 1 21:32:35 2014 UTC,"As I've seen it, depends on how the picture is aligned- people tend to map the closest object onto the same physical space, meaning everything is backwards from that. But if things're lined up differently you can have forwards and backwards."
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,GaussWanker,1 point,Wed Oct 1 21:39:02 2014 UTC,"Does that mean if you change what you use as your mapping point, you can ""move"" in the scene?"
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,WolfgangSho,2,Wed Oct 1 21:46:10 2014 UTC,"hmmm. Thinking about it more, actually probably not- it's be the equivalent of moving the perspectives with respect to each other- that'd just make things more hyper (pinched) I think. I'm tempted to check."
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,GaussWanker,1 point,Wed Oct 1 21:49:19 2014 UTC,Please let me know how it goes if you do!
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,WolfgangSho,1 point,Wed Oct 1 22:02:59 2014 UTC,"Find a part (like a corner, branch, rock, cloud, whatever detail) that stands out to you and overlap them by crossing your eyes just right. It helps a lot if you look at it straight on, too.  I'd imagine there's a better guide on /r/CrossView, but that's the gist of it."
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,banned_accounts,1 point,Wed Oct 1 15:05:36 2014 UTC,"I can cross my eyes and get the images to overlap properly, but I can't get it in focus. I could never do magic eyes, either.  edit: nevermind, I actually got it once"
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,scy1192,28,Wed Oct 1 22:13:00 2014 UTC,"So /r/PublicFreakout seems like a wholly distressing place.  So far on the front page I have seen: panic attacks, two people who have missed a plane and are desperately trying to get let on, an angry woman from a low income area and a seemingly deranged paranoid woman shouting at a cameraman; all being laughed at. With any views trying to express compassion or rationality towards the subjects being heavily downvoted.  It seems popular enough but I don't understand how anyone can find this entertaining. Takes all sorts I guess, but this sub just makes me sad :("
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,WolfgangSho,12,Wed Oct 1 16:31:43 2014 UTC,I used to be subbed to it because of that one video of the lady that attacked the Mcdonalds drive through over chicken nuggets. I thought I could have a couple of cheap laughs at people freaking out over trivial things like that.  What I wasn't expecting though was exactly what you mentioned. I finally unsubbed a few weeks ago for the same reason. It's just depressing.
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,Tomcat1994,5,Wed Oct 1 17:36:02 2014 UTC,"Hmmm...  I had a similar experience with /r/JusticePorn. The original concept of the sub being derailed and concentrated into something completely different. Losing all nuance and instead being focussed on a particular shared aspect which in turn became caricatured to the point of being unrecognisable from what lead to it in the first place.  I think there is a lot that can be learnt from this sort of trend as a ""specific"" sub grows in popularity. If this was anywhere close to my field I'd love to look into it. I wonder if someone has."

trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,koviko,1 point,Wed Oct 1 23:15:28 2014 UTC,I can't really explain why I enjoy the sub so much beyond the fact that I've always been entertained by watching conflict between people...no wait I guess that's why.  Yeah that's it. That's all.
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,200InchBiceps,1 point,Wed Oct 1 21:34:30 2014 UTC,Thanks for this response!  Is it a schadenfreude style effect for you? Or do you picture what you'd do in such situations? Or is it something completely different?
trendingsubreddits,2hz0g6,WolfgangSho,1 point,Wed Oct 1 21:40:19 2014 UTC,"Well, I wouldn't say I get off on suffering and I don't enjoy watching the videos with those who are clearly mentally deranged. For me my favorite videos would be when people are arguing or who I might view as overreacting to a situation. I'm also the type of person who enjoys fight videos if the person doesn't get too messed up so I'm sure it's all connected. Sometimes I find pure entertainment and humor in it and sometimes I simply find fascination with their behavior, either way if I let it the sub can certainly suck me in.

I will give them the benefit of the doubt and watch the second episode though. Maybe they just really wanted to get all of the big comic nods out of the way in the Pilot.

trendingsubreddits,2h7jlg,ArthurCPickell,5,Tue Sep 23 23:23:10 2014 UTC,"Yes. Oblivion had a class system that actively punished those who did not adhere to their class skills and instead used their 'minor' skills. In Skyrim, you could become the most precise and skilled archer in the world, and at the same time become the Hulk by smashing shit with a gigantic hammer. While you can stick to a 'class' in Skyrim, you still go unpunished and it takes out the immersion that one might feel when trying to play."
trendingsubreddits,2h7jlg,MaxLemon,1 point,Tue Sep 23 23:57:55 2014 UTC,I don't think we played the same game. There was no punishment for focusing on or ignoring skills other then your classes main skills in Oblivion. If you planned it accordingly you could get all skills to 100+ and max all stats by focusing on minor skills first so you got the biggest stat bonus per level.

trendingsubreddits,2gcr07,shitmyspacebar,2,Mon Sep 15 00:10:47 2014 UTC,"Alright, stupid question incoming. I thought that owning an old sword was illegal almost everywhere. Like if it's a medieval sword, you had to notify local culture centers or archaeological centers. Is there any truth to this?"
trendingsubreddits,2gcr07,instinctblues,4,Mon Sep 15 01:07:53 2014 UTC,"No, not at all. Antique swords are absolutely legal to own… if you can afford them. They typically start around several thousand dollars and can surpass several hundred thousand for the rarest blades by the most famous smiths. There are robust markets for many different fields of antique arms & armor, e.g. Japanese, Western, and Middle Eastern; private dealers and big auction houses are very visible sources, though within each international collecting community there are many person-to-person sales & trades as well.  Now, if you find an antique in certain settings, e.g. in a riverbed or buried on your property while you're doing some construction, things get a little more complicated. It may be considered an archaeological find and there could be some legal protective status not only for the relic but also applying to the site in general, i.e. necessitating further investigation and possibly a dig. I am no lawyer so I won't pretend to know all the possible ramifications, especially when it comes to different countries.  On that note, some countries do restrict sword ownership, but not because they are antiques; in fact, being an antique is one of the only ways in which sword ownership IS legal in those countries. For example, in Japan the only legal blades over a certain size that can be owned are genuine nihontō (traditional Japanese swords), either antique or by licensed smiths. And in England, you need to either prove you are part of a recognized martial art group that studies sword arts, or that your sword is an antique kept for its artistic/historical value.  But in general, simple ownership of antique blades is perfectly acceptable pretty much everywhere."

Not just arbitrarily picking subs like /r/subredditoftheday.  For instance /r/destiny is listed because Destiny the video game was released yeatersay.  Unfortunately most folks apparently went to the wrong sub because the correct one is /r/destinythegame.  /r/gaming4gamers is on there because of a popular post in /r/games that suggested it as a good alternative sub.  /r/hiphopgifs is on their because we increased our subscriber count from ~40 to ~300 in less than a day with some cross posts and promotion posts on /r/hiphopheads and /r/blackpeoplegifs.

Mojang insists it isn't EvilSeph's right to shut the project down as they own it. Mojang takes over the website and github repos The community has a huge pushback against Mojang, as they had just found out that instead of working for a community project for 2 years, they've been working for a billion dollar company for free for 2 years. Wolverness, a main contributor to Bukkit, leaves and issues a DMCA request for Bukkit because it contains his code he's worked on and now all the licensing is invalid All downloads/source for Bukkit is pulled Most of the Bukkit staff resign due to being betrayed by Mojang and burnt out"

trendingsubreddits,2fsf7p,Glitchsmasher,102,Mon Sep 8 17:32:33 2014 UTC,"What a great day for /r/PCMasterRace to trend. Someone just made a stickied post about why it's important to fight for the dominance of PC (and oppose the gaming industry oppression of the XBox One and PS4). I can't speak on the behalf of everyone, but I think it's safe to say Nintendo isn't included in the ""evil oppressors"" list.  Here at PC Master Race, we don't hate you. We hate the consoles that bind you, rip you off, and hold you back. More information can be found on the wiki. We fight for you (the gamer) whether you know it or not.  Here's some fun facts and excerpts about PC gaming that usually get systematically swept under the rug:   You can use any controller on PC You can emulate nearly any console game on PC for free (including MAME stuff) PC gaming is cheaper than console gaming PC has more exclusive games PC has more games (it's a much more open platform) You can build a PC for $400-$450 (depending on sales) that will outperform a PS4 or XBox One console You can use stuff like SoftXPand to turn your single-display PC into a local multiplayer machine (up to 16 simultaneous people playing in their own ""terminal"" PCs are easier to repair, maintain, and upgrade (by far, you just pop the hood rather than send it to the factory) Building a PC is fun and easy for most, like Legos   It seems outrageously circlejerky to some, but there's a good heart behind the cause. Long live freedom and the free market! If you ever feel lost or have questions, smaller subreddits like /r/AskPCGamers and /r/KillYourConsole are also there for you.    Also, it's nice to see /r/DestinyTheGame getting some popularity. It's gonna be nice when the paid exclusivity period is over and they're allowed to push it to PC so it can be played at a respectable level of graphical detail and framerate."
trendingsubreddits,2fsf7p,Tizaki,6,Mon Sep 8 07:27:27 2014 UTC,"I like my PC and my consoles/handhelds. I don't need to pledge loyalty to one. Bloodborne, Destiny, The Last of Us and Persona 5 are just a few examples of the benefit."
trendingsubreddits,2fsf7p,The_Redditective,9,Mon Sep 8 23:54:04 2014 UTC,Well the freedom to pledge loyalty to anything was taken away when exclusivity was purchased by one of the console manufacturers.
trendingsubreddits,2fsf7p,Tizaki,4,Tue Sep 9 00:45:37 2014 UTC,"Before the PS4 came out I was seriously considering getting a PC gaming set up. My question is this. Is it really cheaper than console gaming?       I'm only going to use it for entertainment. I may keep it near the main tv for streaming video and to use the TV as a monitor. I like using a laptop for everything but gaming.      So say I'm going to go with a 10 year cycle with a console OR a PC. I drop $450 for my first one. I've been told I should probably upgrade it every 2 years, costing around $150-$200 (let's say $175). So upgrading this often for 10 years costs $1325. There's no way I need to upgrade that much, right?     I know games are cheaper with sales, but are they really cheap enough to make up for this cost? Especially if I only get a few games a year?     edit: Also, a signficant part of the frontpage of pcmasterrace right now is insulting consoles to make PC users feel better and random pics and comics of why PCs are great. Seems kind of unnecessary and insecure. Why is this necessary? I don't feel like the console or gaming subreddits do this.    In fact...a couple stories are news stories, a decent amount of battlestation pics and...that's it. Nothing really educational. Just jokes about how awesome a PC is. Really?"
trendingsubreddits,2fsf7p,Ikarus3426,6,Tue Sep 9 01:46:23 2014 UTC,"Is it really cheaper than console gaming?    Yes, if you intend to get the performance of a console, you will be spending less on your hardware. Same with games, they're amazingly cheap. The cheaper hardware alone really justifies the purchase, and the cheaper games just seal the deal. Even if it's just a few.  Also, you only upgrade when you want to. You've got a lot of wiggle room on modern GPUs before even the lowest settings are unplayably laggy (by lowest settings, I mean console equivalent).  See /r/PCMasterRace/wiki/guide and /r/PCMasterRace/wiki/builds for info, you can also post at /r/PCMasterRace, /r/KillYourConsole, and /r/AskPCGamers if you need additional information. :)"

There are more reasons, some of which were mentioned by /u/orost who responded to you.  Then there's what we call ""peasantry"". It's people who write posts like this one that spread misinformation and lies. That goes doubly for Microsoft and Sony for things like this.

However, it most certainly does not run at ""more than 45"" fps.  Granted, this is the beta but you generally do not see a >50% improvement in performance from beta to release.

Only one specification, there is only a finite amount of power to use so innovation is inhibited. Licensing fees, to merely develop for a console you need to pay MS/Sony/Nintendo for permission to do that.  Royalties, anything you do make MS/Sony/Nintendo will take their slice from.    Whereas PC's only limitations are how far consumer technology has advanced and how much you're willing to spend.  PC truly is the free market compared to consoles."

I have never seen Nintendo try to do this, or market their products aggressively against Microsoft or Sony. Gaining exclusive titles do not help the gaming industry as a whole because it teaches Devs of large gaming companies that its alright to except multi-million dollar payoffs in order to keep hundreds of thousands of potential customers from receiving their product. It promotes bad and un-loyal business practices. It tells Devs that they shouldn't try to create a good game that everyone should play. It tells them they should half-ass a game then make a good presentation to some corporate big-wig at Sony or Microsoft then rake in the money off a mediocre ""exclusive"" title.   Finally, marketing a game on your console of choice isn't a bad thing in or itself. It creates a unique personality for each game system. PC is know very well for RTS and MOBA's, which none of the other systems really have. Nintendo is know for its massive exclusive Mario universe, and everything else (Zelda, etc...). Microsoft has Halo, Sony has...you get my point. However, Sony and Microsoft aggressiveness push these exclusives in your face, going as far as bundling those games in your console purchase, offering exclusive rewards. Nintendo does this too, yet they do it discretely and simply offer bundles, a far cry from Micro/Sony's multi-million dollar public launch/smear campaign. You hear about IGN reviews on exclusive games which give them perfect ratings then the games turn out to be shit? Well, that's a perfect example of whats wrong with MicroSony.  All in all, exclusives done right are ok. Microsoft and Sony DO NOT create exclusives for the right purpose, and spend millions of dollars marketing AGAINST other platforms. This only serves one goal, it hurts the video game industry, especially PC's, which are the most powerful system to game on and offer the greatest variety of, well, everything. Dev's fro AAA titles end up being forced to ignore PC for huge payoffs from Microsoft and Sony. This is why Nintendo occupies a different spotlight. They stay out of the shitstorm and concentrate on what gamers want...GOOD GAMES."

After that, I had a fancy computer that doesn't do anything because I don't have  an OS. So I had to buy Windows 7. Then I just had a computer which I can only use for gaming and internet, so I had to go and buy Office too. After all that, I was still left with no games so I had to go and buy games too.

FYI - The so-called ""next-gen"" consoles run games at a fidelity equivalent to that of an underclocked 750Ti, which in itself is already an outdated and low-end card for PC standards: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/149-nvidia-gtx-750-ti-unveiled-plays-titanfall-better-than-xbox-one/1100-6417813/  You can't just buy a high-end PC and complain when it can't play everything at absolutely perfect levels. If that was the case, why would top-end hardware even be created? Developers create their games based on what hardware is available on the market. Luckily for you, the PC allows you to buy any card you want and raise/lower the settings to your desired levels. It sounds to me like you strive for nothing but maximum settings, yet you're eyeballing a console. You're gonna be really disappointed if you make that mistake.  My advice to you is... since you have what appears to be one of the best-needed CPUs for gaming in the world right now, you'll be able to upgrade your graphics card a couple of times before you'll bottleneck that CPU. PC pays off over time, you just wait for a year or two when there's a nice GPU refresh and a friend wants to buy your old 7850 from you. You just wait ;)"

trendingsubreddits,2fsf7p,Seanster141,2,Mon Sep 8 15:34:34 2014 UTC,"LibreOffice:       LibreOffice is a free and open source office suite, developed by The Document Foundation. It was forked from OpenOffice.org in 2010, which was an open-sourced version of the earlier StarOffice. The LibreOffice suite comprises programs to do word processing, spreadsheets, slideshows, diagrams and drawings, maintain databases, and compose mathematical formulae.  LibreOffice uses the international ISO/IEC standard OpenDocument file format as its native format to save documents for all of its applications (as do its OpenOffice.org cousins Apache OpenOffice and NeoOffice). The OpenDocument file format is now also supported by all major competing office suite applications (proprietary and open source). LibreOffice is also compatible with other major office suites, including Microsoft Office,  through a variety of import/export filters. The file formats of Microsoft Office are well supported, though some layout features and formatting attributes are handled differently in the application or are not entirely supported in the filters.  LibreOffice is available in over 110 languages  and for a variety of computing platforms,  including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard or newer, and Linux. It is the default office suite of most popular Linux distributions.      Between January 2011 (the first stable release) and October 2011, LibreOffice was downloaded approximately 7.5 million times.   During 2012, the office suite was downloaded about 15 million times  and in 2013 it was downloaded 25 million times.

Btw just because you're not running recommended settings doesn't mean your PC is bad. You're likely still getting performance better than a console.  Add to that, that you have the option to actually change settings to get either a better looking game or one that runs better and I'm not sure why you wouldn't be happy with the purchase.  Btw I wouldn't bet on the new consoles lasting 8 years... The only reason the last ones lasted was because they were actually better than the best consumer PCs for a good 2 years.

trendingsubreddits,2fsf7p,djpokeboy,8,Mon Sep 8 08:59:29 2014 UTC,"Okay, it looks like I'm going to have to talk about why the PC master race is inherently becoming a toxic mindset and why the /r/pcmasterrace subreddit should be considered separate from this mindset.  It's really not a secret that PCs are more powerful than their console counterparts currently.  Some people find it fun to look at this as grounds to jest (especially when the PS3 and Xbox 360 users were at each others throats) about consoles, and that the systems are potatoes and that the console users are peasants.  Much like with every meme (read: Ideology spread from person to person), the message gets skewed when it reaches enough people, and it stops becoming a joke and those people catch wind of it.  Those people are the ones who go ahead and treat the word like gospel not even knowing it was a joke to begin with.  Go ahead and hate these people, they're not smart enough to get offended.  The subreddit certainly still has those comments (like Gabe Newell being a deity, their PCs are shrines, and still peasants and potatoes).  They act more like bees than hungry bears.  If you bother them, they'll laugh at you.  Don't  let the vocal minority take away from the giveaways, the pretty pictures, and most importantly, your sense of enjoyment from your console."

They generally don't care if you play console, hell, most of them play console for one reason or another, they just don't want people spreading lies about consoles like that they play in 4K. /r/pcmasterrace is actively trying to fight people who think people who play consoles are lesser beings and they have a really great community and are willing to help near anyone in need, most people are scared off and think they won't be any help in trying to switch to pc from console, but they don't care they'll help to the best of their ability because they're awesome.

Recently Mojang claimed the code was theirs since it is just a modification of their own code, essentially portraying the Bukkit devs as free intern coders. Bukkit devs throw a shitfest over it and most/all say they're gonna stop working on it until Mojang compensates them since they claimed the code as theirs, leaving Bukkit sort of stranded as Abandonware. Mojang jumps up and says they will keep the project afloat with their own team, which in turn pisses off the Bukkit devs even more since they're essentially being replaced with paid workers, when what they did was always free and donated time.  TL;DR Know how Mojang's never done anything shitty? This might be their first time if everything doesn't turn out okay"

I've moderated subreddits large and small, and this subreddit has surprised me in that the quality has actually gotten better as it has grown.

A weird scenario! Normally as subreddits get large, the content becomes lowest common denominator bullshit.

trendingsubreddits,2f2kv9,OSUTechie,6,Sun Aug 31 17:50:20 2014 UTC,How can it be underrated? It just came out like last week on Netflix.  Given the fact that I do not recall it being advertised anywhere.

I don't recall there ever even being advertisement for Orange Is the New Black until season two came out. Also BoJack Horseman has a lot of mixed reviews critics wise if that means anything. I do think BoJack Horseman is an underrated show and has quickly surpassed most of my favorite adult animated shows. It's on top with Archer, Futurama , Ugly Americans and I'm glad to hear it's already getting a second season."
trendingsubreddits,2f2kv9,OSUTechie,1 point,Sun Aug 31 19:55:49 2014 UTC,OitNB I heard a lot about prior to season one. Since it was one of the first Netflix Original Series a lot of people were looking toward it to see if it was going to live up to the hype. Especially following House of Cards. The other Netflix originals had been kind of hit-an-miss till then.
trendingsubreddits,2f2kv9,angrypotato1,1 point,Sun Aug 31 20:01:51 2014 UTC,"Kind of hard for bojack to be under rated when it just came out, and the only advertising being netflix saying hey check this out we made a cartoon when you go to your home page.

The Last Airbender aired three seasons in 2005 and ended in 2008  They currently have a new series in the same universe with new and some returning characters, The Legend of Korra which started in 2012 and just finished Season 3 yesterday and has plans for a fourth.  The show is amazing in so many ways, great action shots, comedy, beautifully animated and good for all ages.  Definitely worth the watch."

Legend of Korra has had a tough time living up to the first show, with a first Book that felt a bit rushed and a second book that really tested my patience sitting through, but it's redeemed itself completely with the climax of Book 2 and the entirety of Book 3."

trendingsubreddits,2efgav,sgtscrapper,11,Sun Aug 24 17:35:53 2014 UTC,"Trust me, you WANT to watch the last airbender. It is #15 on IMBD and my FAVORITE show. For context, I've watched Dexter, Breaking Bad, House MD, and many other top notch TV shows and nothing gets me like this. Now be warned, season one of TLA (the last airbender) is a little slow and you may think (though only at times) that it is too childish. Trust me when I say you should stick with it. By the time you get to the end of season one and into season two the characters and themes become way more defined and mature. When you get to Legend of Korra (sequel series), the show is more aimed for the people who were kids and teens during TLA, so it is (very obviously) targeted for teens and young to youngish adults. You wont regret watching these shows (and if you hurry you can catch up before the last season of Korra :D). I hope to see you around the sub soon and enjoy your journey if/when you watch the show!"

trendingsubreddits,2ecn2u,riemannrocker,2,Sat Aug 23 22:20:19 2014 UTC,Because clothes that fall apart after washing them three times don't count as cheap.
trendingsubreddits,2ecn2u,NoApollonia,1 point,Sat Aug 23 17:06:10 2014 UTC,"I'd like to know where you bought a shirt that fell apart in three washings. I've bought shirts from almost literally everywhere and the quality is virtually the same from a $5 shirt to a $50 shirt (never paid more for a shirt).  The outfit I wore today cost about $50 (not counting under-clothes)....$30 shoes, $15 shorts, and $5 tank top. The shoes are relatively new however. The shirt is about two years old and the shorts three to four years old - both are holding up just fine and they are both things I wear on a regular basis."
trendingsubreddits,2ecn2u,riemannrocker,0,Mon Aug 25 01:33:08 2014 UTC,"""Fall apart"" is definitely hyperbole, but a lot of cheaper clothing looks significantly worse after a few washes -- sweaters pill quickly, shirts fade easily, etc. This has been my experience with H&M anyway, and more ambitious clothing tends to fail harder faster. Also, the point of most of these posts is not primarily to get a cheap outfit, but create a reasonable version of a really great but expensive outfit. It's pretty common to see people who have way too much money and dress crazy well put together something that works well, but the point is that the luxury brands aren't usually necessary."

At first it can feel like you are just following directions and have no idea what goes on in the space between text editor and game engine. But once you really start to understand the syntax, it gets easier. Just a steep learning curve. Others, like writing, are hard for me no matter how many times I do it. Others still are easy and even enjoyable because I routinely do them, like hiking! I love hiking.  It's also important to realize it's not all work. Do something silly/fun every day, it won't hurt. Go on long hiatuses from your work if needed. And take frequent breaks, for pete's sake. Just keep the routine in place."

The unique nature of the teaser is getting people to talk about the game.

This way it will keep your sub from /r/all and wont be trending.

It's important to remember that LEO's are just normal people doing a highly stressful job.  My dad used to be a cop and it boggles my mind that people don't realize this.  Anyone can be an asshole but most cops just want to enforce the law, avoid shittons of paperwork, and go home safely.  If you keep this in mind while interacting with an LEO you'll be fine.  My record for getting out of tickets is 21/25 and I've talked my way out of an arrest by staying calm, collected, and showing them I wasn't a threat. Be sympathetic to how it looks on their end, know they want to avoid taking you in, and usually you'll get off the hook."

Our own IRC channel for college football discussion We run our own /r/CFB Poll to rank teams, made up of hundreds of selected /r/CFB readers; our subreddit header uses this poll to rank the top-10. Donations: /r/CFB users have raised over $5500 across 4 brick drives across the country (placing 12 bricks in various places) and of that over $1000 to charitable causes such as the Kidz1stFund . /r/CFB runs The Fulmer Cup, a popular off-season gag price created in 2006 by popular humor blog EDSBS and taken over this past off-season with its own subreddit and a Twitter account (@TheFulmerCup) with it's own 1.4k+ followers. We run a CFB Pick 'em with prizes The user-created 132+ Teams in 132+ Days Project created full write-ups for every major college football program in America (and then some); and we're still adding to it! We have a full weekly schedule of official threads; including a number of popular weekly user-created threads that have populated the off-season (e.g. MS Paint Monday, Whose Line is It Wednesday, etc) We have an official /r/CFB ""People's Vote"" in 247 Sports Crystal Ball predictions, helping the corner of college football fans who like stalking the college decisions of 15-17 year old boys <shudder> We're inclusive in that we feature user flair for over 800 college football teams across the world. Our wiki is always growing with articles on books & documentaries about CFB as well as where to eat on gameday in each college town We have a network of related subs, including /r/cfbmemes, /r/cfbcirclejerk, /r/CFBFantasyFootball, and /r/CFBOffTopic; as well as our friends at /r/FCS & /r/Collegebasketball In addition to a primary focus of NCAA FBS football we cover all-levels and international American Football. We offer a place where the trollish nonsense that plagues ""ESPN message board"" and many so-called fan boards will get you banned, and our users appreciate that."

trendingsubreddits,2co3t9,supergalactic,2,Tue Aug 5 15:10:30 2014 UTC,I'd love to! But I don't know if I'd have time to commit to moderation. Do you have to moderate a sub if you create it?
trendingsubreddits,2co3t9,virgineyes09,2,Tue Aug 5 15:12:32 2014 UTC,"Moderating a sub isn't that big of a time commitment. You can get the sub going, then ask for moderation help. I did that with /r/StarshipPorn when I first created it. It took about 2 hours of my time spread out over about 2 weeks to get things running smoothly. Message the moderators of various food subreddits and ask if you can put up a self post promoting your subreddit. You'll more than likely find people who would like to moderate your sub.  I don't have a lot to do in my subreddit. It has a fair number of subscribers but the subject is pretty straightforward so nobody breaks what little rules exist there. There are lots of subs dedicated to helping you moderate your own sub. It's fun!  I hope this helps:)"

trendingsubreddits,2chol0,Wabbitzzz,12,Sun Aug 3 10:34:26 2014 UTC,"As I understand it, trending is primarily based on subscription activity. If the sub got linked somewhere and quite a few people subscribed as a result, that would cause it to trend. Why would someone subscribe to a dead subreddit? Why not? If it's dead, it's not going to affect your front page at all. But if it picks up in activity, then you'll get to see posts on a sub you thought had potential to be interesting. Case in point: It seems to have gotten a few posts since trending and will likely get even more once more people in the US wake up."

trendingsubreddits,2cevz1,I_AM_AN_ASSASSIN,15,Sat Aug 2 15:29:11 2014 UTC,"Here's the SRD recap of it: http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/2c9ida/recap_unibanned_a_recap_of_the_fallout_of_reddits/  If you don't want to read the whole thing, basically power user /u/Unidan was caught vote manipulating with 5 alt accounts to rise his comments to the top, even before he got famous. For a while people thought that it was based on an argument he had with someone over whether a jackdaw was considered a crow and that person got all of her comments heavily downvoted. Then he makes an account /u/UnidanX to try to defend himself in /r/bestof and /r/TIFU but is not met with universal praise."
trendingsubreddits,2cevz1,cheese9999,9,Sat Aug 2 15:58:26 2014 UTC,"When looking for recent major drama, you can probably find it in the Top posts of the Week/Month in SRD. The top post of the week is about the Unidan kerfuffle.  For those unaware and know better than to read through SRD, Unidan got into an argument regarding the term crow vs jackdaw, which lead to Admins noticing that he had 5 accounts which he would use to downvote his detractors and upvote his early posts to ensure they made it out of new. This lead to Unidan being shadowbanned.  Of course, the brilliant thing about the shadowban system is that it only effects the account being banned. The person who was shadowbanned can show up on another account, blatantly acknowledge that they're the same person that was banned, and nothing will happen to the new account. Thus Unidan can now be found over at /u/UnidanX. Something strange is going on with his karma, however, as all of his comments have been brigaded way into the negatives, but his comment karma remains at a positive level."

trendingsubreddits,2cevz1,Shadow_Of_Invisible,4,Sat Aug 2 22:02:51 2014 UTC,"I heard it was because of some anti-brigading mechanism, where after a certain point excessive downvotes stop counting but the upvotes continue to do so; unidans comments had a lot of downvotes, but also a fair few upvotes, and enough of the downs didn't count that he has overall positive karma :)"

trendingsubreddits,2c82g7,creesch,3,Thu Jul 31 13:04:26 2014 UTC,Well you could easily do a simple regex to see if it is a already a subreddit link.   Match it against something like the following (did no testing)   (\/r\/.?\/?$)   and if it returns a match don't process that url.
trendingsubreddits,2c82g7,SmallSubBot,7,Thu Jul 31 13:08:25 2014 UTC,It does that already. Just not for self.posts so far.

This year has mainly been about updating the older characters, rather than introducing new champions."
trendingsubreddits,2c4er7,GhastlyBespoke,2,Wed Jul 30 21:51:44 2014 UTC,"It used to be less than a a month for each but now it's slowly increasing with each champion. The last one was introduced 2 and a half months ago and the one that was announced now will probably be introduced in a week (or even more if there are bugs), making it closer to a three month period.   At the same time they are relaunching older champions with somewhat reworked abilities and slightly better textures, though. In the last patch, for example, they updated a champion that was originally introduced in 2010."

Luckily for you, a free PS3 emulator is in the works for PC and it's already able to play commercial titles at around 20FPS (10FPS less than the actual console). http://www.kdramastars.com/articles/29170/20140717/ps3-emulator-for-pc-xbox-360.htm  I'd bet that within a year, we'll see it hitting 30+FPS at decent resolutions and graphical settings.

trendingsubreddits,2bembb,Tizaki,7,Tue Jul 22 22:54:45 2014 UTC,"but then never update them or promote them, leaving them to die with dead communities   As expected. Valve owns Steam, therefore they have even less middle-man cash to worry about losing. They build their own updates and update systems and can push them out instantaneously. XBL and PSN screwed themselves over by making it so hard to update games (even charging money to patch games in some cases, adding to the developer cut, publisher cut, and physical game disc manufacturing cut). By the time they made updating on consoles tolerable enough to be viable, the Orange Box was already dead.  Valve's gotten better at updating since ~2010, but the fact of the matter is, consoles are still anti-developer inefficient corporate behemoths.  http://killscreendaily.com/articles/maybe-phil-fish-was-right-and-xbox-one-really-anti-indie/  http://www.dualshockers.com/2010/09/09/xbox-live-is-a-train-wreck-says-gabe-newell/  http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-06-26-microsoft-no-longer-charges-developers-to-patch-their-xbox-360-games   Should nintendo release all there games on every platform now?   Nintendo doesn't participate in the anti-PC marketing, so they generally get left alone unless someone tries to drag them into the fight. I guess they could if they wanted, but we have Wii emulators already and Wiis are cheap."

The whole ""can it play?"" question is strictly reserved to low-end PCs. In addition, it's often down to the GPU rather than the entire PC. The GPU is what plays the games.  If we're going by ""playable"", we'll assume about 40FPS at low settings and 1080p (that's pretty crazy, considering PS4/XB can only do 30/low/720p). That would be somewhere around an R7 250.

It's an awesome game  and we have our biggest tournament ever going on right now with a prize pool of $10mio. and the with the winner team taking home $5mio..  Dota can be very complex and overwhelming for anyone who has never played the game before, so I will try to help out anyone interested in the game, maybe as a potential player or just someone who wants to watch.  New Players: If you want to start playing this guy has covered all the basics you need to know to be prepared for your first game. You can also just boost up the game, which you can find on steam (it's 100% free, there is nothing to be gained from ingame purchases other than cosmetics that do no affect gameplay), and start with the mandatory tutorial and some games against bots. If you want to know even more or just want to have a quick look at how much there is to know about Dota2, you can go here (although this is still kinda basic stuff.  People interested in watching: If you want to see what all this fuzz about ""The International"" (the aforementioned $10mio. tournament ) is about, but have no idea what this game is or what these people on screen are doing, you might want to start with watching this video  explaining the game (I might have to add that the video is a bit older and the UI has changed quite a bit since then). Then I recommend watching the so called ""Newbie-Stream"" aimed at inexperienced players. For everyone else there are these twitch streams (including player booths and crowd camera) or the watch tab on the Valve website, but I recommend watching it in the game. This gives you the opportunity to listen to casters (this includes the newbie casters)  while being able to control the camera yourself, watch in a players perspective and even skip to any previous point in the game (assuming you watched it from the start) and rewatch awesome fights again.  Here is everything else you need to know about the tournament and this guy explains how the prize pool got this big. For daily information about the brackets and post game discussion just visit the subreddit."

Valve seeds $1.6 Million USD as the prize pool of the event with the Dota 2 community having the opportunity to add to the prize pool by purchasing the 'Interactive Compendium'. For every Compendium purchased, 25% ($2.50) of the sales are added to the prize pool of the event.  The Interactive Compendium this year was launched on May 9, 2014 and the Dota 2 community have purchased enough of them until today to have boosted the prize pool to over $10,000,000 technically adding over 5 times the base prize pool to the event.

Hiding an argument that you disagree with goes against the spirit of the subreddit and doesn't do anyone any good.

trendingsubreddits,2ahwvc,moethehobo,78,Sat Jul 12 08:21:29 2014 UTC,"Eh, it's gonna happen from time to time. That's the price we gotta pay to still be featured on /all, which we actually would prefer to be.  We have never wanted zero growth in the subreddit, and we are glad that it continues to be popular. It's a good subreddit, it should be popular. Our goal has rather always been to try to keep the growth at a manageable level, to avoid an overall decrease in quality (that always happens when you get a massive influx of people in a short period of time). Too many subreddits have gone to hell from growing too fast in too short of a time span; every community has it's own culture and it's own personality, and that can be turned upside down quickly if you're not careful.  Case in point, ours is a subreddit dedicated to crude jokes about national stereotypes. What usually happens when we get a huge influx of new subscribers, is that we get people who will cheerfully laugh at jokes about other countries, but instantly turn around and get angry about comics featuring their country, write long humorless walls of text describing in minute detail why the comic is factually incorrect, start fights in our comment sections, and generally bring a wave of negativity with them.  It takes a while for people to understand the nature of the sub, to understand that no punches are pulled there, and to see that everyone gets it equally.  That's the main reason why we try to avoid being in the spotlight to much. It's not that we're trying to have some sort of ""secret club"", far from it. We want to grow. We believe in the idea of polandball, we love these comics, and we want other people to love them as well. We simply want to grow the right way, so that the subreddit can continue to be a high-quality place that our long-time subscribers can still feel at home in.  It might come across as too strict for some people, but that's the way we've run the subreddit for a long time now, and we think we're better off for it. We mod hard, we have rules and we do enforce them, and we try to protect the special place we've managed to build there. But we do welcome new people with open arms. Just bring with you a light-hearted mood, some thick skin, and a willingness to both dish it out and take it, and you might just come to love it as much as we do.  tl;dr: Read the sidebar, browse the archives and read some comics to get a feel for the place, and expect strict moderation.

We also care about the state of our comment sections, and we treasure the fact that despite the nature of the sub, being crude satire about national stereotypes, it's one of the more positive, lighthearted and welcoming subreddits out there. Everyone gets insulted, and everyone laughs it off. It's actually quite cathartic in a way.  However, new people generally don't understand the culture of the sub. They get angry, they take it personally when someone jokes about their country, they start fights and attack the posters, claiming that their specific country should be off-limits (while gleefully laughing at other counties). It's always the same story: when we have a huge influx of new subscribers, it always leads to a period of extreme negativity and massive flame wars in our comment sections. Honestly, that is something we would rather do without."

trendingsubreddits,2ahwvc,adityapstar,28,Sat Jul 12 16:14:36 2014 UTC,"Because that's the way the very first comics from 2009 were made. It was done intentionally (together with Poland's colors being upside down) to piss off Polish nationalists on the German image board Krautchan. The first comics were literally made just to troll Poles, quite successfully so as well. It stuck around, as a representation of the fact that non-Anglo countries aren't as good at English and will make constant grammatical mistakes.  Good polandball-speak is an art in itself, and can really enhance the comics and be funny in its own right when done correctly."

Those are terrible (except stormfront, that one isn't stepping on any toes if my 5 sec long visit is any indication), but they don't insist they're something they're not.  The introvert subreddit is bad because it implies that introversion has some sort of cult status, like being introverted is something that you're actively doing. They draw parallels to depression, anxiety and other mental disorders that have nothing to do with introversion.  One guy was hypothesizing that being an attractive introvert would be uncomfortable, because it would draw unwanted attention. WTF?"

It's true, it sucks - everyone thinks you're strange (or at least extroverted good looking people do).

trendingsubreddits,29n0mt,hak8or,8,Wed Jul 2 18:31:05 2014 UTC,"/r/PunchingMorpheus is a welcoming breath of fresh air. It moves far away from /r/TheRedPill 's almost always royally messed up garbage and from /r/ShitRedditSays 's also often royally messed up garbage. It goes in between into where probably most of the rest of the population is, somewhere in the middle. It promotes no grandiose ideology, no ""us vs them"", and instead pushes the idea that relationships are a ""we"" thing.  Look at their sidebar thing, quoted here for the lazy such as myself,   This subreddit is not anti-anything except abuse. The name is based on a metaphor; punching of any kind is strongly discouraged. Relationships, both platonic and erotic, should be built on mutual understanding, not emotional exploitation. We're not here to point out how other people are doing it wrong. We're here to offer a better way for those seeking. This subreddit was created after /u/TalShar wrote a post decrying emotional abuse that unexpectedly exploded in popularity. Several users requested that a subreddit be created which would be focused on developing and sharing healthy ways to form and keep strong, healthy cooperative relationships.  This is a place to discuss and share success stories and ideas, and for those who have suffered emotional wounds from such treatment to recuperate together and learn to forge healthy bonds with one another. The name ""Punching Morpheus"" comes from the last line of /u/TalShar 's post: ""The Morpheus of sexual strategy is offering you two pills: Red and blue. Win sexual strategy, or lose it. Punch him in the face and tell him you're not playing his stupid game.""  This sub is devoted to ending the games and promoting relationships that thrive off communication and mutual love and respect. That said, respect others and you'll be welcome here.   Hopefully they grow and be well moderated so vile extremists from both ends don't ruin this awesome sub."
trendingsubreddits,29n0mt,new_land,5,Wed Jul 2 20:04:22 2014 UTC,"Those subs are toxic. I imagine people become bitter like that because it's easier to just hate people and views things in black and white than to actually work at it and appreciate that the world is nuanced and every person is an individual. Besides, I reject the idea that relationships are some kind of mission that you have to pursue - it's not mechanical, but organic."
trendingsubreddits,29n0mt,TalShar,2,Wed Jul 2 18:11:44 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the high praise! I frankly just expected maybe a dozen or so people to sub and two or three posts. It's not huge by any means, but it's far larger than I anticipated. I vastly underrated the desire for such content."
trendingsubreddits,29n0mt,maccabeus,-1,Wed Jul 2 18:28:56 2014 UTC,"Much like theredpill, punchingmorpheus has totally missed the point of the whole pill metaphor at it's core.  Both seem to be under the impression (despite TRP's own description) that the red pill is about winning and the blue pill is about losing, when in reality the red pill was symbolic of ignoring 'manufactured' social constructs, and the blue one was allowing yourself to be controlled by a synthetic code of behavior.  Taking the Red Pill is saying ""I'm not playing your stupid game""  Reddit just needs to stop using a movie they don't understand to summarize their philosophies on life.  ""Punching Morpheus"" makes it sound like you reject the very notion of choice."
trendingsubreddits,29n0mt,jmalbo35,5,Wed Jul 2 18:32:58 2014 UTC,"No, punchingmorpheus is pretty clearly operating within the construct of theredpill's metaphor, rather than the metaphor presented in The Matrix. Theredpill perhaps missed the point, but when it comes to punchingmorpheus The Matrix is entirely irrelevant, all that matters is the bastardized form of the metaphor that the subreddit is commenting on."
trendingsubreddits,29n0mt,Bardfinn,4,Wed Jul 2 22:27:03 2014 UTC,"The metaphor of ""Punching Morpheus"" finds an historical precedent in the Zen Buddhist Koan,  If you meet the Buddha, kill him. (逢佛殺佛) —Linji  Thinking about the Buddha as an entity or deity is delusion, not awakening. One must destroy the preconception of the Buddha as separate and external before one can become internally as their own Buddha.  Zen master Shunryu Suzuki wrote in Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind during an introduction to Zazen,  Kill the Buddha if the Buddha exists somewhere else. Kill the Buddha, because you should resume your own Buddha nature.  One is only able to see a Buddha as he exists in separation from Buddha — the mind of the practitioner is thus still holding onto apparent duality.  The implication of the Red Pill / Blue Pill duality is analogous. If you meet Morpheus on the road, punch him."

A lot of the amazing user content on /r/space originates from /r/astrophotography and the crossposts are just the tip of the iceberg. The downside is that if you let hobby astronomy get into your head it can be more dangerous to your wallet than a Steam sale.

trendingsubreddits,298x0z,maciballz,37,Fri Jun 27 17:27:00 2014 UTC,"Am I supposed to do this? Uhh...   /r/SpaceX is about a company called SpaceX (unsurprisingly). Founded by Elon Musk, the guy who made paypal and Tesla Motors (also helped found solar city). The goal of the relatively young company is rather ambitious, that is, to make live multiplanetary, get us to Mars. At first people thought he was kidding, then laughed at him. Skip a few years down the road and SpaceX has an enormous launch manifest, have delivered cargo to the ISS. And they've recently released the most advanced manned capsule to date, hoping to be bringing astronauts to the ISS and other destinations. Within the next year or so SpaceX will be launching the largest rocket on the planet (double the current largest). And they currently produce around as many rocket engines per year as the rest of the planet combined. They've also cut the cost per kilo to orbit by 50% or so depending on what you compare to (far far cheaper than the shuttle.). But we expect much steeper declines in the next few years as SpaceX begins to fly back and re-use the rocket cores. Maybe an additional 50~70% decrease.  So, that is spacex pretty much. If you have any questions feel free to ask here, read the wiki in the subreddit or ask in the sub (though it is a pretty tight-knit group so you might have better luck asking me the 'obvious' questions directly)."

Examples include those developers that recommend Unity over C++ for programmers that want to join an established company, most of which use C++ and require extensive testing on your knowledge of the things that you need to understand in order to be able to use C++ effectively. Similarly I've seen the opposite extreme and every opinion in between.

He had two somewhat similar games, Demons Souls and Darksiders 2, both open-world action RPG's. In DeS, the appeal is based on atmosphere and challenge, and is notoriously unforgiving and I love it. Darksiders is based on destroying large groups of enemies with huge combos using the latest incredi-weapon you picked up, a neverending procession of upgrades you're rewarded with. To my mind it becomes very samey very quick. My friend (who would describe himself as a gamer, he's not someone who buys COD every year and calls it a day), preferred the easy quick gratification and gave up on Demons Souls at the second boss.

Like I said, it's an american website and you are a patriotic bunch so there is a lot of nationalism here. You don't have to take every criticism of america as an ""anti-american circlejerk"".   It's really strange, but most of them seem to hate the US in every way possible.   What?! Where do you people get this?!?!?"

It's the Americans on here saying that ""Europe is soooo much better!"". It's the Americans take every oppurtunity to bash this country. Take a swing by /r/worldnews and /r/politics to see what I'm talking about. Hell, there's even an /r/AskReddit thread about the very thing on the front page right now.

trendingsubreddits,28cvgr,reddit,110,Tue Jun 17 10:00:43 2014 UTC,/r/civ is a really good subreddit.  I've been subscribed for a long time and was the main reason I joined reddit. It is one the best communities and deserves to trend.
trendingsubreddits,28cvgr,ImJayGatsby,21,Tue Jun 17 10:19:23 2014 UTC,The same goes for r/paradoxplaza and r/EU4. Strategy games and Reddit seem to go together really well.

trendingsubreddits,28cvgr,Krateng,6,Wed Jun 18 18:57:45 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I've managed to improve my game a lot through reading some posts on /r/civ. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking to get better at Civ."
trendingsubreddits,28cvgr,Denial7,16,Tue Jun 17 10:30:52 2014 UTC,"Not sure I totally agree with this. There's a lot of good stuff in /r/civ but honestly I just find it frustrating how much guff it's constantly flooded with. It's 90% screenshots of starting locations, annoyingly placed natural wonders and doge puns. Civ is an awesome game of such variety and depth you could discuss the strategy for literally hours, I feel the subreddit would be significantly improved if it was divided into two, one for ""heh"" screenshots and another for actual gameplay and strategy discussion."
trendingsubreddits,28cvgr,TheAlmightyBob,9,Tue Jun 17 12:17:51 2014 UTC,"Yeah, if you're looking for pure strategy/creation discussion, places like CivFanatics are much better right now. /r/Civ is more suited to general discussion. Indeed, check out /r/Civ versus CivFanatics CIV V general forum, for comparison. Pretty similar, except screenshots are relegated to a single thread (but that's just due to how traditional forums work)."
trendingsubreddits,28cvgr,Yiin,18,Tue Jun 17 12:33:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah but, it's that way across ALL subreddits. At least ours isn't pissed off and aggressive about those with bad posts. That's when the subreddit starts to crumble and people chose sides."
trendingsubreddits,28cvgr,DoomAssault,21,Tue Jun 17 17:03:11 2014 UTC,Exactly. /r/civ is full of extremely helpful and nice people. It's really different from most subreddits for specific games. It might have something to do with Civilization having an older fanbase than most video games.
trendingsubreddits,28cvgr,H_L_Mencken,-5,Tue Jun 17 19:44:53 2014 UTC,So it's a good thing that people don't have a problem with the subreddit being filled with what's little more than spam? I would have no problem with people choosing sides and splitting into serious and lighthearted subreddits instead.
trendingsubreddits,28cvgr,TheAlmightyBob,6,Tue Jun 17 19:47:27 2014 UTC,"No, the problem is angry little kids who get furious about posts that you can just downvote and pass by rather than post ""NERMAHGERD THIS IS LAMEZORX STAHP PLZ, WUT HAPPIND TO R/CIV MAN?"""

trendingsubreddits,28cvgr,Sharrakor,1 point,Tue Jun 17 22:22:58 2014 UTC,"They are not really all that common, you are right. There tends to be a handful of ""Such gold"" ""many trade routes"" ""wow"" comments on threads about how Venice is ""easy mode"" or the like."
trendingsubreddits,28cvgr,williams_482,2,Wed Jun 18 00:06:57 2014 UTC,"For me /r/civ is a place for beginners to come and learn and veterans to laugh about and discuss interesting things from their recent games.

trendingsubreddits,281yms,dedtired,15,Fri Jun 13 14:56:23 2014 UTC,"I'm one of the mods for /r/bannedfromclubpenguin, and I want to say that none of the other players see any of the bad words. Club Penguin's filter is actually very good. Nothing gets past it, even though some of the members have gotten very creative trying to bypass it.  I have made sure that submissions are kept relatively innocent. We have several rules in place to discourage personal attacks, and we have removed several posts that we thought took it too far.  Since I was made mod over a year ago, I have tried to make the subreddit a more friendly place. Same can be said for all the other moderators. If you think Rules 5, 6, and 7 on our subreddit are not enough, we would gladly take suggestions on how to improve it and of course, report anything you think is over the line."
trendingsubreddits,281yms,PhoeniXaDc,3,Fri Jun 13 17:45:01 2014 UTC,"I didn't know about the filter and that makes me less nervous about the impact. However, since the screencaps show people interacting, there is still some effect. Your submitters aren't running around in a vacuum (which I concede would be less funny).  I still don't find it all that funny - most of the posts that I saw over there today had a Nazi theme. I'll concede that it's not my style of humor, which doesn't mean that it's not funny to other people. I don't like the 3 Stooges either. Just not my thing. But, and despite my putting my perception of the humor quotient in the top-comment of this thread, my primary complaint was with the language in a game meant for children."
trendingsubreddits,281yms,dedtired,2,Fri Jun 13 20:07:17 2014 UTC,"Oh don't worry, I understand it's only funny to a very small amount of people, but as long as it's a subreddit, I might as well make sure that no one is hurt in the process. So far, I have only seen one instance where another player was affected negatively, and we (the mods) quickly put a stop to that."

trendingsubreddits,27y8lk,Sylverstone14,2,Thu Jun 12 22:43:33 2014 UTC,"Man, you're really pushing me into evangelical mode, aren't you? :P    There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said (those comments really do help with saving money), but since you're entering college, I'll make a bit of an exception, and say that it'll probably be the best machine you'll ever have.  In my time since I've owned the Wii U, I've managed to have game nights with my college friends and I've managed to really change people's opinions on Wii U because I have games which honestly made them happy.  I'm one of the key members of my college's video game club, and I've hosted successful meetings where we drew a sizable crowd because of how rambunctious everyone was while playing Nintendo Land.  On a more personal level, you are going to LOVE Off-TV Play. I didn't have a TV in my room last year, because it didn't matter as I spent my downtime with my Wii U, playing on the GamePad. Nintendo's even updated the firmware to allow for playing Wii games using the GamePad as a screen.  It's all really hard to describe, since it's really something that you should experience for yourself.  And one more thing - I know that my college buds are expecting me to get Super Smash Bros. for Wii U later this year, so if you manage to own that and extra controllers, you'll be set for life. I can already foretell the late night Smash playing during my junior year.    That's as best as I can do right now, since I'm pretty winded after all the E3 merriment. Of course, there's tons more Wii U content on the way."

trendingsubreddits,27kqe6,pizza_rolls,1 point,Sun Jun 8 16:29:22 2014 UTC,Personally I don't like to use labels. I just prefer to treat every human like any other.

trendingsubreddits,27kqe6,PantslessDan,26,Mon Jun 9 21:40:35 2014 UTC,Because subreddits are modded differently depending on the subscribers and/or the moderators? Just because it's a similar sub doesn't mean anything.

If you'd like a more visual fashion subreddit, go to /r/malefashion or /r/femalefashion as they are more for showing off and discussing fashion as an industry/art rather than people asking how they should dress for an upcoming event."

This is all just obviously hyperbolic stuff (although probably the most extreme cases I've seen) done in the name of circlejerking.  If you honestly don't get why honkey and cracker and other forms of 'reverse racism' aren't the same as 'racism', you simply don't understand the concepts I've been going over and over and over. Historical positions of power. Privilege. Oppression, both institutional and in the form of cultural norms.  I did see one person say 'bitch' though, which is a sexist slur, so you can have that one. It's still against women though, so no MRA points unfortunately. Sorry.  The last one is the worst and I actually dislike, but you've clipped out the sub so I don't know if it's a joke or not.

First general-purpose computing device of article  Computer:       Charles Babbage, an English mechanical engineer and polymath, originated the concept of a programmable computer. Considered the ""father of the computer"",  he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century. After working on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete.

trendingsubreddits,27dd88,-moose-,4,Thu Jun 5 17:21:58 2014 UTC,"Cybersquatting:       Cybersquatting (also known as domain squatting), according to the United States federal law known as the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, is registering, trafficking in, or using a domain name with bad faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The cybersquatter then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price.  The term is derived from ""squatting"", which is the act of occupying an abandoned or unoccupied space or building that the squatter does not own, rent, or otherwise have permission to use. Cybersquatting, however, is a bit different in that the domain names that are being ""squatted"" are (sometimes but not always) being paid for through the registration process by the cybersquatters. [original research?] Cybersquatters usually ask for prices far greater than that at which they purchased it. Some cybersquatters put up derogatory remarks about the person or company the domain is meant to represent in an effort to encourage the subject to buy the domain from them. [citation needed] Others post paid links via advertising networks to the actual site that the user likely wanted, thus monetizing their squatting.

It's just that at a moment like this we're going to have a larger than usual audience that might want some reason to rope them in, and a front page covered in grammar and the like may not accomplish that too well...  But please always feel free to submit language related things, of course. Else it wouldn't be like the old /r/lanl_german :)  Now... to all the visitors... why learn German?  Well, simple. It's a culture that encompasses 100+ million native speakers and much of the cultural heritage of English-speaking countries. But more to the point, that means it represents an excellent opportunity to, once you run out of English language things on the web to keep you entertained, find more.  And German, next to French, represents a lower barrier of entry than a lot of other cultures in that way, awful as that may be in some ways.  I know you probably don't care about conjugations and declensions. Whatever. Do it to find a whole new stash of cultural entertainment with the works of more than a hundred million often funny and always interesting people to choose from!  And even if not German, there's still a whole world out there - check out /r/languagelearning!  tl;dr: Learn at least some German because then you'll have access to another god knows how many millions creating stupid videos on YouTube to keep you entertained. Or maybe to improve your English skills (apparently) and no one ever became a worse person by understanding more languages. And yes, the arguments apply to French and many other languages too, but some might have a better return on investment than others. /r/languagelearning"

trendingsubreddits,27a3cu,maccabeus,1 point,Wed Jun 4 17:50:48 2014 UTC,I'm looking to start learning how to code and use Xcode. I have pretty much no experience except maybe some extremely basic HTML. Should i start with swift or something else?

trendingsubreddits,27a3cu,Gidding,2,Thu Jun 5 01:32:54 2014 UTC,"/r/learnprogramming has a good faq.  I personally suggest python, as it's simple to learn, but powerful and commonly used at a wide variety of jobs.  It's used heavily for web stuffs, so you can keep working on your HTML at the same time and develop two skills that synergize very nicely.  Python will teach you many core concepts that apply to every language, and makes your second one far easier to learn.    You could also start with C or Java.  Both are arguably harder to learn than python, but they have their benefits too.  C will let you develop ios apps and Java will be for Android.  Both have far-reaching uses outside of mobile devices.  Even if you start with Python, one of these will likely be your second one.  I know nothing about Xcode, but I'd be very surpised if any of these 3 languages actually made it harder to learn."

On http://true5050.com, you can give two links (to two different images, for example). The url then generated will redirect you to one of these two options, with a random 50% chance of landing on either one. This choice is reset every 90 seconds, so 90 seconds after your first click, you can take another 50% chance at landing on the other option if you want.  This means that every click really is a 50/50 chance of getting either option. It also means that you may be stuck for one of the two for a while, because, you know, statistics."

We're fairly pleased with how that thread has gone; it hasn't been a massive amount of trouble, likely due to how we've learned to handle larger events (such as the AMAs we occasionally host).

I've seen too many games recently have forced release dates, or just rushing updates, and focusing too much on art before functionality. I'm hoping Jtown keeps with this mentality, even if it takes longer to come out :)"

trendingsubreddits,26d82o,ChunkyKong64,7,Sat May 24 20:16:12 2014 UTC,"Basically it's how TES works at this point. When morrowind came out, it was dumbing it down from the glorious daggerfall. Morrowind was twitch fps gamer trash. Then people get comfy with it and is all ""Well, eh, I guess it's allright.""  Then oblivion comes out and it's considered the hugest piece of console trash ever made. Dumbing down and ruining lore. And morrowind becomes the gr8est game evar made. Once Skyrim comes out, Oblivion, well, eh, it wasn't THAT bad, I mean.... the guild quests and the dark brotherhood questline wasn't too bad. Oh and shivering isles was pretty damn good too!  So now that TESO comes out, Skyrim, well, eh, I mean, it's not perfect but it's... allright, after all. Yeah. Add some mods and it's pretty good actually...  However, I don't have very high hopes for TESO to get a boost in popularity considering it doesn't have the same dev, or modding, and costs a sub, but it's like this with anything bethesda makes. It's a cycle.  Personally I can't pick inbetween morrowind, oblivion and skyrim as a 'best'. They're different flavors of the same concept, and I've sunk hundreds of hours into each of them."
trendingsubreddits,26d82o,Dr_Trixie,3,Sat May 24 22:13:37 2014 UTC,"They ARE dumbing it down, although perhaps ""dumbing"" is the wrong word for use. The fact is that the MW -> OB -> Skyrim progression resulted in a lot of the variety and options being removed, as well as adding a lot of ""quality of life"" and ""user friendly"" options. Some of them were steps in the right direction, even when trying to leave personal preference out of it, but a lot is pure simplification.     I can see why they did it, of course. It's a game, it has to make a profit, and you can't rely on people wanting/needing to play with a notebook by the computer just to keep track of things or directions or whatnot. Not to say there aren't players who do, but you won't sell millions of copies like that. So they added things like the compass, fast travel, quest pointers, etc.       The simplification in the skills is another major point. It went from leveling being something you had to plan out carefully, ala D&D, to selecting perks. Can't even compare the two systems - both work great. But going from one to the other is jarring."
trendingsubreddits,26d82o,mysheepareblue,1 point,Sun May 25 00:43:18 2014 UTC,"Maybe it was because I never got into D&D, but despite being a pretty serious gamer that enjoys min-maxing, I hated the amount of planning that went into leveling in Morrowind/Oblivion and was dearly hoping that they would leave that system behind when Skyrim came around, which they did. It just felt jarring to be like ""Well, I have enough experience to level now, time to switch armor, go in a cave, and get hit by ghosts for 15 minutes, then start blocking and get hit for another 20.

trendingsubreddits,26acmm,dopooqob,-5,Fri May 23 11:57:58 2014 UTC,/r/IdiotsFightingThings -- ugh I do not like reddits that exploit people’s weaknesses for entertainment.
trendingsubreddits,26acmm,leontes,7,Fri May 23 15:20:18 2014 UTC,"As a mod of this subreddit, I don't understand your problem with this. These aren't weaknesses, they just people making fools of themselves by doing thoughtless acts. If a video of me were to make it there, I'd laugh about it.  Stop taking life so seriously."
trendingsubreddits,26acmm,TBoneTheOriginal,-1,Fri May 23 18:58:26 2014 UTC,"Normally, I agree with you on that point. However, looking through these, it's mostly GIFs of people doing things they should have known were stupid in the first place, not just making fun of people who had unfortunate accidents."
trendingsubreddits,26acmm,gaardyn,-4,Fri May 23 15:41:07 2014 UTC,"These images are documenting blind rage and anger. This happens at people’s lowest point, when an explosion of emotion is being directed out into the world, after being repressed and having no other means of sublimation.  From an outsider perspective, it looks absurd and stupid.      People are at their weakest when they are in this  blind rage, as the emotion is outpouring. It’s a sign of mental disruption.  I just don’t think we should be encouraging enjoying seeing people at their most vulnerable."
trendingsubreddits,26acmm,leontes,5,Fri May 23 15:45:22 2014 UTC,"Let's look at the Top Ten Of All Time in that subreddit.  1 is bunch of rioters attempting to vandalize a trash can. Mob mentality should be ridiculed at every opportunity. It deserves no respect.  2 is an individual trying to vandalize a trash can. What could that trash can have possibly done to put him into a state of blind rage and anger?  3 is... I don't really know why someone is trying to beat a hose with their shoe in order to keep it from whipping around. I sincerely doubt that it's as a result of a blind rage, however, unless the hose sprayed them in the eyes.  4 is a guy attempting to show off skills that he apparently doesn't possess.  5 appears to be a guy attempting to vandalize some sort of military/police (or maybe just commercial) vehicle by slashing the tire, and regretting it instantly when the force of the air from the tire hits him so hard that it rips his shirt off and knocks him face first to the ground. He appears to be walking rather nonchalantly for being in a state of blind rage.  6 is stupid teenagers being stupid. They most likely uploaded the video to the Internet themselves because they thought it was funny.  7 is another asshole trying to vandalize public property by punching a street sign. He doesn't appear to be particularly angry, and by the location of the camera I'm sure it's a buddy of his who recorded it.  8 is just some asshole who decided to vandalize a sign and lived to regret it. Again, no visible signs of anger, he's simply walking along the street and decided to destroy someone's property.  9 hearkens back to #4, someone who thinks they have fighting skills and finds out otherwise when beaten by a punching bag.  10 is clearly a staged comedy bit.  Going through the rest of the top 25, I'd say there are two GIFs that meet your description of blind rage/anger. One is a professional athlete throwing a temper tantrum, the other is a guy getting pissed off because his scooter isn't working properly.  I'd say 99% of these are people who were intentionally being jackasses and waived any rights to dignity they might have otherwise had."
trendingsubreddits,26acmm,gaardyn,1 point,Fri May 23 16:01:41 2014 UTC,"A lot of it is just stupidity. In fact, the creation of the subreddit is based on a gif of someone who decided it was a good idea to punch a sign. As he punched it, it turned and smacked him in the face. It's from this gif that /u/TwinsBasilTwins made our Snoo icon.  It's not intended to exploit ""blind rage and anger."" In fact, the best posts (in my opinion) are ones that are based on stupid ideas or lack of, well, fighting ability. (examples: 1 2 3)"

And the Please Read Before Posting link in the sidebar went from being an information page to a link to the theme song from Friends. But what got everyone really riled up was when the title of the page was changed from ""Book Suggestions"" to ""Dick Suggestions"". That meant that the at-work users might be falling afoul of their respective IT policies, which could get them fired even faster. ""Employee was browsing Reddit on company time"" doesn't quite have the same oomph as ""He was looking at gay pornography on company time"" when it appears on a dismissal notice.  And then, to top it all off, when the various users called /u/Noveskan out to try to affect some changes, they were met with some fairly puerile responses. First came the obligatory post from /SRD. Then came the mods from /r/books wiping /r/booksuggestions from their sidebar and wiki. And finally, in came the creation of /r/suggestmeabook to pick up the slack, which was immediately supported by /r/books. (Well, for a given value of immediately. On the outside, it looked like it all happened within the hour.)  That's just the thumbnail version. And, quite frankly, it was kinda interesting for me to watch. This was the first time I had been in position to have a front-row seat as a subreddit implodes, after all.

So, in my act of pure defiance, i called him an idiot, got gold and ended up spawning the new sub to replace it.  And thus, /r/suggestmeabook was born"

It's a hipster-ish thing to do: oh hey, there is some mundane and simple task that I can make harder by doing it an old-fashioned way (straight-blades, fixed-gears, etc).  I'll earn lots of street cred by doing so!  However, it's their choice.  Those that have this hobby can easily exist alongside other folks who don't have this hobby.  They take a very boring and run-of-the-mill task and make it exciting and something to look forward to.  Lots of other types of people do this: Hispanics love to take boring cars and turn them into ricers and white folk love to obsess about their lawn and mowing it.  As long as I don't get lip from for not ricing-out my car, or not fertilizing, or not using alternative shaving methods, then whatevs."

It was described in a New York Times article in 1998:     ""...For a fictional portrait to be actionable, it must be so accurate that a reader of the book would have no problem linking the two,"" said Mr. Friedman. Thus, he continued, libel lawyers have what is known as 'the small penis rule.' One way authors can protect themselves from libel suits is to say that a character has a small penis, Mr. Friedman said. ""Now no male is going to come forward and say, 'That character with a very small penis, that's me!'

New heroes, features and gameplay/balance changes can still be added though.

A lot of work has already been done to make the game free of major bugs (though there as still many bugs) and back then a lot of heroes were ported very quickly to have a wide and flexible hero pool for both pubs as well as competitive. As a result a lot of bugs had to be taken care of mostly because of the interaction between all of the heroes spells and some heroes feel to have been released in a hurry as some of them felt lacking in art quality, textures or they weren't available for making custom items(Some still aren't).  As of releasing further heroes, I personally prefer this slow approach as it gives them time to iron out as many bugs as possible and make heroes ready for customization right from the get go. Also, it takes a while for the new heroes to get balance tweaks and would be good to release another hero after the latest hero is considered balanced."

trendingsubreddits,25d5ka,Lumber-Jacked,10,Mon May 12 17:17:19 2014 UTC,Agreed. I like the comment it is based on is great because he gets these challenges from people who have impacted him. that way when he is doing each challenge he remembers the person and how they affected his life. It kind of loses meaning when its just people you don't know on the internet.

Internet memes such as Ridiculous Photogenic guy, success kid when used by some guy on /r/adviceanimals is called ""Image macro"" because you use the meme for your own purposes to say something.

It's all very well to act like a linguistics student and go ""it's a changing language, anything that people will understand is correct"", but there's a reason we have words and associations with them in the first place - two different words can mean two different things. Just because it's a changing language, doesn't mean definitions don't have any meaning or value at all. Not sure I'd agree that the definition of ""meme"" has changed that much in the last 3 or 4 years, anyway."

I see that as just a matter of personal taste, similar to liking the particular kind of humor in the subreddit.   I have to disagree though that they just exploit human weakness for entertainment. I see it more as human ridiculousness that I and most other subscribers find funny from this subreddit. I agree, some posts are sad and unfunny, namely if someone is obviously having a mental problem or something of the sort, and if you check it out most of those posts are heavily downvoted. But if a grown person is acting like a child in public by throwing a tantrum of some sort, they're fair game IMO. Plus, watching how certain people overreact in situations helps to reinforce how you one shouldn't act in public."

trendingsubreddits,251hbt,totes_meta_bot,21,Thu May 8 17:17:05 2014 UTC,"Having /r/UpliftingNews added to the defaults yesterday pushed our subscriber total from 72,000 to over 90,000 in less than a day so far.  Traffic is also significantly higher, and our spam filter has blown up with a lot more random posts and marketing/blogspam.  What is interesting is that the submissions and number of comments has remained about the same so far.  Granted, it has only been a day of the ""new normal,"" but I thought I'd share these initial observations.  EDIT:  We have gained 20,000 new subscribers (28% increase) in 24 hours since our addition to the defaults.  However, I think it is important to note that it appears any new reddit user created would be added to this total.  So if I create a novelty account now to make one comment and then never use it again, I'm pretty sure it would show up as +1 in the subscriber counts for all the defaults even though the account is not unique and would never see/participate in any of those subreddits.  Just thought I'd add this perspective."

trendingsubreddits,24s4q2,notyourend,15,Mon May 5 20:47:46 2014 UTC,"Just to put in retrospective why /r/ukraina was created. There is a quite popular Russian website called d3.ru (previously known as dirty.ru). It has similar system of sub-sites (something like subreddits here). Now everybody calls it a copy of Reddit.   There was a subsite called Ukraine. Moderators and admins had a lot of tensions between each other. Admins claimed that there were anti-Russian propaganda, rasist calls, etc. All of that started since EuroMaidan; never happened before. And recently admins removed all moderators from that subsite. The reason is, according to them, that somebody from FSS (or FSB in Russian) contacted them regarding contact information of moderators and threatening to shut down a website.  As a protest, all active users from subsite Ukraine migrated to /r/ukraina and had around 1200 subscribers in a couple of days."
trendingsubreddits,24s4q2,VasilyLupin,5,Tue May 6 11:59:55 2014 UTC,"Exactly this. As an almost former user of d3.ru, I confirm.  The situation was so tense, that the d3 owner (Jovan Savovich) threatened the main moderator of ukraine.d3.ru (Barceloneta, it's her nickname) to disclose all personal information he has on her to Russian special services. We still don't know if he was bluffing or it was for real, but this (and the removal of another subsite, my_ukraine) made most of us re-locate here, because we believe Reddit is a much safer place. The most terrible thing is that we didn't talk about anything forbidden, we were just discussing the true facts about Russian-Ukrainian conflict.  edit: grammar mistakes."

trendingsubreddits,24p6fl,protestor,5,Sun May 4 22:06:33 2014 UTC,"Pornography:       Pornography (often abbreviated as ""porn"" or ""porno"" in informal usage) is the explicit portrayal of sexual subject matter for the purpose of sexual arousal. Pornography may be presented in a variety of media, including books, magazines, postcards, photographs, sculpture, drawing, painting, animation, sound recording, film, video, and video games. The term applies to the depiction of the act rather than the act itself, and so does not include live exhibitions like sex shows and striptease. The primary subjects of pornographic depictions are pornographic models, who pose for still photographs, and pornographic actors or porn stars, who perform in pornographic films. If dramatic skills are not involved, a performer in a porn film may also be called a model.

If you don't like Mechs, that is fine, they aren't for everyone and it's true they are not cheap. However, it's not your place to decide what is important for other people."

I can tell you that even after owning it for so long I still don't understand why people think the mechanical key is superior. My laptop keyboard that uses a switch/rubber dome keys still feel nicer to type on. I'm a touch typist and my accuracy on the laptop keyboard is far greater than on my Filco cherry brown board.  Perhaps it's the price - people think that after spending so much it must be superior. I haven't gotten rid of it simply because I spent so much on it, but I won't lie to myself and say that it's the best I've ever typed on.  If there's one mechanical key that I prefer to all others, it's the happy hacker keyboard that uses a capacitive rubber dome switch. The robber dome just feels nicer to type on to me."

trendingsubreddits,240m7o,protestor,8,Sun Apr 27 01:32:34 2014 UTC,What exactly is github?
trendingsubreddits,240m7o,yesyayen,5,Sat Apr 26 14:56:37 2014 UTC,"Suppose you are developing software and need to change something. Normally you would be afraid of making drastic changes because what if you break the thing? What if you can't go back to the previous working state?  A solution is to make a backup before you do important changes - so you can go back to the previous version if something breaks. That's the main thing that version control systems like Git provides - they store all previous versions of the software. It can also do things like ""someone else is proposing a modification to the software - let's take the good parts and discard the rest"" or even ""find which software change introduced this wicked bug (and kill the offender)"".  Github stores your Git repository. It's a cloud service like Dropbox, but for software. It's also kind like a social network, because you can follow the code of other people and so on. All the cool kids are using Git now, and Github made it possible."

It derives from Pierre Bourdieu’s social capital theory and is about increasing one’s sense of community, granting access to information and knowledge, helping to form one’s identity, and providing status and recognition.   either i suddenly became really dull, or this has absolutely nothing to do with what /r/reddcoin is trying to do and they just co-opted a previously established academic sociological term in order to brand their blatant ripoff of bitcoin"

trendingsubreddits,23y5xz,Udontlikecake,12,Fri Apr 25 14:23:15 2014 UTC,"Comcast is actively trying to do away with Net Neutrality. What they want is to control the content and control our access to it. Look at the recent case with Netflix. Comcast decided to throttle people's connection speeds while they stream Netflix movies and only relented once Netflix started paying them a toll to user Comcast's connections. Now, this is ridiculous because we already pay Comcast for a connection to the Internet, Netflix already paid someone for a connection to the Internet, we should be able to share information like streaming videos with each other without other costs entering into it. Comcast is thus double/triple dipping into each of our wallets, essentially turning the whole thing into legal extortion.   Now the real concern with all of this is: If Comcast can do that with Netflix, what's stopping them from doing it with everything else? Comcast owns NBC Universal. What if they decided to throttle the connection to all news sites except those owned by NBC? What if they decided to throttle the connection to sites (like reddit) which are actively opposed to its interests?  You can see the danger. Net Neutrality would force Comcast and all ISPs to become common carriers. That would mean that they could not artificially restrict the flow of data for any reason. If you pay for 100MB speeds, you would get them, no matter what site or service you happened to be using.  That is why we must fight. We have to protect the Net from Comcast. I hope you will think of joining us."

trendingsubreddits,23y5xz,ChingShih,5,Fri Apr 25 20:08:51 2014 UTC,"In my case, although I do not have Comcast (I used to), it is my cable provider's fault (Charter) that I cannot have another provider.  They have a contract with the housing development we live in that says they are the only company that can provide Internet service to new customers.  I've tried calling AT&T for fiber optic connections as well as Comcast for cable connections and both say ""We cannot service your area, please call Charter as they are the only ones who can service you.""  I know this is a new development as some residents in my neighborhood have AT&T.  EDIT: Also forgot a good point: technically Comcast and AT&T DO service my area, according to their online ordering system, but when you go to place an order it redirects you to call their customer service line and that is where they break the news to you that it's Charter or bust."

trendingsubreddits,23uelt,JorWat,20,Thu Apr 24 20:22:41 2014 UTC,How is /r/MuseumOfReddit trending? There hasn't been a new post in nearly a month?
trendingsubreddits,23uelt,gaardyn,21,Thu Apr 24 08:56:37 2014 UTC,Trending has nothing to do with the content of the sub. It's about how many new people have suddenly become interested in the sub.
trendingsubreddits,23uelt,Moronoo,2,Thu Apr 24 14:35:19 2014 UTC,why would there be a trend of people suddenly subscribing to a sub where nothing has been posted in nearly a month?
trendingsubreddits,23uelt,gaardyn,10,Thu Apr 24 23:45:25 2014 UTC,The most common reason would be that someone mentioned the sub in a popular AskReddit thread.
trendingsubreddits,23uelt,AccountHaver25,1 point,Fri Apr 25 00:00:49 2014 UTC,Does interested in mean subscribed to or views or both?

trendingsubreddits,23uelt,AccountHaver25,1 point,Fri Apr 25 05:00:27 2014 UTC,Why is it being kept secret? Are they actively hiding it or just haven't released the code?
trendingsubreddits,23uelt,gaardyn,3,Fri Apr 25 05:01:27 2014 UTC,The blog post just said that they weren't revealing it. I presume it's much like the algorithms used for upvote/downvote fuzzing. Explaining it in detail would make it much easier to game.
trendingsubreddits,23uelt,AccountHaver25,1 point,Fri Apr 25 05:03:29 2014 UTC,"Oh, I can understand that. As people have stated companies might try to gain free ads via this feature. Good thing they're doing their best to prevent that. :)"

trendingsubreddits,23nvm9,Antonen93,1 point,Tue Apr 22 11:09:47 2014 UTC,"Yeah... I was there.   I was there, the day /u/vocaloidict left us.   We were discussing trending topics... ya'know, just bullshiking like kids do...   We were so damn young...  Me an /u/Antonen93 were reminiscing. Chilling, ya'know? Hanging back on the low end of a slow thread. Trying to find some Karma in a feature that most people didn't yet fully understand. That was what the Trending subreddits thread was like. The Wild, Wild West of Reddit. We all knew this was something special... we just weren't sure how to deal with it yet.   I had just pulled up a bar-stool to hear /u/Antonen93 talking about /u/Michael_Stevens and the infamous AMA from the day before.Ant recken'd that the ol' VSauce bastard had caused most of the day's trends.   /u/Antonen93 took a big swig of his 14th UpVote, ""Vsauce AMA aftershook! Buuuurp"".  Ant was obviously a little drunk. I wasn't going to correct him... we were having a good time, drinking our Votes - and lately the votes had been good. But a round man with tiny fingers - /u/Gamefire, I think his name was, took issue with the misspelling and spoke up across the way, ""Shook? But /r/CLG is trending, not /r/Alliance"". As I had expected, /u/Antonen93 didn't respond or correct himself - merely chuckling under his breath before returning to his UpVotes.  I stirred the little umbrella in my single UpVote, ""Called It"", I showed him my journal from the previous day - a comment with only 7 upvotes that simply read: ""Oh cool, tomorrow's trending subreddits"".   /u/Antonen93 simply nodded (or maybe swayed) before indulging himself once more in his brew. He wasn't terribly concerned with what I said. I couldn't blame Ant; it wasn't deep social commentary... I guess I just wanted to belong... ya'know?   That's when she spoke up. /u/vocaloidict had been sitting on the far end of the bar - to be completely honest... I hadn't even noticed her. Her single UpVote umbrella drink was identical to mine... when did she order?   /u/vocaloidict managed a smile before saying, ""Just what I came here to say! Allow me to shook your hand, sir.""  I caught what she did and tossed an upvote. Even /u/Antonen93 smiled and slid an upvote across the dark wood. Ant was about to say something but first took a big drink.  That's when /u/Gamefire decided to chime in again. ""Shook? But /r/CLG is trending, not /r/Alliance"".   /u/vocaloidict looked like she had been struck in the face... it was a familiar look...  /u/Gamefire stumbled to the floor and double posted his lunch onto the floor.   I was in shock... what a disgrace! A gentle burp from /u/Antonen93 roused me from my disgust... oddly. Ant continued looking in his glass but managed a ""You may!"", in response to /u/vocaloidict's invitation to shook hands. /u/Antonen93 reached his hand out and looked over at Vocal --  But she was gone.   I looked around frantically - where had she gone? Only her umbrella drink sat there - with three upvotes piled inside. Why had she -   /u/Gamefire continued to doublepost on the floor and I realized what had happened. /u/vocaloidict's face earlier... I knew I had recognized it - Fear. Shyness.   Just wanting to belong... ya'know?  They say /u/Antonen93 just sat there with his hand extended - for 5 hours (last I heard). And I never found out what happened to the pretty auburn-haired girl who left in embarrassment for nothing more than a careless double-poster.   But I try to be nicer to the kind folks I see in Trending Subreddits when I pass through occasionally. It was five hours ago, but nowadays it feels like it was just yesterminute. /u/vocaloidict will always be on my mind; I hope we never forget... to appreciate those who just want to belong... ya'know?"

They are in the works of getting a 4th host because their Former host WingsOfRedemption has been taking a possible permanent break from the podcast. Its a gaming podcast but it doesn't focus on gaming, they will usually talk about something in gaming news but the whole podcast is not about gaming.

trendingsubreddits,23kxir,p07a70,2,Tue Apr 22 00:41:38 2014 UTC,"Honestly, much like many things in life I really feel like people don't experience ASMR in the same ways.  For some, the videos are incredibly relaxing.  For others, the videos are weird and seem sexual in nature (which they are not intended to be).  For even more, the videos are exhilarating from the strength of the tingles.  Someone even mentioned being addicted to ASMR recently so for some it has become almost a way of life.  However, there is another subset of the population that just doesn't get squat from it, and that's okay.  It's awesome that you tried!  I think people have a hard time opening their minds to something new and ""experimental"" in nature so I give you kudos for trying it out.  If you aren't getting anything from it, no need to continue.  Maybe you can try again someday and get a different response?  Or, if you're intrigued, you can just keep trying different triggers and different ASMRtists.  I have my definite favorites and some triggers do NOTHING for me.  It's all about trial and error for me."
trendingsubreddits,23kxir,ekidwell,2,Tue Apr 22 14:54:14 2014 UTC,"Alright, thanks! I'll try that."
trendingsubreddits,23kxir,reaperteddy,2,Tue Apr 22 15:10:29 2014 UTC,"Furthermore, I actually knew I had ASMR when I was a young child.  I would go to the library and check out books.  When I got up to the counter I would almost go into a trance while watching the librarian crack open the books and stamp each one, carefully, with the due date.  There was something about the sounds, the visuals of the stamp on the inkpad, the hand movements back and forth between the ink pad and the book... I couldn't describe what I was feeling for YEARS but as an adult I realize I was experiencing ASMR back before I even knew there was a name for it and that other people experienced it, too.   I had a similar response watching Bob Ross and The Joy of Painting.  What 7 year old BEGS to watch Bob Ross on PBS?  One that experiences ASMR from his soft-spoken voice and soothing hand movements; that's who.    When I figured out (thanks to Reddit) that ASMR was a thing and perfectly explained feelings I'd had since childhood, it was like a light went off inside of my brain.  I now had, at my disposal, literally THOUSANDS of trigger options available to me via YouTube.  What an amazing revelation; to know that I could finally have control of a feeling that I thought was only fleeting and few and far between simply by using the internet to ""feed my need"" for relaxation. It has made a huge difference in my life.  I have an oasis to retreat to when my brain gets buzzy and full of thought-bees.  It's a way to quiet my mind when it races out of control.  It's actually therapy for me.  I hope you do end up finding something that resonates with you because it's a feeling I cannot quite compare with anything else.  If you can think of any time in the past when you were put into a sort of ""trance-like state"" by ANYTHING, it will help you to learn some of your possible triggers.  Once you isolate those triggers, there is almost guaranteed to be an ASMRtist out there who dabbles in it.  Best wishes!"

trendingsubreddits,23i0r6,skyman724,-19,Sun Apr 20 19:38:07 2014 UTC,"IF YOU REALLY HAVE NO ALLEGIANCE TO ANY ONE TEAM, YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT   And there is the problem. You seem to be supporting your beliefs using a no true Scotsman fallacy. To put it more clearly, let me rephrase your statement:   NO TRUE HOCKEY FAN DOESN'T HAVE AN ALLEGIANCE TO A PARTICULAR TEAM   Doesn't that seem a bit silly? That's like saying ""no true fan of planet Earth doesn't have an allegiance to a particular country"". The planet isn't defined by arbitrary areas of land just as the game of hockey isn't defined by arbitrary (the composition of the team isn't 100% by location, after all) groups of people."
trendingsubreddits,23i0r6,preggit,13,Sun Apr 20 19:40:49 2014 UTC,"Nope. I'm glad I gave you a chance to show off your knowledge of fallacies, but you're still missing the point. ""Not doing it right"" is not equivalent to ""you're not a true hockey fan."" By rephrasing my answer, you're using the straw man fallacy. Hey look, I can name fallacies too!  I'm not saying ""if no favorite hockey team, then not a real fan of hockey."" I'm saying ""if you don't have a favorite team, you're missing out on experiencing the emotions associated with having a favorite team."" I'm not questioning your love of the game and how ""true"" of a fan you are. It's great watching a game for the sake of good hockey, but watching a game while living and dying with a team is magical.   Imagine watching the CBJ-PIT game last night. When Columbus scored in OT, the neutral fan was thinking ""well, that was exciting."" The Pittsburgh fan was thinking ""dammit I hate everything"" and the Columbus fan was thinking ""hell yeah let's go!"" By not supporting a team, you're never personally invested and you're stuck on the middle of the spectrum. You don't get to feel the extremes, and in my opinion, that's not doing it right."

trendingsubreddits,23fam3,biruy,29,Sat Apr 19 10:30:18 2014 UTC,This feature does not deserve some of the stick it gets. It's really useful for finding niche subreddits which can often be better than the larger ones in my opinion.
trendingsubreddits,23fam3,PrincessOfPurgatory,9,Sat Apr 19 08:45:38 2014 UTC,There are people who don't like this feature? How come?!
trendingsubreddits,23fam3,taporslap,15,Sat Apr 19 11:40:39 2014 UTC,"One common belief is that the quality of a subreddit is inversely proportional to its membership numbers. Personally, I think this is somewhat true (e.g. comments in /r/TrueAskReddit vs. comments /r/AskReddit), however I find that subreddits such as /r/AskHistorians show that with strict moderation, even large subreddits can deliver consistent quality."
trendingsubreddits,23fam3,BoneHead777,15,Sat Apr 19 13:26:05 2014 UTC,"Yeah, fascist mods can greatly improve subreddits where appropriate"
trendingsubreddits,23fam3,taporslap,19,Sat Apr 19 13:32:56 2014 UTC,"I don't know if you're being sarcastic or not, but I do really think that strict moderation greatly improves subreddits when used appropriately. There's nothing wrong with requiring posts to be sourced or removing ""funny"" puns from threads marked as [Serious]. Personally, it gets a bit tiring to see threads with lots of potential devolve into a cesspit of pun threads, bad jokes, racism, sexism, etc. (excuse me while I get my SRS on)"
trendingsubreddits,23fam3,BoneHead777,14,Sat Apr 19 13:39:54 2014 UTC,"No, I was serious there. I prefer strict moderation over shitty posts every day"

The problem isn't just that a sub gets too big but that it's also vague as well.  I don't find /r/AskReddit to be bad.  One bad thing about sub popularity is mod abuse for money. As long as the modding team is solid, the sub stays in fair quality."

trendingsubreddits,23fam3,BaryltheBidoof,1 point,Sat Apr 19 22:54:49 2014 UTC,"The e best feature of this trending thing is it gives options for us who find a default  sub has issues. Technews as example.  But the bad mods in defaults is a issue that should be handled by the administration better.  Don't undefault them.  Come down on a default sub problem like a probation officer with KGB blood in its veins.  Default status should be a great honor, moding one should be the greatest honor a user gets.  Mods that are inactive should be removed.  Mods need to be knights of their new, look at like minded subs, add to their sub.  They should only be a mod of one default, maybe two other subs. Not the 100+ the ones in technology has.    Alternatives are great, don't get me wrong, I learn a lot from them.  This solves an issue the wrong way. Trending needs to add knowledge.  Gifextra is fun.  It is not giving me anything special.  Adkins need to make the trending limited to sub's that gift knowledge.  Make me learn admin.  Trending should also be a default sub.   Other than that it is great.  You are on the path.  Give reddit back the plethora of knowledge it once had."

I mean, sure it'd be nice if we could opt out of literally everything you don't like from taking space, but it's not Myspace circa 2003.

trendingsubreddits,2394f0,MyNameCouldntBeAsLon,7,Thu Apr 17 20:52:41 2014 UTC,"I noticed in that other thread there was some reticence about explaining how this ""trending"" is calculated (lest anybody should try to ""game"" it), but can you at least explain whether it's going to favour particular types of subreddit ""activity"" or is there a way to balance that out? Some subs might have a tremendous amount of traffic but hardly any comments while another one might have good core of regular commentators having very active discussions, but because they're aren't lots of votes and new subscribers it could be overlooked.  Anyway this seems like a nice new feature and hopefully we may all learn about some new subreddits that we may have otherwise missed."
trendingsubreddits,2394f0,evilnight,9,Thu Apr 17 12:21:04 2014 UTC,"Here's a hypothesis. Some of them you can almost pinpoint the moment or event that caused them to be trending: A day after the new game of thrones episode aired, there was a relatively higher than usual activity both in /r/gameofthrones and /r/asoiaf, and you would see them trending on the day after that.  Today, we see /r/talesfromtechsupport here, /u/rizenfrmtheashes thinks this is related to three posts made by /u/airz23, which obtained over 1k net upvotes. The rest of the front page of that same sub does not have another post with even 500.  Another trending sub from today is /r/screamingfish. This post (http://www.reddit.com/r/screamingfish/comments/235o97/oooooohh/) there seems to be the anomaly (and in reality, is a crosspost from a post in /r/reactiongifs. In that post (in /r/reactiongifs) someone mentioned the sub, and I assume a lot of people went there and checked it for a number of minutes. Not too many new posts were submitted, but a very significant amount of new non-subscribed users were checking it out.  Of all the subs mentioned, they either have: An exceptionally high number of non-registered users checking it out OR a number of posts that get upvoted out of the norm OR a multitude of threads and active participants in a 24 hour period.  So, for a sub with over 1k subscribers (as a completely arbitrary threshold), if you have any of the characteristics previously mentioned, you might get trending the following day.  TL:DR: Post your relevant sub in the comments of another sub that is on the front page OR wait for the Super Bowl OR have a life-changing event (that happens weekly!) in your normally active sub."
trendingsubreddits,2394f0,OtterPower,4,Thu Apr 17 16:25:17 2014 UTC,"how this ""trending"" is calculated   It's no secret. /r/trendingreddits has been around for several months before this feature launched. Right before launch there was a pause in updates to that subreddit for a couple of days, which is circumstantial but may indicate a connection.  The way it works in there is simply based on the number of new subscribers. All subreddits have a base level of new subscribers each day, taken as an average. All mods can see what this is on their traffic page. When the number of new subscribers spikes high above this normal day-to-day level, that's the trigger for it to be flagged as a trending subreddit. The higher the number above the average, the stronger the trend is considered to be.  I'm sure there's more than that going on with the new trending feature, but that is undoubtedly the core metric being used. Reddit is probably filtering it to avoid repeats of the same subs over short periods (such as /r/gameofthrones being at the top every Monday) and doing some other calculations to prevent abuse or balance spikes in smaller vs larger subreddits.  So, in a nutshell, trending = massive spike in subscribers above the normal level. This is typically caused by the subreddit being linked/plugged in highly upvoted replies to popular threads that are high up on /r/all."

trendingsubreddits,2394f0,deadaluspark,1 point,Thu Apr 17 22:15:41 2014 UTC,"First of all ""self-censoring"" is when you stop yourself from saying or writing something, that's not what's going on.  Second of all, flagging hot-button words in posts so the mods can review and determine whether or not the post is appropriate is not censorship.  The hyperbole around this issue really pollutes the point you all are trying to make."
trendingsubreddits,2394f0,dsiOneBAN2,3,Thu Apr 17 16:58:38 2014 UTC,"When the mods don't make the rules clear and won't communicate properly with the community they mod, it's their own fault that hyperbole springs up to surround it.  It doesn't matter if its actually censorship or not, mods from other communities have similar rules, but they don't have the hubbub around it because, guess what: they actually communicate all the rules to the userbase.  They don't sneakily add a hidden list and then self-approve similar articles for other mods.  If they want the bleating and hyperbole to stop, they've got to be transparent about it.  If they are unable/unwilling to be transparent and to have the list of banned words as part of list of rules, they will continue to have people bleat ""censorship!"" because frankly, when you are unwilling to talk to your userbase about it, that's what it looks like.  The only reason it came up is because /r/technology users discovered it was happening.  This was never discussed by the mods with the user base.  Maybe if they had taken the time to discuss it, this wouldn't be happening.  EDIT:  If it wasn't such a big deal, certain mods wouldn't have stepped down, including some of the brand-new mods who already felt stonewalled on making any positive changes to the subreddit.  Also, it was removed from the default subreddits.  I kind of think it wouldn't have gotten that far if it wasn't serious.  http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/23arho/re_banned_keywords_and_moderation_of_rtechnology/  Some new mods might be trying to fix things, but the damage has been done."
trendingsubreddits,2394f0,deadaluspark,5,Thu Apr 17 21:21:43 2014 UTC,"Reasonable redditors understand that adding important topics to a banlist without any mention of it is a sneaky, underhanded tactic that can only be understood as an attempt to guide public opinion."
trendingsubreddits,2394f0,bridgeventriloquist,1 point,Thu Apr 17 21:58:15 2014 UTC,"Yes, sneaky.  When a mod pre-approve's one of their own posts with banned words in it, but lets automod delete any other posts, that's sneaky.  And that is exactly what /r/technology mod /u/maxwellhill did.  Source post.  Yes, bleating, because like you said, there was a lot of hyperbole involved.  Yes, ""stonewalled"" as that word was a direct quote from one of the mods who stepped down.  Also, I think you misunderstand hyperbole if referring to users ""bleating"" is now hyperbole instead of metaphor.  Hyperbole is speaking about a situation and making it bigger than it is.  When someone hides something, that is sneaky, whether they have legitimate reasons to hide it or not.  Bleating refers to the fact that a large number of users made a lot of noise about it, noise that affects what was happening in the subreddit.  And of course, ""stonewall"" was referring to /u/Doctor_McKay and his relevant quote here.   I've only been a mod for two days now (off and on, since /u/anutensil and /u/maxwellhill continually attempted to remove me and the other new mods that were voted on by the mod team [except for anutensil and maxwellhill, who didn't participate in the votes at all]), but I don't think I can work with a ""team"" that makes rash decisions such as this.  I tried to help to turn this subreddit around. I really did. I was stonewalled at every corner.   (Emphasis mine.)  Sounds like at least two mods are definitely ""stonewalling"" by trying to remove other new mods.  Funny how its one of the same mods who was abusing the automod system and allowing his posts containing offending words to make it through.  Anyway, yeah, next time I'll be sure to only use words up to a 3rd grade reading level to make sure I don't fall into this trap of ""hyperbole.""  But I guess I'll continue to ""huff and puff in righteous indignation"" which is probably the best example of hyperbole to describe these few posts I have made that I have ever heard.  All that time studying for an English degree must have been a waste of time if I'm so confused about what hyperbole is and isn't.  Cheers.  EDIT: Almost forgot:   Sharing such a list publicly just makes it easy for trolls and provocateurs to make end-runs around it (e.g. ""telsa"", ""elon muks"", etc), which is why they are usually kept more or less hidden from the userbase.   Thanks, National Security State, I'll remember next time that all documents must be heavily redacted or the Terrorists will surely attack us again.  Nevermind the fact that the information contained in those documents is what would anger those who would resort to terror to begin with.  Nevermind that not doing it in the first place is a better solution.  We just have to protect ourselves by not letting ""the enemy"" know about our operations!  No offense, but it is simply the same argument tactic.  If we don't keep it hidden from regular people, bad people might use it!  Yeah, and a moderators job is to try to handle people like that.  You can go down a path that will eventually piss off your userbase, or you can be transparent about it and never end up there to begin with, like /r/AskHistorians, which is a very tightly controlled subreddit, but very clear about their ruleset.  So, yeah, you might want to Google ""hyperbole"" and then look at your own two posts here."

That said, having a disable option that doesn't require something like AdBlock (I really don't want to install AdBlock because I believe it damages the internet by sabotaging websites' ability to get revenue) doesn't seem like such a terrible idea. I don't really need trending subreddits, I'm really happy with my current subscriptions, and the Reddit admins were nice enough to add a hide feature for that thing on the left of the site. Just a simple unsubscribe or disable or hide function on the Reddit side of things would be appreciated by those Redditos who don't need this feature."

trendingsubreddits,22wws0,GludiusMaximus,5,Sun Apr 13 12:35:13 2014 UTC,"I'm sure this initiative is well-calculated and the intent benign, but I think it upends one of the greatest features of Reddit, which are stumbling upon new subs in comments sections, exploring recommended networks of subs found in sidebars, and knowing that the people in these communities are the ones promoting and sharing it, not some mysterious computer algorithm whose intent I don't know and thus can't 100% trust. Who's to say Reddit is only trying to enhance our experience with Trending Subs?  This isn't to say I trust every individual on Reddit, but I know I'm not alone in feeling more comfortable discovering subs through one Redditor's (often) genuine suggestion. The organic discovery of subs through community interaction is what makes Reddit special, and this ""trending"" has the potential to (among other things) both further homogenize the Reddit community and strip Reddit of some of the magical feeling of sharing and exploration.   Sidenote: I think /r/KarmaConspiracy and other ""conspiracy"" subreddits are going to obsess over the ranking of the trends and vast amounts of time will be lost discussing why, how, and who's behind the rise of certain subs. The meta-ization of Reddit will speed up, something I'm too keen on seeing (it's already a at a relatively obnoxious level, but I guess that's what constitutes a sense of community to some folk). Keep an eye out for /r/Trendingconspiracy. Also, will this possibly make the big subs bigger and stunt growth of younger, smaller subs? /u/grammer_polize and others mentioned that some subreddits (/r/mildlyinteresting and/or /r/oddlysatisfying) have had the honor of being ""trending"" for quite some time now. That's clearly a flaw in the system, but I guess this is happening because some people decided it was high time to make the site more accessible (an oft-cited issue among non-Redditors who have tried not-quite-hard-enough to join) and and give more guidance to users than it has in the past.     TL;DR: ""Trending subs"" will further homogenize the Reddit community and undermine the organic growth of communities  Edit: Added some thoughts, punctuation."

trendingsubreddits,22wws0,tallavery,0,Sun Apr 13 17:12:00 2014 UTC,"You worded this so much more delicately than I would have. This could be the beginning of the end for Reddit as we know it, which is, I realize a completely ridiculous statement to make, as the site does evolve with the influx of readers. One of the reasons I quit using facebook was they started adding ""suggested friends"", then ""suggested sites"", then changed the interface slowly over time to emphasize both the ""suggestions"" and their ad content. Is this just the first ""suggestion"" in an increasingly intrusive line of further ""suggested content"" Reddit will add to the UI?"

He was a little larger than Mario historically until around brawl. They aren't going to remove him now.

Also, if you even just checked us out, you would realize that to us, a ""peasant"" is a person who is ignorant about gaming and states lies and misconceptions as facts.

It was out of his control.   He was a simple man, with a simple question... in all honesty - he hadn't expected a response at all. But here it was - sarcasm thread had reared it's ugly head. Why did this always happen to /u/TheRileyss? He hadn't asked for it.   Curiosity.  That was the problem. His mother had always said ""/u/TheRileyss , don't be afraid to ask questions, or you'll never learn"". That had seemed so simple, so... innocent... back then. /u/TheRileyss had structured his entire life around this mantra: Ask & Learn.   It's how He found out where babies come from before any of his schoolyard friends. It's how he knew the name of every mailman who ever darkened his mailbox. He used it to exploit Teacher's preferences, so he always had the best grades. He asked an officer what the problem was in JUST the right way and got out of a speeding ticket. It was how he was able to slide through college, like a well-oiled slug on a wet wart-hog's backside. It was how he was able to ask his best sources for the very best job opening with access to Reddit.  But this... there wasn't a question for this. Only sarcasm and dull reality piled upon a joke! Had he asked in the wrong sub? Did he accidentally reference something? Why was a question bringing darkness into his life?  /u/TheRileyss began to sob. He never replied to the mockery of answers that damned him into his now degenerative state. He fell out of his chair and knocked over the photo on his mahogany desk; his face boxed the carpet in one, solid, crash.  As he cried, he noticed the carpet smelled like strawberries... freshly squeezed and flowing with the most pleasant aroma he had ever smelt. He did not know the carpet (he had walked upon for months!) was this... Arcadian.   He wept as the picture that had fallen of his mother looked at him with empty eyes.   ""Why... stawberries...?"", But there was no answer."

Before then, every year in September, a large number of new university freshmen acquired access to Usenet for the first time, and took some time to become accustomed to Usenet's standards of conduct and ""netiquette"". But, after a month or so, these new users would learn the networks' social norms or simply tire of using the service. However, for the pre-existing users of Usenet, the influx of new users from September 1993 onwards was a new and endless manifestation of the phenomenon.

trendingsubreddits,22rfcu,biowtf,17,Fri Apr 11 21:03:16 2014 UTC,Isn't the point of this to help you find more subreddits that you may be interested in that you may not have found previously?  I occasionally will start searching random things to see if they exist but it gets a little annoying.  Otherwise you just have to rely on someone posting it to a thread you are reading.
trendingsubreddits,22rfcu,HazelNutBalls,6,Sat Apr 12 07:05:52 2014 UTC,"This has nothing to do with a popularity game, it's about letting people know of subreddits they would otherwise never have heard of.

trendingsubreddits,22rfcu,HazelNutBalls,2,Fri Apr 11 17:48:05 2014 UTC,"It has nothing to do with Digg.  What happened on Digg primarily to do with the site being very easy to game:   From the beginning of Digg's popularity, a crew of power users known as the Bury Brigade exercised their influence in ways that hurt the site overall. The Bury Brigade mercilessly downvoted stories they didn't agree with or like, pushing their favored content to the top. One particular study found that 56% of Digg's front page content was contributed by a mere 100 users in 2006. The system was flawed in that users could manipulate the site for profit and for ideological purposes. Though making money is one of the primary reasons the Internet exists in the first place, it can potentially wreck a site if that's the sole focus.

I won't be using it. If I was curious about new subreddits, I'd use the random button that's been up top for I don't know how long.   The flip side of the question you ask is: why wouldn't you want the ability to disable trending subreddits? If it were about monetization, I'd understand that. If it were complicated to disable, I'd understand that. It appears to be neither of these things, though. People already have AdBlock and Greasemonkey methods to disable it. I don't use AdBlock because I believe Reddit requires ad revenue on top of all the Reddit Gold I've bought to continue being successful."

trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,Blindsniper1,505,Thu Apr 10 20:12:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah, was confused at first but it's definitely a fantastic addition to reddit. Did they say anything in the blog about it at all? I had no idea they were going to implement it. It's a great feature."
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,tt12345x,360,Thu Apr 10 20:16:15 2014 UTC,You wanna know what's really oddlysatisfying? The sidebar is gone!

trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,albinobluesheep,100,Thu Apr 10 20:26:40 2014 UTC,"I still see it, but it's only on the front page.  ... although I think that's how it's been for a while?"
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,NotReallyMyJob,14,Thu Apr 10 20:33:49 2014 UTC,"and now it's back? Maybe they should only have the multi-reddits on the ""front"" page, but not /r/all?"
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,albinobluesheep,28,Thu Apr 10 20:41:00 2014 UTC,They need a way to opt out of it. I don't use multireddits and accidentally click it all the time.

trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,geoff_,34,Thu Apr 10 22:01:02 2014 UTC,It's the left edge of my screen. So if I go to upvote/downvote something but overshoot it I end up on it.
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,jhc1415,6,Thu Apr 10 22:02:55 2014 UTC,Ah okay that makes sense.

trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,rawrower,22,Fri Apr 11 00:02:14 2014 UTC,It's okay. This feature will bring new life to the Reddit experience. You'll come across new-ish subs before they get too popular. Reddit is helping you be a hipster.  I hope to see /r/BasicIncome trending soon ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ

trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,grimskrotum,4,Thu Apr 10 20:45:53 2014 UTC,Was I the only one who didn't really mind the sidebar? I mean I think this is a fantastic addition but I kinda got used to it by now.

trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,MangoBitch,15,Thu Apr 10 22:22:09 2014 UTC,Sounds like /r/minimalism is perfect for you.
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,Lucretius,7,Thu Apr 10 22:50:41 2014 UTC,"reddit.com##.trending-subreddits   Thank you, That works... for people who need a more blow-by-blow description of how to do this in Firefox:   Download and install this extension, Adblock Plus.  It's the top downloaded extension for all of Firefox, and an essential in my opinion anyways, so you probably should have it already. Find the Adblock filter preferences.  There are a couple of ways to get there.  Probably the most simple way is press Ctrl+Shift+A, which should open a tab with a list of installed addons.  Then right-click on the adblock entry and select ""Options"", then click the button labled filter preferences. In the Filter Preferences dialog box, select the tab labled ""Custom Filters"". In that tab click the button labled ""Add Filter Group"".  Select a name for the filter group... mine was ""reddit hacks"".  Make sure the check box beside it remains checked. Select the new filter group, and then in the right pane, click the button ""add filter"". copy ""reddit.com##.trending-subreddits"", and past it into the field for the new filter.  Hit return, and close the dialog. Reload reddit's front page, and if everything went right, enjoy a less cluttered, more useful reddit interface!   Generally though, it shouldn't be necessary to go to such lengths... reddit really should offer an off-switch for this sort of thing."

Is it when a lot of subscribers suddenly come out of no where to sub it? or is it if the sub shows potential and gradually seems to be increasing?  Just wondering because I have a relatively small sub /r/UnitedWeStand (dedicated to start working towards a world based on kindness, cooperation, and seeing past our differences) and even though it could interest many people, I just don't know how to reach them properly.   /r/trending could be useful but it would already have to be trending to make the list.

trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,DigbyMayor,63,Thu Apr 10 21:09:19 2014 UTC,My guess is that a lot of people have flocked over there recently due to the Smash Bros Direct. Or maybe the stuff surrounding EVO/MLG. There's been a lot of news lately.

On facebook, articles might be trending but after enough people learn about it, it dies. However with reddit, if a sub is trending, it will just continue to stay trending with a positive feedback loop until it isn't popular anymore.   How exactly would this really help other smaller subs reach bigger crowds then? It is like saying - Hey if you are popular, then we will make you even more popular. Also I am going to expect people to spam their subs a lot more in hopes to make it trend. Not sure if its a good approach just yet, but hopefully they have put more thought into this."

trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,jeanlucpikachu,3,Fri Apr 11 03:24:11 2014 UTC,"Haha, I subscribe to that but didn't even notice!"
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,DrunkenJediKnight,13,Fri Apr 11 05:13:52 2014 UTC,Looks exactly like facebooks hashtag trending.
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,scootercity,18,Fri Apr 11 05:45:15 2014 UTC,Is there a way to hide these popups?
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,StevieSmiley,3,Thu Apr 10 20:44:07 2014 UTC,Add  .trending-subreddits {display: none;}   to your userjs.
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,alkyjason,22,Thu Apr 10 20:46:05 2014 UTC,"My immediate thought was ""Are we fucken facebook/twitter now?""  But copying the idea makes some sense. It's kinda like the front page of non-default reddit. Whatever is ""trending"" is more specific to reddit's interests at that time (and also centered around events) which is like how the site was when there were no subreddits.  Definitely think a way to make this optional would be wise, though."
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,david_ca1226,7,Fri Apr 11 02:06:44 2014 UTC,"Great, now I can waste more time."
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,IAmTheZeke,8,Thu Apr 10 20:19:51 2014 UTC,"I would much prefer if this were available on the sidebar of the homepage. That way, it appears less facebook oriented. I do appreciate the blurbs for each sub, though."
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,pyx,7,Thu Apr 10 20:15:15 2014 UTC,so is /r/trendingsubreddits a trendingsubreddit?
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,cffff,5,Thu Apr 10 20:21:48 2014 UTC,Is there an option to turn off or disable this? I don't like it.
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,classic_collector,55,Thu Apr 10 23:31:48 2014 UTC,Did this show up on anyone else's front page?
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,ceelion,50,Fri Apr 11 03:33:07 2014 UTC,No... maybe...   refreshes page  Yes...

trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,evanvolm,14,Fri Apr 11 05:43:05 2014 UTC,Haha a bit of /r/wowthissubexists on the frontpage! Awesome.
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,Lucretius,14,Thu Apr 10 20:13:45 2014 UTC,Is the /r/ in front of  what subreddit a post has been posted to new? It seems kind of redundant to have and it bothers me for some reason
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,PraetorianXVIII,8,Thu Apr 10 20:12:39 2014 UTC,"I guess it's related to branding, they want to make more users aware of the /r/subreddit notation."
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,Auxonin,10,Thu Apr 10 20:45:37 2014 UTC,Don't do this.  It's too internet.  I just want reddit.
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,barium111,4,Thu Apr 10 21:08:25 2014 UTC,A-mazing.... would be cool if you could get more trends on the front page
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,ImAWhaleBiologist,5,Thu Apr 10 21:29:32 2014 UTC,"It's a positive feedback loop! The subreddits are trending and thus appear on this board, users see them on this board and visit/subscribe to the subreddits. Due to the rise in views and subscriptions, the subreddits remain on this board."
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,sligowaths,27,Thu Apr 10 21:33:10 2014 UTC,How do I disable this?
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,Ulios,26,Thu Apr 10 23:35:05 2014 UTC,Add this to your AdBlock filter:  reddit.com##.trending-subreddits  (at least that's how it is for Firefox)
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,rimo,4,Thu Apr 10 20:37:09 2014 UTC,"reddit.com##.trending-subreddits   Thank you, That works... for people who need a more blow-by-blow description of how to do this in Firefox:   Download and install this extension, Adblock Plus.  It's the top downloaded extension for all of Firefox, and an essential in my opinion anyways, so you probably should have it already. Find the Adblock filter preferences.  There are a couple of ways to get there.  Probably the most simple way is press Ctrl+Shift+A, which should open a tab with a list of installed addons.  Then right-click on the adblock entry and select ""Options"", then click the button labled filter preferences. In the Filter Preferences dialog box, select the tab labled ""Custom Filters"". In that tab click the button labled ""Add Filter Group"".  Select a name for the filter group... mine was ""reddit hacks"".  Make sure the check box beside it remains checked. Select the new filter group, and then in the right pane, click the button ""add filter"". copy ""reddit.com##.trending-subreddits"", and past it into the field for the new filter.  Hit return, and close the dialog. Reload reddit's front page, and if everything went right, enjoy a less cluttered, more useful reddit interface!   Generally though, it shouldn't be necessary to go to such lengths... reddit really should offer an off-switch for this sort of thing."
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,ilovecfb,23,Thu Apr 10 21:25:14 2014 UTC,"Agreed.  What is this, facebook?"
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,iamesauce,10,Fri Apr 11 01:50:07 2014 UTC,Thanks reddit Admins! This is quite useful for burning even more of my time.
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,Lugonn,16,Thu Apr 10 20:46:47 2014 UTC,How to disable it? I dont want to see it.
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,ehManiacal,9,Thu Apr 10 20:22:54 2014 UTC,"Add ""reddit.com##.trending-subreddits"" to your filters if you have AdBlock."

Hope you like pictures of doors, beaches and clouds.  In a few months /r/HIMYM will be nothing but yellow umbrellas."
trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,IAmTheZeke,6,Thu Apr 10 20:30:00 2014 UTC,"Even some shows that aren't canceled... like /r/community being almost entirely .gifs (or it used to be), /r/doctorwho having a bunch of stuff that just drove me away from it (I don't really remember details very well).   Old game subreddits too, mostly little more than some silly memes or other not very interesting content. Some exceptions though, I still occaisionally see something cool from /r/morrowind or /r/baldursgate at least!"

trendingsubreddits,22pwe7,ArgonNightmare,3,Thu Apr 10 22:12:55 2014 UTC,This is pretty cool. How do they decide what's trending? Number of posts?

trendingsubreddits,21wkqf,reddit,10,Tue Apr 1 07:00:32 2014 UTC,So this is new.

trendingsubreddits,21wkqf,Javindo,2,Thu Apr 10 22:15:18 2014 UTC,Except I don't see why people would subscribe to it since if they want to see the one and only daily post it's already on the top of their front page. You won't be missing anything by not subscribing to the subreddit!
trendingsubreddits,21wkqf,glitchn,2,Fri Apr 11 03:47:18 2014 UTC,So what criteria are used to select the top five? Just curious...
