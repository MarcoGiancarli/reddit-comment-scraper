ar15,3e23nb,bendekopootoe,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:50 2015 UTC,Anyone who can legally possess a firearm can make a firearm for their own personal use. As long as you print the files then it's your firearm. Same as a person pressing start on a cnc or a person finishing an 80% paper weight.

ar15,3e23nb,bendekopootoe,2,Tue Jul 21 17:22:01 2015 UTC,But mixing rifle and pistol powders has nothing to do with a lower. Darwinism at its finest right there.
ar15,3e23nb,Whit3W0lf,2,Tue Jul 21 17:34:16 2015 UTC,You're not understanding my point. No kidding hand loading your rounds has nothing to do with the lower. Of course. An improperly loaded round is just one example of what could go wrong.   What about a barrel obstruction? That could lead to a lower exploding.   Water in the barrel is another.  Improper headspace can make the lower explode.   A cooked off round prior to the bolt locking is another.   There are a number of reasons that the lower can explode.
ar15,3e23nb,bendekopootoe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:57 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you on all accounts. Regardless of material the lower is when something bad happens, it'll be a bad day.  The same with the argument of upper material, 6061 vs 7075 alum... Is it better to be softer and bulge or break away in larger chunks vs be a harder material and possibly fracture into a bunch of tiny pieces upon failure.   Would be it better to possibly have plastic or aluminum chunks fly in the event of a catastrophic failure. Usually for a lower to be affected, something really had to have gone wrong from an end user. Either cleaning, setup and manufacture or a combination of all of those."
ar15,3e23nb,kronaz,2,Tue Jul 21 21:10:09 2015 UTC,"Most of the explosion happens in the upper, the lower is just sort of the ""chassis"" that everything else rides on. No, a plastic one won't hold up as well as a steel one, but there's no reason it should explode."

ar15,3e3pbd,proquo,3,Tue Jul 21 18:43:36 2015 UTC,SHTF you don't want a 6.5 grendel. You'll never be able to find ammo if you live long enough. Either go with an AR15 or a 308 rifle if you want a larger caliber.

Sure, if it was as redily available like 5.56 and the 7.62's it would be my first choice, but it's VERY far from redily available or affordable for that matter."
ar15,3e3pbd,steven8889,2,Tue Jul 21 21:06:34 2015 UTC,"I am currently in the middle of my own 6.5 build. I went with the start from scratch method, I'm not a big fan of buying complete uppers. Precision firearms has 6.5 uppers, as well as some pretty good barrel / bolt combinations that are matched in house, so no headspace issues.  I really wish r/65grendel would gain a following like this subreddit, I get on the 6.5 grendel forum here and there, but I like reddit much better.  Anyway, I love black hole weaponry barrels so that is what I'm going with (20"" rifle length). If you really want the 18"" barrel, the black hole weaponry that I'm looking at has a custom gas tube length that is in between a mid-length and rifle length. I haven't looked at their other barrel options to see if they all have this custom gas  length, they may or may not.  As far as magazine choices you have ASC, C-Products, Alexander Arms and AR Stoner as your grendel specific choices. There's some way you can use PRI 6.8 mags, but I would rather just get a real grendel mag. ASC and C-Products are supposed to be the better choices, and come in 5,10,15 and 25 rd. Capacities I belive."

Edit: Per my understanding the 18"", 19.5"", 20"", and 24"" barrels seem to be the most popular.  I'm not finding many, if any, 18"" rifle length gassed barrels - it appears the middy is pretty common.  Both are a turn off for me given my previous 556 experience, but the 18"" middy is more so due to increased dwell time which I feel would still play a part just as much as it does in 556.  I think I'd go for the 19.5 or 20 personally given I'd be toting it around and using it for hunting too.  The 24"" seems to be the way to go for the long range shooters which does makes sense.  I'm seeing supersonic results out to 1200-1300 yards in some cases."

I've done a bit of research, but ended up not building. It's a cool round, but I went with 308 on the ar10 platform instead.   Black hole weaponry makes barrels for a good price. They also do the 264lbc. Didn't get as far as mags, but they're out there.   The wolf is said to be OK for plinking, but not distance. Hornady makes some good amax for it.   I liked the idea of a 6.5 on the ar15 platform, but I just couldn't justify it against the ar10 market flooding. Plus, it's really not much heavier."
ar15,3e3pbd,roweyourboat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:26 2015 UTC,"If you want a 6.5, go for the creedmoor. It's a more well-known and well-supplied round. Granted, that means stepping up to an AR10 platform, but you'll find  10x more creedmoor rounds than grendel rounds come SHTF (Though you'll be able to find 1000x more .223 and .308, but you gotta balance probability with what you'll actually be using the rifle for until SHTF).   Personally, I have a feeling you won't hear anything about the 6.5 grendel in another 5 years. Just too few people doing anything with it.  With the newer .223 bullets that are out, they've got very similar range and accuracy abilities. Granted, the 6.5 will have more energy at that range, but it's not really enough to justify the additional cost and rare-ness of the rounds.  I could be wrong. But I wouldn't buy/build a gun chambered for it."

ar15,3e48en,hijacked86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:00:46 2015 UTC,Very nice for quickly locking the bolt the rear and releasing it after reloading.  It does speed things up a lot over using the standard catch/release.  I however really only see it being acceptable for gaming purposes.  I've heard of and have personally run into issues with the bolt not locking to the rear on the last round due to the BAD and I pulled it off my AR after I had that problem a couple years-ish ago.

Paint jobs look like they would be a lot of fun to do, but I should probably keep mine plain black. There's a decent chance I will want to use it as a personal patrol rifle for work at some point. Even if I could come up with a camo pattern that would be effective in a suburban environment, I'm not sure it would look as professional.   I do really like that look though. Makes me dream.

I've been accumulating different ambi CHs, out of curiosity from the design/performance aspect and was surprised to find your pictures of the Avalanche as I hadn't seen or heard of it before. I have the RA Raptor, a VLTOR/BCM and a LWRC. The modularity of the Avalanche is very interesting as is the linkage from what I can tell from your pictures."

ar15,3dzjb4,casual_slavery,3,Mon Jul 20 22:15:43 2015 UTC,While I've got you here....the atlas worth the coin over the harris?   I'm looking to put a bipod on a qd mount for my recce and I'm debating.
ar15,3dzjb4,KYLYKaHYT,2,Tue Jul 21 00:26:03 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  We're big fans of the Harris S-BRM 6-9.  Especially with the LaRue built in mount/throw lever as it weighs less than connecting it to an adapter and it sits closer to the rail (assuming you don't mind throwing down the change for less weight and height).  The S-BRM can do 90% of what the ATLAS can do and I'd wager that's more than enough for 98% of people.  However, the ATLAS is much more flexible in that the legs can go in a large variety of configurations and it can get very low when the legs are set at the angle.  It has more flex than the Harris which really helps in pre-loading the bipod and the standard rubber legs that come with it work well on nearly all surfaces and especially well on concrete, much better than the Harris.  I haven't tried any of the additional replacement legs, but I've had no need to.  Comparing weight, the ATLAS will be a bit lighter than the S-BRM when connected to a secondary mount, but it weighs basically the same compared to the LaRue version.  Is the ATLAS better than the Harris?  Yes, I believe so.  However, you just have to weigh the pros and cons and decide if it's worth the $280ish for it.  Edit: Also, I should mention we prefer the ADM mounts to the LaRue and the ATLAS has that going for it as well."
ar15,3dzjb4,mkcoia,2,Tue Jul 21 01:17:05 2015 UTC,I appreciate it man. Lots of good info to think on. The atlas seems like the logical choice if you're not considering the cost. I'll have to decide if I can stomach the extra pennies. Thanks again.

The only advantage of going this route is that you can reuse your lower if you have an upgraded trigger/stock/etc.  Also, it's the same weight as an AR and it's made of metal instead of plastic.  Still, for the cheapest option a M&15-22 is great."
ar15,3e1qgg,lulzTeddy,2,Tue Jul 21 07:48:27 2015 UTC,"You can tune your system to use just enough gas to cycle the bcg and minimize the felt recoil. Nothing wrong with a little more oomph though, but less recoil might be good in competitions for example.  One example detriment: your tuning is probably great for certain ammo you tuned with, but other ammo may not function properly without further adjustments.  On the other hand, using less gas means less wear and tear on your rifle."
ar15,3e1qgg,fucema,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:27:17 2015 UTC,"The intro portion of this should be helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkXRtTqs_4A  Assuming the same carrier velocity, a light carrier will have less momentum (mass x velocity) than a heavier one. This would reduce what's referred to as the second and third stage recoil forces in the video above. A heavier carrier will have more momentum at the same velocity which can increase reliability by allowing it to plow through carbon/mud/etc. better than a lighter carrier (objects in motion etc.).  An adjustable gas block lets you regulate the carrier velocity. If a gun is over-gassed with a specific ammo/buffer/muzzle device combination, you can bring it down to something more tolerable or tune something properly gassed down to minimize that second and third stage recoil at the cost of momentum and reliability.  tl;dr: momentum = mass x velocity. Carrier/buffer selection can change the mass, adjustable gas blocks can change the velocity. More momentum yields slightly better reliability (up to a point since too much velocity will hurt reliability) with a dirty rifle but also mean greater recoil forces."
ar15,3e1qgg,BadLuckLottery,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:34:57 2015 UTC,"Before I had an adjustable gas block in my 16"" carbine gas rifle with standard M16 carrier, I ended up having to run an H2 buffer to get that perfect 3-4:00 ejection pattern. Once I went to an SLR adjustable gas block, I was able to tune it to shoot at the same ejection pattern and lock back on an empty magazine with a standard C buffer. The rifle also seems to shoot a bit softer too."

It's extremely annoying while talking to someone if there is shooting the the background because the volume of the voice goes up and down constantly. It's so sensitive if I clap my hands while wearing the 100s I notice it.  The Howard leights just simply block out sounds above a  certain dB rating. So they don't have this volume issue.

Fitting better with glasses and hats.
ar15,3dygi8,CyberBill,2,Mon Jul 20 17:14:24 2015 UTC,"I own three pairs of Howard Leights - one pair of the 'Impact Sport' version and two of the 'Impact Pro' version.  I like the Pro version much better for indoor shooting - it blocks significantly more noise than the Sport.  A lot of people use the Sport and then add ear plugs, but I find that both uncomfortable and counter productive if you're spending the money on electronic ear muffs.  For outdoor shooting, either is fine.  When turned all the way up, both allow you to hear better than without the ear muffs on, which is great.  If you're shooting with someone, you can whisper to them with no issues."
ar15,3dygi8,wolfenkraft,2,Mon Jul 20 16:45:43 2015 UTC,"I have the Howard Leight Impacts. They're pretty good, except I also have to wear foam in-ear plugs when shooting my rifles indoors with them. They don't mold to the side of my head that great, but they're probably better than others and they're really inexpensive."
ar15,3dygi8,casual_slavery,2,Mon Jul 20 18:36:29 2015 UTC,I have to double up with them even outdoors.
ar15,3dygi8,GoldenGuy2,2,Mon Jul 20 19:55:06 2015 UTC,What are you shooting?
ar15,3dygi8,casual_slavery,2,Mon Jul 20 20:22:54 2015 UTC,.223 with lantac muzzle break is uncomfortable to shoot without doubling up.  I'm fairly certain you'd get gradual hearing damage over time if you don't.
ar15,3dygi8,Weasel1088,2,Mon Jul 20 20:27:33 2015 UTC,Better safe than sorry. Combination of that muzzle brake and a ported glock gave me permanent damage. Maybe 10 rounds from the glock and 5 from the Lantac.
ar15,3dygi8,casual_slavery,2,Mon Jul 20 22:18:48 2015 UTC,"You don't have to tell me twice.  My little cousin, being the sweet little genius that he is, decided to blow up one of those ""snapper"" mini-firecrackers right in my ear.

My girlfriend bought me MSA Sordins and I love them.  The gel ear cups are super comfy and the ambient sound amplification is amazing.

I thought the Sordins were more comfortable and blocked sound better than the HLIS. I think this is due to the Sordins fitting my head better and creating a better seal as I believe the HLIS have a higher NRR out of the box. I don't know if the ones I wore had the gel ear cup inserts or not though.   Are Sordins worth ~8x as much...? I don't know. I want them, but I'm not sure I could ev... Who am I kidding I have horrible impulse control. If I can find them on sale, they'll be mine eventually. Hopefully my HLIS break and I HAVE TO buy new ones. You can't improve your hearing, might as well protect it as best as possible if you can swing the cost. I do double up with foamies when indoors (99% of my shooting) for the record."
ar15,3dygi8,richmds,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:40:04 2015 UTC,I have the Howard Leights and they are OK.   I found on the volume control it is too quiet and then too loud. The gradual increase doesnt have a happy in between. I also find that the electronics sometimes has a very minor delay when differentiating between gunshot and talk. There is also the occassion where the electronics buzz and crackle for some reason.

ar15,3dygi8,criticalnegation,6,Mon Jul 20 16:48:24 2015 UTC,I have a pair of those and unfortunately they are too large. When I form an appropriate cheek weld it hits on the stock and is uncomfortable. I also like the ability to talk to the person I go to the range with and not having to yell back and forth.

ar15,3dygi8,criticalnegation,7,Mon Jul 20 20:55:04 2015 UTC,The 'tacticool' stuff he's looking at is different than the plain unit you link to.  Those units use electronics with microphones and speakers to allow you to hear normal sound levels (like conversation) but blocks out dangerous sound levels (like gunshots).  Take a look at them before looking down your nose at them.

ar15,3dwvam,stanleyfarnsworth,2,Mon Jul 20 14:51:30 2015 UTC,"Geissele SSA-E. Not that you asked, but I was torn between the SSA and the SSA-E. If I were to do it again I would go with the SSA. The SSA-E is just a little too light for me. Sometimes when it breaks it surprises me and I don't like that. I like to know exactly when it's going to go off. Hence why I manipulate the shit out of my safety. It needs to be on AT ALL TIMES if you're not intending to fire."
ar15,3dwvam,hamburgerdan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:31:55 2015 UTC,"I picked up a SSA-E a few weeks ago and I've taken it to the range twice since then. I completely agree that it is very light but I feel I'm already starting to grow accustomed to it. Although, I obviously don't do as much movement as you do when I'm at the range. I pick my position, unload the magazine, put the weapon on the table and repeat.  I also picked up the SSA during their July 4th sale for another project I'm working on. Can't wait to feel the difference side by side."

I've never shot at paper to measure MOA though so I can't give you details like that.  The Bushnell TRS-25 has a 3 MOA dot and holds a zero very well.

ar15,3dwejg,DickheadJesus,0,Mon Jul 20 15:16:50 2015 UTC,I shoot my lantac dragon indoors with no issue with the concussion wave.  I do get some looks because of the noise though.
ar15,3dwejg,GeneUnit90,2,Mon Jul 20 15:23:50 2015 UTC,I have a comp on my rifle upper only because it came free from BCM...didn't even think of this issue  until now. I guess I'm a brass slingin' concussion wave kickin' range dick.
ar15,3dwejg,GeneUnit90,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:04:14 2015 UTC,"It's funny you mention that because a few weeks ago my friend and I were sighting in his new scope on his AR so i knelt down next to the table and I was too far forward, that first shot made me pull back a few inches."
ar15,3dwejg,whitedit,11,Mon Jul 20 15:02:39 2015 UTC,Just apologize and don't worry about it.  If they're seriously bothered by getting hit by brass occasionally they're in the wrong hobby.
ar15,3dwejg,GoldenGuy2,8,Mon Jul 20 03:11:26 2015 UTC,Really? I hate getting hit in the head by brass as I'm aiming down the sights. It breaks my concentration...unless you're implying to use this as a training tool to not allow things like that to break concentration which may in fact be quite helpful during an actual firefight or SHTF situation.
ar15,3dwejg,whitedit,5,Mon Jul 20 03:30:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is annoying, but definitely a good training tool.  The worst is people's brakes that function too good.  Move down the line away from people with that shit."
ar15,3dwejg,GoldenGuy2,3,Mon Jul 20 03:43:22 2015 UTC,"Moving isn't always an option on a full range...or easy when the lanes are assigned in advance.  Frankly, I don't need hot brass flying at me when I am on the range.  I am there to target shoot, not train for a combat situation.  I have that t-shirt already.  I am done with it.  If you want to train for such a situation, take a tactical carbine course.  Simple rules of thumb for the range - be safe and considerate of the others there."
ar15,3dwejg,AndyE34,2,Mon Jul 20 04:25:55 2015 UTC,"I remember my first time shooting last year, I was 13. Dude next to me had a brake on his AR and we were in an inside range, totally turned me off about shooting. Well, now I have $300 to go till I put together one of my own. Totally unrelated but the sentence about  the brakes working too good reminded me."
ar15,3dwejg,corduroyshirt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:16:42 2015 UTC,"Good point.  I considered mentioning that issue too, but I was already going a bit long...and I also knew the chest beating ""toughen up!"" refrain would be the popular direction here.  My wife had a very similar experience to yours.  I brought her to an indoor range several years ago for her first time shooting.  She was very nervous, but the range is the NRA HQ range and normally the folks in each lane are very considerate.   Unfortunately, on this day I had two guys sharing a lane next to us who scared the living shit out of her.  They each had a holstered pistol and a slung AR and were executing rifle to pistol drills as if of they were in Fallujah...with zero downtime.  One of them would speed dump both mags down range and back out for the next one to do the same, and then guy 1 was back in the lane doing it again without switching targets.  Surprisingly (for this range) the RO had no issue, so they were well within their rights to continue, but after 5 minutes my wife was done.  She wanted nothing to do with being there any longer or learning to shoot.  She was almost crying.  Fortunately, there was an empty lane elsewhere and the RO allowed us to move.  An empty lane there is often unusual, but we got lucky.  She eventually settled down and ended up having a great time, but I can't imagine how it would have gone if the guy in the lane to our left was spitting hot brass at her."

Cheap and attaches to the top picatinny rail. I'll try to dig up a link.

Mine had a tendency to kick 1:40 back into the chamber when single round loading. A little bending to adjust it cured that.  A friend added a strip of Velcro to the leading edge for a little more contact.   We use them to localize the cases, you haven't lived until a Garand tosses a hot case up against your head. Good times!"
ar15,3dwejg,tsr6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:41:36 2015 UTC,"Huh, I made one of these myself by welding a piece of metal to an old sling mount. I had that issue first as well, with it knocking it back into the chamber, but I modified it and put the bend further out. This means the shells fly further out before being knocked down, and as a result they don't go back in anymore. Haven'd had a single issue in something like 1000 rounds."
ar15,3dwejg,CantHearYou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:39:10 2015 UTC,I like that a lot better than the brass catcher. Won't even notice it's there and I can easily collect all the brass during a cold line.

I laughed it off - I mean seriously, It's going to happen at some point.  The range I shoot at does have screens you can put up at the rifle range, but sometimes 22LR shells go right through them."
ar15,3dwejg,Meior,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:33:19 2015 UTC,Very true I've even had my own brass go down my shirt while at the indoor range. That's even more annoying
ar15,3dwejg,isbo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:07:54 2015 UTC,"I have the most problems with 22LR brass.  I don't know if it's because of the size or the way they eject on my rifle, but I tend to get 1 round out of every 30 or so that either goes down my shirt or lands on my arm and I have to do the jiggle mid magazine to get it off."

ar15,3dwejg,PriceZombie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:57:34 2015 UTC,"No, but our range is built very similarly. I'm about 100 miles south. As far as I could tell the screen just wasn't tall enough. Most of the brass popped right over the top."
ar15,3dwejg,rafri,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:07:13 2015 UTC,"At the range where I normally go we put up fine chicken net between the stations. We had the same situation as you describe, where the walls were too low. The net works wonders though, as it catches the brass, but avoids creating a concussion-barrel that you get with full walls.   I made a brass deflector of my own, by simply welding an angled piece of metal to an old sling mount I had. This flings the brass down, into the floor."
ar15,3dwejg,rafri,2,Mon Jul 20 14:36:54 2015 UTC,"That's a cool idea, I might have to mention that to them next time I go. I might also mention it may be time to add another 5 lanes or so for each distance."

There's no way people can be expected to change how they shoot to protect others from brass...  flying brass is part of being at the range...  deal with it.

INB4 everyone tells you to build a PSA  edit:.22lr may be cheaper, but the its relatively hard to find currently.

ar15,3dz9yo,BlastedInTheFace,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:41:56 2015 UTC,M&P is a solid choice for a first AR. Learn to shoot irons so you don't have to spend a bunch on a scope and everyone should know how to use iron sights. When you're ready for a scope the Nikon P223 is a solid choice on the cheaper end and is what I just used in my first competition.

ar15,3dv37a,94291,3,Mon Jul 20 13:35:15 2015 UTC,"I know it's difficult to read when it's not specifically highlighted, but here is that quote in context.    In addition, it should be noted the when it comes to optics, the old adage “you get what you pay for” is most definitely true because it costs the manufacturer significantly more to design and produce a high quality optic than it does a cheap one.  However, that does not necessarily mean that you must spend $500 to $1,000 in order to obtain a high quality optic for your rifle!  It simply means that you need to determine what level of performance you require from your optic depending on the use to which you intend to put it and then choose an appropriate price range depending on those requirements."

I sighted through the optic and focused my sight on the primary target. (50m?) Then twist the focus knob until the outer ring is in focus. You'll know because it will be split in two until they focus and come together. Up until then, the 3moa center dot was really fucking my eye over."

The only question is how many layers of wall it will go through. A lightweight, high velocity round like the .223 will lose velocity quickly when it hits something like drywall (or a human body). This means it usually penetrates less than buckshot or handgun rounds.   But they can all be deadly through a wall, which is why the most important thing in houses is to not miss. Again, an AR has an advantage there. In close range it's hard to miss, especially with a red dot or similar optic."

ar15,3duizr,WhatIskarmuh,5,Sun Jul 19 16:41:40 2015 UTC,Do you shoot with both eyes open? That is how red dots should be used.
ar15,3duizr,rafri,2,Sun Jul 19 17:17:03 2015 UTC,"That's what I'd suggest. That and training the non-dominant eye. I focused with that with my pistol for a while shooting with the non dominant hand and eye combo. It's weird at first, but like shooting with both eyes open you get used to it."
ar15,3duizr,number_e1even,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:24:28 2015 UTC,Yes. And my point of impact has been all over the place. I just moved my trs 25 from an ar15 to a 22 to practice. I was trying to Co witness with a pinned a2 site but I couldn't seem to get it to work well.
ar15,3duizr,JakesGunReviews,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:27:50 2015 UTC,"You can't cowitness if you aren't aligning it with a rear sight, too."
ar15,3duizr,SirDunkz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:36:41 2015 UTC,When aiming do you focus on the dot and move it over the target or do you focus on the target and move the dot over it? ie do you look past your dot instead of at the dot?
ar15,3duizr,exile0514,4,Mon Jul 20 18:49:26 2015 UTC,"How well do you shoot with irons? Eye dominance shouldn't really matter for accuracy. As long as the dot is secure to your rifle, you're aiming where you want the bullet go to consistently, and you have your fundamentals of marksmanship down, then they should all be within a 2 inch group. My guess is that you're pulling your shots when you go to pull the trigger.   Shooting with your dominate hand on the end of your rifle will actually improve accuracy if you can get your non-dominate hand to do very well with trigger control. You might want to try practicing on the right side of your rifle if you think that you can get a good trigger pull eventually."
ar15,3duizr,elgrecoski,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:12:07 2015 UTC,I am gray with my 22. And ok with my ar15 on irons. But I have been mostly shooting my spr with a scope and now I'm crap with irons. I am going to try left handed and use the right arm out. I am ambidextrous to an extent. I can write etc with both hands but I favor the right hand from habit.
ar15,3duizr,NetJnkie,4,Mon Jul 20 02:48:55 2015 UTC,If you don't have issues with irons it sounds like you have a loose mount that is shifting under recoil.
ar15,3duizr,NetJnkie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:30:40 2015 UTC,I'll double check thanks.
ar15,3duizr,mutant90,2,Mon Jul 20 02:45:11 2015 UTC,I doubt this is a cross dominance issue.  I'm cross dominate and can shoot red dots at 100 yards fine.  Sure you aren't pulling the shots?  Put the rifle on a rest and try.
ar15,3duizr,The_Joellercoaster,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:33:17 2015 UTC,I'll try it this week. Thanks for the advice. I may have been stressing about lining the dot up with the front sight
ar15,3duizr,Stromkirk_plebeian,3,Mon Jul 20 02:46:22 2015 UTC,"Well there's your problem.  Don't do that.  Depending on your head placement they may not line up but the red dot WILL be on.  If you can see it, it's on.  Just point it and shoot."
ar15,3duizr,hijacked86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:10:47 2015 UTC,"The red dot doesn't line up with anything. You need to sight in your red dot only on the target. The bullet should impact on the dot, no matter where your front or rear sight is."
ar15,3duizr,hijacked86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:10:17 2015 UTC,Mike Pannone is a right-banded shooter who lost his right eye. He put an Eotech on a high mount and title his rifle a bit to the left so that his left eye can pick up the dot. I've tried it with an RMR mounted on top of an ACOG and I can see it work with some training.  Check him out.

ar15,3dqska,SilentRadar,3,Sat Jul 18 23:23:21 2015 UTC,"I haven't shot those but I do have the SSA-E. To be honest, I actually prefer the CMC, it is zero creep with a very crisp break similar to the SSA-E and short reset. You can shoot it really fast. The SSA-E is better for precision shooting though. I'm not sure I'd like the flat bow on a two-stage trigger, so I wouldn't get the sd-e/c, but I'd say this is a good cheaper alternative to the sd-3g."

ar15,3dqska,Mmiklase,3,Sat Jul 18 16:25:30 2015 UTC,How tight is the fit between your your upper and lower? I've heard the gen 1 is usually more snug and preferred over the gen 2. Mine is gen 1 and has just a hair of wobble but it's still tighter than almost every other AR I've handled.
ar15,3dqska,Mmiklase,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:27:06 2015 UTC,"Mine also has a tiny amount of wobble, but it's better than my BCM upper mated to an LMT lower."
ar15,3dqska,Meior,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:37:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it makes me wonder how much a Gen 2 must wobble.   I used the same CMC trigger in mine and have that stock on the way. I'll post a picture or PM you a picture of mine when I'm done which should be by the end of next week. It started out as a factory N4 rifle but all that will be original when I'm done will be the upper, lower, buffer tube, BCG, barrel, and gas system. I don't see any need to replace those items since they're the heart of the Noveske. I'd like to SBR it eventually but I'm just torn about cutting, threading, and crowning the Noveske barrel. Plus, I'm using a rifle length CF Christensen handguard so I'd be putting all of that time/work/money into reducing the overall barrel length by maybe 4"". I'd rather put a can on it instead."

ar15,3ds2om,BlistexMedex,6,Sat Jul 18 23:19:34 2015 UTC,Because pistols can fit into your pocket and become easily concealed. Pistol grip = pistol.  Muzzle devices make the gun silent and turn it into a sniper rifle.  I'm guessing their logic when making those laws makes roughly as much sense as what I just said.

ar15,3dt05t,The_Joellercoaster,3,Sun Jul 19 21:28:17 2015 UTC,"A lot of ranges don't allow steel case ammo because the projectiles associated with those are generally bi-metal.  Bi-metal jackets usually contain steel in the jacket which can cause sparks when they hit some rocks or backstops.  So to prevent range fires, steel case ammo is often banned."
