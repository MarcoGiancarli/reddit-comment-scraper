They all run on different systems. Python is in the middle holding it all together. Clients can come and go quickly so making software live quickly is essential. You could code in any language but developing in Python is fast. I think it's readability and documentation is the main reason for that. The great community is also a big help.  So all those systems I mention. They don't talk and aren't compatible. So I write api's and setup file exchanges (ftp, webdav etc). Then you take one persons format and convert it to anothers.  It's a mix of devops, web development and ETL processing  Flask for webservices. It's trivial to process text files. I've used psycopg2 every day for years now.  Edit: also requests and beautifulsoup for xml - I forget requests I use it every day!"

Tool gathered metrics, inventories of elements and reported back to the performance reporting tool for management. Every manager likes a graph and a table in Excel, so we also provided those.

We have a VERY large network of client and data center network devices. I noticed that we had some very large holes in the way we monitored a network with over 100K+ interfaces.  I built a tool that basically Scrapes automated CLI output from our head end routers and plugs that information into a database. Specifically BGP routing tables and finding the best path to our services from one of our HUBs. This told us what service was being used out of which data center, as we have about 50-100 services that we offer over IPSEC>DMVPN>BGP to our customers.   Django and DRF Paramiko Pysnmp Postgresql Supervisord  After this project I was promoted to Programmer Analyst where I just finished building a application that Builds Client VPN routers to be shipped to colo's, and customers. We have a rack of routers plugged into a rack, that networked up to a console server and a internal router.  The application has a web UI where you build a router configuration through a few ways.   Converting old Cisco router configurations from previous models to our current model (Using CiscoConfParse), building a configuration from scratch, or providing already made configuration. The builder provide shipping and relevant ticket information into the web gui, and it fires off and applies the configuration to the router via FTP. It then audits the configuration and adds anything missed, emails appropriate parties to inform a router is built, and enters all the information into our DataWarehouse.   But in the background while all this is happening, the application is also upgrading default factory routers being put into the rack. Whenever we get a router from Cisco they come with default IOS and can't connect to anything due to network interfaces not being up. The application's background process audits all of this information for every router that is plugged in on a timed schedule and upgrades IOS and sets a base configuration for FTP capability accordingly. Once the background process sees this done the router is now in a pool of available routers for configuration, perpetual router replacement/upgrades/installs are the outcome.  All built via Python. I'm a one man show as well, as I'm the only programmer in my department of about 70 people. Tired. So tired."

Python,3e239y,_ben_lowery,2,Tue Jul 21 16:40:46 2015 UTC,"One of three developers in a consultancy, we build a variety of things for clients - primarily webapps with some kind of more complex / custom element, often along with all the operations etc that go with it. For most tasks we use a library built on top of flask.  Examples of things we've done recently:   A web application that enables online real-time video and audio doctor appointments in your web browser and mobile application. This was particularly interesting due to the need to control the real-time sessions (made some use of Node.JS and gevent), along with all the client-side stuff (React, WebRTC etc), and significant security and privacy requirements (keeping all the data in jurisdiction, making pentesters sad because they can't find holes). A powerful system for importing, interpreting, charting and presenting open government data. This one was particularly interesting because the information you get from ""open govt"" stuff is all over the place, excel files in all kinds of weird forms with bold here and random date method there. Our system provides a client-side interface that lets the data analyst ""paint"" the spreadsheet info in order to assist the system in pulling it in with the correct types and annotations, and another client-side system for WYSIWYG chart design. There's a pile of API stuff in there too. Oh, and some crazy SVG stuff to make the charts look great at any res. A maritime broadcasting system that turns bulletins into speech and broadcasts the result to various ocean areas for shipping. This one was challenging because of the wide variety of designed-for-humans text that was sent to the platform via email, which needed to be robustly  interpreted, cleaned up, then provided in a useful fashion for the operators to be able to shuffle the bulletins around and provide last minute edits, before finally composing the results including use of IPA for correct pronunciation of place names etc. Made use of a grammar parser (parsley I think) for this one for one or two of the emails that were just too complex for regex. Also had some C code to get the TTS engine doing what it was supposed to do sensibly, and more React on the front-end. Operations assist for a larger org using GCS - some interesting scripting around ansible to help create/manage clusters of servers and services including code deployment etc. Some puppet and supervisord in there too. This one was challenging particularly because the org was moving very quickly and requirements were definitely in flux the entire time.

The backend to process and count/aggregate/analize these events is written in Python.  We rely heavily on gevent to make sure none of our IO causes blocking and in some inner loop code on the analytics side we use cython. We process >10k requests per second at peak and can run fairly efficient queries on the resulting time series data using an analytics pipeline also entirely written in python served through a flask app. For unittest and smoketests we use py.test.  There are of course allot of mundane tasks related to parsing csv files or server ops/deployments, but there are also many interesting computer science problems to solve, especially on the analytics side and doing performance and memory optimization.

Altering this behavior would require metaclass hacking, which should generally be avoided if you don't have a good reason for it.  You have heavy lifting that converts user-supplied data to your internal format. You dislike putting this code in __init__(). I can understand that, but it doesn't mean it's a bad design.  You could factor your heavy lifting into a separate data conversion method and call it from __init__(). This has the benefit that it'll also be reusable in other situations besides initialization. You could also make a classmethod that does the conversion and returns a new instance, e.g. MyClass.from_userdata(data). In that case, __init__() would be very minimal, accepting data that has already been preprocessed.  I wouldn't advise going too crazy with your __init__() signature.

As for current design, yes the heavy lifting is indeed factored out into its own sundered _method, but what I want to avoid is the heavier signature and necessary branching and exception raising to only conditionally call the heavy lifting _method, and I believe, with your confirmation above, that I can suitably do this by just calling MyClass.__new__ where I don't need the initializaiton done in other methods, as opposed to messing with __init__.

I wouldn't have thought to use __new__() to intentionally bypass __init__(). The user of your class shouldn't generally have to know whether to construct the class, or reach into a dunder method to obtain it another way.  But it would be fair game to wrap (or alias) __new__() in a non-dunder classmethod that advertises what it does differently from __init__(). This still gives you the advantage of offloading the conditional logic that would otherwise be in __init__() on to the user, but without the user being aware of the implementation details of the two methods for construction. (Even if that user is just you. ;) )  As I mentioned above, I think it's better to have __init__() and __new__() do very little work, and make a separate classmethod that returns a newly constructed instance using the heavy-lifting preprocessing."

Don't do some dark magic to make an instance without calling your __init__. Just do the plain, simple thing.  But that isn't the API I want to provide, you might say. Clearly, though, your API wasn't the design that reflected reality reflected in Python or it would have been easier to write.

With thoughtful indices and reasonable timeouts wrapped into the connection object, sqlite is quite capable of handling a   heavy workload. Of course it's not going to scale to handle massive levels and any site with the potential to become very large and busy should look for a scalable solution, but if your site is only handling a dozen simultaneous users accessing a few million rows sqlite would work just fine.   That said, it's always fun to learn something new and having postgres under your belt would be a good skill to have.

Python,3e2b4a,tim_martin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:15 2015 UTC,"Quoting from http://sqlite.com/whentouse.html:   SQLite works great as the database engine for most low to medium traffic websites (which is to say, most websites). The amount of web traffic that SQLite can handle depends on how heavily the website uses its database. Generally speaking, any site that gets fewer than 100K hits/day should work fine with SQLite. The 100K hits/day figure is a conservative estimate, not a hard upper bound. SQLite has been demonstrated to work with 10 times that amount of traffic.  The SQLite website (https://www.sqlite.org/) uses SQLite itself, of course, and as of this writing (2015) it handles about 400K to 500K HTTP requests per day, about 15-20% of which are dynamic pages touching the database. Each dynamic page does roughly 200 SQL statements. This setup runs on a single VM that shares a physical server with 23 others and yet still keeps the load average below 0.1 most of the time.   There are of course limitations: http://sqlite.com/faq.html#q5, but your hard statement is incorrect."

Things like Nuitka and Cython (c-compilers) turn your script into machine code which is compilation. Although this can be reverse engineered (nothing is fool proof), it's much, much harder.  The idea behind using nuitka and cx-freeze together, is that you compile as much of your code as possible using nuitka. Then have a main py file that imports the compiled pyd modules.

Python,3dx91g,stepwn,33,Mon Jul 20 19:27:34 2015 UTC,"py2exe is only for windows but it worked ok in the past. it basically zips bytecode+native modules for distribution.

It also zips bytecode+native modules. nuitka is whole another beast. it translates python code into c++ code which calls into libpythonXX (pythonXX.dll on windows). It does not provide much speedup yet however it completely hides your code so it cant be decompiled. Resulting c++ and then machine code is by far less meaningful than python bytecode. It also is VERY compliant but some things may break. This is not the case with py2exe and cx_freeze.

On the other hand, if you are interesting in speeding up Python for performance reasons, then you should look into Nuitka, Pyrex or Cython class of tools.

Compiling a python application into a 'distributable' is prone to all kinds of failures, typically:   Linking to external system library that the bundler doesn't detect Accessing path and attempting to read assets embedded in the library (eg. templates) Failure to parse 'complex' dependencies with shared namespaces (eg. zope.anything). Dependency on some kind of system python being installed for the standard library or libpython. Built target is a specific arch; eg. x86_64 or i386 on mac, when you want a universal binary.   To be fair, they all try to sort it out, but it can be a mixed bag. It's not uncommon to bundle an application and have it 'all working except for <insert package here>...' and spend a few fruitless hours hunting google for configuration settings and tips to resolve the issue.  Honestly, unless you really need to, you'll be saving yourself a heck of a lot of hassle by not going down this path at all.  Do you really need a standalone distributable?  If all you need is to share your code around, using pip and 'install python locally and then pip install foo' is a much much better solution to your problem.  Python isn't made for this purpose and although its not ... completely terrible at it, it's not really what python shines at.  You know the adage; toolbox, tools. Pick best for purpose. If you're building a standard alone distributable application that you don't want to share the source code to (eg. a game), python isn't really the best choice for it."

Basically, I'm using it to extract informations from Python scripts.  1st example: Let's say I'd like to get all requirements of a Python library. The following command returns to me everything passed through the setup() function, which contains the ""install_requires"" keyword that I can use to extract that information.  python -m pyintercept setup.py setuptools.setup --handler=pyintercept.print  {'cmdclass': {'test': <class __main__.PyTest at 0x1078e5460>}, 'name': 'pyintercept', 'license': 'MIT', 'author': 'Caio Ariede', 'author_email': 'caio.ariede@gmail.com', 'include_package_data': True, 'url': 'http://github.com/caioariede/pyintercept', 'version': '0.2', 'zip_safe': False, 'platforms': ['any'], 'install_requires': ['byteplay'], 'packages': ['pyintercept', 'pyintercept.handlers'], 'test_suite': 'py.test', 'classifiers': ['Intended Audience :: Developers', 'Operating System :: OS Independent', 'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License', 'Programming Language :: Python', 'Programming Language :: Python :: 3', 'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.4'], 'tests_require': ['pytest'], 'description': 'Intercept function calls from Python scripts'}   2nd example: Let's say I'd like to get the path to a settings file used by a certain Django project. I wrote the following handler:  File intercept_settings.py:  def x(*args, **kwargs):     import os     print os.environ[""DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE""]   That I use to replace the function used by Django to handle commands:  python -m pyintercept manage.py django.core.management.execute_from_command_line --handler=intercept_settings.x   This outputs:  myproject.settings   How does that work?  Under the hood, pyintercept reads and modifies the compiled bytecode of the script, replacing the function you passed by parameter with your own function. From there you can manipulate the code the way you want."

Python,3e02l0,AeroNotix,2,Mon Jul 20 23:18:39 2015 UTC,"To try and answer your specific question, it might be your formatting but do you have two on_data methods? Could that be your problem?  Otherwise, some other tips:   numpy.isnan to check for NaNs. Also you can use boolean masks to filter NaNs out faster: data = data[~numpy.isnan(data)]. Don't switch between lists and numpy arrays so much. You can probably get by with just numpy arrays. Learn the methods that go along with that (concatenate, etc). Do something different with the if 0 in my_list. Unless I'm misunderstanding it, just check if the value being added is 0 and if so don't add it. Adding it and then removing is a waste of time. If it's not just the element being added then using numpy arrays would make it simple to mask it out similar to #1. Usually when I'm making realtime dashboards I try not to have an ever expanding list of data points. Usually it makes sense to keep the last N number of points. If you need to have it grow forever then nevermind. Writing to a file is another option if you want to do statistics later.   Edit:  Another thought, you could preallocate a larger array in numpy every where needed and fill it in as you go, expanding it when needed. If you fill it with NaNs and use numpy.nanmean and similar for your calculations you should be fine. I don't believe matplotlib plots NaNs in line plots. I understand that performance might not be important to you right now...but better to future proof when it's easier."

Python,3dyihh,remy_porter,2,Mon Jul 20 16:13:50 2015 UTC,"I guess I should be a bit more pedantic: an RDBMS doesn't guarantee the order of the data unless you use an ORDER BY clause in your select. Depending on the underlying implementation and the class of table (some RDBMSes support Index-Organized-Tables) the storage of the data might be in order, and the default behavior of a SELECT statement will then extract the data in the correct order. It is not, however, a guarantee, and if you want the data sorted, you should always just use an ORDER BY."

Python,3dt1i9,CekoDeko,6,Sun Jul 19 10:58:47 2015 UTC,"I occasionally give some thought to this.  Pros:  Expressing data-related logic in the database is often the simplest way. WHEREs are explicitly designed to select subsets of rows, so handling access control with that is natural.   If you express it in the database, it's much easier to be consistent- once you restrict access to a table, it's protected from all angles- if you implement this in your webapp, there are many ways to do it which leave data protected in some ways and unprotected in other- it's hard to do it 100% right.  At some point, you could provide users SQL access- it's the ultimate API. People will run away screaming if I mention this, but it would be great to be able to do this securely. APIs are sucky for reporting and bulk data modification- SQL is AWESOME for that kind of stuff.  Cons.  Frameworks do not support this, so you would have to roll your own.  You cannot do FKs in your tables to the user table, so you have to jump through hoops to simulate that (I think you can now trigger on CREATE USER, so it should be possible to implement this reasonably well).  Well, it's not the beaten path. There is bound to be hidden downsides and unthought of use cases. Here be dragons and all that.    I'm a firm proponent of using databases to their full extent, and I think it'd be nifty to investigate this."
Python,3dt1i9,andrewcooke,2,Sun Jul 19 09:50:32 2015 UTC,"Like so many things in the programming world the answer is ""it depends"". I'll give an example of a single ERP I saw once. This wasn't a multi-tenanted environment either. It was only multi-user. Originally, it used an Informix database which (like Postgres) implemented row locking at the table level. Then the company decided to also support Microsoft SQL but they never took into consideration that MS SQL implements locking at the query level (e.g. SELECT * FROM BLAH WITH(NOLOCK) or UPDATE BLAH SET SOMETHING=1 WITH(ROWLOCK)). Like somebody else said, it worked well... until it didn't. Nothing worse than the billing people doing a mass update that pretty much locked everyone else out from doing updates because MS SQL tries to be ""smart"" if you don't specify the locking level and randomly decided it needed a TABLELOCK.   Having said that, you'd need to say more about the specific scenario before anyone could make a judgement call either way. Offhand though, I'd say there's no harm in the idea of row locking if you have a significant amount of data that needs to be shared between more than a couple of users."

By the way, using select.select() you need to redefine the file descriptor array only when you add ore remove a file descriptor from the set of the one you are monitoring."

However, there are a number of bugs, plus some I'm sure I haven't found yet, that can be encountered in some places. There are also features that are missing or incomplete compared to p4a before the rewrite, although there are also a number of important new ones.   but is it production ready?   Not really, I made the announcement because it's developer ready if anyone is interested, particularly if they want to use the new features. This is probably of most interest to anyone already using or considering  using python-for-android to compile kivy apps, or just generally interested in the progress of different ways to put python on android.   Is mainly for games?   It's for creating Android projects and APKs containing Python, not for any specific task. Kivy is the main supported backend for now, which is quite good for games (in my opinion, better than pygame in many ways), but is a general ui framework that does other things too. However, one of the goals is to make it more usable for other projects; I noted that Vispy already works, and I'd like to try some other things like a flask/webview backend."

If you meant ""Python interpreter"" where you wrote ""shell"", then that's true — not every computer comes with a Python interpreter.  But that's irrelevant in the context of a virus.  A virus is a specific class of malware where you run the program and it spreads itself.  If you are able to run a Python script then by definition you already have a Python interpreter on your computer.  That is the only way for a virus to spread.  If you're referring to other kinds of malware that spread without the user explicitly running a program, then you aren't talking about a virus.  But that's also irrelevant, because you can always bundle a Python interpreter with your script to create a standalone executable.  Malware is generally downloaded by a loader, so you would have your initial exploit and then it would download a bunch of other stuff, and one of those things could be a bundled Python interpreter+script."

A tuple of base classes (haven't seen if any other iterable works) A dict mapping names to attributes/methods   So, we could take this:  g = dict(globals()) for e in g: if callable(g[e]) and e != 'MyClass': setattr(MyClass, e, g[e])   And do this instead:  # MyClass doesn't exist yet. clsdct = {k: v for k, v in globals().items() if callable(v)} MyClass = type('MyClass', (object,), clsdct)   Now you have a class.

If you were to display pre-rendered images, I would start out with PyGame and see if it is sufficient. If that is not fast enough, I would try step it up with OpenGL, but OpenGL 3.x is very poorly supported by Python, so you would probably end up using the legacy OpenGL 2.1. The last resort will be to write a C++/OpenGL solution, which can be a bit tricky when you're used to Python, but it would be the ideal solution performance wise.

Right now I'm processing a couple billion records a day with it, anticipating getting to 20-100 billion a day eventually.  It works best where:   you have high volumes and don't want to pay licensing costs for ETL servers or additional database servers. you want to distribute some of your extract processes onto multiple machines, colocating them to keep extract times to a minimum complex transforms that are a nightmare with an ETL tool complex aggregations that aren't generally possible, or are painfully slow with a database you need to interface with new libraries, services and frameworks too new to be supported by an ETL tool you already have good programmers you want the most code reusability you want test-driven development, or at least high coverage of unit-tests   ETL tools generally simplify the easiest 80-90% of ETL work, but tend to drive away the best programmers.   So, that leaves you kind of screwed for that last 10-20% of ETL work.   Python allows you to do the entire job and keep the best programmers.   About the only time I would stick with an ETL tool is when it's already a department/corporate std, you've got a huge pool of developers experienced with it, and it meets your performance needs at a price you can afford.

About the only time I would stick with an ETL tool is when it's already a department/corporate std,   I was very happy with Ab Initio.

Python,3dkwri,metaperl,2,Fri Jul 17 22:16:50 2015 UTC,"How do you speedily process high volumes of data in CPython? Are you using Luigi or Airflow? What is the your multiple processor programming tool of choice in Python?   In data warehousing (or most big data analytical databases) most of your feeds aren't large, and only a few are really huge.  In those cases, I'll typically:   extract every 5-10 minutes run my transforms in parallel - threading, multiprocessing (better), or just run a number of instances of the program within the OS.   4-16x native cpython speedup isn't bad. build event-driven daemons rather than schedule based on clock time.  Between this and curating your content rather than having 20 people building in parallel without coordination there's typically little need for an orchestration tool. pay attention to typical python performance gotchas pay attention to hot spots and problem areas be prepared to build caches use cython, pypy, nuitka, etc.   I'm using pypy for about a 50% speed-up and it works great.    While it's true that I have to spend more time thinking about performance than if I was writing code in c, java, etc - it's also true that Python is quick enough to write code in that I can try a couple of different approaches to a problem.  If one doesn't work, I'll refactor it and try another approach - that may be far faster.    For example, recently I was loading about 10,000 files a day into a specific table on Cloudera Impala - and it was taking forever.  Just too much overhead for each load, and these were mostly small files.   So, I added a small daemon between the transform and the loader, and I had this program simply concatenate many small files into a much smaller number of files.  My load time decreased by about 99%.   This concatenator was designed, written, tested and deployed in a day.   I used Ab Initio for 1.5 years. It could handle everything I could throw at it. When it couldn't I could write a component in Python.   That's just it - you will hit a point where the ETL tool can't handle a transform, and at that point you need to write custom code.   changed data capture using file-images   Thanks - you're right about that, I removed that entry.  What I intended to say here is that tooling like Python makes it easy to write small, easily-deployable utiliities.  I have, for example, deployed a small agent to many remote machines to handle data extracts - without any licensing costs.  I have also built small utilities that work far better than typical solutions for things like Changed Data Capture.  And by file-images what I mean is that my solution compares file snapshots."

The only issue I had was SQL Server Agent scheduling crapping out when there were more than 1000 jobs executing with numerous dependencies across the whole solution. In that case Control-M was a godsend. Anyhow, all ETL frameworks are pretty much the same and in principle designed for business folks.

There is zero chance of a subscriber doing something that will fail because the publisher failed a database transaction but added a message to a queue anyway, no race conditions, etc.  Doing things in the database removes a whole set of potential mistakes that programmers can make, people should take advantage of their DB engines more and stop using them purely as a dumb datastore."

The content was good too, didn't even know PostgreSQL implemented PUBSUB.  BUT ... this RESTSockets ""pattern"" is just bonkers. WebSockets are not REST, they are not cacheable and it's debatable whether statelessness is a property that applies here. It's okay though! REST was never supposed to solve everything. It can't. So sometimes it's really fine to use RPC or in this case the observer pattern."

Someone subscribed to /api/todos/ is getting a different set of messages than someone subscribed to /api/todos/foobar/.  (The latter is filtered down to just the messages relevant to that ID).  In a larger app, where you might have a separate Postgres channel per table, this would be even more pronounced. The app may be running as multiple processes behind a load balancer.  We can't share a Postgres connection between separate processes.   Within those constraints, you're right.  We could open up a listener to the todos table on startup on a background thread/greenlet, then have some kind of in-process pubsub that each websocket handler could connect to.  I might look into that."

You said something along the lines of using rabbitMQ to fan out the messages. I have a couple of doubts regarding that   So am I right in thinking that rabbitMQ will be a layer between the db and the websockets ?  They'll be published to notifications from the queue and the ajax calls ot update the db will go through our app through regular channels ?    I'm goinig to clone the code and have a look at how you integrated websockets with react and using gevent as both of those are things that I have been meaning to learn more about lately."

Now Open Source projectdom is a crazy array of forums, and tools, and websites; one never knows which tool is the current 'vogue' and actually has someone paying attention to it.

The only APIs you need to learn from Bottle would be how to use their router, the serve function, and how to use a request object.  With Django I need to learn how to use their bootstrapping tools, their ORM, their templating system, how to install other modules (i.e. maybe I only need a REST API, gotta learn Django REST), how to navigate the file/folder structure, and more.

Python,3ddp26,tipsqueal,6,Thu Jul 16 04:16:03 2015 UTC,"Django REST framework does lots of sophisticated things, like    pretty views of your API endpoints if you visit them in a browser providing helpers for converting django Model objects to their JSON representations — and applying updates from a REST PUT to be saved back to your model this includes objects that may be composed of other sub-objects views that apply to lists of objects, including pagination, i.e. if you have an API that may return 1000s of results but you want the client to be able to ask for only 50 at a time rate limiting API authentication   ...basically a ton of things that aren't necessary for a minimal API, but if you start building out a REST API for a lot of objects you're going to be writing a lot of code that looks very much the same for many of the views, and that's the code that's gone in to Django REST framework."
Python,3ddp26,keturn,8,Thu Jul 16 05:53:00 2015 UTC,The experience of writing a REST API in Django using only the bare minimum is the same as writing a REST API in a microframework. The experience of building a REST API with Django and django-rest-framework improves on both.

In fact, it's evident of the original statement that learning Django teaches you just Django.  It's wrong that you have to learn Django Rest Framework to write a rest API.  But that is indicative that how Django works is not immediately clear--because it's not obvious how one would do that, the quick reaction is to rely on some third party extension to the framework.  So it's a misunderstanding, but that misunderstanding does stem from Django's complexity."

For a person already doing that, or for a person who already knows Django it will almost always be easier for them to continue to use Django right away for a new project, and there is nothing wrong with that.  The harm that I see is that Django is always being thrown around as the one and only framework to use when using Python (like Rails is with Ruby), but Django is so big, and has so many options available that it can be very paralyzing to a new programmer.  The other problem I see with Django (when it comes to new programmers) is that you learn how to program with Django, not how to program with Python. I've seen this in interviews where I interview someone who is an ""expert Python programmer with 5 years+ experience"", when in reality all they've memorized is the Django APIs, and they've let Django do all the heavy lifting. Now if I task them with a programming problem even marginally difficult they can't do it, because they're not used to programming outside of the Django world. It's basically the problem people have with jQuery developers."

Then a couple of days ago, I just got so fed up with how unorganised everything was that I gave up, copied all the templates and static files into a new directory, and rewrote the whole thing in CherryPy.  It took, what, a day to get to the same functionality, two days to add a bunch of features that I had been shying away from writing.  I haven't really played around with these sorts of things much, but to me I love the fact that CherryPy feels more like a library than a full framework.  I build the app how I like it, make sure it exposes an API somewhere that CherryPy can understand, and then put one inside the other.  I mean, sure, it's still very definitely still a framework when I need to be aware of threads and how it will go about running my app, but in terms of actually sitting down and thinking about how the app should look on the inside - I feel completely free to do that exactly how I want."

Python,3ddp26,Neceros,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:31:58 2015 UTC,"Bottle is much more minimalistic than Flask. For starters, it's just one file that can be dropped in a project folder, it has no other dependencies.  It even contains a simple template engine, one more sensible to my mind than, say, Jinja, in that it doesn't define its own Python-ish template language, but just uses Python, which already is a very good templating language.  Very convenient for small stand-alone sites - can just copy a couple of files to a server and done, no installation needed. Very convenient for embedding a small webserver in a larger program.    For its small size and compactness, Bottle is very configurable and can plug in anything required, just like Flask - any template engine or WSGI middleware.  Bottle is why I wouldn't call Flask a microframework - Flask in itself is already a library with ~20 files, and it still requires Werkzeug, Jinja or another template engine, and a few other packages still. If all that adds up to ""micro"", then Bottle must be a picoframework :)"

I was trying to use a tool called TileMill (based on Mapnik) to view the data, but it was ridiculously slow and required tons of setup just to get to the map. I went through this whole tutorial and had the city map showing up, but was unable to get my own custom markers to display properly.  For reference, this is what I'm hoping to fine. The google maps iOS SDK does exactly what I need. You just set the location on the map and can start adding markers with custom lables and GPS positions.

I learned the hardest part is to actually get useful data, not writing the algo / the simulation, in particular when you aim at fast responses ( << 1 minute ) to the market, not just the daily open, close, high and low.

A simplified notation in which indicators and/or numeric values can be compared to each other helps also.  Providing a ""realistic"" broker implementation was one of the goals to ensure the platform user doesn't have to deal with the overhead of price matching and pnl calculations.

Python,3df2lu,vishnu_gupt,5,Wed Jul 15 19:41:19 2015 UTC,I work in company making Odoo ERP's for clients. Odoo is very hard comparing to Django and Flask. It's completly not pythonic with poorly written modules by different people with different skills. It's full of bugs after clean installation and it's very heavy.

Also, with its new ""proprietary"" turn, I think its community is going to turn toxic and anybody not following in the ""Enterprise"" (proprietary) package is going to get burned. You don't want to assume maintainership of a fork of that shitty codebase, so you'll have to abide to whatever new scheme OpenERP S.A. comes up with.

Python,3df2lu,nahrub,3,Thu Jul 16 16:52:55 2015 UTC,"For manufacturing, Odoo wins as it has dedicated modules for manufacturing and has more comprehensive modules for other areas of operations (for example warehouse management).  As far as customization - these apps are not at all like django or flask. They have comprehensive developer APIs. You are quite limited to what you can customize as you are working in a restricted sandbox.  In terms of learning curve - erpnext has a more loosely coupled API (frappe) which you can use to build custom modules; it is a lot easier to get started with. Odoo (as it has a longer history) has a steeper learning curve, but the rewards are plentiful as you have the ability to map almost any business process into the system.  Frappe (API framework for erpnext) has a more modern layout - integration is done with standard Python modules that are bootstrapped using their own toolkit (called bench). It also uses Jinja which you would be familiar with if you are a Flask user.  Documentation - Odoo has very comprehensive and detailed documentation covering every aspect of the considerable framework.

Python,3dd8i0,fijal,5,Wed Jul 15 10:34:20 2015 UTC,"Wow, vmprof is really great and done in a pretty clever way. Now I have an idea and need an advice:  One thing I always missed is Linux perf tool's (http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html) support for Python frames, i.e. it's capable of showing C function names and stack traces, but not Python's. perf normally samples RIP address, but is also capable of sampling process stack contents. This makes me wonder if it's possible to modify perf and vmprof, so that Python function names are nicely displayed. It would work this way:   One needs to run Python app with vmprof (so cpyprof_PyEval_EvalFrameEx is in place) cpyprof_PyEval_EvalFrameEx stores co_name (in a local buffer like char co_name[64]), co_firstlineno and co_filename on stack instead of pointer to PyFrameObject like now (volatile PyFrameObject *f2 = f;). This has some impact on performance and recursion limit, but may be acceptable for many people. (Alternatively Python could maintain id mapping for all code objects and save /tmp/perf-pid.map files, like it's done in Java case: https://github.com/jrudolph/perf-map-agent. This way only integer ids would have to be stored on stack) If PyEval_EvalFrameEx is executing when perf record samples it, all required information will be saved with stack sample and available for offline visualisation and analysis (this requires patching tools like perf report).   This may be a bad plan. Do you see something obviously wrong above?"
Python,3dd8i0,ENOENT,3,Wed Jul 15 17:57:21 2015 UTC,"what's wrong with just using vmprof? No, that's a serious question (vmprof also captures the C stack, so if you need you can display it). It can also understand pypy which you may or may not care about and/or other VMs in the future.  On the slightly unrelated note, getting an official patch to cpython would be wonderful (but since it will not get to 2.7, we're stuck with patching stuff)"
Python,3dd8i0,ENOENT,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:07:16 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with vmprof, I'd just love to have both vmprof and perf. One thing I like about perf is that it can act globally on all processes: perf top for example will show all hot functions in the system (including kernel). Same with perf record -a. I find it very useful in practice and I wish I could see real Python functions there (not just PyEval_EvalFrameEx).  For profiling a particular Python app, vmprof is definitely enough."

For now the DAT parsing is only fully featured when using TOSEC files but any files following the same format should still mostly work. I wrote the parser against the TOSEC naming convention rules but I recently noticed they updated them (which they dont do much) so I'll probably have to see what changes that will require.  I'll also likely add the ability to scan a directory full of roms and export/generate a similarly compatible DAT file.  edit: I should mention, I started all this by focusing on N64 DATs and Roms but I've since passed NES/SNES/MegaDrive and any big DATs like some of the C64 ones in and have only had to make very minor tweaks to suss out some of the records that fell through the cracks.  That said... the TOSEC ""language"" tagging rules are atrocious and forced me to build a ludicrous python module that determines the ""primary"" language of a region based on a few different sources of data. Because someone thought it was a great idea to assume that rom filenames without a language tag would be of the ""primary language"" of the tagged region, without realizing there is no such official thing in many places, and no one official data source on that either. (I probably went off the deep end doing that as most roms DO come from regions that have a reasonably guessable ""primary"" language). TOSEC would be wise to just force language tagging on all roms. Here's hoping the new naming convention changes some of this. I dubbed this module ""RegionLang"" heh, may put it on github if I can read the code again and determine its not just a bunch of terrible ideas :)"

Python,3d9ge9,rzet,5,Tue Jul 14 20:48:34 2015 UTC,I use the included QtDesigner app and find it far superior to manually creating the UI in code. I understand the code it generates (its actually very instructive in that way) and frequently find myself making minor UI code edits in it to test things out but ultimately I do all UI design and UI polishing in the tool.
Python,3d9ge9,nfojones,2,Tue Jul 14 21:13:49 2015 UTC,You can use Qt Designer (free using ubuntus*) and then just export save the file and you can import it to your code.

Python,3d9ge9,EscritorDelMal,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:43:07 2015 UTC,Nice job. How many roms do you manage with this program?
Python,3d9ge9,nfojones,6,Tue Jul 14 18:03:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Its been a while since I had it up and running but it will scan all roms in a folder without issue. If its doing CRC checks its relatively fast if its doing MD5 or more it will take a few minutes. Other management tools tend to work off zipped/grouped roms which is not something I'm interested in despite the CRC calc savings offered by that method.   What I really discovered was that feeding a QTreeWidget with 1000s of records will quickly slow the update/scan to a crawl. Part of this was the routine to update the progress bar (and run the animated gif) but after profiling more and reworking that as much as I could I determined that adding 10,000+ QTreeWidgetItems ""live"" is still very slow. The solution was to only make the items visible in the widget after the scan had completed. Now when you scan the DAT/Rom views show a loading image while the progress bar runs and shows the # of roms (or DAT records being scanned). While I enjoyed watching the scan add records in realtime the time savings were massive and now a DAT scan completes much faster (as it should, its just text parsing).  What I can say for sure is, having an animated icon and accurate progress bar can really introduce bottlenecks. Turns out animated icons/images in PyQT is one of its weak spots. I briefly experimented with running the animation in a separate thread but I recall that producing new challenges I didn't have time to overcome.  The workflow is to scan a DAT file, then scan your collected roms, incoming roms or both and then reconcile based on proposed actions and your own settings. I'm basically at hte ""reconcile"" step but kept making rounds touching up each feature set. I think i'm scared that as soon as it works E2E I'll never want to pick it up again.  Which is why there is endianeness handling and CIC detection, etc.  Ultimately the idea for this app was to more easily be able to stay in sync with TOSEC (maybe No-Intro too) DATs and verify the roms in my collection against a newly sourced batch while also providing a good interface to build a rom-filled SD card for use in a flashcart.  This is another reason the zip side of rom management is uninteresting to me as the Everdrive line of carts can't handle zip files (or at least my Mega Everdrive can't nor can my N64 flash cart)"

Python,3d9ge9,justphysics,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:35:48 2015 UTC,"Hmm. That's neat. That's also pretty large for graphene; what kind do you use?. What's the application, if you don't mind going into detail?"
Python,3d9ge9,kirwi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:45:55 2015 UTC,its a pvd process - graphene is easy to grow on ruthenium - Ru has a relatively high carbon solubility and the solubility is temperature dependent. So you can deposit C on the surface with a normal PVD process via a hot carbon filament. Then annealing the Ru crystal will segregate interstitial carbon atoms to the surface. Eventually the amorphous C adatoms on the surface will form into graphene islands.  The application will eventually be to study molecular self assembly atop the graphene islands. Graphene on Ru has a neat corrugated structure making it ideal for growth of periodic arrays of molecules like organic semiconductors
Python,3d9ge9,justphysics,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:47:55 2015 UTC,How are you getting segregation from an anneal given what you just said before (that Ru has high carbon solubility w/ temperature dependance)? Seems sort of counter-intuitive
Python,3d9ge9,mixedCase_,2,Wed Jul 15 04:53:40 2015 UTC,"The temperature dependence of the carbon solubility is interesting for ruthenium.  At elevated but still relatively low (compared to the Ru melting point) the carbon solubility drops significantly such that carbon atoms in solution with the bulk crystal will begin to segregate to the surface of the crystal. This happens in the ball-park of 800-900 ˚C.  At higher temperatures however, the solubility raises significantly such that surface adatoms and graphene islands can be re-adsorbed into the bulk  This process, which may be unique to the Ru-C interaction - allows graphene to be grown in a fairly reproducible manner atop the Ru surface. This can be easily seen in a LEEM experiment where you can actually watch (image) the graphene growth in real time as a function of temperature.  However, the Ru-C bond strength is relatively strong in comparison to the interaction between graphene and other metals. This means that the first layer of graphene is quite strongly bound to the substrate and its electronic properties are more metallic in nature. Only the second layer to grow then becomes closer to the electronic properties of 'free--standing graphene'"

It ended up being extremely useful to use side-by-side with his program to analyze high stress areas or specific structure. He's trying to implement it in his program now (neither of us know squat about each others language).   This was my first stab at a larger gui application.

When you suddenly need to do that, you may make a one off tool and/or implement it poorly.  Basically, I was annoyed by a half finished library.

I'm currently in the process of rewriting my IRC bot from scratch, but enough of it is already there to give you an idea of how it works.  Seshet uses a custom fork of the python-ircutils package as its base and pydal for its database abstraction. I've named the ircutils fork ""ircutils3"" to differentiate it from the original, which only ran on Python 2.  The bot is capable of connecting to any number of channels on a given IRC server and has event handlers for a number of different IRC commands. When the bot receives a message from the server, ircutils3 parses it into an Event object. Events are then passed to the event dispatcher, which passes the Event to the appropriate handler(s) depending on its contents.  Most of the default handlers in Seshet call SeshetBot.log() (or at least they will when I get around to writing it). You can see that log() itself is pretty simple, just inserting a row in the event_log table. Some fields in the table are repurposed depending on the type of event being logged. The event handlers themselves pass attributes of the Event object they're handling, e, to log() as its parameters.  The actual database connection is made before the bot is instantiated, and I'd recommend checking pydal's documentation for details on how that works. Note that in order to use the bot with the database, the event_log table will have to be defined first. Currently, neither test.py nor seshet/config.py are set up to do that. You're welcome to try defining it before instantiating the bot yourself using pydal's documentation and log() as a reference.  <promotion id=""self"" class=""shameless"">Eventually, Seshet will have a bunch of cool features, including dynamically loaded command modules, task scheduling (e.g. for checking RSS feeds), and an optional web-based (using Pyramid) admin interface for checking logs, changing settings, starting/stopping bots, and viewing statistics. Please follow the github project if you're interested!</promotion>"

Sometimes it's more about using the right tools for the job.  Logstash (JRuby) has an irc plugin and you can use filters, tags, and other analysis on the fly to store this into mysql, elasticsearch or even just stdout.  Personally, if you are doing textual analysis I would highly recommend elasticsearch as your target output.  There are great python bindings for it to perform searches and aggregations.  With the additional meta you are able to add during ingestion of the messages you can perform more data analysis.

Python,3denuq,wololongong,2,Wed Jul 15 23:05:57 2015 UTC,"Bitwise operators are useful when you have a set of flags whose values are independent of each other, and you want to be able to perform operations like intersection and union on them. For example, say you have a function f(p) with a flag A, flag B and flag C. Represent each one by a power of 2, so let A be 1, B be 2, and C be 4. If you want to call f with A and C, you simply do f(1 | 4). Inside f, to check if A is set, evaluate bool(p & 1) . To check if C is set, do bool(p & 4) .  The alternative would be to pass a set object as p and check membership of that set, but using flags is much faster and has a minimal memory footprint. This pattern is used in the re library for example.   Sorry if this is unclear, I typed it on my phone."

To do anything creative you will need to understand how to manipulate the Numpy arrays of samples returned by these libraries. I'm sure there are tutorials available for this on Google.  It might also be useful to look in to the built-in ""wave"" python module. This can manipulate wave files and might be enough to get you started, though it does have limitations as your needs expand.

Python,3da1sr,RisingStar,3,Thu Jul 16 00:24:53 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what kind of project you are working on. In general anything, at least from my experience, Flask is great in almost any of the same places as Django is as well. The key difference is that Django happens to ship with a lot of stuff already done for you. So if you are going to use those things, such as their login, ORM, forms, admin, etc., then Django is a great choice. Personally most of the time I only want one or two of those and I want them different. The big thing about Flask is it is much more minimal in what it ships, not what it can do.  Again though it really comes down to what you're creating. If your project is specifically just an API backend, which a lot of things are these days, Flask is great but I have also started using Bottle and more recently looking at Falcon.  TL;DR: potentially having to write a lot of stuff that Django just ships with."

Look into how to the various ways that '_ _ import _ _' works.  The original popularity of these types of MVC was inherent in the fact that time was saved during scoping and design. But that flexibility can ultimately will lead you to using your controller as a secondary router to parse parameters and then call other methods. With the approach described you end up locked in to a <method>/<param/> type call. This would prevent you from later going and doing something like <category>/<search>/<parameter>/ which might be a much end up being a much cleaner url structure for a given use case this would allow django to handle the overhead of parsing your route instead of duplicating that work over and over again within your controllers.

Python,3d8u9g,pysk00l,6,Tue Jul 14 13:01:30 2015 UTC,"what /u/pysk00l said about rollkeeper and imports.    also, there's a lot going on in just that snippet, so let's take a look.          def rollDice():             damage = random.randint(1,6)         damage = random.randint (1,6)    first:  it seems silly and nitpicky when you're new, but get used to forcing yourself to adhere to a good coding style now, before you build the bad habits.  Especially when you're soliciting feedback from others, it makes it much easier to read and keep track of what's going on.   random.randint (1,6) should be random.randint(1, 6) no space between the function name and the ( and add a space after each ,  second: the def keywork defines a function.  MOST of the time you want to do that at the root level of your module.  It's possible to nest functions inside of other functions, but you would rarely ever do it inside of a loop.  And for it to actually do anything it has to return a value, and then you have to call the function from somewhere.  I agree that factoring the diceroll into a function is a good idea, but you haven't quite done that here.   This is what that would actually look like in practice:    import random # imports at the top of the script # ... def roll_dice():     # Another code style recommendation is to use lowercase or                       # lower_case for function and variable names     damage = random.randint(1, 6)     return damage # ... damage = roll_dice() # ...   As for the loop itself, if you want to keep looping as long as a condition is true (e.g. the user keeps entering 'roll'):  while input() == 'roll':  # no () needed for comparisons like this     damage = roll_dice()     print(damage)    This is still not very good, however, because you don't check for typos at all.  'ROLL', 'orll', and 'rolll' all immediately exit the loop.  If the two accepted commands are 'roll' and 'attack' a better approach might be  while True:     user_input = input()     if user_input == 'roll':         damage = roll_dice()         print(damage)     elif user_input == 'attack':         break  Now, the two commands function as intended, and unrecognized strings are ignored.      Also, I won't go too deep into it, but it looks very unlikely that those classes function the way you intend.  Inside the class you almost never want to reference variables that you create outside of the class (damage and enemyDamahe, etc.).  I would take a step back and revisit some fundamentals.  There's tons of links on here to sites with good tutorials and interactive python courses, etc... Go over functions and classes some more, it'll make it much easier for your to organize your program.  EDIT: Formatting.  Again.  Again.  Again.  THEY ARE CODE BLOCKS, NOT A PART OF THE LIST!!!!! Again.  Again.  Fine, they ARE a part of the list."

Python,3d8u9g,Matthew94,6,Tue Jul 14 15:26:06 2015 UTC,"This works, and has use-cases, but shouldn't be your default approach.     avoid temporary variables staying alive.   I assume you're concerned from a memory management standpoint?  The first thing to keep in mind is that, unless you're actively doing something with large pieces of data, or doing it thousands/millions of times, it's considered best to just let the python garbage collector do it's thing.  Likewise, if you're working on very tightly constrained hardware (embedded systems, etc.) it can be worth worrying about, but in general it just doesn't matter.    If your program actively uses a few hundred KB of data, and but the python interpreter itself starts at 5MB, you can be 100% less efficient and it still doesn't matter.  Especially when you consider the RAM budget of most machines nowadays.  Even with only 1GB of RAM it's you're never going to have a meaningful impact with your constants and simple variable declarations.  Of course, when it's a pandas dataframe with a few billion values, or the contents of large files, etc. that's different.  But for defining simple constants and such your time and sanity are more valuable than a few KB of RAM.    Secondly, let's look at what you're actually doing here.  Remember that it's 'objects all the way down'.  In [1]: a = 10000  In [2]: b = a  In [3]: a is b Out[3]: True  In [4]: b = 10000  In [5]: a is b Out[5]: False   EDIT:  I deliberately used a 'large' value for a.  Try it with small values and see what happens So there's an object that contains the value '10000', and there's two names that point to that object.  For single integer values the difference may not be much, but for tuple(range(1, 10**9)) or something it's important.  The same applies to function calls and returns.  In [6]: def Spam(Eggs): ...:     return Eggs ...:   In [7]: b = Spam(a)  In [8]: a is b Out[8]: True   If the value you pass in is mutable (list, dict, etc.) then work done on b inside the function transparently modifies a on the outside.   And again, the memory usage here is that of one copy of the object, and two names that point to it.    In [9]: def return_bird():    ...:     bird = dict(state='dead')    ...:     return bird    ...:   In [10]: bird = return_bird()   So the dict created in the function is alive and well, and if we modify it, it's modified in-place.  In [11]: bird['state'] = 'just resting'  # same object   But if we re-assign we're overwriting the name with a reference to a different object (either another existing object, or one we're creating)  In [12]: o_bird = bird  In [13]: bird = dict(state='Definitely Resting')  In [14]: o_bird is bird Out[14]: False   So we still have an name bird that points to a dictionary that looks like the original one, but it's not the same object.  At this point python knows that the original object has no more names that reference it, so the garbage collector will free up that memory.  EDIT: Except, that's a lie, because the o_bird name still points there, but you get the idea.  Now, the details of how that happens exactly are a bit beyond me, and isn't always as simple as it seems (especially when it comes to actually releasing memory to the OS), but it really does ""just work"" in the very large majority of cases and shouldn't be an issue, and the impact of any inefficiency in the GC is probably worth less than your time spent trying to optimize it."
Python,3d8u9g,thegreattriscuit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:12:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the in depth response. I agree that I should probably just leave the variables alone.   it's considered best to just let the python garbage collector do it's thing.   There are two issues at hand.  The first is that if my setup code is in main, it will never be garbage collected until the program is finished so the collection can't do its thing.  I know it's not a lot of data but I'd rather only have variables I'm using exist.  The second one is debugging. Having temporary setup variables pollutes the variable namespace and hiding them in functions will avoid this issue."
Python,3d8u9g,Matthew94,2,Tue Jul 14 16:22:41 2015 UTC,"While you can actively prune names that are no longer in use (del x), I doubt that's really the most reasonable approach most of the time.  But what about:  def setup_foo(parm1, parm2):     CONSTANT = ...     var = parm * 10     return Foo(CONSTANT, var, parm2, ...)  def main():     foo = setup_foo(parm1=3, parm2='x')   edit: call it _setup_foo if you don't want it showing up in your IDE when you go to import this later, etc...  By pulling that function out of main() you enable the GC to do it's job just as well as the other approach, but you get to pull all that boilerplate away from the business-logic of your main script.    You mentioned avoiding ""namespace pollution"", and I think pulling that code out of main() has a similar effect.  If you really want to know what's going on in the setup, go look.  But once you're satisfied that setup_foo does what it's supposed to, you shouldn't have to keep looking past it as you work."

""Handling"" exceptions for me is typically to log the error and halt, skip this job and start the next one, or occasionally I can find a sane way to retry.  I suppose my use cases may not match yours, but I've never found a case where I wanted to handle exceptions right where they're thrown.

This is from a matplotlib mailing list:  Hello all,  Following much discussion, we are changing the default color map and styles in the upcoming 2.0 release!  The new default color map will be 'viridis' (aka option D).  I recommend everyone watch Nathaniel Smith and Ste?fan van der Walt's talk from SciPy2015 introducing the new color map and providing an introduction to the math of color perception: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU  We are soliciting proposals to change any and all other visual defaults (including adding new rcParams as needed).  If you have a proposal please create a PR or issue with the changes to rcsetup.py and matplotlibrc.template implementing the changes by August 9, 2015 (1 month from now). Do not worry about updating any failing tests.  At the end, Micheal Droettboom and I will decide on the new defaults.  A 'classic' style will be provided so reverting to the current default values will be a single line of python (mpl.style.use('classic')).  Please distribute this as widely as possible.  We only want to do this once and want to get feedback from as many users as possible.

The ”if it ain't broke don't fix it"" argument doesn't really apply when there's data showing it's broke.  Also, I attended this talk and the birds of a feather session for Matlab, pretty much everyone is in agreement that jet should not be the default, as well as most of the people I talked to at the conference. It's definitely not just one random guy at a conference, he's certainly a core developer in the scientific python community (as in, he wrote the pep to add the matrix multiplication operator in 3.5), and the community on average prefers the change. You can definitely still use jet too, they aren't removing it, it's just not going to be the default anymore."

Huh?   In the video he talks about where they had doctors diagnose problems in medical images that had been colored using jet versus several other color maps. The doctors reported that they liked jet better because it was familiar, but the data showed that they were significantly faster and more accurate with the newer color maps. What people think they are best with is not what they are necessarily best with. Cognitive biases are hard to overcome.    And if this is so important why not also complain about Matlab which also ditched jet recently?   Because I don't use Matlab.   Matplotlib took jet from Matlab because its what people are used to. If you use jet with matplotlib it's because more people use Matlab. I haven't heard any fuss on the engineering forums I'm on over Matlab picking a different color map. Matlab is still an entrenched industry tool, it's one of the most wildly used tools in engineering disciplines.    I'm not saying we should stick with jet.  I'm saying a jet-inspired colormap is what I want.   They have released a tool to help you make your own color map, and this next release will have a lot more built in themes too. Make one that has better smoothing yourself, or try out the new ones that are coming out.

Python,3d6qgk,billsil,3,Tue Jul 14 00:48:56 2015 UTC,"Colorbrewer spectral is pretty much a fixed jet, but it's divergent: its lightness gradient is dark at the ends and light in the middle.

For stress analysis (what I do), the fact that you have a green section or less than ideal transitions is irrelevant.  Red and blue matter.  Everything else doesn't really matter, but you want things to transition semi-clearly in between that.  3 color diverging color schemes (blue-white-red) are just weird.  Jet may be broken, but that doesn't mean you have to get rid of the blue-green-yellow-orange-red idea.  It means you should smooth it out.  It seems crazy to go from the default color map that everyone uses to getting rid of it because someone doesn't like it.  The whole RGB color scheme is flawed, yet almost everyone uses it.  We have 4 common color schemes (RGB, Lab, HSV, and some other one).  Only one should really be used (I forget which, but I think it's the other one :)."

But it also means knowing to use the data structures pretty well, have some functional programming 101 in mind, and getting how to use them all together.  Once you get iteration, you feel like str.join() is the only syntax that makes sense. Once you get iteration, you start writting functions that take care of iterables even if you don't know their size or if they are infinite. Once you get iteration you hide most of your complex algo behind a collection of generators you can swap. Once you get iteration your data is processed like a flow through pipes in your program."

Python,3d5k14,TDaltonC,7,Tue Jul 14 04:55:43 2015 UTC,How does gevent differ from asyncio?
Python,3d5k14,krenzalore,7,Tue Jul 14 07:31:20 2015 UTC,"Asyncio is mostly centered around the concepts of making asynchronous Input/Output operations work inside the framework of an event loop, and also using generator / yield calls to make its code nice to look at.  The event loop model has already been proved to work nicely by other underlying C implementations, the whole of Node.js, etc.  This is slightly more limited in scope to what gevent implements, which is cooperative green threads.  Green threads are differentiated from OS threads in that they are managed by the userland environment itself, rather than the OS system call mechanisms, and are generally cooperatively scheduled to run (pass each other the baton) rather than some using an outside predictive algorithm (the OS thread scheduler). This all means, when used correctly, they are way more efficient (and effective) at implementing asynchronous threaded programming than OS threads.  Green threads also allow asynchronous IO to happen but through their cooperative scheduling mechanism, rather than explicitly being designed around an event loop. As it happens, Gevent's hub (thread manager) looks rather like an event loop anyway :)  Purely pragmatically, they just have different APIs, and gevent comes with more general asynchronous tooling off the bat."
Python,3d5k14,ivosaurus,2,Tue Jul 14 10:49:21 2015 UTC,Is the paradigm similar to Go?

Python,3d5k14,ivosaurus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:19:01 2015 UTC,"An often overlooked advantage of gevent over asyncio is that gevent also allows to run synchronous code asynchronously. A library for example doesn't necessarily needs to adapt to gevent in order to be used with gevent. This is possible thanks to the monkeypatching antipattern. Asyncio can't give you that.  Still, I would always recommend asyncio over gevent because explicit (asynchronous code) is better then (implicit asynchronous) code IMHO."

For the record, I am not much of a GUI programmer but use gPodder daily and was always fascinated by its Python design and support for multiple backends.

Python,3d5reu,Poffey21,-1,Mon Jul 13 20:45:31 2015 UTC,"If changing the database is an option, you could look into a graph database that comes with a REST server out of the box. You could use Rexster as an interface to many different databases, or use a database such as OrientDB, which has a REST serer built in."
Python,3d5reu,neRok00,0,Tue Jul 14 01:10:00 2015 UTC,What about CouchDB?
Python,3d5reu,ExceedinglyEdible,0,Tue Jul 14 03:53:44 2015 UTC,"As a document database, I'm sure it's also a suitable option. The benefit of a graph database are edges, which could be considered as 'foreign keys' saved in both primary records, all maintained for you by the database. OrientDB in particular is a graph database built on top of a document database, so you could use it just like CouchDB/MongoDB, or take it further and use all its graph features. This explains it pretty well: http://orientdb.com/orientdb-vs-mongodb/"
Python,3d6w8i,horse_architect,5,Tue Jul 14 00:08:32 2015 UTC,"list.append() modifies the list it was called on and doesn't return anything (or it returns None, which is the same thing.)  That's kind of an established thing — that a method either returns a new object and does not mutate the object it was invoked on, or it mutates and doesn't return anything.  It's considered too confusing for a method to both mutate and return something, although that does happen in certain cases.  Anyway, method chaining is all about what the method returns, because method chaining means that you're invoking a method on the value returned by the previous method call.  list.append() doesn't return anything so you can't chain anything after it, since you'd be trying to invoke a method on None which results in the error that you see above.  But plenty of methods do return something and can be chained, e.g.  items = string.strip().split()   In your example, there's a method for this very purpose that avoids the need to assign anything:  gram.symbols.setdefault(current_key, []).append(line)   Another alternative that I find more readable is to use a defaultdict:  from collections import defaultdict ... gram.symbols = defaultdict(list) ... gram.symbols[current_key].append(line)   Edit: after reviewing your examples, I wasn't entirely clear.  The reason you get the error is because .append() returns None, and you are assigning that return value back into the dict.  The next time around, you try to invoke .append() on that None, which is the error; it's not due to trying to chain something after .append(), but it's essentially the same problem just in different clothes."
Python,3d6w8i,Rhomboid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:36:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to write this excellent answer! I was aware that mutable vs immutable types are a big deal and common sticking point, but I guess I didn't make the connection here. I was playing fast and loose with append() and predictably this caused the problem. Your answer there makes perfect sense, thanks!"
Python,3d6w8i,breamoreboy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:00:41 2015 UTC,"Stating that list.append() doesn't return anything is just plain wrong, like all Python functions that work in place, it always returns None.

I corrected you and you had the audacity to state ""Did you not read what I actually wrote? Why are you telling me things that I already pointed out in my original comment?"".

That's what I said in my original comment, and all of my follow up comments.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  You somehow feel the need to repeatedly tell me things that I obviously already know as if they are news to me or news to anyone that has read what I've written, as if you were correcting me and pointing out something that wasn't blatantly obvious from what I wrote.

I'm not sure I can do a DROP DATABASE or whatever the sqllite equivalent was, but I feel like I could put some nasty LIKE, CONCAT, subselects, and other functions to lock the DB up. I think params is the way to do it though you may have to use Session for that. for i in query.cursor will grab rows as a stream when you want all of the data. I might just add a fetchall() here too to avoid having the db connection open more than it needs to be. I think the case for leaving the connection open and fetching one at a time is when you'll know what you want when you find it (and then you conn.close()).

Replaces some dummy values in the swf  Replaces some dummy shellcode with better (I assume) shellcode  Something is XOR encrypted and it's inserting the key into the swf file so it can decrypt it and then use the values or jump to it to execute it. Helps avoid detection/AV.  This is some pretty janky code to patch out dummy values with URLs to pull down files.   Really there's nothing that interesting going on here.

Nothing about Unicode says one of them is ""official"" or is the ""actual"" version, or that the other one isn't.

Edit: Actually, upon further investigation, all mutable sequences (like list) have an inplace sequence.reverse() method, but then why don't the immutable sequences (such as str) have a sequence.reversed() method?   You answered your own question - a string object is immutable, so you can't have an in-place reverse. It would need to return a new object - which would mean str.reversed() would be surprisingly different in comparison to other iterable.reverse() methods."
Python,3czngc,kemitche,0,Mon Jul 13 01:42:12 2015 UTC,"Well I never said the immutable reversed would be in place. In fact I explicitly named it like the also-not-inplace reversed builtin to emphasize that since it's not mutable, it does return the reversed string."

Python,3czngc,GummyKibble,2,Sun Jul 12 16:46:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's my point too, I guess I'm just not explaining it well. object.reverse() returns none. reverse is always an inplace method. object.reversed(), and reversed(object) never returns none, because none of them are in place methods.  I'm specifically suggesting that as a design decision, all mutable sequences have a mutseq.reverse inplace method. Certain immutable sequences, where deemed necessary in addition to just the builtin reversed (as it is with str, imo), may have a immutseq.reversed method (specifically named both differently from mutseq.reverse and named the same as builtin reversed), which obviously cannot be inplace, and correspondingly immutseq.reverse doesn't exist (trying to use it would be an AttributeError)."

Of course, the slicing approach has the advantage that it also works on tuples.  .reverse would be wrong because that name implies a mutating operation, and strings are immutable. It would have to be .reversed, and then it looks kinda redundant.  And really, needing a new string that is the reverse of an existing one is just not that common. If you just want to iterate over a string in reverse order, that's what reversed (by itself) is for.  Mutable sequences have .reverse methods because they can implement that more efficiently than outsourcing to reversed. Speed notwithstanding, replacing an immutable object with its reversed equivalent would temporarily require both potentially large objects in memory - reversed provides a generator, allowing the user to only incur the memory hit if necessary."

Example:  >>> s = 'python' >>> s[0:6:1] 'python' >>> s[0:6:2] 'pto' >>> s[::2] 'pto'   General form: [lo:hi:pos_step]. Let's see with a negative step:  >>> s[::-2] 'nhy' >>> s[5:-1:-2] '' >>> s[5:-7:-2] 'nhy' >>> s[5::-2] 'nhy'   If you use a negative step, then the general form becomes [hi:lo:neg_step]. Notice that hi comes before lo! Also notice that if you want to go to the beginning and want to include the very first character, -1 is not good for the lo value because -1 is the LAST character. Solution: use -7 (in this example) or just simply leave the lo part empty and then it will mean ""go back until the beginning"".

I'm skeptical about any of the name possibilities not adding some confusion.   and by the way, why doesn't reversed() simply yield a generator, rather than a class?

Even if it wasn't, reversed would probably be a class, not a generator function, like virtually all the lazy iterables in the stdlib (consider the entirety of itertools or Python 3's map).

Well, there's a corollary to the one obvious way to do it:   Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.   I don't find that having both extended slicing syntax and reverse available to violate having one obvious way to do something as they serve different purposes.  Slicing syntax works on objects (typically sequences, but I won't say exclusively) that implement __getitem__ and can parse the slice object. Strings and lists are good examples, but you can build your own as well.  reverse on the other hand works on any object that implements __reversed__. I'm actually unsure if it'll do something behind the scenes if this method isn't defined -- like how for will look for __iter__ first and fall back to using __len__ and __getitem__ together."

There's list.sort() which mutates the list in place, and sorted(iterable) which returns a new sorted object from any iterable.  The same applies to reversing a sequence.  There's list.reverse() which mutates in-place, and reversed(seq) which takes any sequence and returns an reverse iterator.  If there was to be a str.reverse() it would have to be a mutating action, but strings are immutable.  A non-mutating method str.reversed() would clash with the established policy.  Besides, reversing is a high level concept that applies to more than just strings.  Using [::-1] is idiomatic and works with any sequence type.  It doesn't require that every sequence type implements some method."

It's interesting what kind of performance difference does it make if it does at all?  Compared to MicroPython, your first paragraph does not answer the questions, as you do not need to know any C with it.   Although it's great to let newcomers start easily, IMHO you'll need to know a bit more deeper about how computer works and how it executes in real time, as many embedded applications will require this knowledge. Embedded programming is usually totally different from ordinary software and/or desktop/web app.  To continue my rant :), I cannot find link to github, bitbucket, etc. Is your project open-source?   Comparing to MicroPython (MP), can I run Viper on compatible chips (not boards)? With MP I can use it on compatible chips, I can create my own custom board, for custom application and flash MP into ARM micro-controller. Can I do this with Viper? Also, can I not use your tools (Viper IDE)? Because usually I run everything from terminal, as I don't like when software decides for me and I do not know what's happening. Also, project seems really difficult with all Viper IDE/Cloud stuff, where with MP, I connect it with USB, and that's it, I have MP shell in my terminal.  It seems, that syntax wise there is a lot of inspiration from Arduino. :) For me MP is more pythonic. Correct my were I'm wrong, but by first look Viper looks very lean python implementation (no classes (?, there are objects, but I do not see example of a class), no decorators, no **kwargs, too small Python stdlib (of course, MP does not implement full stdlib, though it has micro implementation for it and is much more full), so what's the difference from super basic ViperPython and Arduino? Many examples would be very similar in ViperPython and Arduino.  Sorry, but MP seems more 'full' project. It has pythonic libraries, it has many parts of Python, so I can write pythonic OO code. I can use it on many systems, and create my own boards, for my custom embedded projects (posibility for a commercial use). Also I have a possibility to optimise MP code with assembler commands. Finally, it's open source, therefore it has clear internals on how it works and is extensible/optimizable by everyone.

It's a library to allow you to work with your data even when it's very high-dimensional without writing any plotting code.

Python,3d1dmy,daveydave400,2,Sun Jul 12 19:16:47 2015 UTC,Its not constantly returning NaN only about 1% of the time but that is too many. The output accelerations from the calculation are outputting NaN. The global accelerations are fine.

(There is also a concrete use case in the issue comments regarding parameters are only required in bunches).  With other data types, you use the ""if obj:"" syntax when you want to test if an object is either null OR some other equivalent form of ""empty"" for whatever type you're using. This is the official answer, but it doesn't lay down general rules, so this is my best guess.   So an empty list [], an empty string """", the number 0, a timedelta representing no change in time...these are all ""empty"" or ""trivial"". The docs also mention that any object with a len of 0 will be false - so empty HTTP responses, empty collections in general, will all be false. Maybe a good test is to see if adding an empty object to a non-empty object of the same type changes anything - or ""additive identity"" for math nerds (all the above examples pass this test).  But you can't add datetimes! And I really don't see any sense in which midnight UTC is ""empty"" or ""trivial"" - it happens once a day for gods sake!

But it looks like it doesn't increment it until the next line, so they both get assigned the same instance.  At least that is what it looks like, I haven't looked through how python does this at all :/"
Python,3cu6ej,Rainfly_X,15,Fri Jul 10 23:35:57 2015 UTC,That would seem like the sort of thing that could be dependent upon implementation (CPython vs. PyPy for instance) too.

Python,3cu6ej,Make3,2,Sat Jul 11 16:56:08 2015 UTC,"Because ints are immutable and cannot be changed in place, Python can reuse them. If I write a = []; b = [] then I absolutely have to get a new list for both a and b, there is no option to use the same list for each. But with a = 257; b = 257 it doesn't matter whether I get the same int or not, since the objects cannot be modified in place. So the Python interpreter has a choice of either creating two separate 257 int objects, one for each of a and b, or only creating one object and using it for both. Some versions of Python do the second.  But you cannot rely on it. It's an optimization, not a guarantee, and it depends on the version and implementation of the the Python interpreter being used."
Python,3cu6ej,TagSmile,14,Sun Jul 12 16:37:26 2015 UTC,"Dunno if you're familiar with C++ at all.

The first comparison (which is like == in Python, and probably does what you expect) calls operator==() and will evaluate whether the two strings have the same value. The second comparison (which is like is in Python) doesn't call any method, it simply decides whether the two things have the same memory address.  The Python is keyword or comparing memory addresses in C or C++ have the advantage of being very, very fast, (because comparing a pointer is a single operation) but they have the disadvantage of returning non-equality for some objects which are, for all intents and purposes, equal. You wouldn't ever expect 2342125 2342125 to be not-equal, for instance. operator==() in C++ and __eq__() (which is what == calls) in Python have the advantage of working the way you expect them to,* but it typically takes more time to execute.  * Unless operator==() or __eq__() are written terribly horribly rottenly badly.

However, put multiple statements on the same line, and there are potential optimisations that may be done where python notices the same, immutable value is used multiple places, and so can freely substitute the same object.

Here's the example with functions:   def f(x):     del(x)     print(x)  x = 5 y = [1, 2, 3] f(x); f(y)  # UnboundLocalError  print(x); print(y) # prints assigned values   The same thing isn't happening with the try/catch block."

Python,3cu6ej,Matthew94,11,Sat Jul 11 15:31:19 2015 UTC,without any semicolons   Prove it.
Python,3cu6ej,ingolemo,33,Fri Jul 10 22:11:12 2015 UTC,"Sure, so lets start with a basic statement:  Any while loop can be rewritten as a for loop.  I'm just going to go ahead and state that.  Now these can get rather complex, for example your for loop may be in the form for x, y, z in someComplexGenerator:, where someComplexGenerator does lots of thingsTM, but that's fine.  So now, any for loop can be replaced with a list comprehension:  for i in range(15):     #do some complex thing  # can be rewritten as  def function(i):     print(sum(range(i)))  [function(i) for i in range(15)]   So now we need to rewrite our functions in one line...lambdas!  [lambda i: print(sum(range(i))) for i in range(15)] # I made a mistake in this one I'm too lazy to fix it, meh   sure there's an extra side effect, but meh.  Now we also need our program to run:  (lambda val=15:[(lambda i: print(sum(range(i))))(i) for i in range(15)])() # this makes use of IIFEs if you're familiar with javascript   oh and that keyword argument syntax at the beginning lets us declare variables in global scope, we can also use it elsewhere to declare variables in a local scope if we need to reuse things or reference them.  here's another wonky one that I wrote to demonstrate some things, sadly you can't nest context managers or it would be possible to handle exceptions generally  with type(""ctx"", (),{""__enter__"": lambda s: s, ""__exit__"": lambda s, e, v, t: 1})() as d: (lambda x=10: [print(a) if a < x else list(next(iter(()))) for a in __import__('itertools', globals(), locals(), [], 0).count(0)])()   oh right that one also has me define a context manager inline, as in I create a class, that's equivalent to  class ctx:     def __enter__(self):         return self      def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):         return 1  # this swallows errors, I'm a monster  import itertools x = 10  with ctx() as d:     for a in itertools.count(0):         if a < x:             print(a)         else:             raise StopIteration   So that gets us most things, but what about recursion through tree structures, because that'd be nice.  Well we get this:  lambda a,N:(lambda v,s:((n,v.add(n),s.extend(N(n)))[0]for n in s if not{n}&v))(set(),[a]) # this is BFS that's also been minified, here's an expanded version:  lambda start,Neighbors:     (lambda visited,successors:         ((n,visited.add(n),successors.extend(Neighbors(n)))[0]for n in successors if not{n}&visited))     (set(),[start])  # visited, successors   This uses a trick that's rather sneaky.  You construct a tuple (n, visited.add(n), successors.extend(Neighbors(n))) and then only ever take the first object.  you construct the entire tuple conditionally, and visited.add and successors.extend both have side effect.  useful for updating your frontier and visited set as you iterate across successors (which gets longer as you go).  Or you can use the y combinator since we've defined a lambda calculus via our prior steps."

If you treated cfg as a block on anon code, it would break very subtly after the first run since myconfigfile would have already consumed the file on subsequent runs.  The way Python handles this is actually completely consistent.  Every function contains a set of defaults that are the results of evaluation when the function is defined.

Anyway,    all functions have a return value, even functions that don't contain return statements. If execution reaches the end of a function, or a statement return with no value specified, None is returned. This is what was happening with your initial code. None being returned is significant because it is considered false-ish. For example, in if None: print ('foo'), print('foo') will never be executed. Depending on how you are checking the result, this may impact your code. Overall I'd suggest making a flow chart.    If x < 2 it's not prime (?) if x == 2 it is prime if it's divisible by anything up to (x-1) it's not prime What if it's not divisible by anything up to (x-1), but greater than 2?"

You want to have your return True statement outside your for loop. Think of your for loop as checking every single possibility of integer division from 2 to x. You don't want to say the number is prime until you've checked all of the numbers right? So it would make sense to return true at the very end AFTER your for loop.

But as soon as a non-ASCII hotel name comes from the database, it blows up in your face.  I consider this a feature in % formatting, and a bug in .format() -- the format strings themselves are almost always ASCII, but the interpolated variables are very often non-ASCII.

The catch is that, compared to the gains you can get with the other two options it doesn't give that much of a performance boost.  Cython can take a little work. It really helps to profile and use the ""cython -a"" output to really find the right places to annotate your python code and squeeze out extra performance. There's also some overhead in working with Cython (actually cythonizing and compiling files etc.) unless you are working with ipython notebook and cython cell magics.  Numba can give incredible performance improvements, and is practically free to use (just add @numba.jit() to the top of your function). The catch is that it doesn't work on everything. If you actually want to see real performance from it you better be working on numerical code with numpy. Numba also asks you to write your code differently -- you actually want to do the ""dumb"" things of actually writing loops running over numpy arrays etc. that are the naive approach -- it will work otherwise, but you won't see much performance gain."
Python,3cstcq,lmcinnes,2,Fri Jul 10 19:34:00 2015 UTC,"One thing I didn't like about Numba is that if I used it in an app and distributed it, I'd have to ask every user to install llvm (I think this was the package)  which is not available through pip.  Anyone know if there is a way around that?"
Python,3cstcq,Deto,0,Sun Jul 12 02:28:43 2015 UTC,"The standard answer is to get Numba via conda. If you aren't already heavily invested in the virtualenv world, then conda is really excellent since it provides the sandboxed environments of virtual env with the package management of pip, but handles non-python dependencies much better. Continuum also provides most of the key  Also you can install packages into a conda env via pip so you don't have to abandon pip if you go that route."

You need to install hdf5, which is not pip installable. Conda was designed in part to solve this very problem since it can package anything in a language agnostic way. This is huge in the scientific ecosystem, which has a lot of non-python dependencies.   I certainly understand and appreciate that some users do not have the flexibility to switch up their python package manager for a single  library. In those cases, I think you need to use your system package manager or something else to get the dependencies. This is just the reality of current deficiencies in pip AFAIK."

You'd then just conda install the app (in a conda environment if required) and it would pull your requirements you built as well.  Conda is very similar to platter, it just typically is distributed with a python interpreter. However, you can install conda from any python interpreter that has pip, with pip install conda.  Note: You can conda install from anaconda.org via your own public/private channel, or, you can conda install from a local store of files, similar to wheels.

Firstly, it is a technical roadblock for some Python developers, though I don't see that as a huge factor.  Regardless, secondly, it is especially a turnoff to folks looking into Python and ultimately a PR issue.  The solution boils down to natively supporting multiple cores in Python code.   Heh. So let's go full-cynic mode: finish out the already somewhat present support for subinterpreters (basically, all global variables should be moved to a huge Interpreter_State struct), then just replicate the multiprocessing interface on top of that and bam! you have the so called green multiprocessing (like Perl AFAIK) but now you can market it as having got rid of the GIL.  Obviously you'll still have the copies of all imported modules (including builtins) and probably the performance improvements in marshaling objects would be pretty marginal compared to using mmap, but yeah, mission accomplished!  (I actually fully agree about that being 99% a PR problem. I don't think any roughly Python-like language from PHP to Scheme has free threading support, but for some reason only Python folks waste countless hours being upset about it on the internet)."

It's certainly doable.  I suspect the core code base doesn't change all that often.  In terms of the early releases, you could certainly say not all versions of CPython 3.6 support 100% of functionality (e.g. asyncio).  There could be a transition period.   note that a major problem is the refcounting gc and another major problem is the seemingly atomic operations that no longer would be without gil   I'd say the same thing about removing the GIL in the first place, but multiple people have done it.  Yes, you'd need to update your build process with a new global flag, but I don't really think it would that bad to have both in the same code base as long as you organize it properly.  I really don't mind the GIL since I live in the world of scientific programming where the GIL is not a hindrance.  However, that's not the case for everyone.  Just as in the way people complained about the matrix multiply operation (which is the best Python 3 feature for me), there are people that care about the GIL.  I just see the writing on the wall.

So, instead, I now use miniconda to set things up. Each project I work on gets its own environment and only the packages it needs, and porting that environment configuration is incredibly easy. As an example, consider Christine Doig's Bokeh/Blaze tutorial from the SciPy currently happening. She provides this simple yaml file with the distribution for her tutorial on git:  name: scipy-tutorial dependencies:   - blaze=0.8.0   - bokeh=0.9.0   - ipython=3.2.0   - ipython-notebook   - netcdf4   - boto   From within the folder containing the code, creating the special, minimal environment necessary to run her code just requires executing the command conda env create. And voila! Special environment with the specific package versions she was using.  You can specify versions of your packages if you're worried about conflicts. Additionally, if there are any other dependencies, conda will inspect your configuration and compute the necessary packages and versions to download automatically for you. I really can't recommend it highly enough."

In fact, conda environments are more isolated than virtual environments because they also allow for third party packaging such as libjpg etc. The great thing about conda is that it is a completely isolated python interpreter that really makes it impossible to break your system Python. Also, on every platform conda packages (much like pip wheels) are pre-built and thus creating new environments is nearly instantaneous.

The guy who posts the most bug reports is constantly complaining that things don't work that are totally his fault.

It's his choice, but I don't see the purpose.  He's not contributing to the project.

Of course I run a Linux system, not the usual OS - in a general sense, but not a custom OS. Installation of Python and some packages shouldn't be that hard. Using Conda is fine, but seems more like a work-around. Our professor booked an entire lesson to help with the installation (about half a year ago), and strongly suggested using Conda. I like Python (that's why I choose to use it, instead of Matlab), but the current situation seems to neglect the installation process, and I wondered why."

Error messages?   python is just inconsistent.   Package management is one of the annoying parts of programming.  I don't think I've come across anything that I consider ""good"", though I consider Python to be one of the more pleasant ones (except on Windows), part of which is simply because Python does not compile to native code so you don't have to worry about ugly things like ABI compatibility.  Now, I just made a quick virtualenv myself and it seemed to work just fine out of the box:  virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.4 venv . venv/bin/activate pip install matplotlib # drink some coffee   One of the tricky things with matplotlib is that it requires some ""external"" non-Python libraries (to interact with the GUI) like Qt, which lie outside Python's package management.  This is why it's easier to install using your system package manager because the system's package manager can take care of these ""external"" dependencies.  If you do it manually, you will need to read up on what matplotlib requires."
Python,3coawj,protoUbermensch,6,Thu Jul 9 19:22:21 2015 UTC,"In particular using it for scientific ""programming"".   So here's the thing: if you're doing scientific programming, you won't need virtualenv. For web apps that you will later need to deploy remotely or for doing extensive app development, a venv is a good thing to have. But for most scientific computing, you will not ever need numpy 1.8.1 and numpy 1.9.2 installed at the same time, as these libraries are usually stable and have good backwards compatibility.  Now, one thing that sometimes messes with your python installations if you're not using venv is system-wide installations vs. pip-installations. Concretely, system-wide installations are often placed in /usr/lib while pip installs in /usr/local/lib. If you have two version of the same lib installed, you'll need to make sure that the right one is loaded. I could well imagine that is the source of your problems. Personally, I always stick with pip (or rather, use setup.py) because I want to optimize my numpy-builds, and don't bother with the system-package.

What should be the most reproducible of sciences instead publishes pseudo-code with some vague implementation details.

All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does and written to the stream, separated by sep and followed by end. Both sep and end must be strings; they can also be None, which means to use the default values. If no objects are given, print() will just write end.  The file argument must be an object with a write(string) method; if it is not present or None, sys.stdout will be used. Since printed arguments are converted to text strings, print() cannot be used with binary mode file objects. For these, use file.write(...) instead.

It returns nothing (None).  % is an operator using a string as a template that contains markers. It creates a new string were the marker are replaced with a string représentation of the other arguments. It returns a string:  >>> amount = 1 >>> msg = ""Stock remaining: %s"" % amount >>> type(msg)     str >>> print(msg) Stock remaining: 1   So in your first example, you create a string, then print it. On the second one, you ask print to make the best of the arguments you pass to it to display something.  % (and it's more modern form format) is used when you want to create strings. It's powerful, precise, and very explicit : you should use it in your large programs.  printing directly in comma is short to type and handy. You should use it in your quick script and shell explorations."
Python,3co1hj,gustl64,2,Thu Jul 9 17:18:01 2015 UTC,"Why?  Well, there isn't a big difference between '%s' and the latter, which is just string concatenation warmed over.  Named interpolations, on the other hand, are a very nice feature of '%' that mops the floor with either example.  print (""Name: %(name)s Value: %(value)s"" % {     ""name"": ""rumplestiltskin"", ""value"": ""somevalue"" })   Here, you can supply an entire dictionary to the % operator, and pick and choose what key goes where.  Repeating elements, is also possible.  This technique is also completely order-independent for both inputs and outputs; the basic %s format specifiers must have specific inputs at the correct index to work.  This has a lot of use for internationalization, as well as keeping your data and formatting separate and loosely coupled (which is good practice).  Edit: as /u/santiagobasuito mentioned, str.format() along with {keyword} interpolations is a cleaner and more readable route for the same thing.  print (""Name: %(name)s Value: %(value)s"".format(**{     ""name"": ""rumplestiltskin"", ""value"": ""somevalue"" }))"

Python,3ckqnl,Cosmologicon,54,Wed Jul 8 20:39:51 2015 UTC,"CPython is the standard implementation, built by the same people who design the Python language. It is, as /u/wmpl said, what you are probably using if you don't know what you're using. The rest of the entries in the diagram are imitators of CPython (not meant in any pejorative sense).  IronPython is a .NET version of Python. If you're a .NET programmer, and you want to use Python, then IronPython is for you. If not, then probably not.  Jython is Python running on the Java Virtual Machine. If you want to link Python code with code in Java -- or other JVM languages like Clojure, Scala, Groovy, etc. -- or if you just like the JVM, then Jython is for you. If not, then probably not.  PyPy was an effort to write a Python interpreter in Python, which has since transmogrified into a bleeding-edge compilation & dynamic-code-optimization engine, with Python being the primary programming language supported. Theoretically, PyPy does the same thing as CPython, only your code will execute faster. In practice, PyPy tends to be significantly behind CPython in introducing new language features. There is also (in my experience) a noteworthy start-up delay when executing code with PyPy, but it does tend to be faster in the long run (= more than half a second or so). If you are not using the latest Python features, and you are writing something besides a quickly executing utility script, then PyPy might be for you.  [EDIT. Ignore this paragraph, and see the reply by /u/Veedrac.] Numba is a Python compiler that (like, for example, clang) targets LLVM; the LLVM will typically be compiled to native code. Numba is aimed primarily at projects that use NumPy, the leading Python scientific-computing package. Apparently Numba offers specific advantages to projects that use NumPy, but I'm not familiar with exactly what these are. (Also, the ""CPython + Numba"" in the diagram does not make sense to me; I don't see how Numba would integrate with CPython. Maybe I know less about Numba than I thought I did.)  I know only a little about Cython. It includes a Python compiler that targets C; the C code will then typically be compiled to native code, as the diagram indicates. Cython also has a number of language extensions that are not present in vanilla Python. It is aimed at high performance and tight integration with C code.  My knowledge of the remaining entries is meager indeed. I'll leave them to someone else."
Python,3ckqnl,ggchappell,17,Wed Jul 8 21:04:08 2015 UTC,"I'll try and cover some parts you've missed.  Pyston is an up-and-coming Python JIT, like PyPy. It aims to support CPython's C extensions, which is the main reason Dropbox funded its development. It is not production ready. Another future competitor might be ZipPy, which uses Graal and Truffle. I don't know if ZipPy will ever be production-ready, though, or if it's just a proof of concept.  MicroPython is a minified version of Python designed for constrained-memory situations. It aims to support Python 3 and has some tools to improve runtime above CPython. I have not been particularly convinced of its applicability for general usage, and it's still developing, so I would not recommend it for everyday usage. Consider this if wanting to write Python when you have little system memory.  Numba is a CPython library that compiles code at runtime with LLVM. It specializes on a well-chosen subset of Python useful in numeric computation, and is not itself a complete runtime environment. It is also not technically compliant, but this is fine as it is a per-method opt-in.  Cython is an almost-superset of Python, that aims to allow seamless mixing of C and Python in one combined language. It allows writing fast C code in a convenient-to-embed manner and allows simple wrapping of C libraries. It has relatively widespread usage, but it being encroached on by specialist tools from both sides (eg. CFFI and PyPy or Numba). Cython does not itself contain a runtime, and instead reuses an existing CPython's runtime. This means that simply running normal Python code in Cython will only remove bytecode dispatch overhead, which is normally only a tiny fraction of runtime.   Nuitka aims to replace CPython's bytecode dispatch exactly the same way Cython does, but hopes to further compile code by using appropriate static analysis and further fine-grained compilation. Many people, myself included, are very sceptical of this approach. Nuitka has yet to show any impressive speed improvements, but several people have claimed that it makes distribution of code much easier since it produces single compiled binaries. It should be nearly 100% compliant with CPython, with the exception of runtime code introspection.  On the topic of PyPy, it's worth noting that PyPy isn't missing features in the same way a C++ compiler would be. Either PyPy has a release for a specific version of Python or it does not, and its stable releases are extremely compatible. If you're not using CPython-specific code (eg. CPython extensions) and you're running on a version of Python that PyPy supports, it will almost certainly work. Even CPython implementation details tend to get copied in PyPy."

Not everything is supported in numba, so it either doesn't speed up your job (it will switch to object mode if something its trying to compile doesn't work) or will refuse to compile (if you explicitly said to not let some function run in object mode)  To be honest I'm not sure of how much can really be done purely in numba compiled functions."

Python is currently my favourite language, but CPython is often too slow for the models of systems that I create.  PyPy is often 10x faster for me.  I suspect that PyPy's use in general is less common than it deserves because its installation procedure isn't very well documented for the end-user.  For example, don't bother with the PyPy packaged with Debian and Ubuntu because there are almost no packaged libraries, and you can't install libraries with PIP because that's broken.   So, for example, to install on Ubuntu, you need to go to the PyPy download page, download ""Squeaky's portable Linux binary"" and untar it. Then use the provided ""virtualenv"" in that package to create a virtual environment into which libraries can be installed with the provided ""pip"".  Edit: typos  These are my notes for installing the package into a directory and installing Numpy and the Pillow image library:  tar -xjf pypy-*-portable.tar.bz2 ./pypy-*-portable/bin/virtualenv-pypy myenv cd myenv/bin ln -s ""$PWD/pypy"" /usr/local/bin/pypy ./pip install git+https://bitbucket.org/pypy/numpy.git ./pip install pillow"

If you want to raise the profile of PyPy, it probably doesn't need publicising so much as simply ""enabling"" it a little better for the end user.   When I looked for ways to speed up my Python programs, I did a quick test of many of the things mentioned in this thread.  PyPy looked to be ""almost useless"" because while CPython has hundreds of special-purpose libraries ready-packaged in Linux, PyPy apparently had nothing.  Hearing from somebody that PyPy deserved a second chance, I tried downloading a recent build, but gave up after not being able to load libraries -- the instructions for setting up the virtual environment that were turned up with a Google search seem to be effectively broken to me. Finally after finding time to try to resolve it during a slack period, after trying many things that broke, I discovered the ""virtualenv-pypy"" in ""Squeaky's portable Linux binary"", which actually did work. Then I discovered that I could install libraries and that several useful ones worked.  So I think that's the main problem: How many non-developer end-users like me are going to plough through those issues? I suspect that most would have found a different solution other than PyPy by then."

Generally you should complain on debian/ubuntu (pip is a massive hack, that does not help).  Additionally, distributing binaries on linux is not a thing. We really can't make it happen, the portable binary e.g. comes with statically linked openssl that a lot of sysadmins would consider a big no no. It's just linux in general and has nothing to do with pypy.  Again, the picture is terrible and denializm does not help, but it's really not just pypy problem, but anything that takes a while to build."

Python,3ckqnl,fancy_pantser,3,Wed Jul 8 20:55:54 2015 UTC,"Just-in-time compilation:       In computing, just-in-time compilation (JIT), also known as dynamic translation, compilation is done during execution of a program – at run time – rather than prior to execution.  Most often this consists of translation to machine code, which is then executed directly, but can also refer to translation to another format.  JIT compilation is a combination of the two traditional approaches to translation to machine code – ahead-of-time compilation (AOT), and interpretation – and combines some advantages and drawbacks of both.  Roughly, JIT compilation combines the speed of compiled code with the flexibility of interpretation, with the overhead of an interpreter and the additional overhead of compiling (not just interpreting). JIT compilation is a form of dynamic compilation, and allows adaptive optimization such as dynamic recompilation – thus in theory JIT compilation can yield faster execution than static compilation. Interpretation and JIT compilation are particularly suited for dynamic programming languages, as the runtime system can handle late-bound data types and enforce security guarantees.

Yes, JIT compilation compiles and executes in what appears to be a single step. Thus, ""at runtime"". OTOH, if we're going to execute compiled code, then we must compile before we execute. Thus, ""before execution"", even if only just barely before.  Or were you referring to some other issue? If so, then please explain."
Python,3ckqnl,ggchappell,12,Wed Jul 8 21:43:04 2015 UTC,"JIT compilers are monitoring code as it's executing, which allows several types of special optimization and adjustment of strategies. That's not the same as taking a C++ program, compiling it and then running it."

Python,3ckqnl,ggchappell,8,Wed Jul 8 22:46:08 2015 UTC,"It's cool. A Just-In-Time compiler can optimize for the specific architecture its running on and it can also monitor performance of code its compiled and change optimization strategies if performance isn't as expected.   Here's some specific examples (obviously it's not the general case) where PyPy was able to beat C because of its just-in-time nature:  http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/08/pypy-is-faster-than-c-again-string.html   Run under PyPy, at the head of the unroll-if-alt branch, and compiled with GCC  4.5.2 at -O4 (other optimization levels were tested, this produced the best  performance). It took 0.85 seconds to execute under PyPy, and 1.63 seconds  with the compiled binary. We think this demonstrates the incredible potential of  dynamic compilation, GCC is unable to inline or unroll the sprintf call, because it  sits inside of libc.   http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/02/pypy-faster-than-c-on-carefully-crafted.html   Hence, PyPy 50% faster than C on this carefully crafted example. The reason is  obvious - static compiler can't inline across file boundaries. In C, you can  somehow circumvent that, however, it wouldn't anyway work with shared libraries.  In Python however, even when the whole import system is completely dynamic,  the JIT can dynamically find out what can be inlined. That example would work  equally well for Java and other decent JITs, it's however good to see we work in  the same space :-)"
Python,3ckqnl,alcalde,6,Wed Jul 8 23:58:38 2015 UTC,They're not the same thing at all.  JIT compilers compile code during runtime and they compile it all the way down to machine code. Most JIT compilers only compile the most performance sensitive parts of your code (by measuring it as it runs in real time) and they interpret the rest.  Bytecode compilers compile the entire code before any of it is executed and then interpret the resulting bytecode.

When a linguist talks about a rule, they're not referring to a law that has to be enforced, like Thou Shalt Not Spit on the Sidewalk, or Thou Shalt Not Split Infinitives. They're referring to a law that describes actual behavior, like the Law of Gravity, or Gresham's Law, or Grimm's Law. Telling people how they do talk is one thing; telling them how they should talk is quite another.   And from much earlier in the article:    people who get upset about violating Rule 1, the gender agreement rule, tend to be women, and men who don't feel like excluding women. The people who get upset about violating Rule 2, the number agreement rule, on the other hand, tend to be people who don't know much about language, of both genders.

Python,3cnama,xikly,7,Thu Jul 9 05:59:39 2015 UTC,"Hi xikly,  Classes are representation of real or abstract object, this means that can have member variables (that represents properties of the specific object) and functions that acts on its properties. For example the class Car has km and a function to ""walk"" that increases the km property.  Functions (outside of a class) should be intended to generic piece of code that are not related to a specific object. It is the case, for example, of the math module that contains generic operations.   Sometimes someone can force the concept of Object, including a generic function in a class, but conceptually that function can be applied to other classes. This could cause the replication of the function for other classes or decreases the ""readability"" of the code. For example, if you are writing a game, you can feel good to write a function Player.saySometing, and Enemy.saySometing. Could be better to have a generic function displayMessage."

Stop Writing Classes  http://bit.ly/1NQWJKk  Write More Classes  http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/2/13/moar-classes/  I personally find classes(and state for that matter) to be distasteful. The hitchhiker's guide to python notes that Python's module system(as compared to something like Java which uses the file system to load classes) gives the user a lot more flexibility in namespacing. Many folks use classes just to group behavior together(something like Django Managers). Python(as usual) provides a better way by delegating this concern to its robust module/package system.  With namespacing out of the mix the pitch for classes becomes much simpler.You use classes when you need to encapsulate state and provides behaviors on that state. You theoretically get some level of encapsulation by convention and re-use at the cost of mutability(which complicates concerns like caching and testing). I generally find the ""re-use"" argument to be meh because you can import functions wherever you need them and the encapsulation is voluntary.

Python,3cf9l1,nothingbutcontempt,13,Wed Jul 8 00:01:04 2015 UTC,"Here's a short one assuming you're familiar with coroutines:  The async before def read_data(db) makes read_data into a native coroutine and return a coroutine object when called just like generators return a generator object. e.g.:  >>> (i*i for i in range(1000000)) <generator object <genexpr> at 0x1096344c8>   await before db.fetch('SELECT ...') will suspend the coroutine until db.fetch completes and returns the result data.  All those functionalities are already in the language, this is just a new syntax to make coroutines more easily approachable.

Python,3cf9l1,skunkd,3,Wed Jul 8 14:18:43 2015 UTC,I'm going to answer you at risk of looking a fool because I don't understand it either & want someone to correct me. It's a coroutines implementation for python and it means the current thread of execution can continue even when the other routine has yet to return.
Python,3cf9l1,richcracker,2,Wed Jul 8 00:22:22 2015 UTC,"Ah I get it, thanks. Does it mean that async is starting a new thread when you call it?"
Python,3cf9l1,skunkd,2,Wed Jul 8 00:34:26 2015 UTC,I would assume so but maybe because of the GIL it's a complete new process. Probably just a thread though.
Python,3cf9l1,takluyver,8,Wed Jul 8 01:18:18 2015 UTC,"It's not actually a 'real' OS thread, and definitely not a new process.  Threads and processes are 'preemptive' multitasking: the computer can at any point stop one thread and switch to another. Coroutines, like in this mechanism, are 'cooperative' multitasking: a coroutine will keep running until it does an await on something to wait for some data (DB query, HTTP response, pipe, etc.). That returns control to the event loop, which waits for data to be ready for any of the coroutines, and resumes one when there's data for it to process.  This avoids some of the problems with writing code using threads, because it's more predictable when it will switch between bits of code. You can run threads or processes from your coroutines if you want, though."
Python,3cf9l1,skunkd,2,Wed Jul 8 03:09:10 2015 UTC,"That returns control to the event loop, which waits for data to be ready for any of the coroutines, and resumes one when there's data for it to process.   So in the above simple example the await on the query means the event loop will wait until the coroutine's returns anyway?"
Python,3cf9l1,takluyver,3,Wed Jul 8 08:19:12 2015 UTC,"In this line:   data = await db.fetch('SELECT ...')   The coroutine is running, reaches this line, and sends the database the 'SELECT ...' query. Now it can't do anything else until the database sends the results back. So the await pauses the coroutine and gives control back to the event loop, telling it that it's waiting for the result of the fetch call. Internally, that fetch call will have more awaits, right down until one of them is waiting for raw data to read from a socket.  The event loop stores this coroutine. When there's data to read on the socket, it will wake it up, feeding it that data. Somewhere inside the fetch call, the code will decide whether it has got the data for a complete result. If not, it will await some more data, giving the event loop the chance to do other things again. If the result is complete, the fetch() call returns it, and that example code would store it in data and carry on running."
Python,3cf9l1,skunkd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:25:56 2015 UTC,Thanks. I guess this would mean the series of nested awaits mean a lot of libraries would need to be rewritten in order to get the full benefit from any speedups?
Python,3cf9l1,takluyver,2,Wed Jul 8 15:23:35 2015 UTC,"Yes-ish: async libraries need to be written with some knowledge of the async framework in which they will work. But the async and await is a new syntax to support asyncio, a framework that is already in Python 3.4 (and can be installed in 3.3). There are already a number of libraries for asyncio - you should be able to use these with async and await immediately.  Technical details: I said that there will be a series of nested awaits. In current asyncio code, there's a series of nested yield froms instead. The async and await mechanism has been designed to work with current asyncio syntax."

So I'd move the frame opening and saving into a separate (handler) function. In this function you call the deepdream() too. Then create a multiprocessing.Pool instance and apply the handler function on the list returned by os.listdir() (and forget about frame_i += 1)  Something like this:  from multiprocessing import Pool  if __name__ == '__main__':     pool = Pool()     pool.map(handler, os.listdir(input))   So the pool applies the handler function on each path (so it opens the frame image, passes it to deepdream() then it saves the result to the disk).

Python,3cgocl,WaterSnake,5,Tue Jul 7 23:26:01 2015 UTC,"I think that ""no cleaner than any other mainstream language"" is utter codswallop. Languages like PHP and C are notorious for their ugly, inconsistent and downright perplexing designs full of special cases to memorise and surprising behaviour. There is nothing in Python like the C gotcha that variables can be both true and false at the same time.  (The closest you can get is if you write a custom bool or nonzero method which deliberately flips from returning True to False at random.)  All languages have their ""gotchas"". Sometimes they are design flaws in the language, sometimes the language is clean and consistent but people's expectations are not. Here are a few Python gotchas:   Default arguments to functions always use early binding. The practical consequence of that is that a default mutable container like a list is sometimes surprising: def spam(x, storage=[]) doesn't give you a brand new empty list each time you call the function, it reuses the same list each time. This is consistent with the rest of Python's behaviour, but people don't expect it. (This is probably the Number One most common Python gotcha.) In Python 2, Python will try really hard to guess what you want if you combine ASCII byte strings and Unicode text strings together. That avoids some trivial errors, but at the cost of creating even more, harder to diagnose, non-trivial errors. Python 3 corrects that. Backslashes in filenames won't do what you expect. filename = 'C:\Project\textstuff.py' contains a TAB character, not a backslash followed by t."

Python,3cgocl,stevenjd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:03:16 2015 UTC,"Your C example there is actually a great example of one of the more fundamental differences between dynamic and compiled languages which gets overlooked amongst the trivia of syntax: compiled languages tend to come with vastly better static analysis than dynamic languages.  Your example shows a variable being used before it has been assigned, which is indeed a potential source of extremely odd behaviour. There are better ones, like returning a pointer to a variable on the stack from a function, and watching its value change seemingly randomly during execution. However, it's one that you're unlikely to hit, because the compiler will tell you about it at compile time. Dynamic languages, in general, aren't very good at this.  Python's laissez faire attitude to interfaces is often presented as an advantage, but it comes at a huge cost in lost automation. One of those costs is the neverending quest for coverage in unit tests. In Python, the only way to know if a function doesn't exist is to run the code which tries to call it. This means, for example, that if you want to ensure that you don't have any typos in your debug log messages, you need to ensure that your unit tests call every... single... one of them. You just don't have to do this with a compiled language, because the tools do it for you.  There's an old joke: ""it compiled, so it must be good. Ship it!"". This is obviously not recommended :) However, if your program compiles without warnings, you can be sure that all your function, object, and variable names are correct. All functions and methods are called with the correct arguments of the correct type. Oh, and you haven't tried to use any variables before assignment, because that's undefined behaviour."

Yes, I've worked with Scala & Java programmers that don't spend nearly as much time building unit tests because they've got compilation to check many errors.  And so, because of this, I generally end up testing their code because it turns out that the compilation errors are usually the obvious & trivial ones, and you actually need that test coverage to handle business rules, field mappings, etc.  Bottom line: the complaint about dynamic language test hell is misplaced."
Python,3cgocl,kenfar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:19:19 2015 UTC,"compiled languages tend to come with vastly better static analysis than dynamic languages.   I suppose that's sort of true, except that's entirely a historical accident. It was a dynamic language, Smalltalk, which first came up with automated code refactoring tools, so there's no reason why dynamic languages can't have excellent static analysis tools. They can and do. Steve Yegge talks more about this.   the compiler will tell you about it at compile time.   Well, why didn't it? What sort of god-awful brain-damaged language allows the compiler to ignore the code you wrote because you used an uninitialized variable rather than just giving a compile-time error? So because the compiler doesn't tell you when you've done something which the compiler knows is stupid, you have to run a whole bunch of extra tools over your code looking for bugs the compiler has introduced.   One of those costs is the neverending quest for coverage in unit tests.   You still need unit tests and regression tests in static languages. The static type checker cannot tell if the code does what you want, it can only tell if the code is consistent. That doesn't mean bug-free, or correct. Consistency doesn't give you much: ""It compiles? Quick, ship it!"" is a joke for that very reason. The type checker is only capable of detecting the simplest, least important errors -- and as the success of dynamic languages makes clear, often they're not errors at all, except to the overly strict type system. (Why can't I add a float and an int in ML? Because purity. Even other static languages like Pascal and C allow automated casting of numbers.)  Before you mention it, I look forward to Python gaining some static type checkers with type inference. I'm not to proud to accept assistance from automated tools (perhaps too lazy, but not too proud). Type declarations are automated tests expressed in a declarative way, and if you add type inference to the checker, you can reduce (but not entirely eliminate) the declarations needed.   In Python, the only way to know if a function doesn't exist is to run the code which tries to call it.   Or, you could look at the source code and search for def the_function(. There's no reason why a static tool can't do that. I'd be surprised if static tools like PyLint, Jedi, PyChecker and friends don't already do that. It is a design decision that Python's compiler will delegate that to external tools, not a fundamental limitation of dynamic languages.   to ensure that you don't have any typos in your debug log messages, you need to ensure that your unit tests call every... single... one of them.

Python,3cgocl,stevenjd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:41:23 2015 UTC,"the compiler will tell you about it at compile time. Well, why didn't it?   Probably you didn't enable compiler warnings on your particular compiler. Ideally you wouldn't have to, but it's presumably not enabled by default for compatibility reasons. However, any modern compiler will warn about this. If you enable warnings and treat warnings as errors from the start, which is good practise, this code won't even compile.   What sort of god-awful brain-damaged language allows the compiler to ignore the code you wrote because you used an uninitialized variable rather than just giving a compile-time error?   See above, it does. Also, it's not ignoring the code you wrote: it's undefined behaviour. This doesn't mean that some compiler designed decided to be deliberately obnoxious just to spite you. It meant that in order to write better optimised code, they chose to ignore the case where the program is incorrect and optimise anyway. It's possible, for example, that your variable is being assigned to some register which, because it hasn't been initialised yet, the compiler feels free to re-use for other purposes. This would make it's value change seemingly at random.   So because the compiler doesn't tell you when you've done something which the compiler knows is stupid, you have to run a whole bunch of extra tools over your code looking for bugs the compiler has introduced.

However, testing interfaces is still a huge deal, and there's no point duplicating this work in unit tests. As a python developer who has come from C, I find the lack of this tool immensely frustrating.   Before you mention it, I look forward to Python gaining some static type checkers with type inference. I'm not to proud to accept assistance from automated tools (perhaps too lazy, but not too proud). Type declarations are automated tests expressed in a declarative way, and if you add type inference to the checker, you can reduce (but not entirely eliminate) the declarations needed.   Think about what 'static' means in this context. Python allows you to create new types at runtime. Not only that, people actually do it all the time. I think it would be very hard to write a robust static type checker for Python without significant changes to the language.

You just don't have to do this with a compiled language, because the tools do it for you. I would really like to see the language that can check for typos in log messages.   You have an automatic translation function called '_', and you use it without having imported it in the module. Python will happily run the code anyway without emitting any warnings, until it hits the missing function. This has happened to me several times, and it's exceptionally annoying: a customer reports a bug, but the only log message you get about it is a missing _ function."

If you, the human reader, can look at a piece of code and recognise that a function will or will not exist without actually running the code through an interpreter, then so can a static checker.  There may be some heavily obfuscated code, or ultra-dynamic code that uses exec all over the place, that is beyond even human intelligence.

A popular example is how default arguments are evaluated only once, when the function is defined, so this:  def foo(x = []):     x.append(""a"")     return x  foo() foo()   ...produces [""a"", ""a""] on the second run, not [""a""], because the empty list we passed as the default argument is modified in-place inside foo.

I moved onto using the Scripting language beneath it, JASS, at around 12 years old and the compile-to-JASS object oriented language vJASS soon after.  I tried to pick up perl at about 15 and found it a difficult language to understand or use.  However, I later found python around the time I was beginning my introductory Computer Science courses in Freshman year of College (my first programming course at 19 years old).  I found that I loved python, didn't dislike C++, and breezed through most classes in College.  I find that learning the first language is very difficult, and the programs I first wrote were horrendous.  It wasn't until I was writing vJASS that I even had the concept of a Linked List or any other data structure.  Now, I am 25, and working as a Computer Software Engineer.  To answer your question, I don't believe it is detrimental to learn ANY language.  If anything, the more languages you learn, the more you understand.  With your second and third language, there may be a slightly longer learning curve when being introduced a new concept, but your previous experience will snowball and you will end up learning the language faster than someone who has not programmed before.

Python,3cgocl,r_notfound,4,Tue Jul 7 21:36:35 2015 UTC,"I wanted to comment on this even though there are already several excellent comments, mostly because I have actually reversed my own view on this over the last few years.  A few years ago, I was a staunch advocate of the ""Learn C First"" school of thinking. As a bit of background, I started with various flavors of BASIC (built into the Commodore 64, the ROM BASIC in Apple IIe's, and gwbasic/basica on a 286.   I then moved on to C, and later C++, reveling in the additional power, but also early on rueing the manual memory management and off-by-one errors (not the mention the infamous missing semicolons and mismatched parentheses and braces).  I dabbled with Visual Basic for a while, learned Java, then Eiffel, later Python, followed by Erlang and then Ruby. (I dabbled with Perl somewhere in there, but hated it, and never did too much with it. Played with Objective-C, Haskell, and others along the way, but never really picked them up.)  At this point in time, my two ""core"" programming languages, that between them comprise 90+% of all development I do, are C and Python. I do a lot of low-level systems stuff, and I use Python for almost everything that isn't.  When I was new to Python, I really believed that until you deeply understood the underlying hardware, you couldn't be a proper programmer, and that the low-level understanding of things like memory management and pointers were foundational. That until you know those things, you weren't prepared to program effectively at a high level.  I have changed my view quite a bit over time however, mostly as a result of my experiences in trying to help teach several close friends to program. The biggest single factor contributing to my changed view is trying to lower the initial learning curve enough to let the new programmer get excited before they have to wade through the particularly dry bits.  I still firmly believe that a strong understanding of the computer hardware and operating system is crucial to being a great programmer, but I now believe that a lot of that knowledge can be obtained separately from learning the basics of how to program and a particular programming language.  One of the keys in learning seems to be for the student to be able to see demonstrable results from their efforts early on. The simpler it is to do something ""cool"" (let's face it, the high you get from writing ""Hello, World!"" wears off pretty quickly), the sooner someone really gets hooked and develops the motivation to really dive in.  The languages that I started with were actually quite good from that standpoint. BASIC on the Apple IIe was very easy to do graphics (even animation) in. Later, with C, I could at least do fancy console-mode stuff, because with DOS in real mode, doing colorful ASCII art stuff was just a matter of poking some values in memory (about the only thing I really miss, now that we've moved to protected mode).  In trying to teach others, I start with Python now. I find that the basics ""make sense"" enough for people to get it, and start building things and having fun. From there, you can always chase the esoterica. Python also has a very optimized backend implementation (things like getting the built-in sort implementation, ""timsort"" for free, versus writing one from scratch in C or trying to use the standard library qsort() function...) are a huge leg up. The fact that the basic data structures and methods are so optimized means that you actually can build fairly decent programs without being a machine expert. And while you've probably read it already (and will repeatedly, I'm sure) a better algorithm pretty much always wins out over micro-optimizations anyhow.  Learning how to organize a C struct in order to ensure that the compiler doesn't pad the struct innefficiently in terms of space and damage your page alignment or cache efficiency is a useful skill. But I really believe it's one that can come long after you learn how to do something fun while programming.  Regardless, you absolutely want to learn multiple languages. I think Python is a great first choice, but do learn something from the C family as well. Also, be sure to learn at least one ""functional"" language (I think Erlang is a great choice in certain ways, with the completely immutable ""variables"" it has). It will force you to think about solving your problems differently.  tl;dr Sure, learn Python first. Keep learning from there, add other languages, and pick up the low-level stuff as you can."
Python,3cgocl,rcoacci,6,Wed Jul 8 03:06:05 2015 UTC,"C IS simple as a LANGUAGE. What isn't simple is that you need to learn how computers actually work under the hood (pointers, memory allocation etc).

Python,3cgocl,stevenjd,2,Tue Jul 7 20:37:46 2015 UTC,"Why does python have so many ways to make a collection?   Because there are many different kinds of collection. You should see what's available in Java.   How come when I modified this tuple in this function here, I can display the change in the function, but the original is unchanged?   Eh, what? Tuples are immutable, you cannot modify tuples. You can only replace them with a new tuple, e.g. t = (1, 2); t = (3, 4) doesn't modify the tuple. So naturally the ""original"" outside the function is unchanged.  You can modify an object inside a tuple, e.g. t = ([], 0); t[0].append(23) but that change is visible regardless of where or how you reference that tuple. Naturally: you have modified the list, and the list is inside the tuple."

You may find yourself hating semicolons more than others who started on something else, but the languages themselves you just need to learn the basics of and it gets smoother from there.   The two hardest parts when learning new languages for me has been the paradigm shift and deployment, not really the code itself.   For paradigm shift example: Javascript is not hard to code, but require's understanding that by nature it wants to be asynchronous and silent failures, which feels very odd when coming from Python.   Deployment example: Python itself can feel as if has far to many ways to be deployed (script, wheel, egg, virtualenv vs system package, etc..), and a lot of other languages suffer the same problem cough Java cough"

The difference between doing something and doing nothing is far, far greater than the difference between doing ""something"" and ""something else"".  Pick a language. Use it. You will be better off. If you the time and inclination, learn something else, too. It will be easier once you're already in the habit of programming, the same way switching to a serious workout regimen will be easier if you've been haphazardly doing pushups compared to if you'd been sitting on a couch.

Python,3cgocl,LessonStudio,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:11:12 2015 UTC,"My first language was basic on a Vic-20. It had so many limitations that I soon had to make various leaps out to other languages such as assembly and eventually C to make my various early computers do what I wanted them to do.  But if I had started with python I suspect that I could keep making it dance and do what I wanted it to do. At this point I can only think of one thing that I presently do that I can't do on python which is to program embedded controllers with C++.   Even that last is soon to be python possible in that there are a variety of python capable arduino style devices coming out.  Now I don't use python for everything seeing that I do know other languages such as C++ that for certain things is just better.  So my theory for learning Python as your first language totally depends upon what you are planning on doing. For a scientist who may very well only ever use Python then it should be good. But for someone who wants to go into CS/CE. I don't think so.   I see the same thing with Java. There are many people who become very good at making it dance wherever they need a language. Thus they only know Java and see no reason to learn some other ""degenerate"" language."

Those early, small successes at getting the computer to do what you want to do can be really fun. However, learning involves hard work.   Sooner or later, you'll think of some logic and write some code that you think implements it, but when you try the code out, it's producing wrong results. You'll have to then dig into your code and figure out where the bugs are occurring and how to fix them. Did you forget to account for an edge case that you bumped into? Did you call that API incorrectly? Or maybe your logic is actually wrong in a subtle way that you didn't realize?  Learning is a lot of work, and that is rarely fun. It's not supposed to be fun.

If we omit that, the entire logic become under a dozen lines. Some of your additional length is justified (yours has liberal comments, my quick and dirty one does not). Other parts add a fair bit of code for minimal functionality gain, but were likely useful for learning (./passwords.py 8 3 10 > passwords.txt would have a similar effect and bypass a fair bit of your code).  One thing I did want to call out though was the duplication you introduced with multi_password and password_generator. There's no need for both. Just loop as many times as needed: if that's once, the loop will exit after one pass. I don't want to criticize what you did too much, as it looks like you did a great, careful job overall, and probably learned a lot, but I'm hoping that seeing how simple this overall task can be will be useful/interesting.

If you install Kitematic, you won't have boot2docker installed necessarily.  The other is I'm confused by why nginx is required on OSX. It seems like you'd want to require only docker, then encapsulate things like nginx in a container.  Here is some recent work of trying to come up with a minimal build for deployment: docker-deploy-python. A bit different focus, but maybe some use for reference. I haven't pushed it yet, but I have a python-builder container as well that uses pyenv to build python versions, that I plan to use in a testing container. The idea is to have a run container that only has what is required to run the app, not compile source files, or run tests, etc.  I'll also mention that dox, tox with docker, might be of some interest as well."
Python,3cfaxt,rothnic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:17:56 2015 UTC,"We decided to use boot2docker since it'd been around longer and Docker Machine is still billing itself as in beta. boot2docker hasn't exactly been a joy to use, so we'll definitely look into moving to Machine once it stabilizes.  I think it would be good to move nginx into a container eventually. This is quite a bit harder than the current solution, though, since you are now managing nginx's container lifetime while also keeping track of the various container IPs it needs to be connecting to. Currently, the only IP we need to keep track of is the boot2docker VM's, and this is pretty static relative to constantly shifting containers.  Thanks for those links, I'll definitely check them out. We could definitely use some improvement in our Python setup and build times in our setup internally. setup.py develop really doesn't cut it very well in a lot of cases."
Python,3cfaxt,OmniJinx,2,Wed Jul 8 15:53:27 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. The main thing that the images I was working on was extending off of someone else's work, then trying to add in using a minimal image (the official python one is ~600MB or something), and work in testing.  The build.docker builds all the wheels and stores them into your local machine, then then run.docker image includes just the base requirements and installs the wheels directly. The run image ends up being about half the size of the builder.  I tried utilizing conda to have direct access to compiled packages, but the conda binaries are not compatible with musl compiler, which is what all the minimal linux distros use.  In the end, I think not using the distro's python is the most robust, especially for testing against many versions of python via pyenv. I went ahead and committed what I have, which is incomplete for the testing side, due to an issue compiling 3.4.3. The python-builder.docker is basically pyenv encapsulated with all the build requirements for python, with the idea it could produce the compiled versions of python to use for testing."
Python,3cfaxt,rothnic,2,Wed Jul 8 16:10:11 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit baffled by some of the problems this purports to solve  You can use Docker containers rather than VMs under Vagrant for example  Also the routing, port forwarding and file sharing (at least for paths under /Users/) 'just works' on OSX already in recent versions of boot2docker... so why the need for an Nginx proxy and rsync?"
Python,3cfaxt,anentropic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:41:18 2015 UTC,"You can definitely run Docker containers under Vagrant. The big gain we have over Vagrant here is with our ability to easily choose which parts of the stack you want to run. It's easy in Dusty to only run the applications you care about and nothing else, and this is all done through a simple specs layout where each container is defined exactly once. We were having huge problems keeping things efficient without adding a bunch of complex configuration management on top of Vagrant.  As to boot2docker, its implementation of these features leave a lot to be desired.    The shared folders used by boot2docker are unbelievably, comically slow, which is why we ended up going with rsync for all file transfers. It would take us 20 seconds to run setup.py install over a tiny Python library because of how bad the I/O performance was. What we call port forwarding is actually a bit more involved, we work all the way from host name resolution to a port on a container. This means you can punch local.myapp.com in a browser on your Mac and have that transparently hook you into the running container. This was a huge usability gain for us, especially for our less technical users. It also makes it much easier to reason about where different services live since you don't just have a bunch of services accessible at localhost:<random_port>. This is all done out of the box and supported through our specifications schema.   There's a bit more information on what we see as our advantages here in our docs: http://dusty.readthedocs.org/en/latest/why-dusty/  edit: This is great feedback, though, thank you! I think we have a lot of room for improvement on our landing page right now. I think the difference between the OS X features of boot2docker and Dusty are night and day, but if the page isn't communicating that then it isn't doing its job."

Dusty will also manage the services you are not actively working on for you, to keep things up to date with a remote repo. You can override any of the services you'd like for active development, and then move them back into Dusty's control when you're done with your feature."
Python,3ch1vn,kristopolous,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:14:12 2015 UTC,"Cool, I browsed through the code and noticed a couple of things.   You should split your file into several smaller files, e.g. one for database functions, one for audio functions, one for the flask app, etc.  It looks like some of your functions, e.g. stream_manager(), would probably be better suited as classes. As a warning, manipulating bytes and doing things like stitching mp3s in python will work, but is in my experience painfully slow. I strongly suggest you look into existing tools like sox and ffmpeg. You can call them from inside of your python subprocesses and get something like a 10x speed increase.   Good luck!"

A few things:  I want a single portable file similar to youtube-dl with as few dependencies and installation ceremony as possible... Can you recommend a build system?  The class based approach ... Have any PEPs for me to look at?  And lastly, you are mistaken, but well intended, about the mp3 suggestion - I can process 5 hours of audio per second with the method I did. The insight is that I'm serializing parts of a file (stream) sequentially. I can ignore the fact that the payloads are audio.  The approach you are advocating would require decoding the payloads to raw audio (~ 1s per 5min), do audiofingerprinting (using OpenFP ~1s per 30sec), use some kind of algorithm to match them up (this is just a fast matching alg), then re-encode the audio (1s per 30sec) ... 1 sec of cpu gets you 0.003 hours instead of 5.000 (and it would have transcoding loss and was only ~70% accurate in my tests).

Python,3cak9z,CSI_Tech_Dept,3,Mon Jul 6 16:21:24 2015 UTC,"I don't get why python has such problem with moving from 2.x to 3.x.   ...because it's not backwards compatible? If my backend is working fine with python 2.7, and development has gone more into maintenance, why would I spend the time and money to convert it to python 3? What would the benefit be?  If you're making a new product, sure, there's little reason to not use python 3, unless you require one of the few remaining libraries that don't support python 3. But if you're talking about old code/existing products, there's virtually no benefit. If you're thinking performance, Python 3 benchmarks have generally been slower than python 2.x until very recently.  The problem is that Python 3 is a different language with different syntax."

Regarding python 3 and python 2 the difference I noticed is that python 3 is stricter, and you can actually write code that works on both, but you should write it in python 3 then make small changes to make it work on python 2. So I wouldn't call it as two different languages."

The whole ""future compatible / proof"" concept isn't one that I find any value in.  It's not like my current pyhon2.7 setup will stop working.  The whole unicode/byte thing with character encodings just confuses me.  The reason I haven't upgraded is that it looks like jumping into python3 introduces a lot of uncertainty without concrete benefits.  I'm willing to have my mind changed.  But I use python as a tool, and I'm pretty happy with my current one.  Switching to a new version potentially introduces some issues that will (at least temporarily, and perhaps permanently) put me behind schedule.  So why would I upgrade?"
Python,3cak9z,masterpi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:01:09 2015 UTC,"I see where you are coming from, but you could say the similar thing about other languages. I remember somewhat similar issue happened when they unicode support was added in tcl 8.1 (a language created at the same time as python that was created for the purpose to let you include it in your applications). It broke a bunch of stuff and people explicitly were using 8.0, but they continued to release new versions and eventually everyone fixed their applications and moved on.  The issue with unicode in Python is that version 2.x encourage to write a broken code. It doesn't distinguish between text and data. If you just use US-ASCII it works fine, but as soon as you try to represent text that can't be represented by US-ASCII it will break.  You should think of text and data as two different types, kind of like number 42 and string ""42"" supposedly they are the same but not really. You can encode number as a string and you can also decode string to be a number. You will prefer to use a number when doing calculations on it, but you would use a string when displaying it to the user.  Same with unicode. You have a text, but now unlike 2.x it can contain any characters even ones that are not contained in US-ASCII. You can do the usual operations on it and it behaves just as you would expect it to. But now if you need to do I/O (most commonly, reading/writing to files or reading/writing to sockets) you need to encode/decode it to/from binary that's what .encode() and .decode() are for. That's pretty much it.  I believe the biggest confusion comes from libraries that do the conversion implicitly for you (for example when you write to file, python will automatically encode it as UTF-8, or whatever you have defaults set to). I feel that perhaps if the conversion was more explicit less people would be confused about it.  Going back to other points there are many things in python 3 that are not obvious until you start working with it. Small stuff like modules called urllib2 is just called urllib. Instead of raw_input() you just use input(). Instead of xrange() you simply use range(), if you use threading.Event to wait for an event and user presses Ctrl+C your application won't be stuck and will simply exit/raise signal depending how you configured it etc.  As for the question whether you should you use python 3? I think you should give it a try, I personally find it much cleaner and more enjoyable to code, because a lot of cruft has been cleaned up.  As for converting existing application. It depends. You still will have bug and security fixes for the next 5 years. If the application doesn't do anything where security is a concern then why bother, you can have both python3 and python2.7 installed on the same system, so just point it to the right one. If the application is accessible from the outside, then you probably should plan on converting it. Python 2.7 supposed to be already unsupported right now, but the extra 5 years were added for that purpose.  Also, regarding writing applications that work on both version of python I personally found that best it is to write app in python 3 (which is stricter), then add:  from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function, unicode_literals   on top of every source file and the rest of incompatibilities fix with the six module."
Python,3cak9z,cflewis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:21:01 2015 UTC,"The move to Things beyond 2.7 broke a lot of dependencies, I suppose.   In other words, somethings work with Python 2.7 that don't work with 3.4/5 and vice-versa. Those who were using Python 2.7 back when they diverged didn't want to switch to the new version and try to get everything to work. There were a lot who decided to stay with 2.7 and a lot that went with the later versions. As such, 2.7 and 3.x are still supported.   That's how i understand it. Dependency issues."

Or it could have nothing to do with that, 2.7 is officially supported through at least 2020 and it's a completely viable option, so maybe they just haven't prioritized it because the 3.x enhancements, while nice from a language purist's point of view, don't offer a big enough business advantage in line with the cost of upgrading to get them."

Why is this the top comment?  The real reason is likely because they're not using stock CPython or have built a lot of stuff around 2.7 that is hard to port, combined with low value since most of their users are probably not that interested in 3.x yet since it would involve porting lots of legacy code."

I can't talk to the App Engine team's roadmap or if Python 3 will be supported, but If you have a very strong need for Python 3 right now, you could run it inside a Managed VM to get similar functionality.

That's why parsing JSON already produces dictionaries instead of some object hierarchy. And if the bracket syntax is really that annoying you could write a function to simplify it. One idea that comes to mind is using ""/"" as a separator between objects like the HDF5 (h5py) library does. Then you can do get_key(data, ""path/to/string"") or something like that."

Besides the obvious error checking like when parent is None, how _data is used seems really inconsistent and there is no __getitem__ on the Callable even though I think it is used in the init method. You set _data to name which I assume is a string, but then use it like a dictionary.  I'm curious as to what your use case is for this? I'd also suggest just subclassing a dict object and using bracket syntax if that ""feels"" ok to you.  Edit: Added more detail to not-working example part."

I will start with a very simple examples for those who might not have seen the syntax discussed.  def greeting(name: str) -> str:     return 'Hello ' + name   Within the function arguments, the type annotation is denoted by  a colon (:); the type of the return value of the function is done by a special combination of characters (->)  that precede the colon which indicates the beginning of a code block.  Slightly more complicated example (from [mypy])  def twice(i: int, next: Function[[int], int]) -> int:     return next(next(i))   We now have two arguments; it becomes a bit more difficult to see at a glance what the arguments for the function are.

Python,3c9ex3,taleinat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:10:41 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: pick a tutorial, stop, and learn by doing.  When I was in 10th grade I was just starting out in programming. I picked Python because it was, and still is, highly regarded. I worked through the little Python tutorial found in the docs and started writing little console applications for fun. That year I was in a class called EAST Lab that was all about developing and utilizing skills that would normally not be taught in public schools. I felt that console applications just weren't cutting it, and wanted to pick up some GUI skills, so I started learning Pygame (to this day I'm not sure how I overlooked Tk, but Pygame is still my favorite SDL library). I showed my instructor what I was learning in Python, she thought it was the coolest thing since sliced bread, and she let me start to propose and build my own projects for events at the school.  I'm telling you that to say this: learn by doing.  Tutorials are a great start! But no tutorial will teach you everything you need to know. Use the small tutorial in the docs, or a big one on YouTube. You're the only person who can really decide how you learn best. Skim over the suggestions here and then pick one (or find one elsewhere). Then, once you know the very basics, start making things. Anything at all! Make a BMI calculator, make a random number guessing game, make a BMI calculator that doesn't calculate BMI's at all but instead tells the person they're fine the way they are, make a random number powered matchmaking program that takes in two of your friends names and spits out whether they'd be a good match or not.   After you have made something, no matter how small, show people! Ask a teacher to come see what you've made. Show your friends how cool it is that you can make a computer do what you want it to (my friends loved the matchmaking program, it always caused red faces to appear). It doesn't have to be complicated or have a fancy GUI, people will be impressed with you taking the initiative!  Once you get comfortable with small console applications, pick up a GUI library (Tk seems to be popular, I liked Pygame myself). If your peers thought seeing white text appear on the screen was cool, they'll think you're a wizard when you show them a windowed application with your name on it.  Then, when you're comfortable with that, talk to some of your instructors about the possibility of creating a program for a school event. Make sure you have ample time, and that you are in a comfortable position, then hack away! My instructor let me create a GUI application (using Python and Pygame) that simulated a poll booth. We were doing an event for the younger kids to teach them about the election process. It was extremely simple yet had a big impact on the event; it boosted my confidence 10 fold!  Seeing people enjoy what you produce is a great part of any pursuit. The best way to do that (while still in high school) is through creating applications that have importance in your small network. They don't have to be big, or impressive, they just have to be.  I'm stepping down from the soap box now. I wish you luck, because I think it's awesome that you are pursuing this!"

There are also some high-level frameworks which implement such a plug-in system, e. g. live coding, and which trigger the reload when the source file changes.

Pyglet is much more ""modern"" or even ""pythonic"" than the C-ish Pygame (And you can run Pyglet on PyPI for better performance). There are bindings for SFML and Allegro, and they seem to be quite decent. Nevertheless, none of them are ""pythonic"".

Jamais vu is most commonly experienced when a person momentarily does not recognise a word or, less commonly, a person or place, that she or he knows.

They're used to create the Enum class that came out a few months back for Python 3.  I've used one to create a mutable struct class with less boilerplate.  Before:  class A:     def __init__(self, a, b):         self.a = a         self.b = b   After:  class A(metaclass=Struct):     def __init__(self, a, b):         pass   I've seen others do the struct trick too.  To be honest, they are rarely used and from what I've read, it's more for things like creating APIs.  It's still worth your time to read an article or two to get an idea of what they do.

Python,3c344g,ismtrn,22,Sat Jul 4 09:42:06 2015 UTC,"It was mostly meant as a joke.  It is inconsistent in the sense that every type has a program which satisfies that type. This is normally not a problem in a programming language.  In proof assistants such as coq or agda, you formulate propositions as types, and if you can write a program with that type you have a proof of that proposition. These languages are also dependently typed (I guess in order for the type system to correspond to an interesting logic? I don't really know that much about this), so types are also expressions which themselves have types. For example the type of 0 is nat and the type of nat is Set and the type of Set is Type in coq. In these languages you care about inconsistencies in the type system, because that means inconsistencies in the logic. If every type has a program, then every statement has a proof. That is no good. So you have a hierarchy of Type types, so that the type of Type is Type_1 and the type f Type_n is Type_n+1 in general.  It is a bit like Russel's paradox in set theory. If you do things the naive way you end up with an inconsistency. (i.e. you can prove all statements).  Of course this is moot in Python because python doesn't even have types in that sense."

Take a look at what modules are there so you know what's available to you, but generally you'll want to look up things as you need them, rather than attempt to read it though.  There are maybe a few core modules that you'll probably want to familiarise yourself as you get more experienced, but many of these are for specific purposes that you'll only need to care about if you're doing something in that area.

Python,3c09ro,the_hoser,23,Fri Jul 3 16:56:04 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with you on a few points.   Having optional static typing would likely lead to better performance anyway, so optional static typing is the one thing.   Not necessarily.  Due to the way types work in Python, all lookups are polymorphic in nature.  Knowing whether or not a value has an attribute doesn't change the way the attribute is retrieved.   Functions that use optional static typing could be optimized by the interpreter, and likely release the gil more often.   Type constraints have nothing to do with the GIL.  The GIL exists because the Python interpreter is not thread safe.  Attempts have been made to make it thread safe, but this resulted in a significant reduction in performance, so the proposals were rejected.  Believe it or not, the GIL is an optimization.   I'm really liking Haskell's type system. Instead of lists, it has something like python arrays but more flexible because they can contain any type, not just one or two byte things.   Yeah Haskell's pretty cool.  I've never been paid to write Haskell, though.   When does one ever need the flexibility of a real python list? 99% of the time, I either I have a variable length collection of all the same type (ints, strings, functions, dictionaries), or I have a fixed length collection of variable type (Haskell's tuple). In the rare occassion where you need a python list, it should be available, but it doesn't need to be the default.    Sequences and the native handling thereof are one of Python's greatest strengths.  Lists work the way that they do because that's the only way that makes sense in Python.   Python already has a type heirarchy, which we call duck typing.   No.  Incorrect.  Duck Typing refers to a lack of type hierarchy.  The idea is that, if an object appears to have all of the important components of the kind of thing you want, then it might as well be that kind of thing, for all intents and purposes.  The strength is in a lack of hierarchy.  You can still create class hierarchies in Python, but you don't have to.   Wouldn't it be nice if we could just explicitly state the interface expected in the function definition, and be as broad or narrow as we want?   I do believe that's one of the goals of the type checker being implemented for 3.5.  Dunno if it's going to actually appear in 3.5, of course, but these things take time.   Still, I'd really like to have a language that is Python, but with optional static typing, where the interpreter can do optimizations and type checking to notice something is off before a function is called during run time.   Nobody's preventing you from making another language.  The changes you want would require deep changes to the way objects work in Python.  When you were done, you'd end up with something that is not quite python anymore.  When talking about programming languages, it's really easy to get caught in the idea of ""just add feature X!"".  The reality is that these kinds of changes have much deeper consequences than what are readily apparent.  Lots of slow-thinking goes into adding features to languages, otherwise you end up with something like PHP.   Should I be downvoted to hell for saying this?   Probably not.  Will you?  I don't know.  My crystal ball is in the shop."
Python,3c09ro,DasIch,3,Sat Jul 4 06:47:01 2015 UTC,"Having optional static typing would likely lead to better performance anyway, so optional static typing is the one thing.   Not necessarily. Due to the way types work in Python, all lookups are polymorphic in nature. Knowing whether or not a value has an attribute doesn't change the way the attribute is retrieved.   Right now, but if there were static typing, the interpreter would know upon byte-code compile the details of what is happening.  So in c=a+b, python has to loo up the function that adds them from the variables at run time.  If the types of a and b were known at (byte code) compile time, the instructions would be ""create a new integer from adding these two integers"", rather than ""access the attributes of a and b, determine if the two can be added together, loo up and use the correct function to add these two"".

Attempts have been made to make it thread safe, but this resulted in a significant reduction in performance, so the proposals were rejected. Believe it or not, the GIL is an optimization.   Again, I think this probably has to do with the way all types need to be dynamic, but I admit to now knowing squat about this.  But numpy, cython, etc can release the GIL because they don't touch dynamic python objects.   No. Incorrect. Duck Typing refers to a lack of type hierarchy.    Well, you do have an explicit heirarchy though, since all classes derive from object or another class.  Really, pretty much everything just derives from object, so it's not very heirarchical.  But still, python already supports type inheritance in a way and one would benefit if the compiler knew if something walked like a duck and/or quacked like a duck at compile time.     When you were done, you'd end up with something that is not quite python anymore.   I agree.  Maybe it'd be like c++ython?"
Python,3c09ro,stevenjd,13,Fri Jul 3 16:58:47 2015 UTC,"Right now, but if there were static typing, the interpreter would know upon byte-code compile the details of what is happening. So in c=a+b, python has to loo up the function that adds them from the variables at run time.   No, it wouldn't.  In Python, classes are values, too.  This isn't like C++ where the type info is only used at compile time, then discarded unless you enable RTTI.  Because of this, all attribute lookups must be polymorphic.  The compiler can make no assumptions about it.  In the simple case of:  a = 1 + 2   Python can make assumptions.  It doesn't even need static typing to make these assumptions.  However in this case:  def f(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int:     return a + b   There is zero way for Python to know if the type is ""Int"" or some sub-type of Int.  Looking up and calling __add__ at runtime is the only safe way to go.   Again, I think this probably has to do with the way all types need to be dynamic, but I admit to now knowing squat about this.   I'll help you.  It has zero to do with types being dynamic.  It's a problem with the implementation of the interpreter, in C.   But numpy, cython, etc can release the GIL because they don't touch dynamic python objects.   This is incorrect.  They can release the GIL because they don't call into the Python interpreter until their functions are done.  They essentially function as ""not python code"" after releasing the GIL, and before re-acquiring it.  Static types have nothing to do with this.   Well, you do have an explicit heirarchy though, since all classes derive from object or another class. Really, pretty much everything just derives from object, so it's not very heirarchical.   It is a hierarchy.  A flat one, but it is one.  What I meant to say is that Duck Typing, as a concept, has nothing to do with type hierarchies.   But still, python already supports type inheritance in a way and one would benefit if the compiler knew if something walked like a duck and/or quacked like a duck at compile time.    I don't see how.  It still has to look up the attributes the same way.  The additional type information at 'compile' time would be... moot.   I agree. Maybe it'd be like c++ython?    Perhaps.  You should check out Nim.  It's got a lot of python-isms to it, and has static typing.  It compiles to C code, so it gets pretty decent performance, too."
Python,3c09ro,DasIch,2,Fri Jul 3 18:07:16 2015 UTC,"If the types of a and b were known at (byte code) compile time, the instructions would be ""create a new integer from adding these two integers"", rather than ""access the attributes of a and b, determine if the two can be added together, loo up and use the correct function to add these two"".   That addition will be faster is not enough of a benefit. Even if the addition itself is faster, the overhead introduced by the type system might slow the interpreter down so much overall that you end up being slower in practice and even if that doesn't happen and you get more performance how much will you get? This is a huge project and will take a lot of effort to implement and maintain, so that speedup better be significant.  Such performance optimizations can also be done completely without static typing as shown by the PyPy interpreter and all other interpreters using JIT compilation. Not just that a JIT compiler allows far better optimizations.  The GIL and static typing are completely unrelated. Advances in one are won't bring any benefits in the other.  Apart from that C++ is an absolutely horrible language. If you want types in Python you should avoid even the implication that Python will become more similar to it."
Python,3c09ro,stevenjd,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:24:12 2015 UTC,"There is no runtime overhead of the static type declarations.  Well, to be pedantic, there may be a tiny overhead, mostly in memory. The type annotations are stored in the function object, for later introspection if you want to. (E.g. the interactive help() function may learn to use them.) And of course you are free to write your own runtime type checker, if you wish. But the Python interpreter won't do a thing with the type annotations except store them in the function body.  The reason for PEP 484 is to provide a standard set of type annotations and conventions so that third-party tools can agree on how to do static typing. At the moment, static typing in Python is a mess. Every project has different conventions for how to annotate functions with type information, mostly using docstring conventions. This will allow any type checker, IDE or text editor to agree that ""this variable is a str"" and allow type checkers to compete on functionality, not argue about syntax.  The Python compiler/interpreter itself will not do any type-checking.  Guido has been extremely clear that PEP 484 is not about turning Python into a worse Java, and that it is about adding standard conventions for type declarations to prove program correctness, not performance.  If there is any performance benefit at all, it will be as a side-effect."

Python,3c09ro,jringstad,3,Sun Jul 5 06:13:34 2015 UTC,"Not really.  Not if you consider the tradeoffs that were considered at the time the choice was made.  The GIL provides an optimization for what, at the time, was considered the most important performance metric: single core performance.  Python was, first and foremost, a scripting language.  99% of the software written in it was single-threaded, so python was optimized for that software.  This may no longer be the case, but changing python to accommodate a completely new application paradigm is no small feat.  The single-threaded nature of Python is in it down to its DNA.  Removing the GIL would not only hamper the performance of the interpreter, but it would cause a whole host of problems that are very difficult to predict.  I personally think that we should get off the whole ""multi-threaded python"" bandwagon anyway.  Remove the GIL.  Remove threading while you're at it.  I don't think that this is a problem Python will ever be good at solving.  Better to focus on its strengths."
Python,3c09ro,Brian,4,Sat Jul 4 02:40:16 2015 UTC,"No, it is the absolute right way to put it. Without the GIL, CPython is tens of times slower. We know this because people have removed the GIL from CPython and it has been much slower.  If you want to use Python the language without a GIL, use one based on a different virtual machine. Neither IronPython nor Jython have a GIL."
Python,3c09ro,seekoon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:30:33 2015 UTC,"It is ten times slower without the GIL because they removed the GIL without actually fixing the underlying problem cpython has that made the developers put the GIL there in the first place. They removed the GIL and put an even less efficient mechanism in its place.  If you actually broke API compatibility and removed the shortcomings of the CPython C API that lead to the GIL in the first place, CPython would become faster.  So that's like having a diesel car that is capped to drive no faster than 80km/h, and then saying it's an eco-feature that helps environmental friendliness, when everybody else is producing electric cars."
Python,3c09ro,stevenjd,4,Sat Jul 4 04:50:34 2015 UTC,"without actually fixing the underlying problem   The underlying problem is that of thread safety, and that's a problem that exists, and that you really have to solve some way in pretty much any language (at least a higher level one where you can't leave it up to the coder).  There are really only 3 (current) options for this: coarse-grained locking (ie a GIL), fine-grained locking, or something more exotic like STM.   They removed the GIL and put an even less efficient mechanism in its place.   Yes.  Because the GIL is the most efficient (in terms of single core performance) possible way to solve this problem - there's really no way that could be avoided.  The advantages of the other approaches are to get better multi-core performance by not requiring your computation to be CPU bound, but they inevitably come with a single-core performance cost, because you're unavoidably doing more work.  The reason a coarse grained approach is always going to be faster than fine-grained for single-core performance, is simply because there's less bookkeeping to do: it's one lock acquire/release cycle for the whole bytecode operation - absolutely trivial.  That isn't really somethng dependent on the API or implementation (though potentially that could effect how much it makes the tradeoff), but an inevitable fact from the situation that this is doing pretty much the minimum work that gets you thread safety.  Now, there are some things about the python interpreter's implementation that can make the cost of fine-grained (or other approaches) more costly than usual, but just breaking the API isn't enough to get there.  The major one is likely the reference counting, since this requires modifying objects on every access, which requires a lot of lock/release cycles.  However, even without that, python's semantics are such that you're probably going to have a slowdown no matter what, and you'll likely need to do a lot of work to minimise this.  In some cases, people have done that work, and python implementations can piggy-back on the lock tuning of things like the java or c# runtime, but they're still paying a price for single-core performance.   If you actually broke API compatibility and removed the shortcomings of the CPython C API that lead to the GIL   PyPy has actually done this.  And they still use a GIL.  Like I said, it's not just some C API mistake that leads to this, there are genuine performance advantages to a GIL for single core performance that nothing else is going to be able to match.  Multi-core performance may be worth this, but it is going to be a tradeoff.  At the time python was written, when multiple cores were only a feature of supercomputers, this was essentially a tradeoff with no downside.  This does, however, bring up the third approach I mentioned, since pypy is experimenting with adding STM, which is a more modern, experimental approach.  This does come at a cost for single-core performance (last figures I saw were 20% to 300% slower, though that may have improved since), but may be a good approach for something like python.  It's never going to be free though - you're always going to slow down single core somehow.   So that's like having a diesel car that is capped to drive no faster than 80km/h   I don't know, ""top speed"" sounds more like a single-core speed applicable analogy, when really, the GIL is the approach that doesn't limit this.  A better analogy would be that it's something that makes the car go 20km/h faster, but doesn't allow you to have other cars on the road, making it slower to shuttle multiple-car loads, even if the individual car is faster.  Fine grained locking allows multiple cars, but means they all have to drive slower because they have to keep checking their mirrors etc, and stopping at traffic lights so they don't crash into each other.  STM let's them avoid this, and basically lets them crash when things don't work out, but is set up so it can get the wreckage off the road and rebuild the car as it was before the crash happened."

Python,3c09ro,Brian,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:08:11 2015 UTC,"That's a ridiculous way of thinking of it. It's not ""capped"" to run no faster than a certain speed.  The fact of the matter is that in the reality we live in, the GIL is an optimization. Could CPython have been designed differently so that a GIL was unnecessary and it would be faster? Sure it could have. But PyPy was designed differently, and it still needs a GIL. GIL or no GIL, PyPy is about ten times faster than CPython and about 100 times more complicated to maintain. IronPython and Jython were also designed differently, and they don't have a GIL, but neither is significantly faster than CPython. Jython is a little slower, IronPython is a little faster, sometimes, and a lot slower, sometimes.  Please feel free to fork CPython and ""fix the underlying problem"" and remove the GIL. I look forward to seeing your blazingly fast version of Python. Don't let the mere fact that other developers have tried, and failed, before you give you the impression that maybe it's not as easy and straightforward as you think."
Python,3c09ro,DasIch,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:20:17 2015 UTC,"But PyPy was designed differently   It was actually not designed differently, that's why it still needs the GIL. It's C API wants to be compatible with CPythons. So PyPy inherits all the mess of unsafe global variables CPython has in its C API. The same issue applies to e.g. stacklesspython.   PyPy is about ten times faster than CPython   I don't see how that's relevant. All it proves is that CPython is slow in more than one way. Complete strawman.   IronPython and Jython were also designed differently, and they don't have a GIL, but neither is significantly faster than CPython.   Yes, these actually were designed differently. But again, that they are faster or slower than CPython (I don't know which is the case) is not really relevant. It only really makes sense to compare CPython to CPython, pypy to pypy etc.  Also, if your benchmarks do not include threading, it's not particularly surprising that IronPython/Jython would not end up being faster. Add 8-way threading to the benchmark on an 8-core machine, and you will see that IronPython/Jython will be 8x faster than CPython (or even faster than that, because CPython can sometimes experience a slowdown when threads are used.)   maybe it's not as easy and straightforward as you think.   I know exactly why it's not easy and straightforward... but do you? Hint: The reason has nothing to do with writing code, threading or maintainability.  Also, if you re-read all my posts, you will see that I have nowhere claimed that it's easy or straightforward. You're just making a poor attempt at putting words in my mouth."
Python,3c09ro,billsil,3,Sat Jul 4 13:52:02 2015 UTC,"It's C API wants to be compatible with CPythons   No, it doesn't.  pypy made a complete break with the C API (there was some later work on a compatibility layer to try to allow python modules to work, but this comes at a performance cost, won't always work, and isn't the recommended approach).  Instead, the preferred way is using the CFFI interface.  As such, the C API was nothing to do with the reason they went with a GIL.  There is some work currently on making a GILless version of pypy, using STM instead.  Currently it does come at a performance cost though (20% to 300% last time I looked).   Add 8-way threading to the benchmark on an 8-core machine, and you will see that IronPython/Jython will be 8x faster   Definitely not - you'll never get linear speedups unless you're perfectly paralellizable, if then (in which case, you may as well fork anyway, since you're not sharing anything).  And because you're using interpreter state, you're not going to be perfectly paralellizable.  More reasonably, you might get 2-4 times faster if you're lucky, depending on the problem.  But the point being made is that you're paying for that with a penalty to single-threaded performance, and that the GIL is, in fact, an optimisation for this case.  It's an optimisation that comes with a price for parallelizable tasks, but no-one said it was a global optimization."

Python,3c0cm7,Kopachris,3,Sat Jul 4 07:02:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Dict + List  + (named)Tuples cover many, many use case.  Espacially for classes that do mostly aggregation of data, with very few processing. You can store functions in data structures, and functions as attribute of function, and return functions from functions you generate on the fly. And you can pass all that around. And you got decorators, and context managers, and iterators, and generators...   Plus, Python has crazily powerful datastructures in the stdlib (deque, heapq, sets, OrderedDict...) and even simple ones are incredible. Check the counter :  import os import pathlib  def get_extensions(path):     for dirpath, dirnames, files in os.walk(path):         for name in files:             ext = pathlib.Path(name).suffix             if ext: #                  yield ext  Counter(get_extensions('/etc')).most_common(9)  # Out :   # ('.conf', 632),  # ('.0', 348),  # ('.gz', 323),  # ('.jhansonxi', 207),  # ('.pem', 177),  # ('.load', 127),  # ('.ttb', 86),  # ('.ktb', 80),  # ('.kti', 55)]   Not to mention libs like SortedContainer or HyperLogLog that gives you even more data strutures in case you were feeling underpowered.  Hand made classes are great, but they are often overused. I now only make my own classes when :   I want a very specific API and I know classes will let me pack a beautiful one. I have many operations related to a common state. I need a namespace for code organisation. I want my lib user to have the hability to use custom objects while following a strict API.   It seems a lot of use cases, but in reality, it's mostly part of lib code, but it's not often needed for day to day plumbing usage code."

Python,3c0cm7,Damgaard22,6,Sat Jul 4 15:38:02 2015 UTC,"After six months I understood quite well the basics of the features python offers. Loops, magic methods, generators versus iterators, some of the stuff that goes on under the hood. But I couldn't read other people's code and hated having to do it (I mean, I'd still rather write code than read it, but I feel confident in my ability to do so). There were also a lot of missing spots in my knowledge. I didn't quite understand algorithms, I didn't understand computer science and math well enough to be able to pick up any book on a subject that interested me and understand it without feeling hopeless, and I had a difficulty understanding when and when not to use classes (and the best way to do so). I began to learn more about functional programming at this point, too.  After a year, I felt overwhelmed by projects that were between 200 and 500 lines of code. But it wasn't because of the language, it was because of my mind. It was a second learning experience, but one in which the concepts I had to learn wasn't as clear cut as the concepts of the language (what's a loop, what's recursion, what's a magic method).  There was maybe a second wall when it came to 500 - 1000 line programs. I discovered proper debugging tools too late, I think. In many ways I had to force myself to relearn things that I'd taken advantage of. Really read through documentation and such even if I feel like I know 75% of it. But now I can see a lot of the theory and stuff that I learned sink in on a meaningful level. Like, there's a bridge between theory and practice where they've become one.  Two years since I started, I'm working on a few projects to showcase on github to help me land a job. But I still feel overwhelmed sometimes. I started a project recently that made me realize I basically had to implement a minicompiler. And I didn't know anything about compilers, so I spent a few months learning about it and there was just so much I didn't know, about nondeterministic finite automata and lexing versus parsing that I still feel like I don't really get programming.

There are a lot of modules there that you will never need, but that's different for everyone based on what you are working on.  Know that an even better resource than the PyMOTW is the Python Standard Library Tutorial, which is really a ton of mini tutorials. However, for many libraries documentation is terse and sometimes inelegant or downright unpythonic.   The next place to go is PyPI for 3rd party libraries, which are often cleaner, more modern, and more well maintained than the standard library. See Requests. This is for compatibility, security, and release cadence. A lot of 3rd party modules are incomplete and/or outright abandoned so use google and your own judgment.  Eventually you must graduate to using help, inspect, and reading the source to get the most out of the standard library modules you use.

You shouldn't just choose the popular ML algorithm du jour and throw it blindly at your data, expecting decent results. Any first-year meteorology student would tell you that that daily max/min temperatures are highly autocorrelated in time - especially at a site like PDX in the Pacific Northwest. Furthermore, it's very easy to predict when persistence will dominate in timeseries of such data, just by looking at the large-scale flow field over the Pacific ocean (omega block setting up? weather ain't gonna change for a week or two), or to predict when a shock will propagate through and break the autocorrelation/persistence patterns (again, looking at the flow upstream).  In ten lines of code applying some basic statistical analysis, anyone could have an algorithm which consistently beats this application of ANNs.

The real solution is x = (AT A)-1 AT y, but with a non-linear least squares solver, it wont actually muck about with the matrix inversion."

Python,3c0m7b,Calime,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:56:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this is obvious but, how would you use numpy.linalg.solve to invert a matrix?"
Python,3c0m7b,Calime,2,Sat Jul 4 14:53:12 2015 UTC,"You can do it by solving MX = 1 with M your original matrix, 1 a square unity matrix and X, the inverse. But this is inefficient and dumb to calculate it this way.  What I was saying is that USUALLY (i.e. in MOST of the cases), calculating the inverse is just a step in your whole calculation. In other words, USUALLY people want to calculate the inverse to use it in other calculations. If that's the case, I'm saying that you should AVOID explicit inverse calculation because this is not efficient and error-prone. Instead you should reformulate your problem to use other tools as numpy.linalg.solve.  In the unlikely case that you need the inverse per se because this is the ultimate result of your calculation, then you should calculate the condition number of your matrix to know whether this inverse would be ""exact"" or not. If your matrix is ill-conditionned, there is mathematically no way to be sure that the inverse you obtained is sound and ""true"".  But as I said, fortunately, actual matrix inversion is seldom needed: you should find other ways to go through the calculation. Most of the time, solving things directly (instead of inverting) is enough."
Python,3c0m7b,Calime,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:30:40 2015 UTC,"Sorry again to ask such an obvious question (this isn't my area of expertise), but what does the condition number tell me? If my matrix is ill-conditioned, what is the correct thing to do?"
Python,3c0m7b,Calime,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:39:51 2015 UTC,"No no: asking this question means that you are begining to understand things ;-) that's great!  The condition number, for matrix inversion, is a number which expresses how much the calculated inverse would change if values of the original matrix are changed a tiny bit.  To say it otherwise, this is a way to estimate how sensitive the output (inverse matrix) considering is with regard to errors in the input. So if your matrix is ill-conditioned, you can't calculate an inverse that you can trust. If you really need this inverse all alone, you can say ""this matrix is ill-conditionned, if you really want to get an inverse of that, you'd better generate one randomly: it's faster and as meaningful"". If you need the inverse as a step in your calculations, you have to express this calculation in another way in order to avoid inverse calculation all together.  Don't forget that   M x = B and inv(M)B = x  are mathematically equivalent. But in computer programming the first one is well conditionned and x can be extracted using np.linalg.solve whereas the second case is ill-conditionned because of the explicit inversion.  But first things first. Matematically, for an inverse to exist, you need to determine if your input matrix IS invertible: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix  One way to figure out is to calculate its determinant which should not be null. If the determinant is null (equal to zero), then the inverse does not exist.  For instance:  M1 = array([[1, 1], [2, 2]])  is not invertible. Normally, if you try to get an inverse from that, numpy will scream that it is not invertible.  But now, what would happen if M was defined as follows:  M2=array([[0.999999, 1.000001], [2, 2]]) ?  Numpy wouldn't scream anymore since in all rigor this matrix IS invertible: maths say so!  But in computers, maths are often slightly betrayed... In this case, if you try to change any number even the tiniest bit, you will get a completely different inverse because we are very close from an unstability. So even the slightest error in your input will generate completely different numbers.  What does that mean? It means that you cannot trust the resulting inverse, you just can't. It may also mean that in reality, you matrix is not invertible at all but that the calculation was carried out anyway because of rounding errors: it is not uncommon to get M2 on computer due to rounding errors while exact calculations would give M1 instead.  The condition number for matrices is a way to tell you whether your input matrix is invertable but taking errors into account.  I can try to explain more if you want but I'm curious: why donyou need to explicitely calculate the inverse of you matrix?"
Python,3c0m7b,Calime,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:13:13 2015 UTC,"I am doing matrix complication with two vectors and a matrix. The data vector is d and the matrix is S.   So, the equation I am trying to code is dT * S-1 * d, where matrix multiplication applies, i.e. d is a vector shaped (1,1000), the transpose dT is (1000,1), and the matrix S is shaped (1000,1000).   The values of the matrix are of magnitude e-16, so I suspect this is why my matrix is so ill-conditioned. Otherwise, it should be invertible....all values are real and positive.   I think the best thing to do is (1) to multiply all matrix entries by e+17, and then (2) instead of inverting the matrix S, solve Ax=b where the solution x is x = solve(A,b) (e.g. in Python, numpy.linalg.solve() ),   For my equation inverse(S) * d, that is actually solve(S,d).   Ax=b, x=solve(A,b)=inverse(A)b Inv(S)d is solve(S, d)  Any other ways to make my ill-conditioned matrix well-defined? At the moment, the condition number is e+19."

Also, if you are worried about ""acceleration"" you should be using Cython not PyPy (JIT v highly optimized C/C++ code, never used PyPy though and Cython does require quite a bit of initial effort to get all the pxd/pyx/hpp to play nice together with large C++ libraries).

Python,3by7ub,HungoverOrDrunk,2,Fri Jul 3 03:41:56 2015 UTC,"Additionally there are many helpful links on the sidebar, including /r/learnpython.  I've also found that sites like http://www.codewars.com/ can really help one ramp up on a language's syntax."
Python,3by7ub,HungoverOrDrunk,3,Fri Jul 3 04:11:35 2015 UTC,"OK.  The main thing is to understand WHAT you want to do.  Since we're looking for all factors, what we really want to do is look through all the numbers from one to the target, and try to divide target by that number.    so if i begins at one, target / i will be evenly divisible, because all numbers are divisible by 1.  Next we'll set i to two, and see if target divided by two is evenly divisible.  Now that we can describe the problem in English, we need to think a bit about how in Python we can make these things happen.  It seems we've got three problems:   How to get an integer input from the user How to count from one to that value How to tell if the target is evenly divisible by the counter.   That's the algorithm, and Google is almost never helpful in this part. Learn to write the algorithm in English first, clearly and succinctly, and then convert the algorithm to the language in question.  In python 2, You get input from the user with the  raw_input() command.  Look it up if you don't know it.    target = raw_input(""What number do you want to factor? "")   One issue, is the raw_input() always returns a string, and this is a good thing.  However, you need an integer.  Again, Google will help you find the function for turning a string into an integer.    target = int(target)    This will work, or you can combine the input and the integer conversion as you'll see later.  Getting it to count is pretty simple in python. You have the wonderful range function.  However, when you look it up, you'll discover it doesn't work exactly like you need.  for i in range(target):     print i   This will return the values from 0 to target -1.  WHat we need is 1 to target.  There are a couple of ways, but the easiest is to simply modify the range statement (You know you can do this because you looked at the docs and google, right?)  for i in range(1, target + 1):     print i   Now we're getting somewhere.  The next point is to figure out if something is evenly divisible by something else.  Turns out the answer to this isn't really a programming thing, but a math thing.  There's an operator you should have learned in grammar school but probably didn't called modulus  Modulus (or mod) is WONDERFUL.  Programmers use it all the time.    The mod operator (% in python and many other languages) gives the remainder of an integer division.  So 5 % 2 is 1, because the remainder of 5 / 2 is 1.  6 % 2 is 0, because it has no remainder.  AHA!!  SEE IT??!!  (Sorry to yell, I just get so excited by this stuff...) Look through every number and if the mod of target divided by that number is zero, the target is divisible by that number.  Your professor shouldn't teach you how to do this problem.  He SHOULD teach you how to think about this problem, as I'm trying to do.  I've written the code for you, but because I care, I'm not going to give it to you yet.  Try to work it out with the hints I've given (which are plentiful.)  If you're still stuck, send me you thought processes, and I'll send you more hints, or my code to look at.  NOTE: HungoverOrDrunk's code will work great, and it's the 'Pythonic' way to do this.  (using a marvelous technique somewhat unique to Python.)  But I think at this point the goal should be to learn how to think through an algorithm and turn it into code.  Once you can do that fluently, get as fancy as you want.    ANOTHER NOTE: If you're in Python 3, the idea is almost exactly the same, but the syntax is slightly different.  Don't panic.  It's easy to learn the differences.  Give it a try, and if you're stuck, we can help."

From my reading and scanning so far, it seems like you are doing the work of covering all sorts of edge cases, which seems like it would be really useful for an experienced developer to step into Python and understand the subtleties.  Here are a few layout comments. The layout looks nice, and I presume it is set up for publishing in a physical book. However, when reading as a PDF, it is weird that the page contents shift with different margins back and forth. Additionally, many of the code examples seems to extend well into the margins.  I didn't exhaustively read the section on unicode vs bytes, however I did see that you cover the differences in Python 2 and 3. I may have missed it, but I think modern, forward-thinking Python should probably be written with from __future__ import unicode_literals. Then byte strings (which are less common as literals) as prefixed with b, instead of every normal string with u. However, this might be hard to cover and ""use"" in small code examples.  It felt a little weird using python2 and python3 instead of ""python 2"" and ""python 3"". Also, I in one headline I noticed ""Unicode Pirmer"" instead of ""Unicode Primer"".

This is one of those cases where ""practicality beats correctness"".

FWIW, I used Python 2.6 at the startup I worked at, but all the while I was learning new things in a book with Python 3 code in it. It never tripped me up.

I think the most compelling thing about suitcase over construct is that it provides a more familiar syntax then that provided by construct and with less repitition.

Python,3bv6le,heyalexej,2,Thu Jul 2 12:26:55 2015 UTC,"Separate branches on distinct servers will give you good results with relatively low effort.  I would start by introducing the tooling (if you don't already have it) to record the metrics you care about. It doesn't have to be sophisticated--throw up Graphite, Prometheus, InfluxDB, or whatever to record raw metrics. Where you need more detail than time series data can provide, log the relevant information somewhere (this is actually a good application of MongoDB). Make sure that when you're recording this information, it's somehow qualified by which system/application/environment/whatever produced it.  Once you're recording the information you care about, make branches for your new UI components. Deploy them to distinct systems. Choose a strategy for diverting traffic to your experimental UI--it could be something as simple as sending users with even-numbered IDs to one side and odds to the other, diverting the most or least active users, or even a random selection. What's important here is developing a strategy that makes sense in the context of the changes you want to test.  With that done, store the (ideally, simple) data you're going to use for routing traffic in a cookie. Configure your front-end load balancers to route based on the cookie presented by clients. At this point, you've got traffic flowing to both mainline and experimental versions of the application and you can observe the effect on your metrics. If you want to test on a grander scale--for example, suppose you believe Europeans use your application much differently from how Americans do and you want to confirm experimentally--you could substitute GLB for cookie-based routing.   In principle, you could run as many experimental instances of the application as you like to see how it impacts your outcomes. Just take care to only change one or two variables at a time (say, the layout of a single form, or the style of a common UI element) so you can be confident in the independence of your observations."

The reason for this is that it does 99% of what I want. So for something like flappy bird or 2048 Kivy completely rocks. For a huge chunk of the top 100 games it would probably be fine.   Thus Kivy is pretty damn good.  But where it lets me down is that I can't do certain things. I do procedural generation where I need pretty much every ounce of horsepower the CPU can provide. I access APIs that are a pain to get to at the best of time such as bluetooth. So for my odd requirements it isn't ready.  That said, I also have a few quibbles with Kivy. I find that getting the environment set up is just not as clean. I personally use Cocos2d-X and the environment there for iOS is a dream when it comes to going from nothing to testing helloworld on an iPhone. The cocos2d-x environment is a bit fiddly for Android but nearly everything android is fiddly.   But seeing that I do much of my back end programming in Python it would be dreamy to be able to do all my front end programming such as apps in in Python as well; not to mention better code reuse.  No doubt there are a zillion people with a zillion demands on the Kivy people but here are my two requests. Streamline the installation. My time from download to first helloworld on my iPhone was not a smooth process. My second request it a much much faster release cycle. Even if these are minor bug fixes.

Python,3bum53,Skull_Face,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:39:57 2015 UTC,How do you go about sending data to the backend? A REST API formatted as JSON?
Python,3bum53,LessonStudio,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:09:08 2015 UTC,"First you save the word REST for your resume. Basically the easiest way is to just set up a web server running some kind of ability to respond to posts and gets. PHP or Python and Flask would be two great examples.   So let's say you have an app that wants to know a given element from a database on the server (in this simple example we are asking for 3rd element). So you send it this JSON:  {   ""index"": ""3""  }   Then you would have a PHP script at the other end that would do something like:  <?PHP    $data=json_decode($some_string_with_your_incoming_json);    $some_string=GetSomethingFromDatabase($data->index);    //Now let's build an associative array to hold the outgoing data    $out_array['SOMETHING']=$some_string;    $out_array['HELLO']='There';    $out_json=json_encode($out_array);    echo $out_json; ?>   Which should then instantly return to your app something like:  {      ""SOMETHING"": ""Whatever the database pooped out."",      ""HELLO"":""There"" }   Which your app should be able to process.  Obviously the above code would need a pile of data checking, error, and exception handling.  If your data is very simple you can even skip the JSON. Let's say you had an app (pretty stupid) that would give you the population for any given city. You could have a POST with the city code and the server could just spit out the population as a number.  But the beauty is that most JSON libraries are getting very fast, plus JSON when pretty printed is usually easy on the eyes for debugging. But a huge benefit of JSON when it comes to an app is that if you release a new version of the app it is possible to add new fields to the JSON which previous versions of an app can ignore. Thus some changes to your data output won't break your app."

Rather, kivy-ios compiles the python interpreter itself and packages this, then all the python files are included without modification (except possibly being converted to .pyo first for a small efficiency boost). The app is then run via an objc bootstrap that creates and displays kivy's opengl surface, in a way transparent to the developer (there's nothing extra to do).

Python,3btqkz,remy_porter,3,Thu Jul 2 02:35:33 2015 UTC,"This doesn't particularly sound silke an API. This sounds like navigation. These are distinct and importantly different things.  An API is a programming interface- the purpose of an API is to allow a client to interact with your service on their own terms. A successful ""login"" operation, for example, shouldn't ""move"" them anywhere- it should return an authentication token they can use for future operations. If it fails, the client should receive an error.  Navigation is usually how a user interacts with a web application (which may be backed by an API). Navigation, much like an API, wants to let the client control the experience as much as possible, and to that end, navigation focuses on using client-side redirects to tell the client where it should actually go.  In both cases, an important concept is the idea of an ""end-point"". An end-point is a place where clients send requests to (whether the request is to an API or for a page is irrelevant). From the client's perspective, an end-point should represent the terminus of their request. The main reason to redirect at that point is to inform the client that they are not in the correct place- that there is a better end-point to complete the servicing of their request. A server side redirect is when the end-point is correct, but the server-side code needs to dispatch the request someplace else for handling.  Use client-side redirects when you honestly have completed your interaction with the client (for this operation), and want to have the client start a new operation from a different entry point. Use server-side redirection when the operation is not yet complete, and needs to be handled by a different sub-process.  In your specific example- if a login succeeds, the operation is complete. You want to start a new operation, from the home page, thus you should client-side redirect.  On the login failure, however, the operation is NOT complete. Thus, the server side should resend the login page to allow the user to try again. If the user fails too many times, then the server should decide the operation is complete (in a failed way), and redirect the client to a ""too many attempts"" page (client side redirect)."

Python,3breuf,billsil,2,Wed Jul 1 16:28:14 2015 UTC,"Currently, if you compare the native code execution of NumPy and the at runtime generated SIMD (sse4) code of PyPy, it would show the following behavior: PyPy (no vector) 1.0x speedup, PyPy (vector) ~1.5x speedup, CPython (NumPy) ~2.0x speedup. So the auto vectorizer is able to get approx half the native code execution speed compared to handwritten optimized sse2/3 NumPy routines.  Note that sse4 and sse2/3 have the same vector register size, so the maximum speed gain is equivalent in all of them.  EDIT: NumPy on top of CPython uses OpenBlas + AVX(2), so that is incomparable. I will do more evaluation on the topic soon.  Having that said, this only compares native (a head of time) compiled code with jitted code. Programs do not normally consist only of statements using NumPy.  Thus the situation improved.  I'm currently looking into these issues and see what can be done."

[More Info]  What I am talking about is forgoing creating your app object in the global namespace of your app/__init__.py module in favor of something like this.  What you get from this is the ability to create your app in a way relevant to the context you are working in. In my case, I can swap out the config type for my tests (so that I can drop and recreate tables without nuking my dev or production databases).

Python,3bo019,o11c,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:21:52 2015 UTC,"The only reason I have not switched over to Python 3 is because of the way it handles broken text encodings. Most of what I do is data extraction, when python 3 first came out I was really excited. Then when I attempted to actually use it for data extraction it just repeatedly threw errors. It was so frustrating.  Is there a practical tutorial on how to use surrogateescape for sockets, streams etc ? Practical as in here is a web resource full of broken encodings, this is what I do to extract the data out of it.  If I sound kind of frustrated/fearful I am 😃 I am worried that with python 3 there might be a website which I can't extract the data. Most of my clients pay me depending on how fast I return the results. So in some cases if I do not return results in less then 24 hours I do not get paid.   The big problem is there might be a bad encoding on just a few of the webpages. I have this fear with python 3 my scraper might crash after I have extracted half of a website."

If you're more concerned about not losing data, but willing to give up some control over exactly what is going on, there are packages that will do some guesswork about encodings:   chardet looks at binary data and tries to guess what encoding it is in. ftfy goes one step further - it takes text that may already have been corrupted by using incorrect encodings, and tries to fix it back to what was meant. It also does a bunch of other cleaning, though you can turn off operations you don't want."

Python,3brug5,Whougonnacall503,3,Wed Jul 1 17:16:03 2015 UTC,Python doesn't do function overloading like other languages do. Do as /u/anossov said and use default arguments.
Python,3brug5,Kopachris,3,Wed Jul 1 17:31:04 2015 UTC,"In addition to the other answer, Python also has keyword arguments.  def func (opt, **kwargs):     print(kwargs)     # kwargs is a regular dictionary so     #    'if a in kwargs:'      # or     #    a = kwargs.get(a, None)     # are both OK  func (12, a=1, b=2)"
Python,3brug5,anossov,2,Wed Jul 1 17:34:29 2015 UTC,"Do missing fields have default values? If so, default arguments make the most sense:  def__init__(field1, field2=None, field3=None):     self.field1 = field1     self.field2 = field2   # will be set to None if not passed      self.field3 = field3   # will be set to None if not passed"
Python,3brug5,bheklilr,0,Wed Jul 1 17:26:15 2015 UTC,"A common implementation (i.e. one used in the standard library) is to use staticmethods for multiple constructors (which admittedly isn't quite the same as overloaded constructors):  class MyClass(object):     # The default constructor     def __init__(self, field1, field2, field3):         self.field1 = field1         self.field2 = field2         self.field3 = field3      @staticmethod     def only_field1(field1):         return MyClass(field1, None, None)      @staticmethod     def missing_field3(field1, field2):         return MyClass(field1, field2, None)   Then you would just have  example1 = MyClass('field1', 'field2', 'field3') example2 = MyClass.missing_field3('field1', 'field2') example3 = MyClass.only_field1('field1')   You can see this in particular with the datetime.datetime class, since it has a default constructor taking a time representation, but there's also datetime.now and datetime.today where both have unique behavior.  In your case, since you just have 1, 2 or 3 fields you can get away with just using keyword arguments with default values:  class MyClass(object):     def __init__(self, field1, field2=None, field3=None):         self.field1 = field1         self.field2 = field2         self.field3 = field3"

Python,3bnlvb,michaelkepler,2,Wed Jul 1 13:41:21 2015 UTC,"Well to each his own.  PDFs are still standard for a reason, and obviously if your client wants that then that's what you give her.  I usually stick with a pdf for non-tech people too."
Python,3bnlvb,crmullins,2,Wed Jul 1 13:51:19 2015 UTC,"pdfs are the devil. its one of the most hideously complex data formats out there and is truly difficult to to work with. simpler file formats (html, xml, json, csv, etc.) can be dynamically generated with ease and there are numerous high quality open source python tools for doing that.  not the case with PDF. its truly challenging to do anything with because of the complexity of the format and the very limited set of tools available to work with. most of the actually good tools for doing work with PDF are proprietary and very expensive."
Python,3bnlvb,metaphorm,2,Wed Jul 1 12:37:43 2015 UTC,"html, xml, json, csv   Can you tell me how can I make a business report in XML, JSON, or CSV? My client is not interested in raw data, so I need to include some graphs and paragraphs of text.   I suppose I could use HTML and put it on my website. Problem is, my client wants to keep the report internal as it has sensitive data. I could restrict the access by keeping the link hidden - but that's security by obscurity and it doesn't work. A better solutions would be to keep the report behind login, but now they have to remember login/password and use it every time they want to access the report. Besides, my client wants to access it offline and share it within their company, for example as an email attachment or through their intranet. And they want something that can be easily printed while keeping the layout intact.  They can of course download HTML (and CSS and all other files) and view it offline, but it's a problem to distribute many files. They could zip them, but that's not user-friendly.  PDFs on the other hand are easy to share (it's just one file), their layout is consistent on different devices (this can't be said about Word documents or Power Point presentations), can display different types of data, and can be easily printed.  It's not a coincidence that executives like PDFs.   most of the actually good tools for doing work with PDF are proprietary and very expensive.   Computers and employees are also very expensive - even more so than licenses of proprietary PDF software. If you work with clients, you charge them appropriately so your operating costs are covered."
Python,3bnlvb,michaelkepler,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:26:00 2015 UTC,"HTML is suitable for business reports, but for reasons I'm sure you're aware of, is harder to print on paper than PDF (which was, after all, designed as a printable format to begin with).   At my own company we produce business reports for our clients (real estate industry, a lot of financial stuff involved) by using the webkit render engine to port HTML to pdf and then send the pdf as an attached file for download or email. Its not a perfect system, but it gives us much more flexibility in report design and layout, and much easier development of new report designs. The price we pay is that page breaks over tables sometimes comes out a little awkward. I think its a worthwhile trade off though.  so the problem is with development and tooling. we do use pdfs and we need to. I'm not sure why you seemed to believe I was suggesting otherwise. but its miserable to work with pdfs because the technology to do so is pretty lacking."

But for HTML -> PDF I find the technology sufficient for my clients' needs. If they want something flawlessly polished (haven't happened yet) then I can get a designer to make the report in InDesign by hand. It would cost more, of course.  I played with LaTeX -> PDF conversion and generating InDesign files from XML. But it's easier to hire people familiar with CSS/HTML than the ones who know LaTeX or InDesign scripting. Plus, InDesign templating is not that flexible.  By the way, my workaround is to automatically split HTML tables based on the number of rows."

Dynamically generating a PDF directly is lacking and miserable (and slow as shit even when it does work). The best I've come up with yet in python is the foss library for reportlab, which is a very watered down version of an extremely expensive enterprise oriented product. we would be willing to pay for the product, but, we can't. their license explicitly prohibits embedding their non-foss product in another commercial product.   the others options we've explored (not in Python) are all really similar, most of them are basically desktop apps with a GUI PDF editor intended to be installed on a Windows machine at the desk of a business analyst. very little of this is designed as server-side software. and all of it is extremely expensive.  extracting data from PDF is another major major use case in our business. we get a huge amount of primary source data (real estate listings for rentals and sales mostly) delivered as PDF attachments to emails. we've experimented with many different ways to try and digest these and get the useful data out, but nothing works well. the best so far has been pdfminer, which mostly works for the specific subset of PDFs that are mostly text and formatted in sane ways. that is a tiny minority of what we get though. we have human data entry specialists do this work for us because the software tools for PDF data extraction are poor. they are poor because the PDF format itself is the devil. it is simply not designed to support this use case at all, and trying to force that square peg into our round hole here is not efficient or effective."

Returning NotImplemented lets Python:   try the reverse implementation, if a.__eq__(b) is not implemented it can try b.__eq__(a) in case type(b) implements it but type(a) does not (that happens regularly for subclasses for instance, or e.g. mappings) fallback on an identity check and return a value which makes sense   As an example, consider  from __future__ import print_function  class A(object):     def __eq__(self, other):         if isinstance(other, type(self)):             return True         return NotImplemented  class B(object):     pass  class C(object):     def __eq__(self, other):         if isinstance(other, (A, C)):             return True         return NotImplemented  print(""A = B?"", A() == B()) print(""B = C?"", B() == C()) print(""A = C?"", A() == C())   This will print False, False and True."

Otherwise you should return NotImplemented instead to indicate that this method does not implement comparisons between type(self) and type(other)
Python,3bqfof,masklinn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:57:48 2015 UTC,As to it being a bad practice I obviously agree.  But isn't incomparable/inherently different types are by definition not equal to each other and thus returning False is the right thing to do?

The main problem is that they are focused around Python, neglecting non-Python library dependencies, such as HDF5, MKL, LLVM, etc., which do not have a setup.py in their source code and also do not install files into Python’s site-packages directory.  Under the hood, we have created a concept of environments which are conceptually similar to virtualenvs, but which use filesystem-level hard links to create entirely self-contained Python runtime layouts. By using the ‘conda’ command line tool, users can easily switch between environments, create environments, and install different versions of libraries and modules into them.

Lots of third (?) party Python libraries that use  Qt rely specifically on PyQt4, which is a problem for forwards compatibility. PyQt4/5 is not as straightforward to install since you can't use pip (yeah, you can use conda, but that's less standard).  I really want to like Qt under Python.

Python,3blwko,KalebTheKraken,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:47:50 2015 UTC,"has qt lost weight since then?   On most platforms it isn't modular. And you won't get very far without pulling in most of the toolkit. Just some space numbers:  qt5-base: 52MB qt5-declarative: 16MB qt5-webengine: 92MB (its basically Chromium though)  Heres the trick. Pretty much every computer is already running some Qt software, so I cannot be bothered about how the toolkit is some ~200MB big when its already installed most places, albeit all the Windows Qt programs are bundling the toolkit with their installers individually, but thats Microsofts fault for not having any package management on the piece of junk.  My reasoning is everyone should be using Qt for pretty much everything, so the space usage doesn't matter. Its not bloat, its ""comprehensive"". All the heavy weighted things (multimedia, their JS engine, webengine) are all super important to have.  At that, compile times of big C++ codebases are still awful. If you use only QML / JS / Python though you don't have to compile anything, albeit for deployment you almost certainly want a wrapper binary instead of using qmlviewer."

These days, I could probably recycle my old code and put a Qt interface on it that looks better and works cross-platform with about as much effort as using PyGTK+Glade. QtCreator with pyuic to convert the .ui files (to offer a backbone/template interface) to .py with PyQt code generated.

Python,3bntj3,btreecat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:37:55 2015 UTC,"Primarily I intended it for quickly building HATEOAS web API's.  For example, if I had an API that exposed users and posts, it could provided full urls connecting the user to each of their posts.  With other REST frameworks, hitting the endpoint will just return a basic JSON object that partially implements REST (i.e. The api is not self-describing).  In ripozo, you can easily return protocols like SIREN or Hal where other frameworks would suffer.  This means that the client doesn't have to know how to construct urls or, with some protocols such as SIREN, it can discover what actions are available on a resource simply by making a request to the an initial endpoint.  Additionally, I wasn't a huge fan of the REST frameworks for flask.  I love django-rest-framework, but unfortunately that's Django specific (we use Flask at work).  I wanted something that gave me the ease and flexibility of DRF while not being tied to either Django or its ORM (although ripozo does have a Django integration)."

A basic JSON object that doesn't explain anything about the resource itself outside of its attributes.    A SIREN response on the other hand would return this.  It not only gives all of the properties (in the properties attribute) but also actions and fully resolved links to the tasks that are a part of the board.  Alternatively, ripozo could return a HAL formatted response which is in between the two other responses.  These are actually all available simply by changing your Accept header."

Python,3bo6k0,franchyze922,2,Tue Jun 30 20:06:01 2015 UTC,"Python is great language to use for a back end!  What you're looking for is a web framework.  Python has a few different frameworks.  The popular ones are Django, Flask, Tornado, and Pyramid.  (Node.js is just an interpreter and package manager for javascript.  There are also many frameworks for Node.js)  Django is very robust and is structured in a way that it makes setting up multiple apps for the same site easy (for example, if you needed to handle emails, serve an API, handle payments, etc.).  Flask is described as a microframework.  It's very simple to get started and use with a few routes.  It's my go to for small projects and might be right for your needs.  I'm not as familiar with Tornado and Pyramid but I have read plenty of good things.  It seems like your site is going to require a couple things.   A front end that displays a map, adds markers whenever new tweets are received, display tweets when they are received. (Displaying a map and new tweets should be pretty simple.  Adding markers in the right spot might take some work) A back end worker that is listening for new tweets (it seems like you already have this worked out). A way to tell the front end about new tweets.   There are a few options for number 3.   The first is called polling.  Your front end would ask your back end every X amount of time if there are any new tweets.  This is a standard practice, but sort of negates your streaming of tweets since you won't get any new tweets until your front end asks for them.  The second is called web sockets (the most popular resource being SocketIO).  Web sockets allow your server to keep a constant connection to the front end (normally once the client has finished downloading all of the resources from the server, it will end its connection).  Sockets will allow you to emit messages from your server to any clients that have an open connection with the back end.  Web development is the easiest subject to jump right into, but it seems like this is a good size project for it.  Good luck!"

So if you want to freeze your program for Windows, freeze it on Windows; if you want to run it on Macs, freeze it on a Mac.""  edit: I understand what you meant now, 'they require you to be on a Mac IF you want to build for Mac, likewise for Linux, Windows, etc'  There's also pyinstaller and py2exe  https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki  http://www.py2exe.org/  I'm not sure of a solution for Cross-Compiling. Part of the problem is that you're wanting to bundle your App for many operating systems, each of which will need OS specific files bundled with your app. If you don't have these files on your local computer then there's no way to bundle them into your app.   These programs which do the bundling don't come with the files pre-installed due to copyright restrictions - ie. cx_Freeze isn't bundled with Windows specific .dll's which come from Microsoft, however the program knows where to look for them if they exist locally.  You're best bet may be to try and get access to a local machine for each OS you want to build for.  If there's an easier way to do this - I'd love to find out about it as well"

Python,3bgjud,3825,7,Mon Jun 29 02:39:20 2015 UTC,"You can still leak memory in a GCed language like Python or Java. If you're sloppy, you can write code where objects never go out of scope even though they're no longer needed. If you do this every time some particular event happens, your app will keep eating memory until it crashes. For example, suppose your server application opens a thread for each new connection it receives in order to manage the socket, but connections are never timed out. Then whenever a client drops off abruptly without closing the conn, you leak a thread and all the memory scoped in that thread."

Python,3bgjud,whiteandnerdy1729,3,Mon Jun 29 04:43:50 2015 UTC,That is what I meant. C++ doesn't have garbage collection and you have to be careful to delete allocated memory or you wind up with memory leaks.  Or use smart pointers and such. And it's a pain. Python does this for you.

(In the case of circular references, if that isn't what you want, you should be using weakrefs.)

Python,3bgjud,duckythescientist,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:54:05 2015 UTC,"Memory (RAM) is like table space. It's a place for you to put things you're working on or need access to quickly while working on something - when you're done, you're supposed to shred (delete) it or store it in a filing cabinet or book shelf  (hard drive). [1]  Processes are like several people all using the table space simultaneously.[2] Somebody (the operating system) governs who can use what space on the tables each person can use in real time.   Usually, you as a process ask for table space, and put stuff down on it as you're working. Let's say you put down some research books for a paper you're writing. Now you realise that one of the books is totally irrelevant, so you take it off the table, put it back on the shelf, and take our another book.   What you just did is reused space you already had assigned to you, but no longer needed for that first book, to put down another book.   You realise you can take on another angle for your paper, so you ask for more space. The governor gives you another table three tables away (because other people were assigned space near you meanwhile). You put down some other books.   Suppose you realise that angle gets you nowhere. So you put away all the books, go to the governor and tell him you don't need the table anymore. He marks it as available, and assigns it to someone else who needs space later. You're being a good user of this table space by only using what you need and letting others use space when you're done with it.   What if you just left the books there? Even though you will never use those books again and even removed any reference to them in your notes entirely? Nobody else can use that space, and nobody knows whether you might legitimately be using it or need it later (maybe you keep some swap space when you very quickly need to throw things in there once in a while).   But you keep doing this - everything you find a big new angle, you get more table space, and then when you realise it's crap, you just leave everything there and forget about it.   Now nobody else can use that space, and the governor is running out of space to give people.   And that's a memory leak.   In programs, the programmer forgetting to release memory that was previously assigned before just forgetting about it (not having any variables or pointers pointing to that memory) causes memory leaks. Various programming methodologies try to reduce the likelihood of this happening by ensuring that the places where memory allocation and freeing are more obvious or more  structured (RAII for instance), or by adding extra code to every pointer to check whether the memory is still held by some pointer/variable (many can map to one piece of memory). Of course, the latter can ""leak"" if memory is pointed to but never used again by the application.   [1] With a filing cabinet and table, you move a copy of your document around. With computers, you make a copy - the data on the hard drive is copied to memory but still exists on the drive. Saving from memory to drive implies overwriting (erasing the old copy and storing the new one).   [2] This analogy only works with memory. If you introduce the idea of a processor, it breaks down (many people can think different things simultaneously, but a computer only has one or a few processors to do calculations but can have many processes going on at once)."

Be sure to let them see the emotional attachment you have to programming as well as the intellectual coolness.    The technical thing which I've found is pretty cool to show off is just opening up ipython and fooling around with some of the cool built-in functionality.  I usually start by just showing how it can be used as a calculator to get some basis down for a common ground.  Then I show how it can calculate lots of things really fast with some list comprehensions.  Then I show the power of abstraction by importing the datetime library and calculating various things with it.  I ask for their birthdays and calculate the amount of time they've been alive in days.  Somewhere along the way I work in variables.  You can do other interesting things as well like ""when would somebody have to be born to be twice as old as me?""  The whole time I'm talking about what's cool about each of these things I'm doing, and emphasizing the practical power of computers to make things easier.  I focus a lot on the concept of being able to program something once and have a computer do it a lot of times really fast, or for it to be reused.  Sometimes I also show them things I'm working on and describe how people are using them and point out how that relates to the concepts I just mentioned (I'm an analytics engineer so data processing is a natural application of ""doing lots of things really fast"" and I can show them dashboards which process millions of calculations per second)."

The PRNG is having a go at it: super-duper hard maths, again. Printing to the console involves more maths: serializing, escaping characters, font rendering, hardware blitting. Pixels in the monitor involve applied electronics, which is maths again, photons are emitted, etc…  It's all maths, yet no one in their right mind would say that cat is maths.

Python,3bgjud,kosmoi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:39:43 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, learning fancy new languages is not 100% about programming: it mostly has to do with language. Learning a new language is usually fun, but people who enjoy programming often enjoy a type of language with very formal grammar, unlike most spoken/written languages.  Language, as an abstract, is a means of expressing or conveying ideas. Programming fits the definition very nicely.  Some languages such as Haskell have very short, formal grammar. Once you learn function definition, operator infixing and pattern matching, there's not much more you need to know to be able to ""parse"" Haskell. Learning how to express complex ideas with Haskell might be harder at first, since it requires knowledge of constructs and predefined functions/monads, to avoid re-inventing the wheel. Likewise, some languages, while very formal, have very extensive grammar. SQL is an example: you may be an SQL pro and use it daily, but still you may stumble upon syntax you have never seen before. Yet, SQL is still arguably fun to learn.  No programmer enjoys unexpected behaviour when learning a new (programming) language; it's the same when learning a traditional language, e.g. in French, 'table', 'apple' and 'car' are feminine words,  you are just ""supposed"" to know that. Many people hate learning shell scripting due to things they do not expect, like escaping spaces in parameters."

Python,3bgjud,perfecthashbrowns,3,Mon Jun 29 08:41:00 2015 UTC,"I had a friend that was doing his Ph.D in Mathematics. Towards the end (like the last 2/3s - ish) he was very frustrated because whatever he was trying to demonstrate was proving elusive. At the cajoling of his advisor he continued down what he considered to be a fruitless path. Finally he learned that the concept would never be demonstrable and that he could prove it(and was awarded his Ph.D as a result)   What is the lesson here? We tend to obsess about things in terms of their objective successes and failures. In the above example the protagonist failed to prove what they set out to prove, but it wasn't a loss. In fact, it was a success because some previously unknown truth was revealed. I think one thing that causes people to get frustrated with programming is that somethings prevents them from taking a step back and acknowledging that every step (regardless of whether its a situational success or failure) is a step forward. They just need to take the time to understand it, catalogue it, and recollect themselves for the next step.  Imagine a person trying to iterate over a Set in java and being confused by the seemingly random order of the values. There are at least two types of individuals. Upon learning the answer the first throws their hands up, complains, says ""So stupid who would ever want things to work that way?"" and walks away. The other delights in finding out the answer and proceeds to read about Set, the CS principles related to Set, and maybe even some light set theory. This person then incorporates this concept into their ever growing toolbag.  The second response is almost certainly the desirable sort. How do you cultivate that attitude is tricky. Its probably person to person and it may be not be possible at all. With that being said it never hurts to come from a place of profound empathy and encouragement. On approach might be to start with finding the sorts of things that interest that person and turn them into programming tasks(spreadsheets, web programming, etc.). Most of these offer easy ways to get your feet wet with programming(You can have a Flask web server in like 5 lines or something.) Then just be encouraging and helpful, but ultimately whether the individual sticks with it is going to be their decision."

Using GvR, a student writes a program that controls a 'robot' that moves through a city consisting of a rectangular grid of streets (left-right) and avenues (up-down). Guido van Robot uses a minimalistic programming language providing just enough syntax to help students learn the concepts of sequencing, conditional branching, looping and procedural abstraction.

From my own experience, less than 10% of my (paying) students are girls. However, i observed when teaching in equally mixed (boys and girls) classes in public schools:  I noticed no difference (between boys and girls) in intellectual capacity to understand concepts of programming or in capability to create little programs (like with http://scratch.mit.edu ).  I noticeded a difference in genuine interest in creating computer programs (games / apps), those who express strong interest (before a lesson) and those asking for another lesson afterwards are mostly boys.  I noticed a difference in ""Experimentierfreude"" (=joy of experimenting?). Those who find unexpected solutions, enjoy ""trying out"" things without being asked to do so, or discover unknown features are mostly boys. Also correlates with ability to self-help by ""trying out things"" when stuck: nearly always boys, but only some of them.  I noticed a difference in discipline (endurance, accuracy). Those willing to finish a complex task as asked by the teacher were mostly girls. Often, those were the same girls sitting idle when the task was completed, without any drive to experiment on their own terms.   I feel that in my region and culture (Vienna, central Europe) not every child find programming interested. Those that find it interesting are mostly boys, but the big majority in both genders is simply indifferent toward the topic. I guess that teaching the same (computer science) topics in different classes (girls only / boys only) would result in the girls class as a whole advance faster and have better score at the end, while the boys only class would have lower average score as a whole but bigger group of high-interested students loving the subject and choosing it for further studies.  My experience is that it is easier to ""sell"" that programming is meaningful to girls if the girls can see an end result (archived by programming) that make sense to them. I had satisfying interest from girls in a workshop with a programmable stitching machine ( see http://www.stitchcode.com/drawtool/ or http://www.turtlestitch.org/ ).  For many boys, the idea alone to tinker with computer games / apps is motivation enough.   Speculation: I did noticed that both groups with lowest interest in programming were always  a) some girls (i could not detect/understand the social status).   b) ""difficult"" boys (bully).  The girls worked best in groups of close friends together at a single computer, but never alone.  The boys needed constant help from a teacher (or, preferred, from an enslaved nerd).  I suppose that success at computer programming (self learn) correlates negative with social (or muscle) skills."

The bottleneck is that these 2 Gb + files are too large for ImageJ to load in their entirety, since it's not as robust as something like traditional video editing software.  It is, however, free and easy to use.  If I can reduce the dimensions of the video from 700+ frames x 1024 pixels x 1024 pixels to something more reasonable (say, 100x500 pixels), ImageJ can load it and I can be consistent with the work I've done up to this point with smaller files.

I was also adding the folder to the zip and looks like it didn't liked the folders being compressed with ZIP_DEFLATED. What I did was to manually set the compression to ZIP_STORED for folders and to ZIP_DEFLATED for files and after this it worked. Interesting how Java knew to do this automatically behind the scenes, or at least I guess it does as the Java version is kind of the same (iterate over folders/files and add them to the ZIP) except I just use the default values (so I never explicitly set the compression type for anything).  So basically my code (the version that didn't worked) was something like this:  for dir_path, dir_names, file_names in os.walk(absolute_folder_path, compression=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED):     ...     # Add folder to ZIP     f_zip.write(absolute_dir_path, arcname=relative_dir_path)      for file_name in file_names:         ...         # Add file to ZIP         f_zip.write(absolute_file_path, arcname=relative_file_path)   and the fix was this one:  for dir_path, dir_names, file_names in os.walk(absolute_folder_path):     ...     # Add folder to ZIP     f_zip.write(absolute_dir_path, arcname=relative_dir_path, compress_type=zipfile.ZIP_STORED)      for file_name in file_names:         ...         # Add file to ZIP         f_zip.write(absolute_file_path, arcname=relative_file_path, compress_type=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)"

The important thing to understand is that at the moment Python comes in two flavours, 2.7 and 3.2. People are slowly moving over to 3.2, but most things are still in 2.7.  To run Python on your own computer you will need the interpreter from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Depending on which version you choose to start with (I'd suggest 2.7) you'll need the correct installer.  Learn Python the Hard way is a good online introduction to Python 2.7 http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html  When you're happy with the basic syntax I'd also recommend having a go at the Python Challenge (http://www.pythonchallenge.com/), which can be quite a fun way to exercise your new Python muscles (although be warned that some of their suggested solutions can use slightly older and outdated modules.

Python,3bj5dh,programmyr,5,Mon Jun 29 18:40:20 2015 UTC,"There are always going to be cases where a lower-level language can do something particularly elegantly, which is hard to replicate in a higher-level language.  Take Mel's machine language code:   Since Mel knew the numerical value of every operation code, and assigned his own drum addresses, every instruction he wrote could also be considered a numerical constant. He could pick up an earlier “add” instruction, say, and multiply by it, if it had the right numeric value.   That doesn't necessarily mean that the lower-level language provides a better abstraction.  It usually just means you've happened to luck into something that the lower-level language does well.  Unless your HLL is a strict superset of your LLL (which has its own problems), you can never escape this completely.  In this case, it's convenient that C separates out ""init"", ""step"", and ""test"", but having these three be completely generic and separate isn't actually used very often.  Even C programmers get used to typing for (int i=0; i<N; i++) (and the basic linked-list case, and maybe one other) about 95% of the time.  A much more useful breakdown of this functionality, IMHO, is provided by the abstractions in Python's itertools module:  takewhile(lambda i: i<=N, (2**i for i in count(start=1)))   For example, you could put this in a generator expression, and easily re-use it (only needing to supply the upper limit).  You could write a unit test for it.  You could verify at a glance that it's not going to corrupt memory, or overflow, or even interfere with other variable names.  And all the while, maintaining its O(1) storage requirements.  How would you do that in C?  I can think of a couple ways, but none nearly as simple or elegant as this."

Assuming you have the right libraries, Python does a much better job of conveying intent:  for i in 2**[1,2,3,4]:   Makes it very clear that you are operating on a list of powers of two, whereas  for (i = 1; i<=N; i*=2)   Is pretty opaque at first glance.  It also has different implications depending on whether N is a power of two or not, especially in a nested loop.  To make it even more confusing, there is no way to identify whether N is a power of two or not without searching through the rest of the code."

An IDE like Spyder that integrates with an IPython Console is far superior for prototyping compared to IPy Notebook. Additionally, Spyder natively supports code cells like IPy notebook/Matlab, so it makes prototyping really easy.  I will typically flesh stuff out and do all the trial-error stuff in Spyder till I am at a place where I know my code works. At that point, I pull it into IPython notebook and refactor it if needed in the process. Add in titles, documentation and equations, as well as plots so that it becomes a nice self-documenting notebook that would be great to refer back to at a later point in time.

I mainly work with scientific computing as a scientist as well. I still find Spyder better than working in Ipy notebook because you have direct access to the IPython console. It's very easy to play around in the console and try out a bunch of different commands and refine things till they are doing what you want them to do (for example figuring out the right sequence of Pandas transformations to mung your data). You can of course do the same in the Notebook by constantly re-running the cell, but it's a lot faster just working directly in the console while also having instant, HTML formatted access to documentation on functions/methods with a Ctrl+I combo.

This is the whole idea behind lots of tests, but it's also good to do while writing the code itself.  The last thing you want to do, though, is to wait until the whole product is complete to find out that your code is broken.   So, prototyping is basically making something that works as fast as possible.  ""Get it working first, optimize later""."

Then the magic begins: I very quickly delete all the useless code I no longer need till I have it down to the bare code needed to get the task to work.   Then I annotate the various cells, put equations, even figures, that explain everything.   In the end I have a report. At times I'll need to rerun the analysis with new data. If I set up my notebook well, I'll simply point to the new data and execute all cells, and get all the updated plots, tables, etc. I'm basically coding and creating a report at the same time."

Python,3be5z2,frstwrldprblm,2,Sun Jun 28 18:28:20 2015 UTC,"I started with the console and used it for a long time. My original impression was that the notebook was sort of ""baby stuff,"" mainly for scientists and not so much programmers (if you're a programmer, who needs rich content?). But once I started hacking on the notebook and playing around with it, I was totally hooked and it has basically become another full-fledged IDE for me.  It's most comparable to Emacs+SLIME for lisp. You'll often find lisp programmers saying the ipython notebook is an inferior SLIME, but of course the point they miss is that it's for python and no really good SLIME for python exists.  For larger projects I use the notebook as a normal editor with the %%file magic. Normally I write a file with it, then Ctrl+Home to jump to the top left corner, then Ctrl+/ to comment out the %%file magic and Ctrl+Enter to run the file in the current kernel. So basically I've loaded the file, but I can at the same time break it up into sections and work on parts of it with Ctrl+Shift+-. Then once everything is in place, Shift+m will merge the cells together again. Then uncomment the %%file and save it. This sounds maybe a little tedious but keep in mind you can do it with many files.  So say one class belongs in a different file. Instead of cutting it and pasting it, I'd split the cells, then rearrange them. Not much difference, perhaps, but if you don't know what to do with that class, you can also just keep it by itself in the notebook.   Another example is that I can load and do ""live"" editing of an entire flask project. I once needed to ""touch"" the wsgi file in order to signal to the server that things had changed, so I wrote a wrapper for %%file that would do this.  So just like Emacs+SLIME, once you get to know the shortcuts, and start using few macros and magics you can really do just about anything, and quickly.  Something I'm experimenting with more now is macros for code generation and refactoring. This started with a small macro to generate a full SELECT query for a large table (instead of doing select * ..., then finding you want select * ... except for one field). As an example, for 2to3 code refactoring/translation I wrote a small extension called ipyfuturize."

A raised exception is a special case of return that will keep going up your stack until something handles it. In this case the try/except clause will do the handling for you.   if you change return ValueError to raise ValueError your code should work as intended. I think of raising an exception in terms of ""activating"" it. You're stopping execution and making the code that called the function deal with the error, if it can't it sends it up the stack to be dealt with, hence ""raise""  About the only time you would want to return an exception would be as a factory function to build exceptions that are going to be raised elsewhere."

Python,3be718,alexcasalboni,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:33:14 2015 UTC,"Here are some of the comments on ""What's your least favorite thing about Django?"" that stuck out to me (food for discussion ):  1.  | Sometimes i get questions when trying to deploy to prod due to folder structure (WSGI not getting found). I would like to have an option to scaffold a project that could really support DEV, UAT and PROD environments in an easy way (I've used the Two Scoops of Django book). When moving enviroments we gotta deal with a wsgi.py update and that doesn't seem right. We should be able to set the current ENV using the settings file.  2.  | I am having problems building important things like restful API, RBAC and hierarchies (nested categories) - these are not supported out of the box and I do not understand why I have to do research for external apps, this feels like PHP, searching for the best library or building things yourself in the end - why a framework then at all? Having to fiddle with external apps to get a halfway complete login and user management workflow with object permissions is very bad. These are things that should definitely come oob with a modern web framework. I use open source mainly because of security aspects, but with django still I have to build the most security sensitive part of an app myself with only little guidance, there are some building blocks, but I want to build on community wisdom in security related things, and django does not help me here very much. This somehow defeats the whole idea of using open source because of best security practices. Also building a hierarchical model based app with fine grained group and object permissions is too complicated and dangerous with django. Many web apps need these features, and I find myself going through an trial and error process with dozens of apps-from-somewhere-on-the-internetz, that do not follow the django release cycle and leave me with a patchwork - this should come from the django core team and there should exist official app templates and best practices for these things. Also I would prefer to not to dig into external apps like DRF just to provide a restful api from my dango app - the models are already defined, so why is this not generated by default by django via an optional route? Another big design problem is the lack of support for dynamic models. Web development is the most dynamic development environment, and it is very likely that at some point you will need dynamic models. There are some apps and talks about this, but I believe that django-mutant and other approaches like django-hstore are no real solutions and only show, how deep this problem sits in the basic design. And again these apps might not follow the release cycle - even more patchwork. Brilliantly executed for one version of django, but developers have problems keeping pace with the django releases. Dynamic models should be solved in the django core. I believe these are the only serious limitations in django, however these can hurt your project very hard if you hit them and come out as very expensive. It hurts especially when you know that even things like drupal and wordpress have tools for all of this, that you can learn to use in a day or so. Thank you very much for your attention!  3.  | Lack of default implementation of some commonly-needed functionality (rule-based object-specific permissions, static asset optimization, etc.)  4.  | Forms. The only nice thing about them is that they integrate with models. If ModelForm was removed, I would immediately switch to something else. Everything besides ORM integration is simply terrible: - Writing custom fields or widgets is one big PITA. - After so many years there is no simple, built-in mechanism to customize form's behavior based on a request. Sure, you can override init, but it's so ugly and annoying. - Customizing form's output could be much easier. Now, if I want to set the same class (I mean the ""class"" attribute in HTML) for every field, I have to either set it for each field separately (which might be quite verbose) or write an ugly for-loop in init, where I already had to put 20 other LOC to override querysets for some fields (see: previous point). To sum up: once I have to customize my forms (and this moment comes very quickly after I start a project), I begin to hate Django, which is NOT OK, because otherwise Django is a wonderful piece of software."

Python,3been9,RDMXGD,0,Sun Jun 28 20:19:25 2015 UTC,Line profiling on your code will not give a good idea of how IO-bound the functions you call are. cProfile or gprof and pay attention to the time spent doing IO during that code.

The two longest running calls I can see are  <method 'acquire' of'_thread.lock' objects> and  <method 'read' of 'pandas.parser.TextReader' objects>  Both account for approx 45% of the total run time."
Python,3been9,ilikebigsandwiches,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:30:31 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize that this was already multithreaded. This makes profile results........difficult to interpret at best. Time between the start and end of a call that was spent in another thread counts to the time of that call. You need to see if things that are waiting, such as file read calls. I don't know what pandas.parser.TextReader does, if there is both IO and CPU stuff going on or if it's a thin IO wrapper.  Looking at waiting on acquiring locks is not the same as other waiting, because presumably you're doing other stuff in the meantime.  If most of the time isn't spent in stuff like read calls, you're not IO-bound. In stuff written in C (core Python and C extensions), cProfile can lose access to calls, making it unclear when you're doing what. A C-level profile can be useful in such situations, sometimes."

For example, you don't have control over the flow control (maybe you're using celery) or you need to trigger an event in a framework (SQLAlchemy events).  But in this case, I would recommend against them because it's using a sledge hammer to hang a picture frame.  Rather, use a basic iterator that just generates Fibonacci numbers, use it to feed some loop and operate on it's results.  for number in fibs:     if something(number):          # interesting stuff here     else:         # Iunno throw an error?

Python,3bak0g,geowalton,18,Sat Jun 27 10:22:35 2015 UTC,"My intention was to make a GUI library where you can make little python scripts have GUIs quite easily. It's not intended for really complex GUI programs, though I've tried to keep the raw TkInter methods exposed as much as I can.  It needs to be rewritten to use grids (the layout using stacks and flows is a bit unpredictable atm, as it simply uses TkInter's ""packing"" methods), and I'll probably just rename stacks and flows to columns and rows when/if it's finished.  But as it stands, I'm just keen to hear what people think;   The main thing that makes it unique is the way it uses context managers (the 'with window:' e.t.c. blocks) to create windows, rows and columns. Where an element appears in the GUI depends on where in these blocks it is defined.   There's also decorators for various elements - e.g. adding @button to a function creates a button which triggers that function when pressed (which I think is GENIUS!), and where the button appears depends on what context manager the function is defined in i.e. it's location within the window, stack and flow blocks.  The text on GUI elements is made much more pythonic, so they can be read and changed by simply doing element.text = ""whatever"" rather than all the messing about you usually have to use with TkInter (you need to create a StringVar and manipulate that). I've also changed a few other elements like radio buttons, where the value of them can be accessed and changed in the same simple way (e.g. radio.number = 5)  By the way, if you're interested in branching out, Ruby is a really cool language and the Shoes library is the easiest to use GUI library I've ever used, which is why I tried to make a Python version of it."
Python,3bak0g,bs4h,5,Sat Jun 27 10:31:32 2015 UTC,"Cons:   Lots of implicit/magic state   Goes against the Zen  Doesn't look like you can create reusable components easily (code is not data) Can't be manipulated after initial definition?   Once the with context goes out of scope, there seems to be no way of accessing and modifying the UI state (e.g. deactivate a button)    Pros:   Nice for quick / throw-away stuff My #1 complaint about Tk is how the parent<->child relationship is inverted in the API (child has a parent, not parent has children). This is kind of fixed here."
Python,3bak0g,VerilyAMonkey,2,Sat Jun 27 15:22:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback, I'll try and address some of the cons;   Once the with context goes out of scope, there seems to be no way of accessing and modifying the UI state (e.g. deactivate a button)   Yes you can, because the classes inheret from the relevant TkInter classes, so you can always fall back on TkInter (which isn't super elegant, but it does work)  For example, try this (for Python 2.7);  from sandals import * from Tkinter import DISABLED  def showMessage():     showInfo(message = ""You clicked the button"")  with window():     with stack():         with flow():             label(""Here's a button:"")             myButton = button(""I'm a button"", command = showMessage)          @button(""Disable button"")         def disableButton():             myButton.config(state = DISABLED)   This will create a window with two buttons, and the second button disables the first, despite being out of scope (the first button is part of a flow - a row - which the second button is not a part of)   Lots of implicit/magic state   There aren't too many magic states (if I'm understanding this correctly). The only real hidden variables are to do with the GUI layout, and the way using stacks and flows lays them out. Using ""with window:"" can always be rewritten as ""with window as w1:"", and then you can access w1, which derives from tkinter.Tk. Similarly the stacks and flows derive from TkInter Frames, and you can access them the same way (e.g. ""with stack as column1:"")"

Then if it is some sort of web app, make a shell script or stub which starts the docker container, you could even make it so it opens a web browser.  One person here was saying docker is hard to network, and it has security problems and it is buggy. The security problems I do not know about. For the networking and buggy I have never had a problem with that. On a VPS I have programically created docker containers up to 60 of them running at once, started an rpyc server on them, connected to them and then shut them down when finished.

Python,3b85ld,CodeKevin,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:29:10 2015 UTC,I mean there is clearly merit to the approach. Atom is gaining traction and the release of Nuclide and Visual Studio Code only reaffirm that the WebView is a valid alternative to writing native code. Unless you want to call Facebook and Microsoft companies wielding hammers to hit nails.
Python,3b85ld,Asdayasman,0,Sun Jun 28 17:34:02 2015 UTC,"Nah, not at all.  Facebook is a web platform in the first place, it makes sense as a business to develop things that tie in.  Microsoft have a vast range of compilers and languages for desktop programming.  Making something web-based is just adding another facet.  What I'm talking about are the developers who will ONLY do web dev, even for stuff that is definitely desktop dev work.  An example is one from work:  We store photographs on a file server in the building.  Photographers come back from jobs, and we copy their photos to this server.  Another set of computers in the building run the digilabs, (big industrial printers), and pull photos from the photo server to send to the labs.  A team we originally got in for web dev, (which didn't go amazingly), were asked if they could rewrite this.  They immediately launched into cloud-based solutions, and span it as ""YOU COULD DO THIS FROM ANYWHERE"" etc., which is absolute fucking bollocks, 'cause that means if the internet goes down, the business stops, which they handwaved.  My solution which addresses their selling point of easy expansion, is data replication.  You open a new office, and plonk a copy of the fileserver there, too.  If the office doesn't have printing facilities, all their fileserver needs to do is hold files.  The fileserver in an office that has printing facilities replicates all of the data on all of the fileservers.  This way, satellite offices can work at LAN speed on their photos, printing offices can work as normal, AND all printing offices have overflow capability to any other printing office.  My solution only falls down when the internet does if it happens when a satellite office wants something printed, which our current solution also falls down on.  We get round it thanks to cars.  Yet another solution this obviously purely web dev team tried to spin was for a photograph database, such that the photographers could attach data (names, addresses, what have you) to photographs while shooting.  All they had was a hammer.  I do believe the suggestion was made that every photographer should carry a laptop and run apache on it.  Much more sensibly, I suggested tablets.  I think phones can do it, too; I've not too much experience with cameras in conjunction with smartphones.  Rant rant rant."
Python,3b85ld,CodeKevin,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:45:50 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you had a problem that wasn't intended for the web but then asked a web dev specific team for a solution.   Yes not every problem needs to be solved by using ""cloud"" infrastructure with an associated web interface. But I think you're missing the point of things like Electron and this blog post. The point isn't to solve the problem with the web, the point is to create a user interface with HTML, JS, and CSS and call into what would normally be server side code directly on the client side.   The server side code is still doing the heavy lifting and really that can be whatever language. Javascript is traditional but it can also be Python as demonstrated here. It just so happens to be Javascript b/c that is what caught on. But there are things like CEFPython and bindings in PyQt to do communication with a webview.   That being said yes not everything needs to or can be done this way, but there are a large amount of applications that do not need to be much more than a webview. Discounting it and saying ""can we not"", is just ignoring a large set of applications and use cases.   It might not have been right for your company but there's a time and a place for webviews."

I don't personally like gevent's approach. I think it's hard to debug and hard to reason about, and you never know whether libraries are going to keep working when they find themselves running asynchronously. I much prefer to write explicit asynchronous code using asyncio.  But I'm happy gevent got ported regardless, because so many people depend on it.

At best this application should be a rudimentary ""hows a stock been doing lately"" program. In addition, when giving out stock advice it is important to consider time, or how long an individuals want to hold positions for. For short term investments looking at a shorter time span and indicators such as moving averages, Bolinger Bands, etc. are great. But for a long term investor, this program does not take into consideration income statements, balance sheets, cash flow, or historical dividend payouts, all of which are things I would personally prioritize over moving averages when looking to purchase a stock. But like I mentioned being able to pull data is a great start, keep working and building it. I haven't used Yahoo Fiance API, but if there are any limitation to what you can pull, you should have a a look at something like Beautiful Soup, to pull data directly from the webpage, Yahoo Finance is loaded with information."

Out of the box it looks like any GUI framework will.  Its blocky and looks old.  However you can customize everything (remember you are in python right?)  If you wan't it to look modern you can either meddle with the class properties or use their QtStyleSheet (which are just *.css files under the covers with a few tweaks). (note I believe they are hanging out in Qt4 not Qt5)  These will primarily inherit your OS's stylings so your application will look slightly different in OSX, Linux, and Windows unless you manually deal with it.  There is also a visual designer for this but honestly avoid it like the plague.  It will generate code that will make your eyes bleed.  Kivy- Kivy is more ""modern"" and tends to look the same on various systems.  Its a little more ""pythonic"" than Qt but still not perfect.  One thing you will see from people is ""why make it a desktop app?""  99.99% of things you want to do can be done with a HTML/Javascript front end.  Even if its not running a remote server you can use your local host and control your application via the browser.  In reality if you want something to look ""really modern"" this is the way to do it.

Qt via either PyQt or Pysides looks leaps and bounds better than Tk in my opinion, has a much steeper learning curve, but gives you far more options for customization. Qt is a C++ framework that's been around for quite some time and has a lot of references and resources to dig into. The python bindings (PyQt4/PySides) are generally pretty great. However Qt can be a pain to install on some OSs. It comes standard in the Anaconda Distribution of python however - so if you're interested that may be one route to go.  Qt has an app called Qt Designer where you can graphically create your Ui and save it as a .ui file or something like that - then there's a command-line method for translating the .ui file into a python file. I have not yet bothered to learn the ins and outs of using Designer in this fashion but in the long run could probably save you some time.  I have never used Kivy but it seems to have a more modern feel to it and seems to be the goto if you have anything 'mobile' in mind like developing for Android or iOS."

Python,3b6h8t,john_philip,3,Fri Jun 26 10:43:29 2015 UTC,"Here are a couple extra tips:   You don't need to actually type the % in front of magics, unless there's a variable with the same name which would shadow it.  (This behavior is controllable with %automagic.) History completion: type the first few chars of a previous command you want to recall, then use up-arrow/down-arrow or Ctrl-P/Ctrl-N to scroll through all the history entries with that prefix.  I find this much easier than having to worry about entry numbers. Tab completion: it obviously works for function names, method names, class names, variable names, etc.  But it also works in amazing other scenarios, for example if you type  f = open('/usr/share/d<TAB>   ...it will complete the diretory/filename.  This also works for magics, e.g. %run fil<TAB> will complete the filename, and likewise for magics like %cd. %doctest_mode toggles the usual >>> prompt which you can use when copying and pasting snippets without having to expose something like In[40] that might not make much sense in isolation. If you have a block of code in the clipboard, use %paste instead of your normal terminal's paste feature.  There are numerous reasons why this is superior.  For one, IPython will take care of indention properly, so you don't have to manually unindent code before pasting it.  Also, you'll see the whole block of code with syntax highlighted, followed by the entire output.  If you try a standard multiline paste you'll have the output of each line interleaved with the source, which is very ugly.  Also, it doesn't spam your history with each line of the paste. IPython automatically ignores the >>>, so you can paste doctests directly without having to edit them. If you haven't already got an IPython config file, run ipython profile create and it will create one (~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py).  This will contain all the config variables along with documentation, so just open it up in an editor and read.  It's a standard Python file.  Everything is commented out, i.e. all the lines contain the default values, so if you want to change something you just edit the line and uncomment it.  I personally like setting c.TerminalInteractiveShell.confirm_exit = False to get rid of the ""are you sure you want to exit?"" confirmation when you press Ctrl-D. Related, you can have multiple profiles.  Run ipython profile create foobar to create a new profile named foobar (with files under ~/.ipython/profile_foobar/*, and then run it with ipython --profile=foobar. Use %reset -f to forget all defined variables if you want to make sure you're staring over. Lots and lots of other magics exist, use %magic to see all of them along with descriptions."

Python,3b6kxz,git-pull,3,Sat Jun 27 12:44:11 2015 UTC,"I created a python package called tmuxp which does all tmuxinator does and more.   It also makes tmux servers, sessions, windows and panes accessible via a python api.  It was great to be able to have all the niceties of tmuxinator with all the greatness of python, and then some.  Some things the tmuxp has tmuxinator doesn't (at least last time I checked):    programmable API to access tmux objects, session ""freezing""[1] YAML / JSON configs (your preference, see example configs) importing teamocil / tmuxinator configs unit tests are against live tmux servers. The internals of the architecture is bit different too. Some of the tmux config manager's are simply command builders, tmuxp has a builder which can react to the current state of the sessions/windows/panes on the tmux server (see tmuxp.workspacebuilder).   [1] Note that the freezing tmuxp employs is sort of naive. It works by saving the dimensions of the layout and checking the current command in the pane, see tmuxp.workspacebuilder.freeze.  Also if you're getting started with tmux, I written a mini-overview of tmux called The Tao of Tmux in the tmuxp docs."

Python,3b2w96,jayfehr,42,Thu Jun 25 15:07:34 2015 UTC,I've got an upcoming lightning talk at our PyDataLondon meetup (for August) to demo Python 3.5+numpy+@ to convince my data science colleagues that it is time to upgrade from 2.7. Stories like this are super-useful evidence that the rest of the world is moving on too.
Python,3b2w96,ianozsvald,12,Thu Jun 25 18:26:29 2015 UTC,The new matrix multiplication operator is enough to convince me.
Python,3b2w96,beaverteeth92,3,Thu Jun 25 18:52:58 2015 UTC,what operator is that?
Python,3b2w96,waspbr,13,Thu Jun 25 22:39:24 2015 UTC,"Prior to 3.5, Numpy provided an np.matrix() class that was a subclass of np.array().  It resulted in different methods and operators for matrix multiplication.  Most classes return arrays, leading to annoying syntax constructs like A.dot(B.dot(C)) to multiply three matrices, while with a matrix class it's A * B * C.  The first is unreadable, and the second is rarely seen and ambiguous because if A, B, and C are np.array's, then the result is elementwise multiplication..  Python 3.5 is adding @ as a matrix multiplication operator.  For both matrices and arrays, you'll be able to do A @ B @ C and get the same result."
Python,3b2w96,beaverteeth92,2,Thu Jun 25 22:44:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is one of those things that would confuse the hell out of me and send me running back to R."
Python,3b2w96,nameBrandon,6,Fri Jun 26 01:50:37 2015 UTC,"So far, annoying matrix multiplication has been the main thing preventing me from using Python.  I love R's package ecosystem, but actually writing code is so much more pleasant in Python.  The new @ operator, if anything, makes Python more like every other scientific computing environment on the planet."
Python,3b2w96,beaverteeth92,5,Fri Jun 26 01:53:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100%. I feel very restricted and clunky in R doing anything outside of pure scientific work. Then when it comes to actual modeling or analysis, it gets reversed.. it's painful for me to try and do it in Python.   Just like the as.factor() function.. took me forever to figure out dummy-encoding in Python."
Python,3b2w96,nameBrandon,2,Fri Jun 26 02:01:24 2015 UTC,Isn't dummy encoding one function in pandas?  And yeah it is annoying especially with categorical variables in scikit-learn.

You should NOT be mocking anything that constitutes part of your code (your System Under Test). You should be mocking external dependencies, which you do not control. In this case 'os.path.join'.  Know your SUT (test only what needs testing). Do not mess with anything inside it (it will couple your tests to your implementation). Divide your code into cohesive units (separation of concerns). Make sure you do not mock when not needed (it is your code, let it run). Mock only the outsides and in order to achieve determinism of tests (looking at you, datetime).

Python,3b6wgx,vladekm,-1,Fri Jun 26 21:55:56 2015 UTC,If you start mocking out your own code then you start coupling your tests to your implementation. Which turns tests into a pointless exercise that limits your refactoring. Never descend below your interface and forget about your functions and classes. Your 'unit' is a cohesive piece of your functionality. Which may or may not be implemented by a class or function.  http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata
Python,3b6wgx,kurashu89,2,Sat Jun 27 08:54:45 2015 UTC,"I disagree, maybe. If by ""Never descend below your interface"" you mean, ""Never descend below your interface when testing collaboration between two objects"" then I agree wholeheartedly. Object A should not care how Object X is implemented and nor should it be mocking anything on it. However, when you're testing the interaction between Object A and Interface X. maybe the best thing to dependency inject is a mock object -- especially since unittest.mock is part of the standard library since 3.3. It's easy to ask questions against.   def test_ObjectA_uses_write_correctly():      ProvidesWriteInterface = mock.Mock()      ProvidesWriteInterface.write.return_value = None      obj_a = ObjectA(destination=ProvidesWriteInterface)      obj_a.save(whatever, you, want, here)       # use Mock.assert_called_once_with if you're using unittest as your runner      # I prefer py.test so I use bare asserts instead      assert ProvidesWriteInterface.write.call_count == 1      assert ProvidesWriteInterface.write.call_args == mock.call(what, it, should, have, gotten)   In this case, I'm not concerned at all with what write does, even though it's possibly a component I wrote myself. Maybe it writes to a database, that takes a long time and I don't want to have to concern myself with the database right now because I can use this object to write to a buffer, S3, a file or stdout (etc, etc). More importantly, if I use the actual object I'm injecting, what happens if the database is down? My test fails, but not for the correct reason.  Rather, I want to know, ""Does this object ask the interface the right question?"" And I think this is what you were getting at (or at least I hope it was). However, in order to ask this question, I need to be aware of the implementation of Object_A.save and that it calls Object_A.destination.save. Does this couple this test to this implementation? Well...yes, but I'm testing the implementation of Object_A.   Now, that said, you can't simply stop here. To paraphrase Joe Rainsberger. ""You need to have a test on the implementations of Interface X that says, Well what if someone does ask this question?"" and, ""Answers from mocks correlate to assertions in the implementation."" Speaking of JBrains, I may as well link his Integrated Tests are a Scam talk since this post is essentially just paraphrasing it.  If we have a mock for WriteableInterface and we call WriteableInterface.write('foo.jpg', BytesIO(...)), we need to have a test against every implementation of WriteableInterface that gets the arguments foo.jpg' and BytesIO(...) and assert that they do the right thing. Maybe we need to dependency inject something or mock out something like builtins.open or whatever.  And to counterpoint, you can't dependency inject everything...well, you can, but at some point it becomes ridiculous to have a bunch of arguments in the __init__ of all your objects with admonishments to users to never ever touch them. For example, I'm writing a library to help handle file uploads. I have validators. One of my validators does an all style comparison of nested validators. I also have a shortcut on the base validator object that overrides __and__ to provide a shortcut. Now, I could dependency inject this and whatever. However, hardcoding this is the easiest thing to do (and if I need to provide an alternatively implementation, subclassing the BaseValidator seems to be a better approach). When it comes time to test if __and__ behaves correctly, I can just patch('BaseValidator.__and__') and assert it does the right thing. In my opinion, dependency injection in this case complicates both the interface and the tests in a bad way (or maybe in a good way because I'm getting feedback that, ""You only have one implementation of this, why are you exposing it at all?"")"
Python,3b6wgx,vladekm,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:07:16 2015 UTC,"Very valid points. Inversion of Control (in your case implemented with dependency injection) is a perfectly valid way of decoupling things. What I meant is that you should never mock something like ObjectA.write_stuff(). You are mocking a 'writer' which is only connected to ObjectA by following a contract necessary for ObjectA to be able to communicate with the outside world.  I believe that unit testing is about testing the I/O into the unit. This is why I am a proponent of the hexagonal architecture where everything that is not strictly 'business logic' is placed outside of the unit. This way your tests concentrate on what is really important while mocking out all the I/O boiler plate. You do end up creating a contract for the unit to see the outside world on both input and output initiated communications but this is a good thing. I would DI everything needed for I/O and never look inside my box.  Is this the best way of doing things? I think everyone should find what suits them. Hexagonal architecture allows you to define very strict interfaces, switchable adapters, easy mocking of non-business logic. Yes, you still must mock stuff you need to assure determinism of your tests (datetime, random numbers, etc.); but this would usually be stuff outside of your code anyway.  I find that having these clear boundaries stops the most common complaint I have heard from developers: ""But I do not know where the boundaries of my SUT are and what to mock out; TDD sucks"".  One more thing - I do not think you should be mocking the interfaces. You should be mocking adapters that implement them. This way you have a stable element that stabilizes two types of tests:   testing inside the interface (Unit Test, logic test) testing outside of the interface - adapters (integration test, communication test)   I hope this makes sense."
Python,3b6wgx,kurashu89,2,Mon Jun 29 18:35:56 2015 UTC,"I think we're on the same page, except for some details. Like:   One more thing - I do not think you should be mocking the interfaces. You should be mocking adapters that implement them.   If I'm just testing if Object_A.write calls the interface with the correct parameters, and I don't need to the behavior of any of the implementations, why not just inject a mock? And if I need the behavior, I'd inject a stub instead. In both cases, I'm not coupled to a production implementation of the interface but rather to a simple piece of code that always does what I need it to.  Which is simpler?  def test_handles_writer_exception():     # ensure we both close the writer and source and propagate the exception     toss_error_writer = mock.Mock()     toss_error_writer.write.side_effect = IOError(""Whoops..."")     source = mock.Mock()      obj_a = Object_A(destination=toss_error_writer, source=source)      with pytest.raises(IOError) as excinfo:         obj_a.save(...)      assert str(excinfo.value) == 'Whoops...'     assert toss_error_writer.close.call_count == 1     assert source.close.call_count == 1   Or:   def test_handles_writer_exception():       from my_lib.writers import SomeWriter       source = mock.Mock()        with patch('my_lib.writers.SomeWriter.write', side_effect=IOError('Whoops...')  as write, \            patch('my_lib.writers.SomeWriter.close') as close:            obj_a = Object_A(destination=SomeWriter, source=source)            with pytest.raises(IOError) as excinfo:                # if you were reviewing this test, would you realize *this* is what we're testing?                obj_a.save(...)       assert str(excinfo.value) == 'Whoops...'     assert close.call_count == 1     assert source.close.call_count == 1   I think providing a mock implementation for testing collaboration is perfectly acceptable, and in my opinion, preferable to mocking an existing implementation. If that implementation disappears, I don't have to touch my tests, except the tests that explicitly deal with that implementation -- which should just deal with it's internal behavior and how it communicates to its dependent interfaces.  In my opinion, that's the whole benefit of using interface in testing. I don't need to use the actual object, just something that looks like the object. And in Python, it's even better because I don't even have to implement the whole interface, just the one method I'm testing against."
Python,3b6wgx,vladekm,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"Yes we are pretty much on the same page.  For me - the interface is only a concept that should be implemented by what I call an adapter (would probably use zope.interfaces for the contract definition). Normally I would pass on to the objectA an instance of an adapter that implements the specific interface. Exactly as you suggest. Except I would never use a mock to create a mock adapter to pass on to my objectA for testing. I would actually write a mock adapter that implements the same interface the real thing does (partially if full thing is not necessary for the specific test). This would give me a double check that my mock and real implementations speak exactly the same language.  Also, the definition of this communication would lay outside of the mocking shenanigans. While in your case you mock out that definition which means that if you change your interface - your tests will not break. Which I think they should.  I am a big fan of test doubles, but I do not like the magic the Mock provides and how many people abuse it."
Python,3b6wgx,kurashu89,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:37:02 2015 UTC,"In the case of the interface changing, there's always mock.create_autospec which will allow you to only make claims against valid members of the class.  from my_lib.interfaces import Writeable MockedWriteable = mock.create_autospec(Writeable)   It's not a perfect imitation of the class (unbound methods and staticmethods are hard, yo), but it's suitable enough for 99% of testing. But it's the best of both worlds: You get the whole interface mocked, but you didn't have to implement it.  You can use this mocked interface for spying, stubbing, whatever. Autospecs are supposed to be lightweight and fast (I've not used them much), so you create one in each test and not worry about having to reset it between them.  But yes, a change in the interface should reflect a change in the tests (or a breakage)."

That basically means if you don't restore the property at the end of the test, it can affect other tests that run after."

Here are a couple examples:  Do you ever have an exception handler that raises an exception? Wouldn't it be nice if you could see the original exception, without having to change the code of the inner exception handler and do traceback surgery? Python 3 shows you both exceptions. It just works.  You probably read string representations of things like lists sometimes. In Python 2, if those string representations contain strings that aren't 7-bit ASCII, they're going to be full of \x and \u bullshit, and you'll have to paste them into a Python prompt just to find out what your log is trying to say. Python 3 knows your computer is grown up and can handle Unicode*, and shows you the real characters as long as they're printable.  * You said you're on Windows, so you might want to make sure this is actually the case.

Next, the division is performed. Then the 'in' operator has next highest precedence.  Finally, the Boolean 'and' operator evaluates everything.   It's not ""left to right"", but based on the binary or unary operator with the strongest binding that is evaluated first.  Good question on ""in"" and ""=="".

Each usergroup has an admin that is also a user. I can't establish the links between account.id and usergroup.admin on the one hand, and between account.id and membership.accountid on the other hand: if a primary key is already being used in a relationship, dragging from that key is interpreted as modifying the existing link.  Not sure what a good solution is, UI-wise -- maybe if the drag starts from the actual red square, then interpret it as modification, but allow establishing the relationship while starting from anywhere on the line defining the primary key?"

In the implementation of HString, structs are passed as values which means there will be additional memcopy operations, while with pointers they will be ""free"". You don't use memcopy and instead you use ""for"" to copy strings from char* to HString. Memcopy would be faster. You could use inline functions and macros instead of normal functions for simple operations like addition, division, etc in the C generated code.

Quickly:  ""+<expr>"" returns the value of <expr>. ""-<expr>"" returns the negation of <expr> (that is, 0-<expr>). ""~<expr>"" returns the bitwise inversion of <expr>, which is functionally equivalent to -(<expr>+1).

In single statements the difference doesn't matter:  x = 5 a = ++x  b = x++ if a=b  then print ""same""  else print ""different""   However,  if you use them in an expression:  X = 5 c = 3 * (x++)  d = 3 * (++x)   You find  that c=15 and d=18 because the postfix operator increments after the multiplication but the prefix operator increment to before.   So,  back to the original statement:  1 +++++ 1  Lets rewrite it: ((1++)++)+1 Since the postfix operators don't increment anything to  until after the expression is evaluated, this comes back as ((1))+1=2."

Python,3azjmx,RonnyPfannschmidt,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:35:15 2015 UTC,sudo pip install is basically always wrong  it installs a non-packagesd package into the area of a distribution thats for distribution-packaged packages  you are supposed to use --user and/or virtualenv

Python,3azaeh,dryadzero,2,Thu Jun 25 00:27:22 2015 UTC,"/r/learnProgramming would be a better place to ask starting questions, but quickly: yes, python is generally considered to be a great language to start on, for various reasons. C++ is much more complicated, leaving you with a bunch more responsibilities as a programmer (memory management, etc.), so if you're looking to get your feet wet, Python's a great place to start. Don't want to discourage you if you feel like you'd like to do some C++, but python's probably where you'll want to start.  As for learning it, you can go through youtube tutorial series, grab a book, or take a class, it's all good. My personal advice is to try to use everything you learn to test yourself to see if you can apply it in actual problem solving. It's really easy to read a book cover-to-cover and not retain any of it if you don't use it."

Python,3ay09u,jpj_shadowbanned,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:49:02 2015 UTC,I made a few edits so that it makes more sense.
Python,3ay09u,jpj_shadowbanned,4,Wed Jun 24 12:56:08 2015 UTC,"Ok, first your classes have no real parent/child relationship in the traditional object oriented meaning. If you want to use the classes the way you have them I suggest you pass the Foo instance to the crazy method. Or you could have a crazy method on Foo that calls the self.list_of_bars[idx].crazy(self) method for you.  Having a relationship defined like this with back references is rarely ever needed and is hard to follow. If you can design it another way or do more obvious things like argument passing it will make the code much cleaner. At least that's how I would do it."
Python,3ay09u,zahlman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:07:17 2015 UTC,"Foo should have a method called add_bar, then the constructor of Bar should have a variable parent which contains a reference to the foo object.

Python,3awb14,takluyver,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:13:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks ;)  Btw, isn't there a way to change the contents of a cell already built into IPython? IIRC you actually once mentioned this on gitter. I'm still using the hack copied below which works well enough but I'd like to change it.  js = """""" var cell = IPython.notebook.get_selected_cell(); var content = {0}; cell.code_mirror.setValue(content); """""".format(js) DisplayMagics().javascript('', js)   An unintended feature of this is that ctrl-shift-enter will send the code into a new cell below, so it's useful for cases where you still want the original (despite the fact that ctrl-z works perfectly well)."
Python,3awb14,takluyver,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:08:40 2015 UTC,"Yep, you can do get_ipython().set_next_input('new code here'). By default it adds a new cell below, but if you do replace=True, it will replace the current cell instead."

Python,3az3hs,tzmudzin,3,Thu Jun 25 01:16:03 2015 UTC,/r/learnpython for future questions please.
Python,3az3hs,elbiot,2,Wed Jun 24 18:22:53 2015 UTC,Did you think about the security implications of allowing arbitrary code to be executed? Eg. The user submitting a program to delete all the files on the server?
Python,3az3hs,tzmudzin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:59:34 2015 UTC,"That's not what they are asking about, but it's a good point."

It's great to see OP think about the possibilities, so I did not want to say ""Stop now!"", but rather make him think a bit further. And I don't mean to be condescending; it's just a mistake a lot of people have made, and it's best to learn from someone else's mistakes."
Python,3az3hs,tzmudzin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:50:48 2015 UTC,"I mean, I didn't hear that OP wanted to be able to upload .py files and then press execute.  They want a website that runs the code they wrote, which is what flask, django, etc do in every situation (they run the code that the developer wrote). I gathered they wanted users to input variables, not code. In the off chance that they were thinking of running exec on a text field or uploaded file though, as I said,  you made a good point."
Python,3az3hs,kteague,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:58:10 2015 UTC,"Ah -- thank you!  I totally misread the requirement then... But in that case you don't need flask or django -- plain old CGI will work best:   Place python in the execution path of the web server Place your script in the /cgi-bin directory, make sure file permissions allow the web server to read+execute Make sure the first line of output is ""Content type: text/plain"" followed by a blank line and anything else the ""simulator"" will display   ... and you're done!  You can see the output under http://yourserver/cgi-bin/script-name.py  Still, thanks for the correction!"
Python,3az3hs,codercoder,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:17:12 2015 UTC,"You can use plain old CGI to call a Python script. Script then calls your app using subprocess.Popen(), parses the results and returns some HTML.  Pretty straightforward. You can use a Python framework if your app is more ambitious and you don't want a bunch of messy HTML embeded in your script, etc. But it depends upon where/how you are hosting the app."

Python,3aum78,jfet,9,Tue Jun 23 17:15:00 2015 UTC,A portfolio is incredibly important. Github is your portfilio.   I'm currently working at a job doing mainly Django and Python and I'm self-taught. I started out as an intern. It is completely possible as long as you have the right engineering mindset and are willing the put in the hours.
Python,3aum78,legrandin,2,Tue Jun 23 17:45:09 2015 UTC,"This is more of a backup plan. I have no idea where to start though. Just learn python, keep writing programs that resemble websites and then upload it on github?  Could you tell me how you started out? How did you get an intern in the first place anyway.  Edit: Do you recommend Django or Flask"
Python,3aum78,legrandin,8,Tue Jun 23 17:57:40 2015 UTC,"I got my internship by going to PyCon and meeting the company president there. Conferences and meetups are a great way to meet potential employers.  If you haven't done all of the Django tutorial (ALL of it!), then I'd start there. After you've done it, start work on some project that is interesting to you. Designing an application like a forum is a good place to start.  You also need to have a basic understanding of version control with Git (to use Github) and an understanding of the fundamental parts of modern programming languages (if you dont already have programming experience). Getting experience working with other developers is essential, but when you're just starting out thats not so easy.  It's important to understand that while Django is incredibly well designed and full of features, you WILL have to get your hands dirty writing pure Python code. Because of this, it's essential to learn the core elements of computer programming if you don't already know them. This should be a focus as much as learning all the internals of Django.  I reccomend http://www.checkio.org/ for programming problems to help you learn.   Hope this helps."
Python,3aum78,legrandin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:26:02 2015 UTC,Say I manage to become an expert at pygame. Do jobs that require Django or Flask open up to me or do I have to learn them too. Programming in one framework isn't enough? And btw do you have a bachelors in computer Science?
Python,3aum78,legrandin,6,Tue Jun 23 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"I have a bachelors in English.  There are lots of issues that you have to grapple with in order to do web development.

Python,3aum78,arbitraryuser,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:30:33 2015 UTC,"For Django, i'd say about six months of on-the-job training.

Python,3aum78,Chaosfalcon,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:08:54 2015 UTC,"My probably really bad advice. Find out what you like doing and do it. I like scraping websites and making scrapers/bots. Now days things are really specialized and I didn't know that people will pay you to scrape websites. I am short of money right now so I made an upwork profile and I managed to get a couple of scraping jobs despite my limited experience on upwork and lack of education. This was based only on my limited github and blog.   Take a look at both Django and Flask, see which appeals to you, I looked at Django a few years back, I didn't like it. I like flask better because it is more low level. Cherrypy I also like. Ultimately it is personal taste. On upwork there are jobs for both flask and django so it probably does not really matter."

In practice this might never work because they're quite happy to receive phone calls, whatever, but the point is that just messing around without a clear product you're trying to build, or problem you're trying to solve, will not challenge you enough to really learn.

As for timeframe, it's hard to say. It was operational within about a month of me putting in a couple of hours here and there in my spare time.  Because I did this project as a labour of love and curiosity, I allowed myself to make mistakes and experiment with different things I wouldn't dare experiment with on a ""real"" project.

Sorting the files will still work and you also get the added benefit of timestamping your pictures. You also don't have to re-initialize the  counter every time you restart the script. Instead of waking up every second to check the time, it's better to calculate the number of seconds until 50 seconds past a minute, and sleep for that duration. If waking up at 50 past the minute isn't really important, you could just do a time.sleep(60) after each image. The way you've done this now, it isn't guaranteed that your script will fetch an image every minute. It may skip at arbitrary moments, considering the following:  Say your script wakes up at 49.999... seconds past the minute, it sees the time.second value to be 49 and goes back to sleep for 1 second. The way your OS scheduler works is based off of a best effort principle. You are not guaranteed a wake-up in exactly one second when you call time.sleep(1), so the next wake up could actually be 1.001 second later, i.e. at second 51. Your script will blissfully move along for another minute without downloading your photo."

Python,3arbwj,amjithr,-13,Tue Jun 23 00:09:48 2015 UTC,"it's less obvious in python, but regular expressions aren't usually considered traditional strings.   In python a regular expression is often denoted with r'<contents>', and is canonically noted as a raw string literal, which allow non-escaped back slashes.

Python,3arbwj,Ashiataka,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:19:42 2015 UTC,If you want to match words with spelling errors the library you need is called fuzzywuzzy.   This library here describes a different use case. Typing 'rodent' will match words like 'rotating_dentures'. Because 'rodent' is a partial substring of rotating_dentures. This is commonly used in file finders where you have a really long path and you want to type bits of pieces of the path that appear along the entire string.

When you say bigger inputs do you mean that it'll be slow if the collection of files is really large or if the user_input is really large?   Do you have tips for optimizing it?"
Python,3arbwj,amjithr,5,Mon Jun 22 23:43:44 2015 UTC,a little bit of both.  you could memoize the collection and prune it so you don't have to search every item after you've eliminated part of the set.
Python,3arbwj,LightShadow,3,Mon Jun 22 23:57:01 2015 UTC,"Yes. That was my biggest concern. But memoizing has to be extra clever to account for users pressing backspace or moving through the input and deleting a char in the middle. So for the first rev I'm not doing memoizing but once I figure out a way to do it reliably, that'll be a nice optimization. :)"
Python,3arbwj,amjithr,3,Tue Jun 23 00:07:38 2015 UTC,Should that really matter though?   The idea would be to maintain an n-length dictionary mapping the last n inputs with corresponding pruned collections.

Which won't match any entry in the dictionary.   Although that is a bit of an unlikely case (or at least a very rare case).   I think you're right, it's doable with a little bit of coding.

In Python 2 the original fuzzyfinder timed at 245 seconds total on my machine, while fuzzyfinder2 timed at  344 seconds.  That was a little surprising.  Apparently the simplicity of the function above cannot overcome the advantage of using wrapped C code.  To test that I wrote another function, fuzzyfinder3.  This is the same as fuzzyfinder2 except that check_item is refactored to use the find method instead of stepping through the string characters one by one.  (It also uses the second, starting-point argument of find to avoid making copies.)  This algorithm times at 151 seconds, which is significantly faster than the original fuzzyfinder using regexes.  Update: The regex module apparently caches enough recent results so that, with so few test cases, it is mostly using pre-compiled regexes in these tests.  The regex version performs worse when the text patterns are new."

I also need a simpler text editor, though, because not everything fit's the IDE worldview of projects. I was using Geany, but I've just started trying Atom.

Since I started with computers in the 80s, I've fallen into the lock-in trap quite a few times, and I know how difficult it can be to get out of. I've become wary of anything that resembles lock-in, be it format lock-in or familiarity/know-how lock-in. These days I'd rather take the upfront bother of learning a truly free tool, even if it has a steeper learning curve.  PyCharm might be okay though. I see that it uses the Apache License for the CE, which is good. JetBrains is privately held, which is also good, as long as it lasts, since it allows for less focus on monetization and focusing more on a more long-term vision.  They still have to find a balance between openness and money-making though, and the incentives they have are all wrong. For example, JetBrains has no incentive to make it easy for external developers to implement functionality which competes with their extensions. Quite the contrary. It would be easy to just skimp on the documentation of the plug-in API, for example, or fail to keep it current.  Incentives nonwithstanding, they might be on the ball on these issues. I haven't looked into it. If they are, then kudos to JetBrains for doing the right things. But it might not stay that way. Chances are it won't, given enough time.  Me, I'd rather take the safe route with a completely free tool. For the record, I've gone with Eclipse/PyDev, but YMMV."

Often the supporters of free software get so wrapped up into the idea of access and openness that they fail to see the failure in their logic.    If you generate code it is very hard to say that it is locked to the IDE, after all it is your code.     Now there are issues where an IDE might help the developer out with IDE specific make files and the like.   Assuming you understand your code and how it is to be built this isn't a lock in either."

Actually I look at this as a good thing it means any fees for PyCharm end up feeding developers.  In some places this is a bad thing, but at least with a privately held firm a greater percentage of your fees go to feeding working programmers.    As it is I currently use Eclipse and PyDev for the little bit of Python programming I do.   I simply don't spend enough time programming in Python to go IDE searching.   Eclipse works sort of OK and supports many other activities that I engage in.    As a side note I keep Vim, in some form, around on all machines that I use.

Python,3avakp,pvkooten,4,Tue Jun 23 20:03:56 2015 UTC,"I am not ready to give up the interactive way of quickly testing some code. Perhaps tests & interactive should be combined?   You've identified the crux of the problem that keeps so many developers from writing tests--it's a matter of developing habits. It seems like it's easier to just fire up your program and fiddle a bit to make sure it works. Fortunately, you've also identified the failing of that approach to testing:   but now that I'm more interested in making some larger projects, I feel like I should be more test/tox/py.test focused.   Testing has economies of scale. For a one-off script with no side effects, running it a few times manually is sufficient. As you start developing bigger applications and integrations across systems, some of which you may not own, it's simply not feasible to run it a few times to see if it works. The most important thing to accept--you'll have to reassure yourself of this while you're developing habits and experiencing it the first few times--is that you will be more productive writing tests for your code. Substantially more productive.  That's not to say interactive (functional) testing isn't important. Something else you'll learn to accept that is that you can prove a lot about the correctness of an application without demanding interactive input. When unit and integration tests can give you great confidence about the quality of the code, you can reserve functional tests for making assertions about cohesive features and behaviors and significantly improve the cognitive load devoted to testing."

I'd call this ""exploration"" rather than ""testing"" for the sake of differentiating the ideas in the context of this conversation. I spend a lot of time in an iPython shell exploring how atoms of code will work--it might be fetching some JSON data from an API and examining its structure or deciding how best to iterate some data.  At the point I have a true ""unit"" of code (a function or a method), I write tests. I mock out the inputs in order to put the logic under test, and when I'm happy that it's logically sound, I write integration tests to make sure it works correctly in a ""real"" environment (say, fetching data from a MySQL database). Should one of these tests fail, though... it may take some interaction to find the cause, in which case dropping to the debugger from the test framework is really useful (pytest --pdb is your friend).  Definitely get comfortable with pytest and tox. pytest is bar none the best testing framework for Python and tox will make it easy to fake different environments in which to run your tests.  e: accidentally a word"

Also don't underestimate how writing testable code can will improve your code quality (especially modularity/coupling).   As for the start: ""spiking"" (I think thats the TDD term) interactivly to get a first idea of the problem and solution is not forbidden. But having even just a few easy to run testing routines will make your life so much easier. Bringing up the REPL and typing the same 10 commands is not easy because you will not do this before every commit (I've been there).   The same for bugfixes. Ever have done the same ugly bug years after because you forgot that little detail? Write a specific test and it will be saved.  If you start simple, you soon will get to the point where testing solutions like py.test/tox and TDD will be something you want to use/do.   As for the changing tests. I don't really understand what's the big fuzz about changing your tests to fit to your changed design. Maybe it's because for me tests are much more than just a ""contract"". They show me where there are problems in my design and therefore eventually will someday. And its satisfying to see the 30 lines with several clauses shrink into 5 easy to understand lines."

Let's imagine somebody came along and said ""Hey! We are building a web client app that we want to consume a RAML-generated REST API and use the Elasticsearch query DSL to interact with endpoints, and we want our client to be HATEOAS-based."" That would be awesome and we would be into it.  I would also like to mention, that using RAML allows you to generate a JS client library from the spec which can then be used in any Backbone/React/Angular/Ember/etc app. This effectively provides the same level of ""convenience"" that HATEOAS seems to promise in terms of having clients that ""just know"" how to consume a given API.

Main difference is that Ramses creates everything (views, models, routes, auth, etc) out of a RAML file, no coding, unless you want to write custom stuff which you can.  Ramses is based on Nefertari which is a lot less opinionated but requires to write views/models. Nefertari is like cornice except it uses ElasticSearch for reads and Postgres or Mongodb for writes."

For ramses you can extend the underlying nefertari app with custom processors before or after validation and also subclass models, views, serializers etc. For example for one of our clients we implemented a custom view that uses events from a normal ramses model and renders them as an ical feed.  Ramses is just Nefefertari + RAML, and Nefertari is just Pyramid + ES + DB. We have designed the stack to be extensible at any layer in the obvious ways.  See ramses-example: https://github.com/brandicted/ramses-example/blob/master/ramses_example/__init__.py  See nefertari-example: https://github.com/brandicted/nefertari-example/blob/master/example_api/models/story.py"

Python,3apmp8,Lolmarmalade,3,Mon Jun 22 23:56:39 2015 UTC,So I have worked on an API similar to the one you speak of. It would give a client an ID of their task (celery as well) and then the client would continuously ask if the task was complete. This just seemed like such a waste of resources and we eventually came up with a callback mechanism (give the API a URL and it make a very specific request to said URL to let it know its done with the task).

Python,3arjcn,Nikosssgr,2,Tue Jun 23 01:26:19 2015 UTC,"Both modules and classes provide namespaces (=independent containers of names that help you organise them and avoid collisions with other names. e.g. when you import a module and use module.name). So at first they might seem that they offer the same thing but there are at least 3 big differences between them:   Multiple instances : You can have only one module object (when you import a module you create a module object). But with classes you can have many instances of a class and each will be different object (aka have different state) Customization via inheritance: classes can take advantage of classes(namespace) inheritance which support a much more customization code (e.g. class SubClass(SuperClass) ) Operator overloading : hooks that classes can use to intercept and implement any built-in type operation which can make your user-defined classes behave like built-ins (e.g. __and__ method responds to ""+"" operator -if your object is on its left)   So, although now that you put many classes in a module it seems worst that just having just modules, when the codebase gets larger and more critical (or even more people start to contribute) using classes (the OOP tooling) will give you better structure and more tools to express your mental model into code. Plus everyone uses OOP so it will be easier to use other people's code."

Python,3anuxz,acutesoftware,20,Mon Jun 22 16:46:29 2015 UTC,"The things I've learned developing on Windows are:    Use Python 3.4 - apart from being the latest stable version, pip works seamlessly out of the box on Windows. Install it to C:\Python34, and if you want you can install 2.7 as well to C:\Python27 As per Linux, always include #!/usr/bin/python3 at the start of your python module - Windows uses this to correctly launch your module in Python3 even if you have 3.4 and 2.7 installed at the same time Notepad++ is a great text editor. I had to do some fiddling to get a Python function list - https://github.com/acutesoftware/dev_setup dont be tempted to use Windows specific things like paths 'C:\data\my_app.cfg'. Always use os.sep  [EDIT - use os.path.join instead of os.sep] Scheduling python programs to run on the windows Task manager is hit and miss. It sometimes works well, but on some versions it simply doesnt work. Make an EXE to call the python program and schedule that instead."

It's at least less of a shift coming from Sublime.  My personal workflow (on OS X) is edit with Sublime, run programs in Terminal (I'm fairly certain I'm neglecting some capabilities of Sublime in this regard). I think you should be able to do something comparable in Windows. I'm sure there's more efficient workflows but it's pretty decent in terms of not being totally dependent on my normal setup when running on another machine.

PyInstaller and such can be a great way to distribute your Python app later on, if you don't expect a user to have a compiler, but if you don't have a large number of compiled requirements you can always write a setup script that downloads binary installers and runs them for users on Windows."

What's happening is really that in py2 it doesn't matter what the file encoding is, there is no validation, you just get a read out string, that's not a proper unicode string, u'Räksmörgås'  but a normal string containing unicode.  This shouldn't ever have worked, but it did. Mostly by accident.

Python,3aoom9,nsfyn55,10,Mon Jun 22 17:08:41 2015 UTC,"I don' t know are you ready? Knowing how to write python is the easy part. I interview extensively in python for the web. And one of my stated goals is ""Separating wheat from chaff"" in terms of professional developers and people that read ""Learn Django in 24 hours"" starting 25 hours ago.  I usually separate these folks with two sorts of tests. First I ask them to describe the request pipeline in a commonly used stack LAMP, PAMP, etc. This will imply knowledge of the WSGI middleware specification. It steps the developer out of the primer material and into the space I really need. Namely someone that can build and maintain a production web application. This process is conversational the candidate gets bonus points simply for being able to speak intelligently with me in the way that I would speak to a colleague. The best understand the whole underlying suite of protocols and a little about database administration in addition to being a competent python programmer.  The second thing is an understanding of how to build software as a unit. When I got started in programming I was absolutely perplexed by questions like ""how do two people edit the same files at the same time?"". I mean to the point of being obsessive about it. The answer to my questions turned out to be an ocean of tooling, techniques, and theory related to software life cycle. Writing software is like writing a short story with 10 people. It requires a certain disposition and a passing understanding of the state of the art in collaboration. One of the best ways to ferret out this knowledge is by talking to people about lifecycle related tools jenkins, travis, gulp, grunt, linters, etc. The best candidates will know all about these because they are keenly interested in the best ways to deliver software in complex environments. Experienced programmers can talk about their successes and failures with these tools.   I think the most important take away for you is that companies aren't looking for ""python programmers"" they are looking for the sorts of people that identify as ""python programmers"". With that being said you should interview and see how you do. If you don't get the job or you are being walked to the door then ask why? Keep learning and land that first job. This may require a little luck.  Keep learning still and you develop that stuff listed above(and more). Then it'll be easy."

I was an admin assistant in an engineering firm, but on my resume I only listed the IT related stuff I did for it (networking, SW, etc.). Eventually, I got on as a tech writer and web-developer for training material on an IT project, and now I'm a developer and head of QA on a great project.   TLDR; Get a non-related degree and then > 1. Pad your resume > 2.Get your foot in the door on an IT project. > 3. Prove  you can do technical things and take on more responsibility > 4. Pad your resume > 5. Get the job  If you're meant to do something and have the nous and determination, you can break into this field. People care more about what you can do, , than your degree."
Python,3aoom9,dimino,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:48:52 2015 UTC,"Apply for jobs. Write out a resume that is ""programming"" oriented. See how far that gets you.  If you find that you don't have anything to include, or don't get replies, then study job postings to see what kind of skills you can acquire.  It's not up to you to decide ""Are you capable of landing an entry level position"", it's up to you to apply for jobs and see if those companies deem you worthy.  I do believe that github and personal projects are enough to land you jobs, as long as you discuss them with passion. The fact that you are self-taught and super motivated is going to help you a lot.  For what it's worth, I am a self-taught, newly employed software developer, and your story is similar to mine. Now that I've been working, I've seen lots of co-op students with zero github and very minimal coding experience, and they are in computer science -- you can easily differentiate yourself by doing lots of personal projects.  Also, I agree with the (idea behind the) very downvoted comment below: you don't want a ""python job"", you want a programming job. That would be like a carpenter saying he wants a circular saw job. I know you spoke about HTML, CSS, JS, etc... so I know you're not trying to pigeonhole yourself, but do keep in mind that you can just as easily start writing Node.js, or PHP, or whatever, as you can Python, if you take even a small amount of time to experience those languages."

Since they both short-circuit and both can take an iterable as argument (not just a sequence), you get the beautiful result that they stop iterating and return as soon as a result is found. For example:  if any(field is None for field in row):     discard(row)   This will stop iteration and return True as soon as a None field is found.  Note the difference between this and using a list comprehension:  if any([field is None for field in row]):   ...   In the latter case every field is tested whether it needs to be or not. The use of a generator expression could save a lot of time, especially if a complex function is being evaluated on each iteration."
Python,3apycw,donnieod,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:38:48 2015 UTC,"This is the python idiom that I always find myself struggle with:   Simple is better than complex.   Unfortunately, I did not learn python as it should ideally be done, but my learning came from a quick crash course of the official docs. My C# and Java background doesn't help me either!  The result is that I don't generally follow the pythonic way when doing a certain task like say, implementing a collection or a function. I automatically tend to do it like the C#/Java way which cause unnecessary problems later on.  For instance, the pythonic way insists on not using a loop as much as possible (since python is interpreted and loops will slow it down). Hence you have shortcuts like slicing list[x:y] that allow you to crop a part of your list based on indices. Another popular example is the python list comprehension:  S = [x**2 for x in range(10)]   But since Java and C# are compiled languages, we guys tend to use the raw or ""brute-force"" method without thinking:  S = [] for x in range(10):     S.append(x**2)   This second way of generating the list of squares is less optimal than the first, simply because there is one less operation in the loop (S.append()), and also because there is no another declaration step (S = []). Compiled languages don't bother so much about this, perhaps because loops come at cheaper computing power in their case."

This isn't true.  Often the Pythonic way is to use a loop even when another construct is available, because the loop is often clearer to understand.  Python definitely isn't designed for optimal processor performance, it's designed for optimal programmer performance.   Hence you have shortcuts like slicing list[x:y] that allow you to crop a part of your list based on indices.   That's not there to avoid a loop, that's there because it's a readable, concise way of representing a very common concept.

To truly realize the value of microservice architecture, you need to have solved the problems of testing, CI, CM, service discovery, deployment, monitoring, metrics, and so on. If you haven't figured those things out, you're in for a world of pain when your fleet grows beyond a handful of services.  Third, if you're convinced microservice architecture is the way forward, for the love of all that's good, don't use Django. Don't even think about it. The most important advantage of microservice architecture is that the services are small, with few dependencies, easy to test, easy to build, easy to deploy (in the context of your automation effort, that is). Assuming you can hold true to the ideal that interfaces are sacred and represent a blood-bound contract for all of eternity (because you don't want to leave your service consumers high and dry, right?), you don't need much more than something that speaks HTTP, knows how to talk to one database, and shits out JSON.  Your intuition is solid. It's probably not worth the cost in terms of complexity.

Chris McDonough (from the Pyramid framework, http://www.pylonsproject.org/) uses the ZODB in the application server Substance D (http://www.substanced.net/)  For more info on how to use the ZODB check http://zodborg.readthedocs.org/ and http://blog.startifact.com/posts/older/a-misconception-about-the-zodb.html.  The transaction module also works with SQLAlchemy (zope.sqlachemy), so you can mutate the ZODB and you relational database of choice in one transaction (the changes are commited to both the ZODB and the relational data, or none).   There's also no need for ORMs, or for DB migrations scripts. If you need a data migration, just write a python file or add some properties to your classes :)"

Python,3aoseb,yenzenz,3,Mon Jun 22 12:11:14 2015 UTC,"ZODB is primary a transactional way to store python objects. The filesystem or ZEO-server based way to store the already pickled objects with its ids and transaction information is decoupled from the actual storage implementing code. So there are different storage backends possible.  If its difficult to sell the ""python-database"" there is also a storage backend for ZODB called ""RelStorage"" storing the ZODB into MySQL, PostgreSQL or even Oracle.   RelStorage is complete transparent. Client side nothing changes (except configuration).  From my experience the customers problems with ZODB are more about the ""exotic"" ZEO-Server (even if this software is mature) than about storing python pickles. So telling customers ""We just need your DB-admin to create a new database in your existing PostgreSQL"" lowers the barrier a lot."

Every new problem I met, I asked on IRC, and the worst scenario was like ""oh, it's in the new release"". The worst problem was updating my Ubuntu installation repos so it fetched it manualy.   When it comes to NoSQL databases - not ZODB, I can't recall the name of that product, sorry - every learning step was a disaster. I was like ""oh, handle references manually, why not"", ""rebuilding indices? okay"", ""no data type validation? ok, cool"", and then when I was about 20% done with my new project (that used that shiny NoSQL stuff everyone was hyped about) I realized, that this is a dead end.   Maybe that's me and my traditional approach to data. Maybe that's just my projects and my requirements and my clients.   But today I WOULD NOT TOUCH NoSQL DATABASES, even with a 20-feet long stick.   Don't get me wrong. I use Redis. I keep Django sessions there. Perhaps some caching.   But that's all.

You like RDBMs, I like OODBMs. Let's drink a beer and enjoy Python :)  The docs says ""Python object serialization"": https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html. So shush, my friend :)  It's pickles all the way down. So, your object is picked and that data is stored in a file. Then the data stream is unpickled and you'll get an instance. If your class definition mentions an attribute that does not exist in the DB, then you'll get an AttributeError. This is normal expected Python behavior, ie when obj.__dict__ misses an entry:  >>> class Foo(object): ...     this = None ... >>> foo = Foo() >>> print foo.this None >>> print foo.that Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module> AttributeError: 'Foo' object has no attribute 'that' >>> foo.__dict__['that'] = 'hi!' >>> print foo.that hi! >>>   I hope this sheds a bit of light on how the ZODB works!

Python,3am7c4,NeedsMoreTests,6,Sun Jun 21 17:07:10 2015 UTC,If you're asking someone else for good ideas then you need to focus on coming up with some ideas and implementing them yourself.  That's part of the point of programming rather than just doing what's already been done.  Most companies today will care more than you can come up with an original idea and implement it rather than just proving you know a specific language.  You seem to already have a mix of skills so if you're looking to add Python to your resume why not combine Python in some way with your existing skills to make something useful?
Python,3am7c4,billsil,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:12:53 2015 UTC,"You need to just look for ideas.  What do you want to do?    I run an open source tool for an fea code.  It's better than multiple commercial programs out there and it's free.  There's nothing else that even comes close to doing what I do in the open source world.  In that case, it makes sense to start a new project.  I didn't start it to show off.  I started it because I wanted people to use a comprehensive tool instead of fighting with trivial tasks and always supporting some limited subset of the functionality they should be because they spend so much time dealing with an overly complicated interface.  Also, it's nice to get user's bug reports, bug fixes, and new features without even asking for them.  If you don't have an itch like that to scratch, find something like Django or scipy or matplotlib or some other library that is well known and you're interested in and help out with it.  If you don't know what libraries are popular in a given field, a bit of googling or some questions will help.  Regardless of the project you pick (or start your own) nobody is going to turn down new features or bug fixes.  You learn a lot when looking over other people's code and working on a huge code base.  EDIT:  The way you make something good is you make it wrong every possible way and fix it.  It takes a certain mindset in order to manage a large code base and I wish I knew I how to teach it.  The whole one class per file idea has nothing to do with it; you have an IDE, so use it.  It's obvious to say group relevant functions/classes, but that still doesn't tell you how to organize your code into an easy to use structure.  The best I can say is come up with multiple use cases that pull your code in very different directions.  My code has 3 main aspects:  a user wants to 1) read/write/edit/operate on the data to determine things like area/volume (speed isn't a huge deal here, but the interface is) ; 2) the user wants to run an analysis (matrix access time is critical, but the interface and upstream data structure takes a back seat) 3) display the model (data organization becomes critical).  You kinda just have to do it, have a little foresight or have done it wrong 6 times.  There are literally parts of the code base, I've rewritten from scratch 6 times (hopefully that part is finally done)."

Most of the time this ended up being an overly complicated and opaque way of working. Excel is really good at what it does, and if you need to see/sort and edit the data while visualising it in real time in excel charts, it is better to leave it in excel. Especially if you will receive data in excel, show your working to others in excel and send it off in excel format.

Then upvoted :)  I got a computer engineering degree but it took me a very long time to realize the scope of programming...including things I knew already how to do, but doing them in a manual way. Like opening (i.e. downloading a webpage), which then leads to learning how to scrape (i.e. a faster way of reading and copying) from webpages, and then storing that data into a database (i.e. a faster way than copying/pasting into a spreadsheet).  Today I spent a couple of hours writing some functions and a couple of command-line tools to:   Detect faces in photos  (via OpenCV) Resize and crop (if necessary) a photo to fit a set of given dimensions.   Obviously, I've done all of these before, via Photoshop. I've even done some of this by code. And there may already be some Pillow function that does #2. And of course OpenCV face detection using the default training files is nowhere near what you'll get with commercial programs...but this is what I needed to do:  Given 1,000+ photos in which I know there's a prominent face, find the boundaries of that person's face, add some padding around the forehead and chin (because the face-patterns are typically bounded at the eyes and lips), resize those dimensions to 400x300, and crop if the given facebox is too big.  Even if it took me 5 days to write the scripts, I would still be saving time...but being able to crop all those photos for this project is not even the main point...I wanted to freshen up on argparse and numpy, for other projects. And if I ever have any other face-detection/auto-cropping needs (which is quite frequent, actually), I have this good-enough tool to work from.  Getting a computer engineering degree gave me confidence in being able to tackle programmatic problems...but figuring out to use programming to make my life better is what made me a real programmer."

Python,3am7c4,POTUS,2,Mon Jun 22 03:34:36 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar position as you a year ago.  I am an Excel power user, but entered the MS in Predictive Analytics program at Northwestern University and I was first exposed to Python in my first class.  We delved into machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, etc) using Scikit Learn.  We also used Pandas, which was very comfortable for someone used to working with spreadsheets.  I immediately saw the value in Python and I then had the idea to automate some of my existing business intelligence solutions (previously in Excel) using Python.  Since going down that path almost 11 months ago, I have built a fully automated business intelligence solution using Python (pandas, numpy, etc), Tableau, and a Ubuntu VM on my company's internal cloud.  I created the data pipelines using our existing ETL tools (SAP business objects) and created schedulers to send data via FTP to our Ubuntu server an a recurring basis.  We also pull data from various APIs that come in JSON format as well.  The work we used to do in Excel was essentially data wrangling/cleansing/munging by combining multiple datasources into datasets the executive team needed to manage the business (lots of VLOOKUPs). By creating schedulers sending our data to the server and performing the data wrangling via python, we were able to increase the frequency in updates to our existing dashboards and eliminated the need to hire more data analysts to build new reports or dashboards (allowed us to scale exponentially vs linearly).  We then created some helper functions to work with Tableau's Data Extract API to create our TDEs and pushed the extracts to Tableau Server leveraging the tabcmd utility.  Reports/Dashboards that only were updated quarterly are now updated hourly due to the automation python afforded us by going down this path.  The reason for me providing my story is to show you the possibilities learning Python can have on your day-to-day job.  Before I would say I was an Excel jockey (as many B school graduates become), but Python really changed my job and provided immense value to my organization.  My business intelligence solution has been getting attention from other areas in my company and I am now in the process of helping others architect my solution for their organizations as well.  Python has changed my career for the better and I can honestly say I love going to work every day because of it.  Best of luck!"

I use/contribute to projects hosted on both platforms and I've come across numerous shortcomings with BitBucket:   Search (BitBucket does not have it). Sometimes the docs just don't cut it when you want to figure out how something works (or maybe why it doesn't). It's rather inconvenient to have to clone the whole repo, open your editor of choice and search with that. The pull request interface just isn't as friendly as GitHub's (or even Stash). PR discussion and the diff are all dumped onto one page. Side-by-side diff view is slow. It's basically opendiff in a modal and you can't add comments from it. Creating a pull request is actually not very intuitive. The first time I tried to make a PR on BitBucket, I almost gave up because it was really hard to find the link to create a PR. Turns out, you have to go to your fork, head to the ""Branches"" page and select ""Create pull request"" from the kebab menu on the side of the branches list. On GitHub, there are numerous intuitive ways to do this:   You get a button on the repo's homepage when you push a new branch that you can click to make a new pull request. There is a ""New Pull Request"" button on the PR list for the project and its forks. There is a ""Compare"" link on the branches list of each project that takes you to an interface where you can create a Pull Request.  Being able to use Travis CI is a huge plus (also mentioned by the py.test team) The GitHub commit status API is another awesome feature that BitBucket doesn't have.

Python,3aivor,yetanothernerd,6,Sat Jun 20 19:45:26 2015 UTC,"nose started off as a test runner that could run unittest-style tests or pytest-style tests.  I think nose got traction originally because it was packaged better and easier to install than pytest.  (These days, both are packaged well and you can easily install either with pip.)  But there's been some syntax drift, as pytest has added features and nose has failed to copy them.  For example, pytest has setup_method, which (if present) runs before each test method in a test class.  nose doesn't support it.  I have a project with 211 tests, which all pass in pytest; 50 of them fail in nose because of that.  If you restrict yourself to the subset of pytest features that nose also supports, then your tests will work in either.  Also, plugins.  pytest has some plugins that nose lacks.  nose has some plugins that pytest lacks.  And then there are things that they both have a plugin for, but one plugin might be better than the other.  If you rely on a particular plugin then you might choose your framework based on that."

Certainly Flask is impressive in how fast you can get it up and running initially, which is an advantage that arguably declines in importance as a project gets bigger."
Python,3ahf2l,riksi,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:29:11 2015 UTC,On the flipside. I've used Django extensively but I haven't ever used Flask. Django is much more complex and scalable than Flask seems to be. Django can be used for small projects and easily scaled up to very large ones with less effort than Flask. But if you're going for small projects than Flask probably has way less overhead. At least that's how it seems to me.  Flask looks really interesting because it's much smaller and presumably faster. I've considered using it as a static site generator with Frozen-Flask.
Python,3ahf2l,RecursiveInsanity,2,Sat Jun 20 17:26:53 2015 UTC,I think flask is better in both small and big projects (did the tutorial on django and reading alot about it). You know why it's good on small projects. I think it's better also on big projects because:   sqlalchemy is better on big projects (more custom exotic features) sqlalchemy-alembic is more mature than the django alternative jinja2 is better than django-templates (i know you can use jijna2 on django) less overhead   While django has bigger community + more jobs + more libraries.

Python doesn't make that guarantee (although there may be Python implementations that do tail call elimination, you shouldn't depend upon it), and GvR has resisted adding it to CPython and making it a guarantee that Python provides you. You should use a while loop instead:  game_over = False while not game_over:     human_choice = get_player_choice()     computer_choice = get_computer_choice()     game_over = compare_choices(human_choice, computer_choice)   As for your question - where is the ""function inside of a function?""

It's still some kind of copy/paste and violation against the DRY principle. For instance, the flask template ships with default 404.html, members.html, register.html and many other pages. I feel like it would be much better to have these defaults either in Flask itself or a small framework around flask that provides sane defaults that we can simply override. The same is true for the Django template. That way if somebody discovers a bug in one of these pages, we don't have to fix it in everyone's projects, but we just fix it once in the library and everyone can upgrade to the next version.  You know, if we take this to the extreme, it would mean that we stop using libraries at all, and we put all portions of reusable code in the cookiecutter templates.  I understand that it's easy and I understand very well the problems that it's trying to solve. But after using it, there is only a manual upgrade path and the more code that was generated, the more needs to be maintained manually.  So, my purist mind tells me that if there is a reusable portion of code, then it should be in a library. If there are variable parts in that portion of code, these variables should be passed in through the constructor of that system.   I wonder what other people here are thinking about this approach... What is your experience?  Cheers."

Providing templates like that is absolutely not a job of Flask (which is often used for API servers with no serving HTML at all!), nor of Django, nor of any web framework. They are tools designed for practically infinite number of use cases, many of which don't fit into a pattern of ""regular website with user registration"". If anything, this funtionality could be offered by a CMS built upon Flask/Django/etc.  That Cookiecutter makes those templates part of standard Flask scaffolding is just an indication that it's overfitting to a particular use case. Which is I guess inevitable if it is to be of any help at all, since the really shared skeleton of all Flask applications is essentially the same as all Python packages, plus somewhere to put the app.run() call in."

Not that time you have is not enough (it took me one article and 2 hours to learn enough python to start using it on a daily basis, not much more to go through standard library and language reference), but if your goal is to find a job quickly, then focus on learning enough to do it, and figuring out which parts are needed for that. However if you truly want to learn it, here are few tips:   First thing to learn is how to learn quickly. Learn about ipython, and those functions: help, dir. Keep python shell open all the time and use help to get at least overview of all the functions/modules/concepts you'll use. Try to use them immediately in various ways, to see if you know them really. If you learn something new, try to use it with the things you learned before and think how they could be connected.  Now you can get language basics. Official tutorial is good for that. Go to bookstore and look at few books. Pick one and read it whole. Don't skip things you don't understand - understanding will come later, but concepts and terminology will be useful immediately. With time you'll learn to connect things you understand with things you didn't understood before, and that's really helpful. You got the basics now, so you can go to python standard library and language reference and fill the gaps. Whatever you learn, learn fully, Do not leave a line of code you don't get entirely. This is usually the hard part for beginners, as it means that to understand one line you need to understand exception, to get that you'll need to understand error handling and various ways of doing it, and to get that you'll need to understand... and so on. This is often massive time sink, but that's how you learn. If you have a problem with  that, you may reconsider if programming is for you, really. If you got that far, congratulations, you know python now, go and use it. You may start learning sql."

Here's approximately what I did/should have done/recommend:   Download and install python from python.org if you don't already have it. Which version you use will probably depend on which learning resource you decide to go with. Pick a book or online tutorial thing to start with. I would recommend Learn Python the Hard Way (sidebar) if you like getting bossed around (Type this exactly how it's written. Don't worry about what it means right now, just make something that works.) or codecademy's interactive python course if you want something a little more hand-holdy. After that you should have a pretty decent grasp of the basics and syntax. Find a MOOC you like to get into some more advanced stuff. Coursera has some pretty good classes that come and go. Personally I like MIT's Intro to Computer Science and Programming because there are extra homework projects and everything is downloadable. Check out the online exercises in the sidebar. Also codeabbey which is pretty good but not on there for some reason. For real world examples, look on github for python projects. Maybe even start your own if you can. Most importantly, whenever you come across a concept you aren't familiar with, google it, especially if it seems to pop up often.     Probably the best advice I can give in general is to write some code every single day. It's important for you to actually use the concepts you read about or you'll get out of practice and/or burned out."

One section in there uses Python 2.7.  Personally I say do 3.  People picking up Python who don't need to maintain projects written in 2 should be using 3.  Guido mentioned this at PyCon 2015, we need to be making a better effort to move to Python 3, and I think one way to do this would be for new literature like this to start writing based on Python 3.

Python,3ae6jq,patrys,5,Fri Jun 19 13:55:47 2015 UTC,So the reason WTForms works(sort of) is that it is a concise abstraction. It models a very simple concept ... an HTML form. It then layers on a single orthogonal concern...validation.   Part of its beauty is that it only really works with primitive data. Answering lots of Questions on SO about this lib helped me understand that a lot of folks miss this point. WTForms is not about data integrity. Its not a way to bind your models to forms. If its used sanely it doesn't have any interaction with your application's storage. Its a way to model an HTML form in python and layer on validation.   Interestingly in this very simple playground you still end up with tons of complexity and contradiction. BooleanField in a FieldList breaks the abstraction.. There is difficulty with Falsey values that are also valid inputs(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23982917/flask-wtforms-difference-between-datarequired-and-inputrequired/23984389#23984389).  Libraries that work and get traction tend to model well-defined concepts(e.g. html forms) that are present in a wide range of applications. The more you deviate from the well-defined concept the more complexity and contradiction you will face. The more you deviate from problems that actual people have the less adoption you will get.  So the question is what is the concept you want to model?
Python,3ae6jq,remyroy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:36:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response :)  I suppose I just hit the limits of the scope of WTForms and needed to use something else.

It is primarily intended for validating data coming into Python as JSON, YAML, etc. colander - A system for validating and deserializing data obtained via XML, JSON, an HTML form post or any other equally simple data serialization. schema - A library for validating Python data structures. Schematics - Data Structure Validation. kmatch - A language for matching/validating/filtering Python dictionaries. valideer - Lightweight extensible data validation and adaptation library.   I'm personally using flatland to handle my form stuff but I would not suggest it since it has been abandoned a while ago. If I were to do it again, I would probably go with voluptuous since it follow the same principles and it keeps things somewhat simple.  In any case, you always need to adapt your form data submission into your model somehow. It is possible to automate some part of this adaptation (django does it to some point I believe), but it is still needed and can lead to complex situations that will always be hard to automate.  Check these other libraries."

WTForms gives you these wonderful base classes that look like - if you were using any other form lib - they should fit your every need, but the mistake is believing that the classes are a concrete end product that you must bend your data into.  During the period of WTForms hatred, I looked at anything that could be better, but ultimately everything I found used an almost identical pattern of metaclass magic that it really didn't matter what I would have picked.  So now I prefer WTForms, because I know that it's just for composing, relating and validating request data, and not a magical serialization/deserialization package that can read my mind when I pass it my model data."
Python,3af7of,yaph,10,Fri Jun 19 17:16:21 2015 UTC,"That's a rather basic overview. One key thing he doesn't mention is the plotting style context manager.  If you use something like plt.style.use('ggplot'), it enforces the changes on all future plots, which is not something you may always want since the changes from this command will remain in place till you either restart your kernel, or set the rcparams variable back to the defaults. This makes it difficult to switch from one plot style to another.  To overcome this, you can use the plotting style context manager:  with plt.style.context('ggplot'):     plt.plot(x, y, 'r-o')   This limits the changes to the local scope without polluting the styling for all future plots.

The real benefits of style sheets are in how you can separate various aspects of the plotting styles you may need to use in different contexts. Hence, the context manager, as /u/Covered_in_bees_ describes. It is a cool new feature, although I personally haven't had a use for it yet. I already have custom defaults which I like, and then I manually set things differently for specific plots if needed. Maybe over time I will notice some patterns and push them into style sheets."

You'll need this: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/intervaltree/2.0.4 and this: https://github.com/chaimleib/intervaltree/pull/31  Assuming you have a list of lists of 2-tuples, you can do this:  from intervaltree import IntervalTree from functools import reduce  def overlap_intervals(self, other):     splits = (self | other)     splits.split_overlaps()     self_int_other = IntervalTree(filter(lambda r: self.overlaps(r) and other.overlaps(r), splits))     return self_int_other  # Eyeballed from your first three data sets datasets = [     [(1.07, 1.12)],     [(1.01, 1.03), (1.09, 1.12), (1.18, 1.22)],     [(1.04, 1.05), (1.09, 1.11), (1.16, 1.17)], ] trees = map(IntervalTree.from_tuples, datasets) trees.merge_overlaps()  # may not be needed?  print(reduce(overlap_intervals, trees)) # IntervalTree([Interval(1.09, 1.11)])   One last thing I found interesting:   most of what I've found has involved sets, but that works only with integers   Your data itself may be a continuum, but the upper and lower bounds of your intervals comprise a discrete set!  Take any given interval in the ""final result"" interval set, and look closely at its upper and lower bounds. The upper bound must have been present as an upper bound in the original intervals, and same goes for its lower bound.  So it turns out that all you really need is a set whose elements can be ordered...   >>> i = IntervalTree.from_tuples([('Alpha', 'Beta'), ('Beta', 'Gamma'), ('Alpha', 'Gamma')]) >>> i.merge_overlaps() >>> i IntervalTree([Interval('Alpha', 'Gamma')])   Ultimately, this IntervalTree thing doesn't even know it's dealing with numbers! :)"

Python,3abs1i,sandwichsaregood,2,Sun Jun 21 06:49:21 2015 UTC,"I'd like to because PyMC is really flexible and that is quite handy for what I'm working on. Some of the comments there indicate that they haven't seen much of DREAM in the literature, but it has a decent mindshare in the uncertainty quantification community due to its good parallel scaling and ability to deal with multimodal distributions. Along with GPMSA and QUESO/DRAM, it's one of the three MCMC methods being developed Sandia's DAKOTA project, which is quite a major project.  I'd also like to implement delayed rejection. It's relatively simple and since the adaptive Metropolis bit is already in PyMC that'd be a complete DRAM implementation. DRAM is efficient enough that you can actually consider using Metropolis sampling for realistic models and is quite cheap. It's asymptotically guaranteed to beat the performance of normal Metropolis, which is always nice. DREAM is immensely complicated whereas DRAM is pretty simple, so I'll probably do this first.  Implementing these in Python is actually a great fit for my work because mostly my models are calls to external simulations. For me, the overhead of the sampling procedure is tiny relative to the model evaluation cost, so sacrificing some efficiency in the Python code is a drop in the bucket. The benefit being that PyMC is super flexible, so I can insert all sorts of different things into the process and do what I need with ease. I'm rather busy right now, but this is definitely on my todo list over the next year or so."

As a junior you solve a linear regression problem using least squares, an approach which goes back to really old guys like Gauß and Laplace; when you get promoted to a senior position, you apply a Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm. Even the data are impressed by that amount of hyphened scientific credential and surely the line/hyperplane already fits much better."

If you fail and the real world makes an unexpected turn and all your habitually ""guessed"" normal distributions have to thrown out of the window, you can blame hyphened chains of modern statisticians, which is much different from failing like grad students who are fishing for p-values and don't properly apply cross-validation.

Python,3agkus,jhermann_,1 point,Sat Jun 20 11:55:15 2015 UTC,"The first command clones the git repository.  It will create a directory textteaser as a subdirectory of the current working directory.  The second command installs all the modules that the authors of the TextTeaser module consider dependencies for using their code.  pip by default will install in the system location(*), which will fail unless you are running this as root, which you probably shouldn't be doing.  A better option would be to run this from within an activated virtual environment, in which case pip will install the modules into that virtualenv and not into the system location.  (*) The exact location depends on the operating system and how/where Python was installed.  pip also takes a --user option which installs stuff under the home directory somewhere.   Wouldn't the user need to install DataTeaser as well?   If your program depends on a given module, then yes, users of your program have to install that module, just as you had to install all the modules listed in TextTeaser's requirements.txt (which is just NLTK apparently, but that's a biggie) to use that module.   Could we instead just download the whole program and then place into our program directory?    There is no ""whole program"".  Modules are designed to work as separate, independent units.  The whole point of the system is that each module is written and maintained separately by different groups of people.  Nobody would ever get anything done if they had to write and maintain everything themselves.  The TextTeaser authors are certainly not interested in maintaining an entire fork of NLTK in their own repository; that would be insane.  There are programs that can bundle an application and all its dependencies for distribution as a single unit, such as cx_Freeze, py2exe, py2app, etc.  But unless the project specifically goes out of its way to offer those kind of builds (and hardly any do), it doesn't change the situation at all.  If you want to offer users of your program a bundled build, then feel free, but it's too much trouble for too little gain for most projects."

The usual way of doing things is to represent your web application's top-level handler as a function that takes a request and returns a response; most programming languages do it that way. It is the right abstraction, because that's what a web application is: a thing that takes a request, does things, and returns a response.  But PHP doesn't work that way. PHP says that a web application is a directory hierarchy filled with all sorts of stuff, some of it PHP scripts, and it should be served and routed like a static website, except that when the server encounters a PHP script, it should run it and serve the output instead. This is both limiting and dangerous, and compensating for these problems is difficult and takes a lot of effort - way more than the convenient deployment is worth, really.

Before you try PySide or PyQt on its own, have a little search about their webkit version and search for an example app that loads any page, so that you can test the specific website you'd want to load. I found out that the javascript and css frameworks I was did not work that well, but that was an specific problem on my dependencies and should work fine for a lot of cases.  Cefpython itself is only the ""webview"", so you still need a GUI toolkit. The cefpython website and repository contain examples using different frameworks, the wxpython being the most prevalent and feature-rich one, but if you don't need to worry about OS X, there are good simple examples in PyQt and Kivy for Windows and Linux. If you decide to go the wxpython route, I had to combine the windows, linux and mac wx examples into one that works cross-platform, as there are some differences to take into consideration (link to the source code if you interested).  Full disclosure, I stopped using cefpython with wx because I need to pack the applications in self contained executables. I was using py2exe and pyinstaller and run into quite a few issues getting the builds to run on multiple distributions with different versions of libc (even though I was building with older versions for backward compatibility) and other issues on os x (windows was fine). So I moved to Electron (nodejs), having it launch the python server executable on the background, and saved me a lot of headaches.

If you don't control the webpage, write a simple browser extension in javascript.    With say a userscript (tampermonkey in chrome/safari or greasemonkey in chrome, you just add a simple user script like:  // ==UserScript== // @name         Reload page every 60 seconds // @namespace    buoyancy_issue // @version      0.1 // @description  reloads page every 60 seconds // @author       djimbob // @match        https://np.reddit.com/* // @grant        none // ==/UserScript==  setTimeout(function () {     window.location.reload(); }, 60*1000);   This reloads the any current reddit page every 60 seconds when the URL matches https://np.reddit.com/*.

Python,3ad4sr,__add__,2,Fri Jun 19 03:44:53 2015 UTC,"The ""lighter"" persistence options already mentioned are the right way to go. But...  As an exercise, there are a few different ways to do it without sqlite, redis, etc. (Still, don't actually do this. It's just an exercise meant to carry the idea through to show where it goes.)  Keep your dictionary in an ordinary text file (can still have extension .py, doesn't matter). Rather than importing as a module, write a function to read the file in as a string, run eval on it, then return the ""fresh"" dictionary. Or ast.literal_eval. Now the problem--this is the point of the exercise--is how to use the dictionary without reading it in and parsing every time you want to access it. In general there are two ways: notification based (filesystem) and reloading at some regular interval you set.   (Notice how conceptually these are like ""conjugates""--thinking in this direction, i.e. about handing changes, signals about changes, knowing when you can make a changes ""blindly"" etc. starts to go in the direction of locks, mutex, concurrency, and all that, which will begin to give an idea of what database transactions are about and so on.)  Looking into the first option will show you some stuff about the filesystem and signals. And you'll get some idea of how to use a module that handles this (like watchdog). So that can be worthwhile.  The other way should get into caching which is obviously important for something like a flask app. Here's some code to look into that idea (python3):  def memoize(obj):     """"""ordinary memoize from      https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary     """"""     cache = obj.cache = {}      @functools.wraps(obj)     def memoizer(*args, **kwargs):         key = str(args) + str(kwargs)         if key not in cache:             cache[key] = obj(*args, **kwargs)         return cache[key]     return memoizer  def flush(decorator, every=60):     """"""     TTL or time to live:     'flushes' or resets a decorator     periodically; e.g. with simple      memoization      >>> @memoize     ... def func():     ...     return time.time()      Here `func` will always return the     time of its first call.

I might change it to allow other palette names. The nice thing about only having integer keys is that you can loop over the palettes using (a range of) those keys.

Python,3a4zm6,Teract,5,Wed Jun 17 16:36:13 2015 UTC,"Lines of Code doesn't have great correlation with performance.  It's what those lines of code are doing that is important.  With almost every language, from Python to C, you're expressing a program in one form, and it's being converted into a final form for execution.  That final form will include optimisations.  What you write isn't necessarily what is run, because there are all sorts of things the interpreter or compiler can figure out from the code and carry out automatically to improve things.  Here's a practical and very simple example in C where line count doesn't equal faster performance.  It's called loop unrolling, which most C compilers will do for you automatically, where appropriate:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling#A_simple_manual_example_in_C  In that example we've gone from 5 lines to 9, but gained in speed because a for loop contains overhead.  Before you go off and start unrolling loops yourself, remember that compilers are doing it for C at compilation time automatically, and the same is true for the Python runtime.  So how do you make stuff run smoother or faster?  This is true for any language:  Profiling.  Oftentimes our instincts about where the application is spending the majority of its time working aren't necessarily where it is actually spending the majority of its time.  Profiling provides you detailed information about which methods are steps are responsible for the most processing time.  There's a reasonable introduction to some of the main profiling options for python here: http://marcobonzanini.com/2015/01/05/my-python-code-is-slow-tips-for-profiling/  I would also encourage you to watch this talk from Pycon 2014: Fast Python, Slow Python.

Python,3a4zm6,sigzero,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:25:23 2015 UTC,"Section 4. A simple manual example in C of article  Loop unrolling:       A procedure in a computer program is to delete 100 items from a collection. This is normally accomplished by means of a for-loop which calls the function delete(item_number). If this part of the program is to be optimized, and the overhead of the loop requires significant resources compared to those for the delete(x) loop, unwinding can be used to speed it up.  As a result of this modification, the new program has to make only 20 iterations, instead of 100. Afterwards, only 20% of the jumps and conditional branches need to be taken, and represents, over many iterations, a potentially significant decrease in the loop administration overhead. To produce the optimal benefit, no variables should be specified in the unrolled code that require pointer arithmetic. This usually requires ""base plus offset"" addressing, rather than indexed referencing.  On the other hand, this manual loop unrolling expands the source code size from 3 lines to 7, that have to be produced, checked, and debugged, and the compiler may have to allocate more registers to store variables in the expanded loop iteration [dubious – discuss]. In addition, the loop control variables and number of operations inside the unrolled loop structure have to be chosen carefully so that the result is indeed the same as in the original code (assuming this is a later optimization on already working code). For example, consider the implications if the iteration count were not divisible by 5. The manual amendments required also become somewhat more complicated if the test conditions are variables.

They are inherited from parent to child, so unless you are a child of the Python process, you don't have access to them.  This is really more of a form of a bidirectional pipe (which is also anonymous) than a socket.  But you can still disrupt communications.  Multiprocessing also uses things like a shared memory-mapped file, and you can figure out that file's name and open it.  It will be named something like pym-<unique identifier> under the temporary directory.  However, this is all pointless.  The file will be owned by the user and group of the person running the Python program, and that file will be only readable by that person and group.  So either the attacker is the same user, in which case all bets are off — you could attach to the Python process with a debugger and change any aspect of the program, regardless of multiprocessing or not; or you're not the same user and there's nothing you can do to disrupt another user; or you're root and you can do anything you want regardless of multiprocessing.  So worrying about the specific implementation details of multiprocessing seems pointless — if you have the permission to do that, there are much worse things you can do."

Python,3a9fwb,stuaxo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:04:19 2015 UTC,"Depends how you use the multiprocessing module.  First let's talk about the IPC methods that multiprocessing uses: pipes, named pipes, unix sockets and network sockets.  Now pipes, named pipes and unix sockets are protected by the ""normal"" os user system. So as long as the python process and the attacker program run with different users and permissions are set cautiously, the attacker shouldn't be able to mess with it. (If both programs run under the same user the attacker could just kill the process so why bother with disturbing its IPC)  With network sockets on the other hand, there might be ways to at least do a denial of service or something.  So the question remains: how do you use multiprocessing?  For simple stuff like a parent and multiple childs multiprocessing will use pipes and these are protected by the os.  As soon as you use managers and start them on a network port you're in hackable territory but it will be more complex than just sending data :)  Take this all with a grain of salt since I learned it from skimming over the source code of multiprocessing and I might be wrong."

If they're using some of Python's objects that wrap the lower level socket interface then input from the socket may already be filtered out before it reaches the application.  If not then the application author is, usually, going to discard any input they don't understand rather than try to process it because it's easier.  Finally, if you have permission to access the socket you probably have access to better/easier ways of disrupting the application rather than sending input to the socket.  Killing the process or removing resources, such as files on disk that the application uses, would probably be the easiest.

Replace 'utf-8' with that the file is actually encoded with (see chardet).   x = f.read() x = x.decode('utf-8') # decodes from utf-8 into unicode   That still won't give you a word LIST. To do that you would have to split the list about spaces, for example   >>> ""hello there how are you"".split() ['hello', 'there', 'how', 'are', 'you']   Python 3 uses unicode internally, not ascii, and this is the recommended way to do this (all Python 3 strings are unicode). If you need to write ascii, just .encode() when you save the file. Always convert to unicode when you read in, work internally in unicode, and then save as whatever you need (it defaults to utf-8). Otherwise you'll have to keep track of exactly what your data is, and you will end up throwing random .decode() and .encode(). It's not worth it.

If you take a look at the given example, you can see that they use an comparison operator in both expressions. 1. 2 <= 2 and ""Alpha"" == ""Bravo"".  Those comparison operators are comparing a value and will give you True and False as a result. Next, you can chain those results with logical operators (e.g and ; or).   For Example:  True and True == True  True and False == False  False and False == False  True or True = True  True or False = True  False or False = False  Now, if you look at your bool_three, you're missing your logicial operator in your first expression. So what python does, it converts the result of 6+8 to a boolean (True or False). In numeric value, True means everything greater or lower than 0, false means exactly zero.  That means, the expression 1+2 equals to True. As you use the logical operator OR your whole expression equals to true.  You could for example replace it with "" 1+2 == 4 or 8+7 <= 1"". The boolean will then hold false, as the excercise demands it.  It worked out in bool_two because 6+8 results in True AND 9+10 does not equal 55 and this will result in True"

Eg. try typing ""1/2"" in the console, and compare this against what happens when you type ""1/2.0""  The reason is that when dividing two integers, by default, python will use integer (truncating) division.  Ie. ""3/2 will give you 1, rather than 1.5.  However, if one of the operands is already a float, python will do floating point division, and you'll get a float result.  You can change the default behaviour in python2 by putting  from __future__ import division   at the top of your module, after which all division will allow changing type to floats.

Python,3a2jlj,Funnnny,18,Wed Jun 17 04:32:32 2015 UTC,"edit: I think the ages example is not just unhelpful, but actually a straight-up incorrect explanation of the is operator.  It sounds like you're making the point that, while your_age and my_age may refer to semantically equal values, they are not the same reference. That's correct, but the conclusion seems to be that your_age is not my_age; however, the is operator doesn't compare reference identity. Even if we're both 21, perhaps your_age is my_age, or perhaps not.  Consider the following program:  your_age = 21 my_age = 21 print your_age == my_age print your_age is my_age   Try running it—you might be surprised! In this program, your_age is a reference to an object with the semantic value of the integer 21, and my_age is a reference to an object with the semantic value of the integer 21. The == operator compares the semantic values of the two referenced objects, which are identical. The is operator compares the identities of the two referenced objects, which, in CPython, actually are identical—but this only holds for certain integer values, because CPython maintains a global pool of commonly-used integer objects to share across the program, to improve performance. To my knowledge, there is no Python operator to compare the identities of two references like your English example describes; is doesn't actually do what your English intuition led you to believe.  Technical details aside, I think the important takeaway here is that these concepts are actually incredibly hard to understand from intuition alone. What is a reference? an object? equality? identity? These definitions aren't obvious; they require a rigorous understanding of the Python specification, and articulating these concepts in English requires a whole ton of precision. For this reason, it's super unhelpful to belittle folks who are having trouble understanding these concepts; in my experience, they're the single most difficult hurdle for newcomers, because a fully correct understanding requires more rigor than usual :/"
Python,3a2jlj,matchu,6,Wed Jun 17 04:37:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, the issue is simply that technically your age is not my age, as one refers to your age, and the other refers to my age."

I agree that the formal distinction is valid—I just didn't like the parent comment implying that folks who don't get it are dumb. The distinction between reference and value is probably the single hardest concept in an intro CS course, and the instructors of those courses will tell ya that a correct English articulation of these concepts is incredibly difficult to get right.

Or maybe you do want an interpreter, but it's outside the usecase of code - maybe it's in a web browser, GUI or has other input than the console, for instance.  Or you're writing ipython and want to provide more functionality than code.  Or it's for a web template language.  Or you're doing some complex metaprogramming.  And so on.

Making things more complicated does not help when you're evaling code, regardless of what actually ends up invoking the eval.

There are real cases where x == None and x is None will return different results.  This will come up when something overrides __eq__ - for instance, there's nothing stopping me creating a class that returns True when compared with None.  If somehow some instance of my object manages to get into your comparison, you can get the wrong result.  To give a real example I've seen in the wild, take something like the below code:   def __eq__(self, other):      return self.string == str(other)   This was from a class representing a text node in a document, indended to be used when comparing against literals, or other text nodes.  However, consider what happens when the node contains the string ""None"" - now this will return True ""x == None"" tests!  Another case to consider would be code that throws an exception when compared to an unexpected object.  Cases like these are why is is the right thing to use - it defends against weird, unexpected objects like this.   yet in a case where it makes a difference   I think the big issue here is that the semantics of True are such that it shouldn't make a difference.  ""True"" is not really an object you should be using as a sentinel.  Its use is designed around things being, well, true - not just being the same object as the True singleton. A case where you care about this distinction seems like one where you've chosen the wrong object to indicate the distinction.

Also, I disagree with the premise of your post.  You should be using is, but not when you want to compare two objects for equality.  The is operator is for checking if two variables point to the same object.  Python does not make primitives true objects, though, so you should only be using is on defined classes, not built-ins.  It's also very, very useful for determining if two collections are the same without comparing their elements.  Comparing large collections can be costly, but if their ids are the same then the comparison is performed in nanoseconds.  For example in IPython:  >>> class Dummy: >>>     def __eq__(self, other): >>>         return True >>> x = [Dummy() for _ in range(100000)] >>> %timeit x == x 1000 loops, best of 3: 1.97 ms per loop >>> %timeit x is x 10000000 loops, best of 3: 38.7 ns per loop   And it's only this fast because when you use == on lists Python first tries comparing the ids before it calls == on the elements:  >>> y = [Dummy() for _ in x] >>> x is y False >>> x[0] is y[0] False >>> x == y True >>> %timeit x == y 10 loops, best of 3: 167 ms per loop   There are use cases for these operators in Python, that's why they exist.  Instead of advocating against their use, you should strive to understand why they were added in the first place and try to educate others on how to use them properly.  A good example is eval.  I used to think eval was a necessary evil in Python, then I watched a talk by Raymond Hettinger where he talks about his use of eval in the implementation of collections.namedtuple, and how no one has ever asked him how it works after reading the source because it's intuitive.  It immediately convinced me that my understanding of eval was wrong, not that eval itself was."

For example, instead of  x = [] if x:     print('non-empty')   I will do  x = [] if len(x) == 0:     print('non-empty')   My reasoning for this is because too many times I have been burned by changing a variable's type (maybe I'm switching between collection types, for example), or the function returning the value now can also return None, or the function returned something I didn't expect.  These are subtle bugs to track down, and I'd rather save myself minutes or hours of debug time by spending the few extra seconds it takes to calculate the actual length.  It's less error-prone in my experience.  It also helps when most of my team members came from the embedded C/C++ world.  It makes the code more readable to them.  Now, I'm not saying that I have this problem often, most of the time I'm calculating a boolean and then just doing if varname or if expression, but on the rare occasion I have to handle a variable that can be truthy or True, and I want to handle that difference.  Many may say that I should have that wrapped up in another class, but my programming style says that it's ridiculous to create a type that is only used in one location to handle something so trivially done without it.

The point of this post was to try to explain to people what ""is"" does (and doesn't do), and to describe the situations in which you might be lulled into thinking that it's doing something it's not."
Python,3a2jlj,zardeh,13,Wed Jun 17 06:23:06 2015 UTC,"I guess I've never come across someone using is when they should be using ==, most people I meet end up using == when the should be using is instead.  I do feel that your title should be more like ""When you should and shouldn't use ""is"" in Python"", since your post makes it sound like the is operator should be avoided with prejudice."
Python,3a2jlj,wheezl,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:49:16 2015 UTC,"I think you are too used to dealing with professional developers rather than the audience the article was intended for.  (Inexperienced people like me - who don't know the difference, but now do and even though the title says almost never can still understand it uses when needing to test object identity).   Great article by the way!"
Python,3a2jlj,Lucretiel,0,Tue Jun 16 21:01:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe the title should have been different -- but over the years of teaching Python, and seeing how often people misunderstand the difference between == and is, I've come to the conclusion that the safest thing is just to tell people to use ""is"" with None, and under no other circumstances, until they know better."
Python,3a2jlj,zardeh,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:18:36 2015 UTC,"Rather, I'm saying that in most cases, you shouldn't be using it.   I think that's misleading though.  Using is is not ""almost never"", it's actually ridiculously common.  Eg. the usecase you mention of checking against ""None"" is something that people do very frequently, not some weird once in a blue moon case.  Eg. here's a quick look at the python stdlib to get some estimation of usages:  $ grep 'is None' *.py | wc -l 787 $ grep 'is not None' *.py | wc -l 508 $ grep '==' *.py | wc -l 2834   So about 30% of the time it'd use either == or is, it uses is, just for that one usecase.  That alone seems a long way from ""almost never""  I only did it for the None case, since searching for just is gets you a lot of strings and comments too, but just eyeballing the results shows that None is far from the only case where it is frequently used, even in just the few pages of results.  Eg a few usecases:    Checking for class or abstract base class identity (eg. if subtype is _InstanceType in abc.py) Other singleton sentinel checks.  Eg. ""x is NotImplemented"" or ""x is not SUPPRESS"" in argparse.py Traversing recursive strucutres to avoid loops.  Eg. in collections.py you'll note things like while curr is not root   In short, ""Almost never"" seems really misleading, when the real story is likely more like ""somewhere between a third and half the time""."
Python,3a2jlj,Lucretiel,0,Thu Jun 18 09:33:54 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, although I find it a bit hard to believe that real-world applications use ""is"" between 1/3 and 1/2 of the time.  I mean, I tend to do way more comparisons with actual values than with None.  Indeed, I don't tend to do that many comparisons with None at all.  But maybe that's just me.  How about this: Perhaps the number of times you'll use ""is"" is large, but the number of use cases is very small.  That's probably closer to what I meant."
Python,3a2jlj,Lucretiel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:39:13 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, although I find it a bit hard to believe that real-world applications use ""is"" between 1/3 and 1/2 of the time.   I just gave it a try with a largish application (calibre) in case library code is markedly different, but pretty much the same results there: 1914 for ""is None"", 2273 for ""is not None"" versus 6667 for ""=="", so 39% there, again just for the None case.  In fact, trying a few other things, I may have underestimated the range.  Eg in sqlalchemy, I get 788 ""is not None"", 558 ""is None"" versus only 577 ""=="", so it actually makes up 70% of usages there.  Most of the other things I tried were around 35-40% (matplotlib, IPython, twisted).  The biggest outlier in the other direction I found was numpy at just 24%.  I think the use of None is just a lot higher than you might expect - a huge number of things use it, to indicate things like ""no default arg passed"", ""nothing specified - fallback to default case"", ""value missing"" or as a failure / no result case for lots of functions (eg. re.match, dict.get etc).    Conversely, even when you're comparing values == may not be as common as you might think.  For booleans, it's better to omit it.  For integers, other comparisons often get used (ie <= or > etc), for objects is is often actually what you want, leaving just strings and enumerated values as core usecases.  Give it a try on your own code - you might find you use it more than you thought.   Perhaps the number of times you'll use ""is"" is large, but the number of use cases is very small. That's probably closer to what I meant.   The problem with that is that it's very hard to quantify exactly what counts as a distinct usecase.  Is any use of None a single usecase? Or should you count the different meanings assigned to None (sentinel, failure, missing value, default, database null, mapped null pointer etc)?  Conversely, what is a distinct usecase of ""==""?  Is ""color == Green distinct from color == Red?  What about age == 42  - do we count distinct types, distinct meanings, distinct values or something else?  In addition, now we're not counting how frequently they're used, there's a large number of rarely used, but meaningfully distinct usecases for is in general, which need to be counted the same way.  Ultimately, unless you really fudge the criteria, I don't think you can really say one way or the other which there are more usecases for."

Python,3a5vf8,graingert,2,Wed Jun 17 19:06:21 2015 UTC,Here's how my Entries look on sqlite.  http://imgur.com/z37XkIM  I think it's sufficient to what I need. The only problem I was really having with it was querying it similarly to the way it was setup to the INI file. I also had problems trying to add a list to the table so I had to use json to dump it.
Python,3a5vf8,ies7,3,Wed Jun 17 19:13:36 2015 UTC,"I just try scripting with random data (500k rows, 5 columns, approx 32Mb.) only using csv and hashlib module.  Basically it loops through all rows, calculate the sha1 of every row, and matching the result with a simple if-then-else against one column.  timeit the function with ipython takes averages 3.8 seconds (not calculating the hash takes 1.08 second).   Printing/Displaying all 500k result to the screen takes 11 seconds (not calculating the hash takes 8 seconds).  Unless your data grows to gigabytes or at least >300mb, I don't think using sqlite even with index on specific column will make your program significantly faster. (and generally  matching data is more of number of rows instead of number of mb)  I think the bottleneck is in the hash calculation and displaying/printing out the reports.   All said, sqlite is still a better option than an INI file. Maintaining the data will be more 'sane'.   Tools for sqlite (or other sql) are better than INI files.   And by the time your data explode you can always add some index or perhaps upgrade it to something like postgresql (or other sql/nosql db)"

Python,3a1y5e,makaimc,3,Tue Jun 16 16:26:27 2015 UTC,I love Pony ORM - its fantastic
Python,3a1y5e,STLEON,2,Wed Jun 17 12:50:32 2015 UTC,"ORMs, I just don't see the point.  Just too much overhead for something that is really not that hard (SQL).  If you are going to use a database as a tool don't you think you should take the time to learn how to use it properly?"
Python,3a1y5e,xmstr,3,Wed Jun 17 11:23:00 2015 UTC,"The simple answer is: SQL isn't composable.  If you have one filter {key1:value1} from one routine, and want to add a second filter {key2:value2} that you got from a different routine, with an ORM you can just merge the dicts and throw them at the ORM query.  When doing string-smashing to generate SQL, you have to escape all keys/values, assemble them yourself, and remember where in the query you are (have you said ""AND"" yet?  does this need to wait for the ""HAVING"" clause?).  It's much worse if the two keys are columns in different tables.  I mean, UTF-8 isn't hard, either, but we've figured out that best practice is to decode bytes to characters (i.e., a native programming language type) on input, process data as characters, and then encode to bytes on output.  An ORM is no different: it lets us work with native programming language types as long as possible, and encode to the database syntax just before talking to the database.  Or look at HTTP, or JSON, or any other text-based format: they're not hard to write, but does anybody actually do that?  That's what we've got libraries for.  I've worked on projects that don't use an ORM.  Either you have a ton of redundancy (and your methods are hard to unit test), or you've refactored it all into a custom SQL query generator (which is essentially a ad-hoc poorly-designed and untested ORM).  Every decade it seems to be fashionable to hate on some new technology that writes code for you.  I saw it with assemblers, and then with compilers (""If you're going to use a CPU as a tool don't you think you should take the time to learn how to use it properly?""), and with regular expressions, and garbage collectors.  These days it's ORMs.  And of course, with every new generation, people insist that all the old improvements were obvious and necessary, but the latest one is the tool of the devil that will rot programmers' minds."
Python,3a1y5e,programmyr,2,Wed Jun 17 15:26:14 2015 UTC,"That is exactly why I wrote Peewee. SQL is awesome, and by wrapping things up in Python you can get a lot more re-use than you would by manually munging string fragments. For example,  following = (User              .select()              .join(Relationship, on=Relationship.to_user)              .where(Relationship.from_user == current_user)) tweet_timeline = Tweet.select().where(Tweet.creator.in_(following)).order_by(Tweet.timestamp.desc())   The above query re-uses the subquery (for capturing a user's followers) to construct a query to build a timeline of tweets by the given users."

Python,3a0o79,sisukapalli,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:12:40 2015 UTC,"OP, not sure if you are Joris (author of the Notebook). I took a quick glance at it, and tbh, I got lost very early on with this statement in the notebook:  data['1999':].resample('A').plot(ylim=[0,100])   I'm relatively familiar with pandas though I don't use it often enough to remember the API off the top of my head. The above line of code has no explanation in the notebook, and is not at all obvious to a lay person. What is 'A' supposed to signify? What is the `data['1999':] doing? Why use resample? What does it do?  If someone has to go back to read through the pandas docs to answer these questions, then the Notebook as a tutorial loses all value.  Perhaps there is an accompanying video that would have answered these basic questions, but without that, I'm not sure if this is the best introduction to Pandas. The official docs and tutorials do a much more rigorous job of explaining things."
Python,3a0o79,Covered_in_bees_,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:34:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not the author of this notebook but I wanted to give more exposure to this notebook since I learned a few things from it. resample('A') is documented to mean 'year end frequency'. Hence the statement plots the mean per year (default of the resample function) starting in the year 1999. Agreed, ""Introduction"" is a bit of a misnomer here. Better would be 'An advanced introduction to Pandas' ;-)"
Python,3a0o79,Covered_in_bees_,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:53:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know that it's documented, but it's not a great case study example to introduce Pandas if the author doesn't at least have a few sentences explaining what he's doing. To be honest, I don't think a time series based example was a great example case study for an Intro to Pandas notebook. Handling datetime objects is in general a giant pain in the ass and the syntax in his example isn't obviously intuitive in terms of what it's doing.  I did notice that the author does explain things in more detail after the case study so I guess it might not be a bad idea to skip past the case study if it ends up being confusing.  I will say that I've also found the documentation and tutorials on the Pandas website to be great at introducing various features/concepts in Pandas."

There might be a bug with the ping method. Knowing nothing about the internals of all this, the pooling method for ES could be doing some multiprocessing so the exceptions are happening there?"
Python,3a2erd,elbiot,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:51:14 2015 UTC,Don't see any multiprocessing here. The module only does a query and response at the time it gets called.

When I run this from a script, the traceback doesn't even go back to the calling script.   The other possibility is something is getting munged during a shutdown process, i.e. ES is not connecting, then a del method is getting called or something. You would really need to run pdb. I just want to emphasize again this is not normal behavior -- something is off, likely with either ES or with the urllib chaining exceptions."

You can do it with following command:  sudo sed -i -re 's/([a-z]{2}\.)?archive.ubuntu.com|security.ubuntu.com/old-releases.ubuntu.com/g' /etc/apt/sources.list   And then you need to update aptitude cache:  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade   Afterwards try installing libcurl4-gnutls-dev or straight up python-pycurl:  sudo apt-get install python-pycurl   That's assuming you don't use virtualenv.

This is how I have become really good at solving algorithmic problems and it helped me a lot in my Google interview.   For example in your 1.py you should realise after having solved the problem that you can solve it without storing all of the multiples and in a single loop:  sum(value for value in range(1, 1000) if value % 3 == 0 or value % 5 == 0)   This solution is O(n) and using constant memory space.  Then of course you may realise that the sequence of multiples looks quite familiar, so:  3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + ... = 3(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + n) = 3 * n(n+1)/2   Then you can solve this problem in O(1) complexity.  # solution = Multiples of 3 + Multiples of 5 - Multiples of 15 =   n = 1000 n3 = (n-1) // 3 # number of multiples of 3 n5 = (n-1) // 5 # number of multiples of 5 n15 = (n-1) // 15 # number of multiples of 15  solution = (3 * n3 * (n3 + 1)/2) + (5 * n5 * (n5 + 1)/2) - (15 * n15(n15 + 1)/2)   EDIT: Also if you aren't so interested in the algorithm side then I think Project Euler is not the right place for you, there are much better online challenges that exercise more of your python knowledge than math/algorithms."

I spent a day trying to convince it to use a particular installation of python to build some project (possibly even opencv, I forget).  It insisted it knew better which python to use, and I could not convince it otherwise.  I ended up editing the makefiles every time I needed to rebuild them; I ended up writing a python program to go and fix it up for me.  So, Hooray, I wrote my own build system fixer.  The best answer is: write a good, clean Makefile for your project.  Use something to generate it (cmake, autofoo, whatever) if you like, but don't try to make your package build on any system.  If you need it on another system, add a new Makefile (generalizing where possible).  If someone else wants your code and you're not familiar with that system, let them write the makefile.

Python,39wbql,Lucretiel,5,Mon Jun 15 21:19:16 2015 UTC,"Nope, __init__.py is only for nothing. Your damn imports mean that I'll see a repr somewhere and not realize that what debugging information calls foo.bar.Bar should be called foo.Bar. Bonus points for circular import issues. Leave your __init__.py files empty. If you don't want a level of namespace, don't introduce a package. Don't have situations where order of imports matters. If you simply have a non-cyclical dependency tree, this happens automatically. If you have circular dependencies, refactor them out of your code so that you don't have extra complexity to think about. Put your exceptions where they belong. For a small project, this is very likely one place. For a large framework with multiple layers of stuff various places, it almost certainly isn't. If my code includes networking APIs, an HTTP implementation, a JSON-RPC implementation on my HTTP implementation, and an remote object abstraction on top of that, my remote-object-related exceptions don't belong the same place as the networking stuff. Relative imports are mainly good for one reason: they will create an error if you try to run a file from inside your package. (This can lead to subtle bugs if it works.) The blog's reason (2) is a traditional explanation, but one that turns out to be immaterial, and its reason (1) is a misfeature and not stated correctly. See (1). Module size should be as big as it takes to define a namespace. Don't force your poor user to have confusing reprs.

You are importing something from somehere other than where it was defined (for instance, from the __init__.py). Importing from __init__.py is fine for clients- it keeps them simple- but your library itself should generally import things from where they actually live.   There should really never be a case where import order matters. The things you import handle their own imports, so the act of importing shouldn't have side effects.  3: I've recently been convinced this is not best practice, any more than you should define all your functions in a single file. I think that you should define any base classes in their own file- after all, all exceptions in your library should probably derive from a single base class. However, I think it makes more sense to put Exceptions that are caused by specific modules in those modules. If you're hunting through source code to try ""to find all of the exceptions a package is capable of raising,"" it means something has gone terribly wrong in the documentation.  4: Implicitly relative imports (that is, without a . prefix) almost always lead to trouble, especially when you go from a development execution to setup.py install. You should try to avoid from . import X imports, as they encourge the problems I mentioned aboce with locally importing from __init__.py. from .. import x just seems like asking for trouble- it breaks the modularized nature of modules.

Python,39tb7w,NicolasGuacamole,0,Mon Jun 15 04:57:58 2015 UTC,Why is it unusual? Github is a mystery to me.
Python,39tb7w,Lucretiel,25,Sun Jun 14 21:35:31 2015 UTC,"I would say because it will increase the size oft your repository with every release unnecassarily. After 20 releases you are gonna have 20 blobs additional blobs in your repository that are downloaded everytime someone clones the repo to work with the source code. And while git can very efficiently compress the different versions of your source code, it is not able to compress the binary files. Git should only be used for managing the source code of your application and not to store binary builds."
Python,39tb7w,big_deal,12,Sun Jun 14 22:02:23 2015 UTC,"GitHub is for managing code, most people cloning won't be able to, or won't want to run the same binary"
Python,39tb7w,squarepushercheese,2,Sun Jun 14 22:56:53 2015 UTC,"Because github- like all source control- should only be for source files. Be they source code, or document source (in the form of HTML or Markdown), or any other kind of source, any build artifacts (that is, things that are created via source) (such as tarballs, compiled binaries, emitted docs) should be stored and deployed separatly. Putting them in source control obfuscates the central purpose of source control, which is to track human-created changes to the project."
Python,39tb7w,ilikebigsandwiches,15,Mon Jun 15 18:50:18 2015 UTC,"Good for you for creating something to solve a problem. That said my biggest issue with citations is not creating them. It's collecting them, managing huge lists of them by topic and for individual documents, and correctly linking citations and bibliography in documents. I use Mendeley:    For collecting citations I can import from Google scholar or lookup using DOI number.  It does a great job of managing references by tagging, keywords, or folders. It's Word add-in rocks at creating in text references and auto-generating the bibliography. You just click insert reference, search for the article, insert. When you're done writing and you've inserted all the references, you generate the bib. You never end up with missing citations or extra citations that you didn't end up referencing.    Edit: your / you're...whatever it takes."
Python,39tb7w,catnipbilly,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:11:15 2015 UTC,Personally I prefer http://citeulike.org and bibdesk to do the same. I find citeulike way nicer/easier than Mendeleys solution of your core problem : collecting and managing citations.

Python,39tb7w,5225225,2,Mon Jun 15 01:16:41 2015 UTC,"I agree about the overuse of globals as it makes it really hard to track what state is being mutated, but not having a main is entirely a stylistic choice.  However, as the main function is omitted in this code, it would make a lot more sense to put all the ""main"" code at the bottom so one doesn't have to scroll through the entire code to figure out what is being executed."
Python,39tb7w,mfitzp,2,Mon Jun 15 00:21:26 2015 UTC,"Could one argue that putting all the ""main"" code at the bottom is also a stylistic choice?  Personally you should have a main or separate the functionality into a utility library and have a second driver with a main to execute it."
Python,39tb7w,5225225,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:05:38 2015 UTC,"no main   I never use a main function. I do init code at the top and static variables, then the main code at the bottom. Just wondering, why do people use a main function?"
Python,39tb7w,mfitzp,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:32:46 2015 UTC,"Wrapping your code in if __name__ == ""__main__"": prevents it being executed when the file is imported. This is important if you want to use the file as library as well as a command-line tool.  However, sometimes the code under the __main__ might be useful to import and execute in another script. In that case you move it to a main() function (outside the __main__ block) and it then turn the execution block into:  if __name__ == ""__main__"":     main()"
Python,39tb7w,wilsonc001,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:59:47 2015 UTC,"Personally I would just put the functions into a different file, and import that file from the code. Anyone else can just import that file. Imports also can run code if you need to. The main function just looks ugly, and it means that you're always 1 level indented, which if you're following a 79/80 line length limit, is annoying.  However, you HAVE to use a main function if you're writing curses code and you want to use their wrapper so your terminal is reset when it crashes. Other than that, I don't really see a massive advantage."

Python,39tb7w,Jomann,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:02:09 2015 UTC,I use it in a number of places when working with hardware sensors. The file may contain just classes or functions which will be imported elsewhere but I don't want to run-up the main programme just to see what a sensor is outputting.  Putting a short 'main' function in that will write out the current state of a sensor is really handy for fault finding or prototyping a new function.

That said, good on you for creating the tool you needed. You're just in high school so you're way ahead of the curve.  I'd recommend putting either a code example or a screenshot.

These are not contextual abstractions, nor are they necessarily logical pathway abstractions. The scope is fairly limited in this sense, since it becomes very difficult to find terms related primarily through intermediary terms. The holy grail here too is still just out of reach: the ability for the algorithm to decipher true connections from spurious connections, and to decipher latent interaction between terms (example: thing 1 is a type of thing 2, and thing 2 destroys thing 3, therefore thing 1 may destroy thing 3; this is a simple example, and some of it can be sussed out, but combined with spurious connections from incomplete and partially accurate corpora, it becomes much more difficult).  Still really cool when this stuff comes out though, isn't it? Especially when you're just doing a cosine metric (or as is often the case, a hamming distance for high dimensional binary data sets; trivial calculations though!). Hopefully I'll be publishing some of my work in this area soon, and I'll post a link to the pub here (probably 6 months to a year out).

Is this logical? King by definition is the 'male ruler'. 'Woman King' is nonsensical and doesn't logically equate to queen/ It makes sense because I know what each of those words means and infer that 'Woman King' = queen, but I couldn't logically derive that meaning.   In my model the word Thermometer has a similarity of 0.72 to the Stock Market vector and the 6th similar word to it   What were the other 5? Why focus on Thermometer if there are 5 other words more closely related? What happens when you go through all your examples and take the 6th most similar word?   In any case, likening Stock Market to Thermometer is a higher level abstraction.   or just a spurious correlation?

Codebase  The general principle is good, use the same codebase on all possible environments. But I strongly disagree on interpreting codebase as VCS repository. You should never do git clone on your servers, use packages and install your apps with proper package managers. They'll give you versioning, dependency resolution, uninstallation and easy way to get the metainformation for free.  3. Config  You should never use environment variables for configuring your application. Store configuration in configuration files, read them and provide a way to specify a different path to it. Configuration files can be checked into a VCS, either encrypted or not (it doesn't matter), they can be read by sysadmins who will investigate into issues, and they can contain complex types like dicts and lists. I live in 2015 and I don't want to parse strings like in early 90s. We have yaml already. If you're going to store environment variables in some sh file and source it, congratulations then! You've implemented configuration file which is completely unknown by your app, so you can't do live reloads and type checking before starting the app like nginx does, for example.  5. Build, release, run  Symlinks for different versions? Really? Are you trying to implement Java alternatives? If your rollback stage is so simple as changing a symlink, you're should be able to do apt-get install yourapp-version_lower too. Stick with a single version deployed on a single server, don't blow your mind, don't try to understand which version exactly is responding on /.  11. Logs  Never log to stdout except when developing. Provide a way to configure your logging handlers to log wherever needed, and stdout is the least possible citizen here. stdout-based logs are difficult to handle properly, difficult to rotate, difficult to find and to read for sysadmins. Don't use logstash just because somebody said that it is awesome. Start with goddamn file-based logging and if that will be the bottleneck - change your handler.  12. Admin processes  Never, never allow developers to go to production directly, via ssh or remote REPL. If they need it, then set up a ""staging"" environment that should be similar to the production. More people have direct access to the running instance, more ways the application has to die abruptly. Let Ops to do their job."

Python,39tk5d,ikalnitsky,7,Sun Jun 14 17:17:03 2015 UTC,"The python 3 behavior seems perfectly sensible to me.  The idea of it is that if you pass a function that takes multiple arguments, you can pass the arguments in as separate lists. zip_longest's behavior is kind of incoherent in that context.  Now, I can understand the argument that maybe map should only take exactly two arguments, and if the user wants to use a multi-argument function, he can manually zip his lists. In fact, I agree with that wholeheartedly (whatever minor performance gains are to be had here are unlikely worth the confusing syntax).  But if we're going to accept multiple arguments to map the python 3 choice seems like the obvious rational choice.  Python 2's behavior is just crazy though. No arguments there."
Python,39tk5d,NoLemurs,2,Sun Jun 14 21:32:54 2015 UTC,"I think the behavior makes sense.    The point of map in Python 3 is to apply a function over one or more iterables.  I think if it was going to support multiple iterables, the obvious use-case would be to support functions that require more than one input variable.  This, to me, makes map more powerful, and I would personally be surprised if it chained.  As for zip vs zip_longest, zip_longest made sense when map returned a list.  But in Python 3 map returns an iterator.  One of the points of functional programming like iterators is that they are lazily evaluated.  You can have one of the iterators mapped be infinite, which would not work with zip_longest.  Further, for consistency, zip is the default implementation, not zip_longest, and making map follow the default implementation is more consistent."

You can include multiple ""bottles"" in a single app, which is similar to Flask Blueprints.   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4941145/python-flask-vs-bottle  Hope that helps!"

My 'standard' stack is now Nginx->uwsgi->Bottle-> (custom code) -> psycopg2 -> postgres, and all new development in our company uses this.  I usually adopt the unix philosophy of 'adopt the simplest tool to do the job at hand', and Bottle fits that requirement well: receiving and respond to HTTP requests.    Apart from one bug we encountered with file handles not being closed correctly, it's performed excellently for us, and we were able to diagnose and isolate that bug precisely because the Bottle source code is so short."

That may sound odd, I know, but I'm currently working 'actively' on a lot of stuff right now, like doing the Python course on codecademy, doing problem sets in C for a CS course, doing stuff in Unity (using UnityScript or whatever it's called), and JavaScript, etc.  and I feel like I've got more than enough 'lessons' to do and problems to work through.  I'd just like something that I can sit back and read and maybe pick up one or two new things, or even just going over some concepts again, in a more theoretical and less practical way.  Even if it's not specifically in Python and more about programming or computer science in general, that would be great too.  I can completely understand why so many books are built around exercises and problem sets, and I think it's great that so many are, but I'm at a point now where I kinda don't want to pick up a book that wants me to install yet another VM Appliance or specific IDE or use specific libraries for the purpose of working through that book's 'course'.  It seems like everything is trying to be the 'complete' course on whatever, so you have the videos to watch, the pdfs to read, the problem sets to do in the course-specific VM, etc. but I haven't found anything yet I can just sit back and relax to, if that makes any sense."

Unfortunately this extension cannot work with a standard web server, you will not be able to host an app that uses it over apache/mod_wsgi. You need to use a gevent server, and not a generic one, but one that is customized for Socket.IO.  That means that Apache is out (it does not even support WebSocket traffic). Also uWSGI is out (supports gevent, but not possible to use a custom gevent server). As a side note, Python 3 is also currently out, as gevent only runs on Python 2 (through I think there's going to be good news about that soon, working on some ideas to get socketio running on Python 3 right now).  The choices that you have are given in the documentation. Summary:   socketio.run(app), which runs the custom socketio gevent server directly.

Python,39pjhf,iTroll-4s,6,Sun Jun 14 07:23:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing that everyone needs to learn the software engineering or computer science - but at the basic level - teaching programming requires neither of those and can still be useful - it's about interacting with a computer in a precise and general way - more than a GUI or CLI.   Computers are already used in every profession and that trend isn't going to slow down, you will be spending more and more time interacting with a computer to do your job - so you might as well learn how to interact with it more efficiently.   Stuff like writing plugins for the software you use to automate things (eg. plugins for various editors from CAD software to design stuff), aggregating and transforming data for analysis (eg. excel and the likes), etc. doesn't require a broad knowledge of programming, is mostly domain specific and can be explained in few tutorials if the person understands the basics like control flow and variables.  Really it's like saying we shouldn't be teaching elementary algebra because because most people don't need to know stuff like linear algebra. The point is to give you the tools for every day use and to give you a foundation on which you can build if you do need it - the same is true for programming - you don't need to teach algorithms or design patterns to everyone but teaching people the basics of programming will allow them to least have a vague understanding of what it means to program something and recognize when they can apply it."

Take Python and take desktop Linux, which I use. My spreadsheet, LibreOffice, accepts code written in Python (which you can also do with Excel via 3rd party software). PostgreSQL can accept functions written in Python. My accounting program, GNUCash, has two APIs - C++ and Python. My desktop has a scripting framework that works with a few languages so far, including Python. This means I can script my IRC client, my IM client, and my Bittorrent client. I use Calibre to organize my ebooks, magazines and papers. It also can be scripted via Python and since it's written in Python, accepts Python plug-ins as well. I'm thinking of starting a blog - there are several static site generators written in Python that accept Python's ReStructured Text as input. There's a program that can basically replace your shell with Python! My reporting program is written in Java but I can add functions via Jython. My music organizer runs under Mono and uses Boo as its official plug-in language, which is basically statically typed Python. I can also use IronPython though.   And that's just off the top of my head and those things which are only relevant to me. Python is used in many more products, from GIMP to most GIS tools.   I'm involved in some fantasy sports handicapping contests. Now, like you said, I can accomplish things manually. But the ability to do ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) with Python, crunch data, automatically add my wagers and picks to spreadsheets and accounting software, make charts and even soon automatically add my selections to my own blog makes things a lot easier!   Intuitive or not, one size does not fit all in clothes or software. Much software today is made to be extensible and those who can program will be able to take advantage of this and bend their software to their will.

Python,39pjhf,alcalde,10,Sat Jun 13 22:47:37 2015 UTC,"But I do not feel very good how it is showcased as some sort of skill you cannot  personally do without.    You can do better with than without. All around us are these amazing computational machines. Think of them as cars whizzing around. You can wait around and try to find one that's going where you're going and jump on (like a bus). But how much more power and freedom would you have if you could slip behind the wheel?   Every job is not going to involve coding.    Almost every job can be done better with coding because almost everything can be done better with a computer. I became the first hire when a new friend quit the company I was working at and decided to start his own business. At first I was just helpinghim set up a PC (we met when he couldn't figure out how to turn his company-provided laptop on!). It wasn't long before, seeing what he was doing, I was saying, ""You know, I bet you could automate this..."" And thus was born a collaboration in the 1990s that let us take business from companies 12X our size because we leveraged computers intelligently.   This was in the logistics industry. Shipping rates are very tricky to calculate as they can depend on many things. Companies did not want to sit down and spend many minutes trying to calculate every possible way to send a shipment, so they often had ""rules of thumb"" - all shipments from state X to state Y go to carrier Z, etc. When we put rates in place for them we soon realized they left several % savings on the table by doing this. I found a way to automate all of the calculations and find the optimal way to ship each shipment. We charged them a % of the extra savings for this software and in a few years the company was making almost as much from software as consulting!  After many years we went our own ways and I found myself at a billion-dollar company. My friend had taught me what he knew about logistics and now I was a logistics analyst and not a programmer. However, here too, I kept saying ""I bet we could automate that""... There was a bill reconciliation system that spat out so many false positives a person took a whole day every two weeks to sort through them by hand. I wrote some code, crunched some data, found 18 different reasons the system was failing, and reduced the false positives by over 98%! I found ways to take analyses that took my predecessor 3 days to do manually and got it down to code that did the work in 4 hours without human intervention. I found ways that involved pushing key codes into windows and screen scraping to get data out of an old DOS program and import into a modern DB, ending the need for people to manually enter data for hundreds of shipments manually into the DOS program to do rate studies. In the end, my job, while not with IT, began to involve as much coding as logistics. None of this was part of the job description - it was just the benefit of knowing how to code.  I once bumped into a man at an interview who I had done business with back at the first start-up; he was now a VP of pricing for a trucking company. Talking about the value of coding, he confided to me that he had begun to learn VB.NET ""because there are just some things you can't solve with an Excel macro"". He then lowered his voice like he didn't want anyone else to know, leaned forward and said, ""I really like it!""  Programming can open up lots of doors. It's the difference between being able to read and being able to WRITE. It's the difference between being a passive observer of the works of others and being able to take control and bend these amazing machines to your own will.Being able to do this will make most professions - and hobbies! - easier.   Zed Shaw put it this way:   Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good job,  but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food  joint. You're much better off using code as your secret weapon in another  profession.  People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen  and get no respect. People who can code in biology, medicine, government,  sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do amazing  things to advance those disciplines.   This reminds me of when I was in college and all of the computer science kids I knew were applying to join ""Computer Science House"". Not me. When a teacher asked me why not, I explained that at Comp Sci House I'd be a dime a dozen - heck, most people would probably know more than me. But in a regular dorm my skills and knowledge would be much less common (even more so if everyone good was getting into the Comp Sci house). And I'd be surrounded by an eclectic group of people whose own varied skills could be useful to me in exchange.   Zed's saying the same thing and in my own career I've found it to be the case. Put me in a job where there's a lot of people struggling to use Excel and Word to do things that could benefit from a database and some lines of real code and people think you're a wizard. I once lost out on a job because the manager admitted to me they were looking for someone less skilled. What I didn't admit was that looking at what was involved I'd realized I could have automated EVERYTHING. Combined with being able to work from home, I could literally have drawn a full-time salary for what would have been a less-than-part time job by the time I was done with it. :-) Oh well, maybe next time. :-)   Programming might not make you a superman, but it can make you a wizard among those who lack the skill. And as much as it would benefit me otherwise, I think everyone should learn a little magic!"
Python,39pjhf,sososooowut,3,Sun Jun 14 03:45:18 2015 UTC,"It's true that not every job requires coding (in fact most don't). But learning how to program teaches a lot of useful skills that can be applied outside of the programming world. Specifically problem solving by breaking down problems into small distinct chunks, and basic knowledge of how a computer operates.  I spent the first 5 years of my professional life doing a lot of coding, but am now in a field that doesn't require any. I still leverage the 2 skills mentioned above, and also have the ability to apply my coding abilities when the opportunity presents itself.

What's funny is how my appreciation for the ORM shifts back and forth over the growth of our project. First it is great because you can model business logic very quickly. Then you get traffic and it suck because naïve ORM use doesn't scale well at size. Then it gets great again because at large scale everything runs from layers of caches and services anyway and then Django is mightily convenient to write the rules to produce the data.  Anyway, as the presentation notes at end, if you start with a lightweight Flask you will need extra stuff to do anything, like SQL, forms, auth, session etc. By the time you got everything together you kinda assembled a Django again right?

With Flask you have to assemble pretty much all of it yourself but you have the flexibility to do it the way you imagined it and you end up with an elegant solution. Of course the latter way of doing things requires much experience as a developer but IMO it's still worth it."

When they knock off work for the day, they continue to be programmers even when they aren't sitting at the computer programming: programming is not just their career, it is their passion. They read articles and blogs about programming, they write code for themselves, maybe an open source project or three on the side, they answer questions on Stackoverflow, or something similar.  People who tell you there is no advantage to learning a second language almost certainly belong to the first category, not the second.

You will become a better programmer by understanding the differences between languages, and what is common between languages. If possible, learn a language from each major programming paradigm: object-oriented, procedural, imperative, functional, declarative. If you know an OOP language like Java, learn a functional language like Lisp or Haskell. (Expect that to be difficult -- they aren't easy languages. Maybe leave them for when you're a bit stronger as a programmer.) If you know a language with static typing like Java, learn one with dynamic typing like Python or Javascript or Lua. You don't have to master each one, but you need to get past the stage where you think ""this language is stupid"" and can see why others might prefer it over your favourite language.  If you don't have time to learn to program in a second and third language, at least read about them. The aim is to gain insights into programming, not to learn the syntax. Syntax is easy, and unimportant. It is what you can do with the syntax that is important. Reading blogs by people programming in Ruby to find out how Ruby programmers think is not as good as actually learning Ruby, but it's better than being completely ignorant about Ruby."

The main complaint I've heard about Anaconda is that it doesn't use the system Python, but this is confusing to me: I'm not sure why you'd ever want to use the system python for scientific computing or development. For example, on *nix systems like OSX, there are system tools which depend on Python. This means that if you, say, update numpy on your system, you could break other system applications or utilities that you had no idea were using it.  Use Anaconda. You'll be happy you did.  Edit: I'd actually recommend miniconda instead of Anaconda in most cases: it gives you a minimal installation from which you can conda install or pip install any other tools you need.

Easy package install, installing binaries when available (no compiling needed). You can still fall back on pip to install into the environment if the package isn't available to conda. Packages installed to multiple environments are hard-linked, saving space (i.e. if you have two environments with the same packages, the second one takes up no space).   Cons:   By default it includes a ton of packages so it takes up a good amount of space. Install miniconda instead of anaconda to get around this.

Also, it's sort of a pain to navigate to anaconda/envs/envname/lib/pythonversion/site-packages to check out pip installed libraries, but that's also not a real issue and not unique to anaconda.

Python,39p57f,Belaba,12,Sat Jun 13 11:49:36 2015 UTC,"sys.maxint is basically the size of a 64 bit integer (on 32 bit platforms, it'll be 32 bits).  That's the size that your computer can work with natively - performing adds / multiplies etc in a single operation.  However, just because that's what can be done in a single operation doesn't mean you can't go beyond that by making things more complicated.  You just perform the extra steps in software, chaining together multiple values to represent it.  There exist libraries for this in many languages - python just supports this type of integer natively, and handles the details of the implementation transparently.  Eg. once the size goes beyong 264, you can allocate a bigger chunk of memory - 16 bytes, rather than the 8 for a single 64 bit value, say.  The high bits get stored in the first, and the low bits in the second.  When you want to add 2 of these together, you basically do the same thing you'd do when you add numbers on paper:   First add the two low bit values together.  The result becomes the new low-bits of the number. If there was an overflow (ie. the result was bigger than 264), then note that you need to carry an extra 1 to the high bits. Now add the two high-bit values together.  Add 1 if we need to carry from the low bits. If this overflows as well, we've exceeded the 128 bits we allocated.  So enlarge the memory we're using again (eg. to 192 bits), and store 1 in the new high-bits.   And so on.  There are a few additional complications around signedness, and multiplication is a bit more complex, as python uses a more advanced algorithm than the naive one for that, but that's the basic idea.  Just as it'll add more memory when you append to a list beyond what it can store, it'll do the same when an integer gets too big to fit what was allocated for it.  In python2, there was actually a noticable difference between native-length integers (ie <64 bits) and ""long integers"" (ie. when it starts using extra words), though this has been minimised in recent versions to the point that it's mostly transparent (the difference is that the type will be ""long"", rather than ""int"", and an ""L"" suffix is appended to the repr).  In python3, the distinction vanishes completely, with all this handled behind the scenes without leaking the details of how it's actually being stored to the user."

Note that in 2.x there was an unncessary distinction between int and long, where the latter represents an arbitrary precision integer and the former an integer that fits within a single native machine word.

Python does the same thing to store its numbers. sys.maxint is the biggest number that the computer can hold, but Python can represent bigger numbers by storing a bunch of those numbers in a row, in a base-9223372036854775808 number."

I'll use Bottle for web interface of a Windows program, and for a public-facing web app. Single file makes it super easy to deploy in such situations. Unless you need tons of Flask extensions, you would probably want to use Bottle."

(For reference, Flask is about 6000, but has the added Werkzeug dependency).  I haven't used Bottle, but it being in one source file is not a very good argument. You could write a full fledged operating system in one file if you absolutely wanted to, but it would be a logistical nightmare.  If your deployments depend on Bottle being in a single file for simplicity, I'm assuming you're deploying it directly. That means no package management, which again means no clear upgrade path if there's a security problem (as opposed to something like pip install -U bottle && supervisorctl restart app or something, no matter what version of Bottle your app might run). Your deployments have to handle external dependencies.  Bottle still might be great but not for those reasons."

I don't have to worry whether the server only has Python 2 or 3--it works with both. I just need a directory with two files: bottle.py and __main__.py and it works. This simplicity carries into the API, so that when creating my webservice, all I need to do is use a simple decorator and I've got the route setup.  It's not the tool for every job. I wouldn't use it on anything that needed to scale. But, as a dead simple tool for creating a sqlite-backed crud webservice, it's hard to beat.  EDIT: As far as a security upgrade, it's cd and wget. Not a problem if you aren't trying to build a large scale service."

You can just drop bottle.py into your project directory and start using it. Richard Hipp's excellent project SQLite, which is the most used DBMS in the world, also follows this approach: SQLite Amalgamation is a single, 153K lines of code file that contains everything you need to make use of SQLite in a larger project. BeautifulSoup and peewee are other examples of single-file projects.   pip and virtualenv have their set of problems, and there are many situations where using them is highly unpractical or even impossible. For example, when you want to package your Python app for an embedded system or client's Windows PC, you can't just use pip. You can't use pip on systems where fetching dependencies from internet isn't allowed, like production servers I administrate. :) Still, there is nothing stops you to install Bottle through pip on your own server.

But whatever floats your boat, I guess.  Edit: Also, the single file distributions of SQLite and BeautifulSoup are created as part of a build step, it's not a part of default code organisation.  A downside of a single file as a project grows is that everything is parsed and run. If I wanted some model fields from Peewee but nothing else, I have no way of just importing those bits, which could lead to longer application startup time. As mentioned earlier, not particularly lightweight or modular."

Appending to strings is unpythonic largely due to the way strings work in Python. Since they immutable, this recreates the string several times."

We support the same interface, but handlers running in a WSGIApplication do not support flush() or asynchronous methods.   Tornado will happily power a wsgi app, but you're probably better off using a pre-fork server like apache to power the app and rely on javascript (Yeah! Like Node!) for your async work, client-side.  Annecdotally, I've been testing a Flask app under tornado (because apache configs are for the birds) for a while now and been impressed with the performance. But again, all my async actions are performed through JS."

Unfortunately the python ecosystem seems to rely on C extensions more often than other languages (probably because they're a bit easier to use than in other languages).  The point of docker is to bind together loosely coupled services, it's not a cross-compiling tool, so it doesn't really solve anything here.

Python,39k142,spinwizard69,3,Fri Jun 12 07:44:19 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with the 64 bit version.  Everything works fine.  You can find 64 bit versions of precompiled binary packages.  The python.org page offers the 32 bit version as the default because that will work for everyone.  Go to the full download page if you want to choose for yourself.  However, there's a good reason to choose the 32 bit version.  Python data structures are pointer-heavy, which means you pay a significant price for the fact that 64 bit pointers are twice as wide.  Compare:  >>> for T in int, float, tuple, list, set, dict: print(sys.getsizeof(T())) 12 16 28 36 116 148   Against:  >>> for T in int, float, tuple, list, set, dict: print(sys.getsizeof(T())) 24 24 48 64 224 288   The same data takes roughly twice the memory using the 64 bit version.  (These figures are for empty data structures; the picture changes a little bit for fully populated data structures, but there's still a significant cost.)  This is one of the reasons I actually prefer Windows over Linux — I have a choice of what flavor to use.  If you install a 64 bit Linux distro, you're stuck with a 64 bit version of Python, because that's the only flavor packaged.  You would have to build it yourself from source, or use some third-party distribution if you want that, but being able to use your distro's package management system for everything is one of the main advantages of Linux, which you are giving up."

I figured using 32 bit python would help me utilize my limited resources more effectively and my laptop only had 4 gigs or memory anyways, the maximum addressable with 32 bits. However, my code kept crashing with memory errors, despite the fact that I knew it ran just fine within 4 gigs of memory on Linux with 64 bit python. Did some research and it turns out that 32 bit windows processes are actually limited to 2 gigs of memory.

I have experience with Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Arduino is good, because it's low power and instant on, but I am not as efficient with the language. Raspberry Pi is good because I can script with Python, but it requires an OS to boot up and uses more power. A microcontroller that runs MicroPython is the perfect balance! I can run python scripts on a low powered board that is instantly on.  In my limited experience with MicroPython, I have not seen any sort of latency issues. Everything works as expected. The only downsides that I can think of are the comparatively small community, which is growing, and the lack of libraries. As for the libraries, I have not yet needed anything that isn't available, but I wonder if I would ever want something like numpy."

That being said, I am glad to hear of yet another big project supporting Python 3. I transitioned from Python 2 a couple of years ago but I know that the majority are still using Python 2."
Python,39hs73,McElroy-vs-dig-dog,12,Thu Jun 11 23:57:36 2015 UTC,"Spark is a framework/engine for large scale data processing.  Generally, you would look at using Spark if you needed to batch process data on the order of hundreds of GB per day and up, or if you needed to process live streams of data coming in at similar rates.  Typically, one machine would not be fast enough to do something like that, so you need a distributed processing engine that can be deployed on tens or hundreds of machines to process your data fast enough.  As with any distributed system, fault tolerance, task scheduling, and other such things need to be built in so that your data processing jobs don't crash or hang whenever the network or a machine in your cluster hiccups. When you have a large cluster of hundreds of nodes, or a cluster that is running continuously for weeks at a time, this is a relatively common occurrence.  Finally, you want a nice API to program against for your data processing. For example, Pandas offers the DataFrame abstraction and a set of associated methods for doing various things like counting, joining sets, and so forth.  Spark provides all of the above: A distributed engine, fault tolerance etc., and a clean API.  So you write a program in Python against the Spark API and deploy it to a cluster running Spark to do the data processing you want. Here's an example Spark program that just counts how frequently words occur in a document.  Spark also recently introduced its own DataFrame API, directly inspired by Pandas (and R). The idea is to give programmers a development experience that is as close as possible to what they are already familiar with on single-machine frameworks.  I hope that explains the gist of what Spark is more clearly."

SQLAlchemy is pretty powerful, well maintained and has been around for a while.   If you decide to go with SQLAlchemy keep in mind that there are two layers: Core and ORM.  From SQLAlchemy website: ORMs are basically not intended for high-performance bulk inserts - this is the whole reason SQLAlchemy offers the Core in addition to the ORM as a first-class component. Thus for performance reason you may want to use Core when applicable.   I think documentation is pretty extensive, I would suggest that you spend some time beforehand reading about  relationship management and loading http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/relationships.html, http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/loading_relationships.html  For help you can go to https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sqlalchemy, questions posted there are often answered by the author Mike Bayer There is a list of recipes available here: https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/wiki/UsageRecipes  One of the things that I find lacking from SQLAlchemy is out-of-box support for master-slave set up with read-write master and few read-only replicas, although there is a recipe to emulate Django style routing http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2012/01/11/django-style-database-routers-in-sqlalchemy/  There is also Django ORM, don't have much experience with it to share."
Python,39ir7y,Eidbanger,4,Fri Jun 12 00:21:23 2015 UTC,"It may or may not exist, but here's how I would do it. First, let's divide the problem into smaller tasks and tackle those tasks separately.  Our input is a movie file; our output is the same movie file, but with added rating metadata. The steps would be something like this:   Read the name of the movie Use the name to query Rotten Tomatoes database Read the rating from the results of the query Save the rating as metadata   This is just a rough sketch. As you write your script you may run into additional problems:   The movie files might be incorrectly named. You might know that AP.1999.720p.x264.xCATZx.mkv is a file with a critically acclaimed coming-of-age movie American Pie, but Rotten Tomatoes won't. You might need to use something like FileBot to automatically rename your movies. There is no standard format for rating metadata (or metadata as a whole) in video files. You must conform to whatever format your file library uses. This means not only the name of the tag, but also its value. Rotten Tomatoes use percentage; your library might use stars or a 0-10 scale. The good thing is, you can easily convert the values with Python.   Now, back to our main steps:   We can use Python to read the name of our neatly organized movie files. Rotten Tomatoes have an official API, so we can easily find ratings. Requests module will help us communicating with their API. Rotten Tomatoes API returns data in a JSON format. Requests can easily handle that. We can use several modules to modify metadata: enzyme and hachoir-metadata. We can also use FFmpeg."

Python,39iu1u,elbiot,2,Fri Jun 12 01:31:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, dynamic typing is a pain sometimes, though it's also pretty cool.  See, session could be a dictionary, or it could just be something that acts like a dictionary.  You don't always want that flexibility, but it is always there.  It's easy to get lost when digging deep.  I find it rare that I need to do so.  But I did once with matplotlib because I wanted to extract information users usually don't want to (I wanted the paths from the contour function, which matplotlib just plots and users almost never want to extract them).  So, I feel your frustration.  It would be harder in Django.  Ipython (or the shell) is crucial because you can test code and introspect it right there.  But Django is an exception because it requires being run as a server and so you can't really just instantiate an object in the shell and see what it does: the objects are instantiated through a complex web of server stuff.  So, towards your problem, here is my stream of consiousness:  I googled django httprequest.  I went to the second result.    session: A special read-write dictionary provided by the ​sessions middleware   So that brought me quickly to the docs for the sessions middleware  It seems there multiple engines used for saving sessions (databases, files and cookies), all of which are equivalent in that they give you a session dictionary in your view (same page).  This brought me quickly to from django.contrib.sessions.backends.base import SessionBase which I called the doc string of and could look at the source code for.  This is the special dictionary mentioned above.  The source contains this code:  def _get_new_session_key(self):     ""Returns session key that isn't being used.""     while True:         session_key = get_random_string(32, VALID_KEY_CHARS)         if not self.exists(session_key):             break     return session_key   and these lines:  session_key = property(_get_session_key) _session = property(_get_session)   Which means accessing session_key is actually getting the return value of that function call, and the _session dictionary used internally is actually the _session_cache dictionary returned by _get_session.  So, I'm not sure what you're looking for, or why.  Session_id is a unique string of 32 random valid characters, which I think is stored in a cookie, database or file depending on your settings.  What is it you want to do?  Why are you digging this deep?  Django is designed to handle this stuff for you, not to make it easy to dig into.  Maybe you would prefer Flask or something more simple/flexible/hackable?"
Python,39iu1u,TagSmile,2,Fri Jun 12 05:19:17 2015 UTC,"I was ultimately just trying to determine what could possibly be in session_key when I access it, and it was more of a general exercise so that I could use it on other things. Seems like you found it much quicker than my attempt and that probably comes with experience but it still requires a lot of steps so I was hoping there was a tool to help me figure out the possible types of values I could be given back when calling something. I suppose it just doesn't work that way in declarative languages though.  I've heard of Flask and how it's much simpler but I think ultimately I want a batteries-included web framework.  Anyway thanks for your help and detailed reply, it's very helpful and I'll hopefully not get so off course when digging in the future. Or I'll just avoid digging as nothing is so absolute in declarative languages."

Python,39g0bo,hbweb500,2,Sat Jun 13 17:03:06 2015 UTC,"This is a really cool fact about functions, which is that they are descriptors. You can read Raymond Hettinger's discussion for a good explanation.  The basic idea is this: Say you define a class Foo:  class Foo:     x = 42   When we access Foo.x, python looks in the ""class dictionary"", Foo.__dict__, for x and returns its value:  >>> Foo.x 42 >>> Foo.__dict__['x'] 42   But in fact, it isn't quite so simple. Python has these things called descriptors, which are objects implementing methods describing some special behavior that should occur whenever they are looked up as attributes of a class. One special method is __get__. Here's a sample descriptor:  class Descriptor:     def __get__(self, obj, type_):         print('I am being accessed from {}!'.format(type_))         return 42   Now if we add this descriptor to a class:  class Foo:     x = Descriptor()   and we try to access the attribute x, we find that a message is printed:  >>> Foo.x I am being accessed from <class '__main__.Foo'>! 42   It turns out that function objects in python are in fact descriptors. You can define a function and check that the resulting object has a __get__ method:  >>> def foo(): pass >>> foo.__get__ <method-wrapper '__get__' of function object at 0x1029a6b70>   Whenever this function is accessed as an attribute of a class, this __get__ method is called. As you might guess, the purpose of this method is to fill in the first argument of foo with the instance of the class it is being accessed from. And that's why no error occurs in the above example."

Python,39g0bo,hbweb500,2,Fri Jun 12 06:54:12 2015 UTC,"Perhaps a more ""philosophical"" answer is that Python's object orientation is really just a way of dealing with namespaces and functions in a ""class""-y way. You can define any function foo outside of a class definition, but if you add it to a class dictionary and call foo as a method of an instance, the instance is automagically passed as the first argument to foo. This is because functions implement the descriptor protocol, meaning that they have a __get__ method which describes the special behavior that should be invoked when the object is treated as an attribute of a class instance. In this particular case, the descriptor enforces the passing of the instance as the first argument.  For more information, I'd suggest reading Raymond Hettinger's descriptor how-to guide, which includes a bit about functions being descriptors."

At the beginning it seems repetetive to use the self, because every method you will wrote only refers to the instance, BUT later you will notice that class variable, class-methods and static-method exists, then you will need the self argument to distiguish these stuff from the instance stuff.  Here a little example:  class Test():     arg_list = [] #this variable is shared with all instances     def __init__(self, x):         self.arg_list.append(x)         self.x = x  a = Test(1) a.x >>>1 #instance variable a.arg_list # class variable >>> [1] b = Test(2) b.x >>>2 b.arg_list >>> [1, 2] c = Test(3) c.x >>>3 c.arg_list >>> [1,2,3] a.arg_list.append(""Stuff"") a.arg_list >>>[1,2,3, ""Stuff""] c.arg_list >>>[1,2,3, ""Stuff""] #all instances are sharing the same variable   Sometimes you also want to write helper methods in your class that don't need to work with your instance, then you won't need to use self.

I actually prefer it to the C++ way; with self.___ I'm explicitly referencing ""the ___ attribute of the object I was called on"" and not just ""some variable named ___ (which actually turns out to be an attribute)."" It also allows you to do things like this:  def __init__(self,foo,bar):     self.foo=foo     self.bar=bar   instead of how in C you'd have to figure out two names for the same thing, or put an underscore on the end of the parameter version or something."

Basically, this tells you how complex your code is (more information about cyclomatic complexity can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity)  The area of the given element in each plot is proportional to the number of lines of that given directory / file. For the 3D graph, the height is proportional to the cyclomatic complexity of the given file.  When optimizing your source code using this given visualization, you would e.g. look for parts that have a very high ""complexity density"" (and thus appear red on the graph) and refactor them in order to make the code easier to understand / maintain. You could also watch out for very large files and split them up into smaller, more manageable chunks.

You can then load the modules in python by writing import xlrd or whatever module you want to use.  Follow a tutorial like http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ or the book I linked.

Python,39hebj,Articulated-rage,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:03:55 2015 UTC,"With CS and programming,  the importance of structured plans is huge.  I often write out in a notebook the structure of a project many times before  I write code.  It helps as an outline for later steps,  but also helps you realize which parts are modular and can be split apart.  Look into top down and bottom up design (wiki here).   Scrapy was suggested.  It's good for getting structured data from unstructured sources, like your log info.  Then,  you want to manipulate it.  Finally,  you want to put it into a spreadsheet.  Additionally,  you want this to have an automated periodic run throughout the day.  Those  are all top level pieces.  :)   Hope that helps.  Good luck."
Python,39hebj,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:06:16 2015 UTC,"Top-down and bottom-up design:       Top-down and bottom-up are both strategies of information processing and knowledge ordering, used in a variety of fields including software, humanistic and scientific theories (see systemics), and management and organization. In practice, they can be seen as a style of thinking and teaching.  A top-down approach (also known as stepwise design and in some cases used as a synonym of decomposition) is essentially the breaking down of a system to gain insight into its compositional sub-systems. In a top-down approach an overview of the system is formulated, specifying but not detailing any first-level subsystems. Each subsystem is then refined in yet greater detail, sometimes in many additional subsystem levels, until the entire specification is reduced to base elements. A top-down model is often specified with the assistance of ""black boxes"", these make it easier to manipulate. However, black boxes may fail to elucidate elementary mechanisms or be detailed enough to realistically validate the model. Top down approach starts with the big picture. It breaks down from there into smaller segments.   A bottom-up approach is the piecing together of systems to give rise to more complex systems, thus making the original systems sub-systems of the emergent system. Bottom-up processing is a type of information processing based on incoming data from the environment to form a perception. From a Cognitive Psychology perspective, information enters the eyes in one direction (sensory input, or the ""bottom""), and is then turned into an image by the brain that can be interpreted and recognized as a perception (output that is ""built up"" from processing to final cognition). In a bottom-up approach the individual base elements of the system are first specified in great detail. These elements are then linked together to form larger subsystems, which then in turn are linked, sometimes in many levels, until a complete top-level system is formed. This strategy often resembles a ""seed"" model, whereby the beginnings are small but eventually grow in complexity and completeness. However, ""organic strategies"" may result in a tangle of elements and subsystems, developed in isolation and subject to local optimization as opposed to meeting a global purpose.

Python,39hebj,ggrieves,2,Thu Jun 11 20:30:00 2015 UTC,"No. Start with the basics.    You say that you want to get info from a website. It is unclear to me whether that website is your own (and your boss wants you to get info from the logs that are generated on the server) or if the website is online somewhere (and you need to get info from that website). Which is it? If it's the former, determine what format the logs are in. Think about how you could read that information using a script. If it's a standard format, there's probably a library for it. Also think about what information you want to get, and think of a step by step way to get it. E.g. ""the information is in the third column of every row, so I need to read in all the rows and for each row get the data from the third cell"". If it's the latter, then go to the website in your browser and click File > Save as. Save it in your project folder. Open the file in a text editor and check out its structure. What parts would you like to extract from the page? Check out this page and look around for some other tutorials on how to use the package. Write a script that can read in the data and print the first data point to the screen. Build from there. When you know how to print the relevant data to the screen, you can move on to store all the data in a useful way. Think about how you can structure the information that you're acquiring.   This might be superfluous, but don't work on the only copy of the data! Just work on some copies that are representative of the data you'll encounter when your script is finished. Make sure you don't overwrite anything important.  Oh, and about the server thing: that's for when you're finished. It's possible to have the company server automatically run the script for you periodically, so that all the data is regularly updated without anyone having to think about it."

The switch-case is intended as a special case of this scenario where the choices are all known at compile time and can therefore be implemented more efficiently.  So long story short: I think it makes sense for python (and really all languages) not to have this-- unless it is considered easier to read/type than a chain of if-else-ifs or its fall through behavior is actually needed/desired."
Python,3970zf,Oxc0ffea,2,Wed Jun 10 17:48:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think it makes sense to say that you'd stop at the most general representation without considering adding further features for convenience or structure. That argument would basically support making all structure into conditional gotos and labels. We know that is sufficient, but in practice we benefit from a more structured approach. And so it is with switch/case over if/else - switch is usually about making precisely one choice over one variable and usually it is an exclusive choice. You don't have to worry about the order of the choices or ensuring consistency across the conditionals, and in some languages a switch statement is a good way to ensure that all possible values are being handled (though that's of marginal use in a language that shunned any kind of enums for many years)."

Python,3970zf,AustinCorgiBart,11,Tue Jun 9 20:59:12 2015 UTC,"Well, in some senses that is true, it's a little inaccurate. A switch statement is usually going to turn into a jump table, which can be much faster than evaluating a chain of if-elseif-else (that's a highly language and implementation and platform dependent statement, of course). That said, a switch statement is, semantically, a more specialized form of decision than an if. A switch specifically maps a variable to a set of values, as opposed to the more generalized conditions that an if allows. I mean, technically, you can implement a for-loop with a while-loop; why do we have for-loops in addition to while loops? Because its a useful specialization that shows up enough that we want it.

Python,392unr,Rainymood_XI,7,Wed Jun 10 16:01:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't spend much time analyzing the logic, but at a more cursory level it looks quite good.  I noted just a couple little things.  data = {     ""realm_slug"": char.realm.slug,     ""char_name"": char.name,     ""region"": char.realm.region }   You're allowed to put a comma after char.realm.region too. This is quite useful because later, if you add another item to the dict, you won't need to worry about remembering to add the comma after char.realm.region. It makes life a tiny bit simpler: Just always leave trailing commas at the end of each line in a dict/list/etc., and you'll never have a crash due to a forgotten comma. No special cases.. the last item is the same as the other items, with respect to commas.  except Exception:     print(""Could not submit character data to http://wow-gm-track.website/api/add_char"")   except Exception is a little redundant; it's basically the same as just except. It's also a little over-zealous to catch all possible exceptions, so if you do so, you should at least do except Exception as foo and include some info from the exception in the error message, like:  except Exception as e:     print(""Could not submit character data to http://wow-gm-track.website/api/add_char: "" + repr(e))   unfortunately, using repr or str to format an exception can sometimes not give enough useful info, for example a socket.error just prints as error('timed out',). I wish there was a simple way to get an unambiguous string representation of an exception but I always end up with a few lines of ugly logic to do so."

Without going into a lot of detail, it's basically a low-level toolkit for building large desktop apps on the web. Think something like an IDE where you have lots of user-provided dynamic plugins, dockable and resizable panels, etc. It has its own layout engine which allows you to have layouts which just aren't possible in CSS alone (run the DockArea example to see what I mean).   It's also designed to play nicely with the rest of the web world, so if you want to host your content inside a Phosphor panel, you can. There's also some other things in there like an efficient virtual dom implementation and a lightweight dependency injection container.  Basically, my day job is architecting a large pluggable IDE-like application which needs to run in a browser. There was nothing in the JS-world which suited my needs for that, so I wrote Phosphor."

Unfortunately, it doesn't look like anyone else has joined in to pitch in with developing it further like with other projects such as pandas.  IIRC, the primary developer used to work at Enthought where Enaml originally started, but he left Enthought later on and forked it and has done a lot more work on it since.

If the value is above THRESHOLD, it's on topic. I'm curious whether this approach is effective... Anyone know this area better that could criticize or make a suggestion?

In a lot of computer science class, you write pseudo-code in your native language.    But we're already teaching maths, physics, and chemistry before children have learned English (or Latin). And all of those subjects use the same symbols to represent variables and constants no matter the language. v is velocity, F is force, and t is time in English, German [1], Dutch, Russian, or Chinese - and yet all those languages have their own words for these variables. The latter two languages don't even use the Latin alphabet. Likewise, Greek symbols are widely used in maths. Similarly, symbols for chemical elements are also uniform across different languages.  This doesn't stop their understanding, because the explanation of concepts is still carried out in their native language. Localizing everything would only slow them down and create confusion rather than introduce clarity.  If children can handle F, log, β, and H2O, they will handle if, else, and while.  Also, some languages don't have the concept of semicolons or brackets. Should we translate those as well?  [1] - they also use K for force, but they do so rarely and more commonly in older texts."

Python,390cre,AlSweigart,2,Tue Jun 9 04:01:57 2015 UTC,"We already have a programming language (sort of) where function names are translated to the locale of the editor: Excel. In my opinion it creates more problems than solutions. While I can open a spreadsheet from French Excel in the Swedish version and it will work just fine, I can't copy particular formulas between them. Not to mention troubleshooting is severely limited.  It's quite telling that the creators of Ruby and Python used English as the base of their syntax, instead of Japanese and Dutch. And that comments in Linux kernel aren't written in Finnish.  Error messages, yes - that's definitely a problem. What would be the solution though? Error codes entirely in numbers? Wouldn't that just add another layer of abstraction? Translating errors on fly? Noble idea, but it's difficult to implement. It would mean a significant rewrite of the code and it would likely break backward compatibility.  Even in Rust, a programming language which is developed as we speak, error messages are hardcoded (in English of course). That's the sad reality - internationalization is more often than not an afterthought."
Python,390cre,michaelkepler,2,Tue Jun 9 11:44:25 2015 UTC,"That's the sad reality - internationalization is more often than not an afterthought.   I agree that these problems exist, but I think they are problems to be solved rather than just get used to. I think there should be a push for internationalization to have a bigger priority than it does.  The practical reality is that English is the dominant language in coding, but there are standard practices for I18N that already exist to mitigate them:  Error messages - Use string tables. Something like this:  assert False, ""An error has happened.""   ...to this:  assert False, _(""An error has happened."")   Where _() is a common function name for fetching the translation from a string table.  It wouldn't even break code like this:  try:     5 / 0 except Exception as e:     if 'division by zero' in str(e):         print(_('blah blah blah'))   ...since it's doing comparison's between two English strings. It might break other code that uses hard-coded strings for introspection, but this is kind of a code smell anyway since it causes breaks if the code is refactored.  Comments - Tricky, since comments are casually written and re-written. But maybe just have some format that runs them through Google Translate. It would change this:  print(_('Hello')) # This is a comment.   ...to this:  print(_('Hello')) # This is a comment. {{Este es un comentario.}}   Anyway, this is all back-of-the-envelope (heh, talking about translation makes me aware of my idioms) but I18N is like writing documentation; it's not a hard technical problem so much as it just requires motivation. Right now there's a huge segment of potential programmers that are implicitly (and unnecessarily) excluded. I18N is good for the same reason open source is good: more contributors means more and higher quality software."

How could a Chinese programmer have understood code where functions, variables, classes, and comments were written in Arabic (and from right to left)? Should we not bother at all and divide the programming community by natural languages even more so? Should we teach the Chinese programmer Arabic? What if the Chinese programmer finds a GitHub project and the code is written entirely in French? Who is going to pay for those language lessons? And it's not just about money; opportunity cost tells us that in the same time instead of learning French or Arabic one could learn another programming language or a new JavaScript framework.  I suppose we could start them in native language and then switch teaching materials to English, say in high school or college. But old habits die slow. Look how many people still use print Hello World in Python 3 (or even printf), just because they were used to it since they've started coding."

There are over five BILLION people in the world who do not speak English, and never will. There are parts of the world where the lingua franca of diplomacy, science and trade is Chinese, Hindi, Arabic, French, Spanish, not English.

And if some coding is involved, then Chinese programmers will have interest in collaborating with Arabic software, even if it's just reading the API documentation.

There is no doubt that there is a cost to polyglot science (including computer science and programming). But when you shift to a monoglot science, (1) you don't remove that cost, you just shift it entirely into the part of the world that doesn't speak English, (2) you decrease if not remove entirely the possible insights that come from communication using non-English idioms, analogies and concepts, and (3) English speakers miss out on the benefits of being polyglot.  (The same applies to any monoglot system, it is not specific to English.)  Strength in diversity. To use an analogy, a computing ecosystem where everyone uses a single operating system is not as healthy as a rich ecosystem with three or four different OSes competing. Or a world where the only programming language was Java.  Anyway, English may have dominated science and technology since the 1970s, but there are signs that this is coming to an end.

Python,390cre,michaelkepler,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:49:44 2015 UTC,"Good points. However:   The domination of science and mathematics by English is a real problem for the 70% of the world that doesn't speak English, and although we lazy English speakers like to think that the world revolves around us, it's a problem for us too.   I have a feeling we're focusing on different problems. I 'm talking about using a small set of common symbols and nomenclature across the whole discipline. For example in chemistry, the same notation is used to represent chemical elements regardless of their full name in different languages. The number of ions is always represented as superscript while the number of particular atoms is in subscript. The molecular structure of organic compounds is represented with the skeletal shorthand using straight lines. All of that notation is used no matter the language of a scientific journal or a textbook.  Do you really think that this is a problem for the 70% of the world? I don't think it is. These basic rules are governed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. Turns out, they have members from many countries, including those where English is not spoken.  So, to be clear, my question is: if chemists all over the world can find some common ground, why can't programmers?  By the way, the numeral system we use internationally is not English at all. It's actually Hindu-Arabic. Don't you think it's better to use a single numeral system rather that have dozens of different ones?   you don't remove that cost, you just shift it entirely into the part of the world that doesn't speak English   The cost is always shifted into the part of the world that doesn't speak <insert language>. The problem is, this cost is multiplied each time we have to communicate in yet another language. In monoglot environments the initial costs might be higher, but in the long run savings justify the monoglot choice.   you decrease if not remove entirely the possible insights that come from communication using non-English idioms, analogies and concepts   You also introduce the possible misunderstandings and confusion when thoughts are lost in translation. Now you have to spend additional resources to clarify the situation.   To use an analogy, a computing ecosystem where everyone uses a single operating system is not as healthy as a rich ecosystem with three or four different OSes competing. Or a world where the only programming language was Java.   To continue your analogy, at the very bottom computing uses the universal binary system. Why human (programmers) can't have something similar?   Russia's space program is done in Russian, and you better believe that China's space program is not done in English.   On the other hand, the two official languages of The European Space Agency are English and French. But only less than one-third of the population of the ESA member states speak those two languages. And out those two languages English dominates internally in almost all facilities, except at the spaceport in French Guiana.  Not to mention, English is de facto the official language in international civil aviation, despite being only a recommendation.   There's a Brazilian Stackoverflow site   ...where the code still has English syntax   and ChinesePython has been around for years   ...which is a fork of Python 2.1.3 (thirteen years behind the current version), its standard library is still in English, and I can't run the ChinesePython code in the original Python 2.1.3. Now, I understand it's just for the educational purposes. But if there's a demand for programming completely in native (natural) languages, shouldn't that project gain more traction by now?  If I were to design a programming language for learning purposes, I'd do away with words and go with the code represented by symbols/flowcharts. Something like electrical circuit symbols that would be accessible regardless of the native language of the learner (including kids). What do you think?"

When something can be done securely it should be. But it is as important not to lull oneself or other in a false sense of security.  There is no such thing as perfect security. You should think about the different attack vectors and what you can do prevent them. If you don't, you won't know the possible vulnerability your system still has.  You further have to weight your security concerns against the features you want to have.  For example you can choose to build a system which authenticates without user interaction OR you can build a system which prevents other people with access to your computer from authenticating them self.  Your security can furthermore only be as good as the weakest link. If you send your secretes over an unencrypted public connection, anyone in between will be able to read and modify the data stream.

IN POINT OF FACT, Mac OS and Linux people have AT LEAST MADE A DECISION not to use the most common operating system, in the same way that people who don't use Times New Roman in all their documents have made a typographic decision. It may not be the best possible decision, but at least it's something other than going with the default. This at least weeds out some of the dumb people, because one of the characteristics of dumb people is that they don't make choices, they just go along with the majority. There are reasons to go along with the majority other than being dumb, but any majority includes a number of people who belong to it just because it's the majority. That drags down the average level of intelligence. But, then, the average measure of any quality in a group is not a fair predictor of the measure of that quality in any individual member.   It's just not part of their philosophy to bundle open source software. That's it.   Bullshit. The part of the assertion that's bullshit is the ""just."" And that ""That's it."" There's no ""just"" about it. It's not random; it's motivated. Saying ""just"" in that sentence obscures the fact that it's motivated by making it seem whimsical. It's not whimsical; it's a conscious decision that makes life harder for Windows users but benefits Microsoft. For reasons (b) and (c), which I talked about before.   No one is stupid.   Wrong. Lots of people are stupid. It's just that that particular characteristic doesn't map neatly onto operating-system choice. There are stupid people using every operating system imaginable. Microsoft, however, has made the decision to market explicitly to stupid people, and to design their operating system so that stupid people don't have trouble using it."

People assume that Windows is ""how a computer is supposed to work"" explicitly because most or all of the computers that they've previously encountered have worked that way, because most or all of the computers they've previously encountered have used Windows.

Python,3916kb,wswld,3,Mon Jun 8 14:29:00 2015 UTC,"Q1) I don't understand the question. Translation issue? I can't tell if your code works , but generally you probably want to process the input and then build the dict, rather than remove stuff with magic __delitem__.  Q2) Did not check the regex but:  def check1(login):     ret = False     if re.match('^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\-\.]{0,19}(?<![\-\.])$', login):         ret = True     return ret   Would likeky be written as:  def check1(login):     return re.match('^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\-\.]{0,19}(?<![\-\.])$', login)   This will give you None or matchobject on fail or sucess, which you can treat as if they were true or false: if check1(x): print ('valid user')  And because this regex is known and unchanging, you can compile it first with re.compile.  The logic for Q2 method 2 is quite confusing and could be simplfied. You also might want to line break that to make it readable (generally 100 chars or under; PEP8 requires 80 but PEP8's 80 limit can go suck a cock).  there's a pattern you may want to use. Rather than carrying return values through the function, just quit early on a failed check. This way you clearly separate each part of the logic and your code terminates quicker.  if a < 1 or a > 20:     return False if not a[0].isalpha():     return False for a in login[1:-1]:     if not (whatevet):         return False ... etc return True   BTW this:  if len(login)>=1 or len(login)<=20:   Does it work? I think you wanted:  if len(login) >= 1 and len(login) <= 20:   But it would be better to write  if 1 <= len(login) <= 20:   I am not sure how they want you to 'compare' the different login functions.  Ideally a login function would operate in constant time. Otherwise people can break them with timing attacks, by measuring the time taken to login with different inputs and inferring something about the algorithms used. You should really use the one provided by a framework here (or get it checked by security/crypto). This isn't the sort of code a junior should be implementing.  If someone asked me (as a junior) to 'compare' these I would write tests to make sure they both worked and put in comment that it needs security audit.  TBH there's no right or wrong way to do this.  Q3) I don't know SQL.  Q4) In bash there is tail that gives the last N entries. In Python anytiem you want to count things and find the most common then from collections import Counter.  They don't say how long the log file is. If it doesn't fit in memory the problem becomes harder. You'd think they might, but a big web company like Yandex can generate a crapload of data.

I wouldn't get a chance to  make some snarky comments as I was rejected for the job, but I wanted to hear some feedback on this test, so thank you for that.  Q1. Well, the question is to basically squash two lists so that for every key from the first list there is a corresponding value from the second. If there is no value, the key should equal None. If there is no key for the value, the value should be omitted. I know I could combine zip and map and my solution wouldn't rely on magic, however I wanted it to be really short (I don't know why, actually).  Q2. I don't think they wanted me to implement actual login functions (with all the security precautions), but yeah, with Yandex you never know. By comparison I understood time difference, but again, it sounds ambiguous even in Russian. And yeah, the following isn't right:  if len(login)>=1 or len(login)<=20:   Thank you for your correction.

So once you install and understand MINGW (which is super simple)  you configure distutils to point to MINGW. This check list that I stole explains it pretty well: 1.I have Python already installed 2. I installed mingw32 to C:\programs\mingw\ 3.Add mingw32's bin directory to your environment variable: append c:\programs\MinGW\bin; to the PATH 4.(create if not existing) distutils.cfg file located at C:\PythonXX\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg to be:  [build] compiler=mingw32  Your mileage my vary."

If it's not ASCII, I punt the burden to the user or whoever is localizing our software.  It's not my job to guess at your encoding and it's not my right to change it just because.

Python,390pwi,billsil,3,Mon Jun 8 21:23:43 2015 UTC,"I said there is no good reason to create new files using anything but UTF-8. (Actually, that's a bit strong, see below.) I didn't say that you should be forced to read existing files which you know are in some legacy encoding as UTF-8. That would be idiotic and of course it will fail.  If you are writing files that have to interact with an old legacy system which doesn't understand anything but ISO-8859-16, CP-1256, or some equally obsolete encoding, I guess that counts as a good reason for writing files in a legacy encoding. Such old legacy systems will eventually be retired or replaced, and if the replacement uses anything but UTF-8, then (generic) you really is part of the problem.  I don't have any idea what you mean by saying its not your right to change the encoding. It's your file, even if it came from me. You can delete it, modify it, encrypt it, compress it, replace every ""a"" with ""z"", or change the encoding.  As for doing the conversion wrong, it's not hard. The hard part is reading the file in the correct encoding, if you can do that, you can write it out again in UTF-8:  with open(""input.txt"", encoding=""legacy"") as infile:    with open(""output.txt"", ""w"", encoding=""utf-8"") as outfile:        outfile.write(infile.read())   Yes, I'm aware that for some of the trickier encodings that may not be supported 100% correctly by Python (some of the JIS variants?) things aren't that simple, but if you're currently reading the files with no problems, then you can write them to UTF-8 with no problem. Unicode is a superset of all the known legacy encodings, so there are no characters you are going to come across that cannot be converted to Unicode.   If there were, you wouldn't be able to read the documents in Python as Unicode strings in the first place! Not correctly, at least. You can use Latin-1 to paper over the errors and pretend that they don't exist, but the file will contain something like ""СССР"" and you'll read it as ""ÑÑÑÐ"" instead. (Hint: the actual string is Russian.)"

Since i'm not the only to implement OAuth for Yahoo API, i just made the implementation to help the others. Knowing that in our beautiful Python language, we like defining one way to do things. That's why the project is on Github.  Thus if someone finds lacks to this library, he will fill them.  I remember having a hard time finding how to implement OAuth for Yahoo with Python. No module was available on the Python Package Index anyway. I managed to implement OAuth for Yahoo, and it works.

Python,38ui0j,i_accidently_reddit,3,Sat Jun 6 22:57:33 2015 UTC,"but every value>1474 brings a OverflowError 34, results too large.   phi1475 is larger than the largest possible double precision floating point number, which is why it explodes when you try to calculate too large a value.   first of all i dont quite understand why the three vs form a matrix.   The matrix is symmetric, which means the top right and bottom left element have the same value. Since they have the same value, you only need to store one copy of it.   then im sort of lost why the iteration over the binary code works.   The algorithm is performing exponentiation by squaring. The binary string stuff is to implement Montgomery's ladder technique. It's not necessarily the most optimal way of doing it, the naive exponentiation by squaring algorithm is faster, (but vulnerable to side channel attacks, which is what Montgomery's technique is designed to avoid) but whatever.  For an inductive proof of why that the nth power of that matrix gives you the nth Fibonacci number, watch this video. You only need to watch about five minutes of it. The few minutes before the timestamp I linked explains some other reasons why the construction using the golden ratio is bad. Basically it's because since you're dealing with floating point numbers, you're really only talking about an approximation, and by the time you have a large enough arbitrary precision floating point representation of the golden ratio, all your assumptions about runtime goes out the window because multiplication of large numbers isn't O(1) anymore.

Python,38ui0j,finsternacht,2,Sun Jun 7 05:26:48 2015 UTC,"If you want to calculate a lot of consecutive Fibonacci numbers it would be better to just take the basic iterative approach and make a generator out of it like /u/K900_ suggested:  def fib_gen(count):     yield 0     yield 1     a, b = 0, 1     i = 2     while i<count:         a, b = b, a+b         yield b         i += 1   That way you calculate n consecutive Fibonacci numbers in O(n) instead of O(n log n) as you would using the matrix exponentiation method. (which is a lot better if you only want the n-th fibonacci number instead)"
Python,38ui0j,uncombed_coconut,2,Sun Jun 7 11:52:46 2015 UTC,"There are two tricks going on here.  The first is exponentiating the matrix with the repeated squaring algorithm, which is where the binary iteration comes from. A more direct translation might look like this:  from numpy import matrix      def fib(n):   base = matrix('1 1; 1 0')   power = base.copy()   for rec in bin(n)[3:]:  # perform fast exponentiation of the matrix (quickly raise it to the nth power)       power *= power       if rec=='1':    power *= base   return power[0,1]   The second trick is to use some simpler arithmetic instead of a matrix class (which is kind of overkill). The original Fibonacci matrix is symmetric, and its powers will be too, so you can represent them with 3 numbers. Then we just figure out how to represent the squaring and *base operations:  [v1 v2][v1 v2] = [v1^2+v2^2 v2v1+v2v3] [v2 v3][v2 v3]   [v2v1+v2v3 v2^2+v3^2]  [v1 v2][1 1] = [v1+v2 v1] [v2 v3][1 0]   [v1    v2]   BTW, the closed form solution didn't work out because you're asking Python to do floating point math.

Python,38osar,atdk,17,Fri Jun 5 16:38:07 2015 UTC,"Let me emphasize that both are extremely good choices. The difference is rooted mainly in their different philosophies and design.  Flask is a micro-framework. It basically gives you a router and a small debug webserver, based on werkzeug. All the rest would have to be implemented through plugins, other 3rd party packages and manual coding.  On the other hand, Django brings more to the table, notably an ORM. You can then use Django Rest Framework to expose the models through a REST API. Note that the ORM is extremely oriented towards SQL databases though.  So in the end, my advice is: if you can use all of what Django brings you, you're probably using it. However in your case, as you're using mongoDB, and Django is kind of an SQL-only-framework, I think it's safer to use Flask, and will be easier to integrate with it. I emphasized ""easier"", because you can use Django with mongo, it's just more work.    My 0.02$"

As a guy whose day job consists of working on a Django site with a Mongo backend, I'll confirm that it is far more work than its worth. Unless you use `mongoengine, you've basically got to cripple Django to the point where most of its Django-y goodness is lost.   Now, you can get back a lot of that Django-y goodness by using mongoengine, but it is veeeeeeeery far from production ready. If there are bugs in your library code all of development becomes harder. You'll never know how far down in the stack you need to look when an issue pop up. Last week I spent hours and hours debugging what ended up being an update issue inside of mongoengine that was filling our db with partially populated records.

I think you'll find if you build an API in Flask, you'll gradually add in things you need and you'll develop an understanding of how the system fits together.

However, most client drivers have a safe write, and probably many of them are enabled by default.  However, server side, writes are still async, and that can't be changed.  I believe the flush from journal to disk is every 100ms, so you could still have something go very wrong and lose up to that 100ms of writes.  And for the financial sector, that could be fatal.  And if your journal some how ends up corrupted, and you can replay it for whatever reason, you could lose up to 60 seconds of data.

While the setup needs more time and thought put in, relational databases outperform document databases massively, and provide far greater data integrity as well, and should generally always be a serious consideration.

Also I did not notice anything specific to implementing REST APIs other than routing via decorators & automatic parameter passing based on URL templates. Features also found in Tornado.  One thing that I like about flask is that I find compelling about flask is the ability to specify parameter type in URL. In Tornado, the routes are just regexes, so you'd have to use [named] groups (IIRC it's the same in Django).  As for the things that I like in Tornado more is reasonable support for async I/O, clear main loop handling and built-in WebSocket support."

Wrote several production apps in   Flask/Mongo/Mongoengine/Flask-Restful,  Django/Postgres/Django ORM/Django Rest Framework.   What I don't like in Flask Fragmented packages (i.e. hard to setup/customize) Fragmented documentation (*not clear in many cases how to use) You will end up re-inventing the wheel, as it's micro-framework. What I don't like in mongoengine When you need sophisticated (behind simple CRUDs) uses cases it becomes buggy and you have to debug in order to understand where the problem is No support for aggregation framework, just pure CRUD Cluttered documentation Slow ""community"". IRC is atrocious at best.  It relies on FKs to be ObjectId, therefore integrating with let's say with other libs/languages in future (microservices) would become much more problematic, if they treat FKs as simple strings instead of objectId Slow. I mean REALLY VERY SLOW especially to process data in foreach cycles. I had to switch to raw pymongo to process some of the data flow (27 sec in mongoengine vs 1.7 sec in pymongo for the same operation)   I do like their ""cache field type"" - it allows to implement less reads among collections   Flask-restful is just fine but compared to Django Rest Framework I have to write 10 times less code, therefore my productivity is WAY HIGHER with Django/DRF/Postgres/Django ORM than with Flask/Flask-Restful/Mongo/Mongoengine. What I don't like in DRF Hard to customize responses, it's always in  { ""field"": [errors] ""non-field-errors"": [] }   and usually with 400 http code back.   However DRF is GREAT with serializers/validators/custom permissions and has deep integration with Django  Code in DRF is much easier to read (in most cases it's convention over customization), grab model, define serializer, define validators, permissions. All methods get/put/post etc are very short. Code is MUCH MUCH easier to maintain compared to code written in Flask.   Mongo   I love MONGO. Especially the aggregation framework. And for finacial apps - aggregation framework may bring TONS of value. No migrations, scaling is easy (although there are some issues with sharding), I get much less collections compared to amount of tables in similar SQL solution. However - if your nature is ""TRANSACTIONS"", I would rethink use of Mongodb  Pymongo - is GREAT. Mongo MMS is great to deploy clusters on AWS in minutes and monitor.  However if nature of your app is ""RELATIONAL"" - then Mongo would become your liability and nightmare. You will end up making SQL-like solution in NoSQL terms and you will gain nothing, just additional headaches.   If your app is ""document"" oriented, where a lot of information can be persisted within a single collection - then Mongo is FANTASTIC. You need to get used to querying the data (it's not intuitive when you start to use various modifiers), but it's not an obstacle.   I absolutely WOULD NOT recommend to use mongoengine for production-complex-apps. Very annoyed with a lot of things.    I would use flask/flask-restful as a micro-service and left authentication service written in something else. Flask app then just get authorization token (or public API endpoints). I.e. I would do as little customization to flask / flask-restful as possible - then it would be a good solution. As soon as you see that you need this and this and that in Flask, that is not available out of the box - revise your decision to use Flask (or drop the requirements) A lot of beauties is available in Django/DRF - batteries included! Middlewares etc. They don't exist in Flask.    So my opinion is Django/Postgres vs Flask/Mongo is 10:1 towards Django. Less code, features delivered faster, documentation is no-issue.   I would not go into Django/Mongo as Django is all about postgres :)"

You can imagine that at some point during that year, the network of scripts calling other scripts, cron jobs, location of log files and managing failure and retry would become unruly.   Now think of a data team of dozens (or hundreds!) of data engineers, data scientists and data analysts trying to work together and produce analytics. Airflow solves that problem. These guys can use Airflow and stay sane.

One of the first things you learn in writing these processes is that they can't be quickly slapped-together ""scripts"", regardless of the language used.   I find that Python works great in these cases - but the tasks should be well-tested, somewhat bulletproof.  And if you have 10,000 tasks with many interdependencies - it's unmanageable.  It takes constant refactoring & grooming to keep a system like this simple.  And if you invest in a high-performance, well-curated adhoc-friendly data store, then you can eliminate an enormous amount of redundant tasks, producing redundant (but seldom consistent) data - and replace them with much smaller queries against that consistent data store.    Between the above two strategies you can reduce 10,000 tasks down to 50 - which is a totally different kind of problem.  And doesn't typically need a huge, or complex framework."

How many tasks or unit of work is it reasonable for them to build grow and maintain? 50? 10k? 100k? What's a task, what is a unit of work? How many is too many?  Well with Airflow you can define all of these things, and since it is programmatic and scripts can be templated, there can be as much code re-use and leveraging of libraries as one want to do.  Having too few big jobs is risky, bringing problems like the unit of work is too big, and failure means lost workload, single points of failure, and change has to be managed centrally and consensus seeking becomes hard/impossible. Too many small fragmented tasks and there's a lot of effort and data duplication, but people can move fast and there aren't important single points of failure.

How many is too many?   I've been building these solutions for 20 years, and what I've found is that redundant processes will seldom result in identical results.   And analytical processes are very vulnerable to data quality problems.   So this is a huge problem.  The reason why you might have 10,000 tasks is usually that engineers are developing the same things in parallel.   Redundant silos.   While a little competition is good, and a little decentralization is helpful, you really don't want 200 processes written by 10 different people all building the same aggregation from the same base data.  They won't match, you'll get inconsistent results.  It's just a lot of hand-waving and energy, all for fairly little results of dubious quality.  Consolidating & reusing the output of a process doesn't mean the jobs are bigger.  And they're not more failure-prone.  If anything they're less since you can focus a little more effort to get one working really well vs 200 working quick & dirty.   And the opposite, having many small processes doesn't mean avoiding single-points of failure.  There's plenty of single points of failure - they're just used by fewer systems each, so the frequency of failure is higher, but the impact is lower."

There's definitely a need for a single source of truth, a core team managing core datasets in the warehouse, and clarity/namespaces around areas that are certitified/SLA/data quality checks, .... There's also a need for people (data scientists, analysts, software engineers) to have sandboxes where they can analyze data and sometimes schedule jobs to say curate training datasets for machine learning, create aggregates for a dashboard, scout on newly instrumented tokens...  A new trend I've seen emerged while working at Facebook was ""analytics as a service"" or ""data science infrastructure"" which often means that data pipelines get built dynamically. Think of an config-driven ""aggregation framework"", ""anomaly detection framework"", ""cohort analysis framework"" where data workers can plug in datasets (through a config file or a UI) set up a few parameters, and pipelines get generated for them dynamically. Airflow can power such frameworks, and the number of tasks generated dynamically can seem overwhelming at first, though they are really just different instances of the same pipeline.  When I threw the number 10k out there, it doesn't mean 10k shitty shell scripts written by people who don't know what they are doing, I meant 10k useful nodes in graphs of dependencies. It includes data ingestion / staging jobs, sensors that wait for external partitions to land, many HQL scripts, data quality checks, triggers for reports (Tableau) to be refreshed,  an entire experimentation framework where the unit of work is an experiment, things that feed back into powering the production website, a stats collection framework that build database statistics off of Hive where the unit of work is a partition. All of these task need to run on a schedule, in the right order, need to retry when they fail, send email alerts when they fail, ... It's a large complex orchestrated ballet that takes place and succeeds every day. This is what Airflow does.  I don't now what kind of data environment you work in, but ""big data"" (as much as I hate using this term) is moving in the direction I'm describing, and tools like Airflow (as part of a much more complex stack) empowers big data teams to perform modern analytics.

Python,38mbej,ies7,3,Sat Jun 6 14:42:41 2015 UTC,"This kind of stuff is used all the time in visual effects, mostly for managing the 'rendering' pipeline.   All any visual effects artist does is author some sort of description for the location and color of 3D geometry, cameras, volumes like smoke, lights, and other things. ""Rendering"" is the process of taking those descriptions and actually turning them into images. It can be extremely resource intensive, and is massively parallel, so every studio uses a 'farm' of computers with a system like this managing render jobs on top.  The rendering process often has many complex dependencies. For example, shadows must often be calculated before the final image can be created. The dependencies are predictable but, for example, the number of shadows varies for each artist and each scene. There are many other dependencies too, so doing all that management by hand becomes ridiculously slow.  Apart from rendering, all sorts of other jobs need to be run to get assets through the pipeline, and many of those can be run through the same framework. Even if they aren't parallel tasks, running them remotely frees up the artists' machine.  So very useful in that context.

Things like A/B testing frameworks where registering a new test dynamically builds tasks in a workflow, or an anomaly detection service where data scientists can plug in queries to config files or a UI and pipelines get generated dynamically for them, or an aggregation framework where aggregation jobs are generated dynamically from config files.  Luigi is built in a way that it uses Python to process the data which for us was a no-no since Python isn't the most performant language to compute through TBs of data.

You'll get something similar to the following printed to your console: <generator object <genexpr> at 0x0311B710> Why do we get this? It's quite simple when you think about it. x for x in range(0, 10) isn't a function. There's nothing to be executed, as the code by itself doesn't mean anything.    The code by itself does absolutely work and mean something, it defines a generator expression, and the print statement does exactly what it is supposed to do, call __str__ on the object, which in this case results in a description of what this object is.  If you want to run the generator expression and get values you treat it like any other iterable and call next on it:  >>> g = (x for x in range(10)) >>> next(g) 0 >>> next(g) 1 >>> next(g) 2"

Python,38sm7u,zeug,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:16:21 2015 UTC,"Sure, but to unpack the generator into an argument list, one is still calling next until a StopIteration exception is raised.  One could just  do for i in g: print(i) and the for loop would call next, bind the return value to i and execute print(i) until a StopIteration exception is raised.  My point is that the tutorial is extremely misleading to say that x for x in range(0, 10) means nothing when it defines and returns a generator expression that one can iterate over in the same manner as any other iterable.  The fact that print doesn't iterate over it is just due to the fact that print doesn't iterate over an object in general. A list just happens to return a string that displays its contents when one calls __str__ on it. Given that a generator expression could be extremely expensive or not even finite, it makes sense for it to not try to exhaust itself when __str__ is called."

The feature was intentionally left vague — the annotations can be any arbitrary Python expression, they don't have to name types or have anything to do with type checking.  They are completely optional and are ignored by the language, other than being evaluated when the function is defined (i.e. if you use an expression with side effects, they will be visible.)  And that doesn't change in 3.5, where the language continues to ignore them — you can pass a float to your example function and it still works.  The point has always been to let third party tools invent their own semantics for what annotations should mean.  The only thing that's changed in 3.5 is that now the language has a suggested set of semantics to be used for type checking, but the annotations are still completely ignored by the language and you're still free to invent your own arbitrary semantics."

Python,38n12f,JKovac,3,Fri Jun 5 07:20:00 2015 UTC,"The Cython devs consistently say that Python lists are fast enough, but this hasn't been my experience developing spaCy. Like you I find that I need to put structs in arrays, instead of classes in lists.  But this limits what you can do quite a lot! Sometimes you do really want something like a class...but if you use a cdef class, then you can no longer pass it by value, or allocate it on the stack.  I've been playing with the following solution, using cppclass. This behaviour isn't documented, and there are some weirdnesses. I've been meaning to email the user list about it. If you like the idea and want something like this to get full support, maybe you can back the proposal when I do :)  The following currently works:  cdef struct _ClassData:     int foo  cdef cppclass MyClass:     _ClassData _data      MyClass()      @staticmethod     MyClass init(int foo) nogil:         _data.foo = foo      int inc(int value) nogil:         return _data.foo + value  def test(foo, value):     cdef MyClass instance = MyClass.init(foo)     print instance.inc(value)   The struct is used to house the internal state, because otherwise Cython gets confused about the scoping when you want to assign to the non-local variable. A staticmethod is used to instantiate, because Cython doesn't allow you to do stack allocation with non-default constructors.  The MyClass instance can be allocated on the stack, or allocated on the heap with the ""new"" keyword. But, I don't want to use ""new"" --- if I use the heap, I want to use my own memory pool. It sounds like Kivy has its own memory pool too. Because stack allocation is supported, we can do this:  from cymem.cymem cimport Pool mem = Pool() instance = <MyClass*>mem.alloc(1, sizeof(MyClass)) instance[0] = MyClass.init(foo)   Then we don't need to remember to delete the memory. When mem goes out of scope and is deleted, it cleans up all the memory it allocated — so managing the memory becomes just like managing memory always is in Python."
Python,38n12f,syllogism_,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:27:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing, it is good to hear others have had similar trouble with list, and classes. Kivy itself does not use any custom memory allocation, but KivEnt have an extensively custom solution really based around working around how slow holding data in classes (even cdef classes) and then putting those classes in lists is.   I have tried to keep KivEnt away from C++ implementations so far since I think it's a little more elegant/easier to grok if everything is either python or a bit of C, but your cppclass is definitely an interesting little snippet."

Python,38hchz,Rubykuby,2,Thu Jun 4 12:15:12 2015 UTC,Does it work with virtualenvwrapper the same way as 2.7?
Python,38hchz,sweet_dreams_maybe,5,Thu Jun 4 12:53:13 2015 UTC,"Yes. Here's how it works: You have to have an installation of the Python version that you wish to make a virtualenv of. In my case, I have several system installations of Python: py2.6, py2.7, py3.2, py3.3 & py3.4.  If I want a virtualenv of a py2.7 installation, I simply do:  mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 $ENV_NAME   And virtualenvwrapper will make a virtualenv of Python 2.7 for me.  This is ONLY possible if you already have an installation of Python 2.7 available. If you do not have Python 2.7 on your filesystem, you CANNOT make a virtualenv of Python 2.7."

It's basically the same as python -m venv.  Because venv doesn't exist in the Python 2 standard library, I personally use virtualenv"

Python,38f1nk,cast42,20,Wed Jun 3 20:00:18 2015 UTC,"This is a nice list.  A little clarification on #3:   3 Chained comparison operators  Because I was so used to statically typed languages (where this idiom would be ambiguous), it never occurred to me to put two operators in the same expression.   This has nothing to do with static typing. It is related to the semantics of Python, which allow for what is essentially rewriting of expressions.  So, for example a += b, when the + operator is defined, but += is not, gets executed as a = a + b.  Similarly, a < b < c is converted to something pretty much the same as a < b and b < c -- except that b is evaluated only once.  Both of the above kinds of rewrites could have been used in a statically typed language like C++. (Yes, there are reasons why it might have been a bad idea; but it would have been possible.)  And, by the way, if we really miss the C++-style semantics for chained comparisons, the we can still get them in Python by adding parentheses: (a < b) < c.[1]    [1] A note for the inexperienced: that last paragraph, while it is correct, is a bit of a joke. Yes, the semantics are as described. No, this is not what you want to do. It will result in bugs that are difficult to fix.

Python,38ee9d,keypusher,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:07:16 2015 UTC,"Code length is significant, a dozen lines at least to do __eq__ and __hash__ alone. More importantly, if you change the fields, you have to update these methods (and the constructor). If you don't, you can end up with hard-to-debug issues relating to your class's equality semantics.  namedtuple is also based on built-in tuples so it's memory efficient and presumably fast (at least for operations implemented by the base class).  So to answer your question, code size, boilerplate, DRY, and performance."
Python,38ee9d,brandjon,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:20:33 2015 UTC,"It's also more explicit, in that using namedtuple clearly expresses that the type is meant to be just a data container, without logic of its own."

I like the idea of the object not being monkeyed with once it's been initialized. I also like having the namedtuple having a minimum of fields and then adding @property to class methods that can output attribute-like values that are calculations.   Extending namedtuple wasn't too hard and I think I found a simpler way to do it rather than extending two base classes  An example would be like this:  MyBaseClass = namedtuple('MyBaseClass', [....])  class MyClass(MyBaseClass):     __slots__ = () # this is important or instances of this class can have new attributes added at any time     def __new__(cls, some_data_probably_a_dict):         return MyBaseClass.__new__(cls, **some_data_probably_a_dict)     @property     def total(self):         return sum(self.data_points)     @property     ....     # regular methods are also no problem and are declared as usual     def regular_method(self, whatever):     ....   Anyone see any problem with the approach I've taken? It seems that I get immutable classes with method inheritance, I'd like to know if there are any issues with this pattern."
