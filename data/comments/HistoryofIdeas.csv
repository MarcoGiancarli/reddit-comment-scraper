His work is noted for its merging of casual anecdotes and autobiography with serious intellectual insight; his massive volume Essais (translated literally as ""Attempts"" or ""Trials"") contains some of the most influential essays ever written.   Montaigne had a direct influence on writers all over the world, including Francis Bacon, René Descartes, Blaise Pascal, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Albert Hirschman, William Hazlitt, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Friedrich Nietzsche, Stefan Zweig, Eric Hoffer, Isaac Asimov, and possibly on the later works of William Shakespeare.   And on Montaigne's Tower:   Forty-six of its forty-eight oak joists, as well as two supporting beams, were painted with Greek and Latin citations in Montaigne’s time. (...) The two load bearing beams bear eight inscriptions from skeptic authors, mostly from Sextus Empiricus. The forty-six joists, distributed on three rows, are inscribed with a total of sixty-seven sayings taken in their majority from the Bible and from classic authors (including Horace, Lucretius, Menander, and Sophocles). Many of these are mentioned in the Essays, either verbatim, in translation, or in paraphrase.    More posts about Montaigne."

Hume argues that suicide is no more a rebellion against God than is saving the life of someone who would otherwise die, or changing the position of anything in one's surroundings. He spends much less time dismissing arguments that it is an affront to one's duty to others or to oneself. Hume claims that suicide can be compared to retiring from society and becoming a total recluse, which is not normally considered to be immoral, although the comparison would not seem to justify a suicide that leaves in its wake children or dependents who are thereby rendered vulnerable. As for duty to self, Hume takes it to be obvious that there can be times when suicide is desirable, though he also thinks it ridiculous that anyone would consider suicide unless they first considered every other option."

Locke-Hobbes, I've always understood this episode as Newton referring to Hobbes's physico-mechanical ideals, which I think is what you mean by his materialism. Just like Hobbes, Locke had issues with the existence of a pure vacuum. I'm not familiar with the melancholy passage, but as Newton hardly ever joked, I can't think of it as meant humorous. Neither did he have any book by Burton, by the way.   Was Newton a Newtonian? Now that's an extremely difficult question. There are so many definitions of Newtonianism; even in his days there was no clear-cut description. It can refer to his natural philosophy, his methodology, his theist conceptions, etc. But they were all embodied by Newton, so in that case: yes :-) Newton was definitely familiair with Eckhart and Boehme, though he did not own any of their works.

However, two of the arguments presented here are just as misleading. First, the author implies that the existence significant scientific achievements after Ghazali counters the ""Ghazali killed science"" narrative:   If Ghazali had killed science in Islam in the twelfth century, then al-Shatir's work from the fourteenth century could not have been so influential on Copernicus's work.   All this argument shows is that Ghazali could not have eradicated science in the Islamic world, which is hardly surprising: science was hardly at its peak in medieval Europe, yet medieval Europe birthed a number of important scientific discoveries. More significant would be a comparison of the relative scientific outputs of the pre- and post-Ghazali Islamic world.   The religion of Islam encourages rational and scientific inquiry. Therefore, Muslims see no insurmountable contradictions between their faith and natural laws. Hence, studying religion and studying natural sciences does not create a conflict for Muslims.   I'm not aware of many successful modern religions that discourage rational and scientific inquiry. The conflict is not a result of religion attempting to eradicate scientific inquiry, but of scientific inquiry turning its lens on the claims of religion. Islam, like every other modern religion, has had plenty of conflict with those who seek to subject its claims to rational inquiry. See, e.g., Taner Edis, An Illusion of Harmony: Science and Religion in Islam; Wikipedia: Islam and Science."
HistoryofIdeas,3bghrz,thisisadumbthrowaway,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:42:42 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely correct. In Islamic studies there is a weird topos that   First, the European paradigm of conflict between religion and science does not really apply to the Islamic world.   This is absolutely false, as in Catholic Europe there could not exist a conflict between religion and science because science, as we understand it today, did not exist at that time. Rational inquiry (=philosophy) was generally considered to be the ""handmaid of theology"", and thus most of the time was considered to be extremely useful. No theologian existed in medieval Europe who had not had extensive schooling in philosophy. Many (but of course not all) theologians considered true philosophy to be theology and true theology to be philosophy, striving for harmony between the two. When we look the arguments of Aquinas, that creation (nature) attests about God and we should study his creation as thoroughly as we study the sacred texts, then there appears no conflict at all. ""Conflict"" is usually situated during the time of reformation which happens to be also the time of the reception of the heliocentric model, but a lot has already been written about this."

This is kind of foisted on us and we sort of accept it but what happens if we were raised with lots of art, maybe trauma and what not,  and we are sort of divergent/transgressive thinkers or creative people and don't really fall into that trap so easily? What you find then is that these philosophies and approaches to living don't really have anything to say about that because they're static works of art that force you into their little box. So you have to sit there and say, okay, I'm in a kind of average everyday way of being that we all are in, sort of just stuck in have it, right, okay I'll start there and then, oh look at art, or deep thought, or authentic being, or reflection - - gee I never reflected on anything before! - - this is absolutely amazing! what an insight!

My general sense is that the job of interpretation is figure out what's going on in the books, and then leave it to the biographers to make sense of it (as opposed to letting the biographers say, well there's no identifiable external cause so he can't have changed his mind). A related historical puzzle: if Hobbes changed his mind, why did he never publicly disown De Cive, but include both in the later edition of his works in Latin? The best answer I can give is that Hobbes is known to have undergone a period of acute depression after publishing Leviathan - probably connected with the book being so poorly received by his former pupil, Charles II (then in exile in Paris). When he went back to England after that he was so beleaguered by hostile critics he may well have thought it best to leave it alone, let posterity sort it all out. (And meanwhile De Cive had attracted an admiring following among former associates in France, who didn't know Leviathan because they couldn't read English- this is all in his correspondence.)"

To be good scholars of mythologies, folklore, and belief of these periods before Christianity, and after mixing with it, we must be open and truthful that our sources are few.

They have been used in the service of brutal systems such as slavery and colonialism, been appropriated and twisted by monsters like Stalin and Hitler, and provoked reactions against the Enlightenment’s legacy by Islamic Salafists and the Christian Religious Right.

With passion and conviction, it exhorts us to recognize the central importance of these ideas as historical forces and pillars of the Western humanistic tradition. It makes the case that to read the works of the great thinkers is to gain invaluable insights into the ideas that have shaped how we think and what we believe."

His view of British aristocracy came out when he said,  ""Purge (Parliament) of its corruption and give to its popular branch equality of representation, and it would become an impracticable government: as it stands at present, with all its supposed defects, it is the most perfect government which ever existed.""   Franklin, on the other hand, had had spent years attempting conciliation, and found the institution contemptible. He summarized one session that was considering the last grasp at avoiding war:    They gave it the same consideration as they would the song of a drunken porter."

She collected over four hundred alchemical, medicinal, and cosmetic recipes, and corresponded with other alchemical adepts about materials and laboratory techniques.   Her example reflects a more general fascination with secrets that enthralled courts throughout early modern Europe, giving rise to a lively market for such information. It also offers an opportunity to explore some of the ways in which women—and men—engaged with scientific culture on the cusp of the Scientific Revolution in pursuit of health, beauty, wealth, and power.   Not only is Caterina Sforza’s experimental activity emblematic of the wider panorama of women’s involvement in early modern scientific culture, but it also situates her at the origins of a Medici interest in alchemy and experiment that stretched well into the seventeenth century."

In my earlier post on Mayan human sacrifice (http://sites.psu.edu/kerenw/?p=142), I've noted the material and political functions of human sacrifice:  ""...it is important to note that effects of this dialectical relationship between sacrificial practices and their corresponding mythos are not contained within the sphere of religious life. Collective ideas, even in the form of “religious superstitions”, do not simply emerge from thin air ad libitum; rather, they both inflect and reflect human’s social and material conditions... ...While arguing for explicit manipulative intentions on the part of Shang and Mayan rulers might run the risk of over-instrumentalizing and over-rationalizing their sacrificial practices, it is nonetheless difficult to overlook the powerful functioning of religious ritual in the maintenance of society, even without the presence of such explicit motives.""  Furthermore, I do believe that it's indispensable to consider specific examples of human sacrifice within the context of their local political economies."

HistoryofIdeas,396ffu,Qwill2,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:19:48 2015 UTC,"In the past few decades, radical fundamentalists have become a major force in the global world. Or at least that what we often here in media outlets or from politicians and religious figures. But what exactly does 'fundamentalism' mean? Does this category point to something specific and exclude phenomena that falls outside the intended use of the term?   In Fundamentalism: Perspectives on a Contested History (University of South Carolina Press, 2014) editors Simon A. Wood, Associate Professor of Religious Studies at University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and David Harrington Watt, Professor of History at Temple University, collect a broad set of essays that address just this. They investigate the origins of the term, various communities that have been classified 'fundamentalist,' and alternative trajectories for the deployment of the label. Most often 'fundamentalism' is used to designate a position that advocates a rejection of modernity, scriptural literalism, militancy, and politicization of religion. However, under further investigation the separate communities or leaders do not always comply with these positions or approaches.   Additionally, we frequently find familiar positions advocating for these standpoints without being labeled 'fundamentalist.' While not excluding other voices the editors and most of the collection's authors argue that the term 'fundamentalism' is unanchored from its American Protestant origins, obscure in its designation, and assumes religion is a separate distinct sphere of social life. Therefore, they claim it is inadequate and ineffective to employ the term as an analytical category.   In our conversation we discuss early twentieth-century conservative Protestantism, Ayatollah Khomeini, American and Israeli Judaism, Islamic Education, environmental consciousness, Salafism, Sufism, Shiism, and secular societies."

HistoryofIdeas,38jne1,Qwill2,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:43:38 2015 UTC,"David N. Levy presents Machiavelli as a political thinker for our times and a touchstone for clarifying a republican concept of liberty. Levy's reading turns the importance of class conflict in sustaining the free way of life on ""wily elites"" and ""spirited peoples"" as guardians of republican liberty. He develops this reading primarily through The Discourses on Livy, though Levy believes that The Prince contains an essentially republican political teaching.   In this way, Levy follows Quentin Skinner in seeing republican liberty as fundamental to Machiavelli's political thought. But Machiavelli's republicanism, for Levy, is precisely why we must read him ""out of context"" and against historicist methods, why we cannot permit contextualism to get in the way of a fruitful encounter with Machiavelli. Ultimately, says Levy, Skinner himself did not adhere to a strict historicism, for he too sees in Machiavelli's republicanism a significant corrective to our political way of life. Put differently, even Skinner permits Machiavelli to speak to us in a normative voice. Levy's book amplifies the republican voice in Machiavelli that speaks of class conflict and the free way of life."

As a school teacher, Ohm began his research with the new electrochemical cell, invented by Italian scientist Alessandro Volta. Using equipment of his own creation, Ohm found that there is a direct proportionality between the potential difference (voltage) applied across a conductor and the resultant electric current. This relationship is known as Ohm's law.  Martin Ohm (May 6, 1792, Erlangen – April 1, 1872, Berlin) was a German mathematician and a younger brother of physicist Georg Ohm.  Ohm was the first to fully develop the theory of the exponential ab when both a and b are complex numbers in 1823.

As for the claim that it stands alone as a resource for studying the 'germ of the new world outlook', you would have thought that they would have realized that a 'world outlook' is something Engels introduced after Marx died and not something Marx ever saw himself doing. The same with 'historical materialism', the reason that Marx never wrote a book on it is because he didn't know what it was, he never even mentioned the words! It's foolish to try to find things that were implied by Engels by interpreting Marx though Engels positivism.  The problem with the Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe (and Marxology in general) is that it is worked on mostly by social-scientists, positivist market socialists - the kind of people Marx criticized in The Poverty of Philosophy."
HistoryofIdeas,36vypq,Qwill2,2,Fri May 22 15:40:58 2015 UTC,"I wonder: how does this relate to the older Platonic focus on decay through change? Building on the Greek religion of his time, for Plato we are caused by the perfect Form of man, but are always flawed shadows of this Form. Of course, for Plato this is not restricted to man but extends to the whole sensible world: my bed is caused by the perfect Form of the bed. At this point, in the context of man, it seems like a clear precedent for Original Sin, especially given the strong historic influence of Neoplatonism on Christianity.   However, Plato inherits something further from Heraclitus: they view the world as constantly in flux and degenerating. Thus, to recast in the language of Original Sin, not only are we sinners but we are more depraved sinners than our fathers. Can we find this idea propagating to the modern day? Environmentalist views of man as an ongoing destroyer of the pristine Earth seems like a good candidate -- what would Popper have said about this?"

Judging by the conversations I have with my religious relatives and the books they give me, it takes a lot more rhetoric and explaining away to get over ideas that your average medieval peasant would not have found troubling at all. But people who live in an era of DNA, evolution, etc., have to either research these things to understand how they do or do not contradict the theology of their choice or have them explained by a person of above-average literacy -- and frankly questionable intent.   Also, we are entertaining ourselves to death, so we now entertain ourselves during time that previously was spent in religious thought, conversation or rereading the Bible.   I think these things pyramid on themselves so that what is hard pushes us toward entertainment, which is easier (and safer) to talk about with others than religion."

I have married into a family that believes every word of the Bible is literally true. That has led them to believe some things that have been overtaken by science. You can tell because they now dislike science. My in-laws believe it is irresponsible to send your children to public schools where they are exposed to things like evolution or the fact the Earth has been around for billions of years.

HistoryofIdeas,36rinz,1369ic,1 point,Fri May 22 14:45:06 2015 UTC,"What people usually mean when they say they believe the Bible ""literally"" is that they believe that when the Bible says miracles happened, it means that actual miracles actually happened. Including the miracle of the Creation. In that sense, I am a ""Biblical literalist."" I think the miracles happened.  However, many Protestant Evangelicals go far beyond this into doctrines about the Bible being absolutely infallible and all-sufficient and I do not believe those doctrines. They tend towards an absurd moral and factual relativism in which a thing is true not because it actually happened but only because the Bible says it happened. They redefine truth to mean not ""correspondence to reality"" but ""correspondence to the Bible."" Under such beliefs, it becomes circular to even say that the Bible is true. This tendency reaches it's greatest heights in the absurdity of Calvinist ""presuppositional apologetics"" and it deserves whatever insults the atheists throw at it.  I think the Bible is true because, and only because, I think the things it says happened really happened. That the gist is basically correct. A slight error in the 73rd name in a long genealogical list somewhere in the Book of Numbers wouldn't bother me too much in terms of the claim that the Bible is true.  I also distrust the public schools. I am extremely skeptical about the ability of science to give reliable answers about events very much prior to the dawn of recorded history -- about roughly as skeptical as I am about the ability of science to give reliable answers about events in remote futurity. We don't increase in certainty as we move away from the directly observable: that's where we decrease in certainty.  The idea of evolution is certainly a reasonable idea in some ways, which does need to be taught. But not as an unquestionable dogma. If we throw out the men in the black robes because we want to think for ourselves, but then we turn right around and invite in the men in the white lab coats to think for us, the only real difference in our education is going to be the wardrobe color. We still won't be thinking for ourselves.  In the case of ""evolution"" the consequences of not thinking for ourselves is particularly dire, because ""evolution"" is often presented not as the strictly biological working hypothesis it is, but as a grand cosmic narrative which explains literally everything, especially ethics and politics via the Myth of Progress. In an age where purely speculative evolutionary psychology and radically political gender studies get to count as scientific, you will have to excuse some popular skepticism about science in general."

Science can be critiqued, in fact it must be, that's how it progresses. We don't let scientists ""think for us,"" we validate their ideas based on evidence with our own rationality to arrive at the most likely explanation.  Religion is based on dogma. Evidence in religion is nothing more than ancient legacy texts of which we have no empirical means of verifying. There is nothing the individual can do to rationally critique the ideas set forth; they say what they say, and that is that. Any rational challenge to them is heresy.

Dogma is anything put forth as true that does not or can not accept a rational refutation. All religions have this in some form or it wouldn't be a religion.

The point is that without skepticism science would stagnate   What kind of skepticism do you mean? Do you mean skepticism as a personal attitude or skepticism as a philosophical system as proposed by empiricists like David Hume and later by the logical positivists?   I am not denying that our senses could very well mislead us into accepting a false reality   That's not the grounds on which I would contest empiricism. I would contest it's exclusivity. I think that, for the most part, there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophies, not less.   Dogma is anything put forth as true that does not or can not accept a rational refutation.   You mean like the fundamental laws of thought? (meaning the basic principles of classic Aristotelian logic)  The point of my question is that this isn't how I would define dogma, but even under the definition of dogma you propose, dogma is by no means exclusive to religion.   All religions have this in some form or it wouldn't be a religion.   That would itself be an a priori analytic dogma. No facts about the world could refute it because your response to my pointing out the existence of a religion which doesn't have the property you indicate would be that it isn't really a religion.   Science, despite lack of certainty, invites challenge.   No it doesn't. The 20th century gave us worldwide scientific wars, and finally nuclear weapons, when religions only ever gave us local or continental wars.  And by the way, I am not admitting that religion actually accounts for the causes of wars: the most religious ideas ever did was create the pretense for what were really economic struggles. Just like how scientific disagreements about race created the pretense for World War II.  (later edit) The way I phrased that (saying wars ""were really economic struggles"") was perhaps too strong. That suggests the Marxist doctrine of economic determinism, which was not what I mean. I mean that the economics of resource scarcity are what, in the end, causes what would otherwise be theoretical disagreements (whether about science or religion or anything else) to become practical and immediate. Without that, there would not be war, or at least not on a large scale. This is why I fear that the gay totalitarian fascists trying to get Christian bakers shut down because they won't make them their stupid pro-""gay marriage"" cupcakes are really inviting civil war. They are making what would otherwise be a theoretical disagreement into a, ""You will publicly endorse my ideology or else I will abuse the laws to forcibly take away your livelihood"" issue. That's how wars start.   Religion insists on its own certainty and therefore must defend against any challenge, to the point of war.

That way they can continue to deny things that are inconvenient for the people contributing to their campaigns, or continue to believe in whatever creation myth is at the bottom of their world view (and note that I didn't say fundamentalist Christians).

He helped redefine the understanding of the universe that existed when he was born, and you say he's a prime example of someone unwilling to believe something new. That's absurd on its face.  As for myths, I'm with Socrates: I'm sure I'm wrong. I'm sure something I believe in will turn out to be laughably wrong.

I wonder to what extent this sentiment is shared among religious people. Do they think that the decline in religious understanding is due to mass media?  However, I don't think science is a big deal if we are comparing with a medieval layman. Most questions that science has good answers to are pushed on us as important by science itself, but in reality knowing how the universe originated or where we came from is often peripheral to people's everyday concerns. What matters much more is moral questions and understanding of social norms. Science has changed this to some extent, but few serious scientists would advocate that science is in a position to answer moral questions (although its rhetoric is often called upon in non-scientific answers). However, the answers to these questions have become much more secularized and that means that an understanding of scripture becomes much less important for a religious person since they have other reasons for their norms. This secularization of morals is certainly associated with mass media, but I think the connection to science is superfluous."

Of the 70% of people in the US who self-identify as Christian (setting aside all other religions for a moment, about another 6%), how would anyone measure their religious knowledge vs. that of a medieval peasant?   Moreover, the idea that the Protestant Reformation ""happened because the religious awareness of common people was sound"" needs a whole lot of substantiation. Yes, the ""common people"" had a significant part in this, but how much were the gentry, merchants, and artisans vs. the peasantry?  Overall, there are some people in the US -- a large part of that 70% -- who are highly religiously literate. Others, no doubt, are not. Has the number who are religiously literate grown or shrunk as a portion of the population? Difficult to say, if it's even possible.  As for those who aren't religiously literate, that doesn't seem like a great mystery: we have many more options open to us today in literature, entertainment, and leisure time.

Self-identification has less to do with this as people can identify as religious without being actually engaged with doctrines and complicated theological issues.

The Protestant Reformation was really just a special case of heresy since it caught on in many countries and remains popular today. In any case, the heretics aren't any less engaged with the theology than the orthodox are.  In a society where denominations coexist within Christianity and with outside religions, modern Christians seem more concerned with drawing the line between Christianity and other religions than between their doctrine and other forms of Christianity. Modern people don't have to be literate to know that their neighbors probably have theological disagreements with them. But they are literate, so they can read books, magazines, and the Internet to find even more diverse viewpoints. As such, the charge of heresy, once a serious offense, is now not even grounds to be kicked out of the average church or to lose friends.   If a Christian sees so many diverse viewpoints on the minutia of theology, maybe they decide to embrace the ambiguity and not think about it too hard. If my friends and I get to heaven and so does Jim the Pentecostal and Jane the Catholic and 2 billion other Christians and many virtuous non-Christians depending on how generous God is feeling, what's the point in arguing?

At the time of the Protestant Reformation, scientific knowledge had not advanced to the point where it was able to challenge anything in the Bible.   So, yes, in order to argue with the people of past times, an atheist would have to develop more interesting philosophical arguments than they use to argue with a modern fundamentalist.  The New Atheists also talk about the problems of the religious establishment, and those arguments would be more likely to resonate with people back then.

A central notion of Stoicism, the philosophical doctrine with which Seneca is most closely identified, was the idea that being virtuous is the only truly beneficial thing, and the only thing that can make a person truly happy: wealth, like health, freedom and status, is a merely “indifferent thing”. It is something we might rather have than not, since people generally prefer not being in abject poverty, but wealth does not make a fundamental contribution to human happiness. Other Stoic writers, however, do not spend as much time as Seneca does puzzling over the proper attitude towards riches.'"

Live in accordance with nature. Do your best to act virtuously at all times.   I should be clear that I am no expert and only studied the Stoics out of my own curiosity about two years ago.  It is a beautiful philosophy and I have since been drawn to Buddhism and am still finding where these two ideas intersect all the time.  Cheers!"

Anyway we vote in Republocrats who are physically present at assemblies known as ""Congress"".  The problem is, is that this is not an assembly of the People. It's an assembly of the political class that largely has their alliances with the money that got them in power. Hence, laws benefit and reflect the major donors and benefactors of the politicians.  The point of having a representative democracy is necessary. 300 million people's input all at once sounds like more noise than conversation or progress. I'm not saying to throw out the whole system and the kitchen sink with it.  I'd imagine just an online platform like the WH Petitions site, but less idiotic. Maybe a bill template wiki or something like that. Anyway, edits would be made possible by anyone eligible to vote (SSN verification) and all edits and clauses are debated and voted upon. Just like Congress does.   Except, we can have doctors write a medicine law. Or farmers write an agriculture bill. In either case, it takes money out of the political equation because all proposals will be scrutinized and openly discussed in public.  From that point, all we would have to do is shop the proposal around to Congress. It doesn't replace Congress. It's just an idea that we can use the internet to work WITH Congress. A lot of the bill creation process consists of committees, subcommittees, input from industry professionals and researchers.   Honestly, after looking at the consistency of Wikipedia's reliability, and Reddit's ability to bury trolls, there is an interesting mesh in my head that I am cooking up. Think of this current comment thread as a sub-committee on a proposal.   Nothing's perfect. Our current system is clearly broken. Why not just give a shot at building a virtual place for citizens to gather and discuss political issues, write legislation, and vote on it? It's like, a pretend Congress. No harm done.   If the front page says ""give everyone in the US $10m"" and it has the most votes, Congress doesn't have to sponsor it. The ball is still in their court.

HistoryofIdeas,365faq,Qwill2,1 point,Sat May 16 08:49:17 2015 UTC,"Abstract:  The term “neoliberalism” is encountered everywhere today. In popular leftist political rhetoric it is often simply a place-holder for “contemporary capitalism”, “austerity politics”, and “all that is bad in our world”, giving that rhetoric the appearance of a new diagnostic edge. However, one could be excused for thinking that its intelligibility is in inverse proportion to its ubiquity.   By defining it in terms of its conceptual relationship with classical liberalism this paper offers a justification for thinking about our time as period in which a particular “community of ideas” has sought (with some success) to establish a neoliberal hegemony. Doing so reveals, however, that there are in fact a variety of neoliberalisms, and that the period we now inhabit is best conceived in terms of the rise of a distinctively economic variation.   Europe’s history is sketched (anachronistically) in terms of shifting patterns and transitions in which neoliberal variants vie for power. Setting those transitions within a wide-angled vision of Europe’s modernity as inseparable from a movement of the decentring of our understanding of “man”, the chance for a new shift is identified – one to be accompanied, no doubt, by “a surge of laughter” that has been heard, regularly and without fail, throughout the entirety of Europe’s history."

HistoryofIdeas,35htfq,iugameprof,8,Mon May 11 22:15:10 2015 UTC,"My favorite example: in neuroscience, we keep on bouncing between thinking brain function is segregated (region X does function X) and thinking it's integrated (function X is a whole-brain thing).  There are lots of nuances I'll gloss over, but an extremely short version is as follows. Very early on, it was pretty widely assumed that the brain was a big chunk of soup that didn't do anything terribly important. Then, various people around the world took note of the fact that a big whack to the head tended to produce specific cognitive issues. Then along comes Franz Gall and Phrenology, and suddenly brain function is segregated! But then Phrenology gets kind of bananas, and a guy named Pierre Flourens comes along and lesions bird cortex, and finds little evidence for localization of function, so look, it's actually integrated! But then Broca and Wernicke discover certain brain areas in the left frontal and temporal lobes that control very specific characteristics of speech, so look, it must be segregated! But then Karl Lashley looks for the ""engram"" (where memory lives) in the brain, and finds only nonspecific deficits commensurate with how much cortex he damaged, so look, it must be integrated! But wait, then we get to the early days of fMRI where people are publishing left and right that only one or two regions lit up for a given task, all these dissociations mean cortex must be segregated! But now we fast-forward to the modern era where things like functional networks and connectivity are being emphasized...so again, we're swinging back to integrated!  It's kind of funny, when you think about it that way."
HistoryofIdeas,35htfq,gnarmonica,4,Sun May 10 18:21:08 2015 UTC,"Good example. Cortical segregation still rules the day (it's in every paper talking about structural/behavioral correspondences)... albeit with significant amounts of collaborative integration.   Even more recently there was the pervasive thought that ""men and women's brains differ significantly in gross structure.""    But then: ""No they don't, that's out-moded patriarchal thinking!""    Except, yes they do. This is pretty much accepted now, I think, but a decade or two ago publishing on this would have been a career-ender (as told to me by a group of neurologists laughing at the idea of publishing their findings about the stark differences between male and female adult human brains)."

Though the pendulum does seem to be swinging, what with NIH recently mandating the inclusion of female rodents in many studies.  I myself am quite guilty of collapsing across male and female participants, but as far as I know, there isn't huge reason to suspect episodic memory fundamentally differs between the two sexes.

All you've told me is that you take him to be saying that Aristotle is a falsificationist.  What's wrong with this, I've proposed, is that Aristotle isn't a falsificationist.  Until you tell me on what basis you're attributing falsificationism to Aristotle, I don't know what else there is to say about this--you're the one who has introduced this business about Aristotle being a falsificationist, I'm the one who is puzzled by it, so I would think it would fall to you to explain what is going on with this claim.  And it's a strange claim at face: falsificationism is usually associated with a 20th century reaction against the 19th century inductivist account of the methodology of the scientific research program whose classical texts are from the 17th century.  What does any of this have to do with Aristotle?  Perhaps you could suggest some sort of answer to this question."
HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,wokeupabug,0,Thu May 7 03:40:30 2015 UTC,"Here's the passage in Herman, relying on the legacy of Aristotle's students Theophrastus, etc., who challenged the master's theories based on the master's own techniques:  ""He had seen his natural philosophy, including his physics and astronomy, as a complete and unshakably true picture of reality. But by stressing the power of observation as the main source of knowledge, he had let the genie run free. His students, even the loyal Theophrastus, felt compelled to question his theories based on new data or new observations. Strato contrived physical tests to bring Aristotle’s fondest assumptions under scrutiny. His work on creating an artificial vacuum, which Aristotle had said was impossible, may be the first true scientific experiment. In this way and almost in spite of himself, from the moment he first picked up a lungfish on the beach and wondered what was inside, Aristotle had created a Western scientific method that was destined to be permanently open-ended. It would be based on observation, analysis, and making fine distinctions (diairein) or divisions, instead of worrying about the Big Picture. It became the vehicle for research into every aspect of nature. It would lead in directions Aristotle himself never imagined, and not just in Athens.  Herman, Arthur (2013-10-22).

HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,aramis720,2,Fri May 8 07:45:48 2015 UTC,"Well, he doesn't mention falsificationism here, which isn't just the idea of testing ideas.  And his reasoning is rather peculiar: he notes, rightly, that Aristotle understood the claims of his physics to be necessarily true and thus not open to revision, but then attributes to Aristotle quite the opposite view, on the basis that Theophratus and Strato challenged some of the things he said.  I'm not sure what one wishes to make of that, but that Aristotle is the father of falsificationism and/or modern science seem to me rather incredible inferences from such an observation.  The idea that one is being scientific in the Aristotelian spirit when one rejects Aristotle's methodology claims and objects to his physical claims strikes me as rather odd, but if we were to agree to speak in this way, then surely the medievals are more ""scientific in the Aristotelian spirit"", not less.  For the first great critique of Aristotelian physics came from the 6th century Christian--and was argued on explicitly Christian principles--Philoponus.  And this critique of Aristotelian physics directly inspired the reasoning which ran from Philoponus through people like Oresme to Galileo and the scientific revolution."
HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,wokeupabug,-1,Fri May 8 20:59:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree it's a bit tenuous but the point in the OP I think is valid to some degree in that clearly a fairly rigorous scientific method was created by Aristotle and his colleagues way back in classical Greece and yet scientific progress was extremely slow until the Renaissance and a revival of the experimental method. As I continue with Herman's book I'm reminded of what I wrote above: religious thinking and in particular Christianity have had a very suppressing effect on the development of scientific thought. I urge you to read Herman's book, Ghosts of Darwin, by Rebecca Stott, or any thematic history of scientific thought. The history is rife with examples of free thinkers and scientists/philosophers (they were the same until the modern era, of course) being oppressed and suppressed and in a great many cases tortured, murdered, and their works destroyed. I don't know how any rational person, unless there is a Christian agenda attached, can review the last two thousand years of western history and not come away with a strong impression that the church has been an oppositional force to scientific and rational thinking for most of its history, continuing of course today with people like Rick Santorum literally calling for people to not go to college b/c it might interfere with their faith."
HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,aramis720,3,Tue May 12 19:42:02 2015 UTC,"I would argue that infact it was not. At least in the Middle Ages Aristotle was hugely popular and formed a solid foundation of the understanding of the world. While people did not use scientific method as the one seen after the 17-th century. You can see this evident from people like Armen Firmen or Elmer of Melmsbury or HIldegard von Blingen, you can see it in 14-15-th century books of war and from fencing manuals in the same period. Not to mention the entire scholastic tradition of the Middle East and Byzantium. So essentially it did not disappear. It only became less popular in some parts of the world."
HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,cybelechild,1 point,Wed May 6 11:36:35 2015 UTC,"This is what I find interesting: Aristotle was well-respected as an authority by the Catholic Church, after the re-discovery of his works by way of the Islamic world, but the scientific methods that Aristotle taught were clearly not part of the Church's embrace. To the contrary, the Church was a massive force opposing scientific inquiry. So while we can pretty obviously blame the church in large part for the suppression of scientific method and fact-based views of the world from the 12th or 13th century onward, was it simply that Aristotle's works were lost to the ""civilized"" world before then and thus his legacy was forgotten for so long?"
HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,aramis720,3,Wed May 6 22:33:33 2015 UTC,"...but the scientific methods that Aristotle taught were clearly not part of the Church's embrace.   No, nothing like this happened.  Aristotle's natural philosophy is the central context for the medieval understanding of nature, through to the developments in the Renaissance and Early Modern periods leading up to modern science, which involved a fairly broad rejection of the Aristotelian legacy.  Just look at the major works of natural philosophy during this period.  Prior to the recovery of Aristotle through Islamic Peripateticism, natural philosophy occurred principally in a Platonic context, though a Platonic context also steeped in Aristotle through the neo-Platonic synthesis.  This is plain in the major works of natural philosophy during this period, i.e. those from Eriugena and the so-called School of Chartres.  Now let's look at the period following the encounter with Islamic Peripateticism: Robert Grosseteste, Albert Magnus, and Roger Bacon, the most important proto-scientific thinkers in this period, are all steeped in Aristotle.  As are William of Auvergne, Thomas Aquinas, and Bonaventure, who are not as important as proto-scientific thinkers but are influential in natural philosophy more generally.  What is non-Aristotelian about these thinkers is only that they've received a long tradition of commentary on the Platonic and Aristotelian sources which gives them indeed all the Aristotelian ideas, but also a millennium of reflection which represents a significant advance over anything Aristotle himself had--manifest, e.g., in the tradition of optics which would be so important for the tradition through Grosseteste and Bacon.   To the contrary, the Church was a massive force opposing scientific inquiry.   No, it wasn't: almost without exception, the figures just mentioned developed their proto-scientific and natural-philosophical thoughts in the context of orthodox medieval theology governed by the institution of the church.  And when the church opposed Aristotelian natural philosophy, this ended up being in service of the development toward modern science, not in opposition to it--most famously in the developments surrounding the Condemnations of 1277, which led to a rejection of Aristotelian a-priori-ism in natural philosophy, and its replacement by the experimental method.  Thus, medieval natural philosophy begins to move away from the Aristotelian heritage starting in the 14th century, first in the hands of late scholastics like Oresme (following the early anti-Aristotelian lead already given by Philoponus), then in the hands of Renaissance philosophers like Nicholas of Cusa, and finally in the famous figures of the scientific revolution through to the instatement of modern physics in the thought of Descartes and Newton.  All of this was a manifestly anti-Aristotelian development--in favor of what we now call a scientific view.   So while we can pretty obviously blame the church in large part for the suppression of scientific method and fact-based views of the world from the 12th or 13th century onward, was it simply that Aristotle's works were lost to the ""civilized"" world before then and thus his legacy was forgotten for so long?   No, none of these things happened."
HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,wokeupabug,1 point,Wed May 6 23:08:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed reply. What I'm getting it is the fact that it seems (based on my reading of Herman's The Cave and the Light, which seems well-researched but could of course be inaccurate in some ways) that Aristotle and his colleagues did indeed develop an early version of falsificationism in their scientific method. So even though Aristotle's teachings were accepted by the Church in many ways, it seems pretty clear that his scientific method and his falsificationist approach to knowledge more generally were not.   In terms of the role of the church in opposing the development of scientific method and new scientific knowledge, I'm a bit confused by your rejection of their pretty widely-accepted opposition. How does the burning at the stake of Bruno and the trial and house arrest of Galileo fit within your statements, as just two very prominent examples of widespread persecution of free thinkers? And the development of evolutionary theory, which as we can see from reading works like The Ghost of Darwin, a history of Darwinian thought before Darwin, was rife with concerns about official religious reaction and condemnation of anything that contradicted Biblical teachings. Or is your point more narrow than this?   Can you recommend a couple of books describing this history?"
HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,aramis720,2,Thu May 7 18:51:09 2015 UTC,"based on my reading of Herman's The Cave and the Light, which seems well-researched but could of course be inaccurate in some ways   I would take Herman's The Cave and the Light with a grain shovel of salt.  It might be a nice story that Herman is putting to good strategic use to present his own ideas about modern society, but it's positively dreadful as an account of the ideas of Plato and Aristotle.  The standard history of philosophy is Copleston's A History of Philosophy, with volume one covering ancient philosophy, volumes two and three covering medieval, and volumes four to six covering early modern.  An alternative that is shorter is Kenny's New History of Western Philosophy, and an alternative focusing more on ancient thought is Reale's History of Ancient Philosophy, with volume two covering Plato and Aristotle.   ...that Aristotle and his colleagues did indeed develop an early version of falsificationism in their scientific method.   Surely they didn't, but again without some account of what you're talking about here, I'm not sure how we can proceed in discussing it critically.   So even though Aristotle's teachings were accepted by the Church in many ways, it seems pretty clear that his scientific method and his falsificationist approach to knowledge more generally were not.   This sounds plainly incorrect, I would love to see some evidence for it.   In terms of the role of the church in opposing the development of scientific method and new scientific knowledge, I'm a bit confused by your rejection of their pretty widely-accepted opposition.    The conflict thesis isn't widely accept by scholars who study these things.   How does the burning at the stake of Bruno and the trial and house arrest of Galileo fit within your statements, as just two very prominent examples of widespread persecution of free thinkers?   Well, Bruno never did any science and was tried for his theological views, and if you want to believe that the problem with Galileo is that the church wouldn't accept any anti-geocentrism talk, I'd like to hear how you reconcile this thesis with the church's rather different response to Cusanus' anti-geocentrism, which predates Galileo's by nearly two centuries--nb: they made him a cardinal.  In any case, neither the conflict thesis nor this thesis about an occult tradition of falsificationism created by Aristotle and then lost until Popper get any defense from isolated instances of conflict, even if we're happy to recognize these cases as that."
HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,wokeupabug,2,Thu May 7 21:05:56 2015 UTC,"The conflict thesis isn't widely accept by scholars who study these things.   On this point, it may be worth pointing to the main literature on the subject. For example, this is a fairly good basic reading list (at least with regard to ancient and medieval, though I assume the same is true for the other periods covered).  Furthermore, this article by David Lindberg and Ronald Numbers, dealing specifically with the conflict thesis, is instructive."
HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,qed1,1 point,Thu May 7 21:31:26 2015 UTC,"qed1, the Lindberg and Numbers article surely can't be taken seriously. Here's one example of their preposterous reasoning: ""Although sentenced to house arrest for the rest of his life, he lived comfortably in a villa outside Florence. He was neither tortured nor imprisoned-simply silenced. The Galileo affair was a multi-faceted event. Certainly it raised serious questions about the relationship between reason and revelation and the proper means of reconciling the teachings of nature with those of scripture. Nonetheless, it was not a matter of Christianity waging war on science. All of the participants called themselves Christians, and all acknowledged biblical authority. This was a struggle between opposing theories of biblical interpretation: a conservative theory issuing from the Council of Trent versus Galileo's more liberal alternative, both well precedented in the history of the church. Personal and political factors also played a role, as Galileo demonstrated his flair for cultivating enemies in high places."""
HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,aramis720,2,Wed May 13 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"This doesn't seem particularly preposterous reasoning. Rather it seems a natural point to make that the complexities of the Galileo affair don't lend themselves to the sort of conflict narrative forwarded by White, but are better understood within the particular historical context (viz. the council of trent and the counter-reformation). (I mean, I'll readily admit that I'm not a massive fan of the way this section has been embellished, but the actual point being made here seems fine.)"
HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,qed1,1 point,Wed May 13 21:13:20 2015 UTC,"I think the quote seriously downplays the seriousness of the trial and the lifetime house arrest and, even more importantly, the chilling effect on others that this case and others like it had. And to frame it as a dispute among Christians misses the obvious fact that everyone was Christian back then by default b/c if you weren't you had no access to society. I do agree that Galileo was an abrasive personality and not a very good politician but that seems sort of beside the point in terms of the debate about the Church's role in suppressing and oppressing science and scientists over the centuries."
HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,aramis720,1 point,Thu May 14 18:39:34 2015 UTC,"You seem to be sidestepping the point I just made and the central thesis of the article. This is an argument that the whole framing that White brings to the picture is unhelpful, ideologically  driving and generally just whig history. Thus, we should view Galileo not in the context of a transhistorical struggle between ""Christianity"" and ""Science"", but we should instead approach the issue from the particular historical context, specifically, the counter-reformation and the Council of Trent. It is within this context that Galileo's Christianity is brought up and, you will note, that it is discussed not merely as a confessional identity (which, as you suggest, would indeed be a trivial point), but in the context of Galileo's position within a serious debate over what interpretive principles should govern Biblical exegesis. This is obviously a pertinent point in the context of the counter-reformation, a period when the Catholic hierarchy was increasingly concerned about issues of hierarchical authority especially in the context of interpreting the Bible (a key point of conflict between Catholics and Protestants, particularly in this period). As a result, Galileo's Christianity is not an incidental feature of the narrative, but an integral aspect of the whole affair.  Similarly, the article does not set out to suggest that the role of the church hierarchy in this period was unilaterally positive or negative. Rather, it argues that we need to understand this in terms of all the relevant facts, involving not only the Catholic hierarchy and Galileo, but also things like political factors, legitimate scientific discourse, personal factors of the individuals involved and so on, not reifying ""Christianity"" and ""Science"" into concrete historical entities."
HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,qed1,1 point,Thu May 14 20:27:29 2015 UTC,"I was actually asking about a history of science rather than a history of philosophy. I've read pretty widely in both areas and my take home is that the Church has been a pervasive and pretty consistent opponent of free thinking, fact-based inquiry and scientific thought more generally. As I wrote above, I highly recommend you read Herman's book. It includes citations and quotes to many many thinkers who were oppressed or suppressed by the Church to varying degrees. For most of the middle ages rational thought was not considered appropriate for anything but examining the teachings of the Bible.   So it wasn't for most serious thinkers about using reason to practice science in a general sense but, instead, about taking a scientific approach to the Bible and the Lord's word. Going beyond the use of logic and serious inquiry in service of Biblical understanding was not encouraged and was often highly discouraged. And in many more extreme cases free thinkers were actively persecuted, tortured, murdered.   Bruno was of course a serious free thinker and his work was as scientific as any other person's work in that era b/c science and philosophy were one until the modern era. And even if we dismiss Bruno as ""merely"" a philosopher, surely you see the problem with your dismissal of his burning at the stake by the Church? Bruno's trial included charges about his cosmological belief in the plurality of worlds (other planets), so it wasn't purely theological in terms of debates about Biblical doctrines. It was very much about his broader worldview and its conflict with the Catholic Church.   In terms of Galileo, I highly recommend Kim Stanley Robinson's novelization of his trial in Galileo's Dream. Yes, it's a sci fi book but the facts and history are accurate and it gives a good feel for what it was like to be a free thinker in that era. These are not isolated instances; they were pervasive and exerted a major chilling effect on all free thinkers for centuries.   As for Cusanus, he was part of the church before he espoused anti-geocentric views and perhaps his milieu was simply more forgiving of heresy than the general milieu of the many other free thinkers who were indirectly or actively persecuted for their beliefs by the Church. Each country and era is of course different but in terms of establishing a general trend and a general conclusion about the role of the Catholic Church in scientific progress over the centuries it seems that the clear preponderance of evidence weighs in favor of the ""Church as suppressor and oppressor"" viewpoint."
HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,aramis720,1 point,Tue May 12 19:57:05 2015 UTC,"PS. As two more prominent examples of religious persecution and its chilling effect: Copernicus didn't publish his major work until after his death, and Darwin waited decades before publishing his magnum opus, On the Origin of Species, because of his fears of a major backlash against him and his family, which did in fact materialize, much to the chagrin of his god-fearing wife."
HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,aramis720,1 point,Wed May 13 07:39:14 2015 UTC,I would have to disagree with the church being a massive oposition to scientiffic endeavour in that period. This is something that appears later during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. In fact a lot of the most interesting accounts from that period in regards to things like that come from church people - I.e. Elmer of Malmsbury from my previous post.
HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,cybelechild,1 point,Thu May 7 06:15:32 2015 UTC,"I've learned in reading Herman that Aristotle, Averroes and many other thinkers were banned by the Church at various times, including as early as the 13th Century: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condemnations_of_1210%E2%80%931277. So official Church condemnation and oppression goes back much further than you suggest."
HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,aramis720,1 point,Wed May 13 07:17:34 2015 UTC,"True. At various times and different places it happens.

HistoryofIdeas,350d8q,cybelechild,1 point,Wed May 13 07:56:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it seems that the weight of evidence shows that the Church was pushing ""down"" hard while free thinkers were pushing ""up"" and that over the course of a thousand years or so finally free thinkers started to win this dynamic."

For what it's worth there is a strange mention of ""Bellow"" in the article (whom I assume to be the novelist Saul Bellow), his name just being floated there:  ""Unlike traditionalist conservative thinkers who conflated liberalism with the New Left, neoconservatives believed the New Left had infected the liberal intellectual culture they loved. That they detected such a change was one of the central reasons for their political conversion; it was one of the primary reasons neoconservatives proved so useful to the modern American conservative movement. By siding against contemporary intellectual mores, Bellow and the neoconservatives aligned with the more authentic sensibilities of average Americans. In other words, the neoconservative mind was the intellectualization of the white working-class ethos.""

Both are also sometimes called by the German version of their name, Jacob/Jakob Faber. He himself had a sometimes tense relationship with Erasmus, whose work on Biblical translation and in theology closely paralleled his own.  Although he anticipated some ideas that were important to the Protestant Reformation, Lefèvre remained a Roman Catholic throughout his life, and sought to reform the church without separating from it. Several of his books were condemned as heretical, and he spent some time in exile. He was, however, a favorite of the king of France, Francis I, and enjoyed his protection."

I was recently investigating the writings of Harrington which apparently had a significant influence on both American and the French radical thinking during the late 1700s.   Lefebvre de Villebrune, Curator of the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris in 1794, in recommending Harrington's writings to the readers of Le Moniteur on July 4th 1794, claims to have found in them not only the blueprint for the structure of the french National Convention they were governed by but a warning on the importance of passing legislation outlawing as high treason any attempts by any members or groups to re-establish or consolidating in the hands of any single individual or magistrate government over the people.

According to tradition, the twins were abandoned by their parents as babies, but were saved by a she-wolf who found and nursed them. Romulus killed his brother after a vicious quarrel, and went on to found a city, which was named after him.  The myth has been at the core of Roman identity since the 1st century AD, although the details vary in different versions of the story. For many Roman writers, the story embodied the ethos and institutions of their civilisation. The image of the she-wolf suckling the divinely fathered twins remains a potent icon of the city even today."

Humans have found three main ways to get the energy they need—from foraging, farming, and fossil fuels. Each energy source sets strict limits on what kinds of societies can succeed, and each kind of society rewards specific values. In tiny forager bands, people who value equality but are ready to settle problems violently do better than those who aren’t; in large farming societies, people who value hierarchy and are less willing to use violence do best; and in huge fossil-fuel societies, the pendulum has swung back toward equality but even further away from violence.  But if our fossil-fuel world favors democratic, open societies, the ongoing revolution in energy capture means that our most cherished values are very likely to turn out—at some point fairly soon—not to be useful any more."

Many would argue that it was not until the colonial encounter that South Asians began to understand themselves as religious. In Religion, Science, and Empire: Classifying Hinduism and Islam in British India (Oxford University Press, 2012), Peter Gottschalk, Professor of Religion at Wesleyan University, outlines the contingent and mutual coalescence of science and religion as they were cultivated within the structures of empire. He demonstrates how the categories of Hindu and Muslim were constructed and applied to the residents of the Chainpur nexus of villages by the British despite the fact that these identities were not always how South Asians described themselves.   Throughout this study we are made aware of the consequences of comparison and classification in the study of religion. Gottschalk engages Jonathan Z. Smith’s modes of comparison demonstrating that seemingly neutral categories serve ideological purposes and forms of knowledge are not arbitrary in order. Here, we observe this work through imperial forms of knowledge production in South Asia, including the roles of cartographers, statisticians, artists, ethnographers, and photographers.   In the end we witness the social consequences of British scientism and its effects on the construction of the category of religion in South Asia. In our conversation we discuss mapmaking, travel writing, Christian theology, the authority of positioning, the census, folklore studies, ethnographies, royal societies, museums, indigenous identifications, and theories for the study of religion."

HistoryofIdeas,32gmag,Qwill2,2,Mon Apr 13 17:12:26 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, especially starting with the third paragraph. From there it seems like there was a lot of liberties taken by the reviewer to write an article about Heidegger's Nazism and critiquing Arendt for not being harsher on him. It's hard for me to imagine that this book is a polemic, but it could be.  I also thought there was a strange idiosyncrasy. At one point when the article is deriding Arendt the author claims ""Arendt found being a friend to the Jewish people a challenge too far"". Later in the article there is a quote from Arendt: Arendt would argue, as she did, that “I have never in my life ‘loved’ any people or collective. … I indeed love ‘only’ my friends and the only kind of love I know of and believe in is the love of persons.”  It seems like these two ideas are at odds with each other. Seems like Arendt thought you couldn't be friends with the Jewish people anymore than the German or American. What's up with this?"
HistoryofIdeas,32gmag,shuddering_bass,2,Mon Apr 13 23:56:57 2015 UTC,"Heidegger's actually intimately linked to Nazism, just look at the German wikipedia article's length on the topic: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger_und_der_Nationalsozialismus  Heidegger also reacted very positive to Nazism.

HistoryofIdeas,328bi9,Qwill2,1 point,Sat Apr 11 14:07:58 2015 UTC,"Nietzsche has often been held to be a highly individualistic thinker. According to this reading, he concerns himself with the wellbeing of a few choice individuals, and cares little about ""the herd,"" except insofar as they are a help or a hindrance to these exceptional individuals and their project of self-cultivation.   Julian Young's pioneering 2006 study Nietzsche's Philosophy of Religion questioned this traditional interpretation. It sought to situate Nietzsche in a strand of communitarian thinking, according to which the community as a whole, not individuals, is the primary locus of value. Such a community flourishes when it is united under the horizon of a shared worldview, especially one of guiding myths (whether of doctrinal religion or otherwise) that give intelligibility and meaning to human life.   On Young's interpretation, it is not just in Nietzsche's early work that these communitarian themes predominate; confining them here would be a more widely accepted and uncontroversial claim among Nietzsche scholars. Rather, Young argues that they persist right to the end of Nietzsche's career.  The present volume builds on this interpretive outlook -- developing, challenging and expanding it.

I didn't mean to be overly negative about the article. I just don't really see the link between Thomas More, ISIS and the Holocaust apart from in the broadest of terms.  On top of that; I am skeptical of all these ideas floating around about Thomas More that the article is riffing on. They are based on a TV program of a fictional book, in which he is used as a a plot device and to act as the nemesis for the central character.  I am also skeptical of what we in the west are being told about ISIS. They are clearly violent extremists but I think the media and government has lost all sense of perspective. The UK government (where I live) is looking in to ways to take away citizenship for people travelling to the same area that ISIS inhabit. This is outrageous.  And finally the holocaust, a horrific crime that the western media use as a short hand for evil. Its become a metaphor in our culture and I'm with Orwell that metaphors weaken understanding.     The article told me nothing new about any of these three things, but worst, from my own perspective, it did not expose any of the shallow images that are floating around in society about all of them. Instead it found the lowest common denominator between them and used it to link them together.  I think he had a deadline and a contract to put something up on the guardian website. I might be wrong but the whole article is bullshit."

HistoryofIdeas,308nu8,MGumbley,0,Wed Mar 25 17:51:09 2015 UTC,"What is shown is that whether it is a religious context or a non-religious or atheistic one, the concept of humanity is inadequate for dealing with these situations. While the potential for falling from essence, as Heidegger interestingly noted, is there, this can not replace what is irreducible and speaks throughout any and every single expression of concern over these sorts of violences: nonviolence, the amelioration and prevention of violence. What keeps people from making this basic turn? This is what is tested today in the problem of ISIS and what has been tested all along. It is where the failure lies, just as after the Egyption revolution of 2011 exhibited the failure in a more specific context of protest, virtually everyone failed to even remember the role that nonviolence played in that revolution. And that failure owes to this much broader one.   It is this non-starter, not a forgetting, but a failure even to begin -- aside from a few exceptions, and these often enough are limping ones -- to think and experience nonviolence as such. This must be understood in two forms, where the first, tactical nonviolence in political contexts, must be seen as just one manifestation of a broader, more originary condition of nonviolence that is in a certain sense everywhere. No, not absolutely everywhere, and often enough it is forgotten or ignored, but it is also there, even when an ISIS member is careful to protect a fellow terrorist.   The critical issue is the turning in which there is a turn to nonviolence as a thematic and substantive matter for thought and action, plain and simple. While this may seem simple or even obvious at times, it is apparently quite difficult to effectuate in certain ways. Thinking through it extensively has its own concomitant problematics and ways, just as does any specific topic, from virology to economics."

I have read few non-fiction books that are as much of a page-turner as this one.      The main purpose of the book is to explore the historical and practical roots of modern postcolonial theory.  It looks at how various populations, political parties, movements, intellectuals, etc. analyzed and thought about colonialism and imperialism and global political economy through the centuries, focusing mostly on anti-colonial thought (since this is where postcolonial theory came from).  As a result, it shines a bright spotlight on the vibrant movements in the Third World that took place throughout the 20th century that pushed for self-determination, nationalism, cultural preservation, and socialism (efforts that more often than not had a large degree of internal tension)."

Luther, as far as I know, said lets abandon tradition, and follow the scripture alone. Ibn Taymiyya, if this is true, is saying exactly the opposite.   Anyways, I don't know much about the reforms of christianity and Islam, what I do know, is that the problem of today's so called Muslims is what is called hadith, which goes exactly agains the Quran (The reason for which is that hadith is mostly made up, there are some 50 books of hadith, as far as I know). Here are some verses from the Quran which completely rejects what any muslim terrorist does:   [2:190] You may fight in the cause of GOD against those who attack you, but do not aggress. GOD does not love the aggressors.  [2:193] You may also fight them to eliminate oppression, and to worship GOD freely. If they refrain, you shall not aggress;aggression is permitted only against the aggressors.  [5:87] O you who believe, do not prohibit good things that are made lawful by GOD, and do not aggress; GOD dislikes the aggressors.  [42:42] The wrong ones are those who treat the people unjustly, and resort to aggression without provocation. These have incurred a painful retribution.  On top of that, with regards to forceful conversion of the people, the Quran says:  [2:256] There shall be no compulsion in religion: the right way is now distinct from the wrong way. Anyone who denounces the devil and believes in GOD has grasped the strongest bond; one that never breaks. GOD is Hearer, Omniscient. [10:99] Had your Lord willed, all the people on earth would have believed. Do you want to force the people to become believers? The Quran says it has to be followed thoroughly. All of the commandments in it. Hence when it says you shall not aggress, and not force people into believing, then that is that. But today's muslims follow other sources beside the Quran. There is no contradiction within the Quran, but the sources they follow beside the Quran are contradictory.  Here is what the Quran says about people who only partially follow it (For example, they aggress, while the Quran says that they are not allowed to do so):  [2:85] Yet, here you are killing each other, and evicting some of you from their homes, banding against them sinfully and maliciously. Even when they surrendered, you demanded ransom from them. Evicting them was prohibited for you in the first place. Do you believe in part of the scripture and disbelieve in part? What should be the retribution for those among you who do this, except humiliation in this life, and a far worse retribution on the Day of Resurrection? GOD is never unaware of anything you do."

They didn't like a single historical movie, making the same complaints that are in this post (and deftly skirting the details with a line like ""I’m not going to go into great detail about everything that is wrong with the film"").  The problem is, they really miss the point. These movies create awareness about the rough details of a historical moment. This movie's purpose quite obviously was to shed some light on the tragedy and injustice of Turing's persecution and untimely death. It did this very well.  Yes, historians care about the details.

Because, well, characterizing the popular movie in this way makes the historians feel better about themselves--they are elites who know the real story unlike the unwashed masses who are fed the swill of anachronisms. It's just another way for academics to feel arrogant and superior, which seemed to be about 80% of what went on in universities when I worked there as a PhD student and TT prof at a research-institution.

But instead they claim it to be based on real history which to most people, as most of them will never read any more, means that it is pure and simple history.   They did this to trade on the currency that people are watching the pictures of a character who genuinely existed and learning something about him.   I don't believe Alan Turing would take the trade-off of being better known as a name and yet so woefully misrepresented as a person. And for what? Why not just represent his true character?

Then I found his Selected Spiritual Writings on Archive.org, and started On the Moral Interpretation of the Ark of Noah. I expected that to be kind of a snoozefest, but, instead Hugh's voice is surprisingly alive and personal.  I love this quote by him;  ""Learn everything. Later you will see that nothing is superfluous.” Hugh of Saint-Victor  My only disappointment is that apparently not much is known about his life."
HistoryofIdeas,2z62w0,jyamamo,14,Sun Mar 15 22:23:56 2015 UTC,"He published a similar essay in the New Statesman when Pinker's book first came out. Gray is something of a broken record on certain topics. Whenever someone argues that moral progress is possible, he equates this argument to an eschatological vision in which the world is progressing toward some predetermined state. This is a bogus move, as Pinker, Grayling, and other of Gray's targets are very explicit that they do not view moral progress as something that proceeds by any lawful plan.  As for Pinker's thesis, I found the book to be fascinating, but I feel that he never quite responded to his harshest critics. Gray was one, but his roughest review was from the historian of Eastern Europe Timothy Snyder."
HistoryofIdeas,2z62w0,hexag1,8,Sun Mar 15 23:54:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the Snyder connection, which I hadn't come across. Snyder seems at least to grant the statistical validity of Pinker's thesis (""Pinker is [probably] right that the ratio of violent to peaceful deaths has improved over time""); his central criticism is over whether the cause of the decline of violence can be ascribed to a ""civilizing process"". I think that has been the main focus of criticism so far, and the indications are that researchers in my area (the early modern period) are raising serious doubts about blending the statistics on violence with Norbert Elias's thesis. See for example Richard McMahon, Joachim Eibach and Randolph Roth, in “Making sense of violence? Reflections on the history of interpersonal violence in Europe” (Crime, Histoire & Sociétés, 17:2, 2013, pp. 5-26). They are currently at work editing a volume which I think is going to raise a lot of questions about the civilizing process thesis and present alternative theories that would explain the statistics.  The question of how to measure violence is a vexed one. The historical records are patchy, there are issues about who should be counted and how (should we include refugees from a war zone dying of malaria, for example?), and even when we come up with statistics finding ways to explain them is fraught with uncertainties; as Gray says, they ""might mean only that fertilizers and anti­biotics are outpacing machine guns and machetes"".  I don't think there's any doubt that, for people living in most states today, there is far less direct exposure to violence in the public sphere. The gibbets and whipping posts have disappeared, vengeance, vendetta and vigilantism have largely been replaced by the dispassionate rule of law, corporal punishment of children in schools and in the home is dying out, and so on. It seems the jury is still out on the question of how that gibes with other forms of violence (some of which are on the increase) and on the question of whether people living in such societies are inherently predisposed to be less violent than their forebears."

There are certainly problems with a number of the thinkers they mention, but on this point they're dead wrong:    Here left and right touch in their extremes: it is precisely a libertarian ethos of freedom that dominates their vision, as David Harvey has insightfully pointed out: “This is the world that libertarian Republicans construct. It is also the view of individual liberty and freedom embraced by much of the anarchist and autonomist left, even as the capitalist version of the free market is roundly condemned.”   It's absurd to attribute this to any of the thinkers the authors name, whatever other problems they might have with them.  Charles Taylor said something very, very similar about Michel Foucault in Sources of the Self—i.e. that Foucault promotes an ""anything goes"" ethos, which is absolute nonsense— and that was just as foolish a claim then as this is now.   With statements like this:   Today’s radical intellectuals do not feel compelled to defend their arguments or respond to their critics. Their purported radicalism becomes all the more opaque when the coherence of their claims is called into question. A concern for an exaggerated subjectivity, identity politics, anti-empirical theories of power, an obsession with “difference” – all serve to deplete the radical tradition of its potency.   The authors essentially demonstrate that they haven't really read anyone they're complaining about - of course, they already do that by failing to address a single argument or notion from any of these people.  This style of argument by assertion is facile, played out and frigging boring.   Edit: words"

To me the important points are about the disappearance of class politics and working-class movements, and the disastrous effect that's had on fashionable ""left"" theory's ability to articulate an actual concrete politics. The bullshittier parts are the grousing about Theory (that's the part that seems like a really weird '90s throwback) and especially the bizarre claims that fashionable high-theory thinkers have had a causal effect on the erosion of the left rather than quite the opposite.

We can guess the shape of that politics by the various things that it apparently does not include, such as anarchism and various currents of contemporary Marxism.

In this episode, he examines the moral power that debt holds over us.  David argues that whenever we think about debt we end up in a deep moral confusion. We resent the ""deadbeats"" who fail to pay us back and yet many of us believe that people who get us into debt - money lenders - are immoral if not downright evil.  Gangsters like Don Corleone frame what they do in terms of debt. They do so in the knowledge that debt is a powerful tool for taking even pure extortion and making it seem like it's the debtor who is in the wrong. We can't help but believe Don Corleone when he tells us we owe him one.  It's not just gangsters who utilise the moral power of debt. Over the course of history commanders of foreign armies, wealthy landlords, corrupt officials, and local thugs have been able to tell their victims that those victims owe them something. If nothing else, they ""owe them their lives"" (a telling phrase) because they haven't killed them.  For most of human history, most human beings have been told that they are debtors. In this series, David examines the human consequences which have profound implications for the politics of the present day."

This is very true. At present the postal service is a business organised on the lines of a state-capitalist monopoly. Imperialism is gradually transforming all trusts into organisations of a similar type.  To organise the whole national economy on the lines of the postal service, so that the technicians, foremen, book-keepers, as well as all officials, shall receive salaries no higher than ‘a workman’s wage’, all under the control and leadership of the armed proletariat — this is our immediate aim.

Of course the author chooses to completely ignore arguably the two single most influential forces on  composition of the last 50 years--minimalism and jazz. This relegation of those styles to the ""popular"" only serves to reenforce the divide he seeks to purport: that composition today is out of touch and is essentially the the same modernism of one finds in Boulez or Stockhausen, which certainly isn't the case at all.  One needs to look no further than today's most popular living composers-- Adams, Reich, Glass, Lang, etc.-- to view this exception as ridiculous.     So, in conservatoires and music departments, nobody teaches harmony and counterpoint any more, although this, as explained above, is fundamental to all Western music.   If the author knew anything at all about the curriculum in music schools today, he would know that this is simply not the case.  But the articles conclusion presents the most ridiculous claim of them all:   However, this is only possible if we allow leadership and authority back into our artistic institutions, if we take a suitably compassionate pride in our national identity, and, without any awkwardness or shame, have belief in the value and virtue of our  Judaeo-Christian roots.   His whole argument is built on the fact that dissolution of nation-state and Christianity gave way to the divorce of classical music and the context of its reception.  The deux ex machina is of course the speculation that the youth have ""very little real to rebel against anymore"" (the author here is not referring to the Lacanian real) because the oh-so politically correct culture we live in itself suppresses any inclination towards dissent.  This speculation incites his aesthetic solution to contradiction: to alienate music even further from the concrete sociopolitical trends of our time.  Like anything else, new music will remain relevant only as long as it speaks to the culture it is situated in... And this nonsense gets upvotes?"

""Classical music"" is very popular as it was a hundred years ago but now it's popularity is lived on in the cinemas and the TV shows. Part of the reason why a lot of newer stuff isn't that great is because academic music is extremely conservative for the most part and I think academic music got way too isolated for the general populace. Christianity and the Church influenced music definitely especially in certain modes but we live in a secular society anyhow.   To me the true music stars of the 20th centuries are the heroes of jazz. Someone like Coltrane is a transcendental genius of the highest order and will be studied a lot more in the future than some 20th century composers. His most notable work is even Christian in nature. A Love Supreme. I highly suggested listening to it fully. It's a piece of art that touches sublime. It will definitely be remembered like Beethovens symphonies or Bachs concertos."

A lot of the times it would work like a guild you would get an apprenticeship and eventually you was get patronage from various sources once you master it. I suppose if I had to pinpoint when formal western music became academic it would be late 19th early 20th century. Although the guild style system continued until very recently until the advent of convenience recorded music. Around the 80s was when it slowed down quite a bit. You wouldn't get hired for playing your horn at an event but rather a DJ or something would take over.  The DJ system is a lot more individual unless you make it big you won't have an agent.

HistoryofIdeas,2xkvy6,Qwill2,2,Sun Mar 1 18:08:08 2015 UTC,"FTL: (wiki links added)   Edward Bernays, born in Vienna in 1891 and famously the nephew of Sigmund Freud, was perhaps the pioneer in the field of Public Relations, and highly influential in providing the framework for modern advertising. His work aimed to convince people to want things that they didn’t need, and in the process, link their unconscious desires to the consumption of mass produced goods. This in turn, it was theorized, could be used to control the masses, as by keeping them distracted on frivolous happenings and relatively unimportant wants, they wouldn’t interfere with the activities of what he called ‘the important few’.  All the while, he was remarkably candid about his intent. In one of his first books, Propaganda (1928), he coined the term ‘engineering of consent’ to describe his technique for controlling the masses. In this podcast series, Guy Evans examines just how influential these ideas were, and details the resulting impact in relation to public relations, advertising, celebrity culture, and democracy itself.   Read more about Propaganda on Wikipedia:   Propaganda, an influential book written by Edward L. Bernays in 1928, incorporated the literature from social science and psychological manipulation into an examination of the techniques of public communication. Bernays wrote the book in response to the success of some of his earlier works such as Crystallizing Public Opinion (1923) and A Public Relations Counsel (1927).   Propaganda explored the psychology behind manipulating masses and the ability to use symbolic action and propaganda to influence politics, effect social change, and lobby for gender and racial equality. Walter Lippman was Bernays’ unacknowledged American mentor and his work The Phantom Public greatly influenced the ideas expressed in Propaganda a year later. The work propelled Bernays into media historians’ view of him as the “father of public relations.”   I found this in /r/TheoryofPropaganda (h/t /u/vincentnash). Oh, and /u/derekpearcy posted links to the Adam Curtis documentary The Century of the Self, mentioned on the podcast:   The Century of the Self is a 2002 British television documentary series by Adam Curtis. It focuses on how the work of Sigmund Freud, Anna Freud, and Edward Bernays influenced the way corporations and governments have analyzed, dealt with, and controlled people."

From wikipedia:   Among the concepts that Tarde initiated were the group mind (taken up and developed by Gustave Le Bon, and sometimes advanced to explain so-called herd behaviour or crowd psychology), and economic psychology, where he anticipated a number of modern developments.Tarde was very critical of Émile Durkheim’s work at the level of both methodology and theory.[3] However, Durkheim's sociology overshadowed Tarde's insights, and it was not until U.S. scholars, such as the Chicago school, took up his theories that they became famous   Sigmund Freud's theory of the crowd is also believed to have been heavily influenced by Tarde's ideas."

HistoryofIdeas,2xcs9g,Qwill2,1 point,Fri Feb 27 14:45:18 2015 UTC,"Attitudes to astrology in early Christianity, a study based on selected sources  By Timothy Hegedus  Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Toronto, 2000   Abstract  Astrology was fundamental to the cultural and religious ” furniture”, as it were, of Greco-Roman society. The teachings and practice of astrology, its persistent popularity, and its close connections with other forms of pagan religion posed numerous challenges for early Christianity. It is therefore not surprising that the early Christians responded to astrology in a variety of ways. As in its dealings with other elements of Greco-Roman paganism, the range of early Christian responses to astrology was broad and multi-faceted. The object of the present study is to explore this variety by focussing on the treatment of astrology in a number of early Christian sources.  Part A examines the Christians’ negative reaction. On the one hand, they made use of stock anti-fatalist arguments which were available from Grew-Roman tradition such as criticisms of the precision of astrologer’s techniques; the argument that people with the same horoscope have different destinies; the argument that people with different horoscopes have common destinies; the argument from animals; and the moral argument. On the other hand the early Christians also generated new arguments against astrology which arose out of Christian belief and practice per se; a number of these are surveyed in Part A as well. The last section of Part A links at how early church authorities addressed the pastoral problem of people in the church who were consulting astrologers and/or practicing astrology.  Part B goes on to examine evidence of more benign and positive responses to astrology among the early Christians. Astrological themes are shown to convey Christian theological meanings in the Matthean story of the Magi and the star (Matt 2.1- 12) and in passages from the book of Revelation. The accommodations made to astrology by certain early Christian writers (Bardaisan, Tertullian, Pseudo-Clement, Origen, Zeno of Verona) and groups (the allegorizers of Aratus, the Peratae, the Elchasaites, and the Priscillianists) are also discussed in Part B."

There's bits where Marx leaves ideas undeveloped or even comes to conclusions that he'd later reject in Capital proper.

At issue are the source, forms and determinants of the magnitude of surplus-value, and Marx tries to explain how, after failing to solve basic contradictions in its labour theories of value, the classical school of political economy eventually broke up, leaving only ""vulgar political economy"" which no longer tried to provide a consistent, integral theory of capitalism, but instead offered only an eclectic amalgam of theories which seemed pragmatically useful or which justified the rationality of the market economy."

HistoryofIdeas,2w08qq,Qwill2,2,Sun Feb 15 21:14:19 2015 UTC,"Wikipedia on Max Weber:   Karl Emil Maximilian ""Max"" Weber (German: [ˈmaks ˈveːbɐ]; 21 April 1864 – 14 June 1920) was a German sociologist, philosopher, and political economist whose ideas influenced social theory, social research, and the entire discipline of sociology. Weber is often cited, with Émile Durkheim and Karl Marx, as among the three founding creators of sociology.  Weber was a key proponent of methodological antipositivism, arguing for the study of social action through interpretive (rather than purely empiricist) means, based on understanding the purpose and meaning that individuals attach to their own actions. Weber's main intellectual concern was understanding the processes of rationalisation, secularisation, and ""disenchantment"" that he associated with the rise of capitalism and modernity, and which he saw as the result of a new way of thinking about the world.   Wikipedia on Emile Durkheim:   David Émile Durkheim (April 15, 1858 – November 15, 1917) was a French sociologist, social psychologist and philosopher. He formally established the academic discipline and, with Karl Marx and Max Weber, is commonly cited as the principal architect of modern social science and father of sociology.  Much of Durkheim's work was concerned with how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in modernity; an era in which traditional social and religious ties are no longer assumed, and in which new social institutions have come into being. His first major sociological work was The Division of Labour in Society (1893). In 1895, he published The Rules of Sociological Method and set up the first European department of sociology, becoming France's first professor of sociology. In 1898, he established the journal L'Année Sociologique. Durkheim's seminal monograph, Suicide (1897), a study of suicide rates in Catholic and Protestant populations, pioneered modern social research and served to distinguish social science from psychology and political philosophy.

Weber is often cited, with Émile Durkheim and Karl Marx, as among the three founding creators of sociology.  Weber was a key proponent of methodological antipositivism, arguing for the study of social action through interpretive (rather than purely empiricist) means, based on understanding the purpose and meaning that individuals attach to their own actions. Weber's main intellectual concern was understanding the processes of rationalisation, secularisation, and ""disenchantment"" that he associated with the rise of capitalism and modernity, and which he saw as the result of a new way of thinking about the world.

HistoryofIdeas,2vir9y,Qwill2,2,Wed Feb 11 09:23:39 2015 UTC,"From the publisher's site:   Here, in a grand narrative spanning 1,800 years of European history, a distinguished political philosopher firmly rejects Western liberalism’s usual account of itself: its emergence in opposition to religion in the early modern era. Larry Siedentop argues instead that liberal thought is, in its underlying assumptions, the offspring of the Church. Beginning with a moral revolution in the first centuries CE, when notions about equality and human agency were first formulated by St. Paul, Siedentop follows these concepts in Christianity from Augustine to the philosophers and canon lawyers of the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, and ends with their reemergence in secularism—another of Christianity’s gifts to the West.  Inventing the Individual tells how a new, equal social role, the individual, arose and gradually displaced the claims of family, tribe, and caste as the basis of social organization. Asking us to rethink the evolution of ideas on which Western societies and government are built, Siedentop contends that the core of what is now the West’s system of beliefs emerged earlier than we commonly think. The roots of liberalism—belief in individual freedom, in the fundamental moral equality of individuals, in a legal system based on equality, and in a representative form of government befitting a society of free people—all these were pioneered by Christian thinkers of the Middle Ages who drew on the moral revolution carried out by the early Church. These philosophers and canon lawyers, not the Renaissance humanists, laid the foundation for liberal democracy in the West."

That’s it for comets, their bit part in the drama that is the unfolding of the astronomical revolution is over and done with, don’t call us we’ll call you.   The problem with this mythological account is that it vastly over emphasises the role of both Tycho and the 1577 comet in changing the view of the heavens and vastly under rates the role played by comets and their observations in the evolution of the new astronomy in the Early Modern Period.   I shall deal with the crystalline spheres and their dissolution in a separate post and for now will follow the trail of the comets as they weave their way through the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries changing our perceptions of the heavens and driving the evolution of the new astronomy.

The Greeks had steam power, it didn't cause an 'industrial revolution' for the simply reason that they didn't need it (the conditions were different) because they had slaves (down the mines etc.). Science is the product of certain conditions and only results in certain phenomenon under certain conditions. It wasn't the mere existence of sophisticated metallurgical techniques, steam power and so on that made the industrial revolution it was their utilisations and development by capitalists. It's only under specific historical conditions that the logic of capitalist accumulation arises and harnesses scientific advances for their own ends, in the process advancing science for further capital expansion. Advanced farming techniques only existed because capitalist farmers realised the accumulative possibilities of land which had been previously unrecognised, with feudal lords retaining stagnant technology for the simply reason they didn't need, or see, land as a source of profit.

It was not ever so. In 1945, Germany lay in ruins, literally, not to mention ethically and existentially. And much of its population, in that moment, given the chance, would very likely have chosen to return the Nazis to power.  Sean Forner is Associate Professor of History at Michigan State University. His book, German Intellectuals and the Challenge of Democratic Renewal: Culture and Politics after 1945 (Cambridge University Press, 2014), deals with that moment in Germany just after the Second World War, when a network of individuals he calls engaged democrats emerged. These individuals occupied a range of political positions, but all shared a dream of a Germany that would be both committed to democracy, and beholden neither to West nor East. That part of their project—creating a Germany between the incipient polarities of the Cold War—was not to be, but the engaged democrats of the immediate post-1945 era are nonetheless a highly significant part of the transformation that arguably helped to create—or lay the foundations for—the Germany of today."

The widening cycles of reprisals make a lot more sense of you consider the history from, say, the June Days of 1848 through Louis Napoleon's coup d'état and the repressions that followed, then the Paris Commune, with its bloody week and the deportations that followed. Ravachol's trials followed closely on the heels of the lois scélérates, which started by restricting speech and went on to essentially criminalize even peaceful anarchist activity. The French government arguably gave much better than it got, when it came to violence and the promotion of terror, through that whole period. Still, even Ravachol was fairly unpopular at first among many anarchists. The myth of Ravachol as ""the violent Christ of anarchy"" would have been impossible without the contributions of the government and the press, as well as the anarchists and Ravachol himself. (He was indeed, by his own account, a shepherd boy doomed to become a martyr, but it takes more than that to turn a criminal into a kind of radical messiah.) With Ravachol's second conviction and death sentence, the cycle clearly became one of reprisals on both sides, and the fact that Emile Henry's act essentially broke the cycle suggests how unready most everyone involved was to adopt anything like terrorism as a tactic."

HistoryofIdeas,2u4bef,Qwill2,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:35:47 2015 UTC,"Abstract:  The “privacy paradox” refers to the discrepancy between the concern individuals express for their privacy and the apparently low value they actually assign to it when they readily trade personal information for low-value goods online. In this paper, I argue that the privacy paradox masks a more important paradox: the self-management model of privacy embedded in notice-and-consent pages on websites and other, analogous practices can be readily shown to underprotect privacy, even in the economic terms favored by its advocates. The real question, then, is why privacy self-management occupies such a prominent position in privacy law and regulation.   Borrowing from Foucault’s late writings, I argue that this failure to protect privacy is also a success in ethical subject formation, as it actively pushes privacy norms and practices in a neoliberal direction. In other words, privacy self-management isn’t about protecting people’s privacy; it’s about inculcating the idea that privacy is an individual, commodified good that can be traded for other market goods.   Along the way, the self-management regime forces privacy into the market, obstructs the functioning of other, more social, understandings of privacy, and occludes the various ways that individuals attempt to resist adopting the market-based view of themselves and their privacy. Throughout, I use the analytics practices of Facebook and social networking sites as a sustained case study of the point."

This rejection allowed da Vinci, the scientist and artist, to question the inherent intricacies of light and optics, and marry the complexities of reflection with the complexities of visual perception.

He criticized the expansion and development of modern rationalism and was an apologist of classical antiquity. Vico is best known for his magnum opus, the Scienza Nuova of 1725, often published in English as New Science.  Vico is a precursor of systemic and complexity thinking, as opposed to Cartesian analysis and other kinds of reductionism. He is also well known for noting that verum esse ipsum factum (""true itself is fact"" or ""the true itself is made""), a proposition that has been read as an early instance of constructivist epistemology.  Vico is often claimed to have inaugurated modern philosophy of history, although the term is not found in his text (Vico speaks of a ""history of philosophy narrated philosophically"").

By the time the 'loi de 22 Prairial, year II"" was enacted in France (i.e. the law of June 10th 1794 which granted extraordinary powers to the Revolutionary Tribunals and enabled the batch condemnations which were at the heart of the Great Terror) Robespierre's Jacobin faction were not only solidly positioned at the centre of power, but their French military had completely quashed the counter-revolutionary forces and their foreign collaborators in Nantes and northern provinces and were pushing back the counter-revolutionary forces in the southern and southeastern provinces.   In fact, the Jacobins were at their strongest precisely at that moment in French history. If there was fear, it was fear in the rest of Europe that the slogans of the revolution might spread beyond the french borders. Consider the measures enacted in Britain to breakup and incarcerate any members of pro-Republican clubs or Workers Associations (EP Thompson ""The Making of the English Working Class"", Ken Johnson's ""Unusual Suspects""see http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199657803.do; the trial of English Actor Thomas Holcroft, and the harassement of WIlliam Blake and again of Samuel Taylor Colerige, which uncovers merely the tip of that anti-Jacobin iceberg).  The real question concerning this phase of the Terror (i.e. 1793 - 1794, known as the Great Terror; as opposed to say 1792 - 1793 or 1794 - 1795, which are known merely as the Terror) was WHY did the Jacobin's and, in particular, WHY did Robespierre & Couthon feel it necessary at the time to propose and implement such a law (against even the better judgement of a substantial segment of their supporters) which essentially put the very mechanisms for their faction's demise into the hands of their rivals? That their rivals were expeditious in using these measures to bring Robespierre, St Just, Couthon and the rest of the petite bourgeois' who made up the brain trust of the Jacobin Club and the Committee for Public Safety to the guillotine, is shown by the mere seven weeks it took them to topple the party which controlled the direction of the revolution.   I do not have the answer to that question, but I believe it is important to have it raised. Without an answer to that question, we can not understand the Great Terror.

The object of this exploration of Popper’s work in political theory is to identify its most distinctive features, to comment on its relationship with the philosophy of science, and to evaluate its contribution to some of the central problem-areas of contemporary political thought.      Wikipedia on Popper:   Sir Karl Raimund Popper CH FBA FRS (28 July 1902 – 17 September 1994) was an Austrian philosopher and professor. He is generally regarded as one of the greatest philosophers of science of the 20th century.  Popper is known for his rejection of the classical inductivist views on the scientific method, in favour of empirical falsification: A theory in the empirical sciences can never be proven, but it can be falsified, meaning that it can and should be scrutinised by decisive experiments. If the outcome of an experiment contradicts the theory, one should refrain from ad hoc manoeuvres that evade the contradiction merely by making it less falsifiable.   Popper is also known for his opposition to the classical justificationist account of knowledge which he replaced with critical rationalism, ""the first non-justificational philosophy of criticism in the history of philosophy.""   In political discourse, he is known for his vigorous defence of liberal democracy and the principles of social criticism that he came to believe made a flourishing ""open society"" possible. His political philosophy embraces ideas from all major democratic political ideologies and attempts to reconcile them: social democracy, classical liberalism and conservatism, more explicitly so in his later years.

From his perspective you would think population density only leads to problems; dramatic health problems, class divisions, longer working hours. He mentions that agricultural societies could have outfought ""healthy bushmen"" by sheet weight of numbers. As if volume alone is the benefit of having more people.  We only need to look to the other differences between agricultural societies and hunter-gatherer ones to see the benefits. Namely the division of labour, and through it, all of civilisation itself. Architecture, engineering, writing, mathematics - these special disciplines pop out only because of agriculture, because stationary farmers needed houses, tool and machines, and ways to keep track of resources and trades, and can provide enough surplus food that someone else can do these jobs. And maybe such a way of life is what lead to warfare, and pestilence, and famine at times. Perhaps hunter gatherers don't have any similar crises. But let's not forget the author sat there on his computer at LA Medical School, using a device connecting him instantly to millions of other humans, from a climate controlled office in a gigantic structure, sitting in the middle of one of the largest cities in the world, in a country that put people on the moon, typing up an article that draws on the work of thousands of archaeologists and scientists over 100's of years.

HistoryofIdeas,2rz11r,Qwill2,2,Sat Jan 10 16:34:42 2015 UTC,"Abstract  Hume developed an original and revolutionary theoretical paradigm for explaining the spontaneous emergence of the classic conventions of justice — stable possession, transference of property by consent, and the obligation to fulﬁll promises. In a scenario of scarce external resources, Hume’s central idea is that the development of the rules of justice responds to a sense of common interest that progressively tames the destructiveness of natural self-love and expands the action of natural moral sentiments.   By handling conceptual tools that anticipated game theory for centuries, Hume was able to break with rationalism, the natural law school, and Hobbes’s contractarianism. Unlike natural moral sentiments, the sense of justice is valuable and reaches full strength within a general plan or system of actions.   However, unlike game theory, Hume does not assume that people have transparent access to the their own motivations and the inner structure of the social world. In contrast, he blends ideas such as cognitive delusion, learning by experience and coordination to construct a theory that still deserves careful discussion, even though it resists classiﬁcation under contemporary headings.

Dismaying that this person managed to complete a Ph.D. in literature without acquiring the ability to read. Or perhaps (to be more interpretively charitable with him than he is with Emerson) he's a better reader of some other kind of text. He's certainly quite clueless here, though."
HistoryofIdeas,2rzbh9,Vaucanson,6,Sat Jan 10 18:55:30 2015 UTC,"I had to stop reading when the author tried to discredit Emerson's concepts of nature and the soul by pointing out that they differ from our common definitions. Oh, ya think? That is literally the core of the transcendentalist movement that he is dismissing, just because he can't wrap his inflexible little head around it. Emerson's philosophy, while not always rigorous, is well established within what Aldous Huxley called ""the perennial philosophy"", which concludes that individual consciousness and subjective experience are but subphenomenon to the larger unmanifest, indivisible ground of being. Taoists call it Tao, Hindus call it Nirguna Brahman, Eckhart called it the Godhead, and Emerson calls it the Oversoul. In writing off Emerson's beautiful and personal description, he manages to write off a metaphysics that has developed independently across the world and throughout human history.  As far as his prose, anyone who fails to understand why Emerson is revered need only read the first two pages of self reliance. The author of piece should be applauded for ""speaking his latent conviction,"" in this instance though, that conviction is pretty much uninformed bullshit."
HistoryofIdeas,2rzbh9,soforth,2,Sat Jan 10 20:59:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, ""ya think?"" is the exact right reaction. Of the several so-stupid-it's-inadvertently-funny things this guy does as a reader, perhaps the funniest is his repeated complaint that Emerson uses words in nonstandard or surprising ways. (Ya think?) Basically everything that Mattix says ""lacks control,"" metaphorically or otherwise, in Emerson is in fact (at least in my opinion as a reader who's spent decades returning to these texts) so finely, carefully controlled and considered that Mattix, apparently deaf to subtlety, has just missed it entirely.   It's ultimately a pretty funny essay, and indeed my LOL was a real one, because Mattix so perfectly and consistently demonstrates not Emerson's failures but his own."

HistoryofIdeas,2rrfky,Jacques_Ellul,2,Thu Jan 8 17:35:50 2015 UTC,"I would put this along side Lippmann's 'Public Opinion' and Bernay's 'Propaganda' as the three most important original source books on the subject. This was Harold Lasswell's (one of the founders of modern political science and communications) dissertation and it represents a comprehensive analysis/theory of propaganda.  Some of the chapters include, 'War Guilt and War Aims,' 'Satanism,' 'The Illusion of Victory,' 'Demoralizing the Enemy,' among others.  Of course any book on propaganda from this era typically suffered from over stated determinism and the magic bullet fallacy.  This book is no exception.  From goodreads.com   This classic book on propaganda technique focuses on American, British, French, and German experience in World War I. The book sets forth a simple classification of various psychological materials used to produce certain specific results and proposes a general theory of strategy and tactics for the manipulation of these materials.In an introduction (coauthored by Jackson A. Giddens) written for this edition, Harold Lasswell notes that this study was partially an exercise in the discovery of appropriate theory. It raised the crucial questions of how to classify the content of propaganda--for instance, a distinction is made between ""value demands"" (war aims, war guilt, and casting the enemy as evil personified) and ""expectations"" (the illusion of victory)--and how to summarize the procedures employed in organizing and carrying out propaganda operations. Propaganda Technique in World War I deals primarily with problems of internal administration and lateral coordination rather than with the relationship between policymakers and propagandists. However, Jackson Giddens enumerates procedures in the book that illustrate an underlying assumption that decision makers were deeply involved in propaganda and influenced by considerations of public opinion. He takes the study of propaganda further by elaborating on the nature and meaning of the category of ""war aims"" and its relation to the propagandist, for this, more than any other category of content, ""is the catalyst of transnational political action."" Giddens's exploration of the development of a comprehensive theory of propaganda adds another dimension to Lasswell's study while confirming its value as outstanding groundwork for continuing research."

Imagine how different life could have been in ancient Greece, Rome, and the empires that followed if the technology behind the gearing of the Antikythera mechanism had taken root and come into common usage. That would have changed history!  Also, just from reading a bit on Amazon, I have to say I'm a little put off by how you personify inventions, talking somewhat fancifully about them willing themselves into existence, feeling bored, etc. To me this seems to obscure the realities of the process of discovery -- and in particular the very interesting question of why sometimes inventions take off and why at other times they fade into obscurity. This has nothing to do with them ""bowing out"" or ""going underground,"" biding their time until conditions are more accepting.  All that said, maybe this is a matter of audience: the available intro reads like it might be of interest to kids, so maybe that's the target market.

He is considered one of the first exponents of utilitarianism, and the first modern proponent of anarchism.   Godwin is most famous for two books that he published within the space of a year: An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, an attack on political institutions, and Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams, which attacks aristocratic privilege, but also is the first mystery novel. Based on the success of both, Godwin featured prominently in the radical circles of London in the 1790s.   In the ensuing conservative reaction to British radicalism, Godwin was attacked, in part because of his marriage to the pioneering feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft in 1797 and his candid biography of her after her death; their daughter, Mary Godwin (later Mary Shelley) would go on to write Frankenstein and marry the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley."

HistoryofIdeas,2qvvjr,Amygdaled,3,Wed Dec 31 20:03:04 2014 UTC,"It was written during the U.S. presidential election in 2008 (in which Barack Obama defeated John McCain a few months later), so yes, it was intended for American readers who were interested in political trends.  ""Left"" and ""Right"" have particular meanings in American political discourse that may be a little different than in other countries. Here is a very rough history that explains the background of the article: *Since the birth of the U.S.A. there has been debate over which should have more power: the central ""federal"" government, or the separate state (provincial) and local governments.   *During the Great Depression (1929-1941 in the U.S.), the Democratic Party led by President Franklin D. Roosevelt expanded the role and power of the central government in new ways. He did this with the goal of helping the poor and unemployed. These ideas became known as ""liberal"" or moderately Left. His opponents (on the Right) thought it was a very bad idea for the central government to have so much control over businesses and state governments. But overall, Roosevelt got his way.  *In some ways, the central government has never been reduced since the 1930s. The changes that Roosevelt made have become normal.  *From the victory in World War II until about the mid-1960s, there was not much difference between the two main political parties. This is known as the postwar consensus. At that time, the economy was very strong, and the Cold War against the Soviet Union encouraged unity.  *As in many countries, there were very large social, cultural, and political changes in the late 1960s, which is the time that this article is discussing. In the U.S., the most important political issues included equal rights for black Americans, and the American war in Vietnam.  ""The New Left"" refers to groups started by university students and other young people in the late 1960s. The most famous group was the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). In general, these groups were very strongly *in favor of equal rights for black Americans (which meant that they supported the central government in protecting black citizens against racist local governments) and completely against the war in Vietnam (which was, of course, the responsibility of the same central government). The New Left actually did not have a lot of influence on the government at that time, but in later decades, it did. Barack Obama was not born until 1961, but the article says he has been influenced by some of the New Left leaders, such as Bill Ayers. The New Left was not afraid to be associated with communism, but the Old Left (in the 1930s-1950s) was against communism.  *""The New Right"" also developed in the late 1960s. Interestingly, some young members of the New Right agreed with the Left on a few issues. The main idea of the New Right was that government had grown too large and powerful ever since President Roosevelt in the 1930s. The New Right was also extremely anti-communist. The New Right did not have much power in the U.S. until Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980.  *Today, the American Right (which The American Conservative magazine is a part of) thinks of itself as anti-central government, pro-capitalist, and pro-individual liberty. The Right thinks that Barack Obama supports socialism and is, in some ways, anti-American. The gap between Left and Right is very large in the U.S. today.  *The point of the article, then, is to remind the reader that Left and Right actually could agree on some things! For example, they both supported giving power to local communities, and wanted to de-centralize decision making as much as possible.  I hope this does not add to your confusion."

The Stoics taught that destructive emotions resulted from errors in judgment, and that a sage, or person of ""moral and intellectual perfection"", would not suffer such emotions.  Stoics were concerned with the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, and the belief that it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy as a way of life, and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how that person behaved.

For all of their differences, the two thinkers belonged to the same spiritual family, that of European liberalism broadly defined, a common cultural and political universe placing special emphasis upon individual liberty, dignity, and human excellence.   We begin the paper by commenting on the struggle between civilization and barbarism, a fundamental topic in Ortega and Aron’s writings. Preserving the values of civilization was one of the main reasons for their involvement in the public life of their countries. Next, we turn to the concept of “critical spectatorship” central to their writings and comment on the similarities and differences between their visions on this issue.   We conclude by drawing a few conclusions on the relevance of Ortega and Aron’s types of social and political criticism for us today."

In fact revolutionary socialists and Marxists played a major role, for example People's Mujahedin of Iran. It's simply self-serving history to transform the revolution into essentially an inevitable pre-confirmed victory for Khomeni, and thus simply a populace clamouring for an assertive Islamism. He arguable only won the struggle between opposition groups due to the propaganda coup of gaining the US embassy. For a good and interesting analysis of that revolution, and the 'rise of Islamism' more generally, see Chris Harman's The prophet and the proletariat  2) John Gray's transformation of Stalinism and Nazism into essentially religions is historically problematic and self-serving. Belief and religion aren't synonymous. Given that he also mentions a distinction between secular and religious beliefs, he seems to display cognitive dissonance.   3) Also the ideology of ISIS is not Wahhabism. It's hard to talk of a singular 'Wahhabism'; that ideology has changed and split many times since the 18th C. here's a good history of Wahhabism which acknowledges the changes to it when institutionalised in the Saudi state.

In the first semester, we build a Marxist theoretical tradition by laying out and then showing the weaknesses of Marx and Engels, weaknesses that are successively addressed by Lenin, Gramsci and Fanon. For each theorist history throws up particular anomalies and contradiction in the writings of their predecessors. In this way theory lives on as an ever-expanding tradition.

As an intellectual, Fanon was a political radical, and an existentialist humanist concerning the psychopathology of colonization, and the human, social, and cultural consequences of decolonization.  In the course of his work as a physician and psychiatrist, Fanon supported the Algerian War of Independence from France, and was a member of the Algerian National Liberation Front.

Is there something about the Islamic heritage that makes Muslims more likely than adherents of other faiths to invoke it in their political life? If so, what is it? Ancient Religions, Modern Politics seeks to answer these questions by examining the roles of Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity in modern political life, placing special emphasis on the relevance—or irrelevance—of their heritages to today’s social and political concerns.  Michael Cook takes an in-depth, comparative look at political identity, social values, attitudes to warfare, views about the role of religion in various cultural domains, and conceptions of the polity. In all these fields he finds that the Islamic heritage offers richer resources for those engaged in current politics than either the Hindu or the Christian heritages. He uses this finding to explain the fact that, despite the existence of Hindu and Christian counterparts to some aspects of Islamism, the phenomenon as a whole is unique in the world today. The book also shows that fundamentalism—in the sense of a determination to return to the original sources of the religion—is politically more adaptive for Muslims than it is for Hindus or Christians.  A sweeping comparative analysis by one of the world’s leading scholars of premodern Islam, Ancient Religions, Modern Politics sheds important light on the relationship between the foundational texts of these three great religious traditions and the politics of their followers today.

His work is marked by lucid prose, awareness of social injustice, opposition to totalitarianism, and commitment to democratic socialism.  Commonly ranked as one of the most influential English writers of the 20th century, and as one of the most important chroniclers of English culture of his generation, Orwell wrote literary criticism, poetry, fiction, and polemical journalism. He is best known for the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) and the allegorical novella Animal Farm (1945). His book Homage to Catalonia (1938), an account of his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, is widely acclaimed, as are his numerous essays on politics, literature, language, and culture. In 2008, The Times ranked him second on a list of ""The 50 greatest British writers since 1945"".  Orwell's work continues to influence popular and political culture, and the term Orwellian — descriptive of totalitarian or authoritarian social practices — has entered the language together with several of his neologisms, including cold war, Big Brother, thought police, Room 101, doublethink, and thoughtcrime.

HistoryofIdeas,2ojwi3,TheShowIsNotTheShow,2,Sun Dec 7 14:55:59 2014 UTC,"From Neil Postman's influential, if outdated, analysis Amusing Ourselves to Death:   We were keeping our eye on 1984. When the year came and the prophecy didn't, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares. But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell's dark vision, there was another - slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.  What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny ""failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions"". In 1984, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.  This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.   http://zaklynsky.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/postman-neil-amusing-ourselves-to-death-public-discourse-in-the-age-of-show-business.pdf"

Though We could theoretically prove or disprove any theory as the article states, I would add that no one person can prove or disprove all human knowledge so we will always have to assume at least some things are true without actually finding that out for ourselves.

This links with a general critique of materialism, conjoined as we know with Marxist critique of capitalism.   So in envolution, this ""original"" basis is seen as being itself a symptom of meta-physics (which means physics-first). The account is already leaving out a whole dimension that is thriving: criminal justice and associated issues (war/defense), morality and some sense of general justice, in particular, as retributive justice and the pitting of forces.   Justice configures everyday epistemology to receive its fruits and ground its truth, and this configuration plays back into the hands of production, the state, etc., not to mention the commodification movements (up to this day).  There is a freezing in particular of thought, or else it is relegated to ""theory"" (the academy) while a crude division is observed unquestioningly between thought and action. Nonviolence remains undeveloped, unthematic and uninteresting.   The coming to of envolutionary nonviolence thoughtaction can happen anywhere, but it is not especially event driven. Rather, it sees its task as one of awakening to events on the thought end, because the events are known to be there (social injustice). As long as it is event drive, it remains reactionary, which means thought has not found its legs.   His impulse to movements and revolution is good. But it has to work in the above (very thumbnailed) way."

He draws on Ronald Dworkin's Religion Without God to distinguish between the ""scientific"" claims that religions make (what Christians would call theology and history) and their claims about ""values."" He dismisses the ""scientific"" claims of religions and doubtless many of the specific value claims of religions.   But Watson thinks that the theological claims of religions do not really connect to their value claims. Though Science and Reason might disprove theistic religions, they do not do away with the need for religion itself. It is possible and desirable to have a religion apart from God.   Concerning the form and content that an atheist way of life might take, Watson's resounding answer is art.

HistoryofIdeas,2nuepr,Qwill2,2,Sun Nov 30 14:14:49 2014 UTC,"Abstract:  Most people would not describe Christian monks as militaristic. However, there are instances in history when Christians have strayed from their basic pacifist beliefs in the name of defending their religion. The most famous example of this would be the Military Orders of the medieval Crusades, when full scale war was encouraged by the Catholic Church in order to protect the Holy Land.   These militant monks formed a new breed of religious organization where brothers were soldiers willing die defending Christianity against the infidel. Although the Order of the Temple, or the Templars, was the most infamous of the Orders, the Order of St. John, or the Hospitallers, was also highly influential. Both came to wield immense power in the twelfth century, despite their counterintuitive identity as religious warriors. Yet it is precisely their contradictory nature that makes them so intriguing.   Although they were devout members of a pacifist religion, they were also its dominant military force. By the most basic tenants of Christianity, the Military Orders should never have existed. It is the goal of this paper to uncover the various factors that allowed for their ascendancy through the analysis of primary sources and secondary research.   The rise to power of the Military Orders was due to shifts in religious military thought, acquisition of immense wealth through donations from prestigious patrons, ecclesiastical privileges, and a military need in the Crusader states."

We treat every day as if there would assuredly be another to follow. We view time as if it were an unlimited resource rather than a restricted commodity.  Seneca continues by telling us that we not only refuse to accept our limited time, but that we waste away what little time we do possess. The philosopher declares that we shackle ourselves to our labors, our professions.  Whether we are laborers or emperors, we willingly give parts of ourselves to others or to the faceless masses. And at the end of our days, we might drop dead while calling on a customer or arguing before a court. We will die as if we were children, never having learned how to live."

Seneca generally employed a pointed rhetorical style. His writings expose traditional themes of Stoic philosophy: the universe is governed for the best by a rational providence; contentment is achieved through a simple, unperturbed life in accordance with nature and duty to the state; human suffering should be accepted and has a beneficial effect on the soul; study and learning are important. He emphasized practical steps by which the reader might confront life's problems. In particular, he considered it important to confront one's own mortality. The discussion of how to approach death dominates many of his letters.  De Brevitate Vitae (frequently referred to as On the Shortness of Life in English) is a moral essay written by Seneca (...) to his friend Paulinus. The philosopher brings up many Stoic principles on the nature of time, namely that men waste much of it in meaningless pursuits. According to the essay, nature gives man enough time to do what is really important and the individual must allot it properly. In general, time can be best used in the study of philosophy, according to Seneca.   More posts about Seneca or on Stoicism."

For example, it is commonly claimed that Damaris Masham held her philosophical view because of her Cambridge platonist father and Locke. This view, on the other hand, is obviously naive; virtually all philosophers are influenced by others.

The most important of the ‘classical pragmatists’ were Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914), William James (1842–1910) and John Dewey (1859–1952).   The influence of pragmatism declined during the first two thirds of the twentieth century, but it has undergone a revival since the 1970s with philosophers being increasingly willing to use the writings and ideas of the classical pragmatists, and also a number of thinkers, such as Richard Rorty, Hilary Putnam and Robert Brandom developing philosophical views that represent later stages of the pragmatist tradition.   The core of pragmatism was the pragmatist maxim, a rule for clarifying the contents of hypotheses by tracing their ‘practical consequences’. In the work of Peirce and James, the most influential application of the pragmatist maxim was to the concept of truth. But the pragmatists have also tended to share a distinctive epistemological outlook, a fallibilist anti-Cartesian approach to the norms that govern inquiry.   More posts relevant to pragmatism.

The essay argues that any tyrant remains in power until his subjects grant him that, therefore delegitimizing every form of power.

HistoryofIdeas,2n98ec,NotReallySpartacus,19,Mon Nov 24 11:48:51 2014 UTC,"Love Dostoevsky, but I really don't like this. My list of complaints:  1. First, the title is basically click-bait. Dostoevsky didn't foresee totalitarianism, he ""foresaw"" that turning your back on God and embracing positivism would lead to tyranny. In my opinion that's a pretty poor analysis of what actually went wrong in the Soviet Union.  2. ""The 19th Century Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky wrote about characters who justified murder in the name of their ideological beliefs."" As opposed to non-ideological beliefs? There is one alternative to this: pacifism. If you think killing is ever justified, as the vast majority of people do, this sentence describes you. That isn't a bad thing. John Gray's attempt to pin this charge on Communists and Neocons just shows that the values and predictions that people use to justify the use of force depend on certain assumptions that others might reject.  3. ""Nechaev had authored a pamphlet, The Catechism of a Revolutionary, which argued that any means (including blackmail and murder) could be used to advance the cause of revolution."" gasp, not blackmail? Alright, here's a prime example. If you have reason to believe a Revolution would lead to enormous improvements in quality of life, are you honestly telling me it would be moral to refrain from blackmail? This criticism also applies just as well to status-quo powers such as the tsars, who obviously used murder and coercion to maintain their grip on power (this article starts with a mock-execution and forced labor for planning to spread your viewpoint, right?), so revolutionaries are not the only ones to be more pragmatic than dogmatic when it comes to morality.  3. ""As one of the characters in Demons confesses: ""I got entangled in my own data, and my conclusion directly contradicts the original idea from which I start. From unlimited freedom, I conclude with unlimited despotism."" Indeed a wonderful sentence, but this is a scene from a horror story, not a convincing critique of consequentialism.   4. ""Dostoyevsky suggests that the result of abandoning morality for the sake of an idea of freedom will be a type of tyranny more extreme than any in the past."" Ah yes, strategic bombing ushered in a hundred years of enslavement in Europe...oh wait.  5. ""What Dostoyevsky diagnosed - and at times suffered from himself - was the tendency to think of ideas as being somehow more real than actual human beings."" The point, of course, is that ideas have a tremendous effect on how real people actually live. Whether implementing a given idea will cause more harm than good is of course a matter of debate, but to totally reject the notion of doing such a calculation is a cowardly abdication of responsibility and one I doubt that the author would really advocate if his treasured ideas such as the sanctity of the individual were under serious threat at home. He also admits here that his portrait of Dostoevsky is a bit unfaithful--the man believed fervently in certain ideas, just not ideas that could justify violence without being perverted.   5. Finally, the last paragraph:   We've come to imagine that ideas like ""democracy"", ""human rights and ""freedom"" have a power of their own, which can transform the lives of anyone who is exposed to them. We've launched projects of regime change, which aim to realise these ideas by toppling tyrants. But exporting revolution in this fashion can have the effect of fracturing the state, as has happened in Libya, Syria and Iraq, leading to civil war, anarchy and new types of tyranny.   Is the problem that ""we"" criminally misjudged the situation in the Middle East, or that interfering in a country's sovereignty is morally wrong and that abandoning moral means leads inexorably to tragedy? These are two totally different arguments and its important not to confuse the second, which is Dostoevsky's, with the first, which is held by anyone who's been paying attention. Would the author level the same criticisms at the American invasion of Grenada, which succeeded in restoring liberal democracy, or is chasing grand ideas such as freedom wrong only when it fails?"

Was he a convinced believer, brought to a new understanding of God and the world by his own Damascene moment? And, if so, what exactly did he believe in? Or was he a pragmatist who saw his in new religious affiliation great opportunities for cementing both his own authority and the stability of the Empire he controlled?   This lecture will explore the nature of religious affiliation more generally in the world of the later Roman Empire, and use it to offer new perspectives both on the received narratives of Constantine’s conversion, and the broader process by which Christianity turned itself, as a result, from minority sect to world religion.

Mclaren said that, despite the commentary of medieval thinkers like St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, common people and pilgrims nonetheless regarded relics of saints and martyrs as items to be worshiped for their qualities:  ""Though medieval theologians made sure to separate relic veneration from worship, it is likely that most medieval Europeans did not think similarly. Rather, they worshiped the relics and reliquaries like idols in order to fulfill personal wants because, as uneducated believers, they did not know the thoughts of the elite theologians.""   In his conclusion, however, Mclaren brings up the fact that  ""Relics in the medieval world were unquestioned because of their justification by medieval theologians such as St. Augustine, St. John of Damascus, and St. Thomas Aquinas.""  I am wondering if this is a contradiction in an explanation of the influence that medieval theologians had over people and their view of the faith? My meaning being, is it possible that these thinkers could endorse the use of relics and have that endorsement respected by the medieval world, but NOT have the nature of relic use also respected? It seems that the wider populace would value these views on relics, as Mclaren explained, yet I am curious to know where the potency of Augustine and Aquinas' arguments stop. It seemed that they could definitely understand the opinions of these thinkers, but not also understand that they should not be made powerful icons to be worshiped alone?   Just a thought..."

Watkins thinks these alternative narratives all speak to important philosophical interests in the modern period, but considered individually they tell only a partial story. The notion of order, he claims, can provide a broader narrative capable of incorporating many of the insights of the other narratives.

He argued that fundamental concepts structure human experience, and that reason is the source of morality. His thought continues to have a major influence in contemporary thought, especially the fields of metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics.  (...)  Kant discusses the subjective nature of aesthetic qualities and experiences in Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime, (1764). Kant's contribution to aesthetic theory is developed in the Critique of Judgment (1790) where he investigates the possibility and logical status of ""judgments of taste.""   In the ""Critique of Aesthetic Judgment,"" the first major division of the Critique of Judgment, Kant used the term ""aesthetic"" in a manner that, according to Kant scholar W.H. Walsh, differs from its modern sense. Prior to this, in the Critique of Pure Reason, to note essential differences between judgments of taste, moral judgments, and scientific judgments, Kant abandoned the term ""aesthetic"" as ""designating the critique of taste,"" noting that judgments of taste could never be ""directed"" by ""laws a priori"".   After A. G. Baumgarten, who wrote Aesthetica (1750–58), Kant was one of the first philosophers to develop and integrate aesthetic theory into a unified and comprehensive philosophical system, utilizing ideas that played an integral role throughout his philosophy.

Also, in its design it seeks to resolve most of lives issues in a simple and digestible way (Enchiridion of Epictetus). The whole concept puts control squarely in the individuals hands. Which can be liberating to an individual in todays world where we are told constantly that happiness lies in money and spending it. This is the final reason why I think it has come back in recent years. Due to recession many people have no expendable money so are forced to look for alternative solutions."

I don't think many modern day psychiatrists would consider regularly contemplating your own death, and the deaths of your loved ones, to be good for your mental health.   Secondly, a basis of stoicism is the idea of fate - that there are things you cannot control because ""the gods"" decide them, not you. This is a supernatural idea.  Furthermore, I believe telling people that suicide is always an option is not an ethical position.   People these days like to make fun of homeopathy and its ilk, but I believe if you are going to be intellectually consistent you should also reject ideas like Stoicism. The Ancient Greeks were very clever people, but they did not have the benefit of science and our understanding of how the mind works.   I don't think it is entirely coincidental that one of the founders of Stoicism was forced to kill himself in front of his family by one of his students - it contains a lot of ideas that are frankly sociopathic.

HistoryofIdeas,2mjpxa,therationalparent,7,Mon Nov 17 17:47:29 2014 UTC,"You can't reject a whole domain of thought (Stoicism) because a part of it is superstitious (gods' fate). A modern interpretation is that these gods just represent physical forces beyond your control, and a good Stoic gets started by training himself to control his own emotions and behaviors, while not getting all bent out of shape about things he cannot control.       And as for your critique that ""I don't think many modern day psychiatrists would consider regularly contemplating your own death, and the deaths of your loved ones, to be good for your mental health"" and that ""telling people that suicide is always an option is not an ethical position"".      Those are fair points, in context, and unfair out of context. In the context where it is given, it's a pretty pro-life message. It preaches that happiness can be found even in situations where life throws you tons of shit (this is Epictetus the freed slave talking). It basically preaches realism and cogency about one's own attitudes. Of course suicide's always an option and death is an inevitability, it would be delusion to consider otherwise. Stoics face that courageously and give up on the taboo that if you don't talk about it then you won't be sad. Stoicism isn't for cowards, but it isn't preachy--people will self-select for more of the Stoic message if they like it and proceed no further if it's too heavy for their taste."

In the context where it is given, it's a pretty pro-life message.    From The Enchiridion: ""The will of nature may be learned from those things in which we don't distinguish from each other. For example, when our neighbor's boy breaks a cup, or the like, we are presently ready to say, ""These things will happen."" Be assured, then, that when your own cup likewise is broken, you ought to be affected just as when another's cup was broken. Apply this in like manner to greater things. Is the child or wife of another dead? There is no one who would not say, ""This is a human accident."" but if anyone's own child happens to die, it is presently, ""Alas I how wretched am I!""

From The Enchiridion      I consider myself a little bit like a Stoic. Read and meditated on the Enchiridion for months. I feel strongly that you can't sincerely read Epictetus as a whole and think that his point is that your loved ones are trivial and do not matter.       Sure, he wants people who are upset to settle down, not because it doesn't matter, but because it does. It matters how you react to how you can act. Despondent sad people can fall into alcoholism and self-centered mourning, or they can take a deep breath and be a competent helper for others that are mourning near you. Being calm is a prerequisite for being the bigger man in a quarrel and settling the situation down. Being calm is a prerequisite for being a good policeman. Being calm is a prerequisite for, or at least of benefit to, all the classical Greek virtues. Know the limits of your knowledge (Socrates), know the limits of your power (Epictetus), and then you are both wise, humble, and somehow endowed with different capabilities than you had before, running around caught up in selfish little games designed to manipulate others into giving you money and attention.

I don't find that the god or fate element of Stoicism restricts the usefulness of the philosophy.  Stoic philosophy was initially set out in 300bc. I keep that in mind when interpreting the teachings. So I can adapt some of the supernatural elements without concern that I am missing the point.  I don't accept the god or fate element. But I do accept the idea of cause and effect. I also accept the idea that each day is filled with an infinite amount of variables over which I have absolutely zero control over.   For example: I can prepare for a business critical task. I can cross check. I can reconfirm numbers. I can do every thing which is in my power (thoughts & actions). But if my computer dies at the last moment or I get into a car accident on the way to work. This is not the acts of the gods or my fate. These are just a few of the things outside my control (eg a car swerving to avoid hitting a dog, then hits me. I have no control over the dog or the driver of the car). I have no need to get angry or upset as I have done all that I could to ensure success.  How could that behaviour be seen as unhealthy?  In regards to the contemplation of death. I believe that it can be quite happily translated into this: Consider what in life you are thankful for. Do you have a roof over your head? are you going to eat tonight? do you have access to clean water? are you fit and healthy? do you have access to modern technology?  If you didn't have these things how bad would your current situation be? Basically, the idea is to put things in context. yes missing an appointment is annoying but in the grand scheme of things is it really that bad?  In regards to death of a loved one:  It isn't to ignore or be cold and clinical about the death of a family member. It is about being clear that however much you love a person no individual is immortal. It is in our biology that we have an undefined shelf life. Being clear about this can help the grieving process."

HistoryofIdeas,2mejwg,HyacinthGirI,3,Sun Nov 16 03:46:48 2014 UTC,"Robert Boyle, FRS, (25 January 1627 – 31 December 1691) was an Anglo-Irish natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, and inventor. Born in Lismore, County Waterford, Ireland, he was also noted for his writings in theology.   Although his research clearly has its roots in the alchemical tradition, Boyle is largely regarded today as the first modern chemist, and therefore one of the founders of modern chemistry, and one of the pioneers of modern experimental scientific method. He is best known for Boyle's law, which describes the inversely proportional relationship between the absolute pressure and volume of a gas, if the temperature is kept constant within a closed system.   Among his works, The Sceptical Chymist is seen as a cornerstone book in the field of chemistry.   Here are some more posts about Robert Boyle and here are some about alchemy."

For the rest of the week Angie, Giles, Harry and Paul take us further into the history of ideas with programmes of their own.  Between them they'll talk about Isaiah Berlin's distinction between positive and negative freedom, JS Mill's thoughts on individual liberty and the state; what neuroscience has to say about the age old philosophical debate about Freewill and whether freedom is over-rated as a political, moral and psychological concept.

HistoryofIdeas,2m84wf,pzaaa,2,Thu Nov 13 22:43:01 2014 UTC,"'When Adam Delv'd and Eve Span Who was then the Gentle Man'  These words have been attributed to John Ball, a 14th-century radical priest.  In this programme, Melvyn Bragg goes in search of a man about whom little is known but whose words and beliefs galvanised the ordinary people of this country into unprecedented revolutionary action. Not only that, but he has been a marker through the centuries for other radicals - men and women determined to challenge the status quo and question injustice.  He was a lone voice for many years, preaching his doctrine in the south east of England, persecuted by the Church authorities he despised. But it wasn't until 1381 that John Ball's radical fire took hold, when he joined forces with Wat Tyler in Kent and led the Peasants' Revolt - misnamed as the participants were by no means all peasants or villeins. Thousands of men and some women quickly moved across the counties of the south east, destroying everything that represented those aspects of government they hated, and then just as swiftly moving on to the capital.  In London, they combined forces with many of the disgruntled city dwellers, met up with the king and made their demands. It was a moment in our history that was to terrify and influence the ruling classes for centuries to come. The words of John Ball - one of the first to communicate a political message to the people in English - have helped shape revolts and political thought for the last seven hundred years. Above all, they have been a beacon for what can be achieved if the power of radical idealism is harnessed to deep popular anger. A simple priest was able to terrorise a tight hierarchy that up to this point had controlled and enslaved thousands of the common people."

HistoryofIdeas,2m6j1x,Qwill2,2,Thu Nov 13 14:09:37 2014 UTC,"From Wikipedia:   Claude Adrien Helvétius (26 January or 26 February 1715 (sources differ) – 26 December 1771) was a French philosopher and littérateur.  Helvétius' philosophy belongs to the Egoist school:   All man's faculties may be reduced to physical sensation, even memory, comparison, judgment. Our only difference from the lower animals lies in our external organization. Self-interest, founded on the love of pleasure and the fear of pain, is the sole spring of judgment, action, and affection. Human beings are motivated solely by the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. ""These two,"" he says, ""are, and always will be, the only principles of action in man."" Self-sacrifice is prompted by the fact that the sensation of pleasure outweighs the accompanying pain and is thus the result of deliberate calculation. We have no freedom of choice between good and evil. There is no such thing as absolute right – ideas of justice and injustice change according to customs.   This view of man was largely Hobbesian – man is a system deterministically controllable by a suitable combination of reward and punishment, and the ends of government are to ensure the maximisation of pleasure."
HistoryofIdeas,2m6hog,Qwill2,1 point,Thu Nov 13 13:52:50 2014 UTC,"From Wikipedia:   Albert Otto Hirschman (born Otto-Albert Hirschmann; April 7, 1915 – December 10, 2012) was an influential economist and the author of several books on political economy and political ideology.   The Passions and the Interests is a history of the ideas laying the intellectual groundwork for capitalism. Hirschman describes how thinkers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries embraced the sin of avarice as an important counterweight to humankind's destructive passions. Capitalism was promoted by thinkers including Montesquieu, Sir James Steuart, and Adam Smith as repressing the passions for ""harmless"" commercial activities. Hirschman noted that words including ""vice"" and ""passion"" gave way to ""such bland terms"" as ""advantage"" and ""interest.""  Hirschman described The Passions and the Interests as the book he most enjoyed writing. According to Hirschman biographer Jeremy Adelman, the book reflected Hirschman's political moderation, a challenge to reductive accounts of human nature by economists as a ""utility-maximizing machine"" as well as Marxian or communitarian ""nostalgia for a world that was lost to consumer avarice.""  In World War II, he played a key role in in rescuing refugees in occupied France.

I suppose I'll at least read the view and give this book a try...Oh wait...  ""Perhaps duBois thinks she has to fight the monotheists on their own turf, but it makes it so easy to discount what she says. (I am including atheism in monotheism, because that’s what it is: a belief in the inexistence of God — of one god, that is.) There are citation gaps when she struggles to make the case for a prejudice against polytheism to the point that she includes online comments and quotations from Yahoo! (Answers, complete with typos and general insanity). She makes claims at polytheistic societies being more open and less warmongering than the monotheistic ones, linking the West’s thunder God with its much more violent history.""  So about on par with her work within her discipline then, thought so.   EDIT: I feel like I should expand about, especially since I'll almost certainly read this book anyway because I'm a damn sucker for this kind of thing. In essence, I think a similarly themed book WOULD be very interesting from a proper Classicist with a background in ancient religions, because that is the area where a lot of debates on the nature of poly/mono/heno/kathenotheisms were played out from, say, the 19th century onwards. In particular the shift from poly to monotheism under the Roman empire is very well documented and (Vedic) Hinduism is actually a very popular point of reference when we study these ancient religions so people are hardly unaware of or hostile towards polytheism."

We like this clear-cut development because we like to believe that progress is a real thing: that we are all moving towards getting everything right. Once we were really foolish, then just foolish, then less foolish, and now we’re finally okay, we have things figured out, or at least we’re not far from that.

HistoryofIdeas,2lvzv5,Qwill2,1 point,Mon Nov 10 19:46:18 2014 UTC,"Abstract:  The roots of law & economics lie in late 19th century continental Europe. However, this early movement did not persist, having been cut off in the 1930s. After World War II, modern law & economics was (re-)invented in the United States and subsequently grew into a major field of research at U.S. law schools. In continental Europe, law & economics was re-imported as a discipline within economics, driven by economists interested in legal issues rather than by legal scholars. Hence, the European discourse was more strongly influenced by formal analysis, using mathematical models. Today, research in the U.S., Europe, and in other countries around the world, including Latin America and Asia, uses formal, empirical, and intuitive methods. New subfields, such as behavioral law & economics and experimental law & economics, have grown in the U.S. and in Europe during the past two decades."
