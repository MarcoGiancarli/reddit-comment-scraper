mead,3e5gr3,lordofcatan10,7,Wed Jul 22 02:40:20 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would be transferring it sooner rather than later.  Beats flirting with the ""shoulda, woulda, coulda"" if things go pear shaped due to pressure during fermentation.  That carboy is a goner."
mead,3e5gr3,1WANTtohatereddit,6,Wed Jul 22 03:06:26 2015 UTC,"Ditto. And I wouldn't move it at all.  Once OP gets the mead out, he should take a good picture of the fracture and post it to /r/homebrewing with a title like ""near miss"" for easy karma - and to insight glass vs. plastic fistfights, right /u/i_forget_my_userids?"
mead,3e5gr3,balathustrius,2,Wed Jul 22 04:55:50 2015 UTC,So I accidentally bumped my full-o-mead carboy against my dryer as I was hauling it into position. There is now a small (dime sized) spider crack in it. It looks as if it's all on the inside and that it doesn't go all the way through. There is no liquid or air coming from the crack. Is it possible to get this fixed or will I have to get rid of the carboy once I rack in a few weeks?
mead,3e5gr3,StormBeforeDawn,5,Wed Jul 22 02:42:24 2015 UTC,Toss it. No way to repair safely. just be careful with it till the batch is done.
mead,3e5gr3,ioillusion,3,Wed Jul 22 03:05:26 2015 UTC,There's an epoxy called Hxtal NYL-1 that'll repair them (I keep some in my shop for customers) ... but it's too expensive for a single repair.
mead,3e5gr3,Rock-Box,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:35:11 2015 UTC,If moving the carboy to another location for racking/bottling/etc. I'd also make sure to only push/pull from the very bottom of the carboy to avoid any strain on the fracture.
mead,3e5gr3,madwilliamflint,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:56:18 2015 UTC,"You're okay for now. But get a replacement and syphon that all from one to the other as soon as you can.   If it's early in the process I'd say syphon it, lees and all. But if you were close to racking then all the better.   The fun part is that you can't be sure what'll happen when the pressure changes from pouring it out, so you might want to gently move it outside."

mead,3e3x9b,i_forget_my_userids,3,Tue Jul 21 19:39:15 2015 UTC,"Its pretty simple to make, this picture is actually a week old, I racked over the weekend and tasted it, it had finished fermenting and had a good kick to it but wasn't overwhelming. So far, I really like this recipe!  I used:  2 yellow bell peppers, chopped thin and with the seeds removed,  2 dried Ancho Chile peppers (easily found in the Mexican isle of Wal-Mart), cut into strips, seeds and all,  2 cayenne peppers, chopped with seeds added,  3 lbs honey.  Fill to the top with spring water, and add any nutrients you'd like. My gravity began around 1.11, and fermented to dry in about a week.   If it isn't hot enough after your first racking, to chop up two fresh jalapeños and add them in for a week or two to kick the spice up a bit. Totally optional though."
mead,3e3x9b,Davis_a_smith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:44:09 2015 UTC,"Water to 1 gallon, I assume, given your gravity?   I might mod this to make a totally Sonoran Desert mead, by getting the peppers from a local source and then using a AZ honey...."
mead,3e3x9b,BigBassBone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, 1 gallon. Tbh I didn't measure the water, I just filled it until it left enough headspace for bubbling."

mead,3e3x9b,balathustrius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:08:21 2015 UTC,"I've done both. The yeast will find it if you don't mix it up. But giving it a good shake helps get oxygen in, which helps the yeast get rolling."

mead,3e3x9b,balathustrius,3,Tue Jul 21 19:42:17 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend this:  (Weights are post-cleaning. Cleaning assumes removing the stem, seeds, and pith/core.)   For 1 gallon   3 pounds cleaned jalapeno peppers 1-2 pounds cleaned cayenne peppers (more if you like heat) 3 pounds mesquite honey D-47 or Red Star Pasteur Champagne    Mesquite smoke peppers at 200F for 2 hours. Keep an eye on them and don't let them turn into crispy chips. You want them just before this happens. Edit: Don't get a face full of the smoke if you don't like aerosolized capsaicin in your nose and eyes.  Mix up the must as usual. Add peppers. Pitch. Ferment w/ SNA and aeration as usual.   Rack off peppers as fermentation ends.  Add 3 ounces of oak cubes for 4-8 weeks.  Backsweeten to whatever level you desire.  Age at least 6 months.  Approach with caution on cold day. Drink from rocks glass. Wish you made 5 gallons.  Peppers naturally fluctuate a lot in capsaicin content. If you find the final result isn't strong/hot enough, you can drop in a cleaned habanero or two (or even something stronger, if you're a heat fiend) along with the oak.  If the final result is too strong, my only advice is ""Don't be such a baby."" Doesn't seem to apply to you."
mead,3e3x9b,Davis_a_smith,2,Tue Jul 21 19:58:35 2015 UTC,"Ok, that sounds absolutely amazing, very easy to make and scale up! What do you think about using Premier Cuvee?"
mead,3e3x9b,balathustrius,2,Tue Jul 21 20:02:46 2015 UTC,"It's a yeast I haven't used, but IIRC it's similar to EC-1118 in tolerance (18%), purpose (champagne), and fermentation speed (quick), so I'd recommend against it for this. I suggested D-47 and Pasteur Champagne because they're both limited to around 14% (easier to backsweeten) and shouldn't take off quite as fast (more D-47 on that score)."

If you were at 22°C (71-72°F) ambient temperature, you were probably a few degrees higher inside the fermenter, which may have pushed passed the upper ideal range of 4184 (65-75°F).

mead,3dyosf,i_forget_my_userids,3,Mon Jul 20 16:58:10 2015 UTC,I have seen on beer forums that certain Belgian yeasts are SLOW to carbonate just as you mentioned. This may be the case.
mead,3dyosf,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:24:59 2015 UTC,"I use Belgian bottles a good bit and have carbed beer in them, using Belgian yeasts sometimes (edit: including WLP500 which did take a while).  My limited experience and rule of thumb is I assume at least a month at around room temp which for me is around 70F.    I've seen continued improvement over the course of a few months if no fresh yeast was pitched.  Some clone recipes I brewed called for pitching fresh yeast 3 days prior to priming and bottling - but his was beer and ale yeast not mead levels of alcohol, etc.  So long story short my experience is that 2 weeks is often stated but is more like ""bare minimum ideal case scenario""."

Might be a temperature issue, since I'm in the south now -- I have to keep my storage area controlled via thermostat. Also, I use flip tops when bottle conditioning, which create an airtight seal."
mead,3dyosf,Alcoholic_Autonomous,2,Mon Jul 20 18:53:22 2015 UTC,"Ditto to everyone else, give it two more weeks, /u/sdkingv.  Then come back if no/low carbonation. I suppose it's possible that your yeast hit their tolerance and gave up. 12.5% is doing pretty good for an ale yeast.  You might be able to goose them along by putting the bottles someplace very slightly warmer, depending on what your ""room temperature"" is."

mead,3dv8z9,schnp,3,Mon Jul 20 01:39:39 2015 UTC,"I'm still learning about mead so I've been making just single addition meads to figure out what flavor a I like and don't like.  This recipe followed Bray's One month Mead. It's my second time using this recipe and it really is good after a month, though it definitely tastes better after a few extra months.  Basically I just made a five gallon batch of orange blossom honey mead (ended up just under 15%), then split it into several one gallon jugs. Froze all my fruits the day before, thawed in the morning then puréed mangos and strawberries. Smashed the blue berries a bit then tossed them in, and halved the dates, removed the nuts, the tossed them in a jug as well.  Really just experimenting and trying new things. Anything in particular you were looking to find out?"
mead,3dv8z9,IMightBePaulasBitch,3,Mon Jul 20 02:01:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly that. I'm new to mead and so far have only made a couple gallons. Want to get into melomels soon though.   This is great, thank you."

mead,3dv8z9,SHv2,2,Sun Jul 19 23:23:10 2015 UTC,"This is my first try at it and just guessed at the right amount of mango to add. Most recipes I've seen have the fruit additions around 2-3lb a gallon.  I bought 2.5lbs of mangos for a 1 gallon jug, used a potato peeler to get rid of the skin, then diced it pretty small. Froze over night, thawed, then puréed in the blender.  It smelled amazing when I poured it in. Let's hope it tastes like that in a few months."

Wait for it to settle again, rack, and then degas. Allow to settle until satisfied, and then bottle."
mead,3dtuaz,JonasTorgersen,2,Sun Jul 19 12:46:11 2015 UTC,I didn't even know about degassing :) I've looked it up though. Thank you! I'll try it out.
mead,3dtuaz,802bikeguy_com,2,Sun Jul 19 12:54:44 2015 UTC,"It's co2 in suspension (in the mead itself). Even with an airlock/blowoff, there's some pressure that builds up, gently force carbonating the mead over the course of fermentation.  In beer making, when calculating amount of sugar to add at bottling, one must account for the co2 in suspension so as not to end up overcarbonated. It's based on final fermentation temp. Cooler the fermentation temp, the more co2 ends up in the solution.  It's not the yeast trapping carbonation..."
mead,3dtuaz,balathustrius,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:30:21 2015 UTC,"It's reasonable that what you're seeing is co2 release from yeast that are essentially decomposing, if you have a substantial amount of lees on the bottom.   Of course, the way to see if it's fermentation, natural degassing, or something else, is to take two gravity readings a week or so apart."

mead,3dtt52,Davis_a_smith,2,Sun Jul 19 11:51:43 2015 UTC,My only criticism of the concept is that blackberries are also fairly tart. I'd expect to make it a pretty sweet mead.
mead,3dtt52,balathustrius,2,Sun Jul 19 15:08:56 2015 UTC,"That depends on how ripe your blackberries are.

mead,3dtt52,balathustrius,3,Sun Jul 19 15:28:40 2015 UTC,"Similarly, I grew up on a farm with several stains growing wild everywhere. Once the sugar ferments out, what's left is quite tart, even with good ripe berries.   The big blackberry melomel I recently made was back sweetened to 1.035.

But, the ratios in the original recipe that I made and people fell head over heels for had room for the honey to shine, that was purposeful. You could, say, caramelize the honey a bit and it would come through in that opening for it.  I have been thinking on doing a root beer or an orange soda.

mead,3drap8,mahalambda,2,Sat Jul 18 18:23:34 2015 UTC,"This is a complicated question.  The answer first depends on what kind of bottles you use. Beer bottles and champagne bottles handle different levels of carbonation.   Second, it is less likely to volcano upon opening if it is chilled first. The colder it is, the more dissolved CO2 it can hold.   Third will just be whatever you prefer. I personally prefer somewhere between champagne and beer levels, and I use swingtop 750mL soda bottles. They handle more than beer bottles will, but are much easier to deal with than champagne bottles.   Also, you can carbonate as little or as much as you want in any kind of bottle, as long as you don't carbonate beyond its capabilities (you can do beer in champagne bottles with no problem, but you cannot do champagne in beer bottles)."

mead,3doxhd,woman_WOAH_man,2,Sat Jul 18 05:12:10 2015 UTC,Will you please explain your technique when waxing? I've done it a handful of times only to end up with less than desirable results.
mead,3doxhd,Buddhalite,3,Sat Jul 18 15:47:43 2015 UTC,"Sure! First I heated the wax by placing it in an empty oversized can of beans, and placing the can with wax within a pot of water on the stove, in order to achieve an even heat distribution.  I also used a can because of its height, and because I could leave the residual wax within it and not have to worry about using any actual kitchenware.  When the wax was thoroughly molten, I grabbed my bottles and held them upside down with a slight angle to achieve the angled effect.  I slowly dipped them to the desired depth.  Immediately upon removing the bottle from the wax, I kept the bottle upside down and began twisting the bottle with my hand, so the residual wax dripped evenly.  This was very similar to a salt or pepper grinder kind of motion.  I did this for about 20 seconds with each bottle, or until the wax had solidified enough to hold its shape.  The end result should be an evenly applied coat of wax!  With some waxes, you might need to do more than one coat, because they're less viscous than this wax, but even then, I think my technique would be the same."

mead,3dmke8,x888x,6,Fri Jul 17 14:15:30 2015 UTC,"I think the real question is: how will you ever know where the line is if you never cross it?  For 5.25 gallons of mead (into secondary), use a 10-gallon fermenter - you'll use ~53# total (10#/gal) of really dank ripe blueberries.  If you can't smell them from three feet away don't use them.  If you want to secondary in a 1-gallon jug, then you'll use that 5-gallon bucket for your primary, and adjust the total # of berries.  Your must should be 1.150 or similar - you should try to calculate the water addition the fruit will make - your final ABV will be ~14%, with an FG of about 1.040 if you use 3 grams / gallon of 71B-1122 (Narbonne).  I'm sorry I'm not at my desk or I would make the exact calculations for you.  You will lose several gallons to the fruit mash coming out of primary - I'm sorry I can't calculate exactly the volume of must you'll need to put over the top of your blueberries.  Wash them, freeze them, and then gently thaw in a sanitized fermenter until they are cool but not frozen.  Rehydrate your yeast in Go-Ferm, and do a standard SNA for the first 4 days post lag with reasonably vigorous cap management aka ""punch downs"".

Bottle when gravity measurements have stayed the same for 3 weeks.  Send me a bottle!"
mead,3dmke8,JamesAGreen,3,Fri Jul 17 14:53:32 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm going to ask a few questions and re-write your steps. I'll absolutely send you a bottle. PM me your address.  First, the steps:   Wash, Freeze, Thaw blueberries Start Yeast Get to SQ of 1.150 Pitch Yeast Once lag hits, add Nutrient Rack into Secondary (1 month) Rack to Tertiary (1 month)   Questions:   How long in Primary? I've never added nutrients post-pitch. How much Nutrient? Should I use DAP? All the fruit in Primary (and none in secondary?) should I mash the blueberries (or puree)?   I've been using 1G jugs but my wife has a 5 gal ferment bucket and 5 gal glass carboy. Going to ""borrow"""
mead,3dmke8,balathustrius,3,Fri Jul 17 15:24:33 2015 UTC,"Just to rapid fire here...  It'll be hard to get an accurate gravity reading. I'd take a reading to sanity check myself before pitching, but there's still both sugar and water bound up in the blueberries.  Mixing up a berry must is a trial in its own right. I'd mix the honey and water, then add the blueberries last.  You'll want the must to warm up to a reasonable temperature before pitching the yeast, to avoid sending them straight back to dormancy right after waking them up.  /u/JamesAGreen, what must temperature do you look for, to pitch, in a must made with cold berries?   Nutrient   I highly recommend, if you're going to make a fruit bomb melomel, to read this. It should give you the tools to answer all of those questions about nutrition.   should I mash the blueberries (or puree)?   I squish them a bit before I add them to the must. I probably wouldn't puree, because tiny particulates take longer to fall out. The yeast will get in there and do the work.   All the fruit in Primary (and none in secondary?)   Yep. The water and sugar load from the fruit in a fruit-heavy melomel makes adding significant amounts of it post-fermentation logistically difficult. And there's already so much overwhelming fruit flavor and aroma that you don't gain much by adding more, later."
mead,3dmke8,Bunsomel,3,Fri Jul 17 15:39:16 2015 UTC,"I can elaborate a bit on some of these:   It'll be hard to get an accurate gravity reading.   I don't even bother after it's been mixed with whole fruit.   I'd mix the honey and water, then add the blueberries last.   yes.   what must temperature do you look for, to pitch, in a must made with cold berries?   Our musts are usually very cold do to the amount of fruit we use, which is often quick frozen to preserve it during shipping. Our temperature regulator is usually set in the low 60's, and we will allow the must to raise temperature up to that point on its own.   I probably wouldn't puree, because tiny particulates take longer to fall out.   yep, if you puree that much fruit all of the little bits will coagulate together and rise to the top, which can act like a blanket and trap the CO2 underneath. Results can be quite explosive if you're not punching down daily - sometimes several times per day. Frozen and then thawed breaks down the fruit thoroughly enough.   about nutrition   In an atypical must such as this, it's my personal belief that you don't need to supplement as much nutrient as you would normally do otherwise. The fruit will provide lots of nutrient and cell material to make the yeast happy."
mead,3dmke8,balathustrius,3,Fri Jul 17 17:14:28 2015 UTC,"I don't even bother after it's been mixed with whole fruit.   Like I said, I just do a sanity check. Little things like that prevent me from waking up and thinking, ""I forgot to add the second bowl of honey. It's still in the basement. Probably full of camel crickets,"" at 3 in the morning.   In an atypical must such as this, it's my personal belief that you don't need to supplement as much nutrient as you would normally do otherwise.   What ppm would be normal for you? Normal for me, for a normal strength mead, is ~200 ppm N including N from GoFerm. I would add approximately 150-180 ppm N to this must. Possibly less, but I'd want to know an approximate N content of the berries."
mead,3dmke8,JamesAGreen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:40:35 2015 UTC,"In an atypical must such as this, it's my personal belief that you don't need to supplement as much nutrient as you would normally do otherwise.   This is absolutely true, and if you analyze Ken's published recipes as of late, you will see that his numbers don't add up to the ""generally-agreed-upon"" figures for ""required"" PPM of nitrogen, for example.  It is our belief that most meadmakers over-nutrify their musts with DAP and Fermaid, etc, especially in a bold melomel like this.  The fruit provides nutrient - and in fact with this poundage of fruit you may even be able to get away with no nutrient added.  This is an experimead that I would like to run one day - and rest assured I'll provide the community with the results."

Here's an example for anyone wondering.  I discovered this on my own, and before I visited Schramm's and talked to Ken, I thought it it must be a typo, because how could he be wrong?  Though my calculations improved a lot since then, here's a comment I made about the numbers not adding up.  I still think the thing mentioned in the first paragraph of my comment is is a typo. But here's the relevant part:   I'm not going to argue with the Master, but do those numbers seem low to anyone else? It looks like he's only adding 50 ppm nitrogen in musts below 1.120, and 100-125 ppm N in higher gravity musts.   To revisit the numbers from that paper today, for one of his 1.120 or higher musts:  8 grams DAP = 90 ppm  5 grams FK = 35 ppm  Total: 125 ppm.  For lower gravity meads:  4 grams DAP = 45 ppm  2 grams FK = 10 PPM  Total: 55 ppm  GoFerm at a 2g per gallon yeast pitch rate, adds an additional 20 ppm IIRC.  Sound right?"
mead,3dmke8,JamesAGreen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:29:53 2015 UTC,"Well, and remember you're not calculating the PPM of nitrogen from the fruit - how can you?  The total PPM for musts is determined by gravity, yes, but also by honey type and what else is in the mead in primary.  The additions made by the fruit you just have to guesstimate based on experience."
mead,3dmke8,balathustrius,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:38:53 2015 UTC,"Well, and remember you're not calculating the PPM of nitrogen from the fruit - how can you?   Right, we're on the same page there. What I'm not clear about is whether the numbers we're looking at right now, from zymurgy, are about a fruit mead must, or a traditional. The article outlines the higher gravity must additions on page 24, pretexting it it with    For traditional 5-gallon mead fermentations with a gravity above 1.120, the keys are:   So it sounds like that's for a traditional. Are you saying those numbers are more appropriate to a melomel, or that a melomel can cut the numbers back even further?"
mead,3dmke8,JamesAGreen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:44:53 2015 UTC,"/u/JamesAGreen, what must temperature do you look for, to pitch, in a must made with cold berries?   60 deg F, controlled at 63+-2 deg F if possible for 71B-1122  But furreal, though - read /u/Balathustrius' white paper and Ken's articles (plural) in Zymurgy on mead and you'll be set.  There is a lot of information out there about nutrients in meadmaking and everyone has their own opinion - I can only advocate for what I know works and for what you can evaluate for yourself.  Steve Piatz has a method he describes in this book and Sergio Moutela has his own method also (TOSNA) - neither of which I've had the chance to experimead with (although this work is ongoing for me - my experimental mead reactor is nearly complete - using this I can measure dissolved oxygen, pH changes, temperature, CO2 output, etc all in real time as the fermentation proceeds, so it will be a perfect test bed to determine optimal nutrient schedules, etc)."
mead,3dmke8,Bunsomel,2,Fri Jul 17 19:52:43 2015 UTC,"I'm truly jealous of your situation!! I'll answer what I can:   How long in Primary?   4-6 weeks on fruit is good.    I've never added nutrients post-pitch. How much Nutrient?   Read /u/balathustrius's white paper. The massive amount of fruit will give you some nutrients and material to keep the yeast very healthy, so you don't need to be totally anal about hitting all the amounts spot on.   Should I use DAP?   This question goes beyond the scope of your mead, as some people advocate the TOSNA strategy. Regardless, DAP is an efficient Nitrogen delivery vehicle and is very useful.    All the fruit in Primary (and none in secondary?)   Yep. with this much fruit you will not be lacking in flavor, I promise you. Even more so because this mead won't be taken totally dry, leaving some of the residual sugars from the fruit and honey left behind when it finishes.   should I mash the blueberries (or puree)?   Freezing and thawing will be enough. no need to mash/puree or anything like that.  feel free to PM me or James any questions you have along the way. Meads using this much fruit can be quite a bit of work, but they are immensely rewarding."
mead,3dmke8,JamesAGreen,2,Fri Jul 17 17:32:39 2015 UTC,"One month. Do a SNA for the first 4 days (appropriately scaled as per your recipe size) as per Ken Schramm method (seen here in Zymurgy and again in a recent issue, which I will reprint and send you with his permission via email). Read 'Optimizing Honey Fermentation and 'Ten Tips for Making Great Mead' in Zymurgy (link above and I'll send you a reprint in email). See above. All the fruit in primary - for many reasons.  The yeast will scavenge nutrient and cell wall materials from the fruit, and the fruit will provide pH buffering compounds.  Also, the end product will be more drinkable in 3 months time than anything you've ever made with fruit in secondary - none of the off flavors associated with stressed yeast and all the honey/fruit flavors will be more integrated. Leave the blueberries alone!  What did they ever do to you?!??  You can gently break them up during pigeage aka cap management aka punch downs.  But their skins are so fragile that the vigor of fermentation and punch downs will open them up slightly, just enough for what you need.  I wouldn't puree or mash them.   The bucket is going to be essential for primary fermentation.  I would try to acquire another bucket/vessel to mix the must in.  This is my current method, to thaw the fruit in your sanitized fermenter and mix your must in a separate vessel, so that you hit your starting must gravity, etc.  This way you can drill/blend the shit out of the must to introduce hella oxygen."

Staggered nutrient additions (SNA) is something /u/balathustrius can tell you all about. There was a comment in /r/homebrewing where he went into detail. In any case, you end up with mead.  One pound of fruit per gallon will give you a good taste, but this is just a ballpark estimate. Using much more fruit is totally fine; you will just experience a little stronger flavor. Your two pounds sounds like a good amount. You could also try freezing and/or pureeing the fruit. If whole berries go in, be sure to punch the cap.   How long you keep them depends on how long you keep your mead in primary. After, say a month in primary, two or three weeks on the fruit should serve you fine.   Also, since this is a one gallon batch, I am assuming you are using a demijohn. Fruit additions are no doubt possible in a demijohn, but a bucket makes a world of a difference when the time to clean up rolls around."

I guess in that case i may have to add more water since the little big mouth has more than a gallon. But the bright side is it would be easier to punch the cap with it.

If you can get a wine yeast (particularly 71B-1122), or an American Ale yeast (US-05), you'll probably be more pleased with your final product. The wine yeast is $2 for 2 packets, which is plenty for a 6 gallon batch. Even 1 pack is usually fine.  It's always hard to say how long it'll take before bottling. You're looking for:   Desired level of sweetness. Desired flavor. Clarity. Let all the sediment settle out! Fermentation is finished. This should go without saying, but by ""finished"" I mean ""high confidence it won't/can't start again."" If you backsweetened or added flavorings, you give it a few weeks to convince you that it isn't going to wake back up.   3 months is generally my minimum."

mead,3dfnq3,balathustrius,2,Thu Jul 16 14:41:45 2015 UTC,"swamp cooler + yeast tolerant of warmer temps, and SNA without using DAP. adding more yeast has very little to do with how fast fermentation progresses, because you would need to pitch a crazy huge amount of yeast to make a noticeable impact, healthy yeast will reproduce at a nearly exponential rate if they're given an optimal environment (enough sugar, available Nitrogen & Oxygen, little to no competitors) and even if it's close, it's usually pretty good."

mead,3dfnq3,ShoeSnatcher,0,Wed Jul 15 23:37:26 2015 UTC,"I would just proceed without modification. My first batch went 10 days during primary fermentation at about 85F and turned out just fine. The likely result is that your fermentation will go a little quicker. It may take longer to age too. An interesting experiment would be to repeat the same recipe later in the year and ferment at cooler temperatures to see if you can taste any differences. I'm not as experienced as some others here, anybody with more mazering have some advice?"
mead,3dfr2j,awellplacedkick,3,Wed Jul 15 22:37:10 2015 UTC,"Cold crashing is bringing it down to near frozen temperature. This suspends the yeast (but does not necessarily kill it), and significantly speeds up clearing.  A fridge works just fine."
mead,3dfr2j,DeathtoPants,2,Wed Jul 15 22:47:58 2015 UTC,"You can also just plain let it sit as long as it's sealed in an air-proof container with an airlock. Cold crashing mead doesn't really benefit you that much. I mean, it might help with clearing, and there are reasons to chill if you're trying to stop fermentation. But there are also more patient ways to do those things, and mead is kind of a patient person's drink to start with."

mead,3desbp,meh2you2,2,Thu Jul 16 04:57:30 2015 UTC,"Oh here we go.  So hard cider used to be a mainstay of American drinking.  Back then, it was just called cider.  And unfermented apple juice was called juice.  Then in the prohibition years prohibitionists tried to make the cider/juice thing intentionally confusing and mislabelled.  So cider now stands for unfermented juice.  And only ""hard cider"" stands for alcoholic, unlike the rest of the world where cider implies the hard.  These days ""juice"". Tends to just stand for sweet apple juice.  Much sweeter than most European juices, cause 'murica.  This is actually a large problem for making hard cider in the US, because even the good, not from concentrate, no preservative juices are still basically pure sugar, leaving no apple flavor once it ferments out.  Cider tends to mean fresh pressed, all natural juice.  Tends to be less sweet.  Pretty much the only place you can get real cider is at an apple orchard.  Most "" cider"" you would see at a supermarket is really just the juice mentioned above, just calling itself cider to seem fancier since there's no actual rules about it ."

mead,3dexu7,sunpoprain,3,Wed Jul 15 19:09:33 2015 UTC,"You could do pretty much anything to your fruit, as long you don't add preservatives like potassium sorbate, which inhibits yeast growth. A jam will include some extra sugar(?), which just boosts your ABV.   Freezing should not be looked down upon. As the fruit freezes, it beaks down some, making it easier for the yeast to extract flavors.  Fruit additions in carboys or demijohns can be a bit of a problem. It may be easy to get the fruit into the demijohn, but getting it out can be a bit of a problem. You could also puree your fruit."
mead,3dexu7,JonasTorgersen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:17:57 2015 UTC,"A jam or canned sauce will be pureed enough to slide right in. As for freezing, the difference between jam made with fresh vs frozen fruit is extremely noticeable. I imagine the same would hold true for mead. Sort of along the lines of why we don't heat the honey must (?) any more - you lose something of the aromatics and flavor in the honey."
mead,3dexu7,JonasTorgersen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:22:25 2015 UTC,"You're correct. The best thing to add to melomels is fresh and ripe fruit, but a quick trip to the freezer of maybe 24 hours will do little to alter its taste in a melomel. You'd be perfectly fine either way. Many people have reported success with using untreated and chopped up fruit as well as super market bought frozen fruit, but when they go head to head, fresh wins out.   The reason people reccoment not heating your must is because honey includes an extraordinary amount of compounds, many of which are volatile. At temperatures of ~160°F (70°C) many of these taste- and aroma contributing elements evaporate, meaning a less flavorfull mead."
mead,3dexu7,JonasTorgersen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:03:24 2015 UTC,I'm searching for a solution because I won't be able to maintain the mead in primary until the fruit is ripe again. Anything I freeze will likely be frozen for months (I assume primary isn't faster then a couple months at best)

You could let this ferment out, and depending on which comes first out of reaching your yeast's alcohol tollerence or it fermenting dry, decide your course of action from there. If you reach the yeast's tollerence, you don't really need to do anything else. Just add more strawberry reduction to get you back to your desired sweetness. If it ferments dry, then you make sure to add stabilizers and add some more strawberry reduction to get back to desired sweetness.   This whole endeavour won't really ruin your batch, but you will have a slightly altered taste due to the renewed fermentation, along with a little higher ABV."

mead,3darj9,Davis_a_smith,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:15:36 2015 UTC,"Nope, I have never done that. Honestly, I found ratios which work and ran with them... I would think adding honey  to the mead would skew how one maths out the alcohol content.... unless you can figure the ABV prior to adding the honey, guarantee that no more fermenting will occur and can adjust the percentage according to the increase in volume."
mead,3darj9,Subterfugitiv,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:22:31 2015 UTC,You have to take an initial gravity reading and then every successive reading becomes the next initial gravity. Does that make sense?

I like to get all the abv I can... then decide at then end if it is still or sparkling.
mead,3darj9,Davis_a_smith,2,Wed Jul 15 04:27:52 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, I try and keep all of mine somewhere in the 12% ABV range and the sweetness level is determined by when I kill the fermenting."

mead,3darj9,Subterfugitiv,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:50:18 2015 UTC,"This may be long.... The process for sparkling is only different in that you ""prime"" your bottles with a little honey or corn sugar before putting the mead in. (I use a teaspoon for 16 oz bottles.) You also don't stop the fermentation necessarily and you often don't leave it in the fermenter as long. I wait until there are no more bubbles coming out of the airlock but there are still tiny bubbles rising through the mead before I bottle what will be a sparkling mead. A still mead is just that. You ferment it to a ""target"" specific gravity and stop the fermentation or you let it go until it stops by itself and then simply put it in the sterilized bottles."
mead,3darj9,Subterfugitiv,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:42:53 2015 UTC,"Lemons are a great start for a simple recipe.... bag o' lemons mead. 10# in the primary. 5# in the secondary, and you have a decently high abv with a good balance of sweetness and tartness and putting some of the spent lemons in the fermentor adds layers of flavor."
mead,3d8wnm,Zer0stealth,3,Tue Jul 14 12:35:06 2015 UTC,"For semi-sweet with EC-1118, you should be shooting for 19-20% potential alcohol, meaning about 1.150.  Personally I'd use 71B or D-47, as it will end somewhere around 14%, meaning you won't have to age it as long. In that case, shoot for 1.115.  Learn to use the calculator in the sidebar, it's pretty handy."

It was drinkable right after primary, delicious after a month, and all 5 gal were gone shortly after. If you're looking for strong, ec-1118 will do it, but you may lose a lot of flavor along the way.

mead,3d67jx,Darr_Syn,3,Mon Jul 13 21:10:11 2015 UTC,"Very easy beginner's mead. Great for those of us who have no patience. :)  Disclaimer: This is a super easy quick to make mead. It's what I do when I run out of mead and all my batches are months out.  I'm keeping it simple to help make it less intimidating for people who want to try making mead but are nervous about the complexity of some recipes. I'm keeping it super simple intentionally! Also, I personally do not like joam and I wish I never wasted my time trying to make it. Of course that's just me,  PLENTY of people think it's excellent.  Cool thing about mead is it really is super versatile and somewhere out there is a mead you will like.  All of my friends and family love this recipe.  Hopefully a few of you do as well. I posted it in a r/drunk thread awhile back and got some really good reports back.   This mead is one of my favorites and It's ready to drink in only 12 days. alcohol percentage is 8-12%.   This is for one gallon.  Ingredients: 2.5# clover honey of the highest quality you can find.  Honey bear stuff from the grocery store will work but it won't taste as good.   One cup of blackberries.  (Or whatever berries you feel like.  Pom/blueberry at a ratio of 1/3 is super good too.  Blueberry is pretty good also.)  Spring water  Lalvin ec1118 yeast (get it on Amazon)  Clean out a one gallon jug.  Use a milk jug if you want,  it won't be in there long enough to affect flavor. If you have proper cleaners meant for brewing great, otherwise a tiny bit of bleach diluted with water rinsed in it does just fine.  Rinse well.   Put 2.5 pounds of clover honey in the one gallon jug.  Put one cup of blackberries (or whatever) in your jug and Get the juice in there too. Top it off with spring water (I used tap water on most of them but I think I'm luckier than most because my tap water is really good and it turned out the same) don't forget to leave a little room for it to foam. 4 inches from the top should be OK.   Shake the crap out of it. Get the honey to dissolve as best as possible. Do it until your arms go numb.  Pour in lavin ec1118 yeast. One full packet. Just pour it straight in.  If you have been storing it in the fridge take it out the day before.    Install airlock. (Get one from Amazon) if you really don't want to get one you don't have to.  You could just rubber band a clean rag on top of it and that will do just fine.   Every day shake the crap out of it for seven days. Then let it sit untouched for two days. You'll see all the sediment settle at the bottom.  This is good.   If you are doing this on the cheap then SLOWLY pour the mead from this jug to another one you have already cleaned out.  Try your best not to let the sediment go into the new jug. Find something to filter out the berries. Get creative.  Use a clean rag if you have to. you are going to lose a little mead but that's OK. If you have a siphon hose use that to transfer the mead to the new jug.    Throw it in the fridge for two days. Transfer to bottles if you want or just pour into glasses. At this point it's delicious so drink up!  It's wise to keep it in the fridge from here on out. I've had ec1118 yeast wake up after Weeks of being bottled.  Keeping it cold will keep that from happening.   For the record It's not very clear without sitting a month or two but it's clear enough for me. :) if the appearance doesn't bother you then don't worry about the cloudiness.   http://www.reddit.com/r/mead/comments/2z2sbn/very_easy_beginners_mead_great_for_those_of_us/"
mead,3d67jx,hasnonaim,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:25:53 2015 UTC,"OK, make a base mead, 2 pounds of honey per gallon, 1/4 cup finely chopped raisins per gallon (for nutrient) and let that ferment for 3 weeks.    In the mean time, but your blueberries in a blender and then freeze the puree.    The day before you rack the mead, thaw the puree.  The next day, sanitize your carboy, put the blueberry puree (at 3 pounds per gallon) along with 1 more pound of honey per gallon into the bottom of it then siphon the mead from your primary container into your secondary container on top.  Toss in another 1/4 cup finely chopped raisins per gallon (again nutrient not for flavor).    Gently stir it to mix everything, but don't aerate it.    Fermentation will start again, and you will have a great blueberry mead in like 4 more weeks, drinkable pretty quickly.    For yeast use a Wyeast mead smack pack, either sweet or dry depending on how you want your brew."

mead,3d078b,Zuxxkij,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:23:13 2015 UTC,Do you happen to have the recipe on hand? Recently made my first mead as well as my first raspberry wine but haven't tried to mix them together. Curious about ratios.
mead,3d078b,Manetheren86,2,Sun Jul 12 14:00:05 2015 UTC,i did this free hand and almost four years ago so i'm a little cloudy on details but pretty much like the usual 3:1 honey to water ratio and then blend about a cup and a half of loose raspberries in a high power blender like a nutribullet with about a half shot of vodka per gallon of mead and let it sit for a while so the alcohol kill any microbes on the berries. then just bloom the yeast and mix everything together.  Also in hindsight if i could i would mix blackberries in it too because the seeds held within the berry contain a lot of tannins which will give the mead more shelf life when extracted via the blender.  This mead had one stage fermentation and due to the added sugar from the berries it had an accelerated fermentation period lasting about 3 months.   There was a residual mild sweetness to the mead but the tannins from the raspberries worked nicely with the flavor.
mead,3d078b,UNKN0VVN,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:45:10 2015 UTC,did you open? how is it? im about to done a raspberry myself
mead,3d078b,new-Baltimoreon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:31:12 2015 UTC,"I drank all the other bottles about two years ago but I decided to let this one sit and age to see what would happen. The first bottles were great, they came out well-rounded and fruity. I'm curious to see what this is like but I'm probably not going to open it for another year or so. Through the aging process it has developed an amber tint rather than the original rose color that it was. Hopefully the flavor stayed better than the color did."
mead,3d078b,new-Baltimoreon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:58:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if tge same effect happens with Raspberry, but with Blueberries and red/purple grapes, much of the color comes from compounds in the skins called anthrocyanins, which in addition to color, add a fair amount of bitter/acidic/dry/tannic flavor notes.   when I made a Blueberry Mel, after about a year and a half in the bottle, I noticed a gradual change of color, a slight build up of dark purple (nearly black) powder in the bottoms of the bottles, and the taste was a little more rounded and less bitter.   YMMV"
mead,3d078b,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:15:47 2015 UTC,"Ah yes that is an effect commonly associated with champagne. The longer the alcohol sits in the same container at the sediment and dead yeast, the more rounded the flavor will be l. The highest quality champagnes sit on what is called the ""lees"" for up to ten years. I similar effect happened to you mead I'm sure."

As you can probably tell, I tried to experiment with the ullage a bit with some mixed results, this was due to these new punted bottles not filling up a tad above the neck like I'm used to. Oh well, that's how we learn."

mead,3cz9bh,TheHobbitPimp,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:39:27 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's closer in taste to a red wine than a mead due to tannins from the mulberry stems and the mulberry flavor itself (the closest fruit I can compare the flavor to are figs).  Add in some tartness and a hint of flavor from the plums and a good vanilla character.    The honey doesn't really shine through, or at least I can't perceive it, but I think that was just because it was a poor OB honey I got from an apiary in Texas.  The alcohol is apparent as well, but at 13.8% ABV, I'm not surprised one bit."

This originally finished 1.004 and that is the state it went into the blend.  Then I backsweetened the remainder to ~1.016 Pineapple Ginger, delicious.  ABV 14.0%. I backsweetened twice with honey and pineapple juice, ending at 1.014.    edit: I guess the pineapple ginger is < 14% now since I backsweetened with some juice twice.  I'll have to check my notes and do the math but it was 14% before that."

It's always described as toasted marshmallow, and that's not really wrong.  Finished product in my case is more like mildly spicy/smoky vanilla, as I recall.  This particular batch did not want to clear so I hit it with sparkolloid, which did 95% of it but it still had some very fine haze visible with a flashlight so I ended up filtering it.  I still have about 5 pounds of the honey, I'm thinking it might go well in an acerglyn or a braggot.  I would say go for it, hard to imagine not liking Meadowfoam."

I looked at DIY ones but I'd still need somewhere to store it afterwards which would be an issue.  Instead, we're going to borrow a juicer or find one cheap on craigslist and use it.  We also read that you can take the leftover bits and squeeze them through a mesh bag to get even more liquid from the apples.  As far as sterilization goes, using 1 campden tablet per 1 gallon of cider and letting it sit for 24 hours should handle all the sterilization.  Pectin can be fixed by adding about 3/4 tsp of pectic enzyme per gallon."

mead,3cqxfy,i_forget_my_userids,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:18:11 2015 UTC,"for 1 year.  On the second question, we usually attach an airlock to the top of a fermentor. I was wondering if I can, instead, attach a blowoff tube to the side, above the level of the mead, of course. This way I can pile up a couple of fermentors."
mead,3cqxfy,balathustrius,3,Fri Jul 10 04:14:18 2015 UTC,"I only use plastic, have about the same time frame on a lot of stuff. You're fine. There's a study of there about how little o2 is let in through pet vs other things, like opening the airlock to take a sample."

mead,3cpi9a,2lazyforthis,5,Thu Jul 9 19:02:59 2015 UTC,"Growing yeast is very simple. I do it all the time to make starters. You (sort of) do it every time you make mead or brew beer. To do it commercially just requires scaling up the equipment. For optimal conditions, you need a nutrient rich medium, a way to keep the medium well oxygenated, and a way to control the temperature.   Culturing yeast, whether it be from wild sources like fruit, or from the bottom of a bottle of beer, or from an agar plate like how I keep my yeast library, begins the same way. You need to isolate a pure culture, or colony. One way to do this is to streak a plate with agar growth medium and then let it grow for a day or two at about 30°C (room temp works just fine). Individual colonies of yeast will start to appear. Next, using a sterile tool, a single colony is picked to be grown up. You can also pick multiple colonies, with the idea being that they might be slightly different. Those yeast colonies are placed into a small volume of liquid medium. Sterile beer wort works just fine, but commercial labs might use something called Sabouraud medium that contains nutrients. The small liquid culture is shaken to oxygenate and grown for a time, then added to a larger volume of medium, and grown again. This keeps the yeast culture in a state of exponential growth. Finally, when the culture is large enough and ready for packaging, the yeast are centrifuged to concentrate them, counted under a microscope, then diluted to equal numbers with an extra rich medium before being packaged as liquid a liquid culture, or freeze dried for a dry yeast package.  If you're interested in keeping your own yeast library I can give you some more information."
mead,3cpi9a,theheartguy,2,Fri Jul 10 01:03:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this is definitely helpful. A yeast library is something I'm interested in but won't be able to do for some time as I'm restricted by both space and money. Do you know how a strain is isolated to begin with? Say I want to start producing EC-1118 on a commercial scale, am I swabbing in a winery known to have that yeast or is everything derived from yeast banks at this point?"
mead,3cpi9a,theheartguy,2,Fri Jul 10 16:24:09 2015 UTC,"You're right that at this point, pretty much all commercially available yeast is grown from banks. New strains are mainly developed in laboratories by combing desirable characteristics of known strains and using selective pressure to push them into something new. But breweries still use wild yeast all the time. If you visit a Trappist monastery, or traditional Belgian brewery that makes lambic, you'll see they use open fermentation vessels. Resident yeast that live in the brewery just fall in to the wort and start the fermentation. Since it's not a pure strain of S. cerevisiae, but instead also contains some bacteria and other wild yeast strains like S. pombe, the result is a funky, sour, sometime barnyard like flavor profile. Likewise, traditional wineries would ferment their wine with native yeast living on the grape skins.  At some point, people realized that they could culture the magic and get more consistent results. Did you know that the original Reinheitsgebot, the German Purity law, only allowed beer to include water, barley, and hops? After Louis Pasteur came along, they had to amend the Reinheitsgebot to include yeast. People knew for a while that one could reuse the trub at the bottom of a fermentation vessel to ferment another batch. Now add the idea that the microorganisms living there were the guys doing the work, and you can see where this is going.  It's still possible to isolate and culture wild yeast. You can have your own strain of yeast that you isolated from your home. You might not like what you isolate, but then again you might strike gold. You can either leave out some sterile must or beer wort and just let it happen au naturale, or use a sterile cotton swab to sample some local fruit trees and other surfaces, then either steak them on agar plates or drop them in a small liquid culture. I recommend the agar plates so that you can isolate a single colony instead of having a mix of yeast and bacteria."

Any books in particular that you recommend (aside from the one mentioned below)?

mead,3cogv8,Bunsomel,2,Thu Jul 9 16:14:33 2015 UTC,"I have the original vacuum wine transfer pump deluxe setup.  I've never used it, TBH - all the things I would use it for I've come to the conclusion are better done with other means.  I've discovered the sterile siphon starter and (thankfully) I have an able body to lift buckets and carboys - his has always done the trick faster, easier, and with less cleanup.  I can buy a roll of siphon hose and throw old hoses away without thinking twice.  The SS racking cane makes the setup even more awesome-r.    One benefit to the vacuum transfer pumps is that you don't have to lift carboys anymore.  I've never found it great for transferring from a primary ferment with mash (fruit, skins, and seeds + liquid) - so it is of limited use to me.  A 'SiphonTap' (you can get them on eBay) is much better.  Someday I'll get around to prototyping my ideal home setup for this process, and it may integrate the vacuum pump at that time, but probably not, honestly.  I like the simplicity and affordability of the sterile siphon starter setup - I just want to marry a SiphonTap-like attachment to a setup similar to that - figuring out a way to start a siphon reliably in the mash environment without clogging.  I've tried the unholy mating of the auto siphon to the SiphonTap, but it isn't ideal and leaves a very wet mash in the bucket (something inconsequential if you have a wine press, but I prefer the flavor of free-run wine).  This is an ongoing area of experimentation for me."

Sometimes you end up discovering a fix for a problem you didn't realize existed.  But here, I'm not sure I understand exactly what problem you're solving.

mead,3cn773,nest_menace,14,Thu Jul 9 05:23:15 2015 UTC,"For what part of mead making do you think a fridge is necessary?  For fermentation, you want to be in the low 60s (up to the low-mid 70s in a pinch). You can control that temperature with a swamp cooler. That's something you can google or search for on here or /r/homebrewing.  You don't have to cold crash mead if you plan your recipes well. Usually, the goal of cold crashing is to stop the yeast from continuing fermentation, in order to preserve sweetness in a mead. However, if you choose a yeast that goes to a particular tolerance and provide the right amount of nutrition, you can max out the yeast more or less on your expected ABV target, then stabilize with potassium metabisulfite (and possibly potassium sorbate), and backsweeten after that.  As for clearing, time will do that for you without cooling. If not, a dual-punch fining like Super-Kleer K.C. certainly will. (But learn about pectin haze if you intend to use fruit. Again, no refrigeration necessary, but time and finings won't help the normal way.)  The biggest reason to have a fridge is to make sparkling mead via forced keg carbonation."
mead,3cn773,balathustrius,2,Thu Jul 9 05:52:53 2015 UTC,"via forced keg carbonation.   Yep, that's why I've done it. Super Kleer K.C. + (Capden tablets + potassium sorbate in the keg) = super clear force carbed mead (like, it feels like pro quality)"

Wait for a cool period, you can use a large ballast to keep the temperature constant and to alter it, but keeping a demijohn in your bath for a couple of weeks is a bit impractical."

mead,3cmt0b,Coffinspire,5,Thu Jul 9 03:09:10 2015 UTC,The latest best practice is to not heat the must as this drives off some of the delicate aromas.  Warm the honey and water up to fermentation temp and mix it with a power drill.  I have never use an oak barrel so I'm not sure if the mead / wine should be mostly clear before it goes in for aging.  So pre aging in glass and racking clear might be the way to go?

mead,3cmdw3,DarthWingo91,4,Thu Jul 9 01:06:24 2015 UTC,"Got way too much lees into the carboy.   Don't worry about that. For the volumes homebrewers work with, it isn't an issue. You can always just leave it behind at the next racking.   Impatience lead to using Super Kleer and after another week   After a month is a little quick but probably fine. I think I've done as short as 3 weeks.   Don't take so many tastings.   As you do this more, that'll come naturally. I don't think I've pulled a sample for myself just to taste (when not otherwise racking or sweetening) in months. I still like to give guests the in-progress experience, though.   Also, get more honey to backsweeten. I like dry, but I know many don't, so I'd like to try a sweeter one.    My advice is to sweeten like this - though it works best if you have a small hydrometer cylinder or refractometer. Otherwise change ""1/2 cup"" to ""3/4 cup"". For this, don't worry about sanitation except for your wine thief, because none of the sample should be going back into your carboy.   Pull and set aside baseline sample. Half oz or so. Pull out 1/2 cup. Stir in tsp of honey.  Gently pour into cylinder and take gravity reading.  Set aside a half oz or so of that, labeled with the gravity. Repeat 1-5 until you don't have enough sample left for gravity readings. Try them all, figure out the two you like best. Then think about which one of those you'd prefer a whole glass of. Congrats, that's your gravity target for backsweetening. If you can't decide, get your SO, friend, or parent to make the call. Or flip a coin. Combine all other samples into one glass and finish 'er off.    May try step adding Fermax instead of adding it all at once.   SNA is definitely the way to go.   All in all, I'm very pleased with this batch and can't wait to try more.   Glad you had a good first experience!"

mead,3cmdw3,balathustrius,2,Thu Jul 9 02:33:02 2015 UTC,"I'd flavor it with a strong spice.  In general terms:   19-20 pounds orange blossom honey (edit: for 5 gallons of mead) Spice*  Backsweeten to 1.020-.1030 (or whatever you like).   The spice can be added to taste after fermentation, backsweetening, and clarification. Steep a little at a time until you reach the desired level of intensity. If you use sanitized mesh bags anchored outside the carboy (just run a line out the opening and shove the bung in on top of it), you can pull them out and replace the spices every week for a high level of control.  Edit: I really like juniper berries in strong sweet mead. But any spice normally paired with high sweetness (like cinnamon) would work well."

mead,3cgfql,idownvotepunstoo,5,Tue Jul 7 19:34:59 2015 UTC,"Infections can have different smells that they make (like green apple or vinegar and more). They can also make a floating thing called a pellicle. I would say you're fine. Looks like you just have some yeast stuck to the side of the glass and maybe a couple yeast rafts. If you're fermentation had some foaming, then when the foam died down it would have left some yeast behind."

mead,3cgfql,Skywyse,3,Tue Jul 7 21:10:46 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're using time to clarify or that clarification is an objective: let it clarify, then rack to a clean container for bottling.   It's what I normally do for clarity, and it'll work. If clarity is not a goal, then I'd let it de-gas a little longer and then you should be clear to do with it as you will for storage."
mead,3cgfql,zofoandrew,2,Wed Jul 8 17:11:48 2015 UTC,It definitely has a strong smell but it's a alcohol/yeasty smell ( my batch is on the more potent side so I'm expecting a decently strong aroma lol)

mead,3cgfql,Blacksburg,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:18:54 2015 UTC,"Looks like nothing more than a yeast bed, I wouldn't worry too much about that. You will however get an odd smell from the bed. I would use a wine thief to get a better assesment. You can also very lightly rotate your 1gl in angled circles to swirl the mix, but be carefully to not mix to much or to fast an create air bubbles, we don't want to get air in the mix during aging. Keep your airlock full and if its done fermenting you won't see any action. As far as the strong alcohol smell, that may go away with aging(depending on how high your original gravity was, it may take longer to age)."
mead,3ce1vf,dofartshavelumps,5,Tue Jul 7 04:39:22 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of yeast, adding honey can be a bit of a shock to the yeast so give it a few more days and check your gravity if you still don't see activity in your airlock."

mead,3cccys,gundog48,3,Tue Jul 7 02:16:27 2015 UTC,My brew buddy sanitizes in his dishwasher. I've also heard of people putting bottles in the oven on 175-200 for an hour to sanitize.
mead,3cccys,SouthernMurse,2,Mon Jul 6 21:15:28 2015 UTC,"sanitizing is always best, but if you trust your tap water to not be infested with crap, it may work just as well to give your bottles a thorough rinse at the hottest temp it can make.  Also you will find instructions out there for making bleach-based sanitizer (hint: it's very diluted), if you want to just be extra-careful and stuff.  It's something like 1 TBSP bleach to a gallon of water, but please refer elsewhere for the exact measurement."
mead,3cccys,Falco98,2,Mon Jul 6 20:56:28 2015 UTC,"There's good advice in this thread, but I feel the need to point something out here that may or may not be obvious to all: cleaning and sanitizing are two different things.  You must clean before you sanitize!  Your question says ""low on sanitizer for cleaning"" and that totally freaks me out.  Use something (good suggestions in this thread, personally I use PBW) to clean, then, use something (I use StarSan and am afraid to use bleach anymore) to sanitize.  In that order!"
mead,3cccys,ThatMeadGuy,2,Wed Jul 8 21:18:26 2015 UTC,Clean them normally. Rinse well. Then bake them at 350 for a few hours. Put them in a cold oven. Turn it on. Turn it off a few hours later. WAIT for the oven to cool entirely. Do NOT put the bottles into a warm oven. Do NOT take the bottles out of a warm oven. If you do you risk explosive glass. But when done properly you will sanitize your bottles without the use of sanitizer at all. A dry heat over 240 should kill everything including spores. To be extra careful I cap each bottle with a piece of tin foil while they bake.

mead,3c8lmo,i_forget_my_userids,3,Sun Jul 5 23:32:53 2015 UTC,Aging and clearing are different things. Higher alcohol meads usually do take longer to age. Everything usually takes about the same time to clear.

mead,3c8lmo,Tychus_Kayle,3,Tue Jul 7 01:09:25 2015 UTC,"Here's the original post for the sake of credit, but here's my slightly revised version.  Stuff you need:   Number of batches you want to make + 1 1-gallon containers (ideally glass jugs)  Some way to seal these containers water-tight so you can shake them (e.g. a rubber stopper)  Lavin EC-1118 yeast (1 packet per gallon batch)  2.5 lbs honey per gallon batch  1 cup fruit (blackberries work particularly well) per gallon batch  Stuff I highly recommend: airlocks, an auto-siphon + tubing, a bottling wand, rinse-free sterilizing agent (e.g. starsan), potassium sorbate  Day 1: put honey, fruit*, and water (leaving some head room) in clean (ideally sterilized) jugs, shake vigorously 'till honey and water are well mixed, dump in a packet of yeast (do not bother rehydrating/awakening this yeast, just dump it in, though if you've been keeping it in the fridge you should take it out the day before you start), shake again.  Day 2-7: shake vigorously at least once per day, give it a few shakes (literally up and down 3 times at first) before carefully allowing gas to escape, then reseal and repeat 'till it doesn't foam very much. BE CAREFUL, you WILL make a mess if you aren't, and will probably make a small mess your first few times.  Day 8: shake as before, but your final shake shouldn't be too late in the day  Day 9: let it sit  Day 10: ideally a full 48 hours after you last shook it, transfer mead to a clean (ideally sterilized) container by siphon or careful pouring and straining (you want to minimize the fruit and sediment that gets into the new container). Add potassium sorbate if you have it, shake. Now, regardless of whether you added sorbate, put the jug in your fridge (I recommend putting a stopper on it, but not quite airtight, to reduce the amount of fridge air that gets in).  Day 11: let it sit  Day 12: bottle it  Keep it in the fridge after bottling, it's bottled with live yeast below alcohol tolerance. The refrigeration and recommended potassium sorbate will delay and slow resumed fermentation, but I strongly recommend you drink your mead within a few weeks of bottling. It should probably be fine for a few months, but exploding bottles are bad, so I stay on the safe side.  *Fruit with a thick skin (such as cherries) should be cut. I don't mean chopped into pieces, I mean that if you're doing a cherry batch, give each one a big gash with a knife to let the yeast in, the yeast will do the rest. Weaker fruit (like blackberries) doesn't need this. Larger fruit (apples, oranges, peaches, whatever) should be cut into pieces regardless of skin thickness.  EDIT 99: I recommend rinsing the stopper in sterilizing fluid before starting, and between batches, each day."

I know a lot of people don't have the patience for it, but I highly recommend just letting it rest in the carboy. Rack it about every 6 months or more. You can bottle it at the one year mark, but I've found that there is still fine fallout happening in the bottle when I do that. Mine is very tasty after a year. Clear too...

Are you rehydrating? With GoFerm or similar rehydration nutrient?   Ultimately, if you're getting sulfur and the other variables are accounted-for, you may as well try increasing the YAN.  But no, I wouldn't assume that pitch rate has anything to do with it unless you're severely under- or over-pitching. Maybe you are, I'm not sure.  A good pitch rate is generally enough that the yeast have to reproduce 2-5 times, if my math is correct. I'm not sure of the effects of going over that."

I've never used that yeast but it and most Red Star are listed as good up to 86F so you're around the upper end already.  C: Possibly.  I think you want to above 3.0 basically otherwise consider intervening (probably back up to low-to-mid 3's) but that is just my understanding, not really based on experience.   Also note the pH does drop as fermentation happens.    I had one batch sluggish that I suspected pH, took a reading, it seemed low.  So I added some potassium carbonate (as I recall).

I later figured out the fermenter wasn't tightly sealed so I fixed that and never revisited the pH.  D: I assume you pitched more of the same yeast.  I have no idea experience with that yeast so don't know if it will start in a currently-11% ABV must.

And yes many return to the carboy some dont. One thing to consider is making 1.5 gallons of wine to start after racking it will end up as less

Check out my recipe log for ideas and examples of the process. Steal/modify/etc the template and keep your own logs if you like.  White Papers and other resources. See especially Getting Started: Equipment. See also Weight to Volume conversions - that should also be invaluable for a newbie if you don't have a gram scale. A lot of the best recipes (recipes created by the best in the business) are given by weight."

Pre fermentation we use a Refractometer Literally drops on to it. Alcohol distorts the reading after fermentation has begun. That might help you out to save on 1 gallon batches. It is also a time saver. Keep in mind though, it is best for pre fermentation gravity readings."
mead,3c3sc9,mahalambda,3,Sat Jul 4 14:20:36 2015 UTC,"Bottling with priming sugar is the way to go. You'll get some sediment, though. Watch a video on how they purge the sediment from champagne, and you can make it more clear. They use dry ice and fast hands.   You'll never be able to stay carbonated in an airlocked carboy. Alternatively, you can bulk age in carboy, bottle, then prime. How long are you talking about aging?"

mead,3c3sc9,i_forget_my_userids,2,Sat Jul 4 15:02:56 2015 UTC,"The only thing I have to add to this is the obvious ""don't put hot water in your carboy; let the sugar solution cool first.""  Alternatively, you can just measure the sugar and add it to your bottles without dissolving it in anything."
mead,3c3sc9,Krinberry,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:08:49 2015 UTC,"I find it's less of a pain to do it in the carboy; for one, you don't need to fiddle with every bottle, and this way you also get a more consistent amount of sugar and yeast (I always throw in a dry pack, they costs less than $2, well worth the peace of mind) in each bottle so you don't need to worry about some being duds and others rockets.  One thing to keep in mind with bottles though, you have to use the right type of bottles, with the right corks; you'll be wanting to look for champaign or beer bottles, not typical wine bottles."

mead,3c3sc9,psyberneo,2,Sat Jul 4 18:27:12 2015 UTC,I use the same process as bottling beer. I agree all my meads for at least a year.  Add priming sugar or honey and yeast to bottling bucket with Mead. Stir and then bottle.

Buy a whole lot of fermenters. As much as it can be tempting to bottle a cloudy batch to free up a fermenter, let it clear before you bottle.

When they do have it in stock, it usually consists of two dusty random bottles hidden on a shelf somewhere.    We just had a huge high end liquor store open up.  When I asked for it they still gave me the 2 head look, but the manager finally pulled through and showed me to the promise land.

I'm not a big fan of wine, I've tried $800 bottles at fine restaurants and honestly would have preferred a good beer instead.  Wine leaves an acidic aftertaste that I've never liked.  However I've always liked mead because of its sweetness and lack of acidic aftertaste.  However it has been very hard to find and the brand that I found the most of was Oliver.  So I would not consider myself well versed in meads currently.  I never detected any acidity with the Bunratti.  It had a medium thickness, and a unique herbal taste to it.  I honestly have trouble describing the taste itself but it hits you up front and is very distinct.  However it fades quickly and leaves a smooth sweet aftertaste."

This breaks down the cell walls and gives the yeast an easier time getting at the natural sugars.  Sanitation is also a concern, especially if they're fresh-picked. My intuition is that racking onto them in secondary mitigates most of your problems - the alcohol content already present in the mead will knock out most anything growing on the fruit.

Then, I got lazy one year and skipped it, and have continued to skip it every time since.  Personally, I've not had a problem.  FWIW I use D-47 on most of my fruit melomels, and I put all of my fruit into primary in most cases.    Anecdotal evidence, obviously.  I'm a lazy mazer!"
mead,3bx5pc,ThatMeadGuy,2,Thu Jul 2 22:21:25 2015 UTC,I have never once sanitized fruit outside of freezing either. Certainly never had an infection.
mead,3bx5pc,StormBeforeDawn,2,Thu Jul 2 22:50:08 2015 UTC,"Wash them, freeze them, thaw them in sanitized vessel, rack onto them.  Done.  Or just do steps 1-3 in primary - just make sure you have healthy yeast on their way past about 12% ABV."
mead,3bx5pc,JamesAGreen,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:29:01 2015 UTC,I always pasteurize my fruit. My method is puree or mash up fruit and bring temp up to 170°F and hold for 5 minutes. Let cool and add to secondary.
mead,3bv8hk,gundog48,3,Thu Jul 2 12:46:44 2015 UTC,Awesome labels!
mead,3bv8hk,rocking2rush10,2,Thu Jul 2 13:39:39 2015 UTC,I am super jealous of well done labels. I don't even cork mine wines yet :(   I need a real job to pay for this hobby.
mead,3bv8hk,StormBeforeDawn,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:57:09 2015 UTC,"Packaging may be the cheapest bit! Use some old wine bottles, use the screw caps if they have them, if they're corked then they're better I'd say! You can buy a good solid corker for around £15 or one of the really cheap ones that require a lot more work for considerably less, then all you really have to do is buy some corks which are cheap enough. So up to £15 up front and a little bit for corks each time!  Labelling is as simple as designing your label, printing and sticking it!"
mead,3bv8hk,StormBeforeDawn,2,Thu Jul 2 19:59:16 2015 UTC,"I have very a triple dozen of nice matching 22's and I like to bottle in them. Also, you mistake me for someone who buys wine. I am a little biased, but I think my wine is much better than any 15$ bottle of wine from a store, and buying a bunch of bottles just to reuse is kinda meh. I could have bought 750ml instead of 22's but I couldn't bottle carbonate safely then.   There is no difference between corking/caping for storing under 1-2 years from everything I have read, but that's not really related I suppose. Screwcaps are right out though. you cannot reuse those without oxidization. Hell, they are not even water tight sometimes after you break the seal.   As for the label, well THAT is me being lazy I suppose. I just don't care enough to do it, I just mark the crowns so i can tell it all apart."
mead,3bv8hk,StormBeforeDawn,2,Thu Jul 2 22:32:51 2015 UTC,"Fair enough! I think caps are far more low maintenance and probably work out better than corking, though don't' quote me there! You can carb up easily, you don't have to worry about the cork drying out or going bad and spoiling your wine. The other thing is that opening a 750ml bottle feels like a commitment, and you don't want to leave it half empty for long, but I could happily finish a 500ml bottle on my own!  I was thinking more about scrounging old bottles off friends or even hitting the bottle banks, that's what I've done in the past when I've been short. After a while just decided that the time spent removing labels and glue gunk to get a mismatched bunch of bottles just wasn't worth it! Just bought a load of corked plain bottles and I've been reusing them over and over!"

Each batch of blueberry mead I make gets 18lbs in primary.  The berries are frozen before use, regardless of how fresh they are, to break up the cell walls and get a better extraction.  When you hit the must with a lees stirrer, the berries get torn up pretty good.  You get great color and flavor extraction from your fruit this way.  I use D-47, which I keep at 59f for the duration of the ferment.  After 7-10 days, I rack to secondary, removing the fruit material at the same time.  A year later, I've got some of the best mead I've ever made.  I've been doing this for most of a decade now, every year.  So much blueberry mead goodness.  Don't go adding straight sugar to mead.  It'll reduce the already-weak mouthfeel while taking away the potential to get more honey flavor up in there.  You don't need to make a syrup, that's just a bunch of extra work."

I really like Traquair Jacobite Ale which uses coriander, and I've noticed I like other beers with coriander so I've been keen to use it.

But I followed the recipe (for the most part, I used EC-1118) and it's pretty good as is  edit: My recipe (~3 gallons) was: - 10.8 lbs Gunter's wildflower honey - 2.5 large oranges, juice and zest - .6 lbs dates and figs (frozen first) - 2-3 vanilla beans - 5.4 oz candied ginger, chopped - .3 oz juniper berries, crushed in mortar and pestle - .6 Tbsp cinnamon, Ceylon, crushed - .6 tsp nutmeg - .6 tsp cardamom, crushed - .6 tsp allspice - 10g EC-1118, rehydrated with 12.5g GoFerm     Pomegranate Date Fig - This was just winging it, experiment. -1.5 gallons.     80oz pomegranate juice 3.5 lbs local wildflower honey 1/2 lb dates (previously frozen, thawed, trimmed and cut, etc) 1/2 lb figs (previously frozen, thawed, trimmed and cut, etc) 1/2 tsp pectin enzyme 10g 71B-1122 rehydrated in 12.5g GoFerm   fermented to 1.000 then back sweetened with ~1/3 lb honey, ~.8 lbs dates, ~.45 lbs figs  Final gravity at bottling was ~1.022, 15.1% ABV     Leatherwood traditional - ~ 5 liters   70.5 oz Tasmanian Leatherwood honey  ~3 oz Gunter's wildflower to raise gravity a bit 10g 71B-1122, rehydrated in 12.5g GoFerm   Fermented to 1.000, backsweetened with ~6 oz Leatherwood honey to ~1.013, ~15.8% ABV"

mead,3bph9u,ThatMeadGuy,2,Wed Jul 1 07:45:41 2015 UTC,"I only drank the excess that didn't make it into a bottle so it's hard to say yet.  I think it'd be better backsweetened more so the sweetness can balance out that specific eucalyptus-y taste of leatherwood.  However, I'm trying to train my palate down to lower gravities and I'm really resisting the urge to go to obvious sweet higher gravities and trying to stick to < 1.020-ish for the time being.  But it's definitely a honey with character and it was good enough that I decided to bottle.  If it was a larger batch I may have gone a bit sweeter or done some blending, etc."

mead,3bpqj9,smashedpunker,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:01:35 2015 UTC,"IMO do not use the potassium metabisulfite unless and until you are ready for the fermentation to  potentially stop, which you are not if it's 1.050.  Potassium Metabisulfite is optionally used as 1 of 2 additions (with potassium sorbate) to try to stop a fermentation (or stabilize before backsweetening) and it's also optionally used as an antioxidant during racking and prior to bottling.  Stay the course, maybe add some yeast nutrients if you haven't yet.  Traditionals can stall out without nutrients because honey is very nutrient poor despite being sugar rich.  You are probably OK if it's been going 2 weeks but it depends on what gravity you started with."
mead,3bpqj9,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:16:28 2015 UTC,"like a dummy i forgot to take a OG reading so i dont know what I started at. :( but i did feed it with nutrients a week into primary. so do need to put that stuff in? will it eventually stop fermentation on its own? the recipe says to let it sit for a month, then rack and top up sit for 2 months rack and top up then sit for 3 moths and bottle."
mead,3bpqj9,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,2,Wed Jul 1 12:45:14 2015 UTC,"It will stop fermentation when it runs out of sugar, or when the yeast die off or go dormant due to too much alcohol present or due to lack of nutrients.  So yes it will stop on its own eventually.  Hard to say if you should add any nutrients as we have no idea of your starting gravity or recipe, or how much you used already.  If you started at 1.100 then 1.050 indicates a pretty healthy fermentation is underway.  If you started at 1.070 then two weeks in its a pretty poor fermentation.   The downside of fermenting with insufficient nutrients, even if it finishes fermenting, is the yeast are stressed out and produce off flavors and fusel alcohols and it just takes longer to age out.  edit: those timeframes are flexible and it's up to the brewer when to rack and how long to age.  I rack a few times then let it sit until at least the 6 month mark, personally.  But I've bottled some at the 3 month mark in the past.   Those are a good rule of thumb, though.  I'd personally rack at least twice total, around the 1 month and 2 month mark,  then consider back sweetening, bottling, etc around the 3 month mark.  Longer if you have the patience but it's tough waiting on that first batch."

Thanks the help is much appreciated so its been 3 days and its bubbling like crazy  heres a pic http://i.imgur.com/FBOOlP7.jpg i attached a blowoff tube because it was foaming up so much. what do i do for back sweetening just mix more honey and water together and throw it in? wont that cause fermentation to continue? unless all the yeast has died right?"
mead,3bpqj9,i_forget_my_userids,2,Fri Jul 3 23:06:10 2015 UTC,"Looks good.  Good idea doing a blowoff.  To backsweeten, yes, add more honey.  You either have to max the yeast out first or stabilize or they will keep fermenting.  To stabilize, search the sub but basically you use 1 potassium metabisulfite tablet (campden tablet) per gallon, crushed.  And 1/2tsp potassium sorbate per gallon.  You have to dissolve the sorbate in a few ounces of near boiling water first.  I usually do backsweetening and stabilizing the same way now.  I take a 1/2 gallon Pyrex measuring cup, sanitize it, and wine thief out a few cups of the mead, like maybe 32 ounces.  Add the honey for backsweetening or the stabilizers, dissolve/stir, add those to a new carboy and rack onto them.  If you only have this container you'll have to add back into this container and use something sanitized to mix it up, or shake it up I suppose."
mead,3bpqj9,balathustrius,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:51:46 2015 UTC,Sulfites do not effectively or permanently stop fermentation. The yeast can recover.  Sorbate doesn't necessarily stop fermentation either. It effectively neuters the yeast and prevents reproduction.  Using the two in conjunction with each other is effective at stopping fermentation.
mead,3bpqj9,balathustrius,2,Wed Jul 1 04:20:51 2015 UTC,3.1. Sometimes.
mead,3bp231,darthKOTOR,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:08:44 2015 UTC,"not sure what fermax is, but as long as your dosage adds up to the manufacturers recommended dosage you should be fine.   I find it odd that you have your fermentation temperature sussed but not your yeast... also, 64f sounds low to me and could slow down the fermentation, which brings me to my next thought:  3 months may be pushing it for time from pitch to bottling, cold crashing can get yeast to go dormant, but doesn't completely negate their ability to wake back up. if you plan on halting fermentation you should plan to use sorbate/sulfites to guard against bottle bombs. and if you're going to sorbate/sulfite, why not build your recipe to ferment out to 1.000 at your desired abv, and then backsweeten after stabilization?   great mead starts with great honey. bland mead could probably get woken up with either some adjunct ingredients for flavor, and even acid blend after backsweetening can help brighten up dull flavors.   edit: my favorite yeast to work with (and seems very popular for /r/mead) is Lalvin 71B."

I can ferment higher, not a problem.   The cold crash is to clear it. I am hoping it will be completely fermented by then.  I don't mind aging it longer in the carboy, I just figured 2-3 weeks would be enough to hit FG, then cold crash to clear it up."

mead,3bp231,SHv2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:31:05 2015 UTC,"Because it's procedure for beer. I was under the impression that aging came with multiple rackings. So at 8 months mark you are on your third carboy. That's how I have heard other people doing it (rack a totally of 3-4 times over the course of a year). I just figured a few months, then a few months cold crash, then a few months in bottles would be good. I'm open though."
mead,3bp231,SHv2,2,Wed Jul 1 15:38:27 2015 UTC,"You really only need to rack it once after a primary fermentation is finished and the yeast has mostly settled. Once it's in secondary you're really just aging/clearing. After that goes for as long as you want then you can put it into bottles and have at it.  There really isn't a reason to cold crash.  Personally I do primary for 3-6 months, secondary for 3-6 months, bottle. Granted I do 60 gallon batches in prmary racked off to a bunch of 6 gallon carboys for secondary where I add fruit/spices/etc. From there I wait 3-6 months for things to infuse/age before putting them in bottles. At the point of it going into bottles it's totally ready to drink."

mead,3bp231,SHv2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:47:54 2015 UTC,"The biggest factors will be, in order:   The honey you use The yeast you use Ambient temperature   With your recipe, my critiques would be:  You don't know what temperature to ferment at until you know your yeast, unless you specifically pick your yeast based on the known temperature.   Bulk aging is almost always preferable to bottle aging. After cold crashing and racking to the next container, let it bulk age longer. It will continue to get clearer and clearer while the flavors mature and round out together to give you a more consistent product between bottles.   You want a semi-sweet mead with that recipe? Pick a yeast that will finish (alcohol tolerance) at around 13%.  If you're not rushing bottling, don't take that any gravity readings for like 2 or 3 months."
mead,3bp231,SHv2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:59:21 2015 UTC,"Sounds good. How long should I let it sit in primary?

mead,3bp231,Sauerkrause,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:19:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah that yeast should be fine; the temperature range is broad on that one.   You should stir daily during primary with a sanitized spoon; this will kick out dissolved CO2. After the fourth day, start taking gravity readings with your sterilized hydrometer. Move to secondary container after gravity drops below 1.04.   That number is flexible, and I rarely take hydrometer readings anymore between primary and secondary. I only test at pitch and at bottling. If you don't want to take a hydrometer reading, stop stirring after day 3 and transfer to secondary on more or less day 6.   Time 0 is the when you pitch yeast."

mead,3bmch3,darthKOTOR,3,Tue Jun 30 13:28:07 2015 UTC,"Keep clean! Infections have a small chance of tastiness. Research for a good recipe. Making your own recipe is nice, but it's handy to try your hand at a tried and true recipe first. This way, you have a safe guide and you don't have to handle unexpected surprises. Make sure you have all the right equipment. A carboy is vital, but so is Star San, a beer thief, a hydrometer, a graduated cylinder (to put the hydrometer in), at least one very large pot, a thermometer for the pot, a sieve to clear goop off the top of the must while it's heating, yeast nutrients, etc.  Get everything together first.In cooking it's called your mise en place - or as I always say, your ""mess in place"". This means you get your measurements ready before hand as well as all your tools. It takes some extra time, but it's much less of a headache if you see before you start what you may be missing. Measure regularly. Depending on how long you intend to ferment, your yeast, your amount of honey, etc., a solid steady level of measurement will let you know how it's going. I'd recommend right before putting it in the carboy, 1 week later, then 1/3 the fermentation time, then 2/3, then before you stop fermentation. This will give you a good idea of the progress. With that, I recommend a spreadsheet on [drive.google.com](drive.google.com) Kind of like this one so you can keep your notes somewhere safe and consistent (That one's for the mead above). Make it how you think is best! The Links in the sidebar of this subreddit are darned handy. Use them! Foam is NOT always infection Google images will save you time and anxiety. A large number of people post images of foam on their mead asking ""is this infected?"" Signs of infection are good to know and it never hurts to be careful. Either way, remember to just ride the wave and see what happens. Sometimes pleasant surprises await you!   That's about all I can think of. If there's anything else, let me know! I'm going to tell you, though, I'm definitely no master mazer or anything, so if one's around and they tell you otherwise, this random internet stranger's probably trumped. XD"

Aeration and de-gassing might help more. There's enough yeast there and it shouldn't be dead (which yeast did you use?)   can I add more pectic enzyme to break down this apple/cloudiness?

mead,3bh1us,TheComposer_84,2,Mon Jun 29 15:38:14 2015 UTC,"With some vegetable wines, the veg (such as beetroot or carrot) are boiled for 20-30 minutes in water before the resulting liquid is strained onto sugar (with some acid blend, or oranges/lemons and black tea etc).  You could strain the liquid and mix with honey for a mead. For somewhat tested results you can look for recipe's for those specific vegetable wines and simply use honey as the sugar source. Here is a recipe for sweet potato wine on jack keller's website.  I made Carrot wine and it is very nice; easily fools plenty of people into thinking it was made with grapes."

mead,3bf4p0,i_forget_my_userids,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:00:13 2015 UTC,"Before I pitched the RED STAR MONTRACHET rehydrated yeast, I added the Brewers Best yeast nutrient (I used what the directions say, I think 1 teaspoon/gallon) and shook the must up for about 5 minutes. After the first few days I slowly rocked the mead back and forth for a couple minutes. I took several gravity readings, basically once a week using a refractometer, but I can't remember what they were, just that they were decreasing each time. The last two were the same though. If by degas you mean mean open the fermenter, yes, when I took my weekly readings and didn't write them down."
mead,3bf4p0,i_forget_my_userids,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:27:47 2015 UTC,"Okay, well if your specific gravity is below 1.002, it finished fermenting okay. The thing I'm talking about for the first few days is basically stirring/agitating it with a giant, sanitized spoon for a couple seconds.   My best guess is it's not finished fermenting. Is it slightly cloudy or extremely clear? Have you been storing it in the fridge or at room temp? Is it naturally carbonated right now?"
mead,3bf4p0,i_forget_my_userids,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:32:20 2015 UTC,"Its a little cloudy. I didn't use any fining agents, just bottled. I didn't add any extra sugar, so it isn't carbonated. I put it in the refrigerator for a day. After bottling, it's been sitting in my basement at about 63F."
mead,3bf4p0,DeathtoPants,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:49:07 2015 UTC,Yeah it isn't finished. You didn't have to add extra sugar to carbonate it. The unfermented sugar is already in there. You tasted it and said it was quite sweet. It might end up carbonating in those bottles or the yeast quit on you. It needs to ferment further if you want it to be less sweet. Getting it back into a carboy and re-pitching is about the only thing you can do if you want to resolve it.

Then when the tea and honey have cooled sufficiently pitch in the dry yeast, wait until foaming and add to the must. Also, use sufficient (started) yeast since otherwise the yeast is still trying to form to make enough yeast to ferment properly.   Also, don't worry about the tea giving off taste, I do this on approx. 5 L batches and I taste no tea at all through my mead."

mead,3b21xf,gundog48,3,Thu Jun 25 09:49:45 2015 UTC,"I did a hydromel awhile back with Wyeast 1388. Started at 1.062, finished at 0.996. I was much in the same boat - that it wasn't really interesting - so I started messing with adding tannins. Just a little tannin seemed to really help make it more interesting. Maybe that can help you?"
mead,3b21xf,gchucky,3,Thu Jun 25 12:04:13 2015 UTC,"There's two tricks I've tried with a fair bit of success (though YMMV):  The first is to make it a sparkling mead rather than still, which you already seem to be planning anyways. The CO2 just plain makes it more interesting, and that's a good thing when you're dealing with low gravity musts.  The second option is to use a bit of lactose. This will add both sweetness and a bit of complexity to it, without really affecting the flavor profile greatly. You have to be a bit careful with it though, as there IS such a thing as too much. Definitely something to use as a secondary addition, to flavor. There's also lots of people who will say lactose has no place in mead, but they're boring. :)  As for yeast, yeah definitely avoid 1118, I'd say stick with something like S-04 (even US-05 may be a little vigorous)."
mead,3b21xf,Krinberry,3,Thu Jun 25 17:32:08 2015 UTC,"I've decided to go with US-05 simply because it's on hand, started my starter an hour or two ago, hopefully it'll be okay!  Never done a sparkling mead before but I've been very eager to try. I've always avoided it because I like my meads medium-sweet, my process tends to be to ferment dry and backsweeten so making a sparkling mead has never been an option. I have some lactose but it does seem to require rather a lot to sweeten to any real degree! I have read about bottle pasturisation which could work, but seems to be venturing into the... danger zone."
mead,3b21xf,i_forget_my_userids,2,Thu Jun 25 18:06:00 2015 UTC,"Add some apple pie spice. It'll function much the same way as grape tannin, but it'll also add complementary flavors to the apple and honey."
mead,3b21xf,Gyges_of_Lydia,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:41:12 2015 UTC,"I've done a few batches of hydromel recently and had the same kind of issue.  I found that adding tannins/acidity and carbonating it really brought out the flavors a lot more. It's still going to have a light body, but my last batch is more like a cider than just water now.  Also, i really like how my bochet hydromel turned out (and it's not even done ageing yet). It didn't have the same watery feel that my traditional one did."
mead,3b21xf,StormBeforeDawn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:37:23 2015 UTC,"A botchet hydromel sounds like a fantastic idea! I did a bochet a while ago and it was a bit overpowering with licorice flavours, but I bet in a light bodied mead it would be just perfect! I do normally add a bit of tea for tannins, and I've just started adding citric acid to my sweeter meads which as improved them greatly. I'm hoping that the apple juice in this case will provide tannins and body, but I'm concerned about it totally overpowering the honey."

mead,3b1s5a,Darr_Syn,4,Thu Jun 25 07:25:29 2015 UTC,They should cool with ageing. At least that's the general advice. Sweetening it to conceal the burn might be another option.
mead,3b1s5a,Adderkleet,2,Thu Jun 25 09:01:19 2015 UTC,"the vanilla sounds like it's still actively fermenting, not knowing anything about the recipe, I'd say give it until it's clear before bottling, and ideally you could let it sit for 6 or more months in carboys before bottling...   otherwise, adderkleet is correct, you can cover hot flavors up with acidity or sweetness, but they only 'go away' with time."
mead,3b1s5a,new-Baltimoreon,2,Thu Jun 25 12:19:48 2015 UTC,"For mead, time is the cure. But, if you MUST, I remember seeing someone on here talk about using bentonite (and much more than the recommended dose) to try to get rid of some of the fusels. You could over-sweeten it to hide some of the heat. Oak it a lot to possibly hide some as well. I also heard bottling in a small bottle causes it to mature faster. I'm not 100% sure on any of these, but these are just some of the suggestions I've seen."
mead,3b1s5a,Moonpi314,2,Thu Jun 25 12:58:47 2015 UTC,"Have you considered lowering the fermentation temperature for next time?  The best way to get rid of the ""hot"" flavor is to prevent it from happening.  Otherwise, aging and back sweetening are two of the best options."

Pretty damn good, especially if you can keep fermentation temperatures reasonably low (~65), use staggered nutrient additions, and keep alcohol levels moderate.   I currently reside in a 595 sqft apartment.   I currently brew in less than half of that space. No problem whatsoever.   Is Houston, TX climate/state laws reasonable or unsuitable?    Texas in summer? Yes. I don't suppose you have a basement storage or something?  I ferment in my bathroom, as temperature is relatively stable and not too hot. Is that an option?   What fruits go well with Blackberries?   Raspberries is the obvious one."
mead,3azxvu,cowboys703,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:29:09 2015 UTC,"If I wanted 65 all the time in Houston, I may need to keep my AC on 24/7, but I guess that's doable.

mead,3azxvu,DeathtoPants,2,Wed Jun 24 22:39:35 2015 UTC,They sell insulated bags that you can brew stuff in. Leave your mead in there with a frozen 2 liter and a fan to circulate air and it will probably keep it about 10 degrees cooler than your apartment for 12 to 15 hours

mead,3azxvu,DeathtoPants,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:47:39 2015 UTC,"All the videos I've seen have you change the container the solution is fermenting in every few weeks or single month, so as to clean out sediment.  I'd like my mead to be reasonable in ABV, but 15-20% at most."
mead,3azxvu,DeathtoPants,2,Wed Jun 24 22:50:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, you're thinking of racking. After fermentation, the mead will slowly clear up, with the yeast and other particles settling at the bottom. Racking is done to get the mead away from the layer of lees when it gets too big.   As racking takes place after fermentation is complete and isn't a form of concentration, it doesn't affect ABV. The exception is if you rack and add fruit, as the fruit will ferment as well.  If you're planning on getting ready for this christmas, I'd leave it the primary fermenter for a month, then rack to an aging carboy and leave it until bottling day.  If I were you I'd go for 12-13% ABV or so. Respectable, but mild enough to be good by christmas."
mead,3azxvu,whiteman90909,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:57:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure yet, but I might add blackberries and raspberries at the same time, so I may rack in between the first round and the aging carboy.    Do you order the carboy's special, or are they regular lidded buckets?"
mead,3azxvu,DeathtoPants,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:04:24 2015 UTC,"You can technically use any food-grade, airtight bucket, but fermentation buckets come with pre-drilled airlock hole with rubber seal, so it's more convenient.  This is what you ideally need:   Fermentation bucket Airlock (Auto)Siphon, to transfer between bucket/carboy and bottling. Secondary carboy + bung to age in. Cleaning agent(PBW, VWP, Iodophor, Oxiclean Free, Bleach in a pinch...) Star San, preferably, to quickly sterilize equipment Hydrometer, to measure how strong the mead is and whether it's finished.   There's a probably a local homebrew shop around, talk with them, they'll help you find exactly what you need. Otherwise, the /r/homebrewing sidebar links to several online stores.  Regarding berries, I'd add a small amount of raspberries at the start of fermentation, like ½# per gallon. This will give slightly more dimension to the raspberry flavor, as well as act as nutrient source and pH buffer. When fermentation is complete, add raspberries and blackberries. ½# for mild notes, 1# for strong with the raspberries. I haven't used blackberries myself but it should be reasonably similar.  After 2 weeks on the berries, rack to aging, leaving berries behind.  What amounts are you looking at making? 5 gallons is slightly cheaper per gallons than 1 gallon due to economics of scale, but requires bigger and more expensive fermentors."

mead,3azxvu,FishBulb85,2,Wed Jun 24 23:44:52 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right.  For less that 1.5 gallons, This bucket is more or less ideal.  Secondary gets tricky. Carboys only seem to come in sizes of 1 and 3 gallons, and you want to fill it as high as possible. See, the problem is that oxygen, post fermentation, is evil. This isn't a problem in the fermentor, as fermentation produces a ton of CO2 that purges the oxygen. Afterwards though, there's no CO2 production, so any oxygen introduced to the carboy is allowed to wreck havoc.  You could maybe just age in a different bucket. I'm not sure how well those hold up for several months though, and they have the obvious disadvantage of being opaque, so you can't see it clear up very well. Another option would be to age in a 3 gallon carboy and add a tad more honey to kick fermentation back up, or simply to add the berries in secondary."

mead,3az7pg,Bunsomel,3,Wed Jun 24 19:19:49 2015 UTC,Sulfites do not effectively or permanently stop fermentation. The yeast can recover.  Sorbate doesn't necessarily stop fermentation either. It effectively neuters the yeast and prevents reproduction.  Using the two in conjunction with each other is effective at stopping fermentation.  Just because the wine looks clear doesn't mean suspended yeasts are not present.  Plastic is not recommended for aging.

Don't add yeast, it won't hurt but there's no point in doing so after only a few months.  A word of advice regarding bottling, since this is your first batch I'm sure you're eager to bottle and drink it. Try to be patient and don't bottle until you're satisfied with the clarity, unless you want a little yeast in the bottles (this doesn't really hurt, but doesn't look pretty and might taste slightly bready if there's a lot)"

mead,3auwdn,kabhaq,3,Tue Jun 23 18:26:21 2015 UTC,"I'd like this mead to come out relatively sweet, is that going to work out well for me or do I need to do something to play with the gravity to get those results?   It will ferment dry, but do not worry. You can get some sorbate and sulfite to stabilize, then backsweeten with honey or sugar. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a low gravity mead.    Will I still be able to get decent clarity if I do not have a secondary?   Secondary isn't a necessity, but you might want to do one if you're going to let it clear for more than a month (recommended). The lees can give off-flavors, and if you're going to stabilize and backsweeten, you'll definitely want to clear in a secondary container. You'll still get clarity with time, probably a week or so sooner if you don't do a secondary container.    Once that month is up, should I just go ahead and bottle it?   You can. I usually go longer than that before I consider bottling.    If I bottle it then, do I need to let the mead sit in the bottles for some period of time?   Drink what tastes good to you. The longer you wait, the better it will be. Bulk aging is generally considered better than bottle aging, so age in a large carboy with a solid bung and almost no airspace if you're going to age. You'll want to make sure off-gassing is complete before putting in the solid bung, though. Use the airlock before that point.   That said, with a low gravity mead like yours, you shouldn't have to age terribly long. They're usually optimal sooner."
mead,3auwdn,i_forget_my_userids,2,Tue Jun 23 18:42:36 2015 UTC,"Mead usually ends up dry unless you have a high starting gravity.  I suggest racking to secondary and aging it for a while.  Anything I've made with wine yeast tastes pretty hot for a while, especially if you're adding all of your nutrient when you're pitching.  You don't want it to sit on the yeast for much longer than a month.  This will probably help explain the process better than I can."
mead,3auhsh,dofartshavelumps,3,Tue Jun 23 16:43:21 2015 UTC,"It probably still has more fermenting to do. Your next step should be racking to another container and getting your liquid off your primary lees. Give it time to finish fermenting, off-gas, and clear."
mead,3auhsh,i_forget_my_userids,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"do my readings seem valid?  are you saying I should get it into a new bottle now, and let it finish it's ferment without all the crap in the bottle?"
mead,3auhsh,i_forget_my_userids,2,Tue Jun 23 17:08:43 2015 UTC,"Readings seem okay, and that's exactly what I'm saying.  You're at around 15.5%ABV right now, and EC1118 can hit higher than that easily (regularly 18%, some have hit over 22%). There is still more fermentable sugar available, so it'll likely keep going. Just get off the lees in the next week or so, and let it clear. Make sure to minimize airspace in the new container."
mead,3auhsh,i_forget_my_userids,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:24:57 2015 UTC,minimize headspace? you mean I should add water to the new container? Won't this decrease alcohol content and flavor? Should I add honey / water?
mead,3auhsh,i_forget_my_userids,2,Tue Jun 23 17:30:25 2015 UTC,"It usually doesn't have noticeable impact on flavor. Your alcohol content is already unpalatably high for my tastes, but to answer your question...  Yes, you can add honey water. Ideally, you would want the honey+water you add to be roughly the same gravity as your original must."
mead,3auhsh,Bunsomel,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:35:41 2015 UTC,"adding the honey / water has a potential to restart the ferment correct? and if the yeast is dead and i add it, it will add that sweetness and lower the alcohol % that we both desire?"
mead,3auhsh,Bunsomel,2,Tue Jun 23 18:02:44 2015 UTC,All signs point to you still having active fermentation. Yeast doesn't really die unless you actively kill it; it just goes kind of dormant.
mead,3auhsh,Bunsomel,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:05:51 2015 UTC,"You can add honey IF the mead needs more sweetness, but please do not add water. It doesn't just dilute the alcohol, it totally dilutes the flavor and body. A little headspace is fine, and it will continue to off-gas for weeks/months so there will be some residual CO2 to protect your wine."
mead,3auhsh,Longwaytofall,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:37:03 2015 UTC,"leave it on the fruit for a month, and then rack it to secondary. Don't add sorbate, it's unnecessary for what you are doing and can potentially cause off-flavors over time. You can add K-meta if you want, but that's also unnecessary as EC-1118 probably won't finish out your must completely, so it has already reached it's tolerance. EC-1118 has very little risk of contamination as well due to it's high alcohol tolerance and it's (unconfirmed, but suspected) killer yeast factor.   I tasted it... not too bad, lil wangy, going to need a little sweetening to be more to my delicate palate ;)   give it time before sweetening, if it's 9 days old it's barely finished fermentation yet. If it's already at 1.040, it's probably tastes quite sweet unless it's being masked by alcohol heat, tannins, spices, and other what-nots, so give it a month and try it again when you rack it to secondary. Be patient, let it clear up in secondary, and bottle when it's ready."
mead,3auhsh,zofoandrew,2,Tue Jun 23 17:23:23 2015 UTC,"ok, so let me ask a stupid question... can I leave it on the fruit another 21 days? with no signs of activity? it wont go bad?"
mead,3auhsh,Bunsomel,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:27:18 2015 UTC,"Yep. it won't rot or anything. The alcohol and CO2 will protect it. A good rule of thumb is to leave fruit in for a month, but plenty of people have left fruit in primary/secondary for several months at a time, so no worries."

mead,3aseoj,MarsColonist,2,Tue Jun 23 05:43:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I recall reading about buckwheat honey being pretty unpleasant to ferment.

It's aged to something pretty high in character, but I don't know what would really happen if it had comprised 100% of the honey instead of ~30%.  I'd also note that it created something really interesting when I cut it 50/50 with ""very sweet"" commercial brews like Chaucer's.  That being said, the ""black mead"" idea is interesting - but if you're new to this game, I suggest you do a few practice batches to get the gist of it, and to get a feel for the character you want - before combining all the elements (much like what /u/boogertom suggested already).

mead,3arwaf,TFJesusClaus,3,Tue Jun 23 00:37:55 2015 UTC,"There are a whole host of factors influencing how quickly your ferment will finish up, like nutrients, gravity, temperature, pitch rate, and many others. The only real way to be sure is consecutive hydrometer readings. As we know neither of these it's gard to give you an appropriate answer. Say it was regular beer strength: for beers, 10 days in primary is very common before bottling. The only thing that happens if you leave it longer is that it clears up further."

Once you get to secondary, get some canned pumpkin pie mix (maybe 10 cans or so... I used real pumpkins and made the mix myself last time but you can't get pumpkin this time of year) and put it in a very fine straining bag and throw that in the secondary. Some of it will seep out, but that's ok as long as it's not ALL of it. It's really gross getting globs of pumpkin pie mix out when you do the transfer and this will help with that.   Throw in a bunch of pumpkin pie spice and some ground nutmeg.   Do the rest of the process like you would any other melomel."

mead,3apx5i,koalaphysics,2,Mon Jun 22 21:47:22 2015 UTC,Give or take a few... it depends how much pumpkin flavor you want I suppose.
mead,3apx5i,EndlessSandwich,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:42:30 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, do you do real pumpkin pie filling?  A lot of pumpkin pie filling is not pumpkin at all, but a squash.  You need to look at the can to see what the actual contents are."

mead,3apx5i,Nachotime,2,Tue Jun 23 15:17:38 2015 UTC,I would just go with a standard recipe then rack onto about 4 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. Many breweries get that pumpkin pie flavor without using a single bit of actual pumpkin. The actual flavor of pumpkin is very squash like and not too reminiscent of the flavors people think of when they think of fall.
mead,3apvu9,piperson,3,Mon Jun 22 15:20:50 2015 UTC,"As far as the plums go, in the next batch, leave out the pits and skins next time. That's where a LOT of the bitterness/sourness is coming from, and it is what gives it the medicinal flavor. It also kills the natural fruit flavors in the meat of the plum.    As for what you can do at this point, you MIGHT try finding a few sweeter plums and skinning/pitting them and let them sit in there for a bit, after sterilizing them. May help get some of the fruit flavor into the mead. With plums, I love cloves, and maybe a bit of allspice."
mead,3apvu9,MeadHammer,3,Mon Jun 22 16:46:41 2015 UTC,"Skins are fine for plums, but definitely get rid of the pits. I make a plum country wine that starts with 35lbs of plums, then has 10-15 lbs of sugar added to get the sweetness past attenuation, so I really think you made a plum wine with some honey, rather than a plum mead. Plum is going to be a more significant flavour than honey in this beverage, regardless.   When you say 'medicinal,' please describe in more detail. If you try sweetening a shot class worth with sugar, does i bring out the plumminess and make an adequate dessert wine?"
mead,3apvu9,larkvi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:39:10 2015 UTC,"I may have overstated 'medicinal'. The sourness and the strong alcohol gives it a slightly medicinal taste. I'd like to bring out more fruity notes.   Yeah, if it had more sugar, it would taste more fruity. Actually when it was brewing and had more sugar, it reminded me of pink lemonade."
mead,3apvu9,MeadHammer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:22:50 2015 UTC,Thanks. That sounds good. Is this from experience? Have you made plum mead before?  I left the skins and pits in because that's the way they make red wine. It gives the wine color and tannin. But plums are way less intense and sweet as grapes are and so makes a weaker brew.
mead,3apvu9,larkvi,4,Mon Jun 22 16:56:12 2015 UTC,"I've done plums before, but have more experience with pears. Incidentally, you treat them both very similarly. Both are very delicate fruits with delicate flavors. The pits of most stone fruits contain a number of bitter chemicals within them that can leach out during immersion, so definitely leave the pits out. That's probably where you are getting a lot of your sourness from.   It might be a weird way to do things, but when deciding what parts to put in a mead, I usually break them down into separate components. (skin, flesh, seeds, etc) and chew them to see what flavors come out of them. Sometimes, you want the bitterness etc that most fruit skins have. Other times you don't. I don't recommend putting seeds in. Alternatively, you can basically make a tea out of the components by steeping them in boiling water, and see what flavors come out. This also allows for you to work on flavor profiles before you spend a lot of money making mead."
mead,3apvu9,MeadHammer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:24:44 2015 UTC,Great advice. Thanks.  Do you use herbs or spices in your meads? The clove I put had little if any taste. I was told to be causious so I used just one. I would probably use 3 next time. What is your experience?
mead,3ao2j8,Davis_a_smith,2,Mon Jun 22 02:33:49 2015 UTC,LOL. I find that lees (the little shitters which make the inclarity) do change the smell and taste (slightly)... But a lot of the people who drink my mead (AKA quite a few friends and family) don't notice that change... so I let it slide...
mead,3ap635,Barrebaron,3,Mon Jun 22 11:00:58 2015 UTC,Not really in a negative way. You may lose some of the flavor and aroma from using pasteurized honey but it should still taste great.  Most honey from the store has been heated up and filtered. Even raw honey that we get off a farm gets warmed up a bit four easier transfer to buckets.

mead,3ao30l,Loki_Sunday,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:55:59 2015 UTC,Mead is very forgiving. I'd go ahead and rack it into a secondary. Primary ferment is probably done and that's why it has slowed down or  stopped. As for this film a picture would help  out a lot .

mead,3antuo,i_forget_my_userids,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:38:15 2015 UTC,"Among my friends and family, all of whom like my mead and want me to keep doing it, there are two lines of thought. For some of them, they really want me to recreate old recipes, stay classic. Their thought is that mead is an older drink and should remain the same. Classic recipes are classic for a reason.  The other line of thought is thatm although mead has this great history and a lot of great 'tried and true' recipes, it is such a versatile drink that we can do just about anything with it, so why not bring mead into the modern era with cool flavors and unique looks? Change the image of mead from some old fashion idea to a live and, well, awesome beverage.   I try to satisfy both of these by switching back and forth. I just finished and bottled a cream soda mead, and I will be doing an oaked mead here coming up (cream soda being the new fangled mead and the oaked being classical). In the new-fangled mead category, I have definitely played with flavors, but never colors, so I was thinking, why not make a mead with many colors? It seemed possible, and I think if I play with it right, I could make a trippy 'hip' mead which will push the envelope just that little bit farther."
mead,3antuo,zofoandrew,2,Tue Jun 23 00:26:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, guess i'm more of a traditionalist. Mostly care about taste but aesthetics is part of that I reckon. I don't think getting swirling ""trippy"" colors is a good idea with anything. Doubt there's many people tripping on acid who want to see a lava lamp in the mead they're drinking. Just my 2 cents .

mead,3am09r,smp501,3,Sun Jun 21 15:18:33 2015 UTC,"Looking around, it seems most recipes have the cherry content clocked at a 1lb/Gal.  Huh, I was going to use the mead calculator on the sidebar to figure the exchange rate for lb-juice...  But it seems to be broken.  Soooo, let's go on over to produce converter where we learn that 1 lb of cherries = 12oz of juice.  This tells me that your juice (64oz) is enough to make just over five gallons of cherry-flavored mead.  In otherwords, 64oz in one gallon... would give you cough syrup.  That being said, this is speculation based on information from several sources excluding my own personal experience (which is zip with cherry).  My advice is to do 16oz in a Gal (as you stated you wanted it strong in cherry) and save the rest of the juice for another batch down the road."
mead,3am09r,a_Mazing_Nurse,2,Sun Jun 21 15:57:50 2015 UTC,"I did .5 gal in primary .5 gal after ferment. It was cough syrup for a few months, but after 6 it was one of my best meads. 5 gal batch. I would start under 10 to 1 juice to total volume and see what you like."

mead,3am09r,new-Baltimoreon,2,Sun Jun 21 17:24:26 2015 UTC,"my cherry melomel was pretty good and dead simple (from memory): 3 liters of Tart cherry Juice (sounds like your find almost exactly), and 3lbs of clover honey in a glass jug, 71B & yeast nutrition according to directions. OG of ~1.134, FG ~1.020, ABV 14.5%  the residual sweetness is enough to balance the tartness of the cherries without being too sweet, and even has notes of dark chocolate (even though I never added any)."
mead,3am09r,ostensibly001,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:25:59 2015 UTC,"I used 23lbs of fruit (276 oz) in in 8 gallons of must for primary and another 10lbs (120 oz) in secondary. tasted good from very early - no cough syrup flavor, probably b/c the fruit was over 90% tart cherries."
mead,3am09r,new-Baltimoreon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:33:32 2015 UTC,next time I have 33 lbs of cherries I will give your recipe a shot...  how much honey and what yeast did you use?
mead,3am09r,ostensibly001,2,Mon Jun 22 12:15:59 2015 UTC,"It was 21lbs OB, 3lbs buckwheat, 10g RC-212, 31 lbs montmorency and 2lb black cherries. I used .4g of Rapidase Maxi-fruit for extra color retention. Had it on a quart of frozen pits for a month in secondary, I wasn't really sure what to expect and I can't tell if it made a difference.  Ok, maybe that's not over 90% after all."
mead,3ajtdq,Genoms,6,Sat Jun 20 22:08:20 2015 UTC,"From the photos, that looks like honey, rather than a clear layer.  Most mazers here like to mix their honey into their must until it's dissolved, but you don't have to.  I even seem to recall reading a post on the benefits of having the honey in a layer at the bottom.  Either way, if you've got airlock activity, you've got CO2. If you have CO2, you've got fermentation. If you have fermentation, you're getting alcohol!  So, I don't think you have anything to worry about/there is anything you need to do. But, seeing as this is primary and before the first 1/3 sugar break, your mead will benefit from aeration, if you want to swoosh (it's a technical term) it around. This will also allow your honey to go into suspension.  Now, where did that mouse go with my cookie?  EDIT: Did some digging here, and here. Couldn't find the benefits of not stirring... This bothers me.  EDIT 2: I must be imagining things, no article on the benefits of not stirring found."
mead,3ajtdq,a_Mazing_Nurse,4,Sat Jun 20 22:14:26 2015 UTC,"I recall this discussion (but have no links at hand).  I think the benefit is supposedly like a step feeding.  If it isn't dissolved then the OG is lower and yeast can get started and use up all the honey, whereas if it's all dissolved then the OG may be too much for the yeast in question to start.  Yeast not only have an alcohol limit on the back end, they have specific gravity limitations on the front end.  Tl;dr: a yeast may be able to ferment x pounds of honey/sugar, but that doesn't mean they can get started if x pounds is dissolved in the must from the beginning."
mead,3ajtdq,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:05:16 2015 UTC,"That is a load off my mind. I guess saying it is a clear layer wasn't the right thing to say. Being my first time I didn't know how much stirring I would need to do for the honey to dissolve completely. I do remember thinking the must looked to watery and didn't check the bottom for settling.  The idea of a staged feeding sound reasonable and beneficial, so I think I will keep it as it is. Well, unless it stays on the bottom well into the second week and the yeast doesn't seem to be getting at the honey."
mead,3ajtdq,_ilovetofu_,2,Sat Jun 20 23:49:46 2015 UTC,"The level should drop significantly. I am often forgetful and do not heat the base before adding it and once fermentation starts, the level drops rather quickly. It's pretty interesting."
mead,3ajtdq,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,2,Sun Jun 21 00:13:58 2015 UTC,"I am taking a photo a day until I have bottled it, so there will be a fun slideshow when it is all over."
mead,3ajtdq,_ilovetofu_,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:57:51 2015 UTC,"In general you should dissolve it all so you can get an accurate specific gravity reading and therefore determine your alcohol % when it's done. Most people who use carboys use something like this stirrer or a thing called a wine whip.   edit: you can always dissolve it in water before putting it in the carboy of course, but these tools are handy for aerating and degassing as well."
mead,3ajtdq,JonasTorgersen,2,Sun Jun 21 11:01:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely honey, you don't have to stir. I've done it both ways and it will get used up, maybe a little slower."

mead,3ahxoo,Reziik,5,Sat Jun 20 10:01:33 2015 UTC,start with 3lbs/gal and add that last 1lb/gal near the end of fermentation. Dont start with 4lb/gal as itt will have a difficult time taking off.
mead,3ahxoo,MarsColonist,2,Sat Jun 20 14:29:10 2015 UTC,So much this. I start with 3lb/g and always use ec1118 for my sweet mead.

mead,3ahxoo,MarsColonist,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:36:14 2015 UTC,Yeah. Still the same. Too much sugar upfront will overwhelm the yeast.
mead,3ahxoo,i_forget_my_userids,3,Sun Jun 21 17:27:21 2015 UTC,Why would the bottles blow up? Don't bottle until fermentation is complete. Another alternative is to add another half pound of honey to your recipe.
mead,3ahxoo,i_forget_my_userids,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:14:55 2015 UTC,alright so an extra half pound per gal would keep it sweet over 18% apv? i have no idea how to work those calculators on the side.   i was told they might pop the top or burst if back sweetened and bottled because fermentation restarts.
mead,3ahxoo,madwilliamflint,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:27:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah if you backsweeten without stabilizers, it can blow bottles. If you max out the yeast's alcohol tolerance, it can't ferment further, leaving all the residual sugar to linger. EC1118 is a monster, though.   4.5lbs honey in 1 gallon total volume has 20.xx% alcohol potential. For the 3 gallon batch you'll need 13.5lbs."
mead,3ahxoo,mackgeofries,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:41:14 2015 UTC,yeah. I had some world class bombs with a batch of hard lemonade I made.  Backsweetened it but wasn't paying attention and put the grolsch bottles in the fridge.  Blew apart the inside of the fridge.  It was pretty theatrical.
mead,3ahxoo,thalience,2,Sun Jun 21 23:09:27 2015 UTC,"Make sure you get a hydrometer as well. They have some that as your making it, when you take an initial reading it'll show (an estimated) range for dry, mid, sweet, and dessert wines/meads. You'll need to go on the high end or above for 1118, but should help.  For the future, you can get d47 and 71b off of amazon as well."

mead,3ahxoo,1WANTtohatereddit,2,Sun Jun 21 13:39:22 2015 UTC,"im wondering if i don't add much nutrient for the yeast will that counteract things a bit and cause the yeast to stop earlier than 18% leaving the meed sweeter?   It will certainly increase the chances of your yeast stalling out early, but not by any reliable percentage. Depending on a variety of hard-to-predict factors, you could see anything between failing to start at all and powering through to 18% (or more).  Not recommended as a strategy."
mead,3ahxoo,themadmasher,2,Sat Jun 20 15:50:08 2015 UTC,"You are welcome to do what you like, but the higher the alcohol the hotter it will taste for longer.  A beginner would do best to shoot for 11 percent with another yeast or use 1118 but only do around 2 lbs honey, let it ferment completely, stabilize, then back sweeten.  Use the calculator on the side bar to figure out how much honey to add to 3gals to make 11 percent.  Will this be a traditional?"
mead,3ahxoo,FrankiePoops,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:56:33 2015 UTC,im not sure what traditional entails but i'm entirely lost as to how to use those calculators. i will be shooting for a lower % with a diffrent yeast after all thankfully.
mead,3ahxoo,Alcoholic_Autonomous,2,Sun Jun 21 13:42:27 2015 UTC,I use 1118 almost exclusively and love it.  I have used nutrient and sometimes I skip it.  Most of my beauties top out around 14%-16%.  If you find it necessary to backsweeten then  you can either cold crash it and rack to another vessel or leave it in your fermentation vessel until fermentation stops.
mead,3aig37,mackgeofries,2,Sat Jun 20 14:25:20 2015 UTC,"Learn your state's laws first. In my state it is illegal to sell home-fermented foodstuffs without a permit.

TSP (available at the hardware store) is a little weaker, shouldn't damage the glass as fast.  An acid is probably a good choice too, starsan is 50% phosphoric acid. Might want to try straight starsan on that, pour an ounce in there and flip it over so the starsan soaks on that spot.  Just be careful with these methods, strong acids or bases work just as well on you as they do on dirt, and all the ones I listed will go through the glass if you leave them on too long or let them get too hot.

It's not cheap, and you use a lot of it like a ?cup? for 5 gallons of water.  It's kinda like industrial strength oxiclean.  EDIT:  DO NOT USE WITH ANYTHING ENABLED!  Not sure if it is on the label or not, but left a standard bowl halfway in the stuff over night.  Now I have a bowl that is half enabled.  So if you have an enabled sink, be sure to give it a good rinse right after."

mead,3agotq,captainwacky91,2,Sat Jun 20 01:06:24 2015 UTC,"Currently, I am making a fig mead.   Let me tell you how fortunate you are to have a friend with a fig tree.   From my understanding, figs aren't very hardy. Living in Ohio, I have only found one reliable source for figs, and that one reliable source only carries one varietal (black mission). I paid out the nose for them, too. A pre-packaged 12 oz container of fresh figs cost me $5-$6. I think the only other safe bet (that isn't Dorothy Lane Market) would be Jungle Jim's.... all the way in fucking Cincinnati.   That being said, I have a one gallon set up working; with 1 pound of black mission figs and a fistful of raisins in the primary (with three pounds of honey), looking to oak in secondary.   I am also looking into a possible filtering solution for my racking cane, as those fig seeds are absolutely tiny and I can easily imagine them going along for the ride when I transfer from one container to another. Might be something you might want to be aware of, as well."

mead,3ag9rx,octopusghost,3,Fri Jun 19 22:15:17 2015 UTC,"71B is a good yeast to use, and it won't ferment as hot or dry. Other than that, I'd say use real Ceylon cinnamon or Saigon cinnamon. Most of the cinnamon sticks you see are Cassia."

I live in an area where there are lots of options for good local honey (Portland, Oregon). Are there any types of honey (such as maybe apple blossom) that would be better for this sort of mead than others?"
mead,3ag9rx,i_forget_my_userids,2,Fri Jun 19 22:32:44 2015 UTC,Any light flavored varietal will be fine. Probably just do wildflower. You don't want anything that'll clash or drown out the apple.

I usually ferment until it should be dead, no more activity, then add the yeast killer to be sure.  I'd recommend adding ""enough"" honey in the beginning so you don't have to worry about adding in too much or not enough at the end.

mead,3aeq6h,Chevey0,7,Fri Jun 19 15:00:03 2015 UTC,Coconut water in mead making is awful.  We have 6 years and 3 Mazer Cups under our belts.  Got the wild idea that coconut water would make a GREAT mead.  Ended up tasting like what I would imagine sweaty balls kept in a wet Speedo would taste like.  Never aged out.  It is the only batch we couldn't save and sacrificed to the drain god.  Use flaked coconut in secondary.
mead,3aeq6h,1WANTtohatereddit,3,Fri Jun 19 15:52:49 2015 UTC,tasting like what I would imagine sweaty balls kept in a wet Speedo would taste like   hahaha eww.... might have to make a small batch just to give to people I don't want to share with...

mead,3aeq6h,a_Mazing_Nurse,2,Sun Jun 21 12:56:13 2015 UTC,"May I ask what you did with the coconut water so that I may potentially avoid the same mistake?  Did you add it in primary, secondary? Did you stabilized prior to the addition in secondary? How long did you age the fucker?"
mead,3aeq6h,1WANTtohatereddit,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:00:05 2015 UTC,"1 gallon batch (thank goodness that was all).  3 qts coconut water/3 lbs honey.  Ferment 2 weeks.  Rack and settle 2 weeks.  Tasted (oh, god that isn't good, maybe it will age out) and bottle.  It was 12%.  Cracked one open @ 4 months-nope.  Tasted exactly the same.  Rinse and repeat at 6 mos. 1year.  It did not change flavor for an entire year.  Poured out the last 3 bottles.  There was no coconut flavor at all.  Sort of electrolyte/salt flavor.  After asking around of other experienced brewers, none of them wanted to even try it.  Since it's fairly expensive and you get so little (to no) flavor, I can't see a reason to revisit it."
mead,3aeq6h,a_Mazing_Nurse,2,Sun Jun 21 13:58:17 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking that, since it was added in primary, the sugars in the coconut water were fermented, leaving behind all the other flavors.  Kinda like when you get a honey that you really love, make a traditional, and are disappointed because it doesn't have the taste you wanted (looking at you, buckwheat honey).  So, I'm thinking I'll brew up to 14% then dilute it down to 10-12% with coconut water. If I don't get the taste I want, I'll dilute it further.  Thanks for sharing your experience, /u/1WANTtohatereddit"
mead,3aeq6h,1WANTtohatereddit,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:31:45 2015 UTC,Let me know how it turns out.  I love coconut water and would love to find a reason to use it again.
mead,3aeq6h,DeathtoPants,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:36:44 2015 UTC,What do you think about adding it to the mead after the yeast is out of the equation?
mead,3aeq6h,1WANTtohatereddit,2,Fri Jun 19 15:55:26 2015 UTC,"Just say no.  There really isn't much coconut favor in coconut water, anyway.  I love it for the electrolytes."
mead,3aeq6h,DeathtoPants,2,Fri Jun 19 16:16:53 2015 UTC,"Mango and passion fruit will probably go down great. I'd put at most half of each into primary and add the rest in secondary. Not sure about coconut milk though.  I'd personally go for 2.5 pounds of honey to get a slightly lighter mead with this kind of fruit.  For yeast, Lalvin 71B is a great bet."
mead,3aeq6h,DeathtoPants,2,Fri Jun 19 15:12:55 2015 UTC,so 1lb of each in primary then 1lb of each in secondary.   There is a difference between coconut water and coconut milk. The water is from younger coconuts and doesnt have any of the coconut oil that the milk has.  http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/coconut-milk-or-coconut-water-whats-the-difference  Im still new to brewing but i dont think there is anything in CWater that would mess up the fermentation.
mead,3aeq6h,DeathtoPants,4,Fri Jun 19 15:27:25 2015 UTC,"You're right about the coconut water.  I don't think there's any issue fermenting coconut water either, I'm mostly concerned about how it would taste and how it would play along with the fruit. An option would be adding coconut water post-fermentation to the mead until you get a balance you like."
mead,3aeq6h,DeathtoPants,2,Fri Jun 19 15:35:00 2015 UTC,"i bloody love coconut water, if i could afford it i would supplement all the water with coconut water and just ferment that"

Then how long should i leave it for before bottling it? Its how long at each stage im not sure on"
mead,3aeq6h,Bunsomel,2,Fri Jun 19 15:47:06 2015 UTC,"There are 2 ways to go about secondary additions. Either you put the fruit in a second bucket(preferable to carboys because fruit can be a PITA to get out), or you remove the old fruit and add the new fruit in directly.  Taste it after a week, if you're satisfied with the amount of fruit flavor, rack to an aging carboy. If not, wait another week or two.  Leave it in the aging carboy for as long as you can stand waiting, but at least long enough to be reasonably clear (you don't have to, but Future You will thank you)."
mead,3afo2m,ifistbadgers,3,Fri Jun 19 19:22:41 2015 UTC,"You could use chocolate extract or a cacao nibs tincture. For the tincture, you get some cacao nibs, soak them in vodka for 1-2 weeks, then toss the whole thing into your fermenter. Neither of these options will mess with your clarity."
mead,3afo2m,SqueakyCheeseCurds,2,Fri Jun 19 21:25:48 2015 UTC,"Oh man, well I'm pretty sure Nesquik is mostly sugar with cocoa as a secondary ingredient, followed by stabilizers, emulsifiers, and preservatives. It's going to dissolve better, but it'll kick start fermentation again if you haven't stabilized and bump up sweetness a lot of you have stabilized. I'm also concerned it might mess up clarity.   This doesn't sound like a great idea to me, but what do I know. I'd rather just use cocoa powder and deal with low solubility some other way. I have no experience either way, but I'm curious what others have to say."

mead,3adx0n,i_forget_my_userids,2,Fri Jun 19 12:26:43 2015 UTC,"Could mean you read the gravity wrong, or it could mean you'll have a lot of residual sweetness. 71B only goes to like 14%, so your gravity would finish in the 1.09 ballpark. The sugar content of your finished product will be like 21%. If there is any airspace in your fermentation container after primary fermentation finishes, fill it with water; just make sure there's a little space between the water level and the bottom of your airlock.   I'd like to see your recipe before I commit to this response, if you have one."

mead,3adx0n,mackgeofries,2,Fri Jun 19 12:44:20 2015 UTC,"Actual gravity should be around 1.113 and should finish much nicer at around the 14% alcohol tolerance of your yeast, with almost no residual sweetness. I'm less worried now. It should be nice. http://i.imgur.com/9mt1d2A.jpg"
mead,3ac9em,TheGuyWithTheSwords,6,Thu Jun 18 22:50:11 2015 UTC,"Not enough headspace + fruit pieces capable of clogging holes + active fermentation = mess like you currently have on your hands.   To prevent in future, leave more headspace, especially when using fruits like blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, etc. that are notorious for blowouts.

mead,3ac9em,Bunsomel,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:05:46 2015 UTC,"to tack on to what he said, when you're using that much fruit you have to do punchdowns - sometimes several times a day - until fermentation dies down.

mead,3ac9em,MeadHammer,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:08:35 2015 UTC,"This is actually the reason why I usually wait and add fruit in secondary instead of primary.

mead,3ac6fc,DeathtoPants,2,Thu Jun 18 23:00:04 2015 UTC,There's no way to remove the yeast without getting a ton of oxidation at this point. You're better off leaving the bottom yeast behind when pouring. Remember to store it upright to make the yeast drop to the bottom.

mead,3aae1p,Bunsomel,3,Thu Jun 18 14:26:01 2015 UTC,"It can be stupid hard to stop an active fermentation in my experience.  K-meta is extremely effective, however, when fermentation has stopped.  So what you need to do, probably, is bring the carboys down to 35F and hold them there for 2-3 days, then rack onto 1 gram per 5 gallons of potassium metabisulfite. I generally:   Pull a hydrometer of mead (1/4th cup-ish), take measurements as usual. Pour into sanitized measuring cup. Add k-meta, stir well. Add to empty sanitized carboy. Rack the rest of the mead onto that.   If you're having issues, I'd probably put it back in the fridge another couple of days just to be sure nothing wakes back up.  Lacking a way to cool it, I don't know of a better way than time.  I wouldn't add more sorbate at this point.  Edit: Refer to the information /u/MyOtherBrotherDarryl posted to determine how much to add. A tablet is theoretically .44 grams of k-meta. Most of my meads end up using only 1 gram per 5 gallons (I use it powdered because I have a decent gram scale), which comes out to about 30 ppm in addition to whatever free SO2 occurs naturally. Pretty decent range for a finished mead - most of the time."
mead,3aae1p,balathustrius,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:23:03 2015 UTC,"I think that's going to be my plan of action. Put the meads down to freezing temps for a week and rack onto a tiny bit more sulfite, then put them back in the freezer. Take them out and keep an eye on the gravity for a few weeks before bottling."
mead,3aae1p,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,2,Thu Jun 18 15:26:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's a pH issue?  Kmeta dosage / efficacy is reportedly affected by pH.

mead,3aae1p,curgoth,2,Thu Jun 18 15:10:26 2015 UTC,"I think you may have added too little kmeta. The rule of thumb is one campden tablet per gallon, and if I recall correctly, that's 1/8 tsp per gallon.  You should add the sorbate at the same time as the kmeta to prevent it kicking out geraniols.  Lastly, if your evidence of fermentation is bubbling, some of it could be degassing rather than fermentation."

The yeast that are still viable will continue fermenting until they die-off on their own. Normally yeast aren't able to continue too far without some backup from new cells, but that's not always the case. The only way you can truly kill-off the yeast to stop fermentation is to pasteurize."

What you said is correct and EC-1118 will go to 20% with some TLC, but you might end up with a mead that finishes sweet if you attempt it. And maybe that's what you want. It should have no trouble hitting 17% under non-ideal circumstances, though.  A too-high hydrometer reading can result from lots of issues. I'd stick with the estimate unless you suspect your honey weight measurement was off for some reason."
mead,3ab2nf,i_forget_my_userids,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:07:16 2015 UTC,"the only reason I was concerned is because this honey is weird, it's unprocessed creamy honey, this is my first attempt at hooch, and the first time I have used this weird Germany honey, it tastes real good, but I am used to the junk in the bear from the US so I dont know if this has more / less / or the same sugar as that pedestrian stuff.  The hydrometer was almost all the way out of the water at the initial reading, and it was reading like 20%, there is no way that could be correct, that is why i question it.  when you say sweet... like how sweet, like candy, kool aid, wine coolers? :)  I dont like real dry, I would like to get a nice balance, that would be around the 16% range im guessing?"
mead,3ab2nf,DeathtoPants,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:15:00 2015 UTC,"it's unprocessed creamy honey   Chemically, it's still made of the same stuff. It's just been allowed to crystallize and been whipped. As long as you're measuring by weight, it works just as you'd expect.   The hydrometer was almost all the way out of the water at the initial reading, and it was reading like 20%, there is no way that could be correct, that is why i question it.   Could have been high pulp content?   when you say sweet... like how sweet   Hard to say with EC-1118. The stuff is a monster, but I've also known it to peter out around 17%. Assuming you give it 20% potential alcohol, and assuming it ferments exactly to 18%, you'd finish around 1.018, which is roughly medium sweet. It's probably a very inoffensive level of sweetness no matter how you like your wine.  Perceived sweetness is just that, however, perceived. You would have to experiment with sweetness levels to see what you like, and how other ingredients affect the perceived sweetness level."
mead,3ab2nf,DeathtoPants,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:39:34 2015 UTC,"I would have thought pulp, but I didnt mash the apricots, i just threw them in there, so when i stole some of the mead it was just honey / water that was measured.  is the ec-1118 the yeast of choice for mead?

mead,3ab2nf,DeathtoPants,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:45:33 2015 UTC,That would explain the higher gravity measurement you made. The apricots also have a lot of water in them.

Its just not possible to scrub all the microbes off. You'll always be introducing something foreign. However, to your point, it actually doesn't make a difference in winemaking.  This is because, if you are following the general rules, you're using selective pressures to protect against a runaway infection (osmotic, anaerobic, pH conditions, etc.).   Microbes have all sorts of mechanisms for surviving a wash or scrubbing, like spores, biofilms, matrix formation, etc., which are very effective on the surface of fruit, wood, vegetative matter, etc. because its imperfect and porous. Glass and metal are a different story.  This is why you can stomp grapes to make wine. The same principles apply. There's just too much acid and sugar for anything to go wrong."

mead,3a87t1,ReduceSanity,6,Thu Jun 18 00:14:44 2015 UTC,"You started one week ago and you already racked to secondary? That's...unnecessary. Fermentation is still active, yeast is still suspended, and you inevitably lose volume each time you rack. There's no point in racking to secondary until the three week point at a minimum.

mead,3a87t1,bailtail,3,Thu Jun 18 04:11:10 2015 UTC,"What was your batch size? 1.02 in one week with 71B is unreasonably quick if starting with a standard must (~1.100-ish). One week would make sense if you had a lower-gravity must, but 71B would have brought that below 1.000 if that was the case. Something seems off.   Regardless, there is absolutely no risk in waiting until the 1-month mark to rack. You'd have to leave it sit on lees for multiple months before you're at risk of developing off flavors. Even then it's far from a given. Not only is it not a bad thing to wait a month, it's often beneficial as it can prolong the conditioning phase which can reduce aging requirements. There are literally no benefits that I can think of to racking before one month, whereas there are potential drawbacks. Just something to keep in mind for your next batch."

EC1118 is vigorous, so it could be dry by now. Sometimes the stars align, and your product ferments or clears more quickly.  Do not rush bottling. You will not hurt anything by letting it sit longer in secondary. If you think it is clear now, rack it to another container and let it sit longer.

My first thought is to grind the fruit loops into a fine-ish powder and add different amounts in. This will allow you to get decent gravity estimates, but then you don't know what you'll get as far as flavor goes, so you could try higher/lower fruit loops powder/honey ratios in different batches.  Or maybe after fermenting on ground up fruit loops you could dry-hop some fruit loops in it? Beware of the sugary coating though - it may throw off your desired gravity, so maybe a rinse would be in order. This makes me want to make a lucky charms mead... so I can eat the life-changing marshmallows that would result.  [EDIT:] A thought occurs... maybe you could just ferment out a dry traditional, stabilize it, and then add crushed fruit loops!

mead,3a8qmm,tubluu,3,Thu Jun 18 03:01:32 2015 UTC,That's fucking expensive. Search for Dutch Gold.
mead,3a8qmm,i_forget_my_userids,3,Thu Jun 18 03:05:18 2015 UTC,"Okay... since you're local-ish to me, kinda sorta (Wilmington).  I don't know the quantity you're looking to purchase but if you ever make it up to the lakes region in NH just a touch further north up in Littleton NH you can buy a 5-gallon bucket of honey for $2.21/lb. It's the same company as Dutch Gold but they're still fairly independent (McLures). The benefit of that is you save on shipping and get honey fairly cheap.  If you want more local I used to buy my honey from Carlisle Honey in Tyngsboro for $3.00-3.50/lb.  Getting the price I listed above, and the sheer quantity I buy (240lbs. several times a year), the cost saving is worth the short drive for me."

mead,3a6kfp,Looseclothes,3,Wed Jun 17 16:59:51 2015 UTC,I've seen recipes that use as much as 17 lbs of strawberries.  I'm avoiding them as its my first year of meadin'.  This will help http://www.bjcp.org/mead/melomel.pdf
mead,3a6kfp,zofoandrew,2,Wed Jun 17 17:50:41 2015 UTC,Strawberries just lose almost all of their flavor. Blueberry turns out well.
mead,3a6kfp,i_forget_my_userids,2,Wed Jun 17 17:20:22 2015 UTC,"Both strawberries and blueberries are regarded as difficult in mead, but not because they ferment poorly or anything like that. It's because those berries' flavors are rather ethereal compared to other fruits, so 5 lbs of blueberries in mead will likely not taste as prominent as 5 lbs of raspberries. For strawberries and blueberries, you would do well to use a lot of fruit, no less than 1.5 lbs per gallon. For reference, I used 16 lbs of strawberries in a 5 gallon batch once, and while the fruit is definitely apparent in the taste, it's still not as strong as I had hoped it would have been, and the banana flavor from only 8 lbs of bananas is still the dominant fruit flavor of that mead.  So if you want a killer strawberry/blueberry mead, consider using a ton of fruit. Freezing and thawing the fruit will help extraction as well. Also, some mazers like to add fruit in both primary and secondary for greater fruit flavor, while some other mazers opt only to add fruit in secondary. The logic behind that being the fruit's flavors are driven off and/or changed by active fermentation, and are more well preserved when added later. Personally, I like using all the fruit up front, as I believe it helps the yeast out, and my meads can start clearing right out of primary. YMMV"
mead,3a6kfp,Bunsomel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:59:19 2015 UTC,"I used ~4 lbs/gal of strawberries and while it has a strawberry flavor, I expected it to be stronger. Finished very dry.  Raspberries are awesome, only needed 1.5 lbs/gallon, and that flavor really came through."
mead,3a6xhj,dofartshavelumps,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:31:05 2015 UTC,"After making strawberry wine twice, I'll never do it again. Strawberries lose almost all their flavor. Make jam, jelly, or some other edible."
mead,3a6xhj,i_forget_my_userids,2,Wed Jun 17 18:42:38 2015 UTC,I have a strawberry melomel that is almost 8 months old now. I tried a bottle last month and it still had a wonderfull strawb aroma/flavor.
mead,3a6xhj,Dirtbag_Actual,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:25:59 2015 UTC,You gotta load way up on 'em.
mead,3a6xhj,balathustrius,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:58:36 2015 UTC,"Do I add more water / honey to it to fill the bottle up for secondary fermentation?   Honey - yes, water - no. Don't just add honey until the container is full though, add it so you get your brew to the right sweetness. You will never end a batch with the same amount of mead as you started with in your must, there will always be volume loss.   When do I being secondary, do I remove the fruit after a week, 2... ?   I usually give anything with fruit a month, but generally you can rack to secondary as soon as primary fermentation slows down or comes to a stop.    It's strawberry season here in Germany and I picked up several pounds for about a dollar / lb, would it be worth making melomel out of it, wine, or strawberry shortcake?       do it all ;)   anyone have any experience with this kind of honey   If it's raw and local, chances are it will make good mead. Likely better than the plastic honey bears."
mead,3a6xhj,Bunsomel,2,Wed Jun 17 18:47:09 2015 UTC,"thank you for your reply, leaving the fruit in a month sounds pretty gross, but I get it, rotting this stuff is how we make the good stuff.  so basically i just leave it in there until it quits bubbling, then i rack into secondary?"
mead,3a6xhj,zofoandrew,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:17:38 2015 UTC,"Its not gross, the alcohol protects it from spoilage organisms as long as you don't let the fruit cap dry out"
mead,3a6xhj,Bunsomel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:47:44 2015 UTC,"The CO2 produced by the yeast protects the fruit from oxygen, so it won't rot. It's fermenting, not spoiling; some breweries have left beer or wine on fruit for months, if not years, at a time.   so basically i just leave it in there until it quits bubbling, then i rack into secondary?   Yep! that will work. In melomels I always primary for a month on fruit and try not to go past 6 weeks, but for nearly everything else I usually just leave it in primary until it starts to clear up, ~2-4 months on avg."
mead,3a5fjt,x888x,6,Wed Jun 17 11:05:51 2015 UTC,"Well, keep in mind that JAOM is designed to be foolproof and drinkable after only 2 months. I thought most of my meads were turning out terrible as well at first, only to find that they become so much better with age.   My very first mead was a disaster when I bottled. It was a hot, cloying, and cloudy mess that nobody wanted to drink, but now that it's over a year old there is no more hotness, no more yeasty flavors, and the fruit and honey come through so beautifully that I've grown to love it. I only have a few bottles left, and now I'm desperately trying to save them for special occasions.   That's not to say though that I have never made a dumper. I sure as shit have, but that comes with learning. I made a capsicumel with earthy, fruity peppers trying to go for something that tasted fruity, but had no fruit. god-fucking-awful. I still keep it around, desperately hoping that it will turn some magical corner, but it has been by far the worst mead I put together.   But after each brew I learn a little bit more. I've learned a lot about 71B and how it works in my musts. I've learned that I like melomels with absurd amounts of fruit. I've learned that my temperatures and nutrients can affect how healthy the fermentation is. And with each subsequent batch I feel that my meads are getting better.  Oddly enough, with each batch my meads have grown more simple. I started off with brazen ideas to create a pumpkin pie mead, with 18 different ingredients and unconventional processes, or lemon-tea mead with 6 different herbs and spices plus real ginger and lemons (came out like floor cleaner). Now my meads have taken on a more simplistic approach - and they have gotten better for it. One of my best was straight blackcurrant juice + honey; it's so simple, and people love it! I have one going right now that is only pineapple juice + honey, and it's coming along very well at the moment.  So don't get frustrated. Take a look at your process, and try something new. Be patient, and be rewarded. If all else fails, try following some of the recipes that are well regarded, like curt stock's triple berry melomel, or some of the recipes that several professionals have offered in Ken Schramm's book, the Compleat Meadmaker. If someone else has made great mead at home with simple ingredients, so can you!"
mead,3a5fjt,Bunsomel,3,Wed Jun 17 12:30:49 2015 UTC,"Well, keep in mind that JAOM is designed to be foolproof and drinkable after only 2 months. I thought most of my meads were turning out terrible as well at first, only to find that they become so much better with age.   It wasn't JOAM. It was just more ""natural"" I guess. Full description in the body of the post.  I hear about aging, but my second batch was so hot and awful after 2 months.  I let it sit for another 4 or 6 and it improved but only to the point of being drinkable. Not enjoyable.  And the simplicity thing...  My batches since my originals (one admittedly was a lime-blacktea) have been   Plain mead Plain mead brewed (and seconded) with 2 vanilla beans Plain mead brewed (and seconded) with a pound of raspberries   That's why I'm stumped. How can standard mead with honey, water, Fermax, and DAP taste so horrible?"
mead,3a5fjt,Bunsomel,2,Wed Jun 17 15:03:22 2015 UTC,"it might be the honey you're using, but it probably comes down to recipe. plain mead (honey+water+yeast) is difficult to pull off properly, because you have nothing to hide its flaws. There's no oak, no fruit, no spice that will cover up fermentation problems. Traditional mead made with a mediocre honey will create a mediocre mead, so go back to thinking about the honey you're using. Plain mead with 2 strings of vanilla isn't going to change much either. And mead brewed with a pound of raspberries should turn out fine for a 1 gallon batch...did you do 1 lb in a 5 gallon batch? If so, you simply need to use more fruit."
mead,3a5fjt,Bunsomel,3,Wed Jun 17 16:06:45 2015 UTC,Pound and a half in a one gallon batch. It's good but very sour
mead,3a5fjt,Bunsomel,2,Wed Jun 17 16:18:47 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like your raspberries' tartness may be overpowering the mead, or perhaps the mead is still young. If it is over three months old and it's still far too tart, try balancing with more honey. What's your FG looking like? Try bringing your SG up to 1.020, taste, then 1.030, taste, then 1.035, so on and so forth until you find the right sweetness level that offsets the tartness. Raspberries in mead are very acidic, which become much more palatable once they are balanced against the sweetness of the honey."
mead,3a5fjt,maximumtaco,3,Wed Jun 17 17:42:20 2015 UTC,"Good be.  FG was right around 1.00. I diluted with 2 -  16oz bottles of water since it was very strong and the raspberries in primary/secondary took up a lot of space, so i back-filled volume"
mead,3a5fjt,i_forget_my_userids,2,Wed Jun 17 18:15:30 2015 UTC,"I've back filled with water before as well, but it never works out for me. Remember when your diluting alcohol with water your also diluting all of the flavors within it. Definitely add honey to get back around 1.020 or so, and then let it sit for a few weeks as you might get re-fermentation. Adding raspberries wouldn't hurt either, but you will get volume loss again, so that's up to you.  It's save-able for sure, no worries."
mead,3a5fjt,maximumtaco,3,Wed Jun 17 18:37:29 2015 UTC,"hhmm.. Good to know. Thanks for the information!  That one is actually the ""least bad"" of the batches.  I was more disheartened that when I put in minimal effort and technique, i got the best result.  The raspberry melomel has such a gorgeous color.  No chance of me ever ditching that batch. Even if it turned into cat piss, I'd bottle it in clear bottles just to display haha."
mead,3a5fjt,i_forget_my_userids,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"Oh! I just realized something else. The EC-118 you're using is a champagne yeast. It's going to devour every last bit of sugar in there, leaving you with low body and possibly some higher alcohols if it's under nutrient/temperature stress later in the fermentation. I suggest you take a small amount of honey (maybe 50mL to start if you're just doing 1gal batches), mix it with a tiny bit of warm water to make it easier to blend in, and then rack your mead on top of it in a new bottle. If you have potassium sorbate & metabisulfite you can use those at this point (BOMM recipe has dosages, iirc) to ensure your new sugars don't all get chewed up too, or you can use a step feeding approach. Basically, give your batch a week or two, see if the gravity is dropping, when it does, add a tiny bit more honey. It's very easy to oversweeten, so be careful. You can feed it a bit at a time until the yeast finally can't do anymore and you get a stable gravity at whatever level of sweetness you like. The added body and sweetness will help offset the alcohol as well as the acid from the berries.  Sorry for the many posts, just been tabbing over to the thread as I'm working and thinking about what else could have been giving you trouble  :)"

mead,3a5fjt,Adderkleet,5,Wed Jun 17 14:20:13 2015 UTC,"Actually, I just did a custom Google search, and even the oldest JAOM recipes I could find says ""it should clear on its own after 2 months"" and a few lines later ""its ready to drink when it clears."" You and I must have read a non-original recipe.   Here's the oldest one I found:  Joe Mattioli's Ancient Orange and Spice Mead  It is so simple to make and you can make it without much equipment and with a multitude of variations. This could be a first Mead for the novice as it is almost fool proof. It is a bit unorthodox but it has never failed me or the friends I have shared it with. (snip)...it will be sweet, complex and tasty.   1 gallon batch   3 1/2 lbs Clover or your choice honey or blend (will finish sweet)   1 Large orange (later cut in eights or smaller rind and all)   1 small handful of raisins (25 if you count but more or less ok)   1 stick of cinnamon   1 whole clove ( or 2 if you like - these are potent critters)   optional (a pinch of nutmeg and allspice )( very small )   1 teaspoon of Fleishmann’s bread yeast ( now don't get holy on me--- after all this is an ancient mead and that's all we had back then)   Balance water to one gallon   Process:   Use a clean 1 gallon carboy   Dissolve honey in some warm water and put in carboy   Wash orange well to remove any pesticides and slice in eights --add orange (you can push em through opening big boy -- rinds included -- its ok for this mead -- take my word for it -- ignore the experts)   Put in raisins, clove, cinnamon stick, any optional ingredients and fill to 3 inches from the top with cold water. ( need room for some foam -- you can top off with more water after the first few day frenzy)   Shake the heck out of the jug with top on, of course. This is your sophisticated aeration process.   When at room temperature in your kitchen, put in 1 teaspoon of bread yeast. ( No you don't have to rehydrate it first-- the ancients didn't even have that word in their vocabulary-- just put it in and give it a gentle swirl or not)(The yeast can fight for their own territory)   Install water airlock. Put in dark place. It will start working immediately or in an hour. (Don't use grandma's bread yeast she bought years before she passed away in the 90's)( Wait 3 hours before you panic or call me) After major foaming stops in a few days add some water and then keep your hands off of it. (Don't shake it! Don't mess with them yeastees! Let them alone except its okay to open your cabinet to smell every once in a while.   Racking --- Don't you dare   additional feeding --- NO NO   More stirring or shaking -- Your not listening, don't touch   After 2 months and maybe a few days it will slow down to a stop and clear all by itself. (How about that) (You are not so important after all) Then you can put a hose in with a small cloth filter on the end into the clear part and siphon off the golden nectar. If you wait long enough even the oranges will sink to the bottom but I never waited that long. If it is clear it is ready. You don't need a cold basement. It does better in a kitchen in the dark. (Like in a cabinet) likes a little heat (70-80). If it didn't work out... you screwed up and didn't read my instructions (or used grandma's bread yeast she bought years before she passed away) . If it didn't work out then take up another hobby. Mead is not for you. It is too complicated.  If you were successful, which I am 99% certain you will be, then enjoy your mead. When you get ready to make different mead you will probably have to unlearn some of these practices I have taught you, but hey--- This recipe and procedure works with these ingredients so don't knock it. It was your first mead. It was my tenth. Sometimes, even the experts can forget all they know and make good ancient mead."
mead,3a5fjt,i_forget_my_userids,2,Wed Jun 17 14:39:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, JAO is ready to drink in just a few months.  But it also ages well.  I make it in a 6 gallon carboy.  After the fruit falls, I rack it into as 5 gallon carboy and let it sit for a year or so.  I haven't had any older than five or six years, but I imagine it keeps getting better for some time."

I've a feeling mine is as good as it is going to get, and unfortunately that isn't good enough for me. I think there's one bottle left, I'll try it at Christmas, which will be >1 year."
mead,3a5fjt,Adderkleet,3,Wed Jun 17 14:25:56 2015 UTC,"I actually just did some research, and I was wrong about the 1 year thing. The oldest recipes I found all implied it was done when it was clear (at about 2 months)."

mead,3a5fjt,Adderkleet,2,Wed Jun 17 14:46:01 2015 UTC,Correct.  It cleared in about 45-60 days.  I racked @ 30 and bottled somewhere after that (left my log at home)

I believe the yeast is almost impossible to get in Ireland, and the amount of aeration and de-gassing makes me worry about contamination/mould quite a bit. Also, I don't have a de-gas method or equipment. I'm making 5L (1.5gal) batches only.  EDIT: I found the friggin' yeast, in stock, from an Irish supplier. well... guess I got a 3rd batch idea."

mead,3a5fjt,Novaius,2,Wed Jun 17 15:31:09 2015 UTC,"That won't fit in a demijohn easily. Also, StarSan is also hard to get here.  Basically, I'm paranoid about bacteria getting into it. Which I probably shouldn't be, but having to do chemistry with Grignard Reagents in Ireland (something that is spoiled by moisture, and you're in a country where daily rain is standard) makes you paranoid about air leaks and exposed solutions."
mead,3a5fjt,ryanelawrence,2,Wed Jun 17 17:29:01 2015 UTC,Well even a long spoon or any stainless will work.  Just getting a nucleation point basically.  You can just boil it in water to sanitize
mead,3a5fjt,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:41:38 2015 UTC,"As long as your equipment is sanitized to start with you should be good. Once the batch is going and has a good starter tossed in, it's going to be really quite safe. Honey is naturally antimicrobial and antioxidant, it should be an easy ferment once you've got your process settled.  If you can't get StarSan, you can always just use potassium metabisulfite, just be sure to let the bottle drain and dry before adding must. You might also want to try Diversol (""the pink stuff""), that might be available if StarSan isn't. It's mainly used as a cleaner (5 min contact) which does wonders with glass, but it also sanitizes if left for 20 minutes. Does need to be rinsed though."
mead,3a5fjt,mjforres,2,Wed Jun 17 20:20:43 2015 UTC,"For degassing you literally just shake the carboy back and forth. Maks sure you leave headroom in the top when you make up your must. Nothing fancy required in the least :)  I use a one-piece S-style airlock and just use a few drops of vodka in it instead of leaving it completely open, but it's a very simple recipe.   Edit: forgot - make sure you make up a large starter from the 1388 and save a jar to do your next brew with. Especially if you're making many small batches, the yeast cost will add up fast. /u/brulosopher has some great tips on /r/homebrewing and on his blog (http://brulosophy.com/methods/yeast-harvesting/). I did my first starters with a big tupperware container with the lid loosely placed over it, just swirled it a few times a day for 2-3 days (keep the lid loose or it'll pop and spray everywhere - don't ask.) and had a great batch ready in about 3 weeks."
mead,3a5fjt,mjforres,3,Wed Jun 17 20:16:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know much of anything. But if I had to make a guess, your yeast started fermenting again after you racked it and did a number on your fruit. They make stuff to stop fermentation more or less so it doesn't do that when you rack it. I'm at work, so I can't find the name of the stuff I have at home waiting for my first hooch."
mead,3a5fjt,Alcoholic_Autonomous,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:12:12 2015 UTC,That's my thought too. I had fruit in primary and secondary. But in secondary it got sour. Before racking into tertiary I added some neutralize r. Looks pretty but tastes awful
mead,3a5fjt,m4050m3,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:20:26 2015 UTC,I believe is is talking about potassium sorbate AKA wine stabilizer. Adding it will prevent further yeast replication. This can be used to halt fermentation at a certain specific gravity
mead,3a5fjt,m4050m3,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:12:48 2015 UTC,"Correct. That's what i used, but I feel like I should have used it before racking into secondary (on top of fresh berries) instead of tertiary.  Because in secondary it got sour."

If you want to experience more mead flavors, off-flavors and where they might be coming from, taste honeys you might not have known about, or get tips from some mead superstars about going pro, then yes.  This sounds like a lot of stuff, but really might only be the first four hours on the second day.  The networking/drinking after the first night was worthwhile though... tasting a lot of meads with the people who made them (amateur and pro) doesn't happen too often.

mead,3a2ho9,TheGremlyn,3,Tue Jun 16 18:39:28 2015 UTC,"While the two are linked, SNA and Starters exist to achieve different goals. I'll start with SNA, which I admittedly understand a little better.    SNA  To start at the beginning, mead musts are nutrient wastelands. To combat this, we use additives to boost the levels of organic materials needed by the yeast to produce ethanol and CO2 from sugars. One particular element, nitrogen, is extremely important.  We add nitrogen from a variety of sources. Some are more easily used by the yeast than others, but all are pretty accessible. A nitrogen addition (from DAP, in particular) causes a frenzy of activity and a spike in fermentation speed. Faster fermentation means higher temperatures, which mean a greater prevalence of off and ""hot"" flavors.  We (""royal we"") discovered that if we break the nutrient additions up into smaller staggered doses, that the yeast are sent into shorter, less intensive frenzies. Temperature doesn't rise as much, off flavors are less prevalent, and mead is more presentable in a shorter period of time.    Starters  Starters are made to build up a healthy yeast colony of an appropriate biomass to achieve several goals:   Ensure that the yeast is able to properly attenuate the wort, which, btw, is extremely nutrient rich compared to mead. Prevent stalled fermentation - beer yeast can be relatively expensive and no one wants to muck around with repitching because their yeast was anemic. Make lag time short and consistent. Beer is less forgiving about infection than wine. Produce the correct/expected level of esters.     So yes, they're related, by they have two very different goals. Could a starter help a mead? Very possibly, especially if you're using temperamental, wild, or questionably dated yeast. I once tried to put together some math for liquid yeast mead starters once. Feel free to peruse that thread. I posted it a year ago, though, and I'm not going back to check my work right now.  In mead making, there are several reasons I don't bother. First, a healthy pitch rate only costs me $2 for 5 gallons - dry yeast is $1 per 5 g pack. Second, rehydrated correctly (especially with a rehydration nutrient), you'll be pitching plenty of cells. Third, mead must, though lacking in nutrition, is something like 95+% attenuable by nearly any yeast you can throw at it, assuming you don't overshoot on alcohol tolerance. Hiccups due to pitch rate are much much less common, or perhaps the effects are more subtle.  I'll x-post this into your /r/homebrewing thread."
mead,3a2ho9,balathustrius,2,Tue Jun 16 19:47:43 2015 UTC,"Most people don't use starters in any winemaking, mead included. It's just not necessary, and you agitate every day during primary to degas a little and push down the fermentation cap. There's also significantly less chance for infection in wine. SNA is a whole other discussion."
mead,3a2ho9,i_forget_my_userids,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:47:58 2015 UTC,"I searched over here a bit to see if anyone had discussed the advantages of either method, but only came up with some posts talking about starters with liquid yeast, but nothing answering the question I am trying to answer."
mead,3a2ho9,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:40:30 2015 UTC,They are not alternatives to each other.  Making a starter is growing the yeast population.  SNA and nutrition is about feeding not stressing the grown population during fermentation.
mead,3a2ho9,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:02:37 2015 UTC,"According to the mead panel I went to at NHC last week, which included Ken Schramm and Michael Fairbrother, nutrients are needed to produce more yeast. My understanding is that some nitrogen needs to be available during fermentation, but healthy yeast will store this intracellularly, and that is mostly done during the growth phase. So if the yeast are given enough volume and the appropriate amounts of nutrients in a starter, then pitching that fully grown starter into your must would accomplish the same end result."
mead,3a2ho9,Bunsomel,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:09:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not disputing that nutrients are needed in a starter.  But, disclosure, I don't make starters at all, I just pitch more.  But I do rehydrate dry wine yeast with GoFerm, a nutrient.  That doesn't change my point that the object of a starter is to grow the population and the object of SNA or nutrients is primarily to give yeast what they need throughout their life cycle.  SNA by definition is staggering nutrients throughout the fermentation.  If you're saying they are advocating front loading all nutrients in a starter and not doing SNA, that's news to me."
mead,3a2ho9,Bunsomel,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:40:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think they were advocating that, per se, but I wondering if the timeline could be reduced from 2-3 days down to 1-2 days for the growth phase of things."
mead,3a2ho9,Sauerkrause,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:54:00 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting thought, one I certainly had never considered doing. I've been suspect for a while that we are generally over-nutrifying our musts, perhaps making a nutrient-rich starter might be a better alternative. I might have to try an exbeeriment on it soon, but my gut tells me there really wouldn't be much difference."
mead,3a20vp,WristViolin,3,Tue Jun 16 16:45:58 2015 UTC,"Well the common denominator is both D47 batches didn't go.  If you bought them together then they may just be bad.  Or you pitched them when the rehydrated yeast and must were > 10C from each other.   You sound like you're on top of the issues otherwise so I see no reason to suspect anything else, really.   edit: the other common denominator is that the two D47 batches were NOT melomels, meaning no fruit which are themselves a nutrition source.  So the D47 batches were traditionals, albeit one had tea.  Honey itself is a poor nutrient source and traditionals without enough nutrients can and do stall or under-attenuate.  It sounds more like your gravity didn't change at all so that points to yeast. But nutrients are more important to those D47 batches, FYI.  Also, D47's ""ideal"" temp range is 59-68F so it could be your temp is too hot.  71B is 59-86F so it has a wider temp range.  If your house is 70F this could be the issue.  Also remember the temps in the fermenter will probably be 5F or more higher than ambient (when fermenting)."
mead,3a20vp,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,2,Tue Jun 16 16:52:26 2015 UTC,"Based on your input, I'm going to go to the LHBS sometime soon and pick up another gallon carboy and make a blueberry melomel with the D47 so I can see the difference. That was one thing I briefly considered as well. Might as well. Can never have too much mead :P   Re to your edit: I've already tossed in more than the recommended amount of nutrient (like 1.5tsp / gallon, and .5 tsp of nutrient and energizer, respectively), and I understand that it's unwise to go too far above that (?) Do you think I should add some more in anyway?   edit: also thanks for the quick response :D"

I'm going to check the gravity after this post and try some other maintenance.  I also measured the temperature! The liquid inside the carboy is currently 70F."
mead,3a20vp,i_forget_my_userids,3,Tue Jun 16 17:12:59 2015 UTC,EC-1118 has an even wider temp range than 71B so that's probably why the bochet got going.  I've only used D47 once and I ferment in my basement which stays 59-63F pretty much all year so I'm not dialed into how finicky some of these yeasts are about temp.  If I were you I'd move it somewhere in the low to mid 60s F.  If that isn't an option look up fermenter swamp cooler and consider doing that in the bathtub for a bit until it gets going.
mead,3a20vp,maximumtaco,2,Tue Jun 16 17:32:10 2015 UTC,"Presently the best I can do is shove the carboy next to one of my AC vents. I'm going to leave it there for a day or so and see what happens.   If nothing I'm going to just call it and pitch some 71B or EC-1118. I think the 1118 is a heartier strain and would probably use the D47 as food, so that might be the better option. We shall see ...   Additionally, I think I'm going to start a blueberry batch with one of my leftover packets of D47 to use as a control.   Thanks again for your input."
mead,3a20vp,balathustrius,3,Tue Jun 16 19:31:35 2015 UTC,"Did you use sulfites (campden tabs)? If so, did you wait 24+ hours to pitch? Sanitation clearly isn't the issue, as you can't even get yeast to grow. You might have had your yeast starter too hot.   I don't even rehydrate anymore. I just sprinkle the dry yeast on top of my aerated must and let it float. I don't stir until I see activity. Doing it that way, every batch has kicked off without a hitch, never had to repitch."
mead,3a20vp,balathustrius,2,Tue Jun 16 16:59:23 2015 UTC,"I do not use any sulfites.   Also, I really don't think I rehydrated too hot, but I suppose I shouldn't rule that out.

mead,3a20vp,balathustrius,2,Tue Jun 16 17:02:55 2015 UTC,"105 is really quite hot imo, I've never had a yeast that suggested rehydration over 90 or so. That might be part of the problem... How much yeast did you pitch? One full packet split between the two one gallon jugs?"
mead,3a20vp,maximumtaco,3,Tue Jun 16 19:36:43 2015 UTC,What yeast do you use?  All the usual suspect Lalvin wine yeasts suggest rehydrating at the 105-109F range.  Of course that's a tight band. If your thermometer is off by much it may be easy to cook them to death.
mead,3a20vp,maximumtaco,2,Tue Jun 16 20:00:32 2015 UTC,"The yeasts I used are all Lalvin brand (assuming you directed your question at me - apologies if it is not) and they all recommend a rehydration temperature of what you indicated.   My thermometer didn't fail me (I have a Fluke 51 thermometer) for the other yeasts I pitched, so I'm guessing my temperature was fine (though naturally it would be daft of me to entirely rule that out)."

Based on that, if it were me, I'd go with a semi-dry batch (although maybe less water, around 1.5 gal. 2.5-3#/gal has been the sweet spot for my mead.)  It might be painful to only end up with a half-dozen bottles, but it'll be a really good half dozen.

mead,39yrwy,Loki_Sunday,3,Tue Jun 16 07:42:24 2015 UTC,"I'd probably make a metheglin or traditional. Melomels tend to overpower the honey flavor, unless the honey is really assertive like a tupelo or buckwheat, or if you're not using enough fruit. If going traditional I'd probably add some oak to age it on for a little extra depth, and in a metheglin I would go easy on the spices so that the honey remains the focus.   If it's a really fantastic honey, I personally prefer not to let it go completely dry. A little residual sugar helps retain that original honey character. If you go with 71B, I'd suggest getting your OG up to 1.135-1.140. It may sound high, but 71B will take a traditional mead straight to 1.000, well beyond it's alcohol tolerance, especially if you are aerating and doing SNA properly. I've personally see it happen 3 times on my own homebrew in the past year or so, and I've heard many others say the same thing.  Also, if doing a traditional/metheglin, consider using potassium-bicarbonate to buffer the pH. I think Ken Schramm has an article on it somewhere, but I can't find it; this link sums it up though."

mead,39vfyt,Bocote,2,Mon Jun 15 05:18:42 2015 UTC,"It has been 6 months to the day since I began this pomegranate melomel, and I had a bit of free time today, so I decided I'd use it bottling up this one gallon batch.  As it stands, the mead ended up very sweet (1.030), but I wasn't intrigued by the idea of pitching 1118 to make it any dryer.  It's quite tasty though -- the tartness of the pomegranate juice and the sweetness of the blueberry honey balance out nicely.  My palate is still very immature, so I'm sorry I can't provide you with more intricate tasting notes.  I think, given another six months or so, this will taste even more spectacular, and I look forward to saving a bottle or two to see how it develops."

mead,39vfyt,Euloque,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:14:39 2015 UTC,"This was one of my very first meads, so I was trying to keep it pretty simple.  I just used Pure Pomegranate juice that I purchased at Chuck's Produce.  I didn't stabilize this mead, just let the yeast go to it's capacity. My process after the first racking was ""forget about it until it's time to bottle.""  Probably not the most responsible thing to do, especially since I used 71B, but it was my method to refrain myself from obsessing over it and acting with impatience, which I have also done in the past."

mead,39vnqp,Double_Naginata,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:21:50 2015 UTC,I would suggest using a different yeast. 71B has an alcohol tolerance of 14%. You might consider using a low tolerance beer yeast.

mead,39v8bv,Davis_a_smith,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:05:50 2015 UTC,That looks really fun. I've always been interested in forced carbonation and doing it with cream soda sounds like it will turn out nicely.

mead,39ured,3bola,6,Sun Jun 14 23:25:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but I think you can do either or! More honey will result in the yeast not being able to eat it all before the alcohol percentage gets too high (which will kill it). Or stopping it with preservatives will cut it off also and result in a sweeter mead"
mead,39ured,guitarpwner,3,Sun Jun 14 23:44:51 2015 UTC,"This.  Once fermentation has completed, you can backsweeten it; without sorbate (which I avoid) or sulfites, the yeast will start fermentation again until they hit their tolerance, at which point more honey will simply make the mead sweeter.  Some people will try to add non-fermentable sugars like maltodextrin to backsweeten, so there's that to think about as well."
mead,39ured,JTehFreakS,2,Mon Jun 15 01:54:05 2015 UTC,"I'd like to modify that statement a little bit.  ""More honey MAY result in the yeast not being able to eat it all.""  It depends on the yeast, fermentation conditions, and exactly how much honey we're talking about. It's very hard to dial in to perfection."
mead,39ured,balathustrius,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:08:17 2015 UTC,You're a godsend! Thank you for the clarification.
mead,39ured,MarsColonist,6,Mon Jun 15 00:00:56 2015 UTC,"Delle units is the typical threshold for yeast to stop working. Its 4.5*the %ABV + the % Residual Sugar.  If its over 65, very unlikely that it will restart once slowed down.  Residual Sugar is a bit of a bitch to calculate as it depends on the starting gravity, and the accurate %ABV (dilution is the major consideration) to be accurate.  You can also pasteurize or sterile filter as alternatives to preservatives."
mead,39ured,CapOnFoam,2,Mon Jun 15 01:19:15 2015 UTC,"The difference is in the amount of sugar in the mead that isn't fermented. There are a few ways to do that.    Use a yeast with a low alcohol tolerance along with a lot of honey, to get a high starting gravity, and hope the yeast peters out before all the sugar is fermented. Add potassium sorbate and potassium metabisulfite during fermentation to stop it. This is less reliable. Complete fermentation, add potassium sorbate and potassium metabisulfite, and add honey back to the mead to add sweetness a couple days later. The yeast won't be able to consume the sugars.   I personally rely on the last option and find it highly reliable."
mead,39ured,im_pythonic,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:12:55 2015 UTC,I also rely on option number 3 to get my meads exactly where I want them.
mead,39ured,thinker99,2,Mon Jun 15 12:28:39 2015 UTC,"To keep residual sweetness you need to make the yeast stop eating.  You can do that with sulfites etc. which either kill or make them unable to reproduce, or you can do it with the alcohol content.  In general your yeast will eat about 100 points (1.100 to 1.000) before the alcohol finishes them off (varies by strain), so if you want a 1.030 FG start at 1.130."
mead,39ured,Dirtbag_Actual,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:12:32 2015 UTC,Using what yeast?
mead,39ured,thinker99,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:24:51 2015 UTC,"It varies based on the attenuation ability of the yeast, but using WLP720 I usually see a bit below 100 points."
mead,39tn7b,mahalambda,3,Sun Jun 14 17:42:50 2015 UTC,"The only conical fermenters I've seen are stainless steel.  I have a 7-gal stainless steel fermenter.  They make racking extremely easy, and the wide mouth makes cleaning a breeze. But yes, there is one major con -- the price.  I purchased my conical fermenter because I wanted to make kombucha with it.  I needed a wide mouth so the SCOBY could grow, so carboys were not an option. Brewing kombucha in plastic is also a big no-no. So, unless I wanted to stick to those annoying 1 gallon glass jars, stainless steel seemed to be the only option.  After I purchased it, however, I never used it for kombucha, so I used it for mead making instead.  In short, conical will save you a bit of time and hassle, but when it really comes down to it, it's not worth the 200 dollar price tag."
mead,39tn7b,cmoncur,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:04:50 2015 UTC,"But... what if it's not 200 dollars?  What if it was just over 110$ for an 8 Gal tank?  What if it was 40$ for a 2.5 Gal tank?  I gotta say, I was thinking about buying a glass carboy. But, for the same price, the conical fermenter, while smaller, looks awfully nice."
mead,39tn7b,a_Mazing_Nurse,2,Sun Jun 14 18:35:27 2015 UTC,"Then I guess it's up to the brewer to decide whether they'd rather spend 110 dollars on that 7.9 gallon, plus the money for the floor stand if they don't want it mounted to their wall, or whether they'd rather spend 38 dollars on a 6 gallon glass carboy, or even less for plastic.  Similarly, a 1 gallon glass jug that can be used for fermenting is $3.50 at my local homebrew store.  I love my conical fermenter, but if I knew it was only going to be used for mead at the time of purchase, I would have just opted for glass and saved myself the money.  EDIT: Price.  Here's a 6 gallon glass carboy price at my local homebrew store.  I assume it's pretty similar around the nation."
mead,39tn7b,cmoncur,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:43:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah...  I think I'd rather get 3, 6-Gal glass than the 8-Gal plastic.  But still, it's... interesting."

mead,39s1l5,ColinFeely,2,Sun Jun 14 05:01:44 2015 UTC,"To expand on what the other commanders said, there are basically two approaches, carbonating in the bottle and carbonating with a keg and CO2, then filling bottles from the keg. Carbonating in the bottle requires adding a calculated amount of easily fermented priming sugar or more honey if you want. Your yeast would still need to be alive, as well. I'm not sure how bottle carbing is affected by stabilizers or super long secondaries where the yeast might cease to be viable. This calculator http://www.tastybrew.com/calculators/priming.html can calculate what you need and lists CO2 volumes for all the BJCP categories of beer. After you add the appropriate amount of priming sugar/honey to the whole batch, you just make sure it's dissolved then transfer to bottles and cap and the yeast does the rest. Alternatively, I know that folks sell ""carbonation tablets"" (uniform by weight sugar pills) that you just put in each bottle before capping instead of doing the priming sugar batch thing. Cheers!"
mead,39s1l5,SolemnFir,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:38:27 2015 UTC,Carbonation tablets seem very easy to use. Do they have a danger of blowing the bottles.
mead,39s1l5,StormBeforeDawn,2,Sun Jun 14 15:51:55 2015 UTC,"Not if you don't put in too much and you use BEER bottles. Wine bottles are not meant to be pressurized. Champagne bottles work, but are expensive."
mead,39s1l5,SolemnFir,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:24:33 2015 UTC,I think the bottles I have are for beer. Is there a difference in seal/possibility to explode in caps vs. corks?
mead,39s1l5,Davis_a_smith,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:00:40 2015 UTC,"I haven't used carbonation drops myself before, but I would imagine that they wouldn't carry any extra risk over just adding the priming sugar to the whole batch."
mead,39s1l5,i_forget_my_userids,4,Mon Jun 15 04:53:11 2015 UTC,"I am currently force carbing a mead. If you have the equipment (keg, co2 tank, pipes), it is a very easy process. Fill the keg with your mead, pressurize to 20psi for 3days, then bottle (you may drop the pressure after the 3days to bottle to 10psi...)  There are many instructions and ed-videos on this on YouTube.  Doing it this way makes the carbonation more consistent. I have not had too much success with consistency when using priming sugar, but that may just be me and the yeast I tend to use."
mead,39s1l5,garrettrinpoche,2,Sun Jun 14 06:26:32 2015 UTC,"It works the same as beer or champagne, depending on how carbonated you go. You'll need bottles capable of holding appropriate levels of carbonation. Regular wine bottles will explode. Beer bottles can't hold champagne levels of carbonation. There are all kinds of resources you can use to determine the amount of priming sugar you need. Just Google search ""priming sugar calculator [beer, champagne]"" and you should find what you're looking for.

mead,39s1l5,Alcoholic_Autonomous,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:32:35 2015 UTC,"Poor man's carbonation, I don't know if this method would be frowned upon by the genpop. I saw a guy in Belize carbonate his wine this way: He had a CO2 bottle (got it from an industrial supplier/welding shop) and a nozzle that would accomodate a soda bottle's threads. He'd funnel some of his wine (made from sugar can, it was sooo good) in to a 1 liter bottle, thread it to the line from his CO2, quickly open and close the valve, shake it for a couple of seconds (the shaking motion is what actually carbonates the wine - more shaking = stronger carbonation), and voila.   I'm thinking you could easily use this method and then funnel it in to your bottles and seal them. Wouldn't have any more carbonation than soda.  Again, please accept my apologies if this is not what you're looking for, but I thought it was a nice way to obtain carbonation in a hurry."

mead,39s8sw,Aurimass,7,Sun Jun 14 06:46:53 2015 UTC,"Yaaay! I'm the first one to a thread.   Do I need to peel then skin off?   I would recommend peeling them as the peeling isn't adding any flavor to the mead.   After adding should I punch the cap regularly?   When you feel there's too much CO2 built up, sure. But see the point about the bag.   Will it clear or should I rack it after some time?   Depends - most meads will clear if given enough time, but you're introducing a fruit that has a loooooot of pulp/ little pieces. Compounded with the fact that peaches contain pectin, the likes of which can cause cloudiness and a ""gelling"" of your mead. So, you're going to need to rack it more than you would if it was a traditional as well as using pectin enzyme to break down said pectin.  Ultimately, you can save yourself a lot of trouble if you use a brewer's bag, or a reasonable substitute. What these lovely buggers do is contain the loose, lee-generating fruit matter to a bag, the likes of which you can simply pull right out when you're done with the peaches. Additionally, a bag will prevent too serious of a cap from forming.  If you don't want to put the bag into the mead, you can still save yourself a LOT of effort by pureeing the peaches and straining the pulp through the butcher's bag, only putting the peach juice into the mead. This'll still give you pulp and lees, but considerable less.  Regardless, PECTIN ENZYME. SERIOUSLY"

mead,39s8sw,a_Mazing_Nurse,2,Tue Jun 16 08:37:07 2015 UTC,"how much of pectin enzyme should I use for 5 gallon batch?   My enzyme recommends 1/2tsp/Gal   How long should I keep the brewer's bag with peaches in the mead?   If you are intending to ferment the peach juice, until fermentation has stopped (take your FG reading).  If you are trying to aim for flavor, use the mead calculator on the sidebar to estimate the sugar content, aim for the sweetness you want, and add accordingly to taste (meaning, add the peaches until you get to the taste you want, or are at the max gravity you want).  With that last point, some brewers use wine tannin to give a ""bite"" that cuts a mead that has gotten too sweet.  Oh, and before I forget, 1.030 is usually sweet, 1.020 is usually semi-sweet, 1.015 is usually semi-dry, and anything below 1.010 is usually dry.  I say usually, because sweetness can be subjective and change depending on the mead."

Juice and Zest your citrus, no need to add the flesh, and keeping the pith out will also keep from picking up unwanted bitterness. gently push down the fruit into the must at least once a day for the first several days (this is called ""punching the cap""), this keeps the fruit moist and helps keep bad things from growing on the fruit that is above the surface level (can't give the mead any flavor if it's not in the mead).

In a few months it should be both better and clearer. Cold temperatures help clearing as well.  If you can't wait and want to bottle as soon as possible, I've heard good things about Super-Kleer.  What's your recipe, specifically the honey/water ratio and if you know, OG and FG?"
mead,39o5pa,DeathtoPants,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:55:53 2015 UTC,2 grams of yeast nutrient   What brand and type? That sounds kind of light.
mead,39mvzm,ReduceSanity,3,Fri Jun 12 21:38:33 2015 UTC,"1.160 to 1.050 is 15.0%.  71B is capable of more, but it may be just about done as it's rated at 14%.  It's going to be pretty sweet if it stops at 1.050.  edit: 1.160 doesn't even take into account the sugar from the cherries.  As for your nutrients, the yeast can't assimilate DAP beyond 9% ABV.   However you are using Fermaid O (not DAP) and the yeast can use that througout, reportedly.   In my opinion you have nutrients from fruit, and you've already used a lot more than I do for 1 gallon batches so I personally would stop with nutrients.  Though I wouldn't want it to finish at 1.050-ish (though I have had that happen and still enjoyed it).  It's unlikely to finish much lower than around 1.042 or 1.040 as that's around 16%.  People get 16% from 71B (including me) but you most likely won't get much more. Personally I'd stir it up once a day for a few more days to keep the yeast in suspension and hopefully have them knock more of the sugar out.  I'd wait until about the 10 day-2 week mark and rack it into another fermenter.  Ideally do it when the fermentation is really slow but not over so that the headspace still fills up with CO2 once you've racked it."
mead,39mvzm,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,2,Fri Jun 12 22:13:23 2015 UTC,"1.160 is a super high OG if you're using 71B. You have a couple options that I know of. You can wait for the yeast to finish up, rack, and pitch Lalvin EC-1118 champaign yeast. It can handle a much higher alcohol content (18% or 19% IIRC) and should ferment it down to 1.030-1.020, which is right in the FG range for a sweet mead. Another option would be to stir it up really well (try to mix the yeast back into suspension) and transfer it to a larger container and add water to lower the gravity a bit. I've never personally done this, so I would wait for some advice from some more seasoned mazers before trying this to make sure you don't water it down too much and take away from the body/aromas."
mead,39mvzm,smp501,2,Fri Jun 12 23:18:16 2015 UTC,"as a champagne yeast, ec-1118 may also totally dry it out to rocket fuel if his fermentation temperature is on the high side."
mead,39mvzm,new-Baltimoreon,2,Sat Jun 13 15:32:21 2015 UTC,"let it sit in primary for a month before you rack it off the spent fruit and let it clear up in secondary. You're on the right track, but it sounds like fermentation got a little away from you. Keep the temps in the low to mid 60's and let it ride. No need to add any more nutrient really, the fruit is helping to buffer the need for it.   Don't worry, it will be fine. Give it at least three months from pitching before you bottle."

If you do a traditional (just honey, water, yeast) then your nutrients are very important because honey is nutrient poor.  Without supplementary nutrients you will likely either get a stalled fermentation or it will stress the yeast and produce a harsh product that takes much longer to mellow.  If you use fruit then the fruit often provides a lot of the nutrients so yeast nutrient is still used but possibly less amounts and it's less critical to the process."
mead,39mlxj,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:43:32 2015 UTC,Ok thanks!
mead,39mlxj,new-Baltimoreon,2,Fri Jun 12 22:18:08 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that ""yeast energizer"" is just a different style of nutrient by LD Carlson, much as Fermaid has N, O, and K, which are different blends of nutrient sources.  if you read the ingredients, it's DAP + autolysed yeast hulls, and micronutrients from minerals and some other stuff... LD Carlson's ""yeast nutrient"" is basically just DAP."
mead,39mlxj,balathustrius,2,Sat Jun 13 18:59:09 2015 UTC,"Read this white paper I wrote.  I'm afraid there isn't really a short answer to yeast nutrition in mead. However, what I linked there is about as accessible as I could make it.  The biggest thing is that ""nutrient"" vs ""energizer"" is meaningless nomenclature. Marketing. Follow good nutrition practices and your title question becomes almost meaningless. I don't mean to sound insulting when I say that - tone is difficult to convey on the Internet."

Wine and mead must isn’t even boiled . . . and you can’t give honey to babies because it has botulism spores in it, right?  The pH of both wine and mead musts are below 4.6 initially, and won’t support the growth of C. botulinum."
mead,39g6ee,Adderkleet,2,Fri Jun 12 00:26:03 2015 UTC,"Adults have gut bacteria that can handle the spores just fine.  When adults get botulism, it's from ingesting preformed toxins.  Babies don't have well developed gut flora like us, so they are vulnerable to ingesting spores.  These spores end up in honey, and so you shouldn't give them honey to babies.  It's totally fine for adults though."
mead,39g6ee,LongUsername,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:58:21 2015 UTC,"Infants under one year have not developed the ability to deal with large portions of botulism spores. Although, as an adult you should not worry about them because you have the enzymes required to neutralize the spores.   These spores are EVERYWHERE, often found in soil. Which stands to reason as to how they get into the hive."
mead,39g6ee,Adderkleet,0,Thu Jun 11 20:50:47 2015 UTC,"Botulism is more of a ""dented can"" disease. The spores are almost impossible to destroy, but the disease itself won't occur in open-air or air-tight containers. And 6% alcohol is enough to stop any spores maturing and producing toxins."
mead,39g6ee,fantasticsid,2,Thu Jun 11 18:07:29 2015 UTC,"disease itself won't occur in air-tight containers.   Uhmm.. Botulisim THRIVES in air tight containers, which is why it's an issue in home canned goods.  You need either an high suger/acidic/alcoholic enough environment or to pressure can it to prevent botulisim in ""air tight"" mason jar."
mead,39g6ee,QVCatullus,-1,Thu Jun 11 19:43:51 2015 UTC,"I had to look this up again, because while i know C. botulinum is an obligate anaerobe, I also know a properly sealed can is unlikely to result in poisoning. It is cans with dents/rust or non-airtight containers that are a greater risk, but I cannot find any details on why.  This is something I learned in college 5+ years ago, so I don't have a clear memory of it. But in my mind, botulism needs very low oxygen levels. High levels kill it, but ""safe"" cans inhibit its growth. Maybe the spores can get into dented cans and contaminate the food within, rather than the spores already being inside and growing after a dent/tear is made."
mead,39g6ee,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,3,Thu Jun 11 21:59:21 2015 UTC,"Because the contents of cans are sterilized under pressure, but open cans are no longer sterile, and the contents are a pretty good medium for Clostridium."
mead,39g6ee,JonasTorgersen,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:09:07 2015 UTC,"Even when food is (home) canned properly, it is still important to ensure that the pH is outside of botulinum's range. Heating (at the temperatures home canning equipment provides) alone does not guarantee the destruction of spores -- the temperature at which spores are destroyed is dependent on the pH. Home-canned tomato sauce that isn't sufficiently acidified occasionally causes botulism.  *Edit to make clear that home canning in particular is vulnerable to botulinum without adequate safeguards. Commercial canneries can apply higher heat, but botulism still rarely survives commercial canning, as in 1978 with the Alaska salmon poisoning."
mead,39g6ee,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:39:41 2015 UTC,Does this mean it could be an issue in a low alcohol hydromel?
mead,39g6ee,JonasTorgersen,2,Thu Jun 11 18:17:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, for infants. Your body is able to render the spores unusable before they have the chance to germinate, so anything over one year old does not have to worry about contracting botulism."
mead,39g6ee,Adderkleet,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:06:40 2015 UTC,I meant more like is < 6% abv (adderkleet's figure) a favorable environment for botulism spores to produce toxins that even an adult human body could not deal with.    As opposed to eating honey with spores directly which is apparently an unfavorable environment to produce toxins.
mead,39g6ee,TheShandyMan,2,Thu Jun 11 20:19:53 2015 UTC,"After some research, I have come to a conclusion: I don't know. There are conflicting pieces of evidence, so I'm not sure which to listen to. It does thrive in low-oxygen, non-acidic enviornments, which a hydromel is. It can be prevented by a simple pasteurisation if three minutes, but using raw honey still leaves this up to consideration. The only thing mentioned was 'improperly canned food', which is a bit vague.   Now that I have mentioned all the reason for it to grow, there is still one thing that I will mention that makes me question if this should be considered a risk. Why would it grow? A mydromel offers very few resources for the spores to germinate. There may be spores there which can want to grow, yet they do not have what they need at hand to do so."

mead,39g6ee,Krinberry,2,Thu Jun 11 21:52:42 2015 UTC,Beer is typically boiled during the brew process which should kill it; however as others have pointed out most adults should be okay unless you have a weird scenario where the mead has a high pH allowing the spores to actually develop prior to ingestion.

mead,39eeho,frenchlitgeek,2,Thu Jun 11 04:32:10 2015 UTC,"You don't really ever need staggered nutrient additions.  Check the sidebar for mead calculators to see if your honey quantities are good. 4lbs is a lot, and that one will probably be quite sweet.   One month isn't very long. Most people here don't bottle for many months. I doubt your mead will be clear, and it'll likely have quite a bit of noticeable sediment in the bottom of the bottles. You'd be better off changing containers after a couple weeks, then bottling after 6 months.   You probably don't need acid.   Mix the honey and water very well before adding yeast. You don't have to do the campden tablet thing if you don't want, but I usually do."

mead,39eeho,cowboys703,2,Tue Jun 16 02:55:42 2015 UTC,"I think the rule of thumb for staggered nutrient additions is   at the start  2/3 of your OG  1/3 of your OG  Unfortunately, with one gallon batches that can be hard to judge. I'd just do a nutrient addition every 24-31 hours or so.   As far as bottling goes I recommend waiting at least 2 months or so. After one month rack it into another jar and if fermentation is complete cold crash it. Second month comes to a close rack and cold crash again. Then bottle. I did this on my most recent one and have noticed (for the first time) absolutely zero sediment at the bottom of my bottles."
mead,39eeho,cowboys703,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:48:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I should cold crash before racking, right? This cold crash would help me racking, or do you have another reason to cold crash (and that explains cold crashing after racking?)"

mead,39blj3,Strid,6,Wed Jun 10 17:36:46 2015 UTC,"As a chemist, I'm so damn suspicious of this.   lactic acid bacteria found in the honey stomach of bees, mixed with honey itself, could cure chronic wounds in horses that had proved resistant to treatment.   So lactic acid bacteria can cure chronic wounds? In vitro, yes. in vivo? Not tested. Heck, they even say themselves, this mead is to be drunk and then blood tests carried out to see if anything ends up in the human bloodstream."
mead,39blj3,Adderkleet,3,Thu Jun 11 08:10:59 2015 UTC,Sounds like a journalist getting way ahead of the scientists he or she is covering.   Not unusual.   So the scientists want to test if there might be in vivo benefits to mead.  That does seem a reasonable thing to explore.  I'm pretty sure people ascribed health benefits to mead in the past and some metheglins were brewed as medicine.
mead,39blj3,Moonpile,2,Thu Jun 11 12:33:20 2015 UTC,"Technically, they're looking at whether lactic acid bacteria compounds can be drunk via mead and enter the bloodstream, since this may have health benefits. They're not testing for benefits of drinking mead.  And most of their hypothesis is based on lactic acid bacteria and honey being known anecdotally and historically as ""medicine"" - which is fine; that's how we found a lot of useful drugs."
mead,39blj3,Adderkleet,2,Thu Jun 11 13:04:54 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with your scepticism. Honey is used topically to treat chronic wounds in horses. Its primary antimicrobial property, however, lies in its hypertonicity. Nothing can flourish in honey without dilution. But that has absolutely nothing to do with the study in the article. I'm not sure why it was even mentioned. It would be interesting to see if any of the compounds survive the digestive system, but we're not looking at a new miracle drug here. I will continue to drink my mead, though. Just in case :)"
mead,39blj3,EpicViking999,5,Thu Jun 11 14:17:42 2015 UTC,"So i guess my question is, if you clarify said mead does that strip the benefits out? obviously using kmeta would be out of the question but it sounds like they are basically just using raw honey and using the bacteria and yeast already present to ferment. meaning.... make a must and wait?   this is interesting and i might look into it more. i think some of the apiaries near me do raw, unpasturized honey."
mead,39blj3,Aramillio,5,Wed Jun 10 18:00:13 2015 UTC,"do so, get as raw and unprocessed as you can. if you can't cut down the honey comb yourself and toss that into a pot. :)  I still use mead yeasts as i haven't been able to get sufficient quantities of raw honey, only minimally processed from farmer's markets and local.  but i basically do exactly this.  honey, water, yeast. put in glass carboy with bubbler, watch your temps and let it work until fermentation is done. I might rack to another carboy but i usually just replace the bubbler with a silicon bung and then store in cool, dark location for a year. bottle and enjoy.  it clears nicely (touch of haze at the most usually) without intervention, at least in my case. I tend to use quite a bit of honey and it comes out sweet and strong. the way i like it :)"

mead,39963x,CacTye,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:42:41 2015 UTC,I put pectic enzymes in the secondary but not the tertiary. So I am sure I will lose some of the color as it clears. But I used pure cranberry juice instead of whole or crushed cranberries

mead,399ouu,ReduceSanity,3,Wed Jun 10 06:59:41 2015 UTC,"Those 2 gallon buckets rarely show airlock activity, so I wouldn't worry about it at all. The seal on them is nearly always poor, but that's fine during primary fermentation. Just let it be, and it will do it's job. If anything though, try to lower the temperature down to the mid 60's if you can.   Your recipe looks perfect to me, but next time you might want to choose a cherry that is more tart/sour. Sour cherry varieties typically lend balance to an otherwise overly sweet mead. If you taste it after three months and it's lacking balance you might want to try adding some acid blend to bring up the tartness.   Otherwise it sounds like its going to be a kickass mead. Good luck & cheers!"
mead,399ouu,Bunsomel,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:47:43 2015 UTC,"How long has it been since pitch? Did you rehydrate? Your gravity is a bit on the high side, but I doubt that this is the main reason for your lag. There is no need to worry unless you have yet to see any activity after 72 hours."

mead,398t84,garrettrinpoche,2,Wed Jun 10 03:10:02 2015 UTC,"looks good to me! You can still buy a hydrometer to measure what your final gravity (fg) is. This will tell you if the wine is dry or if it is sweet, and knowing the fg of what you are drinking will help you calibrate your own tastes.   Sounds like you didn't use any fruit or spices, so it's just a traditional mead using honey + yeast + water, right? In my experience, these tend take longer to hit their stride. give them time. The carboy you racked into will start to clear in the next few months. When you think it's as clear as it will ever get, go ahead and bottle it. Patience will be rewarded in meadmaking, I promise.  If you want to add a little depth, you could consider adding some oak cubes to your carboy. I usually use 1 ounce in 5 gallons for a 4-8 weeks, so for one gallon you could probably get away with .2 ounces in the same timeframe."
mead,398t84,Bunsomel,2,Wed Jun 10 11:58:05 2015 UTC,"Lalvin 1118, never any question about the alcohol with that yeast.  It sounds fine. Let it mellow for a while."

You can also make weaker or ""short"" meads that are cider strength and ready sooner. They tend to be dry though unless you have advanced techniques at your disposal."
mead,398t84,rocky6501,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:24:04 2015 UTC,"I have done one batch of mead to date, it turned out pretty good.  I do regret going through several bottles that were slightly astringent after tasting the one left for about 14 months, time truely makes a difference."
mead,398t84,Firefl1,0,Wed Jun 10 03:42:42 2015 UTC,"Umm, I'm not entirely certain, but check to see if Costco honey is actual honey or mixed w/ corn syrup.  A lot of them are.  That might give you an alcohol character this early in the fermentation.    Other than that, its hard to tell.  Without a hydrometer, you're kinda wandering around in the woods without a compass.  You should get one and keep track of things if you want to consistently make things that taste good.      Other than that, go try a mead and see how it compares, silly."

mead,398t84,frenchlitgeek,4,Wed Jun 10 16:54:03 2015 UTC,"1, try a cyser or hydromel. They use less honey so they will be cheaper to make and they have a quicker turn around time.  Wait 1yr for 17% or wait 1month for 10%?  2, look up staggered nutrient additions and follow the schedules. You're already doing nutrient additions w/ DAP.

Trying to fill them with a bottling wand is very difficult because the wand wants to slide off the punt, but the non-punt area of the bottle bottom isn't large enough to depress the spring mechanism in the bottling wand.    This probably won't be a problem buying punted bottles from the homebrew supply.  FWIW when I was reusing wine bottles for my mead, I usually only had 1-2 problem bottles per 24.

It can be such a pain with the bottling wand to keep the tip depressed on the punted bottles that I've slowly replaced them with non-punted bottles.  I also tend to age my mead in the carboy for a good while and rack off carefully so my bottles tend to stay quite clear of any sediment anyways.

I usually start botteling when the mead is still slightly cloudy (I don't have the time to wait for 6 moths while my mead is chilling in my aparatus). This way I get bottels of varying starting clarity. This gives a whole lot more variation in terms of bottles. I will have some Grade A bottles whit little to no seidment at all, and osme bottles who have a couple of mm in sediment. The last bottle I fill usually has the most and usually clears up quite quickly to get on the same level of the rest.   Also, to get the last sediment out of it (within reason, that is) I re-bottle them after a few months so I can get very clear meads."

Then when I added a few meads and had to cold distill it twice to cut down on volume it tasted mostly like alcohol with a slight honey finish. About a month ago I added the dregs of my raspberry cyser to finish up the bottle and now it actually tastes pretty good.  Right now it tastes lightly of raspberries and booze with a nice honey finish. I can't believe it all came from the buffer inch.

mead,391h7u,cowboys703,2,Mon Jun 8 20:36:30 2015 UTC,Any good wine bars in your area? I usually just run in to grab a bottle and ask if they have any they're about to throw out
mead,391h7u,alwaystacobell,2,Mon Jun 8 22:55:33 2015 UTC,"What kind/size of bottle are you looking for? Is this just for personal consumption? Would you re-use bottles that had alcohol in them already?  I've seen people bottle home brew/mead/hard cider in Steam Whistle and Mill Street bottles many times. I don't like using their bottles, simply because it takes them out of their cycle. However, if you come across the Mill Street seasonal beers (the ones with the paper labels) those ones are pretty good for bottling. Just soak the label off, sanitize, and you're good to go."

mead,391h7u,EndlessSandwich,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:27:58 2015 UTC,"This.  You can usually find these type of bottles for sale, but when I looked I would have been buying for something like $2.75/ea or just spend the $3.25/ea for Grolsch.  For larger ones: 750mL - PC black label lemon/lime/grapefruit/whatever-other-flavours, 1L - Il Grezzo from Costco (I think) but they take some work to get clean.  I really discourage the Ikea ones; a buddy of mine got those and I found one leaked because the gasket is barely big enough for the neck."
mead,391h7u,soingee,2,Tue Jun 9 15:15:52 2015 UTC,Find a local Italian restaurant. Eat there a few times... casually ask what they do with their bottles at the end of each night. Ask if they would save them for you and let you buy and pick them up at $2 / bottle at the end of the night.   Take them home. Clean them. Sanitize them.

They're SO much easier to bottle with because you don't have to worry about corks and you can reuse them over and over again.

For a whole fruit recipe I'd probably go 1/2 my peach in the primary with none of the raspberry, then a few pounds of raspberry and the other half of my peaches in secondary."
mead,38yptk,hecticdialectic,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:04:41 2015 UTC,Be sure to use lots in both primary and secondary. Peach flavor is very subtle.
mead,38yptk,BoogerTom,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:48:00 2015 UTC,does the secondary fruit ferment ? i dont understand it
mead,38yptk,swampcreek,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:18:51 2015 UTC,"It might or it might not.  Secondary is used as shorthand way to describe ""after the primary fermentation is dying down or over"" or sometimes to mean ""after the first racking"" so it refers to secondary fermenter.  It doesn't necessarily mean a second fermentation.    Depending upon when a person adds things ""to secondary"" they may or may not ferment.  Usually when people say to add fruit to secondary or BOTH primary and secondary they just mean to add it after the primary ferment is mostly over so that more natural fruit flavor survives.     If fruit is added to primary only then the yeast are probably going to consume most of the sugars in the fruit and so it will taste less like the actual fruit.  Whether it ferments in secondary mostly depends on whether the yeast are at their alcohol tolerance or not at this point."

mead,38yk4k,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,4,Sun Jun 7 22:59:03 2015 UTC,"Started life as a 3 gallon batch on 11/26/2014.  Recipe:   7.8 lbs Gunter's clover honey 9.6 oz Frontier hibiscus, cut and sifted 2.1 oz ginger (for secondary) 0.3 oz cinnamon (for secondary, 1/2 ceylon 1/2 cassia) 10 grams 71B-1122 yeast rehydrated in 12.5 grams GoFerm edit: your desired nutrient regimen OG: 1.098 FG: 1.002 ABV: 12.8%  Backsweetened to: 1.013   I pretty much followed /u/balathustrius recipe.  Steeped the hibiscus in 1.5 gallons water at 150-160F for 2 hours. OG was 1.098.  I accidentally spiced the full amounts for a 5 gallon batch (3.5 oz ginger and 0.5 oz cinnamon) so I racked off them after 4 days.  This batch stayed at 1.020 for a few months but after adding the spices it kicked back up and finished at 1.002.  I stabilized and backsweetened to 1.013 on 05/11/2015.  Yielded:   6x750ml 10x375ml 6x187ml a glass to drink"

mead,38yk4k,balathustrius,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:14:04 2015 UTC,I just finished a 375ml.  It's good stuff.  Very well balanced and the spices seem perfect and linger in the throat.  The cinnamon seems to be the star of the show but it's a good balance of the four elements.  I'm wondering what backsweetening with a honey with more character would do.

mead,38zpnb,DrunkFishBreatheAir,3,Mon Jun 8 04:51:05 2015 UTC,"Racking is important. The lees and what else is in the bottom can make off flavors. Aging is also  important, go with 6 months to a year"
mead,38zpnb,Loki_Sunday,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:25:43 2015 UTC,"Sediment can mess with the flavor of your mead, so you want to avoid siphoning that. You can just siphon from above the sediment if you've let it sit for a while, but you will still get some of course. Filtration is a good idea, but not strictly necessary, you will get a higher-quality product out of it though. You definitely do want it in a new container. As for length of aging, give it a taste now, if you think there's some harsh aspects to the flavor, they'll probably go away with age, so let it age a few months, maybe a year. Should note that most of my advice is from stuff I've read, my actual experience level is roughly yours."
mead,38zpnb,Tychus_Kayle,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:11:36 2015 UTC,"A note on siphoning (aka ""racking"") - you don't have rack through a cheesecloth or anything like that. Get a racking cane or autosiphon. There is a cap on the bottom that directs the in-flow from above it. You'll still get some sediment when it's thick after a first racking, but it'll disperse and settle out again. If you leave behind 99% every time, soon it becomes 1/10,000th of one percent of the original amount after racking only 3 times - a reasonable number of times if you're racking:   initially to get it out of a fermentation bucket into an airtight container or to take it off the initial thick layer of lees after a month. to add sulfite/sorbate, if applicable. to back sweeten, if applicable. just prior to bottling."
mead,38y1g3,fifflarencastswell,13,Sun Jun 7 20:32:21 2015 UTC,This is so cute.   Don't put it in direct sunlight and keep it at room temp at the very least.   If you are going to drink it cold it will not be hurt in the fridge.

That being said, as long as it's not too extreme (80f+) or for extended periods (several months+) you're quite unlikely to screw it up.

mead,38y1g3,DeathtoPants,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:27:12 2015 UTC,I wouldn't want to drink too regularly either. Maybe once every 2 weeks and well within my tolerance levels (which are pretty low).
mead,38y1g3,Adderkleet,5,Mon Jun 8 02:26:08 2015 UTC,"Mead isn't neccessarily sweet, though this one appears to be.  Reserve usually means that it was brewed in that year and aged at the brewery for some time before selling, to my understanding.  Unless you're going to age it for up several months or years, temperature doesn't matter too much, as long as it's not too high (like, don't store it in your car during summer). Room temperature will be fine. You could put it in the fridge if you want to, it won't hurt it or anything, though you'll probably want to take it out a bit in advance to let it warm up before drinking.  If it's a screw cork, just put it back on after pouring and it should be unaffected for a few days. If it's corked, either consider some sort of plug, or grab a friend."
mead,38y1g3,Adderkleet,2,Sun Jun 7 20:47:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation. It appears to be a screw-on type of cap. Does mead taste best somewhat warm/room-temp or is chilled mead a thing?

mead,38uj2i,Gralekgejost,14,Sat Jun 6 23:06:32 2015 UTC,"the following post is going to contain some gross-oversimplification, for the purposes of distilling the topic of yeast into a single comment/reply seriously though, ""Yeast"" is a huge topic, I know people who have devoted their entire carreer to studying yeast and they're still learning so there's no way to suitably give cliff-notes without leaving a whole lot of information out.  commercial brewing yeasts are typically broken down into three basic types: Ale, Lager, and Wine. the first two are obviously Beer yeasts, but they behave differently & like different things.   two other types of common yeast: ""Brewer's Yeast"" that you get at a healthfood store is not suitable for actually brewing anything.  and ""Bread Yeast"": while it is called for in JAOM (Joe's Ancient Orange Mead), there's really no way for the standard home brewer to know exactly what strain of yeast, and therefor what to expect in terms of characteristics, or repeat-ability.    most Mead recipes (other than JAOM) call for some form of Wine Yeast, which are usually denoted by some code such as ""1118"", ""71B"", ""D47"", just to name a few, there are hundreds, and many strains can be found from multiple producers under different names/codes.   these are specific strains that have been collected and isolated from various wineries around the world, and chosen for the characteristics that these strains possess, such as;    Lalvin Ec-1118: which comes from the Champagne region of France,  produces cleanly fermented dry wines with a 'neutral' yeast profile (meaning it doesn't taste like yeasty bread), capable of High Alcohol levels (ABV), and it has relatively high flocculation, meaning that the yeast will drop out of solution when it is done fermenting and leave behind a clear beverage (unlike a low-flocculation yeast like is typically used for german Wit beers, like Hoegarden & Blue-moon, which stay cloudy forever). However: 1118 is an extremely hungry yeast, which can overwhelm subtle flavors, and will easily consume well over it's published tolerance of 18% ABV worth of sugar, and greatly benefits from carefully controlled fermentation temperatures (10° - 15°C / 50° - 60°F), if fermented too warm it can develop ""hot/Fusel/off"" flavors. Lalvin 71B-1122 ""Narbonne"": another French origin, this yeast is less voracious than Champagne strains, and typically tops out close to its published tolerance of 14%ABV (personally I've gotten 14.5% nearly every time I've used it), flocculates well, and can metabolize Malic Acid (common in Apples and several types of fruit) to soften ""Tartness"", and can leave behind ""Fruity"" esters (flavor/aroma compounds), while 71B will still benefit from temperature controlled fermentation, it's preferred temperature range is warmer and broader than what works best for Champagne, 59-89° F / 15° - 30°C  Lalvin ICV D47: bet you'll never guess what country this comes from.. that's right, France, specifically from the Côtes-du-Rhône region. admittedly, I don't know much about this yeast other than what I've read. but, it's another popular wine/mead yeast, that has a  published tolerance of 14%ABV, with good flocculation, but should be used with temperature controlled fermentation on the lower end of the range from 15° to 20°C (59° to 68°F), and can leave behind Citrus & 'Tropical fruit' Esters. in Mead D47 requires careful attention to yeast-nutrients, and specifically YAN or Yeast-Assimilable-Nitrogen (to borrow terms from /u/balathustrius edit: read his white paper on yeast nutrition here )"

I have been fermenting the mead at 72 degrees, not knowing that it should be in a lower temp range. It's fermenting okay, but should I be worried about how this will affect flavor? Unfortunately I don't have a way to bring the temp down lower as I don't have temp controlled fermentation...yet."
mead,38uj2i,new-Baltimoreon,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:41:47 2015 UTC,"I haven't used D-47 personally, so maybe someone will be able to chime in with first hand knowledge, but...  in general, fermentation temperatures on the higher end (or slightly above) of a yeast's published ""optimal"" temperature range is not the end of the world, it may cause some Fusel alcohol flavors, but those will usually age out if you give it time.    depending on your recipe, and final gravity, it may not even be an issue, as fusels can be covered by residual sweetness, and other flavors such as fruit tartness.   72 is probably fine, especially since this is your first mead you can use this as your bench mark for future batches, by no means is your batch going to be damaged, just give it as much time after bottling as you have the patience for (if you're anything like me, you probably won't have enough to make it until your second batch is ready for bottling... pro-tip: mead is delicious, start your second batch soon).  in the future, you can easily drop the relative temperature of your fermenter by making a swamp-cooler: basically wrap your fermenter in a T-shirt or towel, and partially submerge the bottom of the fermenter in water in such a way that water will wick up the T-shirt. water will evaporate from the cloth and lower the temperature as it changes phase (liquid to vapor), you can accentuate this temperature drop by placing a fan so that the airflow is directed at the T-shirt to accelerate the evaporation."
mead,38uj2i,new-Baltimoreon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:41:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the detailed and structured answer. I thought the yeast was mostly for making the alcohol, but it appears the flavor is affected in a huge way as well.  I'll definitely look into the different types of strains :)"

You can also take the top off of a 3 piece airlock, remove the cap that floats/bubbles, and attach tubing over that stem.  When the crisis has passed go back to an airlock.  edit: if that isn't an option then I would probably take the airlock off a few times a day and re-sanitize it and replace it.

If I ever begin brewing large scale it seems like it would be a relevant concern.  Additionally, I've seen people here claim that sulfite has been used as far back as ancient Romans, but cannot find a source for this. Can someone direct me to some background on this?"
mead,38lq6w,honor_t_goat,3,Fri Jun 5 01:03:24 2015 UTC,"If it seems like it's fermenting (bubbly/fizzy) but there is no airlock activity I'd suspect a bad seal on the fermenter lid or on the airlock stopper, etc.    I doubt lack of nutrients is it, raisins should get it going.  And nutrients would be more to prevent stressed yeast in a traditional, not a outright requirement to ferment.  edit : another case where hydrometers come in handy.  If it's fermenting that reading is going to be changing, regardless of what the airlock does or doesn't do.  Or #4.  The temp of the rehydrated yeast and the must are not supposed to differ by more than 10C or you can potentially shock or kill the yeast.  edit 2: by the way with 12.5 lbs of honey EC-1118 is going to absolutely devour that and come back for more.  EC-1118 is good for 18-20% and 12.5 lbs of honey is only about 12.3% worth of sugar."
mead,38lq6w,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:10:57 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention it, even when the lid is on I can get the same yeasty/boozy smell around the rim of the bucket. That definitely could be it.  So what would a leaky seal mean for fermentation? Will finishing the primary in this bucket probably be fine, or would it be worth trying to find a different lid?  Also, I appreciate that you've taken time to answer both of my questions so far. It seems like this sub tends to be pretty friendly and helpful."
mead,38lq6w,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,2,Fri Jun 5 02:37:44 2015 UTC,"It won't hurt anything really.  During fermentation there is so much co2 being produced that it's inhospitable to most spoilage organisms.  Some people ferment in an open bucket with a towel or cloth draped over it.  I wouldn't go that far but it doesn't matter if it's leaking as long as it's fermenting.  After a week or two, be more concerned about introducing oxygen unnecessarily.  It also hurts nothing to take the lid off now and try to re-seal it better."
mead,38lq6w,new-Baltimoreon,3,Fri Jun 5 03:26:55 2015 UTC,"it's in a bucket, they're notorious for not sealing air-tight. as /u/myotherbrotherdarryl says, get a hydrometer, thet tell you so much about what's going on, and they're cheap!"
mead,38lq6w,new-Baltimoreon,2,Fri Jun 5 01:39:10 2015 UTC,"I have a hydrometer and have tried it out a bit. I didn't get an accurate temperature reading when I took the initial gravity for this batch, so the calibration might be a little off, but it was somewhere between 1.089 and 1.093 (right near that 12.3% mark that /u/myotherbrotherdarryl mentioned).  How often do you think I should be taking hydrometer readings?"
mead,38lq6w,tempuratime,2,Fri Jun 5 02:46:43 2015 UTC,"How often do you think I should be taking hydrometer readings?   any time you are curious as to what the mead is doing. I don't worry about the temtemperature too much, as long as it's roughly room temp and not artificially hot or cold, you should be within a couple points. (and that's assuming that yours is calibrated to your water = 1.000 in the first place). the biggest things you will want to look for are your original gravity (starting point before adding the yeast), and the rate of change in the readings (first couple weeks I tend to get measurments every couple days, and then 1/week, then 1/month'ish) until you get the same reading three times in a row... That's your FG or final gravity, and that lets you know how much of your starting potential has been converted to alcohol."
mead,38jxvt,KnightofBaldMt,6,Thu Jun 4 18:43:21 2015 UTC,"I probably wouldn't consider (what it appears you are) emptying 3 gallons of bottles, stabilising, back sweetening and then rebottling.  The risk to all of that 2 year old mead is too great - infection, loss of clarity, oxidation .....  I would consider doing it at a per bottle basis as you open it for consumption"
mead,38jxvt,MarsColonist,5,Thu Jun 4 21:20:33 2015 UTC,"Do you know the equation for backsweetening?  Measure the gravity with a hydrometer. Lets say its .996 (dry). Lets say you want it at semisweet (1.012).  1.012-.996 = 0.016, or 16 gravity points.  35 pts/lb/gal for honey  16/35 * volume you want to backsweeten (5gal) = 2.28 lbs of honey (basically 1kg of honey)  Are you stabilizing? For 5 gal, 1/4 tsp K-Meta, and 1 TBSP K-sorbate. Dissolve in a small amount of hot water. You cannot bottle carbonate if you use Ksorbate."
mead,38jxvt,Hyperluminary,4,Thu Jun 4 20:27:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, your best bet is to sweeten to taste with a simple syrup at the time of drinking, if you already have it bottled.  Don't risk infection by re-bottling, just add a bit of sweetness to taste when you pour a glass."
mead,38jxvt,JonasTorgersen,3,Thu Jun 4 21:27:25 2015 UTC,"When you age a mead, it becomes slightly sweeter. As you want to backsweeten, the rule of thumb to keep in mind is that honey has a ppg of 35. One pound of honey in one gallon will raise the gravity by 35 points. What was your recipe, gravity, and what chemicals did you add?  If you didn't, you'll want to add potassium sorbate. This will inhibit the yeast from multiplying, and thus a renewed fermentation. A sweet mead will have a final gravity of >1.025, and a medium sweet mead will have a final gravity of 1.010-1.025. Add your desired amount of honey a few days after adding ksorb and stir until dissolved. Keep in mind that adding honey will make your mead cloudy again. This will settle out.  After this, I'd give it a month of two for the flavors to blend anew. It'd be perfectly drinkable right from the get-go, but you might be able to tell that this is mead with added honey, instead of a sweet mead."
mead,38jflf,Aurimass,7,Thu Jun 4 16:55:30 2015 UTC,"If your OG was 1.111 and it's now 1.000 and you used 71B, it's probably done.  1.111 -> 1.000 is about 14.9%.  71B is capable of higher and you did stagger nutrients, but then again it's rated for 14%.  So if you add more honey it may ferment a little more or it may not.  If you like how it tastes then wait a few weeks or months, let it clear, bottle.    If it's too dry/tart for your taste add some honey, maybe 1/5 to 1/4 lb (edit: was thinking of a 1 gallon batch) 1 lb to get it up around 1.010 maybe 1.008.  Or backsweeten to your taste.  If you do this without stabilizing it may ferment a little more and you might have to repeat.  edit:  1lb honey in 1 gallon is around .038, so in 5 gallons it'll add about .007-.008.  Or you can stabilize with 1 crushed campden tablet (potassium metabisulfite) per gallon and 1/2 tsp potassium sorbate per gallon.  This should prevent any more fermentation. Then backsweeten, wait a while for it to clear again.  Careful of judgements about taste this early in the game, almost all mead tastes pretty crappy until the 3 month mark or more.  edit:  if I was you I'd rack (transfer) it off the yeast into a sanitized fermenter, do nothing more until about mid to late August.  See how it tastes then, and decide amongst the options above. Start another batch in the meantime."
mead,38jflf,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,2,Thu Jun 4 17:14:04 2015 UTC,Great advice /u/myotherbrotherdarryl This is what I would've offered.
mead,38jflf,tempuratime,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:02:55 2015 UTC,"I did the same recipe for my first mead.  Since it is never told you during the steps, this will take a long time to come out tasty.  I did 71B, 15.5lbs honey, 4 gals water.  I am 2 months post pitch on mine and I had to add more honey a week ago.  This is not a fast mead.  Which I really wish would have been included in the instructions.  You just assume, first easy mead should be a fast one to get people hooked on it.  Nope, traditional needs time.  You find that out as you read more.  First starter meads should be more like JAOM, MAOM or BOMMs.  Look those up.  But to answer your question.  Yes everything is fine.  If you are happy with around a 15% ABV (higher ABV will require more aging time) then you should rack it into a 5 gal carboy.  Take a taste and try to focus on the sweetness of it, nothing else.  If it is a dry/sweet as you want your mead to be then leave it alone.  If you want it sweeter you need to use Potassium Metabisulfite and Potassium Sorbate to stabilize so that you can add more honey/sweeteners."
mead,38gf1a,Snugglejitsu,3,Thu Jun 4 01:10:11 2015 UTC,Wow!  Was this just time or were additions needed for this?

mead,38gf62,pwnslinger,2,Thu Jun 4 01:10:53 2015 UTC,"I dont know this recipe (BOMM) but does it call for 1388 yeast? That yeast is has a pretty distinct peppery phenolic character.  Id go with 3787 (Trappist High Gravity) which is more fruity esters... I suppose thats what you mean by ""super clean"" when talking about clean flavor profiles from Belgian yeast strains.  If you want clean (read:neutral) flavor, WLP001 (Chico) is about as clean as it gets.  Ive found that wine yeast flavor profiles are much more similar to each other than the diversity of beer yeast profiles; you use a Belgian beer yeast, expect Belgian character.  How clear was it? Slight haze will still be a lot of yeast in there, and they put up a ""bite"" until they are full degassed of CO2.  Heres a nice article on Belgian yeast profiles  Apparently, it does call for 1388"

Had no issues with the 1388, and my first batches were aged on top of vanilla beans and oak chips, so any beer taste would have really conflicted. My first melomel with the recipe will be ready this week, so I'll come back and see if I have the same issues..."
mead,38gf62,maximumtaco,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:36:52 2015 UTC,"How long did you primary, secondary, and let it rest in the bottle? What temp did you ferment at?  Thanks!"
mead,38gf62,hasnonaim,2,Tue Jul 7 14:07:10 2015 UTC,"I fermented at room temperature in my basement, around 68-70 degrees usually. I think primary was done in about two weeks, then I let it sit in secondary with some oak and a sliced vanilla bean for another four weeks or so. Once it was totally stable and finished fermenting I tried it two ways. My first batch I added potassium sorbate and potassium metabisulfite, then back sweetened to taste, let it rest a few days, then fined it with kieselsol and chitosan. I did another batch where i used step feeding instead of sorbate/etc. which worked well, but because I over sweetened it i had to let it sit for a few months before it cleaned up. Both batches were delicious at bottling, no additional resting or anything was needed.  You might look at your starter, just one smack pack without a starter for a 5 gallon batch isn't a lot, especially in a challenging growth medium like honey. You can do a two or three day starter by making a liter or so of honey must (maybe 1.03, like a quarter cup of honey or so) with go ferm or a bit of dap, put it in a large, sanitized tupperware type container and put the lid on very loosely. Shake it up a few times a day and when you're ready just dump the whole thing into your must. That should get it a faster and less stressed start, should ease back on those esters and off flavours for next time.  Good luck :-)"
mead,38eoop,Snugglejitsu,2,Wed Jun 3 18:44:39 2015 UTC,"lactose provides the same sweetness as honey (35 pts/lb/gal) When I back with lactose, I ususally do half lactose and half honey.  Also, lactose is a PITA to get to dissolve.  Do you know the equation for backsweetening?  Measure the gravity with a hydrometer. Lets say its .996 (dry). Lets say you want it at semisweet (1.012).  1.012-.996 = 0.016, or 16 gravity points.  35 pts/lb/gal for honey (and lactose)  16/35 * volume you want to backsweeten (5gal) = 2.28 lbs of honey (basically 1kg of honey)  Are you stabilizing?

mead,38eoop,MarsColonist,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:54:00 2015 UTC,"Here is the info on my recipes.     My JAOM was a bit modified. 15 pounds honey, water filled to 5 gallon volume.

I did a 5 gallon batch, how many pounds of Lactose would I be looking at?  Also, what is the process? should i take a sample off the mango, warm it up and dissolve the lactose, then reincorporate it to the rest of the batch in the bottling bucket?"
mead,38eoop,MarsColonist,2,Wed Jun 3 23:23:47 2015 UTC,"you might do bench trials ... add til its sweetened to your taste then check the gravity.

You could just use a small amount of water (12oz or so) to dissolve it then just add it."
mead,38eoop,MarsColonist,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:30:34 2015 UTC,"With the jaom, its crystal clear with zero lees. Is that indicating that virtually all the yeast is gone and risk of refermenting is minimal?"
mead,38eoop,MarsColonist,2,Thu Jun 4 11:48:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe. Take a very strong light (Maglight or bright LED flashlight) and shine it through the side of the carboy/jug. Can you see the beam (light scatter)? If so, its not really ""crystal"". (Although, it looks pretty damn clear) You also stated its ""CHEMICALLY STABILIZED"". What exactly did you add to stabilize it? If you added Ksorbate at that clarity, it isnt going to come back.. if you only added KMeta, it still might pop back up (depending on temperature, pH and Delle units). To fully stabilize it, you need to use both Ksorbate and Kmeta, and it should be after its ""clear"" (yours certainly look clear enough to have a low cell count).  Delle units are way to determine whether yeast have a real stopping point; Delle Unit = (4.5 x % alcohol ) + sugar % RS. If the number is 65 or >, restarting the fermentation is difficult.  If the right combination of residual sugar (which is kind of hard to determine) and the ABV is high enough, it would be very difficult for yeast to restart."
mead,38eoop,MarsColonist,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:25:50 2015 UTC,how should I mix this back into the mead?  Dissolve the lactose outside of the bottling bucket? and just stir it in?  Are there any videos or guides showing this process?
mead,38eoop,Uniquitous,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:25:16 2015 UTC,"Id say just put it in, rack on top of that, mix the hell out of it then add the KMeta afterward to pick up any oxygen you mixed in there.

mead,38eoop,Uniquitous,2,Sat Jun 6 02:39:51 2015 UTC,Considering the mango-ness of this batch I don't really care about clarity... actually I want it to look like orange juice considering the mouth feel and sweetness I'm going for.
mead,38eoop,Ehxdi,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:43:01 2015 UTC,"I made a batch of mango habanero too!

mead,38eoop,Uniquitous,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:09:29 2015 UTC,The yeast was at its tolerance.
mead,38eoop,Uniquitous,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:50:06 2015 UTC,"Ok, but has it stopped the fermenting - or does it still bubble ? I ask because I have a 10% Tolerance yeast currently going past 14%, and tolerance is just a guideline, isn't it ?"
mead,38eoop,StormBeforeDawn,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:56:21 2015 UTC,"There are absolutely no bubbles, and the mead is clear. I should note that out of the 30 or so longnecks yielded, I only have 6 left at this point. If something was going to happen, it would have by now.   Notwithstanding, longnecks would be a good choice for a sparkler due to their high pressure tolerance. But there has been no sign of reactivated fermentation or undue pressure whenever one has been opened."
mead,38bp52,dokwilson74,5,Wed Jun 3 04:32:42 2015 UTC,"Not really. You could try acid to counter the bitter, but I wouldn't try anything till about 6 months. It MAY age out, but that sort of flavor isn't the hot booze feel that goes away easily."
mead,38bp52,StormBeforeDawn,2,Wed Jun 3 05:10:51 2015 UTC,"Or potentially a bit more honey depending on the finished gravity. If it's tannic, it'll either need acidity, sweetness (honey), or both. I second the idea of waiting to make that call, though."

mead,38bp52,bailtail,2,Wed Jun 3 05:20:18 2015 UTC,"You're assuming it's an off-flavor when that may not be the case. It's possible, if not probable, that that bitter/tartness is just a flavor imbalance. You want to balance sweetness, astringency (tannins), and acidity. The bitterness/tartness could either point to a balance that favors tannins and/or acidity. Acidity generally won't fade with age, but tannins can mellow out. That's why dry red wines require lengthy aging periods. Give it more time to see what direction it goes then make a decision what course to take. Gravity readings would helpful in determining if a lack of sweetness is playing a major role."
mead,38bp52,Moonpi314,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:35:02 2015 UTC,"So if it does lean towards being to acidic, could I throw some more sugar or honey in?

I actually had to throw about 15% of them out after the skins started splitting and I noticed a small amount of mold. Ended up with ~16 lbs of peeled banana in the fermentor. Added 3 grade A Madagascar vanilla beans, 1.5 nutmegs freshly ground, and 1.85 oz of cinnamon sticks.   Ended up overdiluting my must with water and undershot my target OG, it started at 1.120 though, which I was ok with.

I picked up the BBFT from Kuhnhenn this year and it really made me want to try to make my own homebrew version. But, I didn't want to just make a clone, I wanted to make it my own.  Alongside the banana mead here I also made a maple wine, and the plan is to blend the two wines together once they finish, and instead of doing bourbon barrel aging, I have picked up some samples of maple wood, charred them, and have them soaking in high quality dark rum.   In the end I want my wine to be more profoundly banana, maple, and rum like. Something reminiscent of the bread pudding my grandmother used to make.

mead,387qh1,iFenx,2,Tue Jun 2 17:16:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not worried about it. I am not looking to bottle this thing in a month, and if it takes me two years to complete then so be it. I've heard some say banana wines clear faster if you include the skins, but I believe I'll be just fine. If all else fails I'll use an agent to clear it up. no biggie."
mead,387qh1,maximumtaco,2,Tue Jun 2 17:24:59 2015 UTC,"I made a banana wine a while ago, and it took under six months to clear.  I've heard that banana wines benefit greatly from age.  From undrinkable to delicious in 1-1.5 years.  2 years sounds like a good timeframe for a banana mead!"
mead,387qh1,cryospam,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:10:13 2015 UTC,Exactly this. I've got a batch almost three years old now and I wish I waited this long to open all those bottles...
mead,387qh1,cryospam,2,Tue Jun 2 18:54:27 2015 UTC,"I did a pretty low gravity banana wine (thinking 1.080, but not positive) and that baby cleared like no one's business."

mead,387qh1,cryospam,2,Wed Jun 3 14:39:31 2015 UTC,"You might be able to get a more subtle version of the banana flavour by fermenting with wyeast 1388 at a warm temperature. I use that yeast for my usual base mead recipe (BOMM), and last year I made a banana bread/holiday spice beer using a warm ferment. Hope it turns out well!"
mead,387qh1,therealjims,2,Tue Jun 2 19:26:27 2015 UTC,"I am curious how well the belgian yeast notes of banana/clove come through when fermenting a mead must as opposed to a beer wort, as some have noted that there are noticeable differences. I certainly want to play with some of those strains eventually and see what they can do, but for this project I am going for anything but subtle ;)"
mead,387qh1,I_ABUSED_YOUR_CHAIR,2,Tue Jun 2 19:35:57 2015 UTC,"Ahh I wish you had posted before.  In order to get the full effect of the banana smell & flavor, you have to use the skins too, otherwise it will be lacking!  Puree the shit out of them, and let it ferment for a while (I did 6 weeks) and then hit with SuperKleer and Bentonite and rack to secondary after it settles."
mead,387qh1,therealjims,3,Tue Jun 2 19:51:33 2015 UTC,"so I did a lot of internet research on this before I put it together and it seemed like a lot of people had success with bananas if they let them go overripe before using them. At first I wanted to use the skins, but after thinking it over, I didn't want to deal with all of the solids and potential bacterial growth on them. I still have 12# more of bananas to throw in once primary fermentation settles down, but if the mead still lacks banana flavor/aroma after all of that then next time I'll certainly try it out with the skins."
mead,387qh1,m4050m3,3,Tue Jun 2 20:00:26 2015 UTC,"I have done a few of them before.  The solution is to boil the bananas initially to kill anything growing on them.  It also helps to soften the skins for pureeing.    Right now I've got like 12 gallons of a blended batch that is almost ready to bottle, it's a dry Bochet that finished about 9% and super high abv sweet banana (22% and almost viscous) blended together after hitting it with sorbate and sulfite.    After blending they clouded right up so I let it sit for 6 months and then hit it with SuperKleer and Bentonite (I didn't clear the banana mead in primary because I knew I was blending).   I think I'm going to bottle it in July."
mead,387qh1,Moonpi314,2,Tue Jun 2 23:42:48 2015 UTC,Instead of letting them get ripe or maybe after they have gotten ripe it would be a good idea to freeze and then thaw the bananas.    Freezing the bananas causes the ice crystals to break down the cell walls in the banana causing them to turn to mush on their own.    I saw this on a good eats episode about bananas i'm assuming it would be good for mead too.
mead,387qh1,m4050m3,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:57:36 2015 UTC,"yeah I thought about doing that but I just don't have any room in my freezer :(. They were pretty mushy though, and blended easily with the must, so it wasn't really a problem."

For a long time now I've felt that ale yeasts should work just as well as wine yeasts as long as you are using proper nutrition, so I would love to see some data that validates my opinion!  One thing that might be interesting to consider is saving a few of the samples and re-running the taste testing with the judges again in a year to see how well they have aged."
mead,388kdh,Bunsomel,2,Tue Jun 2 17:19:52 2015 UTC,"I have used WLP001 and WLP090, both of those worked very well for me.  One yeast I would like to see included would be a Kolsch yeast. I made a cider once with Kolsch yeast and got some very tasty esters that really complemented the apple flavor.  I am also curious about brett.  I have a brett b mead going now, but it is sloooow to finish and very clean tasting so far."
mead,388kdh,jaggamuffin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:44:13 2015 UTC,"Kolsch yeast was done on a basic brewing radio podcast with some other beer yeasts.  It didn't work well.  Basic consensus from that seemed to be use high alchy yeast strains, light style yeasts just can't handle toe yravity"

The yeasts you listed are good by me, but I'd also like to see a brettanomyces listed. I'd be intrigued to see if mead really is too acidic for proper brett growth.  I loved that wine yeast experiment, and I'm really looking forward to this. Good luck!"
mead,388kdh,kharedryl,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:47:37 2015 UTC,"I loved your other yeast experiment and will eagerly await this one.  My only yeast suggestion is Nottingham as it is my (and other locals who I talk to) go to yeast for cider, but this might be considered a duplicate of WLP007. That or WLP830 (German Lager) to see if it will leave behind extra honey flavors since it's used for Oktoberfest and other malt forward beers.  PS: Can I get a pdf copy of the tastings grid (page 64-65 of the Mar/Apr 2015 issue) that had the yeast type down the left and the taster across the top, with their notes on each mead in each square? Photocopying is poor and I can't get a good grab in the online version. I need this for my recipe book and don't want to separate it from the magazine."
mead,388kdh,KEM10,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:03:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip on the Nottingham yeast for cider. I'll be doing my first batch soon, and I've been wondering what kind of yeast to use."
mead,388kdh,kharedryl,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:49:19 2015 UTC,"One thing that has always bothered me when it comes to yeast comparison studies is the resulting beverage gets treated equal whether it finishes at 1.03 or .990. To me, you just can't judge the merits of a yeast if they done have similar levels of residual sugar. After all, if you have a mead go bone-dry on a typical batch, you usually will backsweeten to some degree.   I realize there isn't an easy solution to this issue, but figured I'd throw in my two cents. Something to think about."
mead,388kdh,bailtail,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:49:22 2015 UTC,"Isn't the tolerance of the yeast part of the equation? When I'm picking out my yeast I have my final product in mind, and I adjust my selection so that I can reasonably ensure I get an adequate final gravity.  Which, naturally, did not at all occur with my recent show mead. I wanted something on the high end of semi-sweet, and I got a mostly dry mead. Oh well."
mead,388kdh,kharedryl,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:52:30 2015 UTC,"That's kind of what I'm getting at. It would be easy to account for if yeast tolerances were all +/-0.5% of the published value, but that is unfortunately not the case. I just posted a couple weeks back about a batch I have going with Wyeast 4184 Sweet Mead (11%) that was at 18+% (it's still going and is likely in the 19.5-20% range by now). Yes, that's a super-extreme case, but it speaks to predictability."
mead,388kdh,bailtail,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:31:42 2015 UTC,I agree bailtail- it's tough to compare yeast performance when there's different levels of residual sugar. That's why I chose the yeasts I did- they should all be able to ferment dry to around 1.0 if I start with an OG of 1.090. At least according to the previous meads I've done with yeasts that have a similar alcohol tolerance.
mead,388w85,Esplodies,5,Tue Jun 2 17:46:52 2015 UTC,"The first mead I ever made was a strawberry-banana-mango mead and I have come to love it! When it was young there was not much strawberry flavor, but now that it has aged a bit the strawberry and especially the banana come in quite strong. The mango still seems faint at best.  anywho, for 5 gallons I used ~21# clover honey, 16# strawberry, 8# banana, and 8# mango. It took about 6 months to clear, and ended up with a higher FG than I would have wanted. If I were to re-do it, I would go 18-20# honey, 20#+ strawberry and 10#+ banana. I'd shoot for a FG around 1.020-1.030. My first wine came out a little too soft for me, so you might want to consider adding acid blend to give it a nice little tartness. I think it's totally doable in your time frame, just don't bottle early like I did and have a 1/2"" of lees at the bottom of every bottle!"

On the left is a 20% show mead, 2/3 palmetto honey, 1/3 summer berry (local proprietary blend).  It's only a few months old, and it definitely needs some age.

I used a filter I had in my molecular bio research lab that would normally be used to filter sediment from media (font worry it was a new one we had just gotten and was thoroughly cleaned), very little should have gotten through it. Didn't have the equipment for a gravity reading so I took a small sample of it in to my lab and used equipment there to calculate abv (well, I borrowed the equipment from the organic research lab).

mead,384qkn,bailtail,3,Mon Jun 1 21:41:42 2015 UTC,"At two months without using a clarifying agent, there could have been quite a bit of yeast still in suspension. One of the many properties in which brewing-specific yeasts excel over baking yeast is flocculence, the degree to which yeast stick to one another and stay stuck together. Flocculation is generally responsible for yeast falling out of suspension. Because baking yeast is poor at this, the chances you bottled a bunch of yeast with your mead are pretty high. Yes, you filtered, but you need to filter at a ""sterile"" level if you want to remove yeast."
mead,384qkn,MarsColonist,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:13:45 2015 UTC,used equipment there to calculate abv   how exactly did you calc the ABV?  I find it really hard to believe you hit 15% ABV with bread yeast.

It's all about the ingredients you use. Our Schezuan Chili Dark Chocolate Braggot was ""drinkable"" at 6 months, but a bit too hot spicewise, it took about another year for it to ease off and be more sessionable."
mead,3839x9,scotchlover,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:14:40 2015 UTC,My advice would be to make a tincture and wait to add it til right before bottling. Take a small amount of the mead and add measured drops of the tinctures to it til you get something you want to drink.   I do one with cacao nibs and vodka (same with vanilla beans as well). Get something that has been heavily distilled and is rocking at least 80 proof. I did about 50 grams of cacao nibs and 200 grams of vodka and it smells great. For the peanut butter I'd just add the pb2 in straight powder form but I have no recommendations on how much to add
mead,3839x9,MarsColonist,3,Mon Jun 1 20:15:20 2015 UTC,Haven't done a Mead but have brewed a chocolate peanut butter oatmeal stout. My advice is to use PB2 powdered peanut butter and chocolate nibs. It turned out well and the oil was minimal because of the PB2. My only mistake was using a carboy. Cleaning would have been a lot easier had I used a bucket.

Get some chocolate malt, use baker's cocoa in the aroma stage, and I'm sure there's some way to use peanuts (maybe in addition to the chocolate malt as a partial mash)."
mead,383j2r,Gyges_of_Lydia,2,Mon Jun 1 16:24:59 2015 UTC,"Carbonation absolutely helps. It brings some sharpness that is needed. Also, try about 0.2g/L of tartaric acid  1.002 is dry and .992 is bone dry.  The flavor profile will be much more honey forward if SG > 1.010"

mead,383j2r,Waldamos,2,Tue Jun 2 02:21:09 2015 UTC,"I would call that semi sweet. Depends on the balance (alcohol vs acidity vs tannin vs sweetness).  I dont usually call it ""sweet"" until about 1.025, but again, its subjective and depends on other factors."
mead,383j2r,MarsColonist,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:43:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed that it is all about balance. When it comes to hydromels, I've found that the typical sweetness gravity category scale goes out the window."

A similarly light-handed approach with spices, oak, acids, tannins, etc. can make a all the difference. I'll second others' recommendations to carbonate. IMO, that's practically a necessity for hydromels."
mead,383j2r,bailtail,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:59:28 2015 UTC,"The honey flavors are going to be light and delicate in hydromel varieties, to the point of being nearly imperceptible when you use a light honey like clover."

mead,383j2r,kharedryl,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:05:14 2015 UTC,"Bochet hydromel?  Agreed on the carbonation, and I REALLY agree with acidity. Even some tannins would do it well. If you're cool with it stopping fermentation would help.  Really, everything MarsColonist said. But I'd also argue for small amounts of tannins. Berries do hydromels well, but a hydromel bitter apple cyser also sounds delish."
mead,383j2r,MarsColonist,2,Tue Jun 2 01:47:03 2015 UTC,"My plan was to treat it like I would a cider. I would add additional sugars before bottling, and pasteurize (stovetop) after a couple days to keep some sweetness and prevent bottle bombs.  Sounds like I should add acid/ tannins first though."
mead,382wqk,piperson,3,Mon Jun 1 13:45:48 2015 UTC,"On my last cherry batch I had 10 lbs of cherries in primary and most of the flavor got eaten by the Lalvin 71b strain. The color was nice and I back sweetened with cherry juice so it's good so far.   I'm working on a batch right now where I instead ferment just the honey to get it up to about 13% abv so that it still has a little ways to go before hitting the 71b tolerance, then rack it onto cherries and probably leave it there for a month to finish out before racking into a carboy for bulk aging.  And now that I'm thinking about it, that first batch also fermented silly fast and I think that put in some off flavors. Those settled out in a few months, but fermenting with just the honey upfront should give me better control over how fast it ferments."
mead,382wqk,shadesfox,2,Mon Jun 1 14:27:10 2015 UTC,"71b is a yeast that isn't known for leaving much in fruit flavors behind.  If you are going to use the 71b, I would always recommend adding the fruit in the secondary, and then doing taste tests to make sure that the fruit flavor dosen't get overpowering.  Once a week is usually pretty good, until you start getting close to what you are wanting, and then maybe every other day or so, and then rack off the fruit/remove it out (if you are using a bag or such to hold it in)."
mead,382wqk,Banluil,2,Mon Jun 1 21:57:41 2015 UTC,"My experience and most of what I've read indicates the exact opposite. As far as wine yeast go, 71B is one of the better strains when it comes to preservation of fruit notes."
mead,382wqk,bailtail,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:39:29 2015 UTC,"I've had the exact opposite, don't get me wrong, 71b is my workhorse and default yeast type, and I LOVE it, but anytime I use it and use fruit, it completely kills the flavor of them in the primary."
mead,382wqk,Banluil,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:10:50 2015 UTC,"More so than other similar ABV meads? Because all yeasts will do that to a degree, and the more sugars that are converted, the less the fruit profile is likely to come through."
mead,382wqk,bailtail,3,Tue Jun 2 14:11:02 2015 UTC,"What kind of plums are they?  I would wash and halve the plums, adding 25% of the pits back to the recipe (you will also get tannin from the skins of the plums - mine didn't have pits because that is illegal commercially, and it was awesome without).  And I would use 6#+ per gallon in primary - you won't get the plum flavor you want with 6# total.  I hate cloves so if it were up to me I would skip that.  The pectic enzyme isn't a terrible idea, but still I would plan on using a fining agent.  By my calculations, your mead may end up around 9% abv and quite dry (the alcohol tolerance of D47 is 14%) - is this the kind of mead you want?  It may have little to no honey character at that FG.  With your plums and 9% abv, I would also plan on using some potassium metabisulfite."

mead,382wqk,bailtail,2,Tue Jun 2 14:18:46 2015 UTC,I've read on here that the fruit taste gets eaten by the yeast if it's in primary and to actually put the fruit in secondary.
mead,382wqk,Creid90,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:15:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I heard that too but it's up for debate. Ideally I'd make two batches and find out. We'll see.
mead,382wqk,Banluil,2,Mon Jun 1 14:25:42 2015 UTC,"It all depends on what strain of yeast you are using.  With the d47, it has a lower alcohol tolerance, so it is generally a bit nicer on fruit taste."
mead,382wqk,naudir,2,Mon Jun 1 21:58:30 2015 UTC,"i've made jack keller's plum wine and his recipe calls for 6 pounds of plums per 1 gallon. mine is 5 months old right now, and i was hoping it would have more plum character than it currently does so i will probably end up adding more plums in secondary.   it really depends on how flavorful your particular plums are, but i'd recommend adding way more than the 6 pounds per 5 gallons you're planning unless you want a very mild flavor."
mead,382wqk,naudir,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:31:02 2015 UTC,"That's great advise. Thanks.   The plums are from a tree in my yard. They are not the sweetest, most flavorful plums ever. I'm not sure how it will come out, but it should be fun in any case. Maybe I should experiment with 1 gallon batches.   Even with the skins and pit, do you think the grape tannin is necessary?"
mead,382wqk,Moonpi314,2,Mon Jun 1 17:30:30 2015 UTC,"you can add powdered tannin at any point (same with acid blend), so if you want you can let your mead age and add tannin/acid to taste later on."

mead,382wqk,nenanen,2,Wed Jun 3 14:21:27 2015 UTC,"Also, just to throw it out there, if you are looking for a sweeter mead, you may want to look at going with a bit more honey, unless you are planning on halting the fermentation at a specific FG.  But, then again, you ARE using d47, which does have a lower stated alcohol tolerance, but has been known to go past that in certain circumstances.  Just be sure to keep an eye on it, or you may end up with a drier mead than you are looking for."
mead,382wqk,JTehFreakS,2,Mon Jun 1 21:55:49 2015 UTC,"I'd personally take 3.5lb of honey and all of those plums and make a 1 gallon batch out of it.  I'd also pit the plums and run them through the blender first, or steam juice them.  source: on my 5th year of ~20g of plum honey wine per year"
mead,382wqk,Moonpi314,2,Mon Jun 1 23:45:21 2015 UTC,"I bottled a red plum mead not too long ago.  Did you get the plums from a store, or did you harvest them yourself?  If you picked them yourself and got them green to ripen in the house, make sure they're good and ripe before you add them in, otherwise you're looking at some super sour stuff that you'll have to backsweeten a good ways to balance out the acidity.    One thing you'll want to do is put your plums in a nylon mesh bag so you won't have to deal with the pulp; trust me on this, I lost almost half of a batch to that mess..  Add the fruit, in its bag, to another large bucket and them rack your mead over them, when it's the plums have sat on the mead for as long as you want them to, all you have to do is pull out the bag and give it a good squeeze to get out as much liquid that's still in the bag, all you'll have left is some light pulp, similar to what you'll find in orange juice.  I used 10 pounds of plums in secondary, and the plum character comes through quite well, and it isn't overpowering either."

mead,383m28,hobbeswasright_,3,Mon Jun 1 16:44:28 2015 UTC,"i would suggest you try something other than peach. It takes a huge quantity of peaches for any flavor to come out, and it takes a long time for that to happen."

mead,383m28,BoogerTom,2,Mon Jun 1 18:55:16 2015 UTC,"I did 3 pounds per gallon: 5 in primary, 5 x 2 additions in secondary over a long period. Total honey was fairly light, somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 lbs/5 gallons. Fruit was pureed, with pectic enzyme to break the flesh down. After about 5 months in the bottle, it had virtually no recognizable peach flavor. What I had in my glass was so dull I tried doping it with (1) almond extract (2) amaretto and (3) peach schnapps. Nothing helped.   I'm going to see how it is after a year in the bottle (time is the friend of all meads) but from what I've read peaches, along wih blueberries, are notorious for producing disappointing results at least in the 18 month timespan.  Now cherries, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, elderberries...That's another story.  Edit: One thing I hadn't thought about was the variety and ripeness of the peaches. Maybe if they're super-ripe or an heirloom variety the results might be better. Good luck & report back!"

mead,37yxmx,drewbage1847,1 point,Sun May 31 17:09:49 2015 UTC,No idea. This one definitely had bugs. The sourness was quite potent.
mead,37yxmx,JohnDrinksMead,2,Tue Jun 2 15:20:26 2015 UTC,Is is a sweeter mead that they turned sour? I could see a sweet and sour combo being really good together. I once mixed a sweet fermented agave batch with a sour batch of cider and it came out pretty decent.

mead,37xh7v,dbreidsbmw,1 point,Sun May 31 05:28:33 2015 UTC,Wouldn't getting the honey that hot destroy the flavor?
mead,37xh7v,BloodBlight,2,Sun May 31 05:38:45 2015 UTC,"Well caramelizing killed the basic flavor or more delegate flavors but adds a caramel toffee and even a marshmallow flavor depending on how long your heat it. If you burn it, usually its a burnt marshmallow taste. So slow cooking on a semi reasonable heat... Maybe a crock pot of you knew wat temperature it cooked at .. But you can look up bochet recipes here on r/mead, plenty. Around"
mead,37xh7v,bailtail,2,Sun May 31 05:49:48 2015 UTC,"Why would you add water before caramelization? Seems like that's a step backwards.   Adding water first instead of just caramelizing the honey and then adding water will just cause a lot of the water to evaporate, waste energy, and take a lot of unnecessary time (heating up, caramelization process, cooling to pitch-able temp, etc.) If you're looking to control the degree of caramelization, that is easily achieved with heating temp and heat exposure time."

mead,37vqa2,metronos,3,Sat May 30 20:15:46 2015 UTC,OG of 1.02? That doesn't sound right...
mead,37vqa2,i_forget_my_userids,1 point,Sat May 30 21:01:34 2015 UTC,So just double checked. It is 1.02. Why does that seem wrong?
mead,37vqa2,i_forget_my_userids,3,Sun May 31 03:37:22 2015 UTC,"OG means original gravity. SG means basically the same thing (starting gravity). FG is final gravity.   1.02 OG would have like 2.6% alcohol potential. If you meant OG, you probably had gravity of 1.102 and misread your hydrometer. That would give like 13.4% alcohol potential. If you mean the gravity right now is 1.02, then fermentation is basically finished with some residual sweetness."
mead,37vqa2,i_forget_my_userids,1 point,Sun May 31 03:47:35 2015 UTC,Gotcha. So adding the yeast energizer was pointless?  Is it at this point that I let it settle and transfer?
mead,37vqa2,dgiber2,2,Sun May 31 12:03:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd give it another couple weeks, rack, add sorbate and sulfate, then bottle after another couple days."
mead,37vqa2,DeathtoPants,1 point,Sun May 31 16:59:26 2015 UTC,Maybe meant SG?
mead,37vqa2,dgiber2,2,Sun May 31 00:27:50 2015 UTC,OG is the SG measurement before fermentation.
mead,37vqa2,cjeby3,2,Sun May 31 02:33:34 2015 UTC,"Right, but unless I'm missing something, and I very well could be, this post is a follow on to a batch he already made and pitched yeast into. So he took a follow on reading some time after first creating the batch, and mistakenly called it the OG."
mead,37vqa2,dbreidsbmw,2,Sun May 31 02:39:23 2015 UTC,Yeah. So this is the first measurement after fermentation.
mead,37vqa2,dbreidsbmw,3,Sun May 31 17:49:51 2015 UTC,I'm really interested to see how this turns out.  Please keep us updated!  Has anyone else ever made a batch like this?
mead,37vqa2,cjeby3,3,Sun May 31 02:00:53 2015 UTC,"I did! It was my first batch! Now I'm sitting on the last four bottles of my second (caramelized truffle) and have my third and fourth going strong (strawberry lavender 5gallons, and rhubarb lemonade 1gallon),all have been fun but my first batch. Well 1 gallon cold brewed coffee, use 0.9lbs freshly crushed grounds. Cold brew over two weeks. Dissolve 3lbs Costco bought honey, add ec-1118 and nutrients. Leave for Scandinavia for three weeks, come back, wait another month and move to secondary, filter using coffee filters. Over oxygenate, add two quarts blueberries, and campden tablets. Age for three months. Give about half away, and bulk age a half gallon. Age for another 3months. Bottle into 500ml flip tops, drink two more bottles with friends. Realize you should sweeten them instead of serving them dry and a mother fucking rural county that doesn't have Beer'sday (its a joke about a dry county) and finely add a little honey to your last two bottles after 9-10 months of aging and come to find out you were so close to getting something that was amazing but you didn't post sweeten and that at rounding in on a year old your first batch is amazing and doesn't have an ""edge"" when its sweetened. Its complex, not too bold clear as can but but the coloration is so dark you can see thought it. Also now that I'm buying three carboys for $20 Monday I'm likely going to make another coffee mead and just forget about it for a year+ and shred some blueberries in secondary. Mmmmm"
mead,37vqa2,dbreidsbmw,3,Sun May 31 05:16:43 2015 UTC,"Tl;DR the mead was good, just not served dry. Also aging helps a lot with coffee and ec-1118 may not be the best for it. 71-b was good for my caramel so maybe ill use that omw next time."
mead,37ug3h,slaming,7,Sat May 30 14:17:57 2015 UTC,"You're right, 1700g should end up in the ballpark of 1.110, unless your honey is unusually low in sugar (diluted). If you just poured water on top without stirring, this is to be expected. Honey is thick and takes a while to dilute on its own.   Do I just need to give it a stir (I'm against that idea)   Oxygen is bad after fermentation, great before. ""Shake the heck out of the jug with top on, of course. This is your sophisticated aeration process."" - Recipe   I know a lot of people frown upon JAOM   Haven't seen much of that. It's a respected beginner's mead around here.   What are the main differences between JAOM and a real mead?   Methods, basically. JAOM is really just a recipe designed for people with no dedicated brewing ingredients. ""Regular"" mead uses brewer's yeast, and is usually racked several times, with lots of aging. JAOM uses baker's yeast, is not racked until bottling, and bottled young."
mead,37ug3h,DeathtoPants,1 point,Sat May 30 14:37:27 2015 UTC,"Awesome thanks, I gave it all a good stir and a good shake up, but maybe everything didn't get worked in properly, or it was the cheaper honey I used.   If I like this will definitely be making some more as it something I can hopefully whack in a cupboard and forget about until its time to rack it. I take it there are specific mead yeasts?"
mead,37ug3h,StormBeforeDawn,1 point,Sat May 30 14:44:11 2015 UTC,Some. We can use a wide variety of yeasts based on our desired ABV. Most are designed for mead wine or champagne.
mead,37ug3h,i_forget_my_userids,2,Sat May 30 16:14:37 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone here frowns upon JAOM. The only thing about it I'd frown upon is using baker's yeast.

mead,37ug3h,bailtail,1 point,Sat May 30 19:59:53 2015 UTC,An easy improvement is using wine yeast and throwing out the orange peel.
mead,37rw99,Waldamos,2,Fri May 29 22:03:19 2015 UTC,"Sure, you're fine to taste it. After all, you will end up drinking the exact same chemicals down the line. It should clear up nicely if you give it a month, and it will continue to clear beyond that. If time is short, consider using some fining agents. What is your recipe? Unless you are using an ale yeast, it will still taste horrible in a month's time. If you want to serve him something, make him a beer as they can have a short turnaround time. Save the mead and serve him some excellent mead in six months--but by all means, give it more if you can handle the wait."
mead,37rw99,JonasTorgersen,1 point,Fri May 29 22:22:30 2015 UTC,But there are chemical reactions take place. Do I not need to give those time to take effect?
mead,37rw99,StormBeforeDawn,3,Fri May 29 22:45:50 2015 UTC,No reactions taking place. Stabilization inhibits further reactions (consumption really).

mead,37rw99,Banluil,1 point,Fri May 29 23:12:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's perfectly fine to taste now. Sulfites are used as preservatives in a plethora of food products. You ingest them all the time, you just don't realize it."

mead,37q4k2,Ionis,2,Fri May 29 15:47:35 2015 UTC,"I have read in brewing forums that some Belgian yeasts take 24 - 48 hours to start. I guess I have been spoiled using ec-1118 and WLP545, always started overnight."
mead,37q4k2,bailtail,2,Fri May 29 15:55:14 2015 UTC,Not making a starter will also delay noticeable signs of fermentation. You're only using a fraction of the recommended pitch rate.

mead,37q4k2,bailtail,2,Fri May 29 18:07:12 2015 UTC,It's likely that they were fermenting but that the CO2 hadn't yet reached saturation in your must so you didn't see the bubbles. The moving/shaking just released the Dissolved CO2 from suspension.
mead,37q4k2,sixtninecoug,1 point,Fri May 29 23:04:12 2015 UTC,"Give it time. It took some WLP720 in my last batch about 2 days to get going. Then holy hell, it took off.   I pitched it the same as you too. Let it get to room temp and sit, them heaved it in there and stirred. I was worried, but the yeast seemed good because the yeast seemed under pressure in the tube when I opened it. There was a proper ""PSSSHHHT!"" when the cap was removed.

The other is still just sitting there."
mead,37ps8u,Dirtbag_Actual,3,Fri May 29 13:08:28 2015 UTC,"The oils shouldn't be a problem assuming they aren't too excessive. I've used cocoa nibs before which also contain some oils. They haven't inhibited fermentation, and the oils tended to get left behind during racking.   I'd say the high-ish gravity is the greater hurdle, though you should still be fine so long as you keep your temp in a range D47 likes you aerate regularly. D47 can be somewhat finicky. I've found D47 and 71B to be similar, but I prefer 71B because it tends to be more forgiving (imo).   In summation, just watch your temps and aerate. Re-pitch if you still don't have action in a few days."
mead,37ps8u,bailtail,3,Fri May 29 14:19:53 2015 UTC,"I prefer 71B because it tends to be more forgiving (imo)   This is perhaps the truest statement that can be made about the mot common yeasts for brewing mead.  I would highly recommend anyone use the 71B if they are just starting out/still somewhat new, as it is one of the most forgiving yeasts.

mead,37ps8u,Banluil,1 point,Fri May 29 14:36:35 2015 UTC,"It really is a wonderful yeast. Very tolerant, versatile, and gentile on delicate flavors. It really doesn't have any major drawbacks, either."

mead,37ps8u,bailtail,2,Fri May 29 14:53:42 2015 UTC,"I mean...go for it if you really want to. Personally, I only use EC1118 if I'm truly out of options. It's just not a great mead yeast. If I were you, this is what I would do:   Aerate twice a day. You should this for the first 5-7 days of primary fermentation, especially with high-ish gravity musts like you current have. If there aren't visible signs of fermentation after 48 hours, re-pitch with D47 or 71B. Make sure you rehydrate properly before pitching, preferably with Go-Ferm. If you don't see activity in the first couple days after re-pitch, then go with EC1118.   66F is a perfectly acceptable temp btw. I don't see a problem there."
mead,37ps8u,MarsColonist,1 point,Fri May 29 15:16:52 2015 UTC,"you want around 24 hrs of lag (no activity) especially at lower temps.  1gram yeast/gallon should do you just fine. Give it some time. Also, in the beginning (first 3-6 days), stir (1xmin) daily until it stops foaming. It will increase the speed of fermentation, and as long as you have temp control, there is no downside."

Doesn't smell bad, smells like alcohol.  It is a 1 gallon batch with 3 pounds of honey, 8 raisins, and 16oz total of blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries.  It is pretty clear at the top currently and isn't bubbling anymore.  My first batch was just honey and tasted fine after two weeks, though a bit harsh.  An apple cider mead I did tastes so good I stopped it and am drinking it now.  I believe I just need to sweeten it..?"
mead,37nz53,BloodBlight,3,Fri May 29 01:16:44 2015 UTC,"I recently did finished my first fruit meads (I am very new as well), and it took the blueberry 3 months before it was drinkable.  The strawberry took about 5!  Like really, it tasted almost bitter, then suddenly, it just changed.  So, I would let it set for another month or two.  What yeast did you use?"
mead,37nz53,bailtail,2,Fri May 29 01:39:48 2015 UTC,"I used Fleischmann's active dry. I figured I either needed to add fruit, just wait, more honey, or all 3 but I felt I should do something!"
mead,37nz53,Falco98,3,Fri May 29 11:50:34 2015 UTC,"You're only three weeks in. Meads generally take 6-12 months, if not more, to really come into their own. The alcohol smell and taste will mellow with time. 8 raisins and a pound of berries would only provide a small amount of nutrients, so your yeast were probably a little cranky. When yeast get cranky, they don't ferment as cleanly. When yeast don't ferment cleanly, you get more fusel alcohols and sometimes off-flavors. Once you have those in your mead, you're going to have to age longer.   It is quite possible that your yeast managed to chew through all or nearly all of your sugars. If that's the case, you may want to throw some additional fruit in there. You have the room to do so. Having said that, we can't properly advise you without gravity readings or, at the very least, an indication of which yeast strain you used."
mead,37nz53,Creid90,2,Fri May 29 04:25:59 2015 UTC,"In addition to what others have said (i.e. more time), it should start changing character a bit after it's been racked once or twice.  I usually do a ""greedy"" racking after 3 or 4 weeks - meaning I only care about getting the larger chunks out, and most of the yeast cake gone, but not caring if I get a bit of sediment in the siphon, in order to maximize the liquid i get out.  From there I let it settle out and it'll usually start to clarify pretty nicely; the taste starts purifying at this point too."

mead,37nbrs,Loki_Sunday,2,Fri May 29 03:43:07 2015 UTC,"There are some saison yeasts that are reportedly ok up to 90F.     I would also add that while this will be a multiple month undertaking your temps are the most critical during the vigorous primary fermentation which might be as little as 1-2 weeks.     Point being don't let yourself think ""I can't lower the temp for 3 months therefore I won't bother to do it at all.""   Do what you can to ferment on the lower end of the yeast you choose, at least the first 2 weeks or so.  Remember that the temp in the fermenter will be 5-10F warmer than the ambient air temp.   If you do nothing and ferment very hot you'll likely add many months of aging before it will taste good to you."
mead,37nbrs,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,2,Fri May 29 17:54:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with others about eh basement being a great option. As long as the airlock stays intact it should really be fine.   That said, if you want to brew aboveground, you might want to try an old trick: buy one of those air fans and aim it at the fermentation device. Wrap the device in soaking wet towels and engage the fan (make sure it's electrics won't get wet). Congratulations, you have just rednecked (if this isn't a verb yet, then I'm coining it) yourself an airconditioner, keep;ing hte room and the mead cool as it goes. Just make sure the towels stay wet and you're ok."
mead,37nbrs,Socratov,1 point,Sat May 30 17:06:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, everybody! I decided to go with the Lalvin EC-1118 and to do initial fermentation with a swamp cooler upstairs (where I can keep an eye on the water levels). I'll take it down to the basement for the secondary fermentation, since I won't have to check it as often.  As far as the recipe, I plan on using the basic Dry Mead recipe on this   page, with chopped raisins as the nutrient. It's going to make a five-gallon batch, so I'll split it up when I rack it for the first time (probably into a three-gallon and two one-gallon carboys) so I can play around with different flavorings.  I'll post the results when I taste the finished product in December or so. Thanks again for the help!"

mead,37l9vg,fuziel,1 point,Thu May 28 15:48:44 2015 UTC,No need to kill the yeast! When your satisfied with the taste drop the temperature.

mead,37l9vg,cowboys703,3,Thu May 28 14:39:44 2015 UTC,"fwiw, I'm not sure how great of an idea it is to reuse mead yeast (especially something like wyeast that is designed for beer).   Most meads end up being pretty high in alcohol which puts quite a bit of pressure on the yeast and can lead to later generations being stressed out. Add in the fact that the must lacks a lot of essential nutrients for mead and you get some unhappy yeast.   This is, of course, my semi-educated opinion. With how cheap a few packets of D-47 are compared to the cost of the honey required to make a full batch it's something I'd gladly pay every time."
mead,37l9vg,fuziel,1 point,Thu May 28 15:58:22 2015 UTC,While I understand your reasoning every yeast type is different. Beer yeast usually cannot handle mead alcohol levels. But that is why mead uses different yeast. The yeast used in mead can handle the alcohol levels produced because that's why they are used in mead. They have been engineered and cultivated in labs to do exactly that.    As for  must not having the proper nutrition for the yeast this is true for even your first batch on the new yeast fresh from the package. That's why yeast nutrition is important. You would have to add it in to a sloppy second slurry just like a fresh opened wyeast package just being added into a new must.
mead,37l9vg,cowboys703,3,Thu May 28 16:17:25 2015 UTC,"Beer yeast usually cannot handle mead alcohol levels. But that is why mead uses different yeast.   OP is using wyeast which only does beer yeast.   And one of the reasons (that I've been told) why you don't want to make starters with an OG past 1.055 or so is because even the yeast strains that are designed to make really high alcohol beers become stressed in those environments. Sure, a lot of yeast is good but you want the healthiest available yeast.   If you want to save on yeast costs I much prefer to overbuild my starters by about 100 billion cells and then store them in a sanitized glass jar in the fridge."

mead,37l9vg,bailtail,1 point,Thu May 28 19:12:50 2015 UTC,"It isn't advise able to reuse yeast that has been used for higher gravity applications. The reason for this is because the after a higher gravity fermentation, yeast have been stress and are no longer uniform due to mutations.   Yes, beer yeasts and wine yeasts differ, but high gravity and high alcohol environments still cause a lot of stress, even in yeasts that are more tolerant. You hear of beer makers reusing yeasts. This is because beers are generally lower gravity and the liquid yeasts that are typically used are comparatively much more expensive. I'm not aware of any winemakers that harvest and reuse yeast. If there are some, there's not many. There's a reason why that is the case."
mead,37l9vg,ThatMeadGuy,1 point,Fri May 29 19:45:43 2015 UTC,"ThatMeadGuy here!  High temperatures are the enemy of your mead.  Temperature swings in general are bad, taking it into pasteurization temps causes premature aging, oxidation, and generally lessens the bouquet/flavor of the finished product.    If you want to get rid of the yeast completely instead of using potassium sorbate and sulfites (like most do), use a fining agent, then filter."

Large amounts of dead yeast can lead to some amazing off aromas.  Small amounts of yeast, not such a problem. That said, heat will promote oxidation and potentially drive off delicate aromas, which is why sulfites are preferred.  Sulfites will also help protect your mead from oxygen, but if you put in too much it will smell like a burnt match! 40-45 C will probably kill some of the yeast, but not all.  Other responses here were good about that point.  50-55C."

I advocate staying away from heat with mead, myself. There are applications where pasteurization can be useful for mead, however. If you want a sparkling semi-sweet mead, for example, pasteurization after a certain degree of bottle carbonation has been achieved is one of the only ways to get the desired result.

You can backsweeten as much as you want regardless.  If you want it to end up sweet (> 1.000 anyway) then I usually start in the 1.12x range with 71B.    1 pound of honey is about .035-.040 in 1 gallon.  So if you wanted to backsweeten 1 gallon of something at 1.000 to 1.007 or so, put about 1/5 pound of honey in to backsweeten.    To get gravity readings use a hydrometer.  No other substitute really other than a refractometer and those are more expensive and have their own issues.  Search YouTube I am sure there are ""how to read a hydrometer"" videos."

mead,37ewxb,fromaries,3,Fri May 29 01:14:22 2015 UTC,I've read that you can actually get past their alcohol tolerance if you keep incrementally adding more and more fermentable sugars as you're doing. You're pretty much selectively breeding the yeast cells that can tolerate the higher levels of alcohol this way.
mead,37ewxb,WildYarnDreams,1 point,Thu May 28 02:38:48 2015 UTC,"You know, that's an interesting theory. You may be onto something there. I've heard of similar things in regards to selective yeast harvesting from conicals with beer (harvest the bottommost yeast to select for lesser tolerance and visa versa). There is little-to-no accumulation of lees at the bottom of the fermenter, something I'd expect more of in such a scenario, but unintentional selective breeding could certainly be part of the puzzle. Perhaps there's some magical combo of natural selection, mutation, nutrients, environmental favorability, etc. at play."
mead,37ewxb,Herr_herr,4,Thu May 28 04:50:14 2015 UTC,My first guess is that you have another yeast in there assuming you have measured your SG correctly.  Could have gotten the other yeast in there a number of ways.
mead,37ewxb,BarnDaddy,2,Wed May 27 08:17:32 2015 UTC,"I've considered that, but I just can't see how it would be possible barring Wyeast putting the wrong strain in a 4184 package. I'm diligent with sterilization and sanitation and I pitched a healthy starter that I grew from two smack packs, so even if wild yeast were able to make it in there they wouldn't have had much chance to compete. Unless the yeast were able to mutate to an extreme degree, I don't what the hell is going on. Also, I know my gravity readings are correct. I've taken a series of them given the situation. I've taken them with my refractometer and verified with my hydrometer."

mead,37ewxb,BlueLu,2,Wed May 27 15:05:36 2015 UTC,I think you're right. I've often seen it mentioned in forums that 4184 tend to go higher than its stated tolerance. I just didn't realize the extent. I was figuring 14% max.
mead,37ewxb,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,2,Wed May 27 17:31:19 2015 UTC,"Adding sugar towards the end of a still active fermentation is a classic method of making very strong booze!  I have heard it called 'feeding the yeast' and is still used today I think.  Usually you would add about 0.5 Plato of sugar to your tank, check the next day to ensure it was fermented, then add another 0.5 Plato, and do this daily until the yeast stopped fermenting it.  This is supposed to be very effective at fermenting well past advertised 'alcohol tolerances' and sounds like what you might have accomplished!"

If they have nutrients and are fermented at the cooler side of their temperature range champagne yeasts can produce a fairly clean product. They can be tough to reign-in though.

mead,37egq6,Nachotime,2,Wed May 27 16:15:33 2015 UTC,"Not as good, but I think that was because of the seal being broken on that bottle. I saved another, with a good seal, to put in a personal collection."

I generally ferment mine to the sweetness that I want, and then add in the flavorings. In this case about a half a pound of a strong, black tea spiced chai blend to five gallons. I let it steep for a week or two, strain out the tea, and a lovely drink is left behind."

After I added three lbs honey and let it cool (which took a while) I pitched the yeast and let it work. After I racked to secondary, I made up the rest of the volume with more tea. Smokey tea flavor really came out. Thought about trying Earl Grey, you'll have to report back"
mead,37f0fx,nenanen,2,Wed May 27 04:46:22 2015 UTC,I've put 2L of oolong black tea in my meads and have found that the yeast action just obliterates the flavor.  If you're going for a strong tea flavor in your final product I'd recommend adding brewed tea after primary has completed.

mead,37f0fx,naudir,2,Sat May 30 14:11:54 2015 UTC,Why not split the difference and go with lavender honey with a steeped EG mixture?  That way you'll get the pure EG flavor from the tea and the unmitigated lavender flavor from the honey.
mead,37f0fx,naudir,2,Wed May 27 07:52:02 2015 UTC,"regarding lavender honey... i have a batch of traditional mead aging made with lavender honey from portugal and 71B yeast. it's about 5 months old and i don't love it right now. it tastes and smells floral, but not distinctly of lavender flowers. maybe more of the lavender will come out as it ages, but as of right now i think i'll have to add culinary lavender to get the flavor i was looking for."
mead,37fo1e,philippeowagner,3,Wed May 27 07:49:55 2015 UTC,"Without really using a set recipe, one rule of thumb commonly used here is 1.5 kg honey/4 liters of water. For the apricots, 0.5 kg/1 liter of must or more is generally used, depending on how strong you want your fruity flavor. This measurement is for whole fruit, so you might want to use less, given that much of their weight in water has been removed. You could also consider splitting the fruit between primary and secondary. Its flavor changes slightly when it has been fermented.  With melomels where fruit is added, a bucket is much more user friendly than a carboy, as the fruit is significantly easier to remove when your fermentation is finished. You start be heating your honey, not hot but warm, and putting it into your fermenter. You then top up with water to get your desired batch size, and stir or shake until all the honey has been dissolved. This has the added benefit of aerating your must. You add your nutrient, any fruit you decide to use, and then pitch your yeast."

mead,37bvvt,brownestrabbit,2,Tue May 26 14:21:26 2015 UTC,How are you going to get the fruit out later?
mead,37bvvt,StormBeforeDawn,3,Tue May 26 14:55:15 2015 UTC,It should be very soft after a month or two. If I have any trouble I'll fashion a small hook out of a coat hanger to pull it out.
mead,37bvvt,StormBeforeDawn,2,Tue May 26 14:57:33 2015 UTC,It works. After a time or two you will switch to a bucket for fruit primaries.
mead,37bvvt,BloodBlight,2,Tue May 26 17:43:29 2015 UTC,I didn't want to tie up my bucket for two months. If this works out I'll buy a bucket just for mead since it would be easier.

mead,37cvyw,LaD-Cucho,3,Tue May 26 18:27:24 2015 UTC,"Popular yeasts are 71B-1122, ICV-D47, EC-1118.  People sometimes use ale yeasts like Wyeast 1388.  If your mead is no longer ""sparkling"" the status totally depends on the recipe.  It might be out of sugar but not yet at the yeast's alcohol tolerance (so it could ferment more if you added more sugars).  Or it may be stalled due to lack of nutrients or pH issues.    We would need the recipe and all nutrients you've used as well as gravity readings (from a hydrometer, just buy one)  If you aren't sure what the gravity is be extremely careful about adding sugar and bottling as you could cause your bottles to explode.  All of the flavors you listed work well and are fairly popular.  There really are no limits, use the flavors you enjoy.   Search the web and this subreddit for things people have already done."
mead,37cvyw,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,2,Tue May 26 19:12:36 2015 UTC,"thx very much; i made 2 recipes: -1 kg of honey and 5 lts of water (i made 4 kg of honey and 20 lts of water) -1.25 kg of honey and 5 lts of water (i made 5 kg of honey and 20 lts of water). no nutrients or anything else (literally newbie, i made the mead with homemade fermentors and stuff)."
mead,37cvyw,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,2,Tue May 26 19:29:42 2015 UTC,"What yeast?  In any case your yeast are probably out of sugar and will ferment again if you add any sugar which is why you should be careful about adding sugar and bottling.  Converted to pounds and gallons (which I am more used to) you have for example 8.818 lbs honey in 5.283 gallons.  That is only a potential alcohol of 8.15%.  Almost all yeast will exceed that with perhaps the exception of bread yeast from a store but I bet it would exceed that as well.  For example 71B and D47 go to 14% and more and 1118 goes to 18% and more.  Until you have a better handle on gravity and yeast tolerances I personally would not add sugar before bottling.  You can bottle now if you are quite sure it is totally done fementing.  By you can only really be sure if you have a hydrometer reading.  If it doesn't bubble at all for a few weeks you might be OK to bottle without adding any sugar.  Otherwise you would have to look at stabilizing with potassium metabisulfite (Campden) and potassium sorbate.  Then you could add more sugar but it wouldn't carbonate, only sweeten.  Beyond that if you're really out of sugar (your mead is totally dry and out of fermentable sugars, as indicated by a hydrometer reading) you could theoretically add just enough sugar to achieve the carbonation (""sparkling"") you desire.  I never do this for mead, only beer, so unfortunately I cannot advise you there."
mead,37cvyw,MyOtherBrotherDarryl,2,Tue May 26 19:55:55 2015 UTC,"anyways, thanx a lot, i'll buy proper stuff as soon as possible... the yeast that i use is nottingham (i was told that nottingham and champ are good ones for mead)."
mead,37cvyw,dvallej,3,Tue May 26 20:13:22 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I have never used Nottingham and I can not locate any reference for its alcohol tolerance other than ""high"" so I'll stick with my advice so far.  If I found something that said Nottingham had an alcohol tolerance of 8-9% I might be comfortable advising you to add sugar before bottling.  But without a gravity reading and some known tolerance for the yeast (which would tell us how likely it is that is has done all it can do and died off) there are just too many unknowns (for me)."

mead,37796j,JonasTorgersen,6,Mon May 25 13:50:48 2015 UTC,So this was my first time distilling anything. The smell contains a very slight hint of sweetness from the honey. The alcohol smell is very powerful. When tasting it you can detect a nice honey/meady flavor right after the burn. I think I may cut it with some water.
mead,37796j,woman_WOAH_man,4,Mon May 25 14:17:30 2015 UTC,"Perhaps cut with water, drip some honey in there and add some elderberry blossom flowers to it for some time. Should give a strong but somewhat sweet drink which basically smells like springtime."

mead,37796j,woman_WOAH_man,1 point,Mon May 25 20:17:52 2015 UTC,The point of the oak in my stupid opinion is that they are there to take away the bite and smooth it out. If you don't want the oak flavor don't use many chips.   Obviously soak then and get the oak flavor our first.   Another thing to do would be to let the clear shine sit for a month or so with the top open and a coffee filter over it to let it breathe and the honey could really come through.

mead,377546,Aurimass,0,Mon May 25 12:48:57 2015 UTC,"Energizer is not required to make mead. What it does is kickstart the fermentation, but leaving it out will have no ill effects. The five tablespoons of nutrient is what you would use with one particular brand, though I don't have the the answer to which one this is. Use what your nurtient instructs you to use. With mine (WLP1000), for example, one teaspoon is enough for 5 gallons.  EDIT: Also, this was my first mead too. Same recipe. I would change one thing in hindsight. Skip the step with heating the honey. Dump your ingredients into the fermenter and mix it until everything is dissolved. This will take some time. Keeping the honey at room temperature preserves the aroma, which some if is lost during heating."
mead,377546,JonasTorgersen,1 point,Mon May 25 13:02:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Mead will ferment in a room with ~ 72F temperature, will it be not too much (somewhere read that ~60F is the best) ? And what does it mean to stabilize mead?? Never had to do it before (brewed just beer) :)"
mead,377546,Waldamos,2,Mon May 25 13:21:14 2015 UTC,"I did this recipe and let it go at 75.  I thought that was recommended, looking back now I should have done around 60. After a month it was like jet fuel.  I hope it comes out of it."
mead,377546,StormBeforeDawn,2,Mon May 25 18:08:20 2015 UTC,"This isn't much like beer as far as sterilization goes. If your fruit is sterile your must won't have any issues (and even is it isn't, aggressive yeast and high ABV keeps things clean.) Campden tabs in your fruit 2 days before pitch + agressive star san and you are good to go. Heating removes aromas."
mead,377546,JonasTorgersen,1 point,Tue May 26 00:01:37 2015 UTC,"71B has an optimum range of 59-86F, so you are well within this range. A colder fermented mead (and beer for that matter) will ferment cleaner, so if you want, a swamp cooler might be a cheap way to lower your fermentation temperature by a few degrees. I think it was today, but very recently, there was a simirar discusison in r/homebrewing that explored this deeper. If I weren't on mobile, I'd link you.  Stabilizing your mead is something that you do after your fermentation is completed. When the fermentation comes to a stop, you add potassium metabisulfite (kmeta in this sub), which will kill the yeast. If you decide that you want to backsweeten, then you add potassium sorbate (ksorb), which prevents any yeast that survived the kmeta from multiplying and resuming fermentation. If you do not end up back sweetening, you should be fine with kmeta, or you can skip it entirely. That works too.

You want to ferment on the lower end of the temperature range for your yeast.  Aerate the mead my stirring vigorously for the first few days, some people say until 1/3 of the sugar has been eaten.  Most people will aerate then add nutrients and when it hits 1/3, degas (gently stir to get the CO2 out and don't let O2 in)"

It was maybe my second or third attempt at making mead many years ago when I was still trying to get the hang of things. I ended up with a VERY dry mead that I backsweetened with more honey. After bottling it became a moderately sweet lightly carbonated sparkling mead (Thank Odin I used beer bottles that could handle a little pressure).

I let the berries sit in the mead for a month before removing them; I suggest upping the mulberries by a few pounds and backsweetening it as well."

Is this an expected drop after 4 days? There was still no activity in the airlock and the must looked super cloudy and had chunks of something in it (I'm assuming yeast?), as you can see in the picture.

mead,372fl4,Bunsomel,1 point,Sun May 24 16:04:38 2015 UTC,"The thing to keep in mind about ale yeasts and wine yeasts is that they have been selected over generations to be the best at what they do. Wine yeasts have trouble fermenting beer wort because they typically have a hard time breaking down the longer chain sugars and carbohydrates found in it, and ale yeasts typically have a hard time fermenting wine musts because those musts are nearly devoid of the abundance of nutrients that they are used to getting in a beer wort.   That's not to say it doesn't work though. You may find that ale yeasts attenuate far greater than they would in a normal beer wort, because now those yeasts don't have to break down the more complex sugars, and can now concentrate on the abundance of glucose & sucrose molecules. However, if you just pitch an ale yeast and forget it, be prepared for stressed yeast and off flavors.  Ale yeast should do completely fine as long as you are supplementing the must with nutrient. Aerating the must adequately and keeping fermentation temps low will also help."
mead,370o4t,theavanttard,5,Sat May 23 19:40:18 2015 UTC,"Better picture of color and carbonation.  When I moved into my new house, the previous tenant left a bit of brewing equipment (Two cases of Flip-Cap bottles, a couple glass 5-Gallon carboys) I figured I might as well try something out.  Since I didn't follow a recipe, I'll try to remember what I did here.  2 Gallon batch made from:  4 lbs Honey (Also left by previous tenant)  1 lb Fresh Citra Hops boiled for an hour.  A couple tsps citric acid, juice from 1 lemon.  2 Packets Champagne Yeast,  1 tube of Yeast nutrient  Let ferment 5 months  Bottled 5 bottles as still mead, then added 2 tbsp priming sugar for seven more bottles of a lightly carbonated sparkling mead.  I know I have no idea what I'm doing, so feedback on the recipe won't hurt my feelings.  If I was going to do it again, all I'd do differently is rack it after a couple months.  EDIT: Forgot to mention, I didn't think it was going to turn out well, so I didn't bother taking an OG reading, so the abv is anyone's guess. My guess after multiple trials is that it's North of 8%."
mead,370o4t,turboladen,3,Sat May 23 19:49:24 2015 UTC,"Sounds pretty tasty! I love me some citrus meads.   Like you said, I'd probably rack a little more frequently--I tend to base it off how much lees have accumulated, which those first couple of months there's usually quite a bit. So I'm probably like once a month for racking in those first couple of months.  Also, I'd wager that you don't need to use that much yeast. One package is generally good for a 5G batch.  Happy meading!"
mead,370o4t,LegiticusMaximus,2,Sat May 23 23:00:36 2015 UTC,"I'm glad it worked out for you!  One thing to note is that even without a recipe, you need to use a priming sugar calculator to calculate the amount of sugar you need for the carbonation you want.  If you use too much sugar, your bottles could explode (this happened to me once when I made a mistake in measuring out the sugar).  2 tbsp for 7 bottles is obviously not very much, but when doing full carbonation you have to be careful.  It's typically better to dissolve your sugar in hot water first, so that it's in aqueous form and can distribute evenly amongst your bottles.  Are you sure you used 1 lb of citra hops and not one ounces?  sounds like it should be bitter but you said it tasted fine."

mead,36y2zi,fasda,3,Sat May 23 02:06:27 2015 UTC,"Before you add the honey, put it in a (big!)pot and bring it to a boil. Keep stirring constantly. Shortly before reaching a desired color, add water. Be careful not to splash the honey. Keep up the heat and stir until the honey is completely mixed with the water. Wait for it to cool or add more water, then put it into your fermenter.  Doing this, you caramelise the sugar in the honey. This will give some other toasty flavours, reminiscent of toffee and roasted marshmallow. You'll also render some of the sugars unfermentable, meaning higher FG. As such, I'd either boil for fairly short time, or not boil all the honey.  Alternatively, you could look for a darker honey variety.  If you're not getting enough color from the fruit, on the other hand, you can either as more, or use some a more vibrant fruit as well."
mead,36y2zi,DeathtoPants,6,Sat May 23 02:26:17 2015 UTC,"I mean....yeah, if he wants to make a completely different genre of mead. Bochets can be nice, but resorting to making one just because you want a darker color seems extreme.   Darker honey would be one way to go. I have a buckwheat traditional aging right now that is a beautiful mahogany. If you want the character of a lighter honey but the color of a darker honey, you could mix the honeys with the lighter honey being 80% or better.   Other ideas off the top of my head:   Use a small amount of black tea. This will impart some tannins, so you'll need to account for that when balancing your flavors. Including the tea in primary instead of secondary should mitigate the tea flavors to a degree while still retaining the color. Food coloring. There are natural food colorings out there if you do a bit of research. As an example, I've used beet juice powder to achieve a deep magenta color. A tiny bit imparts a very deep color, and there is no perceptible change in flavor.    That's all I can come up with at the moment. Personally, I don't worry about what color my meads turn out to be. I like the idea that the colors help portray the ingredients that were used.   EDIT:  I just saw the part about melomels. Adding fruit in primary tends to result in more color than if you just add fruit in secondary. If you like the flavoring of secondary additions better, you could always split the fruit up into primary and secondary.

mead,36tow2,thetreece,3,Fri May 22 01:08:29 2015 UTC,There shouldn't be enough alcohol after a day (less in practice due to lag phase) to affect the enzyme. You've got nothing to lose either way.

Sounds like particulate from your honey. I have a few meads made with raw honey that are clear at the bottom and hazy towards the top (though not as large a layer as you describe). If this is what's going on, it's nothing to worry about.   After I got all I could transferred over,  I looked through the neck into the bottom and realized that there were no dead yeast on the bottom,  so my yeast died sometime during my first go round.   This confuses me. You say there was noticeable booziness when you tasted but that your yeast died. Was your most recent transfer from primary to secondary or secondary to tertiary? Obviously the yeast took to your must. We're that not the case, you wouldn't have booze. If your most recent transfer was from secondary to tertiary, your yeast probably just got left behind when you transferred from primary to secondary. That's what is supposed to happen. Unless I'm missing something, I don't really see a problem here."

mead,36rtnp,balathustrius,5,Thu May 21 22:39:26 2015 UTC,"I doubt it.  If you aren't adding sugar, sweetness can't go up.  What can happen though is relative sweetness or perceived sweetness can go up as other things mellow like hops or spices or tannins.  In other words it's a function of the aging and not of backsweetening.  That's my opinion."
mead,36sbww,Waldamos,2,Thu May 21 18:56:10 2015 UTC,"How long has it been since you started the batch?  If you've stabilized your mead, adding sugars shouldn't create any more CO2 since no fermentation takes place. I'd also leave it for a while to let the mead clear back up.  Hours before bottling: Clean and sanitize equipment and bottles.  Days before bottling: Decide that you're satisfied with your mead's current flavor and clarity. Pick a time for bottling."
mead,36sbww,DeathtoPants,1 point,Thu May 21 19:53:54 2015 UTC,"I pitched 2 months ago.  I haven't stabilized yet.  I was thinking of taking a sample and racking tonight onto some Kmeta and Ksorb.  Then deciding if I want to back sweeten or not.  If yes, add honey tomorrow.  If no, bottle some time in the next month.  But I need to know if I need to get a degasser or not before bottling."
mead,36sbww,DeathtoPants,1 point,Thu May 21 20:19:28 2015 UTC,"Is it more carbonated than you'd want it to be right now? If so, you might want to degas. It will also slowly keep degassing as you age it, though I don't think a month will make significant difference.  Personally, I'd do what you're planning to, then rack to a bottling container. If it's too carbonated by then, look into degassing.  You don't have to degas as there's not remotely close to dangerous amounts of CO2 suspended in the mead, it's just a question if whether you prefer it flat or slightly sparkly."
mead,36sbww,wtf81,1 point,Thu May 21 20:31:21 2015 UTC,I do not know that I would know which way I want it as it is my first one.  I think to not complicate things I will go forward with my plan and not degas.  I was just worried that the current amount of CO2 would be a problem or something.

mead,36opes,Herr_herr,3,Thu May 21 04:11:40 2015 UTC,"It was bottled too early. They were only selling them in the tasting rooms, and at a discount, because of the issue. They were being upfront about it every time someone bought a bottle, telling them to put it in the freezer for a bit, and to open it over a sink.  Regardless, that sucks. Go to the Oceanside tasting room and talk to Ryan, I'm sure he'll be more than happy to make it right."
mead,36opes,gcmfrank,2,Thu May 21 15:48:26 2015 UTC,"Hey unadventurer, Thanks for trying our mead, and then finding a bottle.  I am Frank and I started Golden Coast Mead with two friends.  Now I'm the CEO (a.k.a. doer-of-things-that-no-one-else-has-direct-responsibility-for) and Head Mead Maker.  We are a small company (5 employees), and we're young, but we're committed to making the best, most authentic mead we can and delighting people with it. To that end, we don't filter, pasteurize or add preservatives to our mead; we craft it to be delicious, balanced and refreshing.  However, since we bottle with some residual sugar and yeast, there is a risk of overcarbonation resulting from bottle conditioning.  Some of the best breweries in the world have encountered this problem (Lost Abbey, Dogfishhead and more) and what defined their success was how they solved it and dealt with their customers who had less than awesome experiences. An overcarbonated bottle is a problem, and I'm sorry you had one.  In order to make it right, please come into the tasting room in Oceanside when we're open and mention this conversation to Ryan, our tasting room manager, he will make it right for you. On the technical side, we are now drying our meads out to less than 1 brix, and clarifying them using coldcrashing further than ever before in the hopes that we can achieve natural clarity and effervescence.  Going forward, over-carbonation should be a low probability risk.  However, if you or anyone else encounters it, please reach out to us and we'll make sure you leave GCM stoked. Thanks again for your time and effort trying our meads.  Please come by the tasting room in Oceanside and we'll make sure you have a good experience. Cheers! Frank"

mead,36opes,Bunsomel,1 point,Thu May 21 20:34:06 2015 UTC,"That is pretty unacceptable. The bottle either was infected, or they bottled too early, either of which is a concern for the rest of the batch. You might want to reach out to them and let them know, although, if it isn't a singular incident, they probably already know about it and should be trying to recall their product.  There's a brewery out here where I am that sold their RIS in 6-packs and quickly after they hit the market people were complaining that the beer was way overcarbed, and possibly infected. To my knowledge, they haven't done anything proactive about it and that is really off-putting. Terrible way to do business."

mead,36kwfh,StormBeforeDawn,1 point,Wed May 20 04:29:43 2015 UTC,"I a still a novice (very much so), but that seems like a whole lot of sugar even with the 1118.  I second Storm, spend the $5-$10 on a hydrometer!  Maybe take a sample, see where you are before you go onto more fruit.  OP, how long has it been?  For the pros out there, wouldn't this be a bit early to rack it?  I would think you would wait until the yeasties were are almost before adding more fruit.  I would think you would retain more flavor that way."
mead,36kwfh,BloodBlight,1 point,Wed May 20 04:39:32 2015 UTC,Its been about a month. Yeah I'll probably get a hydrometer- just need to figure out how to use it! What do you mean by a whole lot of sugar? Wouldn't waiting until the yeast is finished before adding more fruit make it more sweet?
mead,36kwfh,BloodBlight,1 point,Wed May 20 04:49:15 2015 UTC,"So take everything I say with a grain of salt!!!  I am new to this myself!  I was talking about adding the additional raspberries when racking.  But I just ran it though the estimator and it may not be as bad as I was thinking. http://meadcalc.freevar.com/  When you rack it the yeast will kick right back off, so unless you artificially stop the yeast (kill them), they will keep eating until the alcohol content is above what they can handle (18% with 1118) or run out of food.  So if your gravity indicates a 20% (1.15) when you started, it would be up to 18% alcohol and 2% sugar (right?).  If it was %10 you would be left with a very dry wine, but if it was 25% you would be left with a VERY sweet wine. You can always add more water and do a second ferment, but it is a real pain (had to do it once, now I use a hydrometer).  The hydrometer just tells you the current potential of the must (it has to be well mixed).    Gravity: http://i.imgur.com/uU6c3jn.jpg  vs  Alcohol: http://i.imgur.com/iNtG5pH.jpg  I just look at the alcohol, though most of the makers I have talked to all work in gravity."
mead,36kwfh,StormBeforeDawn,1 point,Wed May 20 05:25:05 2015 UTC,"No, yeast will stay healthy for months in suspension sometimes. For 1118, I have seen that go as high as 19% abv, but usually craps out at 18%. Your must should be a lower potential abv than that by a little bit. 3lbs/gal is good, even with fruit additions. I like to tack off the lees after 1 month personally."
mead,36kwfh,Creid90,0,Wed May 20 06:52:01 2015 UTC,This is going to be my next project. How does it taste so far?  From my experience with other projects waiting for it to stop fermenting before racking help a ton.

mead,36j7dc,Bunsomel,3,Wed May 20 01:35:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, this works best with soft fruits. Though perhaps after fermentation, even some hard fruits may be soft enough to be pressed.   Whole grapes are used in wine. Many winemakers swear by whole berry fermentation, where many micro-fermentations take place within the berry, forcing the juice through the pores of the skins and extracting flavor, color, and body on the way. Winemakers ferment with the skins for red wine to extract flavor, color and more. White wine is not fermented on the skins so it doesn't take on a bitter flavor and has a clear color."

mead,36jt7g,saxmaster98,5,Tue May 19 22:23:22 2015 UTC,"Why are you only wanting to do half a gallon? For the time commitment that is aging, if much rather have at least a gallon.  But to answer your question, halve everything. Normally I'd say that you don't have to halve the yeast, but for only a half gallon, 5 g of yeast is quite a bit, no idea if it would cause issues. I'd use half the 5 g pack or even less.  Temperature: that's higher than I like to be, but it will work just fine. You could use a swamp cooler but I wouldn't bother for less than 5 gallons. I like 62-70, ideally right at 62.  As for time, fermentation itself should take 1-4 weeks, depending on many factors. Aging is what will take months. Two to four months to clear, four to six to be brilliant and start to actually mature."
mead,36jt7g,balathustrius,3,Tue May 19 22:53:31 2015 UTC,"So if I'm understanding everything, just make the whole gallon, keep it below 70 if possible but above 60, and for the best results, it'll be about 6 months"
mead,36jt7g,balathustrius,3,Tue May 19 23:09:51 2015 UTC,"Temperature also depends on the yeast. I stay a little above 60. But yeah, sounds right. Check my post history for a series of links that will be useful to you, including a F.A.Q. I'm on mobile or I'd link you."
mead,36jt7g,I_ABUSED_YOUR_CHAIR,1 point,Wed May 20 00:02:24 2015 UTC,"Agree on the gallon part. I'd even say that OP might like to make 2 gallons at least. For something that takes 6-12 months to make, a gallon will be gone so fast in good company.  Temperature isnt really a big bother if it's your first batch IMHO. It may give off taste x or y a bit but most people hardly notice that and beginners should IMO focus on getting a succesful product and get to know how to work hygiene and see how its all like.  So OP, we could recommend all sorts of things like temperature regulations, gravity calculations, yeasts, fermentation vessels and whatnot, but just remember that most people start with a JAOM with bread yeast in soda bottles with a balloon on top and I havent heard much complains about those. I think my sodabottle balloonlock currant mead may still be the best I've made so far. Saving the last bottle for when I get married or something.  No critisism, just adding to your comment."

Do a full gallon and bottle in beer bottles. This will allow you to crack one open every couple months or so to see how it's tasting.   At this point, almost all of my batches are 2-gallons or more. I may go 1-gallon if I'm trying something off-the-wall that has a decent chance of flopping, but that's as low as I'll go."
mead,36jt7g,Alcoholic_Autonomous,1 point,Wed May 20 03:39:37 2015 UTC,"If you use Lalvin EC 1118 or Lalvin 71B you should be fine at 75 F.   Cutting all your ingredients in half should be fine, but there's no point in cutting the yeast itself in half. Just pitch one packet and you will be alright.  Primary fermentation will be different for each recipe, each yeast, and each temperature. So instead of just setting an arbitrary time, you should keep an eye on the krausen levels, bubbles in the air lock, or keep track of the gravity.  But keep in mind your mead won't be done when primary fermentation is. You should give your mead at least 3-4 months to mellow and some people even wait years.  Hope some of this helped. Good luck with your first brew."
mead,36jt7g,bailtail,2,Wed May 20 01:24:32 2015 UTC,"If you use Lalvin EC 1118 or Lalvin 71B you should be fine at 75 F.    Yes, yeast selection is going to be important if temps are at 75. I'd recommend 71B over EC1118 for any non-extreme fermentation, but I'd say it's especially important in this situation. 1118 is an extremely vigorous fermenter to the point of being problematic. It works so quickly that it throws flavors right out the airlock and throws off fusels. Fermenting on the lower end of the temp range can slow it down to a degree and give a cleaner fermentation, but with room temps at 75 and a vigorous fermenter like 1118, must temps are going to be in the 75-80 range. There's a good chance OP is looking at a couple years of aging if he rolls with 1118 under those conditions."
mead,36jt7g,naudir,1 point,Wed May 20 03:53:04 2015 UTC,"i have tasted meads fermented with various wine yeasts in hot temperatures (75F+), and they were NOT as good as meads fermented at cooler temperatures (60-70F). they can develop fusel alcohols and taste like nail polish remover/ rocket fuel. the harsh flavors can age out over time, but may not fully go away."
mead,36jt7g,naudir,1 point,Wed May 20 04:12:58 2015 UTC,So I'd like to keep it in the mid 60s for better results?
mead,36jt7g,naudir,1 point,Wed May 20 10:27:15 2015 UTC,"yes, definitely.   during active fermentation (first week approx) your mead will be a few degrees warmer than ambient room temperature because fermentation is an exothermic reaction. so if you ferment at a 65F room temperature you can assume you've stayed under the 70F upper limit before the yeast will start producing off flavors."
mead,36jt7g,naudir,2,Wed May 20 15:17:33 2015 UTC,"Over all, the best temp is to keep it under 70?"
mead,36ilig,sharkdog73,4,Tue May 19 17:35:54 2015 UTC,I did a peach/cherry. I highly suggest it. It's extremely good.

mead,36ilig,matthewistre,2,Tue May 19 19:53:28 2015 UTC,2lbs peach 1.5lbs cherry. I like to put a lit of fruit. It comes out very good. Thats with a 2 gallon brew.
mead,36i80t,soingee,7,Tue May 19 16:05:42 2015 UTC,Should be totally fine as long as the only ingredient is honey. Pasteurization only kills the wild yeast in honey and slows down crystallization. It shouldn't in any way prevent a newly introduced yeast from going to town.
mead,36i80t,Nny12345,7,Tue May 19 16:50:39 2015 UTC,"Pasteurization and filtering won't hinder the fermentation process. Neither one adds anything to the honey that will hurt the yeast you pitch.  Cider is different, as many commercial fruit juices have sorbates and other preservatives, made specifically to hurt or kill microorganisms (like bacteria, mold and yeast).  As others have already said, honey doesn't usually have preservatives (in fact, I've never seen a honey that did) as honey's natural properties inhibit the growth of microorganisms.   I've made mead with Kirkland (costco) honey. I've made mead with the honey in the little bears from Target. I've made mead with bulk honey from Whole Foods.  As long as what you're getting is actually honey (and not fake honey), it should ferment up fine.  The only thing you lose with filtration and pasteurization are some of the subtle aromatics that you can get from raw honey. It's not a deal killer."
mead,36i80t,tinwhistler,6,Tue May 19 17:17:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, it will ferment. Honey doesn't go ""bad"" due to a number of factors. It can degrade in quality, but it doesn't go bad. Stabilizers aren't used in honey for a number of reasons. Aside from the fact it's unnecessary, you'd have to heat the honey beyond pasteurization temperature to make it viscous enough to stir-in stabilizers uniformly, and if you're at pasteurization temps, there's no longer a need for stabilizers.  When honey producers filter/pasteurize/process, they are doing so primarily for appearance and to minimize crystallization which originates around imperfections in some some honeys. The reason why mead makers preferred unprocessed honeys is because the volatiles in honey are responsible for a lot of the delicate character in mead, and processing can remove and/or degrade a lot of those volatiles.  The main thing you'll want to look for in selecting a honey is that it is actually 100% honey. The market has been getting flooded recently with Chinese ""honey"". These honeys are usually filtered to remove pollen. When pollen is removed from honey, the origin can't be identified in labs. There is a substantial tariff on honey in the US. Chinese honey producers used to export to Europe because of this, but Chinese honey is now prohibited in Europe due to concerns over heavy metals content. Removing the pollen allows manufacturers to buy Chinese honey at a heavy discount to ""cut"" their stateside honey and increase per-unit profitability. Because the pollen is removed, it is difficult to identify. A number of honey producers, many of the big names included, have had their products called into question. Be careful of this. The more local and unprocessed you can get, the safer you are.  EDITED to include sources:  http://guardianlv.com/2014/02/honey-in-the-bank-china-exports-bogus-honey-to-us/  http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/08/honey-laundering/  While I haven't used their honey personally, Dutch Gold is well-regarded in forums. Their prices are also reasonable from what I understand. This would be a good route to go. Dutch Gold, as I understand it, is raw, unprocessed, and unpasteurized.    Bottom line: Will my A&P brand clover honey make mead?   It will ferment, and it will make mead. It's just a question of quality. I'm not familiar with A&P, so I can't comment on their product. Rule of thumb is that if the honey tastes decent, it should produce a decent mead."
mead,36i80t,bailtail,3,Tue May 19 17:52:25 2015 UTC,"I've used some ""Value time"" honey before. I'm not sure how widely spread the brand is, but it's essentially the worst of the worst. It still ferments fine, maybe it doesn't have as strong of a honey taste when all is said and done, but that also might just be because of the champagne yeast I used with it."
mead,36i80t,Alcoholic_Autonomous,3,Tue May 19 17:05:34 2015 UTC,"A tip I've been given by a beekeeper to find out if no sugar or something has been added to the honey is to take a sample of honey on a stick and burn it shortly. If it continues to burn into a stinky black mass after removing the flame there is something else than honey in there. If it just caramelises slowly into a darker coffee color, it's probably pure honey."

mead,36i80t,BoogerTom,2,Tue May 19 17:24:28 2015 UTC,"Absolutely fine. honey rarely if ever has preservatives added, so as long as it's entirely honey (not added sugar syrups or whatnot - I have heard that sort of thing can be a problem in the US where they have weaker food standards laws than here in the EU) it'll be fine. If you are going to backsweeten it may be worth splurging on some really nice honey as that will make a larger difference to the final flavour."
mead,36i80t,azithel,1 point,Tue May 19 17:43:26 2015 UTC,"Taking a stab, but I would think that the pasteurisation problem would be that it kills natural yeasts, so a successful fermentation would depend on if you are adding external yeasts to the mead or are relying on the natural yeasts in the honey to ferment the sugars. I think this is more of an issue in cider making where it is more common to use the natural yeasts present to ferment."

Also, I recommend supporting beekeepers because I am one (hence, my comment about being biased).  If you continue to do the easy/cheap thing and support the businesses and industries that exploit the bees to the extent that has created Colony Collapses Disorder, we may just find ourselves without any bees or the wonderful source of nutrition that they supply."

Its not fair to say store honey is bad, when there are many good ones to choose from. Costco honey is very good for meads, especially their bulk ones.  And to be honest seeing the prices honey can command, and the continued increased demand for mead, I am not concerned about bee keepers going under any time soon."
mead,36i80t,DroneCell,-6,Tue May 19 23:10:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe make friends with a positive attitude instead of a negative one and you will find a friendly apiary willing to play nice. It is completely fair to say that store bought honey is bad, when in comparison with raw honey. Your correct in saying that not all honey from a shelf is bad (pasteurized or micro filtered), but when buying big box store honey your promoting an industry that is hurting your own. I believe OPs question was will it work, which was answered. From my POV, I have a pile of raw, local honey that is gifted to me to make mead with because I immersed myself in the culture. More honey than I have time to ferment. I'm sure my POV will probably change at some point when times are more tough, but until then, I can promote my method with full gusto. PS - contrary to your response, depending on how much money your raw and local honey commands, your local beekeeper is not getting rich... To assume your being ripped off is asinine when you have no idea the costs involved in the hobby."
mead,36i80t,I_ABUSED_YOUR_CHAIR,4,Tue May 19 23:25:35 2015 UTC,"Ok, that was rude, and that I do downvote for. This sub is too small for name calling. FWIW I keep 2 hives for a friend. I know what it costs, and I do buy local when I am in the Twin Cities. Especially for aroma there are differences that are very clear in the final product if good care is taken during with more exotic varietal honeys.   There is a reason honey is expensive, especially if you are only getting about 30 lbs per hive. The issue is I live in a VERY remote area and there is only one apiary within about 200 miles to the best of my knowledge, and that one is 50 miles away. Local meads cost over $25 for a half size bottle of wine, and the best deal I can get on honey is $6/lb for bloody wildflower. And frankly I don't care if my honey is from Brazil, or from down the street. I care about quality and price, and when it comes to honey I can tell if I am getting the shaft on either, because I am in fact familiar with beekeeping.   Edit: Yeah, I just checked. There are only 2 apiaries in the UP that can produce more than 300 pounds annually."
mead,36i80t,StormBeforeDawn,-1,Wed May 20 01:10:26 2015 UTC,"If you keep and invest in bees, I commend you. Sounds like there is quite the gap in your local market, perhaps you could step in and make a killing by ""gouging"" a little less than your neighboring apiaries. Instead of complaining about the practices of others, you could be the change you wish to see in the world. Afterthought, I did no name calling. Although, I did define my opinion of situation that apparently doesn't apply to you."

mead,36fg0q,Ehxdi,1 point,Mon May 18 23:41:31 2015 UTC,"all of those sugars are fermentable, so S-04 will most likely take it completely dry (assuming a healthy fermentation, etc). you're gonna have to stabilize and backsweeten after fermentation is complete to get it as sweet as you're looking for.   you said you're using the fruit as a nutrient source, but be aware that amount of fruit is only going to contribute a mild fruit/wine character. even 120g/L (1 pound per gallon) is usually still mild.  without the 1kg of sugar, you're probably going to end up with a starting gravity of around 1.050 for an abv of around 6.6% (assuming a total volume of 20L). the 1kg of sugar will boost you to around 1.067 and 9.1% abv. the sugar isn't going to taste ""sugary"" though- it will ferment completely and won't leave much flavor behind.   also, with S-04 be sure to keep your fermentation temperature between 15C and 20C, otherwise you're at risk of getting off flavors."
mead,36fg0q,naudir,1 point,Tue May 19 00:20:44 2015 UTC,"I don't really mind the mild fruit character, what type of stabilization method would work or what type of back-sweetening would be the most accessible ?"
mead,36fg0q,naudir,1 point,Tue May 19 08:07:01 2015 UTC,"you have a few choices:  1) use 2.5tsp potassium sorbate in 19L total volume (to prevent the yeast from reproducing) and 0.25tsp potassium metabisulfite (to prevent bacterial spoilage). then you can add as much honey or sugar (or fruit, maple syrup, etc) as you want without fermentation restarting.  2) forget about stabilizing and just keep adding fermentable sugars (honey, fruit, sugar, maple syrup, etc) until the yeast reach their alcohol tolerance (you will end up with a very alcoholic mead).  3) forget about stabilizing and just backsweeten using non-fermentable sugars (e.g. lactose)."

mead,36fg0q,Sayurifujisan,2,Tue May 19 19:59:28 2015 UTC,"Well, fermented corn sugar really tastes like ass.   It's all about the gravity as far as apparent sweetness goes. With 4 kg it should come out about right with the adtl. fruit you have. This is only true for a 15 L liquid volume. Fruit wines are harder to get accurate math for because of the space the fruit takes up. Your yeast goes to 8 or 8.5% (google this next time on your own) so with your 4kg in 15L total volume ( again, excluding fruit volume) you have a potential ABV of 10.7% (1.08SG), and higher with the fruit. Lets say we want a final gravity of 1.02. This is a little sweet, and with the sugars from the fruit, it's a touch sweeter too. A Delta of .06 is 8.21% ABV, around your yeast tolerance.   TLDR, add 4kg honey and water to 15L, then add fruit. Ferment and it will be sweet. 3.5kg would be drier. Maybe. This really isn't a wine yeast in the first place, and I am not familiar with it."
mead,36fg0q,Sayurifujisan,1 point,Tue May 19 22:43:41 2015 UTC,"I used the calculator, but the target value was about 20L.I was reckoning that the 4k honey would not influence the Target value, but considering what you just said, I was probably wrong.  In regards to the yeast itself, it's a dark Ale Yeast, fairly common- from what I've read was about 10% (with some effort) on tolerance. I asked here because I wanted to be sure."

mead,36damb,EbNinja,1 point,Mon May 18 19:48:26 2015 UTC,"I would add the yeast energizer now, just to get the fermentation kicking along. Take a reading now too, just so you have some numbers to work with.   The energizer is generally for getting a dry yeast culture started (or I might have the nutrient and energizer switched...).  Basically you need to let the yeast do it's job for a while, say... a couple weeks. Then, you will need to transfer it into another carboy for a few more to age/mellow off the yeast.  Hope that helps a bit, and the other Meadditors have better sage advice than me .^"
mead,36damb,new-Baltimoreon,1 point,Mon May 18 14:25:00 2015 UTC,"typically when someone asks for help around here, it helps a lot if you give us as much as possible of the following information:   how much honey did you use, and what flavor/type is it (clover, wildflower, tupelo etc.) what yeast did you use  how did you prepare that yeast before you pitched it into the Must what (if any) yeast nutrients or brewing additives have you added or have on hand. what (if any) other flavoring ingredients did you use what Gravity (""O.G."" probably something between 1.080 - 1.140) or Brix (Bx, probably between 19 - 33) reading did you start with, and what is the current (or last) reading. how long has it been fermenting (or since you pitched the yeast) what temperature is it? what type of container is it in? (bucket/carboy, plastic/glass)   I know this seems like a lot of information, and some of it can be challenging or confusing for someone who hasn't done this before, but the more detailed you are in your description, the more complete picture we have to start helping you."
mead,36damb,new-Baltimoreon,3,Mon May 18 14:56:47 2015 UTC,"/u/metronos I am going to give you advice based on the following:   1 Gallon total volume in a glass carboy. I will assume you used 3Lbs of honey, and that your gravity was somewhere around 1.110 or 26 Brix. with a potential for about 14.5% ABV I will also assume that your gravity is probably down to about 1.060, which would give you a current ABV of around 7%, which is totally just a guess as there are many factors that would effect this.  other than the coffee & honey, you did not list any other ingredients you used, so I will assume that you didn't put anything else in there. you mentioned that your kit came with camden & K-sorbate, and that you bought ""nutrient & energizer"", I will assume that they're L.D. Carlson, and that the nutrient is white granules of Diamonium Phosphate (DAP), and the energizer is a brown/tan powder with flex of white granules of DAP. I also assume that you have some kind of sanitizer like Star-San, and are willing to sanitize everything that might potentially touch your mead, or anything that touches something that touches your mead. if you don't, you really should, that stuff is awesome and super easy to use.     I would recommend one of the two following courses of action:  Option #1: Do nothing. If it's been bubbling for a week and smells alright, it's probably ok. let it run it's course, and when it stops fermenting, let it clear a bit, then rack off any sediment, and let it clear more, in about 3 months when you can see through it (or shine a flashlight through it and you don't see murkyness), rack again take a gravity reading and then give it a week to rest, check the gravity again. if there's no gravity change between the readings, it's totally done and it's time to bottle.  Option #2: if you decide not to go with option 1, then I would add 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon of the yeast energizer using the following process.   gently degas the must by gently agitating the carboy and allowing the dissolved CO2 to gently come out of suspension (did I mention gently?) you are trying to get the mixture to go flat without adding too much oxygen back into it. pull a sample to take a gravity reading, write that gravity down somewhere and tell us what it is. pour the gravity sample into a sanitized cup or small mixing bowl, add the 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon of energizer and stir until it has fully dissolved and there are no crystals or dry clumps left. gently re-introduce the 'energized' mixture back into the carboy, careful to avoid splashing or otherwise oxygenating the must.   after this, you can go back to following option #1: let it run it's course, and when it stops fermenting, let it clear a bit, then rack off any sediment, and let it clear more, in about 3 months when you can see through it (or shine a flashlight through it and you don't see murkyness), rack again take a gravity reading and then give it a week to rest, check the gravity again. if there's no gravity change between the readings, it's totally done and it's time to bottle.  I am sure someone on here will disagree with me about using Energizer for option 2, but that's part of life.   edit: sorry, didn't see your response before I posted this, kept getting distracted at work while I typed it up."

mead,36cz5a,Aurimass,4,Mon May 18 11:54:08 2015 UTC,"There are a few ways you can do this:   Since you've made beer before, I assume you're familiar with how specific gravity works. Use a calculator, like the one in the sidebar, and figure out how much honey you would need to be left with 1.010-1.020 after you've hit your yeast's alcohol tolerance. If your yeasties prove tougher than anticipated, refer to method 3. Use an ale yeast or something like Wyeast Sweet Mead. These should leave a bit out sugar behind. Let it ferment all the way out, then feed more honey repeatedly until your yeast gives up. Fermentation stopping agents. Don't know much about this, I'm afraid.   Regarding nutrients, /u/balathustrius is your man."
mead,36cz5a,DeathtoPants,2,Mon May 18 12:23:31 2015 UTC,Are there any off-flavors associated with step feeding the yeast past its alcohol tolerance?
mead,36cz5a,zofoandrew,1 point,Mon May 18 13:44:06 2015 UTC,The only thing I hear about is taking forever to clear. Step feeding is actually preferred at higher abv meads since too high sugar concentration puts a lot of stress on the yeast.

At 1-2 months I'd expect what I am seeing in your pic, frankly.  Having said that, some things  just don't want to clear.  I have a 6 month old traditional batch I should be bottling but decided to use some Sparkolloid yesterday and let it go a few more weeks at least.

If it's not clear in 6 months total you may want to look into clarifying agents."
mead,36a4co,balathustrius,1 point,Sun May 17 20:51:41 2015 UTC,"My rule of thumb is to let my meads sit a minimum of three months in secondary. Even if it clears earlier, it's good to let it bulk age a bit before bottling. If the mead is clear after three months, I'll bottle at that time. If it hasn't cleared adequately, I'll let it sit anywhere from 1-3 months longer depending on how badly I need the carboys freed-up. If the mead doesn't clear by that time, I'll resort to fining agents. I prefer Super Kleer K.C., though I've seen positive reviews on bentonite and gelatin, as well."

mead,368yug,cmrncstn,6,Sun May 17 09:27:57 2015 UTC,"Had a fun idea to do a small batch series of what I will dub fresh mead. For shits and grins I'm laying down several fresh batches that I want to be consumed quickly within 30 to 45 days from brewday. In the past I've always let my meads sit, secondary, and cellar in I suppose what is a traditional way. Long story short I am a normal human being and become irrational and impatient at times. I have drunk many that were immature over the years and always wonder what could have been. So I said fuck it and tweaked and toyed with a few of my techniques and procedures, played with some atypical yeasts, and failed a few times. However I have become satisfied with this method now to unleash this first one after 30 days. Central Texas wildflower honey. 45 minute, 1 gallon batch, hanging at 13%, crystal clear, sweet, tart, bold, and medium bodied. The next three batches coming up to a month old are prickly pear (a classic standard recipe of mine), Dewberry, and a very light bing cherry sparkler already laid down in bottles.   TL; DR Glad I found this sub."
mead,368yug,bogusputz,8,Sun May 17 09:50:30 2015 UTC,Are you willing to share some of the techniques and yeasts you used for this if not I understand but will expect an invite to come out for samples.
mead,368yug,bailtail,3,Sun May 17 12:41:46 2015 UTC,Most of my techniques I rethought in ways to save time and have same results.   Doing one gallon batches on a stove top for instance only takes me like half an hour to get the must ready because I measure out and do all the legwork first so when it comes off the stove I basically have the gallon jug ready with my cold water to add hot must to so I can pretty much pitch yeast immediately. I keep a starter constantly going for both still and sparkling. I'm playing with different strains for still right now but have fallen in love with the lavlin ec1118 sparkling wine yeast. I'll do the initial pitch then pitch another half unit 7 to 10 days later which makes the finishing time much much shorter and then like 10 to 15 days in the bottle to carb up. So little steps ahead of time shorten brewday greatly. And aggressive yeast strains used liberally shorten fermentation. Kinda flying by the seat of my pants with this project but it doesn't hurt as much to fuck up a gallon instead of five or six. Mead on buddy!
mead,368yug,bailtail,2,Sun May 17 17:08:04 2015 UTC,"fallen in love with the lavlin ec1118 sparkling wine yeast.   This surprised me. EC1118 is one of my least preferred yeasts for mead. If the goal is to have a low-ish ABV mead with minimal aging requirements, 1118 seems particularly poorly suited. What other yeasts have you tried? What is it about 1118 that you're so fond of?"
mead,3696cd,Scorp63,2,Sun May 17 11:43:05 2015 UTC,"Ok, I just finished making a much larger batch of a chocolate mead myself, so I'm in a pretty good place to comment on this one.  The chocolate fallout is normal.  You won't get the powder to stay suspended like you were thinking.  Even if you leave it in milk, over time the powder would fall out of suspension.    As for the taste, you probably didn't use enough powder to get a good chocolate taste with only 5-6 tbsp.  For a good strong chocolate taste using powder, you would really want to use about 6-8 oz per gallon.  When I did my 5 gal batch, I actually used @36oz of powder.  That gave me a pretty good chocolate taste that stayed strong after 2 rackings and then bottling.  If you want to use cocoa nibs in the secondary, you can do that, but I would also recommend getting a fresh vanilla bean as well, since the actual chocolate flavor you are really asking about that most people associate with chocolate is a mixture of the vanilla and cocoa tastes together.  I would put 2 nibs and 1 bean in the secondary, and then do a small taste test every few days until you get around the flavor you are looking for.  (Put a straw in there, do a small sip/thumb over the end of the straw and taste a bit).  Once it hits the taste you are looking for, take out/rack off the nibs/bean, and then let it age for a little while longer.    Let us know how it turns out :)"
mead,3696cd,Banluil,1 point,Sun May 17 12:42:41 2015 UTC,"Vanilla would definitely be a great addition. So cocoa powder will still add chocolate flavor even if it falls out of suspension? I'm also surprised about the cocoa nibs; I'd read where you could use a whole pound, but you're saying only use two little nibs? I've also seen some say ~1oz/gallon. If the cocoa powder will add the flavor though, then I'll probably stick with that, but I assumed it wouldn't out of suspension (admittedly I know nothing)."
mead,3696cd,Banluil,1 point,Sun May 17 18:13:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, forgive the nibs part, I was still asleep when I read that part of it...and I'm allowed to make mistakes when I haven't had my coffee yet :)    You would want quite a bit more nibs than just the couple I was saying, but it would still be cheaper, and IMO better since you started out with the powder to just continue with that.  I would just add some more powder to it, let it sit until that drops out of suspension.  By that time you should have a nice chocolaty color to it.  The one I just finished isn't the clear that you can read a newspaper through, but it is more like the clear of a good heavy red style beer.  That would be what you are looking for, clear enough to see through, but not the typical golden mead color either.  Good luck :)  Remember, you still have to drink all your mistakes since this is mead making :)  EDIT  Also, for next time, I would probably recommend nesquick powder.  I have saved somewhere (and I will find it and link it) where someone did a number of different comparasions of different chocolate flavorings for mead, and the one they enjoyed the most was the NesQuick.  I used that and I have had some of my regular mead drinking people begging for me to put it on my list to make on a regular basis."

mead,3696cd,Banluil,1 point,Mon May 18 17:31:41 2015 UTC,"Yep, that was the thread.  That is why I used a lower amount of honey, to compensate for the extra sugar content of the nesquick."

mead,3696cd,bailtail,1 point,Mon May 18 01:55:20 2015 UTC,"Really? The reading I've done on chocolate meads has nibs being far and away the superior method with cocoa powder requiring much longer aging periods for the bitterness to fade (on top of the messiness factor). I've played around with both on the small scale and found nibs far superior, as well. I had no problem with the oils. The nibs give off very little, and the little that is given off tended to be left behind on the walls of my primary bucket during the racking process."

mead,3696cd,bailtail,1 point,Wed May 20 22:37:57 2015 UTC,"Good question. I'd have to look back at my notes. I can't do that at the moment as I'm currently in China for work. I took a quick glance around the web, though, and I'd recommend starting at  3 or 4 oz/gal. Most recipes appear to be in the 4 to 8 oz/gal range, but seeing as you already used some cocoa, I'd stay on the conservative end of that range. You can always add more later if you'd like.  My recommendation on how to use them would be to spray the nibs and a couple split vanilla beans down with vodka, toss them in a nylon/mesh brew bag (you can skip this, but it helps with clean-up), and toss them in your fermenter. You can take a taste sample every couple weeks and remove when satisfied if you'd like, but I've found that the nibs lose their potency with time and as long as you don't overdo the dosing amount, there's no harm in just leaving the nibs in there."

mead,366ugi,bailtail,1 point,Tue May 19 01:36:05 2015 UTC,"It's actually really interesting, depending on the concentration of must I used the flavor profiles for mine have been vastly different.   Lower concentrations of must yield a more aromatic, floral flavor that hits the tip of your tongue with flavor but then dissipates.   Higher concentrations yield deeper more complex flavors like black licorice and anise; these flavors really don't hit for a moment but then really linger.  A blend of both ends up with what I can really only describe as full bodied. It has light floral tones upfront that then fade into deep long lasting more complex flavors."

I always prefer buying from greenmarkets.   This post was more for my own knowledge, and if anyone else happens to see it at their local Costco or whatever and were curious."
mead,36795k,FrankiePoops,1 point,Mon May 18 16:53:19 2015 UTC,Good deal. Anything new in their honey selection recently? The 60#er that I got (and lugged back on the subway) was their summer floral which I love.
mead,3664pg,glickipedia,3,Sat May 16 14:54:31 2015 UTC,"Actually, my buddy went down there and found quite a few local meads that he really enjoyed. I didn't get to try any but you might see if you can find any."
mead,3664pg,FrankiePoops,2,Sat May 16 15:15:53 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll keep an eye out.
mead,3664pg,that_saucy_sloth,2,Sat May 16 15:21:51 2015 UTC,"I looked up customs limitations and picked up some local honey from farmers markets. But I must have pissed someone off, because the lids were opened and the honey was dumped in my luggage. Not broken (glass was intact) but actually intentionality dumped. Very disappointing."
mead,3664pg,lostarchitect,1 point,Sat May 16 16:03:06 2015 UTC,Are you sure the pressure change didn't pop the lids?
mead,3664pg,that_saucy_sloth,1 point,Sat May 16 19:10:28 2015 UTC,"Can't be positive, but the lids were mason jars and on the other side of the bag. They're not designed for outward pressure, so I'd think they'd rupture before the lids would pop."
mead,365l24,Olityo,4,Sat May 16 10:31:25 2015 UTC,"Popular fruits and berries to add, making it a melomel include: raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, cherries, mango, peach, plum, apricot, and strawberry to name some. Feel free to mix and mash to get some fun flavor combinations.  Adding fruit to secondary will give you a taste truer to the fruit you added, as it will not be as thoroughly fermented. This is totally up to taste--some like their melomels with a fruity taste, while others like their fruit tasting more like fermented fruit.  Adding fruit flavor to mead requires a lot of fruit, so you will not have enough room for five liters of mead along with a pound+ of fruit in a 5 liter demijohn. Consider doing either a smaller batch to fit it into your demijohn or do your fruit additions in a bucket, then siphon over to your demijohn for clearing and aging.   Honey does add to the total volume. Using the no-heat method, you can add some water, then your honey. You then dissolve the honey in the water and add the remaining water to get your total volume to the batch size you want.   Using tap water for mead is fine, as long as you would be fine drinking it straight from the tap. If your local tap water tastes like chemicals and chlorine, you will want to use bottled water.   For a dry mead, use 2.5 lbs/gal, medium sweet use 3 lbs/gal, and for a sweet mead, use 3.5 lbs/gal. Fruit additions will also add some sweetness, depending on how sweet what you are adding is. If you ferment it dry, add your fruit and then stabilize, you can back sweeten to make it as sweet as you like.   71b has a tolerance of 14%, and will leave the delicate fruity aromas alone, so this is an excellent yeast, well loved by many mazers. I use WLN1000 for my nutrients. As long as it is a yeast nutrient, it will be fine. Hell, even raisins will do the trick for you. An energizer kick starts the fermentation, but leaving it out will have no consequences. Lots of people do their meads without energizer.   A month in primary is a good number. You will not have to add any nutrients with fruit additions. They will get what they need (if any) from the fruit itself--same principle as the raisins as nutrients. To get more flavor from your fruit, consider freezing it and mashing it up a bit before you add it to your mead."
mead,365l24,JonasTorgersen,1 point,Sat May 16 11:56:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that helps a lot! How much water am I likely to need for two 5 litre demijohns with about a pound of fruit/berries then? Is 9 litres good or is that still too much?"
mead,365l24,JonasTorgersen,2,Sat May 16 12:18:44 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I've never done any fruit additions to a demijohn or carboy before, so unfortunately I can't help you. I stick to buckets much larger than my batch, where headspace and batch size become lesser concerns and fruit is much easier to remove afterwards."
mead,365l24,StormBeforeDawn,2,Sat May 16 12:35:51 2015 UTC,"10-20% headspace is good to shoot for. You can always add water if it needs a little volume later, although that will lower your ABV and potentially allow fermentation to restart."
mead,365l24,JonasTorgersen,1 point,Sun May 17 08:11:30 2015 UTC,"So since you say that you've used WLN1000; should I just follow the instructions for 1/2 tsp per 5 gallons? Because for my batch that would mean about 1/4 tsp, which seems like barely anything at all..."
mead,365l24,balathustrius,2,Fri May 22 08:46:06 2015 UTC,"Well the instructions are there for a reason.. I try to always follow instructions to a t, and I have yet to experience a malnutritioned batch. You'll be fine."

mead,3643v3,I_ABUSED_YOUR_CHAIR,1 point,Fri May 15 23:42:35 2015 UTC,Elderberry flower season is within a week away! If you quickly plan a brew you can make elderblossom mead. I've already got the honey for mine. Still doubting between making syrup and adding that to the mead or putting the raw flowers in the mead.
mead,3643v3,Laureril,3,Sat May 16 12:27:39 2015 UTC,"If you want to try something a little different, dig up the taproot - you can actually brew it for a coffee-like beverage."
mead,364zi7,Cabrill,9,Sat May 16 04:51:25 2015 UTC,Looks like yeast to me.
mead,364zi7,MrButters,3,Sat May 16 05:28:24 2015 UTC,"I decided to go big on my first attempt at mead, and made 25 gallons in seven different varieties in May of 2014.  Except for this questional specimen they all turned out well, and bottling day is tomorrow.  This is 1 of 2 gallons made for this flavor, except one is blackberry and looks perfectly clear, but this one is the strawberry variant.  My question is whether this mead is dangerous to taste test, or not?  Here is the recipe and my history of notes:  Pear, Strawberry & Pineapple Melomel @ 2 gallons    All Ingredients: 1 packet Lalvin ICV-D47 5 lbs honey (2 more lbs of honey added in secondary, for a total of 7 lbs honey) 2 gallons spring water 1/2 fresh pineapple core 5 lbs. pears (1/2 in primary, 1/2 in secondary) 1/2 lb strawberries 1 tsp pectin enzyme 0.5 tsp yeast energizer (another 0.5 tsp at 1/3 sugar break, and another at 2/3 sugar break) 3/4 tsp yeast nutrient (another 1 tsp at 1/3 sugar break, and another at 2/3 sugar break) 3/4 tsp potassium carbonate    Secondary: Juice of two limes, pulp of six 1lb of blackberries, 1.5lbs of strawberries    TOO CHUNKY TO MEASURE (next time use a filter for pulling sample) starting SG ?? = ?? PABV    Placed in 3g glass carboy on 5/24/2014    5/24/2014 10pm - ???   (overflowed multiple times, filling up the airlock with kroisin.  Had to use doubled up paper towel for 8~ hours) 5/25/2014 11pm - 1.060 (assumed past 1/3rd sugar break. added .5tsp energizer & .75 tsp nutrient.  Very prone to overflow still) 5/26/2014 11pm - 1.022 (past 2/3 sugar break!  Added .5 tsp energizer & 3/4 tsp nutrient) 6/09/2014 11pm - Combined both gallons into one.  Added 0.5lb blackberries to one carboy and 0.5lb straberries to the other. Juice of one lime and pulp from three to each.  Racked back onto new fruit. Topped off with 1 lb of pure honey each. 6/14/2014 10pm - Strawberries had gone white.  Replaced with 0.5lb of fresh strawberries from garden. 6/23/2014 11pm - Added 0.5lb of strawberries to one and 0.25lb of blackberries to the other. 7/7/2014 10pm - Racked both flavors off lees separately, and then returned to 1gal carboys with .15oz of medium toasted hungarian oak chips.  Topped off with white wine and glass marbles (more marbles in blackberry than strawberry). 2/6/2015 10pm - N/A - Used a coat hanger to remove the toasted oak.  32 total weeks on the oak, badly over-oaked."
mead,364zi7,Jack_shriker,2,Sat May 16 04:52:29 2015 UTC,"That's what mine look like whenever I put cinnamon in.  I didn't see that on your list.  I've not done oak, but it could be from that.  Honestly, I'd just smell it.  If it's infected it should smell infected.  If it doesn't smell horrible give it a try."
