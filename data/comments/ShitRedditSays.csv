Paula Deen admitted to using the N-word in her own home after a Black man put a gun to her head when she was working as a bank teller. It didn't matter that she was in a state of shock after almost being murdered, or that this was in the 60's in the South, or that she said it in the privacy of her own home. She was publicly crucified as a racist because she used a word that White people are forbidden to use. She broke the code. She broke the linguistic segregation that is put in place, and she paid the price for it.  This happens all the time for White people. Rick Sanchez made a comment about Jon Stewart's ethnicity, in which he brought up the fact that many of the big Media owners are Jewish. He didn't bring it up out of nowhere-- Jon Stewart was implying that he faced hardship in life because of his Jewishness, and Sanchez mentioned that being Jewish could only make it easier to break into media work. Is it true that most people in media management positions are Jewish? I mean, undoubtedly, it is absolutely true, and this is due to a cultural history of Jews emigrating during and after WWII. Nothing racist was implied in the least. But he broke the segregation of speech. He broke the code. He was fired promptly after making the comment. Silly White guy. Silly honky.   No one really cares, though. It's alarming.   I remember when Jon Stewart was covering the Muslim woman who wasn't given part of her soda can on a plane. It was a tragedy-- at least according to Stewart. How could such unprovoked racism exist, taking the rightful bottle cap away from its owner on a plane? What a travesty. Of course, that same week a Black man attacked a random White woman by slashing her neck just blocks away from where Stewart films. It was a completely unprovoked attack. It was calculated.  Ah, but to say anything would break the segregation. No one is allowed to talk about it. That would be racist, you racist.

The same babies that cry about ethics in video games don't care about ethics in pornography for some reason (it's women? they don't care about ethics? this website is a misogynist shithole?).

ShitRedditSays,3e2omr,ttumblrbots,12,Tue Jul 21 16:14:05 2015 UTC,"Rape culture isn't real, according to reddit dot com, yet redditors scrutinize rape victims, engage in victim blaming and put rapists and molestors up on a pedestal to be adored and worshiped. Rape jokes and jokes belittling those who survive such ordeals are routinely passed around like candy. Redditors have no doubt in their mind that it is not rape but false rape accusations that is the real problem and that those they assume are falsely accused of rape are the real victims, never mind the countless numbers of actual rape and sexual assault victims. Those people don't matter. They're all fake.  At this point, I don't think reddit is ignorant of rape culture. I think reddit is actively complicit and is knowingly perpetuating it. They might not call it ""rape culture"". They might say it's just ""healthy skepticism"" of victims or just viewing rapists with an ""objective lens"" but it's perpetuating rape culture nonetheless."

Growing up in my affluent white district, the affluent white kids had no problems getting entry level jobs in nice restaurants with zero experience. I doubt they hired one minority student but they take on white kids with no experience with no issue. I've seen this shit happen before my own eyes. Two kids: one white, one POC. Guess who gets the job? News fucking flash: the white kid.   But this goes beyond getting entry level jobs, it extends into every part of life. You could be 10x more experienced and the white candidate would get picked because they're too afraid of your name sounding too ""black."" You could complete a degree in microbiology at Harvard University and people will still question your credentials. ""Black and going to Ivy League?

ShitRedditSays,3dy07l,Bizznet,66,Mon Jul 20 22:26:46 2015 UTC,"Reddit Law School, everyone.  4% of sexual assault reports (here in Canada) are actually false reports, and only a tiny percentage of that small percentage are reports filed maliciously. The rest are cases of mistaken identity, in which the person was actually sexually assaulted. So reddit seems to think that in order to combat an already small fraction of sexual assault reports, we need to make it even worse for people to file reports.  Is this going to affect someone who has been sexually assaulted but had mistaken the person's identity? Or what if there was limited to no physical evidence? What if it happened years before and the victim wanted to press charges? Not every false report is a malicious one, and something tells me these asswipes don't even really care.  Reddit not only wants to put rape accusers in jail, but to effectively ruin their finances and social ties forever, thereby creating an imbalance in which you can be punished way more severely for even coming forward, than the actual offender themselves.  Fucking bravo, Reddit. Proving once again that you actually hate women who speak up about being sexually assaulted."
ShitRedditSays,3dy07l,send-me-to-hell,12,Mon Jul 20 19:01:14 2015 UTC,"So reddit seems to think that in order to combat an already small fraction of sexual assault reports, we need to make it even worse for people to file reports.   At the risk of sounding like a doo-doo head I don't think this would make things worse in an objective way since the courts would need a separate trial and an equally sized burden of proof for the accuser. Regardless of what reddit thinks an acquittal actually means. So the only way you can get nailed for falsely accusing someone of rape is if they can somehow prove beyond a reasonable doubt you were lying versus simply unable to prove your case. If that were the only facet of this it would probably be the redditor not understanding how the justice system is supposed to work.  The real problem here is that it could be perceived by victims as something that can come back onto them if they can't prove their claim. So many people assume acquittal somehow means ""innocent"" which ignores that an acquittal is pretty much what courts do by default, ""Innocent until proven guilty.""   Making a big show of punishing false accusations could silence legitimate victims. The person linked in the OP just apparently doesn't care enough to consider that perspective simply because they're free not to do so.   Not every false report is a malicious one, and something tells me these asswipes don't even really care.   Oh no they do care, it's just that one of these things could potentially affect them so they concentrate on that. Mostly on account that they're self-centered children in adult bodies."

ShitRedditSays,3dv1sj,cblname,15,Mon Jul 20 06:25:34 2015 UTC,"Some woeful gems in there. Every straw feminist argument is crawling out of the networks for this parade today.   Something needs to be done to stop people getting away with this.   Like perjury ?  Like getting willingly imprisoned for grossly abusing the system never happens and people do this for shits and giggles and go back to watching their tv like nothing happened. You think this is how life works? Is this your 'professional' observation from your basement, dear Dorito-encrusted, Mountain-Dew-stained, redditor?   I love how there's a stack of people with anecdotes of their brother's father's second cousin got accused. Thathappened.txt is getting thrown around in there like it's a new hat. Especially considering majority of rapists are of men who don't actually understand what consent is and don't associate their often twisted idea of sex with rape and view rape itself as a controversial subject. But I'll bet all these guys recalling these stories have a very personal, professional in depth knowledge of each case and person involved and can extract the truth of it all in one whisper like a gifted criminal lawyer.  Oh here's a gross one:    he's getting charged either way. He is getting charged. Being charged with rape is now a foregone conclusion. He is going to jail/committing suicide no matter what now   So naturally he should just forego his own moral basics to agree with this guy's outrage. Cuz all guys must think bout rape as much as this guy, enjoy it and why not just do it? Just fuckit. Cuz all guys secretly want to enjoy it.which is what rapists actually believe   So now you understanding he will be taking the fall, (understanding his decision is only affecting his own morality, and possible parole if he has the money and the lawyer to appeal). If he is going to jail for the crime, his understanding is that he might as well inflict the crime upon her (a terrible person anyways if that makes you feel at all better), if he is going to jail for it.   ""I add disclaimers to hide I'm a deadshit but he should totally rape her""   To be clear, if you were a bystander in this situation, you think he is a rapist either way, just because he himself knows he didn't do it does jack shit for him.   ""I'm going to insert what everyone does based on my own fears of society justifying pre-emptively being a rapist. It all makes sense...in my head""    and from a different perspective, him raping her (while still a terrible, terrible thing) won't get him in any worse of a situation (if he were to indeed kill himself). And following this logic, he is given the strange chance to experience raping someone without undo consequences.   ""Strange""???  Not horrifying. Not disgusting. Not vomit inducing if say....you weren't a rapist and having it suggested you to rape.  Nonono. ""strange"" is this guy's go-to word on experiencing raping someone. Like it's a happy accident.    (its as if you paid for a drink in a supermarket, but didn't get said drink. (The paying of the drink=jail time and the drink=rape. Supermarket=world))   I like how he needs to spell out this shit metaphor.   Yeah dudebro. We get it. You think Rape is exactly like paying for a drink. Exactly. Just Like a drink.   Well I've not seen such a perfect exhibit to support the argument that It's not women. It's not feminists. It's not anyone else but rapists that say ""all men are rapists"" or ""all men should be rapists""."
ShitRedditSays,3dv1sj,ButWhyWouldYou,15,Mon Jul 20 06:28:45 2015 UTC,Rape is illegal. It always has been.

She was a homeless drug addict with a history of prostitution. She was living in his apartment and while she was in police custody the cell phone he gave her was blowing up with multiple johns asking to pay for sex.  He was, very very clearly, taking advantage of her.   Is the inconsistent testimony of a drug addict enough to convict someone of rape? Probably not. But that doesn't mean he didn't do it.  And he sure as fuck is a shitty person."

Then, it would be explained that minors and people with debilitating mental illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease are not able to give sexual consent.  All of this is easily accessible online, depending on what state you live in, just by Googling ""<state> sexual consent laws"", and it's usually written plainly and simply enough that even you could be able to figure out that sex with an unconscious drunk girl is rape."

Could it be that they're the sort of out-and-out lies that only survive in a pseudo-democratic echo chamber like Reddit?  But of course, they want to feel smart. They want someone to confirm that they truly understand the world in a way few have before. The white power crowd can give them that on multiple levels.

Never publicly but mostly when I've been venting to my boyfriend. I remember when I said one small quip that was so appalling  and absurd, my boyfriend burst out laughing and immediately felt awful for laughing. Honestly I hadn't laughed that hard in months.   Anyway, my therapist has called me out on this before. He's straight up said 'I see that smirk' or 'I know that smile'. I didn't joke, smile, and laugh about it because I was over it. I did it because I couldn't fucking cry. I did it because I didn't know how to deal with the fact a coward of a man raped me, nearly destroyed everything good in my life, and nearly pushed me to suicide.   I don't tell rape jokes because I know it can take someone's good day and drag it down to an awful one.  Also on a pure analysis of humor, I have never heard a rape joke that was funny. Seriously. It's either ""surprise! The shocking twist is rape!"" or ""it's ironic!"" which is FUCKING BORING. Don't try and compensate for your shitty lack of original humor by throwing rape in."

ShitRedditSays,3drzbh,c4a,3,Sat Jul 18 22:47:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure  if you're familiar with this response - better link inserted 'time machine: ""To all those who don't think the rape joke was a problem""' that had made it's rounds for several years now but it originated back in the penny arcade days on a topic regarding rape jokes. It had spurred quit a bit of viral response on rape jokes back in the day. I'm fairly certain it still does still pique interest of the more harder to relinquish 'comedians of rape jokes' to argue with.   One problem is how a rapist is defined. Rapists are ok with what they do so long as the 'r' word isn't used  And if that doesn't give you the heeby jeebies, it's sad to know that full on serial killer /rapists will even go as far as denying any incidences of rape  There was a conducted written survey among convicted rapists: deniers and admitters (convicted rapists wanted their true identity  hidden)  Written conclusion on study:   men raped because their value system provided no compelling reason not to do so. When sex is viewed as a male entitlement, rape is no longer seen as criminal. However, the deniers had been convicted of rape, and like the admitters, they attempted to negotiate an identity. Through justifications, they constructed a ""controversial"" rape and attempted to demonstrate how their behavior, even if not quite right, was appropriate in the situation. Their denials, drawn from common cultural rape stereotypes, took two forms, both of which ultimately denied the existence of a victim.  While admitters and deniers present an essentially contrasting view of men who rape, there were some shared characteristics. Justifications particularly, but also excuses, are buttressed by the cultural view of women as sexual commodities, dehumanized and devoid of autonomy and dignity. In this sense, the sexual objectification of women must be understood as an important factor contributing to an environment that trivializes, neutralizes, and, perhaps, facilitates rape.  From this small, atypical group of men, psychiatric findings have been generalized to all men who rape. Our research, however, based on volunteers from the entire prison population, indicates that some rapists, like deniers, viewed and understood their behavior from a popular cultural perspective. This strongly suggests that cultural perspectives, and not an idiosyncratic illness, motivated their behavior.    When it comes to normalizing rape, jokes go a long way in dehumanizing a victim and making a view seem popular because it is seen as funny. And considering at any given club, there will be a ""category 1"" hearing a controversial joke is saying: ""Yeah that's so true""  So I do stand corrected slightly as there is more than one type here: while there is a group that believe rape is normal that every man secretly does it( these would be your category 1 types seeking these rape jokes as encouragement), there is also a group that doesn't believe what they do is rape and that rape itself is a controversial topic. Whom I view as the more common 'dudebros' we see here on reddit which are feeding category 1 their source of assurance whilst enforcing poor views on women and victims of rape among the more wider culture view."

Let me introduce you to my modest proposal:  We do not ban a single sub. Nor do we make any of them ad free because we should not subsidize hate speech. Instead subs will be flagged as ""Hate Subs"" and hidden behind a popup wall much like NSFW subs are today, but instead when you click a link leading into a hate sub you will simply receive a popup asking:    The following sub has been flagged as a hate sub. Are you sure you would like to enter? Please type     asJknfiΩenÜwh938y98U(y72h into the box below if you are sure*.   *Note:Copying and pasting into the box will be disabled.   A positive response to this box will pull up another pop up asking:    Are you really sure? Take some time to think about it. Two minute countdown before yes button becomes available    A second positive response brings you into the subreddit proper. Clicking a link will then pull up an 5 minutes of unskippable fullscreen PSA's about the importance of equality and ending racism.  Finally you may see the link. Now if you'd like to comment, there are just a few hoops to go through but nothing too difficult. First a popup will come up asking:    Are you sure that you're really a shitty enough person to really post this?    A positive response brings up a second popup thats proceeds to read their comment back to them out loud. And then asks them if they are really ok with this after hearing it out loud.  A positive response here will then pull up a full screen image. And then reddit will automatically block their IP address and delete the account.   See, we don't need delete or these subs. We can just ban all the people commenting there. A perfect compromise."

When his mom was younger, she needed to go to a dentist to get a tooth removed. The only dentists in town wouldn't allow blacks to be patients. So like every other black person in the town who needed dentistry work done, she had to go to this one particular veterinarian who was the only person in town willing to have black patients. His condition though was that he feared that if his white customers found out he worked on black people they would no longer feel they could bring their dogs or cats in. So he required that his black patients use the back door and usually after hours to the veterinary office so that none of the white customers would see what he was doing and take their pets elsewhere.  That is something that happened to a real person, and while she's dead her son is still alive as are a great many people from that generation. This shit is not ancient history.

But that's a much longer explanation. And threats are almost never a crime, and a few months ago the Supreme Court just made online threats almost impossible to be considered a crime. But the constitution doesn't actually have any limits explicitly spelled out, it's the courts that have clarified times when free speech can be a crime (and there are very very few times when that is the case). Someone was making hundreds of facebook posts about how he wanted to kill his ex wife and rape her corpse and the Supreme Court said that's not a real threat because ""you can't prove causing emotional distress was the real point.""  /done serious  The reason why none of that's important though is this: reddit isn't a damn government.

Facebook is several orders of magnitude larger than reddit, but it bans certain kinds of things reddit does not. Facebook bans nudity, hate groups, and graphic content. Why has that not been a slippery slope for facebook?  Not to mention, that a government banning a thing means you can't do that thing. Germany banning lies about the holocaust means no one in Germany can legally lie about the holocaust. Facebook or Reddit banning a hate group does not stop you from joining that a hate group. You're still allowed to hate people, and create groups centered on your hate for other people, you're just not entitled to have your hate broadcasted using their private servers.  And the ultimate reason why this isn't a restriction of people's rights? Because reddit is replaceable. Other than Voat there are dozens of other alternatives. Not to mention that voat has put it's open source algorithem on gethub so that literally anyone can create their own reddit and run it however they want on their servers.  Reddit is a giant loud megaphone that reaches hundreds of millions. You do not have a right to use that megaphone however you want because it is their megaphone. If you don't like it, you're free to make your own megaphone or use someone else's but they are under no obligation to let you use it and no one's rights are being restricted by them saying so."

And of course this loops back around to them not feeling threatened and thus defending any threats made: Having never been directly threatened in a serious manner or even seriously attacked, they look at vicious attacks on other people and conclude the victims simply need a thicker skin."
ShitRedditSays,3doxgz,knife_missile,5,Sat Jul 18 03:46:57 2015 UTC,"Lucky you, law and government is one of my (458) favorite topics  From the First Amendment to the constitution (the first ten amendments are referred to as the Bill of Rights, btw):   Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.   so the constitutional right is literally just that government is never allowed to limit anyone's speech.  But there's two problems with settling for that and ceasing all the temper mantrums (yes that does mean I have to present the Redditeurs side in an unbiased light for a second):  First, the constitution was purposely made to be sort of vague by the Founding Fathers, who understood that the best way to make it relevant to an ever-changing society was to make the society of the time interpret it how it is relevant; that is why SCOTUS, whenever it clarifies the text via a ruling tries to limit the original text as little as possible.   Second, the idea is that the constitution and other important founding documents are only indicating deeper values that should be held by our country and everyone therein. In other words, the constitution could only talk about these values as they related to the government, but wanted them to be something every citizen and organization in our nation held dear. This argument is never explicitly stated by the Founders themselves, but does draw on enough evidence to seem valid.  Now back to our side of things: obviously point one doesn't really stand, as even though it is purposely vague, the constitution does specifically address a certain type of interaction: the government with the governed. It obviously doesn't apply to Reddit and it's users.  The second point stands though, but not necessarily as an absolute. Candidness may be painful or even downright cringeworthy at times, but it is important for human interactions. On the other hand, there is nothing wrong with having safe spaces set up where people can be free from abuse, denigration, and even microaggressions, which (the safety) can also foster deeper communication and interactions.  Finally, redditeurs don't realize that sometimes one right can (and should) preclude another--such as in the case of regulating hate speech--which as far as I'm aware is the only law that might violate free speech but has even been upheld by SCOTUS. They don't understand that absolute free speech doesn't mean absolute immunity from the repercussions thereof; they don't understand that there's nothing wrong with acting puzzled or incredulous at someone who interrupts a discussion about the economy to start talking about seafood in the culinary arts, and it's completely okay for a community to self-govern what kind of discussions it wants going on inside of it.  TL;DR Redditeurs talk about seafood too much, leadership is allergic, SRS agrees: ""they're too shellfish."""

Anyone invested enough to bother doing that just to read coontown is going to be farther out there than the average redditor. This account will enable them to comment elsewhere.

USA Today (bullshit that Ctown is mentioned but it's not explained what it is, at least it makes Spez look really wishy-washy towards the beginning of the article) - The discussion, which was held on Reddit's ""Ask Me Anything"" forum, did not offer an official guideline for what the website's content policy will look like under the new CEO. However, Huffman did outline suggestions for why certain posts should be banned, and parameters for what should be considered harassment....The Reddit community has been up in arms lately about how the site has dealt with certain content. The community reached a tipping point last month when Pao attempted to censor offensive and unruly groups (called subreddits), such as ones that were focused on the hatred of gay, black and overweight people.  CBS News (quotes Pao at length, mentions her harassment) - A highly trafficked racist subreddit called ""coontown,"" on the other hand, will be ""reclassified"" under the new standards. ""The content there is offensive to many, but does not violate our current rules for banning,"" Huffman explained.  LinkedIn (professional business networking website) - It has little to do with the bigoted content, but I found this hilarious nonetheless. Time to push more sales of GoldTM, admins  Why Marketers Should (Mostly) Avoid Reddit - Now that the dust is settling after the Reddit fiasco, marketing heads that were previously unaware of what Reddit was are already asking their digital teams how the platform can be leveraged. So, let me just skip to the end. If you're reading this in the hopes that you'll learn how to crack Reddit open and turn it into another social marketing channel, move along.

Seriously, WTF  EDIT: for clarification, I was critical of them because instead of actually focusing on the really important issue of online harassment and misogyny they instead roll out the anti-gun charade, which is a pretty typical left-wing talking point (and one I agree with, but that's irrelevant). It's just so fucking annoying when people trot out ideology in the midst of a serious discussion; the world isn't white and black or red and blue.

The subs that would actually """"""""generate content"""""""" for the site that would in theory bring more traffic from people who aren't visiting because Stormfront was down that day don't get this, but hate subs do.

I think more redditors are anti coontown than were anti FPH (or rather, less ""pro coontown"" than they were pro fph).  I just think that while FPHers were mostly shitty trolls, who yes harrassed people and I'm not minimizing that, coontowners are a much more serious real life threat.  Outside of reddit, ""fat hate"" is a thing but people don't generally fear being murdered for being overweight as far as I know. Racial hate crimes are a very real thing though.  When you see people getting called out as a coontowner, a lot of the time you'll see them downvoted. Nobody defends them like they did for FPH. With FPH you'd see people say ""it's about shaming them into health"" but you don't see that kind of thing with coontown. It's all ""yeah they're gross but where would the censorship end?""  I think banning the chimpire would be a shitstorm but I don't think it'd be as bad as fph was on reddit at least.  Though, I think the real life physical danger would be higher if they were to kick over the hornet's nest. Still needs to be kicked over either way, sooner or later."

You don't hear stories of websites banning racism and suffering a mass exodus or talk show hosts proclaiming they're against racism and losing their show because of it.  What will happen is the 0.001% of reddit who think they're fighting for freedom will whine for 3 days and finally leave or deal with it. In return, people of color and women join because now they can read reddit without seeing ""You see, the skull of the negroid predetermines the intelligence of... and that's why rape is a good thing."" +4586. People care a lot about internet points, and getting downvoted because they said ""Dindu nuffin!!"" gets the point across very clearly. They aren't welcome. Less people put off, more people to downvote the disgusting things that get upvoted, and look at that reddit is now just like society where ""race realism"" isn't something that gets you praise. Maybe then /u/spez can finally say he's proud to be part of reddit without remembering all the times reddit declared black people public enemy #1.  Weeds are growing in their garden making it impossible to grow anything else. Instead of plucking them out they're leaving them there because ""Every plant has the right to grow.""

On the other hand, racism is widespread, but people also don't usually see it as just a harmless silly game like they do with fat hate. So it could go either way, I guess.

They are hiding them behind a log in screen to explicitly make it harder for your average person to come across them and be horrified. Meanwhile, this person is lurking the front page and still giving them money, blissfully unaware that these subreddits exist. I'm sure if you look at the number a LOT of people don't make accounts and just browse, and reddit has those numbers and is seeing them as an income source. It also makes it so when someone is saids they use reddit and someone else saids ""isn't that that racist site?"" they can generally say the didn't see the content. Making reddit look better."
ShitRedditSays,3dko2h,auandi,14,Sat Jul 18 00:18:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, but a lot of people come and don't log in to view the hate sites too. If they have to log in (and creating a log in is all of like 10 seconds if you're a slow typer) they are going to make the hate communities even more active. Once you've made an account so you can laugh at black people, why not also spill over to /r/videos and explain how black people are just more prone to crime? And if you see someone's already done that, why not upvote it? Since simply upvoting is not a bannable offense, might as well tell your other chimpire buddies about it too.  Stormfront has had multiple articles where the heads of the site outline why reddit is the best source of recruits they have on the internet. This decision just made their job much easier."

ShitRedditSays,3dko2h,QQXV,13,Fri Jul 17 15:42:12 2015 UTC,"Your description is correct. But try to understand why people here are saying what they're saying.  When the ads come, they will be how most users ""pay"" for Reddit, the same way most Internet content/hosting is paid for. However, the ""quarantined"" subs being ad-free means their users aren't ""paying"" like the rest of us. Whether you're talking about a smartphone app or a website, ""turning off ads"" is normally a privilege for which one pays. Thus, users of reclassified subs are in fact getting a free ride relative to everyone else — and everyone else would be covering their costs.  I understand the bind Reddit is in here — it outright refuses to ban hateful subs but doesn't want to make money off them, thus the quarantine idea. Now, normally, the reason you don't want to make money from something you disapprove of is to disincentivize yourself from dealing with the disapproved thing, but that doesn't work in Reddit's case — because they would never ban the sub unless it crosses into illegal territory, disincentives have little effect here. At best, they have less reason to listen when quarantined-sub users request changes to the site than when ad-viewing users do, but that's minor.  And most importantly, while it's nice in principle for Reddit to avoid rewarding itself for hosting hate, the incentive problem on the other end of things has now been maximized — rather than having to pay Reddit for some kind of premium ad-free version, you just have to get your sub quarantined. There's actually an incentive to make your sub bad enough for Reddit to do this. In fact, I can definitely imagine a few non-hateful subs politely requesting the privilege. (Lots of them are already private, so there's literally no downside.) What's Reddit going to do then, charge them money for not being hateful enough to earn the right?"
ShitRedditSays,3dko2h,Pyrolytic,11,Fri Jul 17 07:46:00 2015 UTC,"Actually, you may have hit on a genius option.  Hatesubs have to ""pay their way.""  Every sub gets a monthly ""rent"" bill going forward based on size and resources required to support the sub.  Most subs can turn on ads to pay for theirs and so no real money needs to be turned over.  These reclassified subs have to cover their bill out of pocket.  Hateful speech doesn't tend to stick around as long if you have to actually pay to be able to participate in it."
ShitRedditSays,3dko2h,AlextheGreat13,13,Fri Jul 17 10:32:39 2015 UTC,Or they could just ban the hateful subs.
ShitRedditSays,3dko2h,Pyrolytic,12,Fri Jul 17 09:09:16 2015 UTC,That would require a strength of character never before seen here.  I'm trying to think of the most weak-spined way to get things to happen.
ShitRedditSays,3dko2h,QQXV,3,Fri Jul 17 08:38:27 2015 UTC,"I thought of that too, but it's too easily spun by some media as ""Reddit makes money from hateful subs"", which is very clearly what they're trying to avoid.  Perhaps they could donate all the money recieved to organizations the haters would hate. This would impose three kinds of costs: Reddit pays for hosting, haters pay a penalty, haters see their money go to to something they hate. But then the recipients would have to decide whether to accept the money, facing similar issues as Reddit itself."

This is why you see this kind of imperialist thinking persist centuries after all the way into today. It's not as overt, it's more subtle like when white people complain about affirmative action displacing talented white kids (lol). Today, we have the white savior complex. we feel that we need to ""save"" third world countries. we wouldn't need to ""save"" these countries to begin with if we hadn't imprisoned millions of people and fucked up everything. this is why many of us think africa is a war-torn poverty stricken country when parts of africa, like the south, are flourishing and will be global players in the international economy when American power meets its inevitable demise as all great empires do. Our perception is vastly distorted based on ignorance, arrogance, and imperialism.  tl;dr white people/westerners are not superior. they had an access of steel (ie weapons) which proved advantageous when they traveled to foreign countries to bully the natives into strong holding its economy via trading. they also brought over disease (smallpox-Native Americans) and drugs (opium-Chinese) to help cripple their counterparts.  and fucking l o l that tribal people have no concept of right or wrong. are tribal people constantly fighting in the middle east to protest oil interests? do they have police who brutalize people of color? do they have a justice system that actively protects the beltway elite? oh way that's right they don't and redditors are scolding tribal people for being barbaric. yet again reddit has proven itself to be an echo chamber for racists and general idiots. of course they could dismantle this by opening a book and facing the facts but that would require them to open their minds. however, opening one's mind, as we have learned, are for SJWs.  go f*ck yourself reddit"

It routinely hosts conversations and content that would never fly on Stormfront, for example, and while the community at large may not actively participate in such groups, the tenor of the reddit ""community"" has long since become broadly defined by a cavalier, even giddy crassness and cruelty.  It's not cute cat pics, harmless nerds, and stoners anymore.  It's the medieval circus atmosphere about the gallows on execution day.  Second, having failed to recognize the first point, they are falling into an old trap.  Because they haven't taken the time to learn any better, they have made the mistake of assuming their adversaries are reasonable, taking it for granted that they (like themselves) ultimately have the best interests of everyone in mind, and therefore attempt to compromise with those who have no sincere interest in negotiating anything in the first place.  If you don't realize at the outset that the other side is indifferent with respect to whether or not they get everything they want or the whole house burns down then you're hopelessly lost.  So they are going to keep making mistakes because they haven't faced up to the real problem, the awful reality of what they've built and what they've let it become.  They'll take half measures because they believe they are somehow engaged in a reasonable give and take of some kind.  They need to come to grips with the fact that this is in the top comment on their big announcement thread:   SRS has gone out of it's way to harass in the past, and while bans may not be applied retroactively, some have recently said they've gotten death threats after being linked to from there.   Unsubstantiated nonsense with an agenda so painfully obvious I may need to call an anesthesiologist."

ShitRedditSays,3djo43,shinymuskrat,59,Thu Jul 16 22:53:33 2015 UTC,"Here's what I wrote over in the main thread :   I'm crestfallen.  It really seemed like you were going to do the right thing here.  White supremacy, as an ideology, has been one of the most destructive, ugly forces for evil in the history of the human race. Two of the worst atrocities in human history -- the holocaust and the transatlantic slave trade -- are a direct result of ideologies of white supremacy, to say nothing of lynchings, disenfranchisement, and the exclusion of nonwhites in general and African-Americans specifically at every level of public and private life in America.  And atrocities abound globally and throughout history as a direct result of ideologies of racial superiority.   Reddit has become one of the #1 hubs for white supremacists on the internet. Continuing to host white supremacist communities in light of everything we know about white supremacy is not only a tacit endorsement of white supremacy but a violation of your own policies against inciting harm or violence.  You want to read subs like /r/coontown as somehow existing outside of the world, outside of the context of the very, very long history of white supremacy. To do so is irresponsible, willfully ignorant, and destructive and hurtful not just to redditors of color and white anti-racist redditors, but to every person of color who encounters members of your white supremacist community on the streets, in offices, at parties and concerts.  You have an opportunity here to fix something terrible inside reddit, to begin healing a very ugly wound that festers inside the heart of your site. And you're choosing not to for reasons I don't and cannot understand.   By standing by and allowing this community and their ideology to flourish on your site, you as a company and as individuals are culpable and stakeholders in white supremacist action, behavior, discrimination, and violence that takes place in the world.   You should be ashamed."

ShitRedditSays,3djo43,RhinestoneTaco,34,Thu Jul 16 21:32:18 2015 UTC,"From Fark:   Aside from ""not safe for work"" posts, the following are also unacceptable:   . . .   Hate speech: Criticism is not hate speech, but inflammatory comments directed at a particular ethnic group, sexual orientation, gender, religion, etc. are unacceptable and unwelcome on Fark.  Sexism, Racism and LGBT bashing: Fark is a humor site, and we've done more than our fair share at poking fun of others, often for what they've done, sometimes for what they've said, occasionally because they look funny. Fark has long prided itself on being irreverent and sarcastic.  That said, there are still some things that cross the line, and misogyny, racism and LGBT bashing are some of them. So just to be clear: these things will not be tolerated.  We know that on the internet, it's impossible to know the difference between a person with hateful views and a person lampooning hateful views to make a point. The mods try to be reasonable, and context often matters. We will try and determine what you meant, but that's not always a pass. If your post can be taken one of two ways, and one of those ways can be interpreted as misogynistic, racist, or LGBT bashing, the mods may delete it and could even give you a timeout--even if that wasn't your intent.   Surprisingly progressive, especially given the bad rep that site had back in '05 or so.  I don't know how well it's enforced."
ShitRedditSays,3djo43,Smutts,28,Thu Jul 16 21:39:24 2015 UTC,"I know, right? Homophobic/mysoginistic language gets you autobanned. From FARK. The site where the ""boobies"" tab was the original selling point. What a world we live in."

Why do you want to discuss anything with someone who thinks raping women is  okay? Why do so many people seem to think it's reasonable to pretend that certain viewpoints are not objectively wrong? What value does allowing blatant misogyny and racism add to this site? Why are we pretending that they are in anyway important things to protect from ""censorship""? I don't get it.

Instead, I think she's saying is that by allowing such subreddits to exist, we can both more easily find out who thinks raping women is ok, and can point to the subreddits as an indication of how many such people might exist. By banning the subreddits, or keeping people from saying that they support raping women, people who might otherwise reveal themselves as people with objectively wrong viewpoints may instead hide them.  If you were to view people and opinions as completely static, and accounts weren't usually anonymous, I might even agree with this: being able to more easily find out who supports raping women, or killing minorities, could be beneficial.   But the view is extremely naive. It assumes that communities like these don't strengthen the opinions of those involved, don't grow, don't diffuse outward into the rest of reddit, and don't draw others toward their horrible views, even people who otherwise might be reasonable. These sorts of effects have been seen quite frequently throughout the history of hate groups, and I think can also be seen with PUA communities, who almost seem to prey on confused or disheartened men.   Besides, allowing these communities on reddit isn't free speech. Free speech doesn't usually include giving those speaking the tools to organize their communities, it just means they won't go to jail."

AMA."":   Spirited debates are in important part of what makes Reddit special. Our goal is to spell out clear rules that everyone can understand. Any banning of content will be carefully considered against our public rules.   At 2015-07-16 20:40:06 UTC, abcabcdeabc wrote [+434 points: +434, -0]:   I have been a redditor for a very long time, and I've been part of a range of kinds of communities that vary fairly significantly.   I am also a female who was raped, and this is something I have been opened about talking fairly frequently on reddit.   I disagree with the ban of the aforementioned sub, because I feel that it sets a precedent depending on what the society deems appropriate to think about, and what it does not.   Please note, that I can not and do not pretend to speak for any woman who was raped besides myself.   What I am concerned with is this distinct drawing of a line between the people who own the site, and the people who create the content on the site. Reddit appealed to me because it was the closest thing to a speaking democracy I could find in my entire existence, utilizing technology in a way that is almost impossible to recreate across large populations of people otherwise.   This sequence of events marks this as a departure from that construct. From today onwards, I know that I am not seeing clusters of people with every aspect of their humanity shown, as ugly as it may be sometimes. I feel that it is not the subreddit that causes subs like /r/rapingwomen to exist, but this stems from a larger cultural problem. Hiding it or sweeping it under a rug from the masses is not what solves the problem; I have already lived under those rules and I have seen them to be ineffective at best and traumatizing / mentally warping at worst.   People's minds should not be ruled over by the minds of other people, and that is what I feel this has become. Internet content is thought content, idea content. It is not the act of violence - these are two very separate things. You can construct a society that appears to value and cherish women's rights in the highest regard, and yet the truth can be the furthest thing from it.   I really would hope that you would reconsider your position. To take away the right of being able to know with certainty that one can speak freely without fear, I don't have many words to offer that fully express my sadness at that.   The problem is not the banning of specifics. The problem is how it affects how people reason afterwards about their expectations of the site and their interactions with others. It sets up new social constructs and new social rules, and will alter things significantly, even fractions of things you would not expect. It is like a butterfly effect across the mind, to believe you can speak freely, and to have that taken away.

Blaming Islam in general is not a rational conclusion from all the Islamic extremism that occurs, it is almost always a result of deep-rooted political issues such as the Syrian war and the Israel-Palestine conflict.

ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,str1cken,5,Thu Jul 16 19:18:07 2015 UTC,Hope you had the right equipment to handle that septic tank. :D
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,OneJobToRuleThemAll,4,Thu Jul 16 20:16:26 2015 UTC,I just gave up partway through and posted it like that's how much I intended to do all along. XD
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,str1cken,6,Thu Jul 16 20:25:26 2015 UTC,Never mind.
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,maddoxpatt,13,Thu Jul 16 17:43:52 2015 UTC,/r/kotakuinaction  It's the gamergate sub and literally the best place on reddit /s
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,Nixon4Prez,6,Thu Jul 16 17:47:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I figured it out. What a great place.
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,maddoxpatt,7,Thu Jul 16 19:34:30 2015 UTC,Most of his comments are just copy-pasted blocks of text with the sentences rearranged
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,KnotPtelling,30,Thu Jul 16 21:12:34 2015 UTC,"This perpetuates stereotypes of the ""East"" as savage - it may not exactly be racist in that it doesn't explicitly reference race, but it's close enough."
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,Katoyllae,-24,Thu Jul 16 17:44:19 2015 UTC,Me dissing somebody for being a douche doesn't turn into racism simply because our races aren't the same. That's a stretch in the wrong direction.
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,blufr0g,29,Thu Jul 16 17:49:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think you've followed what I was saying. The original comment associates the ""East"", populated predominantly by non-white peoples, with cannibalism, reinforcing stereotypes of non-Western (implicitly non-white) peoples as ""savages"". That is very close to racism, even if you don't feel comfortable calling it racism."
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,Katoyllae,17,Thu Jul 16 17:52:43 2015 UTC,go away
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,jaayyne,18,Thu Jul 16 18:09:19 2015 UTC,"wow u really took the high ground, u should be so proud"
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,GammaTainted,15,Thu Jul 16 18:13:07 2015 UTC,"Nope. Check out ""Orientalism"" by Edward Said."
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,Katoyllae,12,Thu Jul 16 18:19:33 2015 UTC,Truuuuu colooooors.
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,RiskyChris,2,Thu Jul 16 19:01:56 2015 UTC,Remember what they said? It's deleted CENSORED
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,RamblinWreckGT,2,Thu Jul 16 18:20:38 2015 UTC,"I do not, I reserve approximately 50 brain cells to the opinions of bigots so that shit gets rewritten pretty often. =)"
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,RiskyChris,2,Thu Jul 16 19:17:53 2015 UTC,Right after I asked I saw it was still readable from his user page. Said we're all just oversensitive.
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,RamblinWreckGT,21,Fri Jul 17 11:52:04 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, pretending to be from a made-up stereotype of a ""savage"" culture in order to add humour to your graphic description of how you'd like to brutally murder an Asian woman for...literally nothing at this point, she had nothing to do with the shit they're getting their diapers in a twist over, is definitely not racist."
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,psirynn,34,Fri Jul 17 19:17:00 2015 UTC,"I always say that Ellen Pao was metaphorically burned on a stick by the Reddit community when people bring up that she ""deserved"" her treatment.  It's kind of frightening how close I could've gotten to scrapping the word ""metaphorically"" out of that sentence if these people actually stood by their word more."
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,IAmATreeYes,85,Fri Jul 17 20:43:43 2015 UTC,"Because a CEO doing her job against a few nexkbeards' opinions is definitely punishable via disembowelment!  I love how reddit can be completely white supremacist and call other cultures primitive, and then cheers them on as they suggest ways to murder the neckbeards' imaginary enemy."
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,Seattle_man_123,13,Thu Jul 16 18:15:15 2015 UTC,I like how even KiA is calling bullshit.
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,alysonskye,13,Thu Jul 16 15:42:56 2015 UTC,/r/thathappened
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,KomeradObnobs,33,Thu Jul 16 14:31:40 2015 UTC,"Excellent recipe for cooking pig, terrible system of justice."
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,Level100ProtWarrior,21,Thu Jul 16 18:26:01 2015 UTC,How is it STILL Pao's fault
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,SRS_IS_GOD,6,Thu Jul 16 17:35:41 2015 UTC,I saw this comment when the early fires of the Victoria fallout were just starting to happen.
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,leavingforgood,6,Thu Jul 16 15:14:36 2015 UTC,The post is 11 days old.  Or was that a trick question because it was never her fault?
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,Smilez619,6,Thu Jul 16 18:08:02 2015 UTC,I now see it's 11 days old. Doesn't make it any less horryfying.
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,SRS_IS_GOD,21,Thu Jul 16 18:57:05 2015 UTC,[Upvoted by Kia.]  Kia members are disgusting pieces of shit.
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,-who_is_john_galt-,28,Thu Jul 16 20:29:04 2015 UTC,Good to know I have an account on a website that boasts cannibals among its users.
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,a_faget,6,Thu Jul 16 20:29:42 2015 UTC,"Wait, did reddit island actually happen while I wasn't looking?"
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,Azza_bamboo,8,Thu Jul 16 17:22:56 2015 UTC,"hmm, you might just say he's triggered."
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,thingsjusthappen,11,Thu Jul 16 15:38:18 2015 UTC,"See, normally I would support such measures being taken against a CEO. But the anti-Pao brigade is a fundamentally reactionary phenomenon.   They don't (I guess didn't now) hate her because of her class position. Hell, they probably didn't even give a fuck about whatever dodgy stuff her partner did (not that that should reflect on her). It was purely because she was a woman who did the smallest action to nudge reddit in the right direction.   I supported Pao like the bolsheviks supported Kerensky against Kornilov.   Edit: also, c'mon. KiA is totally the lowest of all the hanging fruit!"

ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,ttumblrbots,3,Thu Jul 16 18:20:46 2015 UTC,I don't think they do that anywhere.
ShitRedditSays,3di9ua,JaapHoop,3,Thu Jul 16 16:39:43 2015 UTC,Why do I get a feeling his culture resides in the temple of doom?
