illusionporn,3ct13b,Peamealsandwich,7,Mon Jul 13 03:23:46 2015 UTC,But...how?
illusionporn,3ct13b,zeekar,8,Fri Jul 10 18:29:35 2015 UTC,"There are two main voices, exactly one octave apart, descending together.  It starts out with the lower tone loud and the higher tone soft, but the intensities slowly swap so that in the middle of the octave they're the same volume and by the time it gets to the bottom the higher tone is the loud one, so the primary pitch you hear is the same one you started with even though you've heard a full octave's worth of descent. Then the quiet voice jumps up to the higher octave and the whole thing loops.  So, you hear a constant descent through the scale, but at the same time the note is going down, the octave you hear it in is slowly being replaced with a higher one. The two effects are in synch so that it winds up exactly back where it started, ready to loop again."
illusionporn,3ct13b,vonjarga,5,Fri Jul 10 20:34:58 2015 UTC,This is a very nice explanation. Thanks.

illusionporn,3ct13b,allie_h_123,6,Fri Jul 10 19:43:39 2015 UTC,I can clearly hear the tone restart at a higher pitch every 20 seconds or so. It just sounds like the same tone is layered overlapping to create the illusion that it's constantly falling but it's not.

illusionporn,3c06bd,miamistu,29,Fri Jul 3 16:22:22 2015 UTC,"Ames room:       An Ames room is a distorted room that is used to create an optical illusion. Likely influenced by the writings of Hermann Helmholtz, it was invented by American ophthalmologist Adelbert Ames, Jr. in 1934, and constructed in the following year.  An Ames room is viewed with one eye through a pinhole such as to avoid any clues from stereopsis, and it is constructed so that from the front it appears to be an ordinary cubic-shaped room, with a back wall and two side walls parallel to each other and perpendicular to the horizontally level floor and ceiling. However, this is a trick of perspective and the true shape of the room is trapezoidal: the walls are slanted and the ceiling and floor are at an incline, and the right corner is much closer to the front-positioned observer than the left corner (or vice versa). (See overhead view diagram to the right)  As a result of the optical illusion, a person standing in one corner appears to the observer to be a giant, while a person standing in the other corner appears to be a dwarf. The illusion is so convincing that a person walking back and forth from the left corner to the right corner appears to grow or shrink.

illusionporn,3b9w3k,ChosunYin,20,Sat Jun 27 05:43:34 2015 UTC,"In complicated words, the translational proper motion remains constant after the collision. Basically, it was hit at such an angle that it moves across your field of vision with the same direction and speed, even though the ball is now coming toward you."
illusionporn,3b9w3k,LithiumEnergy,14,Sat Jun 27 14:18:24 2015 UTC,"You're ignoring the importance of the perfectly, and coincidentally, timed camera zoom out that forces perspective on the ball so that it looks as though it grows smaller as it moves toward the viewer."
illusionporn,3b9w3k,CrankyPhotographer,2,Sat Jun 27 16:21:13 2015 UTC,"Ah yes of course. This is called orthographic perspective - like a star or planet is hard to determine whether it is going toward or away from us being so far away.  I'm not sure that the zoom however is the major factor, but that the distance between the camera and the ball is far enough"
illusionporn,3b9w3k,LithiumEnergy,6,Sat Jun 27 23:23:11 2015 UTC,I think he clipped the tip of the barrel on the ball as it just barely got in range.
illusionporn,3b9w3k,thorium007,2,Sat Jun 27 06:08:23 2015 UTC,I think that the camera didn't record the point where the bat touched the ball. Which is causing part of the effect.   The other thing is that the ball kind of stayed in the same line of sight after it was hit.

illusionporn,3afrs3,ThePhil652,11,Fri Jun 19 19:56:42 2015 UTC,"so I was standing on a balcony and looked over the edge.   Underneath me were a flight of stairs that I took a photo of.   As I processed the photo in Instagram, I rotated the photo 180 degrees at which time I thought it gave the photo the illusion of standing in front of the stairs and looking straight at them.   edit: since this is being downvoted I thought it might be because I didn't explain myself very well so here is a copy from another comment below. if I keep getting downvoted I can conclude that I'm just a jerk who loves wasting everybody's time-  here is another photo I took that gives a better perspective of where I was standing:  http://imgur.com/P2kbyUx  and when I rotated the photo I thought it looked like I was standing at the bottom of the stairs, except for the slip guard things."

illusionporn,3afrs3,gnualmafuerte,4,Fri Jun 19 22:23:19 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that stairs look the same whichever way you look at them, so it's not a very interesting illusion.

illusionporn,372d5i,simon73,13,Sun May 24 10:38:24 2015 UTC,Everything you think you can see in your Peripheral vision is based on a what you've already seen in your direct vision since the pictures are extremely close to your direct vision you only see part of the faces and your brain tries to tell you what it is but because they keep changing it can't make a correct interpretation.    A good proof of how bad our peripheral vision is is to pick something to stare at and have a friend hold a small object at 180 degrees from you and about 10 feet away. Try to describe what it is (color shape etc).  Then have them move 10-20 degrees (while remaining 10 feet away) and repeat. As long as you don't look directly at them at all. You won't know what it is even at about 10 degrees off from your direct vision but as soon as you look at it you can probably describe it even at 180 degrees away
illusionporn,372d5i,TinklyMagician,1 point,Sun May 24 12:47:08 2015 UTC,"Because you have eyes on the back of your head, or because you know what it is so you can describe it from memory?"
illusionporn,372d5i,test_beta,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:21:34 2015 UTC,"It's something like memory. But is more of a subconscious process. For example, it is nearly impossible to see color in your peripheral vision due to lack of cone cells in those regions of your eyes. However you can often see the color of things in your peripheral vision because, even if you didn't consciously notice the color of whatever object it is, your brain did notice (subconsciously). The experiment I mentioned can prove this as well. As long as you don't know what the object is  (because memory can also factor in to create the ""brain map"") or see it before hand the color you guess will most likely be grey or black"
illusionporn,372d5i,TinklyMagician,2,Tue Jun 2 01:42:17 2015 UTC,"We all have tunnel vision and most people never even notice.  That part of our vision is geared towards noticing movement instead of detail. It's good at seeing the difference in an image from one moment to the next in other words. That's why the faces are distorted, we're noticing the differences between the last face we saw and the face displayed."

illusionporn,372d5i,cabothief,3,Sun May 24 17:21:39 2015 UTC,"Prosopagnosia:       Prosopagnosia /ˌprɒsəpæɡˈnoʊʒə/ (Greek: ""prosopon"" = ""face"", ""agnosia"" = ""not knowing""), also called face blindness,  is a cognitive disorder of face perception where the ability to recognize faces is impaired, while other aspects of visual processing (e.g., object discrimination) and intellectual functioning (e.g., decision making) remain intact. The term originally referred to a condition following acute brain damage (acquired prosopagnosia), but a congenital or developmental form of the disorder also exists, which may affect up to 2.5% of the population.  The specific brain area usually associated with prosopagnosia is the fusiform gyrus,  which activates specifically in response to faces. The functionality of the fusiform gyrus allows most people to recognize faces in more detail than they do similarly complex inanimate objects. For those with prosopagnosia, the new method for recognizing faces depends on the less-sensitive object recognition system. The right hemisphere fusiform gyrus is more often involved in familiar face recognition than the left. It remains unclear whether the fusiform gyrus is only specific for the recognition of human faces or if it is also involved in highly trained visual stimuli.

illusionporn,372d5i,cabothief,3,Sun May 24 19:18:29 2015 UTC,"most of the pictures are shopped heavily and your peripheral vision just accentuates the changes, not even by that much"
illusionporn,372d5i,zarly1,7,Sun May 24 19:20:52 2015 UTC,"It works with or without photoshop. It works better if the pictures are cropped and centered, is that what you meant by shopped?"
illusionporn,372d5i,comanon,3,Sun May 24 15:24:45 2015 UTC,"I think they also shop them slightly to make the eyes and mouths match up on each picture, but very little."
illusionporn,372d5i,JetpackAwaaay01,-2,Sun May 24 16:36:41 2015 UTC,No like their facial features are all out of whack. Some have eyes too big or too small or chins stretched down and stuff like that. Just don't look in the middle and look directly ate the faces and you will see they are shopped to look ridiculous
illusionporn,372d5i,zarly1,3,Sun May 24 22:19:12 2015 UTC,I really think you're only saying that because they aren't great pictures of people you're familiar with. I don't have any reason to think they're shopped for the illusion to work. Show me the original photo vs the supposedly shopped ones we have here and maybe I'll consider the possibility.

illusionporn,372d5i,Thynis,1 point,Mon May 25 19:00:22 2015 UTC,That's terrifying.
illusionporn,372d5i,theowest,1 point,Mon May 25 20:40:55 2015 UTC,"Our vision is blurry in our peripheral. We're seeing the differences between the face displayed and the last face without any real detail.  What we see is just a blurry face, what we see after out brain processes the face is a best estimation with limited detail. The end result is us noticing giant foreheads, long noses, tiny/huge eyes and mouths. We don't notice or see all the nuances of the faces that would help us process the images normally.  I'm guessing that the fact that you're seeing two different faces on either side helps distort what we end up noticing too."

illusionporn,372d5i,JetpackAwaaay01,18,Sun May 24 18:07:04 2015 UTC,"It's because their eyes and mouth have to be positioned at the same place in each picture for the illusion to work.

illusionporn,372d5i,Nero_A,5,Sun May 24 08:20:54 2015 UTC,"Not the same thing, but how would it have looked without the distortion? Your mind is looking at famous people that you are familiar with and it's trying to make sense of it because they don't look right. It is a mind fuck, but it's a manufactured mind fuck."

They're just letters that happen to be the same color as the background; it isn't negative space at all. Just because there's little gaps in the edges does not this an illusion make.   EDIT: The illusion in the vase/faces image hinges on visual ambiguity. There is no clear outline or detail in the image to determine which color is negative space; this the viewer can choose the one or the other. It looks like a thing it is not; an illusion.  The graffiti, on the other hand, has zero ambiguity. There is a single, intentional, and direct interpretation, clearly indicated by outline and detail. It looks like exactly what it is, and is not illusory in any way."
illusionporn,35j9v3,IamSeth,6,Mon May 11 00:13:26 2015 UTC,"Have you taken basic psychology? This image is messing with the interaction of our visual cues, it definitely belongs here."
illusionporn,35j9v3,catmousehat,-11,Mon May 11 08:52:42 2015 UTC,"No it isn't.   Again, those letters are clearly outlined, and even have shading.  There is no psychology at work beyond basic language recognition.   The guy drew some letters and did not fill them in. They are the same color as the wall, but fully outlined. There is a single definitive interpretation of the image, with no ambiguity. It is not illusory.  I'm not stating an opinion here, guys. It's just not an illusion. The word means a specific thing, and that definition does not fit that image."
illusionporn,35j9v3,IamSeth,4,Mon May 11 09:15:22 2015 UTC,"As a matter of fact, it is.   The visual cue of contrast is being affected here. It's not much of an illusion, but by definition it still is."
illusionporn,35j9v3,kitsua,-10,Mon May 11 09:20:01 2015 UTC,"""By definition"" it is not. Here's the definition of ""illusion"", since you've brought it up.   a thing that is or is likely to be wrongly perceived or interpreted by the senses.    ""the illusion makes parallel lines seem to diverge by placing them on a zigzag-striped background""    a deceptive appearance or impression.    ""the illusion of family togetherness""    a false idea or belief.    ""he had no illusions about the trouble she was in""   Now, as far as this sub is concerned, it is the first definition that comes into play. That definition categorically does not apply to the image we're discussing. There is no ""wrong perception"". There are letters, clearly shaded and outlined. Yes, they overlap. Yes, it is visually stunning. No, it is not an illusion. Neither of the other definitions apply either.  For that matter, here's the definition given in the sidebar of this sub:   ""Perception of something objectively existing in such a way as to cause misinterpretation of its actual nature.""   Yeah, no, not an illusion.  As a side note, most visual illusions have nothing to do with psychology and everything to do with optical neuroscience. It's a hardware issue, not a software one. You'd know that, if you'd ""taken basic psychology""."

illusionporn,35a4qe,zxo,2,Fri May 8 17:15:38 2015 UTC,No you're right.  To use /u/trixter21992251's example:  d -----horizontal flip----> b ----vertical flip-----> p  (or)  d -----vertical flip----> q ----horizontal flip-----> p  both of which are the same as rotating 180 degrees.
illusionporn,35a4qe,MichaelThorsett,1 point,Sat May 9 00:28:17 2015 UTC,"No, rotating and flipping are distinct operations.  I'm not sure I can explain, but let me try.  You have a placemat in front of you. You're in Debbie's Diner. Having lunch.  You rotate (spin) the placemat 180 degrees, to where it's now ""upside-down.""  It never stopped touching the table.  Now, you pick it up, and flop it over top to bottom (note that this time, it left the table).  Now, it's right-side up (not upside-down), and assuming it's transparent or translucent (like a photo negative), it's reflected (or ""backwards"").  Make sense?"
illusionporn,35a4qe,trixter21992251,3,Fri May 8 19:55:43 2015 UTC,d rotated 180° is p  d flipped vertically is q  d flipped horisontally is b

illusionporn,34tuct,smellis45,31,Mon May 4 14:56:05 2015 UTC,"The image of Lennon is a black and white image lightened to a very, very light grey instead of black. The black bars provide so much contrast that you can't differentiate the grey from the white: Compared to the black bars, it's all essentially ""white"". If there's enough blur (either motion blur if you move your eyes or the image really fast, or regular blurry vision like when you squint) basically the darkness from the black bars will bleed into the white bars, in essence lowering the contrast, and making the grey image more discernable from the white. It's kind of like the moiré effect; not exactly but it's similar.  edit: I thought about it and my previous explanation didn't make sense. Blurring your vision lowers the contrast, not raise it.  edit 2: Here's what you get if you replace the black bars with white (and not touch the original ""white"" bars)."
