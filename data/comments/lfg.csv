lfg,3e2gn8,Firecrotch2014,5,Tue Jul 21 13:15:09 2015 UTC,This has been brought up before and rejected as an idea.
lfg,3e2gn8,RiffyDivine2,5,Tue Jul 21 13:51:52 2015 UTC,"The best we can figure is that he was playing us the whole time and never intended to go through with DMing the game.   After 20 years of tabletop I can tell you that it is extremely unlikely this is the case.  The most likely thing is that he succumbed to GM anxiety and probably feels like a dick.  I nearly cancel every game I play due to GM anxiety, it's just something I had to learn to get over."
lfg,3e2gn8,OrbitalStrikeBadger,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:37 2015 UTC,Yeah. This doesn't sound like something a DM would do just to fuck with people. And I think it's a bit of a dick move to assume it was. Maybe he has important shit going on. Maybe he was gonna DM for you guys and then got a new job. Maybe he moved!  You just can't assume stuff like that.
lfg,3e2gn8,Forestisinthetrees,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:05:31 2015 UTC,"Any more than you can assume he lost all access to the internet because of any of those things. It takes 30 seconds to send an apology message. There is no excuse not to barring the actual death of the person in question. I've had a bunch of games just stop with no warning, and no reason. It's BS and it needs to stop. If having a shame list helps with that, then great."
lfg,3e2gn8,sumelar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:26 2015 UTC,"That's your prerogative, I mean if you had something really urgent and you needed to go do it but it involved cutting off people you don't know, I know i'd do it without second thoughts. People have lives. People need to do things. Sometimes things get in the way, and people don't have time to go back and apologize to every person they screwed over on the way. Thatvs life pal, it ain't stopping."

lfg,3e2gn8,Pathfinder_Veteran,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:37:55 2015 UTC,"Obviously it wasn't a job or moving if he cut all communication 10 minutes before the session was supposed to start.  GM anxiety is understandable, and tough to communicate about by it's very nature.  Anything else is really inexcusable as he had communication lines open to tell his players what was going on."
lfg,3e2gn8,SpartiGaz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:57 2015 UTC,"My point is not that it's about what caused it, my point is that anything can happen and it's not always gonna be explained."
lfg,3e2gn8,Forestisinthetrees,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:09 2015 UTC,"dude, like /u/vampwood said above, you have time to block and delete people, you have time to explain yourself, if you go through all that prepwork and character creation and stuff, you are setting up the expectancy of an event, if that event is then going to be cancelled, they both have a right to know that it is cancelled (not necessarily why) and the right to be upset about it."
lfg,3e2gn8,SpartiGaz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:01:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you don't have the right to be upset, i'm saying that you can't help it. He didn't tell them. Simple as that. What's done is done."
lfg,3e2gn8,Forestisinthetrees,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:42:41 2015 UTC,Why didn't somebody else from the group step up and GM?

Taking the abuse his grandfather gave to him for the majority of his life lead him to a life of crime, stealing, lying, intimidating people, and much more. When he became seventeen Mally decided enough was enough and snapped. He killed his grandfather and took all of his money, valuables, and books. It took Mally a year or two to figure out that these books were sorcerer books, with all his hate buildt up he studied them and trained in the ways of sorcerery. At age twenty two he became as well accustomed as he could be to being a sorcerer and set out to travel the world for his own needs for the greater good of things. With his mouse Tif and a picture to remind him of what his parents looked like Mally adventured getting into several types of mischief.  Ranger Kel ""Little Paw"" Thako a halfing born into the world in a small camp with his family, Mother, father, and sister. He took up lessons from his father on how to handle the real world of living in a place that wouldn't be a town. Living with nature and growing to love animals he crafted his own bows and practiced daily hunting and tracking beast's with his father. One day came though where he was hunting with his father and a black bear killed his father due to unfortunate accident of miss timing. Kel killing the bear that murdered his father created a grave with the bears fur for his Father. Returning to his mother and sister and explaining the situation they decided they were going to go and live in a town, instead of following in their footsteps and going along with them Kel was too close to nature to leave it. He said his farewells to his mother and sister and stayed where his father taught him how to live, though it did come to a point where Kel decided to travel searching for adventure and treasures in the world.

I'm an Aussie, but I'm typically home during the day, so scheduling shouldn't be that massive of an issue.

lfg,3dv0co,Leadrabbit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:34:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you need the core WoD book as well (PDF version should be cheap I think.)  The way that the various supernatural games work is ""build a normal human, then add a paranormal template on top of that"", and the WoD book (+ God Machine Rules Update) has the rules for building a normal human."

lfg,3dv0co,Bohicenef,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:46:20 2015 UTC,"cool, gives me time to read the whole book. two last questions, I like to set up test characters to practice a bit so I know I can do it proper before the game, are we starting out without the mage thingy or do we start as mages and the character creation process uses both dots and exp, whats the difference."
lfg,3dv0co,Bohicenef,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:02:49 2015 UTC,"Hi, i'm interested in giving Mage: The Awakening a try. I have no experience with Mage. I do however have a little experience with NWOD (Changeling: The Lost).  Do you have any ideas/plans on time and day of week?"
lfg,3dv0co,MrTeddybear,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:52:36 2015 UTC,"Lack of experience is absolutely not a problem.    The time would depend entirely on group availability.  I'm a graduate student, so my hours/days of availability are pretty flexible.  Basically the only time I can say it absolutely won't be is Monday evenings, because that's when my (WoD-phobic!) local group meets.    That said, I'm located in EST (GMT-5) so I think it would most likely end up being afternoon/evening hours in that time zone."
lfg,3dv0co,MrTeddybear,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:45:03 2015 UTC,"OK, thanks, my hours and days are flexible as well.  Which books will we be needing specifically?  Will we be playing through roll20, do you have another platform, or will it be more theater of mind style?  Will we be using voice chat, or purely text?  I would personally prefer if we could go through character creation together, as a group or one on one.  Sorry for bombarding you with questions."
lfg,3dv0co,MrTeddybear,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:17:45 2015 UTC,"No worries, questions are good for you, good for me, and good for anybody else who might be interested.  Players would only need the core books: WoD core, Mage core, and the God Machine rules update (which last I checked was free?).    When the Mage 2e rules are released (I believe date is still TBA) that would probably end up being required also though if that were a dealbreaker we might be able to fudge it.    That said, I have the whole product line except for like 2 books, so players who had other books and wanted to work with some of that material would be totally welcome to use it (after consulting with me, some splatbook rotes are ridiculous.)  Still figuring out the platform, roll20 looks promising but it's been a few years since I ran a game online so I want to bring myself up to speed.   Haven't decided voice chat v. text.  I'm a bit of a ham so I like yakkin' out loud, but I have in the past found pure text does have advantages (When I try to voice female NPCs I sound ridiculous...).  That would probably come down to group decision.  Chargen would definitely have a group component, I find it's the best way to build a group that meshes well once the dice start rollin'."

I'm going to try to find a decent dice roller site known for its fairness (I would otherwise be running this on the Sufficient Velocity forum as I know it has a dice roll in it, but it tends to be biased towards low rolls in my experience.), figure out how character creation works in this pdf I found, then let you know! 😃"

I don't mind silliness so much as ""I'm going to punch this guard in the nuts and then try to tickle the king because it's what my character would do!!"" The kinda stuff that impedes gameplay.

Also what is your play-style?   I'm also waiting for a few more responses before I pick players, so I'm mostly wondering what you could bring to our game."
lfg,3dsyf5,SkornRising,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:27:14 2015 UTC,I have been In around 8 and have dmed a few so. I am experienced. I normally play as a chaotic neutral person but as a fighter I will get a increased critical range so I can be a great front line asset to the team.
lfg,3dsyf5,freakingfairy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:22:39 2015 UTC,"I am definitely interested. I would create whatever class and/or character concept that would best benefit the party!  I have been playing on and off for 14 years, currently 26 y/o."

My schedule is about as flexible as it gets, and I want to find a group to play in and have some fun.    RP is my favorite, and what I'm best at, but creative combat is fun too. Silly sounds great right now; I run a Horror-themed game which tends to take it's toll as there are only so many ways to describe gorn.  I can play almost anything, in terms of classes, but if I had my pick I'd want to go against type and play as an aristocratic elven cat-burglar (I'm usually the DPS caster or cleric).  If you need something else though, I'll play that.  Just looking to UNwind with D&D for a change."

I'm open to playing whatever class the group might be lacking, and I'll probably choose my race based on that. Just about every race has some really awesome roleplay potential, so I'm not really as picky about race as maybe I should be.   I'm definitely open to a game with humor. I'm free all the time, since I'm an online college student and can make my schedule work around the game. Hope I didn't get to this thread too late!"

I'm really hoping I can get a taste of actually playing now."
lfg,3dsgmg,aefax,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:19:35 2015 UTC,"Greetings Ticklebump,  I have been playing computer game adaptations of the D&D setting growing up, particularly campaigns and modules for Neverwinter Nights plus some Planescape, I read a few rulebooks and some lore recreationally without any serious intention to ever play tabletop, but recently after reading a starter 5E book (or three!) it is beginning to look like a genuine fluid role playing experience would do my emotional life some good and might be quite enjoyable, too. :) Among other things I am interested in popular science, fiction and a bit of philosophy, so after reading OoTS, I assume I would be able to bring a healthy dose of roleplaying and moderately macabre wit to the party. I have to confess my lack of knowledge about character optimization at this juncture, though.  My schedule is flexible this time of year and the time difference between you and Eastern Europe puts the group get-together time in late afternoon -- early night, which looks like a perfect and safe time to do this sort of thing. Please note that I love my Linux box and this is something I not willing to change for the sake of participation (roll20.net, Skype and other common stuff is supported, of course), so please accommodate.   I am interested in playing a neutral human Necromancer Wizard or other kind magic-user, which I am tempted to try and base around a crazy-prepared controller ""Batman"" archetype. I don't think it's going to conflict with your trigger-happy Evocations specialist's role, but if you object, I bet there is an Elder One willing to strike a pact around those parts. I may also ask for a bit of assistance with building a balanced character before we play, since XL 5 is a little bit of progression. There is another ""players wanted"" offer I responded to before this, but other than that I am all yours.  P. S. Are you using theater of the mind or miniatures? Do you have a magic-intensive setting? Any optional rules?"

lfg,3drezj,Crowdough,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:59:57 2015 UTC,"Would you care for a group that does text-based DnD over roll20?   I don't mind schooling newbies. We do a fair bit of roleplaying although there'll be some combat as well.  You'll start as level one (it's a fresh campaign) and you're going to be a villager in a village of 70-100 people. Main demographics of this village is Dwarves, Gnomes, Elves, and fairies out in the woods. The time era is roughly the 19th century but not really 1800s or the Napoleonic wars, just shamelessly inspired off of it. Firearms and old warfare is making a tenuous use with one another but there's no doubt that platemail knights are not nearly as relevant with the commonality of firearms and the effectiveness of cannons and musket volleys. We use pathfinder. We play every saturday (give or take) at 1 PM GMT -5 (Texas time/CST) and we play on roll20. We use skype to whinge about things OOCly and while Pathfinder is not really noob friendly and can be obtuse at times I'm used to explaining things so that people can grasp what's up. There's not really any house rules. There's a few inconsistencies in Pathfinder but it'll get addressed as time goes on.   Bonus points if you tell me of your character concept ahead of time. Don't worry too much about the details, I'll tell you what does and doesn't work but I'm more interested to see what type of character you play. (less so about mechanics, more about the actual character her/himself.)"

I mostly have played 5e but have experience with 3.5. The first group I played with mostly did 3.5 and then we switched to 5e when a friend of ours bought a few of the books.  I've come to love the Roleplaying aspect of DnD and really can get into character. Delving into a backstory and avoiding meta-gaming really makes a campaign great and adds for some challenges we wouldn't have otherwise. I do meta-game at times, but mostly when it's a fun experience and I'm joking with friends.  Expierience with R20: I've used it once or twice with a couple of groups, but I didn't jump into it too much. I would personally like to have at least Skype up during it."

lfg,3dbadp,jetoc,2,Wed Jul 15 05:05:54 2015 UTC,"Hey there. Name's david, a dutchman so same timezone as you :). Pathfinder's my favorite game and i'm pretty much always up for adding another session to my weekly schedule (schedules willing, of course). I'm a moderately experienced player and I've got no bias against new GM's; in fact, the best GM out of all the ones i've played with was a new GM when we started playing together. I'd definitely be interested to play with you! i think i might be of use, i've been called a ""second dm"" before in games; i tend to involve myself in discussions as to what kind of skill/ability should be rolled, look up rules for the GM so he can keep on talking, and help new players with their character and all that kind of stuff; i've got the time for it, and i enjoy doing it, so why the heck not.  My schedule is decently filled, completely open days for me would be Monday, Tuesday, Friday and Sunday. Could pretty much play any time until like, 11pm or so at night CET when people in my house start heading off to bed.  Other than that, i love worldbuilding and even though i don't have the confidence to GM myself yet i'd like to get there one day, and so i like helping the dm out with brainstorming stuff for the setting if it's custom and things like that. If you want somebody to bounce ideas of i will be that guy happily."

Here is our Roll20 page.  Here is the reddit post I made a few days back!  We're a goofy bunch but love Pathfinder. PM me to exchange Skype details and we'll see what happens!
lfg,3dbj6t,Retromagika,2,Wed Jul 15 00:08:31 2015 UTC,"Here's my advice on how to get some of your buddies into D&D.   Forget all the complicated rules at first. Just start with painting a scene. It could be something like this: ""You're standing in a tavern, aching and hungry from troubled travels. The clatter and chatter of food and merriment surrounds you. One figure stands out however. In the corner, there is a wizard in white puffing from a long pipe. As you watch him, his eyes briefly catch yours and you hear a voice in your mind 'I've been expecting you.'"" Even better, make up a scene that will appeal to your buddy's interests.   Now ask your friend ""What do you do?""   Whatever they say, just make up what happens next.   If your friend asks to try an action that could fail, have them roll dice. Tell them that you have a number in your mind, and if they roll higher they succeed, otherwise they fail. A 6-sided die might be easy for you to find if you have other board games in the house (if you don't have a 20-sided die). If you lack dice, you could even play rock paper, scissors to decide outcomes.   The key is to get your friend to play an interactive story with you without forcing them to learn a ton of rules first. Rules seems boring at first, until you learn that they make the game more fun. Make your buddy interested to find out what happens next as a result of their actions. Give them a simple task to complete in this imaginary world, like scare away a troll that's been stealing sheep from the town. When they succeed, reward their character a special magical item that they can use if they decide to play this game with you again. Then wrap up the game and leave them wanting more.  If you get friends hooked on this simple version of interactive storytelling, they'll finally understand that D&D is fun even if they don't know all the rules. But they'll start to understand that the more rules you learn, the more fun this interactive story game gets. Keep playing and introducing only a few new rules at a time, so they don't get overwhelmed.   As a final note, you probably know which of your friends are creative and imaginative and which ones aren't. Try this game with your friends who already enjoy fantasy and imagination. Your other friends may not enjoy this game even if you drag them into playing it, which won't be fun for either of you.   Good luck, little guy :)"

lfg,3dbj6t,thecal714,0,Wed Jul 15 04:38:13 2015 UTC,Presumably you mean 5e D&D? There are other games with 5th editions.  Have you tried Roll20?

Search for my username on Skype and let's talk about it whenever you want.  Edit: To expand on why ""I'm still unsure"" about Fate, I GMed two games that turned into below average. My players are more like Pathfinder/DnD and it's a different mindset. First, I wasn't really familiar with what constitute a good aspect so I allowed stuff like ""I'm the best Jedi in the galaxy"". First game was a one shot of Fate Core with two players set in Star Wars Old Republic. I was overwhelmed and not prepared.  The second game was with Atomic Robo. I had two players again and it was better but still not as fun as my typical games I play. I had the rules memorized, no big scenario planned but my players were not ready for the ""proactive"" part of the game for that night so I had to push them a little and it didn't work out so well.  I fell in love with Fate but when I tried to confess my love I threw up on her. I just need another chance."

lfg,3d53pv,windofboe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:31:10 2015 UTC,Are you a DM or part of a group that already has a DM (and a maximum of 4 players)? We can start whenever really. The DM can set a time in a weekday afternoon or at any point during a weekend. We just need to know if characters should be pre-made and whether to roll for stats or use point buy. If there are some other house rules that would be nice to know about before we start as well (eg. no magic/gods or very different homebrew world etc.).
lfg,3d53pv,windofboe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:35:59 2015 UTC,I was looking to be part of your group but I can  DM to the best of my ability Do you want to use roll20 or just talk and play. I like gods in the game so thats fine. Create your own characters. Is tomorrow good for you?

lfg,3d2uw0,classicgabe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:36:00 2015 UTC,We play pathfinder and we're just starting to play star wars edge of the empire. So we're going to probably rotate between those when we play. Out pathfinder group you're welcome to join if that's possible for you. The issue might be we play Sunday's around noon when ever our schedules line up there isn't a lot of consistency when were able to get together.  Either way we're a super laid back group I am not a very experienced gm but we're all still learning pathfinder. We don't take anything super seriously but we try to role play seriously when its necessary. Right now we're playing through the rise of the rune lords campaign we just finished chapter one. And honestly our cleric just died so if your like to jump in as one Wed be starting you our around level 4 and Wed have our current cleric re roll since he's not enjoying the cleric a whole lot.

As much Charisma, Int and Wisdom as able with at least 10 in constitution.  His Feat would be Spell Sniper His Patron would be The Great Old One and his Pact would be Pact of the Tomb. In his younger days he adored the arcane weavers he came across and wanted nothing more than to be one of them. He trained relentlessly but to no avail. When he was 16 he was visited in a dream by a shadow. The shadow offered him greatness in exchange for his soul. He barely understood what a soul was or the cost of trading it, no matter the gain.  The experience left his body shattered, but his mind had been unlocked. Though he is but 29 years of age, anyone viewing him would guess him to be in his 80s. His hunched shoulders, constantly leaning on a staff, silver hair and wrinkled skin betray him. While most dismiss him as a non-threat the power he wields through The Great Old One is not to be taken lightly.  Since then he has been obsessed with 2 things alone. Increasing power and finding a way to get out of his bargain without loosing his current power."

Players arrive and a DM runs them through about an hour or two worth of encounters. Players are encouraged to make their own characters which will be saved on the server for future games. There are also many different pre-generated characters for players to choose from.  Level 10, standard point buy, 1 rare magic item, 3 uncommon items, 5 health potions, and any minor equipment you'd like. Make your own character and save it on the server!

I read your post - and you seem like a level headed person, which is definitely what I am looking for.  I'm going to be honest - it's been a couple years since I have played in this system. I really like it because it's story based - but still has simple combat rules to provide interesting conflict opportunities. But since it's been so long since I have played, I might be a bit rusty on the rules. Obviously I am going to study them before play - but I would never take it amiss if you called my attention to something I was not running right, or to a rule I just didn't know about. The only time I care about that is when it turns into role-mongering, and honestly, I find that is usually far and few between. Honestly, most people just want to help.  Right now you are the first person to express any interest, but I will be keeping people informed as more people sign on."

I realize you already have 5 people (if the first commenter's friend had come along) but I'm messaging now because I haven't had much success in finding a D&D game because I'm also 15, and have been looking to play for about a year but most people are picky about age.. Hoping that maybe I could join a future campaign you have or something? I haven't played before but am familiar with how it works and have read up (still am) on the rules and I've watched some shows and podcasts like Critical Role and Dungeons and Randomness (4e but still great). My skype is xvoltarx, panda pic, you'll know once you see it. Would love to hear from you!"

I have a basic understanding of the universe. Cyberpunk distopia, all the fantasy races are exotic mutations that sprung up one day. Everyone is more or less just a mutated human. Magic exists, but it works sort of like X-men mutation powers and doesn't mix well with Cybernetics because the magics are organic in nature.   there's a lot of future lingo, and everything that comes with the standard Cyberpunk genre.

lfg,3chnns,aldurljon,2,Wed Jul 8 04:09:43 2015 UTC,"I'm setting this story after the results of ME3, however some ""retcons"" were made.    Shepard destroyed the Reapers by choosing the ""destroy machines"" route, because that was the stupidest decision ever. There's no way they could destroy all machines, because a ******** crowbar counts as a machine. Plus, I'm following the Indoctrination theory that states the entire ending was Shepard's mind retreating in on itself during the Indoctrination process's final stage. They tried to deter shepard from destroying the Reapers by framing their kill switch as a lot more dangerous than it would be.  with the death of the Reapers, the rest of the world was able to rebuild the Mass Relays just fine, especially since information they could pull from the memory banks from the Reaper's corpses.  the Geth and Quarians are at peace and the Genophage was cured (just pointing out which life-altering choices were made by shepard"

Just so you know, it's relatively common for GMs to have an ""application"" process due to the extreme ratio between the numbers of GMs available and prospective players. It varies a little bit with the system you're using, but most systems have far more people wanting to play than GM.  It's not going to kill you to screen applicants to be sure that you're all on... the same page. It might slow down the arrival of the first session, but it will also dramatically increase the odds of you having a second one."
lfg,3chubj,veninvillifishy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:28:11 2015 UTC,No I don't. I'm actually a really social guy once I break the ice. Breaking the ice is what's hard. I will post something soon. Maybe I can start with a game I'm really familiar with first so it's not an issue and later move on to new games I want to try.
lfg,3chubj,horrorshowmalchick,2,Wed Jul 8 14:44:31 2015 UTC,"First of all, I want to use this as an excuse to thank reddit's DnD community, by way of the recommendation.  Of all the online groups I've ever been part of, based around any topic, these folks are hands down the most sharing and helpful. No one minds us 'stealing' each others' ideas, and this generous atmosphere encourages us to be more helpful to each other. It's really cool.  I'd suggest playing online on one of those roll20 jiggers they have now. Worst case scenario, you can Alt F4 and never see them again! :)  With regards to your adult themes bit, how dark were you thinking of going? As long as you preface the game with an 'R-rated' warning, you'll be covered for most anything short of representing sexual act with minors. As an example, Heroes of Horror details a scene in which a hag mind controls a bunch of abducted children to eat their living, naked friend. The victim calmly lies on the dinner table while they vivisect and consume her. Wherever the line is, that doesn't cross it."
lfg,3chubj,mrjinpengyou,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:43:15 2015 UTC,"Every group will be different for this so you can establish the rules in advance like ""Because we're playing Apocalypse World and there's a sex move in it, there will be sex but mostly in the high level 'We do it' and we fade to black and fast forward to the next scene"".  A powerful tool for this is the X card. It works with people you don't know too much but basically if someone is uncomfortable or wants us to move on because of a specific topic, you tap the X card. So if you hate spiders and the GM goes on describing how you are stuck in webs and the spider is crawling etc. the GM will simply stop describing too much and move on with the encounter. Online you can either say ""X Card"" or make a sign in the camera like a big X with your arms."

Also if you got accepted I'd be happy to help you with characters and such if you needed it but all in all just got to put your neck out there really. Most of the people are lovely that I have met from here and at worst you're just kinda going to feel ""That didn't go well, oh well"" and shrug.

Lately I haev an itch to play something divine (Cleric, Druid or paladin), but I am up to fill the roles that are needed.  Edit: I will pm you a couple of character ideas tonight after work, and you tell me what works."
lfg,3cgwch,rekreider16,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:51:58 2015 UTC,"Cleric or Paladin, would be best with what everyone else have been picking, can't wait to see what you come up with. :-)"
lfg,3cgwch,rekreider16,2,Wed Jul 8 01:18:59 2015 UTC,I would love to play! I am currently running my own home sessions that just started so Sundays and sometimes Mondays will be out for me. The rest of the week is fine since I am in Central Time Zone so that will put me 11 p.m. to your midnight. I've never used Roll20 myself but would love to start. Since it is Forgotten Realms I assume we will be using D&D? My recent experience is in Pathfinder and I have not done D&D in a few years so I will be rusty in that area.
lfg,3cgwch,rekreider16,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:55:00 2015 UTC,"I wanted to avoid weekends(I work some weekends) so that works. I have some 5th edition experience so thats what I'm going to start with, I don't mind learning with you, same for Roll20. I have lots of old forgotten realms supplement material, so my plan is to take the party all over. If you want to send me your pick for race & class , and a background and history I could work into my campaign. :-)"

lfg,3cgwch,SuperFog,3,Tue Jul 7 23:39:53 2015 UTC,"Looking over the players handbook, I have my class and race roughly decided but I need to know are we doing the 27 point buying, rolling on our own using the honor system, or just taking the standard provided scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8). The ability scores will determine where I go."

We try to stick to the rules, but it is a homebrew world and its a mostly, shoot from the hip sort of world, where it is almost entirely player driven. The world is filled in on an, ""as we go"" basis, but I am working on a side task called ""Dawn of Worlds"" where my current D&D group will get to act as primordial gods/forces creating a world including landscapes, etc, and we will eventually move into that world when the current game runs its course.  So yeah, this is definitely a long term situation if that is what you want."

I would like to have a group also capable of updating a couple times a day. You know, be able to get through 3 rounds of combat in a day would be sweet.  PM me if you are still interested, I'm on the west coast (PST/PDT)(UTC -7)  Edit: I didn't read your second paragraph. I can DM. I love the Forgotten Realms, so we will be based there. I have all the core books as well as the most approved homebrew from Reddit.  I am pretty lenient as far as DMs go. I will straight reward (unless the dice Gods hate you) creativity. I usually run NON-Balanced worlds. Why should the world grow with you. No. If you go sticking your neck in the wrong place at too early a level, you will encounter some big nasties.  I like campaigns where the moral choice is often construed and you don't really know if you're working for a good guy or a ""bad"" guy. Because people are prejudiced or liars you know? I've DMed 5e almost exclusively so I got a good grasp with the rules and whatnot.  My biggest con as a DM? I am a huge proponent for the DMPC. I don't necessarily need to play one, especially in this kind of setting, that would just be confusing... So yeah nevermind.   Obviously as a party, you will need to have good reason to be together, I don't care what kind of alignment you are, but if are stupid, you will be punished. Most of my campaigns are more traditional, save the blank and be heroes. I haven't done an evil campaign before, but it's not really my choice where you all decide to go with that."

InsidiousObserver's games have lots of twisty plots, some great setpieces,  and a certain inescapable logic to them. In the thick of things it's like ""what the hell is going on, why is this happening"", and then once you work things out it's like ""oh, we did this, which led to the bad guys doing that, and then this happened and of course everything went to shit"".

lfg,3cd3er,IamAnOddish,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:45:06 2015 UTC,Two things.   Why is the arcanist banned? The background of your site bleeds through the text and it's honestly very hard to see anything.
lfg,3cd3er,Mekchrious,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:33:13 2015 UTC,"Arcanist is banned because it is an overpowered class that dwarfs any other player in the party. It's too easy to pull off some crazy things with it and we don't want that kind of player that doesn't even need a party. The forum site is a work-in-progress, so we're in a continuous development on that front."
lfg,3cd3er,veninvillifishy,0,Tue Jul 7 04:00:57 2015 UTC,"Here, I'll translate it for everyone who doesn't speak Bullshit™:  They banned the Arcanist because there is no fun allowed and someone's mary sue conan clone got butthurt that he was no longer the sole character capable of accomplishing anything just by full-attacking and sucking the GM's dick."
lfg,3cd3er,veninvillifishy,0,Tue Jul 7 10:02:42 2015 UTC,"We have had bad personal experiences with players who have been allowed to use the arcanist class. It eventually boiled down to those particular characters pulling the ""I have a spell for that"" for every encounter, puzzle or situation. This meant that none of the other players in the party had a chance to shine. In combat, Wizards already are the top dog with their versatility of spells, but Arcanist takes it to a whole new level of damage output. Because of this, encounters are made harder simply because one guy can cheese mobs and bosses without even breaking a sweat. So it makes the encounters unfair for the rest of the party who don't have a chance to shine in their areas of expertise, n'or can they keep up damage, support or buffing... All because one guy has a spell for everything really. At least with our wizards and the wizard class in general, it's a lot more toned down.  We encourage fun and to try all sorts of things, but not when it costs the fun for every other player in your party. Your comment clearly shows that you don't understand what we're about. You're rude, insensitive and it spits on the few of us that are trying to build something nice, without a childish user like yourself trying to put things down. Your attitude promotes a toxic behaviour, and my own assumptions lead me to believe that you're just the same as a minmaxer or munchkin; because you want to play the most powerful classes in the game.  Try to be a little nicer to people and cease this disrespect towards people you don't even know."

Your problem with Wizards... is their damage output??! Seriously?!   Try to be a little nicer to people and cease this disrespect towards people you don't even know.   No. And your passive-aggressive projection can't make me, either.  My problem with you is that you're toxic and you're spreading misinformation and toxicity throughout the community with your irrational hatred, and restrictions on what everyone can do just because you didn't get along with a single player. It's ok if you're new to the game and you don't know how it works or anything, but that's not a reason to arbitrarily tell everyone else they can't play something because you don't understand it and don't like it.  You're toxic. You're new. You're ignorant. You're spreading it. Stop doing it, or just get comfortable with the ridicule that you've earned."
lfg,3cd3er,Leverette,0,Tue Jul 7 22:52:37 2015 UTC,"You're focusing on specific points in my post to make your own statements seem more valid. I don't see how I'm being toxic in the slightest: I brought up a couple of examples why Arcanist was not an allowed class.   Now you're seriously trying to derail the point of this post. If you simply don't like that our community has banned the Arcanist class, you don't have to enter ""keyboard warrior"" mode and try to ruin things for other people. That's completely selfish. The decision to ban Arcanist was not even my decision to make. I am here as a representative of the community to post here and look for other players who have like-minded opinions and ideas, who want to join in. The decision to ban certain classes and feats was based on a group decision.   The only one being ignorant here is you. You've insulted, cussed and tried to derail the thread, then when I respond you escalate the aggression. Your behaviour is truly disgusting and you don't even know me or the other players in the community that i'm a part of (AND THEY have NO problem with Arcanist not being included).   I have my fair share of experience with Pathfinder, and you making assumptions about people you don't even know, then insulting them based on those assumptions makes you look ridiculous. I never even expected someone like you would take things so personally when you simply didn't even have to post at all. You took my explanation to the other user and tried to twist it to something you don't even understand, because you were not there to experience what me and the rest of the players in our group experienced.   If anything, YOU have irrational hatred, YOU'RE ignorant and YOU'RE spreading toxic behaviour. Simply stop posting in this thread if you don't like the way things are. It is as simple as that."

As much Charisma, Int and Wisdom as able with at least 10 in constitution.   His Feat would be Spell Sniper His Patron would be The Great Old One and his Pact would be Pact of the Tomb.  In his younger days he adored the arcane weavers he came across and wanted nothing more than to be one of them. He trained relentlessly but to no avail. When he was 16 he was visited in a dream by a shadow. The shadow offered him greatness in exchange for his soul. He barely understood what a soul was or the cost of trading it, no matter the gain.  The experience left his body shattered, but his mind had been unlocked. Though he is but 29 years of age, anyone viewing him would guess him to be in his 80s. His hunched shoulders, constantly leaning on a staff, silver hair and wrinkled skin betray him. While most dismiss him as a non-threat the power he wields through The Great Old One is not to be taken lightly.  Since then he has been obsessed with 2 things alone. Increasing power and finding a way to get out of his bargain without loosing his current power."

The campaign's races and classes are built into eachother kind of. You can choose between Gavoner, Kessiger, Nephalin and Stensian. Gavoner and Stensian are like playing a paladin or any type of fighter. Rangers and druids are like Kessiger. Bards and rouges are Nephalin."

lfg,3c62t7,crunchym8,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:57:22 2015 UTC,"We play 5pm on saturdays and we do skype with theatre of the mind. Some homebrew included is the death exhaustion rule where if you hit 0 health and are healed back up you take one level of exhaustion, and in general many poisons where if you fail a save against it and do not use a health kit after combat also cause you to gain a level of exhaustion, but you have the option to make a poison DC medicine check to treat it as well. I also include unique magic items and some custom feats."

If you're going to end up close to the harbor then you're probably not too far from my music studio. Are you going to be running in Rockville still or will your game move to Baltimore?
lfg,3c50z5,catseatfood,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:43:54 2015 UTC,In Montgomery County. Running 5th biweekly. Looking for other gamers for more pen and paper or board games.
lfg,3c50z5,bm0re,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:23:17 2015 UTC,I'm free on Wednesdays and Thursdays.  I've played 3.0/3.5. Want to give 5 a shot.  I live in Glen Burnie and assume AA means Anne Arundel.  I not so recently moved to MD and still don't know where anything is.
lfg,3c515w,TheWhiteCrow,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:17:54 2015 UTC,I'd possibly be interested. However I have neither a copy of Tabletop Simulator nor the funds to acquire one. I'd also have to know what day/time the sessions are to be on. . If I do join I'll want to know if I can use the Green Ronin Advanced Players Guide (specifically the race customization section) in addition to the official WoTC books. . Probably would go for a Human (possibly modified) Battle Sorcerer 1 / Duskblade X (where X is the number of levels I gain past first) that takes tons of Draconic themed stuff such as the Draconic Feats from Complete Arcane and knowing the Draconic language.
lfg,3c515w,GamerGoddessDin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:16:03 2015 UTC,Hey there! Talked to my buddy who's DMing and he doesn't  think that'll work. Thabks though!
lfg,3c515w,GamerGoddessDin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:48:55 2015 UTC,"Which part won't work? I can work without the Green Ronin APG race customization stuff if it works better for them. Still probably be Human, just won't have Weapon Familiarity with the Bastard Sword like I would if the race customization rules were allowed."
lfg,3c515w,GamerGoddessDin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:07:29 2015 UTC,He's gotten less wishy washy on the tabletop sim part. He's decided that using tabletop sim is for sure the way he wants to go.
lfg,3c515w,Joshawa119,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:34:11 2015 UTC,"Oh, okay. Is it actually better than Roll20 for D&D?"
lfg,3c515w,freshrprince,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:41:43 2015 UTC,"To be totally honest, Roll20 is more optimized for D&D. The attractiveness of tabletop sim is that you actually get to play with a virtual tabletop. We've tried both, and even without the extra resources that Roll20 had, tabletop sim just feels so much more like you're actually at a table with your buddies for a game."
lfg,3c515w,andyumster,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:07:16 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in joining, though I don't have Tabletop Simulator and can't get a copy.  I'd play a CG halfling bard who doubles as a travelling merchant and enjoys playing pranks on people."
lfg,3c515w,programmerq,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:53:03 2015 UTC,"This sounds great and I would love to join, I have table top sim. I am brand new to table top RPGs so it make take a couple sessions for me to figure everything out though. And time 3-9pm MST works or weekends if scheduled ahead."
lfg,3c515w,AncientSpark,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:00:21 2015 UTC,"Hey!  I'm super interested. I'm in the PST and available pretty often. Although I am taking a couple of classes this summer, they should be easy to work around.  I don't have tabletop sim yet, but at twenty bucks its certainly doable, if I knew that I'd be in the group/that you are all cool cats.  If possible could you hit me up on skype or just through reddit pms so I could learn more about it? My username on here is the same as skype.  Also just for a bit of my experience, 3.5e is the only DnD I've played, but I have been the DM of a couple of games. I know all the basic rules and most of the advanced stuff, but that doesn't mean I plan on stepping on any toes. As a player (and a former DM) I'll remember the golden rule of the game: DM is god."

lfg,3c4pxu,GrandBreaker,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:25:25 2015 UTC,"Could you two (Grandbreaker and XryuhX) clarify if your intersted in DMing or playing.  Since if it's playing I'll have to give priority to nem,  him being first and all.   To answer your questions we'll be doing weathered the DM is most comfortable doing.  Personally i wouldn't mind something futuristic."
lfg,3c4pxu,XRyhuX,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:06:55 2015 UTC,I would prefer playing since i don't have a vast amount of eexperience as a dm ( only did it once ) but i could try to. It would take me a bit of time to read up on all the rules and prepare something but i'm not 100% against it.

I'd be willing to run a game almost any time between July 5th and July 10th. I'v never done a solo session (1 player + GM) but have wanted to try. That said, if a few other people want to learn D&D 5e I would be happy to teach (max of 4-5 players total please).  Now, I should say that I am by NO MEANS a D&D 5e expert (honestly, it has been out for such a short time I dont think anyone can claim that), but I have one long campaign and a few one-shots under my belt.

lfg,3c0ao3,TheCurrentCurator,2,Fri Jul 3 16:33:47 2015 UTC,"This has been my experience, so not a judgement on all players of nWoD. Whitewolf tends to appeal to a broad group of people and the words roleplaying mean different things. When you get involved with not face to face stuff, the divergent possibilities clash fast. Some like the sexual content, some are igged out by it, some hate politics, some want to do vampire game of thrones. I've seen a mummy & mage game that got people bickering over history so often and the odd non history majors got bored and left. Roleplay heavy with any whitewolf game means different things to different people, and it's hard to expect what crowd of strangers you will get online.  When you know people in real life and gaming groups and FLGS regulars, you can do it. Online... you need more than asking roleplay heavy. The only succesful World Of Darkness games online I've ever run that people agreed and enjoyed when it was over was World Of Darkness It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and telling people the theme/atmosphere would be based off House of Leaves. When people know exactly what they are signing up for it can be great, when it's just roleplay heavy there is a serious hesitation especially for whitewolf publications."
lfg,3c0ao3,MaimedJester,2,Fri Jul 3 23:05:20 2015 UTC,"Dungeon World might suit your needs.  Also: GURPS, Palladium, Call of Cthulhu (horror), or Savage World. Keep in mind that I know next to nothing about all of these systems. Pathfinder and D&D are more to my taste.  That being said, you could find a highly RP-heavy D&D/PF group. Yes, the game can get very crunchy (combat), but I've played through RP-heavy sessions where there was a dozen checks in total (mostly things like Bluff, Sense Motive and Search/Spot/Listen).  EDIT: Have you checked on /r/RPG wiki? Might also want to ask in there."

lfg,3c10ie,SirMackingtosh,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:44:21 2015 UTC,I am unsure what Pathfinder Society is. Unless you are saying you were with us and part of a Pathfinder game before? I ensure you I spend a lot of time making sure that everyone finds a game and feels welcome. I always suggest coming to me with any issues or questions.
lfg,3c10ie,scout238,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:56:05 2015 UTC,Is there any Warhammer 40k games currently running/being planned?
lfg,3c10ie,DeusExMundus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:12:36 2015 UTC,"We did have a Warhammer RPG game running, but I believe the DM stopped playing. I could work on recruiting some guys for 40k if you do join up."
lfg,3c10ie,Kaldurenik,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:17:49 2015 UTC,just signed up... been looking to start learning D&D (work in high energy physics so i figure i should learn it to complete the cycle haha) and have fun with a group of people (reminiscing my old MMO days)
lfg,3c10ie,DeusExMundus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:17:36 2015 UTC,Sounds good man!
lfg,3c10ie,Kaldurenik,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:54:29 2015 UTC,"I have a question about the ""Specific Recruitment"":  is that campaign already in play, or are they waiting for players to start?  I'm particularly interested in that one, since it's nigh impossible to find online groups that have schedules accessible to GMT/UTC timezones."
lfg,3c10ie,DeusExMundus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:20:46 2015 UTC,"Hello!  I'm the DM running Land's of Abberon, i'm still looking for people to join a Saturday session and i also need another 1-2 people (to make a balanced group) for my Friday session.  Edited and removed due to me giving the wrong times :D  If you have any more questions feel free to ask"
lfg,3c10ie,DeusExMundus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:11:42 2015 UTC,"First of all, congratulations for mentally violating me with all those timezones. I've been having exams on theoretical physics for the past 4 weeks and this is the most confused I've been.  My timezone is GMT+0 and I usually prefer to not do stuff past 3-4AM (23-24h EDT).  With this said, I'd gladly apply to join the Saturday Night Group, but I have the problem of being unavailable on the last Saturday of every month. If that is an issue, obviously, I understand since 75% attendance is... less than optimal.  I'm genuinely confused by ""19:00 Friday EDT -6 | 01:00 Saturday GMT+2 Saturday morning"". I presume that   19h Friday EDT-6 = 05h Saturday GMT+0 01h Saturday GMT+2 = 23h Friday GMT+0   If this is correct, I'd only be available for the latter option, if it ran for not longer than 5 hours (until 04h GMT+0).  If you were to hold a session on Sundays or Fridays (or any other day) before 04:00 GMT+0 it'd definitely fit my schedule.  I'm terribly sorry if I sounded confusing. If so, you can believe that this was twice as confusing for me."

lfg,3c0ou6,CrazyPlato,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:20:41 2015 UTC,I have never played before but really think i would enjoy it and could see myself getting into it. Would you guys possibly accept a newbie? depending on when you guys play
lfg,3c0ou6,HipHop__Opotamus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:33:50 2015 UTC,"That'd be fine with me. We're still working out the details, so it may take a while to get everything together. Why don't you pm me your FB profile, and I'll get a group together there to make planning a bit easier."
