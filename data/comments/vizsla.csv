Praise him when he does his business. This is the age where it begins to click that their business should be outside. Still a little early to scold him if he has an accident indoors. Also make sure the area is clean of other business, sometimes they won't go if they're having to step to much. I'd completely forgotten mine did this (she's 14mo) until I read your post. Just continue with the schedule and one day it will just stop. Also note the time you feed and the when he actually goes. See if there's a pattern. Maybe he needs a little more time, and the method above will reveal that."

The dog is awesome and sadly the previous owners didn't know what they were taking on. As an experienced vizsla owner, he has been the most awesome dog."
vizsla,3d9ds0,Fislin,4,Tue Jul 14 16:01:25 2015 UTC,"My wife manages to get things in strange ways. In 2006, we got a Vizsla from a local breeder, and had him for 6 months, but sadly, he got away from us, ran into the road, and was hit by a car.  Then we got a Weimaraner, and had him for about 8 months, and my wife decided to try to get a Vizsla as a gift for my father in law (he wanted a hunting dog).  So my wife looked far and wide, and eventually found a breeder in Texas (we lived in NYS at the time).  So this breeder was in the middle of a divorce.  The husband owned the father, some champion Vizsla that won something in 2005 (I really don't follow this type of thing, so I don't know any more than that), and the wife had two litters of puppies from her females.  Just to be mean to the husband, she was offering two options:    The puppies were for sale for $2500, with papers (and nobody was buying) The puppies were free, without papers   Learning of this, and since we weren't showing or breeding, we opted for ""free,"" and the only cost to us would be to fly the puppy from Texas to NYS.  When her siblings found out about the deal, two of them asked if we could also get them puppies, and they'd pay for the shipping.  Just before the puppies were to be shipped, the siblings back out, and my wife tells the woman in Texas to send just the one puppy.  Then, (for some reason I don't understand to this day) it was decided that we'd tell her dad about the dog, and that he'd go to the airport to pick up his puppy.  When he arrived at the airport, he was greeted by 3 Vizsla puppies, not the one he expected.  So now, he's pissed off, and we need to do something quick with the other two.  He knew a guy that wanted one, so he gave him one of the females, and then we were left with the male. Since we already had a male Weimaraner, they figured it would be best for us to foster the male V.    After about 2 weeks living with us, we realized that the ~5 month of V was a pretty good match for our 9 month old Weimaraner, and that it was actually easier to handle the two of them since they'd play together instead of bearing the brunt of a 9 month old weim all on our own.  The V had been perfectly behaved, and the three of us were standing in a hallway discussing what to do when I suggested that we keep him.  My wife agrees, and just then, the V pees on the floor for the first time in 2 weeks of living with us. I guess he knew he was finally at home.    7 and a half years later, and 1600 miles away (we moved to Colorado), we're all still one happy family."

Trying to save a few bucks on your pup can cost you down the road.  I would find the breeder you feel comfortable buying from and pay their asking price.  A reputable breeder may have several thousand into the breeding before the dogs ever hit the floor.

vizsla,3d6tai,exposur3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:54:02 2015 UTC,It's pretty standard actually and was recommended by the breeder.  http://redbirddog.blogspot.com/2011/08/art-of-nail-trimming.html  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RRIlgYr1zY
vizsla,3d6tai,beavizsla,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:35:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's extreme, so much as requires a little more work to get them used to it, but really, is safer, as you take off less at a time. So if you do hit the quick, it's much less than if you lop off a chunk of nail and hit the quick, which hurts more, and will bleed profusely.  Pros:  • Neater and can round edges • Can get closer to the quick without hitting it, therefore, shorter nails  Cons:  • Requires available electricity for corded ones, or a charged battery for cordless- cordless also have less power • Often loud • Must be careful not to hold the dremel at the nail for too long, as the friction can be very uncomfortable and even hurt them. • Harder to get them to tolerate due to noise and feeling  Personally, I use both, especially if I'm cutting long nails on a dog. Cut them as short as I can safely cut them with nail clippers, then dremel them to round it off and get as close to that quick as possible."

I'm glad you are not running with your puppy, wait till she is full grown so she won't damage her growing leg bones.  Continual training with V's. Yes they are smart and yes they will test you.

vizsla,3cex66,raft_man,3,Tue Jul 7 11:21:02 2015 UTC,"Hey there.   I work at a boarding kennel! Some things I'd recommend sending with him are his own blanket or one of your tshirts - something that smells like home - and some kind of ""busy toy"" like a Kong and appropriate treats to go in it.  There's usually a lot of activity at these places, and if it's Whitman's first time away from home he might have trouble sleeping with all the coming and going. So it's a good idea to provide him with a fun, healthy activity for his down time.   Check the weather. Are there supposed to be storms? Maybe send benadryl and some pill pockets. Also, if he's on any medication, include detailed instructions on dosages and times it should be given. Consider one of those daily pill sorters like people use.  If there's a particular ritual you have, like having him sit and giving it as a treat, or hiding it in peanut butter and throwing it in his bowl with his food, let them know that, too! That kind of info makes our lives SO much easier!   We always ask that people send along the dog's own food, to minimize upset tummies, and make sure you mention any allergies or food sensitivities Whitman has. I know they're pretty common in vizslas!   The other thing I'd recommend is that you please mark things with your or his name and keep a list of what you sent along, just to make sure it all comes back! Where I work we try very hard to keep a dog's stuff together but things happen. Maybe his blanket ends up in the laundry and the next shift doesn't recognize it. So please, help us help you!   This comment got very long, but please feel free to ask any other questions you might have. We have several vizslas who board regularly and they all do great... possibly because nobody can resist loving on them at every opportunity ;)"

vizsla,3bd4us,Shinkaru,3,Sun Jun 28 02:21:01 2015 UTC,Have you tried crate training?  There are plenty of videos out there on how to do it.  I like the train positive channel for stuff like this.  You can train your dog to like the kennel.  Start with small amounts of time and work your way up.  Eventually the dog will see the kennel as a safe comfy place to relax.  My male has some serious separation anxiety and many times I would leave him in the kennel and find him perfectly relaxed and calm upon my arrival.
vizsla,3bd4us,whitemagic420,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:30:05 2015 UTC,"You can train your dog to like the kennel. Start with small amounts of time and work your way up.   This is what I was going to say. Ms. Bacon loves the crate. If I so much as grab my car key after taking her out, she runs right to the crate waiting for a treat and to be locked it. It's also where she goes when a bad storm (or the vacuum) has her spooked. It's like her little safety cave."
vizsla,3bd4us,bejessica,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:10:11 2015 UTC,"We have tried to do this before, but failed miserably.   For some reason, though, it's working this time. We found that she goes into her crate to lay down or sleep during the day, which is really unusual. In the past, she'd avoid it like the plague and freak out whenever we put her in."
vizsla,3bd4us,honky_vizsla,3,Tue Jun 30 23:57:38 2015 UTC,I'm sorry to hear your little vizsla is getting to distressed! I watched this ted talk about mental issues in animals - the speaker did comprehensive research and wrote a book about why her dog had separation anxiety. Hope it helps! https://www.ted.com/talks/laurel_braitman_depressed_dogs_cats_with_ocd_what_animal_madness_means_for_us_humans?language=en
vizsla,3bd4us,honky_vizsla,2,Mon Jun 29 12:53:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, your circumstance is pretty extreme, so I'm going to wade in here and offer advice, some of which is certain to be controversial.   Crating, as suggested by others, is an excellent idea.   We occasionally crate our 7 year old female when the circumstances dictate.  She was not crate  trained as a puppy, and she does just fine.  She sleeps or just chills.  Make sure you get informed advice on the proper dimensions.   There is such a thing as too big, as well as too small. Get a high quality bark collar.  Sportdog makes the best bark and field training collars. They are what hunters use, and not cheap.  They can be purchased on amazon.    I have personally tested the field collar on my arm, adjusting the shock strength through its range.  It starts with something like a tap, on a higher setting a  small sting, then a slightly larger sting, until you reach a max that I would call thoroughly unpleasant.    (To all that are poise to reply about how these collars are ""electrocuting"" or ""torturing"" animals...speak up if you have also tried it on yourself.)  Nothing makes our dog happier that seeing the field collar.   She knows she is going outside off leash.   It has really opened up her world.     Hope this helps!"
vizsla,3bd4us,Lydkraft,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:45:55 2015 UTC,"We have a Sportdog collar we used when she was barking at the neighbors, but they explicitly say no to use it for separation anxiety. Any idea why that is?   I'm also nervous about leaving her alone with it on. Have you left the collar on your dog while you were away?"
vizsla,3bd4us,libbyvizsla,2,Tue Jun 30 23:54:59 2015 UTC,"We do use the bark collar sometimes when away so that she doesn't bark at dog walkers all day long.  She worries when we leave, but is not panicked.   I guess it's possible that if your dog is panicked, she will bark despite the collar, which wouldn't be good.  Certainly something you would take care in testing.  Our dog's neuroses is storm anxiety.  Left to her own devices she will find a corner, or a bed, or a cardboard box, and will dig compulsively.   You would not believe the damage she can do in the couple of minutes it takes to find her.   We use thundershirt, crating...but what helps most?   A leash.   She is MUCH less anxious when she knows she is not alpha.   FWIW.  Time will help too.   Our vizsla has become more chill as she has grayed.    Good luck to you!   You sound like awesome doggie people."

vizsla,3ak5rt,Lydkraft,6,Sun Jun 21 00:12:01 2015 UTC,It's there natural instinct to want to lead and they are stubborn enough that they will choke themselves to do just that.

vizsla,3ak5rt,Stu_Pidasso,2,Sun Jun 21 14:13:35 2015 UTC,"If it's any consolation, I have 13 month old girl and was in the same boat. She heeled wonderfully with excellent eye contact, but pulled endlessly when on a normal walk. I don't believe you actually stated what part you were struggling with, but be consistent with whatever it is. If it's pulling, as soon as there's ANY tension, correct her every time. If it's getting her to heel properly, there are many alternatives. Also remember dogs can easily reenact a trick in the same setting (home), but they don't truly know it until they can do it elsewhere."
vizsla,3ak5rt,Grimk,2,Sun Jun 21 15:08:46 2015 UTC,"I know my practice isn't the perfect one, but I can walk a constant pace to and from a park and my recently operated mother (hip replacement about 8 month ago) can walk him too.  I'm using and extendable leash and a harness. When he starts to pull I just simply stop him, pick him up gently with the harness and turn him around to the direction where we were coming from. And just simply tell him to sit for 1-2 minutes. He always wants to continue the walk, but I don't let him. Only when he's relaxed we can walk again.  The other thing I'm doing is that I sign him with a gentle pull on the leash that he has to slow down. Try to use it a bit of a ""communication device"" if you understand what I mean.   After about 6 month I only have to turn him around about once or twice a week when he's really erratic, unpredictible but that's just a vizsla thing."
vizsla,3ak5rt,gravespinner,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:35:03 2015 UTC,I think she would be happier on an extendable but I need her close as I live in the center of a large city. But turning directions every time she starts to pull has been the only mildly successful method I've tried. I think I'll work on this more. Thanks.
vizsla,3ak5rt,whitemagic420,2,Sun Jun 21 14:17:02 2015 UTC,"Extendable or flexi leads should be banned. If your dog ever bolts and pulls the lead out of your hand, they will usually run in panic mode because of this noisy thing chasing them. There was a video on /r/roadcam a month ago that was filmed by a motorcycle and you could hear the lead bouncing behind the dog. Then if they get into bush the long lead gets wrapped around trees until they have no movement. I work with AARF, a group that finds lost pets, and we have several pictures of instances like this."
vizsla,3ak5rt,AquaSoxx,2,Sun Jun 21 21:32:45 2015 UTC,"Take a look at kikopup's loose leash walking videos. She has 10 different ones to look through so you can find exactly what it is you're struggling with, and maybe even take your training to the next level.  https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7287C737FB745168  I am not a fan of correcting a dog's bad behavior because it can lead to a reactive dog. Instead, I like to train the dog to perform the correct behavior using positive reinforcement, so that in the future, the dog will always choose to do the right behavior because she was rewarded in the past. Kikopup uses clicker training, so if you're unfamiliar with that, take a look at her intro videos to get an understanding of the basics behind it.   I'm not saying other ways of training are not valid, like using an e-collar, but personally, I want to rely on the dog to make the right choice and feel confident on a walk rather than to punish the unwanted behavior every time and cause the dog to fear me.   Good luck! It takes a lot of patience, but it's so worth it!"

But, the smell was very elusive: I would get a brief whiff, and then never smell it again.  I eventually tracked it down to one of these cow hooves. It was really disgusting.  Of course, Vi loved it. Even so, I stopped getting them. The smell was bad, and I was not sure how good they were for her."
vizsla,3a8bq7,youknowdamnright,3,Sat Jun 20 14:44:07 2015 UTC,"We use Taste of the Wild, and our two other friends with V's also use it. We switch up the formulas to give some variety. ALl the dogs seem to do well on this brand. I've heard the salmon one gives them some stinky gas occasionally, but we don't typically get that one.  As for treats, our dog loves veggies. When we trim the bottoms off asparagus or sweet potatoes, she really likes that. Dried sweet potatoes make some great treats too."
vizsla,3a8bq7,MrHydra,2,Thu Jun 18 13:56:52 2015 UTC,We use Nature's Variety. I forget what we started with but this has been consistently good and trouble free food. Summer really likes the freeze dried chunks they have in there.
vizsla,3a8bq7,MrHydra,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:37:06 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply.  Is it widely available?
vizsla,3a8bq7,hoadlck,2,Thu Jun 18 13:17:02 2015 UTC,That I'm not sure about. We get it from Petsmart
vizsla,3a8bq7,Stu_Pidasso,2,Thu Jun 18 15:16:00 2015 UTC,"I used to get Yeti Dog chews for Vi. They would last a long time, and she really loved grinding her teeth against them. They are really great.  The problem was that eventually she figured out how to crack them into pieces.  And then (of course) she would eat the whole thing immediately. Because, if something is worth doing, it is even more worth doing at 5 times the speed. And then she would throw it up an hour of so later.  I would definitely try these when Ygritte starts teething. If you can keep her from learning the trick of breaking them apart, they provide long hours of distraction."
vizsla,3a8bq7,MoodyJudy710,2,Sat Jun 20 14:52:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion, we will try them.  When our bullies were teething, we would soak washcloths, roll them up and then freeze them.  They were definitely a hit but eventually they wanted something with some flavor."
vizsla,3a8bq7,qxrs,2,Sat Jun 20 16:05:19 2015 UTC,"If she's around 8 weeks, 1 pig ear was overkill it took mine 3 days to finish one. If you already know which one is coming to live with you, ask the breeder to make sure it gets plenty of playtime before hand, and don't let it eat until right before you leave. That way odds are stacked in your favor that they'll sleep the whole way. I did this and was able to drive home without any fuss."

vizsla,3a34no,bilbo6209,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:04:33 2015 UTC,are you referring to the hip flexor tendon? Our Beagle Basset just got over this in her back rt leg...  Our Vet put her on K-Phen (K9 nsaid) for 7 or 10 days and then we gave her a baby aspirin (yes on Vets orders ) 2x a day as need for maybe a week of so (morning and night) and then down to 1x daily at night then down to just as needed after she used her leg a lot and  she is back to her old self again now and tearing back and forth along with the fence line with the V mix that lives behind us behind us LOL  If you want to go the baby aspirin route to help with the pain a bit make sure you get the BUFFERED ones!!! so they are easier on your little guys tummy!   Tendon pulls just need time to to heal (unless they are torn and then might need to be immobilized or surgery to heal correctly). If it is just a sprain/strain time is the best and your buddy just needs a little help with the pain :)

I had never seen the breed before. I realized when I was leaving the job how much I was going to miss all of them and that I didn't dislike any of them. It means a lot when the ""worst"" dog of a breed at daycare is still a really awesome dog. I really bonded with them and now I'm hoping to get one in a year or so after I move :)"
vizsla,39uoau,lexarexasaurus,3,Mon Jun 15 00:44:00 2015 UTC,"I never knew of the breed before my SO told me about them either. Then, when you know about them, you see them in ads everywhere. Of course, it's because they're such a handsome dog!   Good luck with your journey for a vizsla! We looked around for breeders for awhile, then, when we found one, we had to wait until they bred the next bitch. In the whole scheme of things, we've only been waiting since January, but that's so long when you want a puppy! Now, our little guy will be here in 34 days, and we couldn't be happier! We are so prepared; he has a toothbrush, a giant pile of all kinds of toys, and a dremel for his nails, just to name a few things.   What area do you live in? Maybe people can give you breeder reccomendations?"

But if anyone had recommendations it would be appreciated :)  I have already been pinteresting, etsying, you name it ... It sucks because I'll probably be nesting for about a year while I acclimate to life in the city and make sure I can take one on (especially financially) but I know I'll be missing the vizsla jogs and cuddles.

vizsla,39uoau,madmadammom,3,Wed Jun 17 18:49:17 2015 UTC,"When I first started looking at breeds I wanted an active dog with little/no grooming requirements. I love Labs but some of them can give me allergic reactions. I thought I wanted a Weim, but was a little worried as some of them get fairly large, and all of the ones I know are a little wigged-out and sketchy.  Every time I went to one of those ""what breed is good for you"" thing, the little red furballs kept popping up. I definitely made the right choice. On the other hand, I can see how Vizslas definitely aren't ideal for everybody."

I know what you mean about that. Sometimes, I'll describe to someone what the breed is like, and I mention that they are ""demonstrably affectionate"" and I can see their face change a little. Some people like dogs in their face, on the couch, under the covers, but I can see just as well that some people would not enjoy that."

Never made a peep the entire drive to or from Colorado.

vizsla,39uoau,youknowdamnright,3,Mon Jun 15 14:37:29 2015 UTC,my favorite thing about the vizsla's is the utter lack of dog smell. The velcro tendencies get to be a bit much sometimes (especially when there is thunder!) but I wouldn't trade him for anything.

I had a boss that had vizslas, so I knew I wouldn't have a bad reaction to them and I loved the lack of grooming that was needed. Ours is 5 months old now and I have absolutely zero regrets. His personality is awesome and everyone that meets him falls madly in love with him.  I do get hives when he gets too lovey on me, but not enough to really bother me. Best decision ever!"

When I first saw his Vizsla I fell in love.  Their temperment, their athleticism, intelligence, and of course their hunting ability had me hooked.  I have two now and love them.  I don't know if I can ever see myself without one.  They are the most observant,  loving, and expressive dogs I have ever been around, and my parents bred golden retrievers when I was young.   They definitely are not for everyone and require serious exercise and attention."

I wanted a working dog that was active since I like to run and whatnot. Our friend told us about Vizslas. She is a distance runner and she said how cuddly they were so my wife was on board.  Also, they don't shed too much, so it was a good choice on all fronts. I couldnt imagine getting another breed at this point.  I didnt end up hunting with her, but we do quite a bit of running and swimming. She does have a great nose and hunting instinct. I can hide dead birds for her and she will go find them and bring them back, but I havnet actively shot over her."

You will find people that can help guide you in training your dog, or just train your dog for you.  People think their vizsla is happy at the dog park, but they truly come alive when they are hunting.  You will never see your dog happier than when it is on the hunt pointing game.  Even if you  don't want to hunt you can do hunt test or trials.  I have seen so many people decide to take up Hunting after seeing their dogs hunt and truly understanding this is what they were bred to do."

vizsla,38uh6v,mebehappy,2,Sat Jun 13 15:32:47 2015 UTC,"When I picked mine up from the breeder at 8 weeks,  they had already docked his tail.  So if you are really concerned about it, make sure to find a breeder that doesn't do it right away."
vizsla,38uh6v,beavizsla,2,Sun Jun 7 02:05:45 2015 UTC,"NO!   If the tail is to be docked, it needs to be done at only a few days old. Otherwise, bones will calcify, tendons and nerves will mature and develop, and what is a simple procedure now turns into a major and painful surgery.   If one wants a dog without a dock, they need to establish a relationship with a breeder prior to the litter being whelped, and can request that a pupply be left natural. Of course, depending on the breeder's reasons for breeding a litter, if they are [likely] keeping one for themselves, it can be very difficult to tell which one(s) may or may not develop into a puppy they are looking to keep when they are only a few days old. Which is why, if you are hoping to get a ""natural"" tailed dog, you either establish a relationship with your breeder early so they are more likely to work with you, or you can import a dog from a country where docking is not allowed, and therefore not done.   However, keep in mind that the dock on a vizsla was developed for a reason, and a working dog is more likely to develop injuries to it's tail than a docked dog. Sometimes these injuries may be severe enough or develop complications that require eventual amputation of the tail, which, once again, is then a major surgery with a difficult and painful healing process."
vizsla,38uh6v,mebehappy,2,Mon Jun 8 04:17:19 2015 UTC,That's what I was trying to say.  I worded it badly. Find a breeder that doesn't dock the tails.
vizsla,38uh6v,JemLover,2,Mon Jun 8 04:20:05 2015 UTC,"Slightly off topic but I believe the tail is docked for health reasons.  A skinny, bony tail can be injured easily.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong please."
vizsla,38uh6v,Klompy,0,Sun Jun 7 01:09:35 2015 UTC,"They're docked for hunting purposes as the tail swinging through the brush could potentially hurt it. If you're not planning on using your Viz for hunting or constantly running through thick brush, there's really no reason to have it docked."
vizsla,38uh6v,whitemagic420,0,Sun Jun 7 01:12:48 2015 UTC,Many dogs bust or break them wagging them in the house.  Although I would agree that the purpose of docking is mainly for hunting.  Europeans don't dock their dogs tails and they seem to be ok.
vizsla,38uh6v,Abby01010,5,Sun Jun 7 03:39:22 2015 UTC,"Don't dock the tail, there's no reason to. Mine has her tail and she is perfectly happy. It's just an unnecessary cruelty if you're just having the vizsla as a pet, not a hunting dog."
vizsla,38uh6v,whitemagic420,2,Sun Jun 7 11:32:10 2015 UTC,"Tails are normally docked when the pups are just a few days old, so this should be something you arrange with your breeder."
vizsla,38uh6v,qxrs,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:36:39 2015 UTC,Our bitch used to wag her tail so hard that it would hit things and then started to bleed.  It would never heal so we were forced to get it docked in the end.  Best thing to do would be to speak to your local vet to see what they say.
vizsla,38uh6v,HensonTX,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:24:30 2015 UTC,Our breeder docks tails around a few days old. We were on the waiting list for about 9 months. I remember she would take requests to not dock the tail if you asked. This is in Texas.

vizsla,38uh6v,whatgeorgemade,0,Sun Jun 7 02:31:13 2015 UTC,"A photo of an undocked tail? Why sure! http://imgur.com/57jjo7w She's under there somewhere. Loves being as warm as possible whether it's in the sun or under a blanket.   The tail is a liability. It's also amazing. Imagine a 15 inch long rat tail. Now imagine it wagging furiously when Daddy gets home. It almost stings when you get smacked by it. I'd be devastated if she wounded it and had to have some of it removed though. So much communication from tail wags.   My 17 month old son has learned to steer clear of the dog's rear, much like one does around horses. He also covers his face whenever she trots past him, having been tail-whipped in the past. The dog has in turn learned to give the boy a wide berth, having been scalded for tail-whipping him!  Over here in England, a lot of Vizlek are still docked but it is because the dog works or is from working stock. Our bitch is from show stock so kept her tail.   I'll see if I can find a better photo on my laptop. That's the first one I found of her with her tail in the frame and I thought it was too charming to not post!  Update: Found one! http://imgur.com/vgEq9qH"
vizsla,38uh6v,AmaHenry,0,Sun Jun 7 22:02:40 2015 UTC,"So... here's my input! :)   Where I live, it's now illegal to dock tails and remove dew claws. It wasn't a big deal to me because we don't use Leela for hunting and I've never understood people who do it for ""aesthetics"". So we got our little energy ball and right from the beginning her tail was always curled. Completely looped up over her back. No one has ever seen anything like it. The breeder has been having issues with tails curling upward (and actually had to remove Leela's brother from her breeding program because his curled too much), but not into a tight circle. I personally think it's adorable, and many people compliment it for how cute they think it is.   So here is a picture of Leela's tail... she essentially uses it as a barometer for her feelings. If she's sad or scared or hurt, the tail relaxes downward. So if she runs into something or hits something, we always check her tail position. If it's curled up she's ok, if not then we know we have something we need to deal with.   I would have her no other way :)"

He's learning, he's growing, he's doing fine. That being said, yes, I am in over my head. No amount of research could prepare me for this. I have thought about finding a new home for him, but that would be an extreme. Idk if im going to study abroad, but I'm not gonna give up an opportunity like this for a dog (yes, i said it). I will deal with the problems of being away from the puppy for a few months after I get back from seeing Europe.

Even if you aren't running him (be careful running too much when they are young and if you can trail run more then street run that's always best). We do 2-3 runs a week with ours as well as long walks and some Frisby/park time on days we don't run.    As far as being worried about your v destroying your house while your gone... get a crate and crate train your dog early.  Then when you're gone the dog won't be able to destroy anything.  If you think about it, when your gone the dog will spend 95% of the time sleeping and 5% of the time destroying stuff.  That crate will eliminate that 5%."

Mine seems to have some anxiety issues, like with wind and thunder, so it's nice that he has a place to go where he feels safe.  My weimaraner is much less of a fan of the crate.

We drape a blanket over the crate and put a few in the crate and our youngest finds a way to slither under the blankets and will sleep for hours.  When he's tired, he'll choose his crate about a third of the time.  Point is, dogs tend to like the protection they feel when in a 'cave'.  Play with him when he's out.  Let him be out and about the whole time you're home, be as active (or not even quite as much) as you said you are and you shouldn't have a problem...  Vs are very sensitive.  NEVER hit one or even act like you're going to.  Besides being a generally ineffective way to train a dog, aggressiveness toward a V is more damaging that I have ever seen in other breeds.

Besides being a generally ineffective way to train a dog, aggressiveness toward a V is more damaging that I have ever seen in other breeds.    We rescued a second V last year and I'm pretty sure he was hit and abused. After 6 months of training and patience, we had to finally give him back after he bit me, my wife and my son and drew blood on all of us. He also never gave any signal. Just leap and bite.  It was very hard for us, because the dogs are part of our family, but I have little kids and their friends who come over and we couldn't risk it.

vizsla,37q3pu,SomeRandomMax,2,Fri May 29 15:47:53 2015 UTC,"/u/theyev is spot on here. Vizsla's are wonderful dogs and as long as you get them exercised they will be your best friend ever.  Don't feel bad about the crate. As long as you don't make it seem like punishment, most dogs love it. it is ""their space"". The crate doesn't even need to be big, dogs are surprisingly ok with the small space. Bigger is probably better, but left to their own, most dogs will find a small space like a doghouse to sleep in anyway-- the crate is just their private indoor dog house,"
vizsla,37q3pu,Jimbozaaa,0,Sat May 30 12:12:10 2015 UTC,"Don't feel guilty about crate training. They naturally love it, it keeps them safe and prevents them damaging stuff. We have a crate that is about 5ft by 4ft and the Garbo has plenty of room. With regards to exercise, just make sure that on average you can give him 3-4 hours a day. Some days he'll get more, some days he'll get less, but on average this. It won't hurt them if one day they only get 30 minutes, so don't go doing anything stupid like buying a treadmill. And you don't have to 'build up his endurance', he's a gun dog and will run all day no problem. If you think you have to use a treadmill then it would suggest that you don't have time for a vizsla, because they do need a lot of stimulation. Also, vizslas will hang out at home but out and about its very diffcult to get them to settle. They are not really very good at sitting under the table whilst you have a beer as they want you to play with them and give them tasks/work to do.  If you do get one, learn all about clicker training. Read up on it and dog training in general. They are super smart and you can get them to do all sorts of cool stuff and they love it."
vizsla,37q3pu,-ipseDixit-,3,Mon Jun 1 12:42:30 2015 UTC,Find a close dog park and/or a dog walker.  Find a place you can run off leash- practice the come command. I crate-trained for a year but now I trust him (if the garbage isn't smelly). Your personal mileage will increase owning this dog: I went from 10K to marathon...
vizsla,37q3pu,Jag-,2,Sat May 30 13:11:29 2015 UTC,"Vizsla owner now in a house with a big yard, but I had a Weim in a NYC apartment that my wife ran with alot. Unfortunately he was bored and destructive during the day when we were at work despite all the exercise. These are very companionable breeds. They really need to be with their humans.   The V is a fantastic outdoor companion. He will love the runs and hikes (although make sure he is old enough before you start running the 7 miles. My V limps if he runs too much).   Your active lifestyle is perfect for a Vizsla, but I do worry about about being cooped up in an apartment.   The breed is fantastic with children especially if they bond when the puppy is young. They will be a family member for life. Can't speak about how they are with cats, but they are a hunting breed!  I wouldn't do the treadmill. It sounds dangerous. If the dog won't be alone for hours on end, it should be ok. But they will be bored and will need some running time every day."
vizsla,37q3pu,youknowdamnright,2,Fri May 29 14:53:23 2015 UTC,"V's are great around kids and cats, especially since it will grow up around them as a puppy. they will love the energy of the kid, and will be a good way for the dog and kid to burn off some energy playing. Just teach them both what is OK play and what is not.  Crate the dog in the early years (1-2yrs) and expand their area as you see fit. Mine was behaving nicely with freedom and then went nuts on a couch cushion one day. She is much better now and she has her own room at our new house. Puppies will be puppies and its best for their sake and your sake if you keep them crated while you are away. Dogs really dont mind the space restrictions. It's not punishment, it's their den. The breed loves being in a den (always wants to be under covers/blankets).  As for exercise, the most critical is the first 2-3yrs. If we didnt exercise her daily, then she was off the walls. I regularly took her to a field nearby to run off leash, or went on long walks and eventually longer runs when she was old enough. Off-leash play is the very best. they can run and run and run and run until their heart's content. I ran in the rain, snow, hot, cold, they do well in many conditions but some are more sensitive to cold, though.  If the weather is really bad and you guys stay in, just try to play fetch around the house. throw a ball down a hallway, hide stuff for them to search out and find. Keep their mind active and that will help tire them out.  My girl is about to turn 4 and for the past year or more, she has been so much more calm than the first 2 years. Now, she is more content with matching our mood. If we are feeling lazy, she will just lay with us, but we still try to play around a little. The first couple years are the most critical to keep them occupied and not destructive. I know some people that put theirs on a treadmill every night to burn off energy."

vizsla,37q3pu,yaychristy,2,Thu Jun 4 23:18:36 2015 UTC,"Do you think your dog would be bored / destructive in these circumstances? The apartment is a little over 1000 sq ft and a pretty open layout.   No. I live in a 900 square foot townhouse. Considering that Ms. Bacon never wants to be more than 4 inches from me, the size of the house really means nothing.  As to yards, I was worried about that, too (I only have a courtyard). My dog is NEVER more sad than when there's some sort of barrier between her and us. We spend a lot of weekends at a cabin in the woods where she's off leash and has the whole world to roam. If she's outside and we're inside, she'll stand by the door staring inside until we come out. She doesn't ""run around"" like you think she might. If she's out, she wants us out.   How active are you with your dog? I was thinking of putting in a treadmill and letting him run for a bit every evening. Building his endurance and letting him get some of the energy out, but do you think that might be enough?    I try to get her outside and off the leash 4-5 times a week. Swimming is great too.  On days I can't get her out, I try to take her in the car when I'm running errands or doing whatever. I'll also spend a half hour or so making her find treats or doing some obedience in the house. A little dedicated, personal attention goes a long way when we can't exercise.   Basically I'm looking for a dog that will be running with me on most evenings but wont mind hanging out and watching TV on the days I'm not going anywhere.   You'll be fine. Just don't try actually putting your hand on the remote when the dog is there. You'll get a hand full of nose instead!"
vizsla,37q3pu,-ipseDixit-,2,Fri May 29 21:00:07 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would never have a V without a yard. They need the stimulation of the outdoors and exercise.   They're often good around cats, I had 2 cats with mine and the female cat and him curled up often. He and the male cat ignored each other.   They are an anxious breed and the anxiety worsens the less exercise they have. Keep that in mind when having them around children. I would highly recommend obedience school. They need to be focused.   Regarding crating, I skipped it. Tried it for a week but V's are pretty adamant about sleeping in bed with their owner. Don't be surprised if you end up with them under your covers snuggling."
vizsla,37q3pu,bennylope,2,Sat May 30 02:23:10 2015 UTC,I have no yard but live two blocks from the park. It's all about the exercise and how to get it in. Love finds a way.
vizsla,37q3pu,aulusagerius,1 point,Sat May 30 13:12:26 2015 UTC,Regarding crating I think it depends on how the dog is trained to use the crate. Our {W}V loves to cuddle on the couch and the bed but when its bed time he'll moan at this crate if the door is closed. It's also in our bedroom which may make it more welcoming for him.
vizsla,37q3pu,pushad,5,Sat Jun 13 15:42:44 2015 UTC,"I own a 9 month old Vizsla and I can tell you that I find what is usually said (and written) about their need of exercise is highly exaggerated.  I'm not sure if it's maybe an American breeder thing but my Mia (she's from Hungary, we're from Austria) definitely does not need ""that"" much exercise. Sure, she's a a Vizsla, she won't be tired after a 15 minute walk but as long as you can invest around 1,5 hours a day she/he will be fine imo. And I'm not talking fast jogging, I'm talking normal walking, sniffing and some dog park action or off-leash time (I find that she enjoys that the most).  What I've actually heard a lot is that they will be fine with a level of exercise that they get used to. Sure it can't be comically little, but as I said, you don't have to run 3 hours a day. I think the rumors about their high need of extensive exercise are actually a vicious circle: people driven by these rumors will make large quantities of exercise a daily habit and of course the dogs will get used to it and demand it. I think this misconception is actually caused by the fact that Vizslas hardly ever get tired if they are entertained (!) and need some minutes to come down after a longer walk. So when you see your dog going crazy for 5 minutes after a walk, it's not because he/she still needs exercise, it's because he/she has a hard time processing all the impressions made during the walk, this is especially true with younger dogs. In these cases I'd recommend helping them to calm down and put them on their favourite spot to sleep. You literally have to help them relax, they usually should sleep around 18-20 hours a day. To wrap it up: If you go the right way and only offer them as much exercise as you're willing to provide regularly, they will be fine with that. More (3h+) exercise won't hurt them of course, but they'll demand it once they get used to it and built up the endurance.   We live in a (large) flat and don't have a garden but she is in no way destructive or anything like that, our breeder said that she has absolutely no worries letting her dogs live in flats as long as there are good places around to walk the dog (we have a wood, several dog parks, and normal parks nearby).  She is great with kids and other Vizslas we know are as well. If your dog gets used to cats as a puppy he/she will be fine with them as well. Mia is pointing at every bird she sees outside but we have actively encouraged that (looks too cute) and she's actually from a hunting breeder so there's that.   What I think you should know is that, at least that's the case with Mia, they are very clingy. The term ""velcro dog"" is often used for Vizslas for a reason. She loves being near us and hates being alone. When running freely, she always looks around to check if we are still in sight. So what I'm trying to say is that you need to be there for them a lot, but from my experience they are as happy running by your side as they are chilling under the blanket beside you while you watch TV on a rainy day. They just want to be close. Very close."
vizsla,37q3pu,liontheguardian,2,Fri May 29 17:40:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I have a V, and I don't really take him for walks. I do have a big back yard and woods he runs through (REALLY fast). During the winter though, he didn't spend nearly as much time outside... And some nights he doesn't. We play with him in the house though, he does laps and runs around. We rough house, and play fetch with him and he goes nuts.  Eventually he gets tired, and plops down on the couch and he's out for the night.  Most nights in the summer though, he goes outside for at least 1-2 hours a night.  And yeah. Be prepared for the velcro aspect. They will ALWAYs be excited to see you, even if you're gone for 2 minutes. And will always want to be very close to you. Very close. :)"

I don't do too much with her, she gets long walks on the weekend and we sometimes meet some dog friends, she loves to play with them. I don't run/hike/bike with her but she runs off the leash regularly, mostly on the evening walks. We never crate trained her and I don't think it's necessary, she never destroyed anything but that's a different topic and totally up to you. If the cat is already there, it won't be a problem. I also have a little brother (he's turning 5 this year) and she's great with him, even if he literally always wants to play with her or cuddle her when I visit my family. So I'm pretty sure your plans of doing exercises are more than enough for a V."
vizsla,37q3pu,korny611,1 point,Fri May 29 17:46:59 2015 UTC,"So, as long as you can provide a solid hour a day of some kind of running you should be okay. More walks should be taken, too. But running is very important.   My pup (1year. Had since 8 weeks) gets about an hour of off leash running/sniffing around in the woods. I walk and she goes at her own pace, running like crazy sometimes and stopping to sniff for a while in some bushes and sometimes walking next to me. This is usually an early morning thing. Afterwards she's happy to lounge around all day in the house. Our yard is small so not much goes on there. We take her on more walks around the neighborhood (about 2 or 3). We do this every day (for the most part. Sometimes we have to skip a day but she stil gets her walks).   Our neighbor sometimes watches the pup and they have a cat. Summer loves the cat and they play all day. Summer also loves people (kids too). However she is very strong and jumpy so we have to watch her around others. She can knock down an adult and just about flattens kids. All in play, though."
vizsla,37q3pu,Yetiius,1 point,Fri May 29 16:29:22 2015 UTC,"I am a Vizsla owner in a dog park. Our apartment is sub 1000 dq ft and ours has no problem with it. We were crating her when she was younger, but she has access to most of the house during the day now. She doesn't destroy anything unless it is paper and you are trying to chase her.   In terms of activity, we do about three short to medium walks per day. Morning, lunch, and evenings. Also, after work we either do a long walk or 30 min to an hour at the dog park. I would run with her, but she is too fast for me so the dog park is great for getting her energy out. She usually spends the entire time chasing down a ball. Weekends are hikes and swims or more dog park. It sounds like if you plan to run with them, you are active enough.   If you have a treadmill when they are older, that is awesome. These are definitely dogs that need to work and be active.   In regards to babies and other animals I don't have as much experience. I think with children it is more in teaching them how to properly interact with dogs. Ours can be shy around people for the first time on the leash but will sit and be around others fine. She's pointed at a few cats before but lived harmoniously with a smaller dog for a year just fine."

Easily trainable dogs, my rescue V when I first got him jumped some when I came home but within a couple of weeks I had him trained not to.  Talk to your vet as your puppy grows for the amount or lengths of runs while he is developing but after that there should not be a problem with running with them.  As for crating I built a couple of crates for the bedroom but soon experimented with leaving them out of the crates but still in the room a little at a time and the only things they ever bothered was a couple of pairs of shoes that my father had given me (I guess the figured since they didn't smell like me they were fair game plus mine loved chewing on leather).  Most times when I came home they were either asleep in the crates with the doors open or sacked out on the bed. They love lots of love and if you treat them right they will treat you right.  I miss mine on a daily basis but due to personal reasons at the time I can't justify having another until I get a few things sorted out.  One last thing get the book Versatile Vizsla it will tell you everything you want to know about them and a bunch you probably don't need to know."
vizsla,37q3pu,Grimk,1 point,Fri May 29 20:03:09 2015 UTC,"Well, a Viz loves the hanging out! The exercise schedule sounds a light, honestly (our 12-1/2 yr old boy does 3 mi offleash walk every day and a 9-to-15 mile bike ride most weeks, and has a big yard when he wants it) ... but I suspect a Viz would adapt to it if you're home in that apartment during the day. They're highly people-social and (AFAICT) being alone is worse for them than being idle.  Partly it will matter what breedline you get - they seem to vary widely in temperament between they ""hunting"" Vizsla and the ""show"" Vizsla lines, so check with your local Vizsla Club of America branch, talk to some folks.  As for cats and kids - very dog/training specific, but their energetic play style might be a problem if they get into chasing-games and get alittle ""dominance"" going (I suspect, based on anecdotes, that's more an issue if you get an intact male). My guy and I wrestle a lot, and sometimes I need to calm him down ... over the years I've picked up a tooth nick or a claw scrape a few times if I zigged when he thought I was gonna zag!  HTH"

vizsla,35q5g1,Toonsis1,9,Tue May 12 16:27:37 2015 UTC,"I would get her to the vet asap. We had a rescue mutt that ate rat poison years ago.  He displayed some of those same symptoms (panting, very thirsty,  warm to touch etc.). We ran a cycle a Vit K through him and it fixed him right up.    If it is indeed poisoning, you'll want to get her started on the K right away.     Hope it all works out and she is back to her normal self soon."
vizsla,35q5g1,haulingboat,3,Tue May 12 17:01:58 2015 UTC,thank you!!  She's got an appt in a few hours and I think I'm going to ask them to give her a round of Vit K just in case.
vizsla,35q5g1,a9u1tar1st,4,Tue May 12 17:13:50 2015 UTC,Any update OP? Hope your pup is okay.
vizsla,35q5g1,peypey95,2,Wed May 13 03:34:06 2015 UTC,"Hi guys - thanks for caring about her :)     For the first 30 minutes of the appointment, the vet talked with me about severe anxiety and phobias.  I mentioned that every once in a while she'll get upset with me (puts her nose on me or snaps her mouth close to my hand to say STOP) when I pet her hind (even gently) but never exhibits any signs of discomfort.  The vet decided to test her hip flexibility, and wow - she yelped and whipped around and tried to bite her.    The conversation immediately went from ""she's nutso"" to ""she's in pain"" and I, of course, lost it.  I understand that things can happen and phobias can develop (and I do think that there is something weird in our rental property that's contributing to this), but it is NOT the main cause of her strange behavior.  They ordered a blood panel and a urinalysis (impressed by the vet tech on his impeccable pee catch haha), and she'll be spending the day at the vets Friday for X-rays.  She was tested for dysplasia as a pup (negative), so I'm really hoping  it's arthritis or something we can easily treat for her sake.    We had a bad night last night, she wouldn't stop pawing me, so I tried everything I could think of to soothe her, put her in the bed with me (she immediately jumped out and went back to pawing), I laid with her in her bed and pet her until she fell asleep.  I snuck away but then would her click click paw paw 10 minutes later.  This went on for three hours until 1am, and I had reached my breaking point and put both dogs in the living room.  My mom had stayed with us last night, so Buddha started pawing her, got on the bed and dug for 30 minutes straight (my mom couldn't stop it), and then was panting.  She took a cool cloth to her, and that seemed to help soothe her.  That cycle happened a few more times until the poor girl wore herself out and passed out on the couch.  Moms are awesome.  Buddha greeted me in bed happily this morning, immediately got under the covers, plopped down next to my chest and fell fast asleep as if to say ""I'm sorry mom, I don't mean to do what I'm doing, I'm just hurting.""  It's a cooler day for us here (mid 60's) so I asked the dog walker to cool her down after their walk today.  I'll receive the blood work results tonight - but I'm leaning towards something inflammatory because she just seems SO HOT!  I called the vet and told them everything that happened last night, I figured the more info the better.    So maybe it's just a combination of anxiety, weather, our shitty mouse-ridden apt (moving as soon as we can into our own house), and something going on internally.  If everything comes back normal-ish, I'm going to have her stay with my mom for a few days so she can be in a place where she feels comfortable and there are no scary smells or noises and see what happens.  In the meantime, I'm just at work feeling like I could shrivel up and die.  I know she's ""just a dog,"" but she's my dog, and she's clearly in pain.  This dog saved my life, and I just want her to know I'm trying to help her."
vizsla,35q5g1,qxrs,2,Wed May 13 13:44:47 2015 UTC,"My old V had anxiety attacks every thunderstorm which consisted of a lot of panting, being hot, and trying to hide in the bathtub. She wouldn't paw at things though but maybe something is causing her some anxiety and that's why she is panting so much?"

vizsla,35q5g1,DJEbonics,2,Fri May 15 10:53:55 2015 UTC,"She had a few good days this week.  At the vets now for hip x-rays.  Vet thinking it's either severe anxiety/phobias, hip pain, or... a brain tumor.   I was thinking about her triggers (separation anxiety) and am really hoping that the fact I spent most of the day sunday cleaning out my closet was what sent her into orbit (omg mom is packing up and going to leave me) coupled with the fact that our house has smelled like dead mice for a month (it's driving me insane too and I'm not a hunting dog!) on top of the horrible winter we went through.    I have plans to give her extra cuddles, be very calm around her while in the house, and take time to bring her on extra one on one walks so she still feels like the special queen of the house and that mom and dad love her very much.  Crossing fingers for good x ray results today!!!!"

vizsla,350axz,BajaHaha,1 point,Wed May 6 23:24:10 2015 UTC,I just can't believe he got so big so fast!  He was 9 lbs when we picked him up at 8 weeks and he weighed in at 19 lbs yesterday. So basically at least 2 lbs a week!  Just make sure you take tons of pictures! We are loving him so much and having a great time watching him grow :)
