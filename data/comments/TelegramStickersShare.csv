I'd love to see this sticker pack get some hi-res love. :P I read that you can't manage to find any better, but I think that i can help you, mate.  Take a look to this Wikimedia page: a good guy uploaded every single emoji that he extracted from the ""Noto Color Emoji"", the font developed by Google (for the Noto Project). As you can see, they're all .SVG files: you won't have any resolution issue during scaling.  I'd do this by myself, but... hey you did it before me, so all I can do is help you to improve the pack!  I'm looking forward for seeing hi-res stickers!  Cheers :)"
TelegramStickersShare,3cnktv,krakovski,2,Mon Jul 13 17:59:13 2015 UTC,"Here we go, I added the HQ stickers. Hope you are going to enjoy them. By the way the .svg format tip was quite irrelevant. I took the images from the same site you gave me, the only difference is that I took that image (128px X 128px) that apparently was not scalable while I should have taken the (500px X 500px) one in the PNG format take a look.  Anyway thanks, I obviously more enjoy the HQ ones, without your suggestion I wouldn't have noticed what I just explained!"
TelegramStickersShare,3cnktv,krakovski,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:32:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the update! :P  Actually, I suggested the SVGs because I thought that you'd have resized the emojis to 512x512 using Photoshop or similar. :D  You can resize a single emoji doing a little hack with its URL too.  Let me explain: Telegram's pixel-perfect stickers need to be 512x512 px. When you upload a file 500x500, the bot will resize it and this could lead to a (minor) quality loss.  How can you avoid this in an easy way?  Example: you want to get the 512px version of this emoji , so click on the 500px link . Now take a look to the URL:  ... /Emoji_u0030_20e3.svg/500px-Emoji_u0030_20e3.svg.png   If you replace ""500px"" with ""512px"", the SVG engine used by Wikimedia will render for you a perfect 512x512 .png file that you can send to the bot for the ultimatesuperultra perfection! :D  Sorry for the wall of text! I thank you again for the quick update. :P Cya! ^  PS: I hope that during the time you'll add some other stickers like: thumb up / down, the punch, the folded-arms dude, the ""sorry"" guy, etc... :D  Have a nice day, mate! :)"
TelegramStickersShare,3cnktv,krakovski,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:28:05 2015 UTC,"I'm alredy adding the other stickers, but maybe in other stickerpacks so that people don't get annoyed by the huge number of stickers in only one stickerpack. No need to apology for the explanation, I totally didn't know that fact and I like to learn that kind of thing.  Maybe It'll be useful in the future. Anyway, I think that it's faster to do that with my Mac Anteprima, I select all the images and convert them in 512px X 512px in one click, it's a bit annoying to look for 500px in the imageURL...just saying (I know the bot doesn't accept lower sizes, it's not my first stickerpack)"

I guess I could have more optimally cropped the images myself, but it would be very time-consuming, so I decided against it (I'm no professional and have no optimised workflow, or anything like that). So all I really did was double the sticker sizes. I hope that's good enough for you, though. :)"

After that you need to send the actual sticker. The image file should be in PNG format with a transparent layer and must fit into a 512x512 square (one of the sides must be 512px and the other 512px or less).
