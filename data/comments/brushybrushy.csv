brushybrushy,3bjpet,Sir_Meowsalot,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:03:32 2015 UTC,Is this a good way to get rid of flees???? Seems way more efficient than a flee brush!!!
brushybrushy,3bjpet,ackza,2,Wed Jul 8 08:39:08 2015 UTC,"The best way to get rid of fleas is to use flea and tick medication such as Frontline or Advantix. If the infestation is really bad, there are pills called Capstar that work almost instantly and will kill anything and everything that bites your pet but it is not meant to be a long term solution. Vacuuming like that wouldn't guarantee that you get all of the eggs."
brushybrushy,3bjpet,Futurames,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:43:28 2015 UTC,"That sounds very pragmatic and logical, thank you for the useful info, so can I ask, how does Capstar kill everything? is it more of a hardcore poison that shouldnt be used on your pet very long because its just so toxic?  And why cant vacuuming get eggs as welll?"
brushybrushy,3bjpet,ackza,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:45:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure exactly which chemical does the trick, but yes, Capstar is basically a poison that kills the fleas and ticks. It's amazing for infestations. I had to use it myself once. I gave it to my dog and within a half hour I was finding dead fleas in the area around where she was laying.   It's meant to just give you a fresh start though; to kill everything so that you can then start preventative measures. I've heard of some people wanting to use it all the time because it works so well but it may not be healthy for your pet in the long run, especially if your dog or cat is a senior. It's also not cost effective. A good preventative solution will run you about $20 a month depending on where you get it from. Capstar costs about $35 for a pack of 6 and each capsule is only going to be effective for about 2 days.   I feel like I'm rambling but I've been through the nightmare of getting rid of fleas and as a groomer I've had to talk several clients through it.   One last tip, and this one sounds a bit strange. If you have a yard, there's a good chance that fleas are living there. I read about using ladybugs on a website discussing all natural flea and tick treatments. As cute as they are, lady bugs are beasts and one of them will eat upwards of 60 fleas a day. You can actually buy them on Amazon for extremely cheap, like $5 for 2000 and you can just release them and let them take care of business. You still need to treat your pet obviously but fewer fleas means less of a chance of future infestations."
brushybrushy,3b59n5,lydiadovecry,16,Fri Jun 26 02:09:46 2015 UTC,"Oh! My cat does the same thing.  Try this: Start at the very back/top of his head (Where the little bump on his noggin meets his kitty spine), and lightly scratch (Almost tickle) as you move your way to the front of his scalp, and then down the ridge of his nose. Very lightly itch/tickle.  My cat gets kind of impatient and sticks his nose up/out to make me pet harder,which is when I finally get his nose good and then really quickly/firmly scratch my way back down to the back side of his neck and then quickly around to his cheeks.  It's just a sensory overload. He falls over and slips into a kitty coma instantly, and just lies there. I can walk away and he's just plastered to that spot not moving at all. It's awesome.  PS when your cat goes into brushy shock, if you have hard wood floors it's a great opportunity to glide him around on the ground like a hockey puck"

brushybrushy,3adb04,rohmaru,2,Fri Jun 19 10:33:46 2015 UTC,"Slow loris:       Slow lorises are a group of several species of nocturnal strepsirrhine primates which make up the genus Nycticebus. Found in Southeast Asia and bordering areas, they range from Bangladesh and Northeast India in the west to the Sulu Archipelago in the Philippines in the east, and from Yunnan province in China in the north to the island of Java in the south. Although many previous classifications recognized as few as a single all-inclusive species, there are now at least eight that are considered valid: the Sunda slow loris (N. coucang), Bengal slow loris (N. bengalensis), pygmy slow loris (N. pygmaeus), Javan slow loris (N. javanicus), Bornean slow loris (N. menagensis), N. bancanus, N. borneanus, and N. kayan. The group's closest relatives are the slender lorises of southern India and Sri Lanka. Their next closest relatives are the African lorisids, the pottos, false pottos, and angwantibos. They are less closely related to the remaining lorisoids (the various types of galago), and more distantly to the lemurs of Madagascar. Their evolutionary history is uncertain since their fossil record is patchy and molecular clock studies have given inconsistent results.

brushybrushy,37gbu2,Ktaily,2,Thu Jun 4 03:39:10 2015 UTC,"Zebra shark:        This species is sometimes called the leopard shark, a name otherwise used for Triakis semifasciata.   The zebra shark (Stegostoma fasciatum) is a species of carpet shark and the sole member of the family Stegostomatidae. It is found throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific, frequenting coral reefs and sandy flats to a depth of 62 m (210 ft). Adult zebra sharks are distinctive in appearance, with five longitudinal ridges on a cylindrical body, a low caudal fin comprising nearly half the total length, and a pattern of dark spots on a pale background. Young zebra sharks under 50–90 cm (20–35 in) long have a completely different pattern, consisting of light vertical stripes on a brown background, and lack the ridges. This species attains a length of 2.5 m (8.2 ft).  Zebra sharks are nocturnal and spend most of the day resting motionless on the sea floor. At night, they actively hunt for molluscs, crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes inside holes and crevices in the reef. Though solitary for most of the year, they form large seasonal aggregations. The zebra shark is oviparous: females produce several dozen large egg capsules, which they anchor to underwater structures via adhesive tendrils. Innocuous to humans and hardy in captivity, zebra sharks are popular subjects of ecotourism dives and public aquaria. The World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Vulnerable worldwide, as it is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range (except off Australia) for meat, fins, and liver oil. There is evidence that its numbers are dwindling.

She was a Baird's Tapir, the national animal of Belize.   April was born on 27 April 1983. That date is now National Tapir Day in Belize, and World Tapir Day globally. April first came to the zoo in 1983 when she was very ill from a screwworm infestation. Sharon Matola, the keeper at the zoo, nursed her back to health.  Every year, a birthday party is held to celebrate April's birthday. In 2008 the party was attended by Belize Minister of State, Elvin Penner.  In 2012, April was given four birthday cakes made out of horse chow, honey, cucumbers and flowers.  April died on 31 October 2013. She was 30 years old at the time of her death.
