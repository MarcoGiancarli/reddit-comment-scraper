playstation,3e35rc,DirtyFinance,6,Tue Jul 21 16:31:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry for u bro.  A quick suggestion; login to your main account on sony entertainment network..... BEFORE THIS STEP U NEED TO SAVE YOUR PW &  IDs aside on a piece of paper.........   Am i clear?   Then deactivate all the ps3 consoles attached to your account..   Here, for them game is over,  they wont be able ever to reactive again your account unless they get your pw again ( impossible).   So after this step, if u turn on ur ps3 and try to login psn,  u will see a massage to enter your id & pw..   My other advise : why u wanna keep 140$ on ur account,  my style always below 5$ unless i wanna buy, so i topup my credit then buy quickly.   Finally make ultra complex passwords (google this).   Take care"

playstation,3e35rc,Tuskor,8,Tue Jul 21 17:59:30 2015 UTC,"I just went through all of this 3 weeks ago with my ps4, and I'm still banned. They won't reactivate your console or de activate the hackers.  I'm banned because my bank told me about suspicious purchases, I didn't recognize them so I disputed the charges. Turns out somebody hacked my account, even though I did have a randomly generated password and I don't share.   Well now my account has a ""negative balance"" and I'm banned until I pay off the games they purchased, about $140. They also said they probably won't be able to return the games once I do, and one is a special edition of a game I already own digitally.  Sorry, I'm pissed too and Sony can be real dicks."
playstation,3e35rc,gho0strec0n,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:33:43 2015 UTC,"Ok,  this is where u need to speak to psn service customers, asking them to deactivate ur consoles, telling them the account was hacked bla bla bla"

playstation,3e35rc,mikethetechie,2,Tue Jul 21 19:57:49 2015 UTC,My account was hacked and I've never sent any consoles in for repair. The hacker bought lots of things with my saved payment information (my mistake) and I was in the same boat as you although Sony support wouldn't refund me any of the purchased content but they did help me reset the password. They also couldn't reset my device activations because the hacker had already reset them and that option can only be used every 6 months. Fortunately 6 months later I was able to reset it myself using this page: https://account.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/liquid/cam/devices/device-media-list.action?displayNavigation=false  I would have called my bank and had the charges reversed but I've been told that doing that will cause Sony to ban the account and I have a lot of digital games so didn't really want to lose all of that. Thanks Sony!  I'd recommend changing your PSN email address and also your password and not keeping any saved payment information on the account.
playstation,3e35rc,MishRae,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:06:26 2015 UTC,"Wow that is not even remotely acceptable to me.

playstation,3e35rc,gho0strec0n,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:22:43 2015 UTC,Fortunately the hacker only had access to my account for a short time. I called Sony's customer support and they helped me reset my password. I then changed my PSN email address and password and that kept the hacker out. I just couldn't reset my device activations for 6 months so all of my devices were treated as secondary devices until I could reset it. It still pissed me off but the hacker didn't have access to my account for 6 months. The whole situation was ridiculous though.

From your library you can select and download things to any compatible device (cross-buy, multiple system tag), so long as you are still eligible (PS Plus free games).  As for a system dying, there's likely an easy fix through PlayStation support.   Edit: The library can be downloaded from whenever. You can buy something and not download it for several years, then come back and it'll still be there for you."
playstation,3e38sm,PotatoSkinTheVillain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:46 2015 UTC,So the only difference between  the two is that cross-buy gives you the game which can have multiple game entries on the ps store (e.g. Spelunky) and multiple tags has one game entry (e.g. FEZ)?  Edit: added example links

Since the credentials that was banned was linked to the one that was banned..  Once the temporary account was signed in, I marked that as the primary and deleted the banned account. Then you sign in with the new username/account PSN gave you and mark it as primary.  It took about and hour before their servers ""validated"" the new account.  I just left the PS4 on and took the dogs for a walk.  I lost any trophies that were not (what I assume) cloud based saved.  Games like BF4 and Destiny were still there.  Games like COD, Killzone, Rezogun were deleted.  As far as friends, I had to re-add everyone.  Luckily, almost all of them are clan members one way or another.  This whole situation is totally unnecessary and need to be revamped.  It seems that PSN doesn't even review the complaints filed, they just drop the ban hammer and tell you oh-well.

playstation,3dtg23,FenderBand,2,Sun Jul 19 07:51:18 2015 UTC,"I had this exact problem for about two months and seems to happen for no reason at all at random. Part of it may be due to crappy DNS providers and some of it may be due to the hardware in the playstation. For my PS3 the solution was getting a replacement unit. I had gotten the PS3 bundled with Grand Thet Auto Five and getting a replacement console under warranty resolved the issue. My hypothesis is that there may be some crappy or worn out hardware in the PS's that have this issue, and it could be simply because of the console getting old or simply like mine where I assume they skipped thorough hardware diagnostics in the factory to try and ship the new consoles out with the highly anticipated game on time. For a while I tethered my phone into a wifi hotspot and after some time even this began to render useless. So once I got a new console things went back to normal. It seems as though since this problem is so random that for some people changing the DNS servers is enough to get it working while for some (like mine) it still remains screwed up. I made a ton of posts about this on Sony's support forums and also on the PS subreddit and nobody was helpful even though there are literally thousands of people suffering from this since the playstation 3 came out years ago. So once again the only thing that got it working for me was getting a replacement console. Good luck in trying to get it working again. Oh, and DO NOT try to reset your PS3 to factory settings because I tried that and it didnt do anything to help. It actually just screwed up my save files because it couldnt reconnect to PSN to download updates. Let me know if you get it fixed or if I can help with anything else."

playstation,3dqhba,brown_elvis,18,Sat Jul 18 13:40:11 2015 UTC,"I had issues with mine at first, but after some tinkering around with my router settings it works great. I only use mine for streaming my PS4 to my bedroom, but that now works flawlessly. I think remote play is highly contingent on the quality of your router. If you want the info on how I got my router to work better with it let me know, I can write up a quick little guide.  **********Edit: Here is my quick guide to how I made my connection better.***********  From what I've found with remote play it is largely dependent on the quality of your router. My NetGear was losing packets when it was transferring data during remote play creating a less than desirable quality or loss of connection completely. I did some research and found out how to setup port forwarding specifically for Playstations remote play. Here is how I did it.  1) I set my PS4 up to use a Static IP address by following the instructions listed here  2) I went into my router settings (under advanced in most router menus) and set TCP to forward Port 9295 to the static ip address I gave my PS4.   3) Also within my router settings I set UDP to forward ports 9296-9297  to the static ip address I gave my PS4.  By setting these ports to forward to the static IP address assigned to the PS4 it eliminated the router losing packets as it now did not have to make any decisions when transferring the remote play data.  Hope that helps."

Its a shame because it is actually a damn good piece of hardware. That said the PSTV is only good for remote play if your PS4 and PSTV are hardwired on the same network. I have no input lag whatsoever and the picture quality is amazing. Sony should honestly just drop vita support and focus on mobile gaming. They are so paranoid over pirated apps that it cripples the opportunity. If they had their heads out of their asses they could dominate with a few no brainers. Remote play for iOS & Android (not just their phones) throw in airplay, chromecast support and make a smaller DS4 to make a few bucks would be a solid start if you ask me. Also redo PSTV UI to mimic PS4s makes to much sense to pass up. I just wish Sony would stop being afraid of its own damn shadow sometimes."
playstation,3dqhba,Streetfoldsfive,-2,Sun Jul 19 01:24:00 2015 UTC,The thing is Sony is already dominating the console market and I think that's what makes them think they can get away with pushing crap on their consumers.

playstation,3dqhba,Manjoume,4,Sat Jul 18 17:09:09 2015 UTC,In my experience the ps TV streams fine on a wired network but not on wifi. Other than that it isn't their fault devs don't patch games to support ps TV. It's up to the dev to do that. They have a clear list of titles that are supported. I would say for a 50$ piece of hardware that plays a decent amount of vita games and streams my ps4 pretty well is cool.   Sucks your having such issues.
playstation,3dqhba,Manjoume,2,Sat Jul 18 14:38:55 2015 UTC,You do have to make sure to uncheck direct connection on your PS4 or your PS TV will ignore the wired connection and try to ad hoc with your PS4 by default. This is a big part of why so many people have trouble the first time they try.

playstation,3dqhba,MassGravity,2,Sat Jul 18 17:11:46 2015 UTC,"PS Now isn't for you then because you have said backlog. They're specifically not toting PS Now as backwards compatibility or something like that. The idea is for you to play games you don't own (you sold it or don't have the console anymore) on several platforms such as PS Vita, PS TV, PS3, PS4 and Bravia TVs. I think PC might be planned but for the most part you having old discs means you aren't a target for this service. If there's only a few you want to play, don't use the service and instead use the money to buy used games.   If your issue is that you have a backlog of PS3 games that you want to play but no console, buy a used console. If you had a list of games you wanted to play but don't want the mess of discs/cases then PS Now could be decent.  The price is still to high for me and I am not particularly interested in using the service at the moment."

The PS4 is great, I really like it - I tried the PSTV and was astounded at its pointlessness a few days later.   On Wi-Fi, its the slowest fucking thing ever. My Tablet with the hacked remote play app is considerably faster over Wifi than it.   Also - features. I don't own a Vita, so the game slot for it was useless. The media streaming only works with a PS3 and not a PS4.   The only good thing its done for me was I needed a spare HDMi cable last night, and remembered that had one with it."

playstation,3dqr8g,infinitelives,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:38:40 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense.

playstation,3dqs8x,BuckyDuran,2,Sat Jul 18 15:37:12 2015 UTC,"PS3 backwards compatibility is pretty much confirmed to never be a thing on PS4 both because of the strange architecture of the PS3 and because it would essentially kill Playstation Now, the streaming service Sony spent a lot of time, money, and effort on. Your best alternatives to backwards compatibility are either:   Using PS Now Looking for one of the increasing number of PS4 remasters for PS3 games that now includes (or will soon include) Borderlands, God of War 3, Uncharted, The Last of Us, GTA V, Resident Evil, Tomb Raider, Flower, and Journey, to name a few."

playstation,3dqs8x,mtlyoshi9,2,Sat Jul 18 17:38:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, supposedly all about how the systems run differently, but I'm not too familiar with the details. The streaming service works on PS3 games exactly because it's not actually running on your consoles.  The PS4 library's growing slowly but surely. PS3 was stronger at this point for sure, but there are some pretty good things on the horizon."
playstation,3dqs8x,mtlyoshi9,2,Sat Jul 18 17:42:24 2015 UTC,"It was supposedly about the architecture before, too, which is (again, supposedly) why backwards-compatibility was removed from the PS3 in the first place, but then the classics (PSOne and PS2) started rolling out on PSN, and you can play those on any model PS3, now, so that excuse seems a little played-out, coming from Sony."

Honestly, there were fewer than 10 games for the PS3 that I truly had much interest in, and the biggest reason I still have it anymore is because it plays Blu-Rays and had a good chunk of games from my late childhood available for me to explore again on PSN. They seem to have recently expanded the PSOne/PS2 game library on PSN, which I think is odd since those titles would just be limited to their older console, now.  There are exactly two games I'm even interested in for the PS4 in the foreseeable future, so without backwards compatibility, dropping a few hundred on a separate console seems...meh."

The only problem I had with it was that you seem to get too powerful after a while and the game loses a good bit of challenge, but the combat is still tons of fun and the Nemesis system is one of the most interesting mechanics in recent memory.  The Last of Us is one of the greatest games of all time, the story is absolutely incredible and the online multiplayer is a refreshing change of pace. GTAV and Tomb Raider are both great games too, even though they are also re-releases. If you haven't played Far Cry 3, Far Cry 4 is a good choice, it's basically a slightly upgraded version of the previous game. But if you're anything like me, playing another shooter will just leave you wanting to play Destiny. Infamous: Second Son is just downright fun, you get to fly through a realistic Seattle using one of four different super powers."

playstation,3dkqp4,J-Hawks,6,Fri Jul 17 01:41:56 2015 UTC,"For me, I'd choose buying physical games over downloading, for two reasons: 1.) It's just so much more satisfying to look at a shelf full of games than a download list. 2.) I have this fear that one day, PSN will shut down or devs take their games out, and I'll have no way of accessing my games. Kinda like how you can't re-download P.T. anymore.  Downside of that is that digital games go on sale a lot more often, so you'll probably spend more money if you go all physical. So far, the only digital games I own are PSN classics, which I play on my PS3."
playstation,3dkqp4,zerosaver,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:12:33 2015 UTC,So there's no big advantage over one or the other aside from possibly price?
playstation,3dkqp4,zerosaver,3,Fri Jul 17 04:21:07 2015 UTC,"More or less. Physical vs. Digital is more of a preference thing, imo. Especially with the PS4, since I've read that you ALWAYS have to install games into your HD regardless whether you got it physical or digital."
playstation,3dkqp4,zerosaver,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:43:40 2015 UTC,What exactly does that mean?
playstation,3dkqp4,Endyrith,3,Fri Jul 17 04:44:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the specifics since I don't own a PS4 yet, but basically you install the game into your HD for easier access and faster loading. Kind of like how you install PC games, but you need the disc in your disc drive for authentication.  How it Works Generally"
playstation,3dkqp4,RoyalAssassin82,4,Fri Jul 17 05:12:35 2015 UTC,"I would recommend The Last of Us: Remastered and Bloodborne. Bloodborne is tons of fun, but some people find it too difficult. Both games might be a bit graphic, probably not suitable for small children, but I'm going to assume that you're fine with adult games if you just purchased The Witcher 3 (which is another one of my favorite PS4 games.)  Be sure to pick up each month's free PS+ games; there are new PS+ games the first Tuesday of each month in the US (might be a different day in other regions). You can redownload the PS+ games as long as you have an active PS+ membership. I would recommend going onto the PlayStation Store website to get all the free games for the PS4, PS3, and Vita each month. This way, you will have a library of games to play if you ever pick up a PS3 or Vita, or those games could be put on the PS4 at some point in time, possibly getting you a free copy of that game for the PS4. I also feel obligated to mention that Rocket League, one of this month's PS+ games, is incredibly fun and is definitely worth playing (it has rocket cars playing soccer and is the sequel to a game called Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars.)  In regards to whether or not you should download games or buy physical copies, there are some advantages for each. Downloading the game will let you play a game without having to worry about putting in a disk, but you can't sell the game after you've purchased it, and the downloaded game takes up more space on the hard drive. I personally buy the physical copies of each game when possible, because the hard drive can fill up really fast, especially with all the free PS+ games. Of course, you can always delete games that you've downloaded and redownload them later (unless that game is PT unfortunately.)  I hope this helped, and you can feel free to add me. Most games are better with friends to play with, after all!"

playstation,3djz02,awesomeness243,3,Thu Jul 16 21:51:22 2015 UTC,"iirc the ps4 takes in air from its side slots (mostly the one on the right side) and pushes the hot air out through the back of the device, pretty much in the area where the power connector is located.  That's not just power supply heat, the console heatflow is designed to work like that.  If you feel like your ps4 is hotter than it should be, clean the slots on the side of the console, and make sure it has room to push out the heat behind the console, and room to find cool air on the sides"

playstation,3dlet7,naylord,5,Fri Jul 17 08:23:58 2015 UTC,I'm really sorry about that; also rocket league is kind of useless without plus since you need it to play online. I legitimately believed that it would have a single sale on ps4 this month: not even one. I guess you proved me wrong.  Lesson is to do a quick search on everything you buy in the future. The game is great and all but a cursory search would have told you it was a free ps+ game. Can't hurt to be an informed consumer. In this case knowing it is free in other cases steering you away from broken buggy games.

As far as PS+ is concerned, $50 a year is only a little over $4 a month, which is far from a bad deal. Contact Sony as others have said and see where that gets you."

playstation,3dlhxq,Voyager5555,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:14:00 2015 UTC,"Hey there!  So first of all, Diablo 3 online gets a bit annoying imo. As far as I can tell, there are certain items that players have modded into having 3 sockets and they equip their characters with several of these items (rings, amulets etc) and then put crazy high level gems in them. They basically create super powerful attacking characters who just blow through levels on Torment 6 and destroy everything in one hit. The exp gain is huge, which is why you get to paragon 500 or so in a matter of a few games. It's a bit ridiculous and does take away from the fun, but I don't know how to stop it, apart from leaving the games as soon as you see one of these people in the squad.  As to the main question: PS+ is worth it for me. I play Battlefield 4 and Driveclub online and chat with a mate while playing with him online. I didn't really think of the other perks when I got PS+, but having had it for two months, I can say the outlay is pretty much worth it. I've downloaded 2 free games (Rocket League and MGS), both worth 20€ on the store and intend on downloading more when the games come out, which will easily outstrip the 50€ yearly membership cost.  I don't know about Bloodborne or Witcher, as I've never played them, but I can say that I played on GTA V online on my PS3 a lot after I'd completed the game, and would definitely do so again, were I to buy it for the PS4. A lot of the games nowadays are geared more towards online play, almost making a membership necessary to get the full enjoyment from the game. I was also a little annoyed about having to pay to play online, but that's the way it is now.   If you're worried about the cost for a yearly PS+ membership, try out a 1 or 3 month membership. 1 month costs 5€ (I think) and 3 is 15€, or something similar. Try it and see.  I hope this helped you a bit!"

It MORE than makes up its cost in free games alone. Plus, even if your sub lapses, as soon as you renew, all the games you claimed are available to you again!"

playstation,3ddy1p,Entstinct,7,Wed Jul 15 16:48:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly, not really surprising at all, it was launched 9 years ago, 12 years after the initial PS1 launch, the mission would have been planned for a few years before 2006 which closes the gap some more, and that gives them a few years after the PS1 launch to watch the processor perform, analyse it and decide it was suitable to go in to R&D for the launch.  If they were launching it now with the PS1 chip I would be more surprised, but this is an old mission."
playstation,3ddy1p,killit,5,Wed Jul 15 22:19:17 2015 UTC,"The R3000 CPU architecture is a lot older than the PS1, actually. First launched in 1988. Powered some of SGI's graphic workstations in the mid-90s IIRC.   So they'd have had a lot more data on it than just from the PS1 era."

playstation,3dgk3p,SpajX,5,Thu Jul 16 17:17:40 2015 UTC,I was wondering the same thing. But when you really think about it those pictures are pretty small and you'd need 100s if not thousands before they really became noticeable size wise.

playstation,3dgk3p,Leaningthemoon,5,Thu Jul 16 09:43:29 2015 UTC,"Trophies are required for PS4 games so no, you can't turn them off in the way you're describing.  I also don't care about them but just ignore it when they pop up, screen shotting is a bit annoying."

playstation,3dgk3p,Leaningthemoon,3,Thu Jul 16 20:23:55 2015 UTC,"Then disabling the trophy pop-up notification is the next best thing for you, I guess. You'll still earn trophies in the background once in a while but you'll never know cause no-one told you and you don't care about them anyway ;)  You won't be able to disable that feature altogether though as it's become an integral part of ""The PlayStation experience"" ever since its introduction back on the PS3.  Regarding the possibility of trophy screenshots cluterring up your hard drive: One such screenshot is around 400kb. You would need more than A MILLION(!) screenshots to even get close to filling the 500GB a launch PS4 has built in.  So you really don't need to worry about that."
playstation,3dgk3p,cenorexia,-3,Thu Jul 16 09:53:27 2015 UTC,I guess nobody gets my point.   I don't want my system needlessly filling up space (even a little bit at a time) with stuff I don't want.   I already swapped for a 2TB and I've got 860GB used so even the small things add-up

playstation,3dbodi,catfayce,10,Wed Jul 15 00:48:49 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed the game a lot.   A lot of people hated the finishing system but i loved it. Im really bad at falling in smash ao i enjoyed that the game didn't have too much of that.  I liked the charactera and their specials were great. Killzone was a cool guy to use. I actually was too good with him.  I think their should be more characters but overall i really was in the minority and liked playing it.  Im sad most people didn't enjoy it.
playstation,3dbodi,Odaismygod,16,Wed Jul 15 02:36:17 2015 UTC,"The one thing I want, is ring outs. If you're going to copy Smash Bros, copy it 100%! It's already viewed as a copy, so changing things for the worse is not worth it! I hate that you need to kill with supers, it should be about knocking them off of the stage.   And for the love of god, the arcade mode needs to be stock!"
playstation,3dbodi,Marcopolio5,4,Wed Jul 15 02:33:28 2015 UTC,It made every round feel like a chore which put me off entirely. If it was straight beat em up like smash then yes I'd consider a rebuy with more characters of course!
playstation,3dbodi,Hawkings_WheelChair,4,Wed Jul 15 06:12:46 2015 UTC,"I would scrap the whole Supers = Kills = Wins. I would have it so that supers do count as kills but also knocking characters off the stage also count as kills. One issue me and my friends had is that the games would get so long because since we were equal skill level we would always dodge each other's supers. I would add a lot more variety on the maps. It always bugged me that the Littlebigplanet stage only had Buzz ask one question per match. It would be a lot more fun and interactive if he would of done it consistently through the match. As for characters we have a lot more we can choose from. Some I would like to see are; Delsin Rowe, Joel/Ellie, Cloud Strife, Big Boss, Sir Galahad, Crash, Spyro, and maybe even Elena from Uncharted. And for the love of god make that arcade mode shorter or SOMETHING. TL:DR More characters, Funner levels, Shorter arcade modes."
playstation,3dbodi,Apgallardo__,5,Wed Jul 15 05:40:22 2015 UTC,"Did you play the last game?   Yes, I did. My friends and I liked it a lot.   What were the high points and low points?   I wanna say the high points were how unique some of the characters were. Also, the combat system. At first, none of us were fans about the only being killed by specials but as we played more it grew on us. It made the game far more competitive. Everyone scrambling to get their #3 and trying to dodge the others. Loads of fun. We all also really liked how the backgrounds were mashes between games. Another thing I really liked the fact that there were no ring outs. It's so fucking annoying on Smash, especially because some characters just seem to be built to never get back up to the platform which is fukcing stupid.   The low points were the arcade mode. Nothing special, nothing new. A lot of the time it felt like some specials were OP as fuck (Sweet Tooth, Zeus). Specials should be difficult to dodge, not impossible. They needed more characters and at the time I don't think they had a lot of options.    what characters would you add?   Sora (Kingdom Hearts), Laura Croft (Tomb Raider), Vault Hunter with the ability to switch between classes (Borderlands), Lightning or Cloud (Final Fantasy), Subzero, Scorpion, Raiden or Liu Kang (Mortal Kombat), Spyro (Spyro the Dragon). There are a buttload more I want in there but I can't think of them now.    what map from any PS game would you like as a stage?   To be honest, I don't give a shit about stages.    any other comments?   The game has so much potential to be it's own unique game. Enough that it doesn't get compared to Smash anymore. They just need to take the right steps in the right direction."

playstation,3dbodi,metroidfan220,2,Wed Jul 15 00:58:14 2015 UTC,"Played the game all summer long last summer. Loved it.  I had a lot of fun leveling my characters and 100%ing this game. At first I thought it would be a grind, but next thing I knew I was almost there. As far as low points, you've already mentioned the menus. shudder  I know he was in Smash Bros, but not having Solid Snake just felt wrong. Also with the new Final Fantasy 7 redo coming out, maybe some representation there wouldn't be bad.  Can't think of any maps, and my only other comment is that I'm disappointed that this game still isn't compatible with the PlayStation TV. I got the Vita version cross buy with the ps3 version and I haven't been able to play it because it still isn't compatible with the PS TV. Sony seems to not really care about this title any more."
playstation,3dbodi,Adambomb2000,2,Wed Jul 15 04:27:59 2015 UTC,"I played the game and really liked it.  I think a sequel could be excellent.  I think more third party characters is a must, however. Cloud Strife, Crash Bandicoot, and Solid Snake were big misses."
playstation,3dbodi,hosche,2,Wed Jul 15 04:35:59 2015 UTC,"While mashing two stages into one was a neat idea, I'd much rather them all be separate. Or make it optional to either play them on their own or combined the way it is now."
playstation,3dbodi,ParadoxWarrior,2,Wed Jul 15 08:08:38 2015 UTC,"1) I have it on Vita. I felt it fit better than on the PS3. 2) Highs were characters and stages, as well as certain aspects of gameplay, such as Supers and throws. Lows were the gameplay (controls, combos) and multiplayer. 3) Characters from recent & classic PS games, so Sora from Kingdom Hearts, Joel from The Last of Us, Crash Bandicoot, etc... 4) Obviously stages from new character, so maybe the End of the World from Kingdom Hearts with some Knack elements in the stage. (That's just an example) 5) All I would say is that if they can fix multiplayer and controls while making an excellent game, then they've got me (including a release for Vita). I throughly enjoyed the game, even with issues.   All in all, I don't know if a sequel is viable unless Sony Santa Monica plans on making it since SuperBot folded. (SSM was responsible for the game updates and costumes after SuperBot fell)"
playstation,3dbodi,Son_of_Atreus,2,Wed Jul 15 11:32:28 2015 UTC,"I played it, platniumed it. It was fun, but it has it problems. The characters were mostly cool, although a few were just gimicky and obscure. The single player ""campaign"" was pretty poor, the final boss was especially crap. I liked the build up power system, although Smash fans had a problem, not sure why they did have both modes, one being the All Stars build up and super skill attack, and also the % build and then ringout. I know that may be seen as a copy of Smash, but the whole game is a copy of Smash anyway.  I would like a sequel, but I think it should be a ps+ game at launch in order to help build a player base, or at least have a ps+ scaled down edition.   The menus, game options, and modes really need to fleshed out if there is a sequel. Still pictures of characters, too few maps, weird characters with stupid moves, limited games modes including a poor single player experience all made this game feel unfinished, like a draft.   With all these problems said, I enjoys many of the aspects of the game. It was great to have a fun 4 player fighter that doesn't require the hardcore skill of SF or to know massive move lists like MK. I loved the combined stages, just wish there was more of them with more variety in the layouts."

And that's just for the low-end simple games - never mind the highly optimised titles.  Think of it like monoglots in cross-language conversation.  360 vs One is like a Spaniard trying to read and understand Italian - tricky, but due to root similarities there is going to be some understanding as well as misunderstandings.  Now imagine a native, monolingual, English speaker (PS4) trying to read Traditional Chinese (PS3).  Not so easy, pretty much impossible.    Even in the early days of the PS3 Dev's were griping about how hard it was to code for.  As for the PS1/2?  Well, I guess they just want to re-sell the games to you and promote people buying new games rather than using it as a one-stop retro shop for old machines.  But we can use PS2's for that, so it's not so bad.    For the record, MS didn't suddenly 'discover the technology' to make BC happen, they were working long and hard on it in secret.  These kinds of developments don't happen overnight. They made no announcements prior to E3 about trying to do it so as not to get hopes up and be accused of lying if they couldn't do it or couldn't get it to run well.  That they managed it is a miracle - and that is with the 360 and One having FAR more similar architecture than the PS3 and PS4."

Especially fast-paced First Person Shooters lack from this.  Add to this that only a handful of games on the PS3 officially supported remote play. I know that you can ""force"" other games to support Remote Play using a custom firmware, but none of these games will be adjusted for Remote Play, like most PS4 games that come with their own, customized button layout when remote played on a Vita.  And if nothing else is implemented by the developer, the default mappings of L2 and R2 on the Vita are the bottom left and bottom right area of the front touch screen.

playstation,3cv126,Bounkass,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:08:46 2015 UTC,I don't follow your question.
playstation,3cv126,alucardbc,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:33:47 2015 UTC,You should have a router with multiple ethernet ports. Your PS4 goes into one and your other connections go into the others. If you are out of ports you will need to by a switch that you connect to one of the ports and it will extend the number of ports your network has. The PS4 should not be the box serving your internet to your house.
playstation,3cv126,Bounkass,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:02:17 2015 UTC,I understand that. But how do I play online with PSTV when the whether cable is occupied by the video?
playstation,3cv126,alucardbc,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"Where do you think there is a lack of ports? On the PSTV as well as most other devices that have Ethernet and HDMI, PS4 included, video and network are two separate ports on the PSTV. So you need two separate cables. HDMI goes to your TV, Ethernet goes to your router or switch. Unless you do wireless networking, in which case HDMI is still only doing video and no networking."
playstation,3cv126,Bounkass,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:32:18 2015 UTC,"I think we're misunderstanding each other. I mean how can the video go from the PS4, through the PSTV to the other TV when there's no HDMI cable connecting the trio, while the ethernet cable is occupied because playing online? Does the ethernet cable from the PS4 to my router work both ways?"
playstation,3cv126,bringyoutomyhell,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:25:08 2015 UTC,"Oh I see what your asking. Sorry about that.  Ethernet can do multiple things at once. It'll stream and have you online at the same time. The PS4 streams the video from the game over your network to the PSTV. An example setup would be the PS4 is in your Living Room plugged into your main TV. Then your PSTV is plugged into the TV in your Bedroom. When streaming from the PS4 to the PSTV, which you use a built in app on the PSTV called Remote Play, your PS4 takes the video and sound it displays to the TV it is plugged into and streams it over your network to your PSTV using your home network. Your PSTV which will have a Dualshock 3 (DS3) or Dualshock 4 (DS4) controller linked to it, will show the video and sound on your TV in your bedroom while at the same time taking your controller input and streaming the commands back to the PS4. All of this while you are still on the PSN.  Inventory count: 2 TV's (one for each device), 1 PS4, 1 PSTV, 2 HDMI cables (one for each device), 2 ethernet cables (one for each device)  Something to keep in mind is that this does not mean you can have two people playing two different games at the same time on the same PS4. The PS4 will only play one game but will show the same screen on both the TV it is plugged into, but also the PSTV.  Hopefully that answers your question."

Not exclusive to PS4, but exclusive to next gen, The Witcher 3 is an amazing game.   Also Next gen exclusive, Arkham Knight is very good.   Coming up for PS4 we have Uncharted 4, The Last Guardian, No Man's Sky, Ratchet and Clank, and more.

playstation,3ctbm1,Hyaze,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:42:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't feel like it's as hard as everyone says it is. Don't get me wrong, it's challenging for sure. But it's only impossible if you're an idiot. (See: How you don't play Bloodborne). It's mostly trial and error, assessing the situation, knowing your limitations. It's incredibly satisfying when you complete an area because you feel like you actually did something. It isn't a mindless slog through monsters."

Yeah their hardware is great, but their customer service is absolute trash and their network is too.   I've grown up with Sony my entire life and will go on a Playstation circle jerk all day, but the only reason that Sony won the start of this generation of console gaming was because they got the last word out over Microsoft on everything. They openly mocked Microsoft over their bold but bad ideas and won the circle jerk crowd over right in the beginning. That initial blast of followers won't be enough to win out for the whole generation. Microsoft will slowly take over and dominate with the Xbone if Sony doesn't up their game within the next couple years.   If Sony wants to remain relevant in the future, they seriously need to take a look at their software and improve it. The party system is great and the capture/streaming system is excellent, but they are missing a lot of essentials.   EDIT: some poorly auto-corrected words"
playstation,3cpprp,SpyroThBandicoot,0,Fri Jul 10 02:19:48 2015 UTC,so true... they gotta step up there game. make PSN a even more social experience

It's so hard to find anything I downloaded more than a month ago. PS3 wasn't that great but at least it let us organize our games.    They took their shitty ribbon navigation and shitified it even more. We don't need more social options, we don't need to watch college football on our consoles while our friends react to our reactions. We just an interface that looks good and works."
playstation,3cpprp,SurgicalScope,3,Fri Jul 10 16:46:40 2015 UTC,"While I can definitely get behind this, some of the things offered PSN already does.   Deleting games from Library(seriously!? am I the only non-retarded person with a PS4, c'mon guys. It's been almost two years and people haven't figured this out) Start/stop - recording-double tap share button to start recording, hit it again and press square to save (asking for any more is just whiny entitlement/hand holding) Delete trophies - I thought they just did this in a recent update? this is something I don't personally care about. But I can see how the OCD people would appreciate this. Recent players - they already have this, but it is shite. Only seems to work if i am playing with that person right then. Auto shut down after download - you mean like the PS3? i can't imagine they removed this feature, but it's solved in part by power saving and the suspend mode.   But yes on the whole these changes are good and I support them."
playstation,3cpprp,celticfan008,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:16:05 2015 UTC,"So some of your complaints are missing the point   Deleting games from library   You seem to think this means deleting them from the hard drive, no, it means removing them from your library. Completely. No icon cluttering your library. This is useful for betas and demos and such, things that you likely will never feel the need to download again, let alone the need for a shortcut to do so.   Delete Trophies   Yeah, they added the ability to delete 0% games, but what about those games that give you 3 trophies after 5 minutes of play? People want to be able to delete those games that they'll never play again, but have earned trophies in that may as well be (or in same cases literally are) earned by hitting ""new game""."

On xbox 360 when a game is free for the month it is your game after it is downloaded not a rental and you own it for life regardless of your subscription at any time.

playstation,3cw6xs,RynB93,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:15:48 2015 UTC,"Ps Plus can still be a great value if you own multiple Playstation systems and at least Sony isn't requiring you to have it for online play like on 360. I have both plus and gold and tbh, I think plus tends to be a better value because they tend to offer higher quality games, although gold has been improving. Also, the rental aspect(only owning the games while you're a menber) is how things work on Xbox one, just an FYI if you have/plan on getting one.   That being said, I think they're both great services that are well worth the price. Xbox may become my favorite of the two as they introduce the new backward compatibility feature to more games(and hopefully they'll be free games)."
playstation,3cw6xs,RynB93,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:45:26 2015 UTC,"yeah but you have to pay for xbox one and ps4 to play online so the service that you are getting is just a bonus, paying for ps plus on the ps3 is just a waste of money IMO. I have heard PS Plus being compared to gamefly and the person said it was even better. But with game fly you are paying 22 dollars a month to play ANY 2 games you want not just the 3 that sony selects for you with ps plus. Game fly is still the better option here imo and it seems that FIFA street is only available to ps plus members as I haven't seen it on any ""deals"" page."

Thing is, if you connect two (or more) systems to the same network (easiest would be through a router), you can play LAN co-op games in Borderlands (or Unreal Tournament or pretty much any game that has a LAN option, I guess) without the need for an active internet connection.  Here's more info on that from Sony's side: https://support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/828/~/play-ps3-games-in-lan-mode"
playstation,3cp12q,cenorexia,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:04:13 2015 UTC,Is this the case with PS4 too? Using a switch doesn't seem that problematic.
playstation,3cp12q,cenorexia,2,Fri Jul 10 09:34:27 2015 UTC,"The problem is not so much if the system can technically do it - it needs to be supported by the game!  Only games that support LAN mode can be linked together via LAN.  On the PS4 games like Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and Ghosts come to mind (Here's a video of CoD:AW in LAN-Mode).  So it is very much possible, even on the PS4. But it has  to be supported by the game! Not every game, that can be played online can also be played in LAN.  Here you can see what PlayStation games support LAN multiplayer:   PlayStation 2 PlayStation 3 PlayStation 4   Have fun! :)"

playstation,3cp50r,MorJ90,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:23:15 2015 UTC,"PSN downloads are going to be all over the place in terms of speeds and how long they take. It has to do with several things: one,  is certainly going to be your ISP. Some say their speeds are greatly affected due to their ISP others aren't and can get a very fast speed no problem. Aside from at home that's been my experience, fast speeds. Others say Sony is throttling PSN speeds and others say it's the ISPs doing it. The truth is probably a combination. One of the Firmware updates supposedly they throttled PSN speeds. If that's true to control server traffic demand it makes sense. If your ISP is known for throttling that's going to take your speed on PSN down even further. So a lot of it depends on those two things.  One suggestion I've read that has worked for me on PS3 at least-I haven't seen much of a change trying this on my PS4 though-is get the update file download started. Once it starts pause the download. Then go into settings, then network, then you want the test Internet connection option. Let it run the test. Finally go back to your downloads, unpause it then see if it makes any difference in speed and time it'll take to finish. Some are saying that's helping a bit with PS4. Another suggestion is try downloading in rest mode-however I'd be careful with rest mode because although it's much better now when that feature was introduced it was making some PS4s freeze up while in rest mode making it so you couldn't reboot the system and you had to manually unplug then plug the system back in.  I hope this all helps somewhat, I didn't want to get terribly technical on ya but still wanted to try to help as best I could!"
playstation,3cp50r,Bh7812,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:08:35 2015 UTC,All you can do is pause the download process and start it again. It will reinitialize/relist your download and can be useful in order to get an acceptable download speed. I have 20Mb/s download speed said by PSN network test and with this method I can download 2-3MB/s. You should try repeatedly if it does not work first.
playstation,3cp50r,almightyNTER,2,Thu Jul 9 19:18:44 2015 UTC,Yeah this is another good suggestion that's extrejely simple for anyone to do. It's effective most of the time but again it'll depend on how cooperative your ISP and individual connection will be with PSN. If you're unsure on the two things I gave you to try OP try AlmightyNTER's suggestion.

I for one don't follow anything from that console.  Your investment in Playstation is pretty heavy at this point.  Are you really so ready to throw away that investment on the hope that the grass will be greener?  I appreciate your frustration. I had something slightly similar where I'd bought content, paid for £32.99 for it and couldn't get to it. It wasn't showing anywhere. Sony told me I needed to take it up with the manufacturer. I did they said they were desperately trying to sort it out with Sony. Sony support were telling a completely different story.  I would suggest call them and be persistent, but not belligerent and ask to speak to a supervisor if that is the answer you are given again.  Advise them you are recording the call and ask if they mind you using it for training purposes.  AGain, keep in mind your end goal is having it resolved, so always be patient explaining the situation. Chances are, despite what they've told you the dickhead you spoke to earlier didn't write much of any use down.  Tell them that you've posted your experience to the PlayStation Reddit and additionally is there a customer satisfaction survey that you could be sent as a part of the transaction.  Additionally make sure you get names, ask for spellings so there is no doubt.  This looks like it might help too.  I have no vested interest in whatever console you use, it just strikes me that you and your family have vested a lot of time, money and emotion into your Sony consoles and I think it would be a shame for you and yours to walk away from that because you've been fucked over by a third party*.   I do wonder how much the Sony hacks have led to so much of this, technically bringing their lack of security and the problem with it firmly back in their court"

I have heard from some that a wheel is preferred (then again, with all sim like racers a wheel is usually the best option), but I played a lot of Forza on the Xbox, so I am used to using a controller for my driving."
playstation,3ckp6j,Verlogh1,5,Wed Jul 8 19:43:52 2015 UTC,"Well the controller layout can be totally remapped however you like, so personally I think it's as good as you can get with a controller. I'm sure a good driving wheel is better, but if you don't like the gas on the trigger, you can change it to the stick, for example. Works great. Although if you're coming from xbox to ps3, you may be understandably annoyed by the ps3 triggers."
playstation,3ckp6j,NineduceXII,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:41:32 2015 UTC,"Cool. I'd probably try remapping the acceleration/breaking to the x button/ sq. button for a PS2 like experience. I prefer triggers, and I do like the Dualshock 3, but I think the triggers do leave a lot to be desired."

playstation,3clrn1,JelloOstriches,2,Wed Jul 8 22:09:51 2015 UTC,"If you're into hack-n-slash games, I'd recommend the God of War trilogy. The combat is really fun, the boss battles are some of the best in gaming, and it's Greek Mythology, which is always fun. It's definitely one of my favorites.  But if you want something a bit more light-hearted with similar mechanics, I'd highly recommend Heavenly Sword. The story is great, the combat is really fun (though the motion controls with the controller can feel pretty gimmicky at times) and it has one of my favorite video game antagonists, played by the same guy who voiced Gollum IIRC. It's a rather un-talked-about game for what it is IMO."
playstation,3clrn1,Sean_The_Pawn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:38:55 2015 UTC,"God Of War is great. Great stories, puzzles and the battles are bloody and violent. AFAIK, there are 4 parts, 1,2,3 and Ascension, but I'm not sure Ascension came out on the PS3.  As for me, I enjoyed Gran Turismo, Red Dead Redemption, Beyond: Two Souls, Mirror's Edge. Despite underwhelming me at the time, GTA IV is one of the games I wish I had kept, maybe nostalgia is a factor, but I think the storyline was better than GTA V and it was a huge step up graphics wise from San Andreas. Definitely worth a play through if you haven't already!"

The Last of Us obviously. The Uncharted series if you're into that.  I also recommend Batman: Arkham Asylum, and Batman: Arkham City (not sure about origins). Enslaved: Odyssey to the West was a very underrated post apocalyptic representation of old eastern folklore which I also really enjoyed. Heavy Rain is great after about an hour into the game and I just couldn't stop playing that. Infamous 1 and 2 were fantastically fun super hero games. Ratchet and Clank Future: A Crack in Time is in my top five list of all time favorite games ever and if you like that game, Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is also pretty good gameplay wise."

playstation,3cc4ph,sstacks,3,Mon Jul 6 19:31:49 2015 UTC,The efficiency is power supply related and in my opinion PS4 isn't a noise console. The weight doesn't matter for me.

But damn it's noisy, when playing second son it blows hard, like a gaming pc under load with stock fans.   For the new buyers I hope they made it quieter, it would be definitely a better experience not having to wear headphones to play or needing to crank up the tv volume."

This one becomes silent pretty much instantly when exiting a game, but in-game it blows hard. Maybe it's normal, maybe not. I'll never know. There are people who play killzone and tlou and say theirs is whisper quiet.. don't really know if to believe them or not.  For comparison, my ps3 slim under load makes half the noise of my ps4."

playstation,3c62wx,xAmorphous,16,Sun Jul 5 07:45:36 2015 UTC,"What Playstation system(s) do you have?  As others have said, you currently get 2 games per system (PS4/PS3/PS Vita), and oftentimes they're cross buy with the other systems, so if you don't have all the systems, then you'll sometimes end up with extra games for your system(s) of choice.  Having just one system means a minimum of 24 games for your $50, about $2.08 per game.  But if you're picky about what you play, it might not be such a good deal.  The quantity is meaningless if you don't like the lineup, and at the present time, the monthly lineups more heavily favor indie games and experimental titles over AAA blockbusters.  I don't mind at all, but it frustrates some people.  Keep in mind that the games are not yours to keep indefinitely; you can only access them if you're currently subscribed to Playstation Plus.  It's sort of like renting them, but ridiculously generous in the long run. I've been a subscriber for two years now, and I can still go back and play any of the games I got from my subscription then, and even the games I got from a free trial four years ago.  You should check out the current lineup of games, and hold off on subscribing if they're unappealing to you.  No sense in starting your membership until there are games you're interested in playing.  But the games will change this Tuesday, so if you do like the current lineup of games, then subscribe right away if you can, or else you'll miss your chance to snag them.  If you decide to subscribe, make sure to ""purchase"" all of the free games (even though your total will be $0.00) before they expire.  If you don't ""purchase"" them before they expire, it'll be too late and you won't ever be able to go back and get them for free."

Also, I have made SUCH an amazing community of friends online through ps plus. If you can afford it, PLEASE make every effort.  Also, when you get it, you actually get 6 free games a month because you get two more games for the ps3 and 2 games for the vita as well.

PS Now is currently entirely separate from PS+ from what I understand.   Have you thought about picking up a PS3 on the cheap and then using the PSN+ subscription on both? They are still providing content on the PS3, you would get games to play on both each month and then you could pick up those older titles on the cheap somewhere and be set.

playstation,3c2m8x,rogue780,0,Sun Jul 5 13:20:43 2015 UTC,"It's pure logic. All of the letters in the touchpad decrease surface area. When sliding your finger across the touchpad, the sensor under the touchpad could potentially lose contact with your finger everytime your finger crosses one of the patterns. I'm not saying it will, but it potentially could. I wouldn't want to risk it. My preference goes to black anyway."
playstation,3c2m8x,Bounkass,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:33:25 2015 UTC,"Except the pattern goes into the touchpad, not raised. For the purposes of a capacitive touchpad, distance from the sensor is what matters. So you're never going to exceed the normal distance as any other pad.  Also, what game are you playing where the touchpad's accuracy becomes a factor?"
playstation,3c2m8x,rogue780,0,Mon Jul 6 02:53:36 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter whether it's raised or sinked, it's not flat, this losing contact either way. I have no idea which games require touchpad accuracy, hence the word ""potentially"". Multiple times."

However, the answer is you would need a hdd that's exFAT or HFS file system compatible and able to be recognized wireless by a Playstation device. Ps4s media player will stream from a pc (not sure about Mac).  From any searches I've done almost all of them recommend using plex. So as long as you can input data on to the device and read it using plex it should work on any OS. You could even get fancy with a plex dedicated server.

playstation,3c5vyz,Harleequin,3,Sun Jul 5 02:59:04 2015 UTC,"The PS TV is basically a PS Vita game system without a screen. Instead you hook it up to your TV and pair a PS4 or PS3 controller with it. To answer your questions:  You can play PS Vita game cartridges or downloaded games on the PS TV. Games that extensively use the touch screen or motion sensing functions are not compatible.  There are some bundles that come with The LEGO Movie Video Game and/or Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time, as well as a PS3 controller.  When streaming your PS4 to your PS Vita or PS TV, the same thing is displayed on both the PS4's screen and the PS TV's.  I would say the primary function if the device is playing PS Vita and downloaded PSP and PS1 games on your TV."

playstation,3c5vyz,Andrew129260,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:54:23 2015 UTC,It does in fact have a PS Vita Card slot. The PS TV has a PS Vita Card slot and a PS Vita Memory Card slot. They're hidden on the side.
playstation,3c5vyz,CompC,0,Sun Jul 5 20:05:53 2015 UTC,"So all my PS+ vita games can be played on PS TV?  Also does the PS TV have a cartridge spot for Vita games?  If I already have a vita, is there a cord I can use too hook it up to the TV / pair a DS4 with it, ie, would I need a TV if I have a vita already?  Thanks for answering some of my questions by the way!"
playstation,3c5vyz,Andrew129260,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:32:13 2015 UTC,"No. Most games do not work on the vita TV as they are incompatible until the developer releases a patch to make the game work with PS TV. I disagree with the above statement that you should buy it for the games, because it doesn't have a lot. The main reason I purchased it was for remote pkay for ps4 (its main purpose) and for that it does it well. Of course quality is even better wired. The best game that is compatible on pstv is killzone mercenary and that is really cool. But don't expect all your vita games to work on PS TV.       You can plug your vita memory card that you have games installed on and plug it into the pstv. It has a slot for cartridge games as well. If a game doesnt work try updating it and then try again. Hope that helps."

I know the wording does not imply that in the reward descriptions, I guess because they haven't updated them from the original descriptions. But in the campaign update, it says this   All backers pledging for a $60 Reward tier or higher, will have the option of a PS4 Physical Copy as their platform choice.  After the Kickstarter finishes, a survey will be sent out to backers in these tiers to confirm your choice of platform. Choose one of the following:     PS4 Physical Copy  PS4 Digital Copy     Windows PC Physical Copy  Windows PC Digital Copy.     So yeah, you'll be fine."

playstation,3bviyj,anr-k_Main,24,Thu Jul 2 14:24:12 2015 UTC,"I'm normally a PC gamer - occasionally i'll play on my Xbox or my PS3.  For me FPS has always been a thing I like to be at 60, but the general feeling from console gamers is that it doesn't matter as long as you get smooth games that look great.  Thoughts?"
playstation,3bviyj,yarfmeister,7,Thu Jul 2 14:25:11 2015 UTC,"As long as the framerate is stable. I'd rather have consistent 30 than jumping between 30-40-50-60. Ultimately framerate and resolution, and even graphical fidelity to a degree, come second to gameplay. If the game is fun to play, 30 fps and/or 720p is perfectly fine."
playstation,3bviyj,kungfusteeze,15,Thu Jul 2 22:21:41 2015 UTC,"I say I upsets me that the PS4 can't handle more games at 60fps. But if its at least locked at 30, I can handle it. Cant really change how the PS4 runs, so I just gotta live with games like this being stuck at 30."
playstation,3bviyj,OneFreamon,13,Thu Jul 2 14:32:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think 30 is all that bad once you've been played for a while, you just get used to it. Moving from game running at 60+ to a game at 30 is horrible though."
playstation,3bviyj,errandum,13,Thu Jul 2 14:46:02 2015 UTC,"The problem is not the they can't handle, it's just that they keep adding stuff because 30 is acceptable. Quite sure that if it had twice the power, games would still run at 30fps. Until we can get photorealism in games at Super ultra ultimate HD and 60fps, the balance should tip further to the side of 30 than 60."
playstation,3bviyj,Infraction94,5,Thu Jul 2 19:55:01 2015 UTC,Exactly this. Developers are simply saying would we rather add some cool awesome features or have a higher framerate and the majority say they want more features and have been for a REALLY long time.
playstation,3bviyj,IndridCipher,5,Fri Jul 3 03:46:11 2015 UTC,"PS4 can absolutely do 60 fps games. Its a decision the developer makes between doing 60 fps and cutting back some graphical features or using the features and accepting 30 fps.  Uncharted 4 could be 60 fps Naughty Dog wanted it to be but 30 is acceptable to a vast majority of their audience.  No matter how powerful a console is, this decision will always have to be made."
playstation,3bviyj,kungfusteeze,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:00:46 2015 UTC,"I know. I should have worded it different. I want a game as impressive and crazy as Uncharted 4 to have no issue running locked 60fps, that level of power on PS4 would be nice."
playstation,3bviyj,IndridCipher,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:18:42 2015 UTC,ok but if the ps4 had that level of power.  Its totally plausible that Naughty Dog would make it look that much better and still run it at 30 fps.  I'm just saying no matter how powerful PS4 was or PS5 is in the future.  Some developers will chose to have 30 FPS games.
playstation,3bviyj,TelMegiddo,3,Fri Jul 3 10:37:48 2015 UTC,"I hear a lot on both sides and it reminds me of the SDTV - HDTV debate a while back. Yeah, the lower standard is technically fine, but there isn't much reason to ignore the better quality that exists and can be taken advantage of - generally for economic or time reasons.   My bottom line... Whether we can live with 30 is irrelevant. 60 is noticeably better across the board and only by demanding it will it become industry standard. Almost all gamers benefited from the HD upgrade and the same will be true for this."
playstation,3bviyj,Greyfells,4,Fri Jul 3 00:06:07 2015 UTC,"I think console gamers are used to it, that's really it. I personally prefer less pretty graphics and 60FPS, but I guess visuals matter more to some people.  I will say this though, the ""30 is fine"" mentality wouldn't exist if 60 was the norm."
playstation,3bviyj,BlueBlur8,2,Thu Jul 2 23:03:10 2015 UTC,"I never once thought about fps until the ps4 came out. I've played the hell out of the first 3 in 30fps, I can't let it bother me now."
playstation,3bviyj,bringyoutomyhell,-1,Fri Jul 3 00:23:31 2015 UTC,"Whenever I can I lock my games at 30fps, primarily because my PS4 makes less noise this way.

playstation,3bviyj,holderofthechalic,-9,Fri Jul 3 14:13:57 2015 UTC,"Most people have played both 30 and 60 and still wouldn't be able to tell you the difference. If its only a small minority that would even recognize the difference, why spend so much time optimizing for it."
playstation,3bviyj,theswerto,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:17:55 2015 UTC,Anyone can tell the difference between 30 and 60. It's a much smoother experience. 30 isn't unplayable or terrible (sub 30 is) but it's very noticeable.
playstation,3bviyj,holderofthechalic,0,Thu Jul 2 20:37:10 2015 UTC,"Im not saying its not noticeable, jesus christ people the downvote button is NOT the disagree button. If you think im wrong just use your fucking words. If you read my comment again, I said most people have seen both 60 and 30 but most likely wouldn't be able to tell you the difference. Im not one of those people, I know the difference, I know 60 is smoother. But many times I have encountered people who have been playing video games much longer than I have and they cant tell the difference. And when I say they cant tell the difference I mean If you put them through a blind test of a 60fps FPS and then had them play a 3rd person game running at 30fps, the average person (someone who is more likely to buy a console over a PC) will not be able to tell you the difference, or know how frame rate relates to gameplay."
playstation,3bviyj,TelMegiddo,0,Thu Jul 2 20:51:39 2015 UTC,"the downvote button is NOT the disagree button.    You are correct, however it is being used to downvote incorrect information. You make quite an assertion (that most people have seen both 30 and 60 and, again, most would not notice a difference) with no evidence to support this."
playstation,3bviyj,holderofthechalic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:51:09 2015 UTC,"Anecdotal.   okay then Its not a fact its my opinion, an opinion shared by ND and Insomniac."
playstation,3bviyj,holderofthechalic,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:02:46 2015 UTC,"Also, can you tell me why im wrong? Because in my experience this seems to be the case. Only people who have been playing a majority of their games at 60fps would know and fully understand the differences. It seems to me that a casual wouldn't be able to catch it as easily as you or me, and they certainly wouldn't be asking for 60fps. Numerous times Ive had to explain the difference 60fps makes to casuals and long time console players."
playstation,3bviyj,TelMegiddo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:29:12 2015 UTC,"They don't notice because they aren't exposed to it. Why do you think PC gamers noticed in the first place? Because it simply is noticeable.   I would argue, also without evidence so take it with a grain of salt, that you could take the average console gamer you describe and give them ten games - five at 30 and five at 60 - and most of them would notice the difference on their own."
playstation,3bviyj,holderofthechalic,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:47:27 2015 UTC,"So... the first part of your comment is exactly what ive been saying.. That being, they wouldn't know the difference because they aren't exposed to it (as often as a PC gamer) I would bet that most console gamers have played a game at 60fps and don't know it. You don't need to add a disclaimer to your comments, im not going to down vote you because I think you're wrong. And I do think you're wrong. Would they notice a difference? probably, but they wouldn't be able to identify frame rate as the reason for the smoother feeling."
playstation,3bviyj,TelMegiddo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:56:14 2015 UTC,You don't have to understand how something works to be able to appreciate it.
playstation,3bviyj,holderofthechalic,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:04:03 2015 UTC,"Thats not my point. My point is if most of the people that are going to buy Uncharted 4 wouldnt even be able to explain what frame rate does for gameplay, then why optimize for it? Most people that are buying an 8th Gen console are doing so because they want better graphics, not better performance. Anyone can point out the jump in resolution from 720p to 1080p just as anyone can tell the difference in character models from U3 to U4. Its much easier to sell a game on graphics than frame rate because high frame rates aren't an established trope in the world of consoles (much to the chagrin of Sony and Microsoft)"
playstation,3bviyj,holderofthechalic,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:12:27 2015 UTC,Source?
playstation,3bviyj,waffelwarrior,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:45:58 2015 UTC,For what? ask anyone around you that doesn't follow gaming news sites or forums like we do. We are the minority of people who can tell the difference between 30 and 60 and can explain why 60 is better. We are the even smaller minority that want a high frame rate over pretty visuals on consoles. Remember how small a minority we are in. Most people wont care or know why they should care about high frame rates.
playstation,3bviyj,holderofthechalic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:56:24 2015 UTC,"Dude, I'd understand if you said that few see the difference between 60 and 100, but, 30 to 60 is noticeable by anyone"

playstation,3bviyj,mrstejdm,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:51:21 2015 UTC,"Why are people surprised at stuff like this? On the PS4's limited hardware you have the choice of gorgeous graphics or high frame rate, not both. The hardware is already starting to age compared to the PCs out there. Developers can only get so much out of the PS4s hardware."
playstation,3bviyj,mrstejdm,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:36:14 2015 UTC,Many thought the new generation would bring 60 FPS as the standard for console games. Developers have 2 options. Make games look a lot better and run at 30 FPS or make the games look only marginally better and run at 60 FPS.   What option do you think a developer will pick?   The previous generation was fully capable of running games @ 60 FPS it's just the developers picked better looking games over frame-rate. No reason so think this will change in this generation.
playstation,3bviyj,waffelwarrior,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:38:44 2015 UTC,"with the amount of detail they're adding to the Uncharted world, id prefer 30 than a jerky 60.  Theyre making a smart decision to honour playability over circle jerking their fanbase. thats how you make a decent game."
playstation,3bviyj,TISparta217,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:23:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree that this is something that works well on console games.  Sooner or later though the developers and the engines they are using are going to have become more efficient at producing the quality and running it at 60fps

playstation,3bviyj,jokeren75,0,Fri Jul 3 14:23:56 2015 UTC,"Okay, well two cents here.  One 2014 theme is plain, boring and not a sign of a professional article or site. I cringe when I see it. Do not use, period. Its like keeping that 'rolling hills' wallpaper from Windows XP. Just dont.  There is a lot of free themes on the wordpress repo make use of it, you will find something that will do you for now, make it look pro without spending money on it. Get an audience but I assure you wont go far with a default WP theme.  Three. When you have the cash migrate your site to an actual domain, wordpress makes it easy to move what you have on their site to your own.  (its seriously not a lot, a .net is next to nothing and hosting a year can be 30 USD or so).   Four, You dont build a house by putting up four walls, a window, a door and slap random colours on it and calling it a day. No, and dont do this with websites. Wordpress makes it easy for not techys to make websites, this is a pro and my god it is a con. You will be lost in a sea of mediocrity if you dont put effort in to your site. Your colours clash like hell, ugly, an I'm no designer but look at this for a little bit of modern and eye pleasing colouring .This   Finally, sit down and learn it. I know you are getting started and thats fine but your site wont go far as is. Learn Wordpress, you dont need to be a coder, but if you want to jump into Web Dev, it's a nice portal to learn a well used platform and help others.   TL;DR I am a Web Dev, I've made tons of WP based sites. Have an upvote and goodluck"

There is a lot of tips I can give you in terms security and functionality so send me a DM and I'll throw a list of tips your way which will be helpful when you take the site to your own host and domain.   Pro tip in the meantime.. (I'm not sure how to edit the files on a wordpress.com hosted site but just visit the Editor tab in the backend and do some CSS.

playstation,3bwdsw,flyingcloud11,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:31:34 2015 UTC,"PayPal is directly tied to a VISA Electron card (which is literally a ""put/recharge money on it and then spend it later"" type of card).  Also, why PSN should be concerned about it? PayPal's money source is not their concern; isn't the concept of PayPal to avoid being inquired by online stores (not that I have anything to hide but, hell, no single US store even asked me anything outside of my PP account)."

DLC on the other hand is region-specific depending on the version of the game. That means that your friend might need an australian PSN account in order to download DLC for a disc based game he bought in Australia.  Same applies to games from Europe, Japan, Hong Kong, etc. -> The discs will play fine but DLC (or download codes that come with the game) will need a corresponding PSN account."

I take it your on the same console as you used previously when it worked, if not, make sure you set it to the primary console for the PSN account you're using.  And make sure you haven't changed the billing address on the CC you're using to AU, it needs to be in US, otherwise get a US pre-paid PSN card online, places like G2A and cdkeys sell them."

playstation,3bo30n,moonalchemist,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:19:17 2015 UTC,"Close, but no. That stand renders the controller completely unplayable. What I'm looking for holds the controller and has it always plugged in and allows me to play it just like the test systems at Wal-Mart or gamestop."
playstation,3bn2q7,kyhoopsgoat,3,Tue Jun 30 15:25:12 2015 UTC,I've left mine at defaults with no complaints. I only need to adjust chat vs game level and there controls fir that on the side
playstation,3bn2q7,LXicon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:42:07 2015 UTC,"Thank for the feedback.   Last night, I uploaded the Destiny pre-set and then just the basic Shooter pre-set and couldn't really tell much of a difference between the 2.   The headset is very nice with crisp sound, it is just finding that balance between the game and party chat that has been the most difficult."
playstation,3bn2q7,thehead21,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:46:42 2015 UTC,"I uploaded the preset for Arkham Knight, and it was a huge improvement."
playstation,3bn2q7,dneill99,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:25:51 2015 UTC,"If it's an RGP or Action based with lots of dialog or cutscenes, it might be worth trying out the preset. 90% of the other games the default works best than the preloads or categories. Also after you listen to the default for a while it starts to sound normal so the other presets tend to sound off or wrong. TLDR: Stick to presets and just mess with bass when needed and chat volume when needed."
playstation,3bll8i,ateURdog,3,Tue Jun 30 05:20:06 2015 UTC,Same here. Bloody server matinence.

playstation,3bll8i,mtlyoshi9,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:01:38 2015 UTC,Hopefully it goes without saying that you should play the Uncharted series if you haven't already. I also strongly recommend the inFamous games.

playstation,3bjteg,haydar1994,7,Tue Jun 30 01:35:44 2015 UTC,I just hope its not a continuing story. It ended perfectly and I feel like it would tarnish that. Do some new characters and new location?
playstation,3bjteg,doublewhiskey88,2,Tue Jun 30 01:32:01 2015 UTC,They have made quite the world so I think they have plenty of opportunity explore it.  It would be interesting to see what other countries are like.

playstation,3bjteg,ManOfIronAnSteel,3,Mon Jun 29 23:32:52 2015 UTC,Exactly. They apparently did a heap of work for Jak 4 and then decided it wasnt right so they ran with The Last of Us. Thats what i heard and read anyway.
playstation,3bms3u,DanGibson2301,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:04:23 2015 UTC,Maybe this case due to the PSN server maintenance. You have to contact with the Support and show them the order recipe.
playstation,3bl577,derpydash12,3,Tue Jun 30 02:48:19 2015 UTC,Cinematic $60 film pretty much.
playstation,3bl577,The_Dreadnaught,2,Tue Jun 30 05:23:54 2015 UTC,"I loved The Order: 1886 as a experience, however it wasn't alot of gameplay. Playing the entire game took me about 15 hours, which was about 10 hours of gameplay, and 5 hours cinematic. People just didn't think it was worth $60 for a ""movie game"". Would have been so dope as a open world game"
playstation,3bl577,roxkyp,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:44:46 2015 UTC,I haven't played it but I hear it's really shirt / filled with quick time events. I've been waiting for the price to drop. I'd give it a try for $25

playstation,3bl577,iamnotseanclark,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:26:41 2015 UTC,"I liked the game, only problems I had with it were that they didn't explore the plot as much as they could have , and it was really short"
playstation,3bl577,wuvius,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:21:06 2015 UTC,"The graphics is perfect and every item is detailed but the game time will take no more than 5 hours and the gameplay is a little bit boring. Above them, it is expensive as hell."
playstation,3bl577,almightyNTER,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:15:19 2015 UTC,"I got on sale for $30 and it was a perfect price in my opinion. It's basically a movie with a bad plot. Neither the characters or the story are fleshed out or explained very well. It ends on a 'wait for the sequel!' type ending, and the gameplay is very standard-third-person-shooter. It's beautiful, and worth a run, but not worth $60. It's also a pretty easy Platinum if you're into that sorta thing."
playstation,3bl577,VonSnuggles,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:02:16 2015 UTC,"i enjoyed the game, and it looked great.  but unfortunately they were riding the hype train along with the fans and didn't care to much of the final product. story was short. not much ""Gameplay"" and being linear was fine for me but definitely not enough to see and do in that linear path.   Ooo and getting 100% trophies is easily done in the first play through. which is sad.   6.5/10"
playstation,3bjb4h,JakeSmif,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:12:48 2015 UTC,Not that I know of. You might want to see if cleaning out the slot will help get it working again.

playstation,3bi6pv,FPardo93,9,Mon Jun 29 12:45:18 2015 UTC,Back up your ps4 using the backup utilty to an external drive. When putting a new drive in the ps4 will prompt to format it. Then restore backup. Everything will be just like it was. Games and saves
playstation,3bi6pv,Andrew129260,2,Mon Jun 29 13:36:44 2015 UTC,"Yup, the PS4 encrypts the data on the drive. You can't move a drive from one PS4 to another with the data intact. As /u/Andrew129260 said, you'll need to backup & restore or re-download."
playstation,3bi6pv,LXicon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:07:45 2015 UTC,"he'll also need to redownload the firmware to an usb stick, and deactivate the previous console"
playstation,3bi6pv,bringyoutomyhell,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:33:34 2015 UTC,The PS3 has a connect both to the network and Xfer menu item? Is the PS4 gigabit? I still would think the backup is a good idea.
playstation,3bi6pv,n2kra,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:50:07 2015 UTC,I haven't had to transfer data between PS4s yet but i recalled the PS3 data transfer utility and i couldn't find anything similar for the PS4.

playstation,3bi6pv,bringyoutomyhell,6,Mon Jun 29 15:32:34 2015 UTC,My ps4 is very quiet. Is yours loud?
playstation,3bi6pv,Andrew129260,2,Mon Jun 29 16:57:16 2015 UTC,It only becomes loud when running a game of massive size like Withcer or Bloodbourne and that's only when there's a lot of stuff going on on the screen
playstation,3bi6pv,Trogdor7861,2,Mon Jun 29 19:44:33 2015 UTC,Mine turns into a jet engine when I load up MGSV ground zeroes.

playstation,3bi6pv,bringyoutomyhell,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:34:08 2015 UTC,"Yep, I changed the first one, the second one is quieter but still very loud with many games (TLoU, Infamous etc.), I can hear it with headphones on, and there are about 50% of ps4 owners that has one like that. Quiet ones or doesn't exist, or are very, very rare (and of course hearing noise can be subjective)"
playstation,3bi6pv,bringyoutomyhell,2,Mon Jun 29 18:27:16 2015 UTC,Hmm interesting. Mine has been insanely quiet I don't even know its on unless I see the light. Both with stick drive and the 2tb I have now. Hopefully it's not to bad that it breaks or anything

playstation,3bir3d,almightyNTER,-3,Tue Jun 30 10:25:57 2015 UTC,It's really the same except for that hard drive. You can replace that one or ones in the current ps4s. Besides that there is no indication that they are different.
playstation,3bir3d,Parabola7001,2,Mon Jun 29 16:10:18 2015 UTC,So is it just better to get the 500GB one and then just replace the hard drive if needed than paying the extra £80 approx?
playstation,3bir3d,Stardust-Nova,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:22:41 2015 UTC,"For reference, I bought myself a 1TB SSHD for about $90 USD, and I've seen 2TB HDDs for around the same. It'd be easier to just buy a 2TB if you need the space, and for probably the same price as getting the 1TB model, unless you really want the new model, which AFAIK, has better power savings, a matte finish all around, and is a little lighter."
playstation,3bir3d,XSlor,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:05:09 2015 UTC,I don't think 1TB is enough... I slapped a 2TB into my PS4 and it's half full...

playstation,3bmglj,hunka130,2,Tue Jun 30 13:56:24 2015 UTC,Yup. So take notes! Never leave your console in the marketplace when you are using the TV for other things... you might just bump your controller and buy a title by mistake.
playstation,3bmglj,Andrew129260,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:19:25 2015 UTC,It is kind of your fault. Do you have it set to ask for your password for purchases? That is what I do and I never had a purchase or refund issue.
playstation,3bmglj,radewagon,0,Wed Jul 1 17:06:35 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that the problem with refunds on Sony's system is as follows:   Games from the PSN, in general, don't need online authentication each time they are played. So, if you were to purchase and download a game to your Playstation 4 and then call Sony to get a refund, you'd basically have a free game on your hard drive that you could continue to play regardless of it being removed from your account. If Sony were more lenient with their refund policy, this is the kind of thing that would be VERY easy to exploit."
playstation,3bmglj,chew85,-1,Wed Jul 1 15:23:56 2015 UTC,"They're the worst.  I accidentally bought a game for PS3 when I meant to buy it for PS4.  Got on chat with Sony within 1-2 minutes of the accidental purchase and they acted like they were doing me the biggest favor in the world by refunding my money in exchange for the PS4 version.  I think the email said it is my ""one time exception"".  ridiculous. edit: and they didn't actually refund my money, just put credit in my sony wallet."
playstation,3bmglj,pizzatoppings88,3,Wed Jul 1 00:48:27 2015 UTC,"I whole heartedly agree :) Look. Normally I wouldn't even bat an eyebrow at a mistake like this. I really wouldn't as I understand it is not an to this world or existence. It still doesn't change the fact that this is a cruel joke played by sony on our expenses.  They have no system deliberately to gain on peoples mistakes. Then they blame it on not having a system. That is because they don't want a system to refund so they can earn more. Worst customer care I've seen so far. People have to work a lot to pay for these titles, and when this kind of stuff happens it really makes you question why you support them in the first place. Would be better off with a pc and have the opportunity to refund.  It is so easy to for them to remove all PS3 titles from a ps4 system so that mistake won't happen. I've been a programmer for many years and that stuff is 101. It is done purposefully and that is what makes me so annoyed with this whole situation. Consider yourself lucky! :D"

playstation,3bj6wu,XSlor,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:53:02 2015 UTC,"You said you ""know the system isn't backwards compatible, but surely it should work for digital downloads?""  I'm curious about what makes you think because you download the game instead of buying it on a disk that you might think it's a different game. I just wonder what a new consumer thinks, not taking a dig at you.  Are you looking on the PSN website, I could see that causing confusion since everything is listed there.  Cruise through the PSN store on your PS4, that will filter out all other games that won't work on it. System is in it's second year, Ps3 was out for almost a decade so just keep that in mind."
playstation,3bj6wu,dneill99,2,Mon Jun 29 21:33:32 2015 UTC,"All fine and good.  I didn't figure it was a different game, but what I was wondering is what exactly prohibits me from playing a ps3 game.  If it were the disc itself, then I wouldn't see why a digital download wouldn't work.  Consoles are basically computers specialized for gaming, so if it has the ability, I don't know what exactly is limiting it from doing so."
playstation,3bj6wu,NoozeHound,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:11:41 2015 UTC,"The PS4 is radically different to the PS3 architecture.  When it first came out the PS3 was considered difficult to develop for because of it's hardware. All PS3 games were designed and built for this specific hardware.  The PS4 uses mostly PC-style components to make it easier to develop for, which is why it will never be backwardly compatible.  If there are specific PS3 games that you want to play your best option is to pick up a good second-hand rig and use it with your PS+ subscription, particularly if you have been 'buying' the PS3 titles in the IGC."

playstation,3bft1m,Harborcoat84,2,Mon Jun 29 06:09:14 2015 UTC,"Bluetooth. Only the main menu and select games are supported. There's a list somewhere, they were adding more I don't know if they still are."
playstation,3bft1m,soliddewitt,2,Mon Jun 29 06:11:28 2015 UTC,Plug it in with USB. PS button doesn't work but that's about it. Most games work well.
playstation,3bft1m,DJGeorgeWashington,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:25:47 2015 UTC,"If you already have 4, you could always trade the crappiest one in to GS. They actually pay pretty well for controllers, especially if you catch them on a 50% extra deal."

playstation,3bft1m,MrCrossa,3,Mon Jun 29 01:08:27 2015 UTC,"The DS4 is soooo much better for the PC though.  Being able to map commands to the touchpad is super useful.  For example, in Witcher 3, I've got map mapped to swipe up, inventory to swipe, quests to swipe right, character to swipe left."

playstation,3bft1m,varky,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:48:04 2015 UTC,You could always grab one for your eventual PS4? I had a DS4 for about 3 months before I got a PS4 because one of my DS3s broke and I needed a second PS3 controller.

playstation,3bi8f2,Fabien_Lamour,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:03:22 2015 UTC,The only thing I would suggest is to maybe try and reinstall the game? Other than that try a different controller and see if it persists?
playstation,3bi8f2,Beatle_Matt,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:37:19 2015 UTC,"Mine did that, then it did it in Far Cry 4 as well.  I ended up buying a new controller, as the original one has about 1500 hours of FPS gaming on it. That trigger was bound to be iffy by now.  The new controller works fine in both games... I've yet to have any issue in Destiny with the old controller, but Far Cry 4 occasionally ignores the RT input still. I haven't played Ground Zeroes again with the old one."

Every now and then for some odd reason it will sit forever and cannot find a match; and all you have to do is just back out and restart. It then finds one almost immediately.

playstation,3bf7u2,DarkOstrava,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:15:35 2015 UTC,That's a DS4 not a DS3. The buy button is also blocked off as it's sold out.  Thanks anyway though.
playstation,3bfatu,sillycrazywillyguy,4,Sun Jun 28 18:35:10 2015 UTC,"On PS4, you can just go to the library (all the way on the right side of the content bar) to find all the titles you own, and initiate a re-download from there.  On PS3 or Vita you have to go back to the Store to find the games you own.  (You can do this on PS4 too, if you prefer.) Make sure you're logged in with the account that purchased the game, and it should allow you to download it again for free without hassle.  But as a general rule, don't agree to any unexpected charges — if it brings you to a checkout page and says it wants to charge you more than $0.00, you should back out and then figure out what went wrong before trying again.  Doesn't matter whose fault it is, you'll be the one contacting Sony to try and get a refund if it happens."

Personally I like the gloss and I'm with you OP, I was a little disappointed that imo the PS4 is getting uglier, but as others have said, scratches and dust love the gloss, and it looks a bit less distracting in a TV unit if it's matte."

I would remove all your information from the account (your name, billing info, etc.) and replace it with bogus info until the new owner can takeover the account.  I'd also set the password to something that can be easily changed for the new owner.

playstation,3b473s,dnuohxof,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:52:56 2015 UTC,You need to go to your PS3 settings and make sure display outputs through whatever you use for display (hdmi/composite) and go to audio and make sure audio goes through wherever you want audio to go
playstation,3b473s,ndpratas,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:23:16 2015 UTC,"The audio won't go through the speaker, ps3 doesn't have support for audio over bluetooth"
playstation,3b473s,ndpratas,2,Thu Jun 25 22:27:58 2015 UTC,"This is the right answer.   You can however use the included ps3 cable to get the audio output. Just connect those two RCA plugs (white and red) to an adpter like THIS and plug the jack to your bluetooth speaker. If you have a proper amplifier (like an old stereo or something) with analog audio input, you can just skip the adapter and plug the standard PS3 cable to it.  Good luck. Oh, and don't forget to set the output right on the settings menu."

playstation,3azvvt,SteveMcQwark,10,Wed Jun 24 21:38:04 2015 UTC,"They are both customized versions of the same processor design, yes. That's not the problem. The problem is that last generation, the PS3 used a much more unique processor architecture than the Xbox 360 did, so it's easier to emulate the Xbox 360 on the newer consoles than it is to emulate the PS3.  In particular, while the PS3 and 360 used essentially the same general-purpose core in their processors, the Xbox 360 had three of them, while the PS3 had one, complemented by a larger number of more specialized cores. Both of the newer consoles use multiple general-purpose cores this time around, so Xbox 360 software translates more directly to the modern systems than PS3 software does."

IMHO the cell processor could have been kept with just the graphics processor and interconnect hardware being updated but going for an x86 architecture makes sense for developers because it doesn't involve massive amounts of bespoke hardware and most of the code is the same as for the PC.  The only real difference in developing for a PS4 now and the PC is the compiler you use.  TLDR: I have seen (shitty) Xbox 360 emulators for PC, have you seen a PS3 one??"

playstation,3av5h5,SylarXYZ,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:47:08 2015 UTC,"Being a free game that makes all of it's money on micro-transactions, how does it compare, gameplay-wise, to the big budget AAA FPS games like cod and battlefield?"
playstation,3av5h5,killit,2,Wed Jun 24 12:02:24 2015 UTC,"Think of it on a more massive scale. Where Battlefield has a big battle area where you jump into a game and play, Planetside has planets. Literally these huge sprawling planets where you and your army do battle to capture points. You will unlock items, be able to get new armor, unlock vehicles, etc. as you play, but it's much more open and much less direct than a Battlefield game. It's worth checking out if you like big open shooters, although try not to compare it to the big budget Battlefield game and I think you'll really enjoy it."
playstation,3av5h5,VA1N,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:56:15 2015 UTC,"It definitely sounds interesting, don't think I've ever played anything quite like it."
playstation,3av5h5,killit,2,Wed Jun 24 13:12:20 2015 UTC,"I played it a bit on the PC and had a really fun time with it. Finding some people to join a squad with and going from point to point can be a ton of fun. When you truly get a massive battle going and you're fighting over one spot for like 30 minutes, it's really fun. But then there are the times when you're running from spot to spot without seeing anyone and it gets a little repetitive. Thankfully, once you get your bearings in the game, you can fast travel/get vehicles/etc. to help."
playstation,3av5h5,VA1N,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:16:45 2015 UTC,"The trailer certainly looks nice, does it feel as polished as battlefield or cod?    (i know they aren't perfect but they both feel good to control and generally speaking, both are quite well put together in their own regards)"
playstation,3av5h5,killit,2,Wed Jun 24 13:36:29 2015 UTC,You're going to get more lag in Planetside because of the sheer size. Same with framerate. CoD and Battlefield have a smaller scale so they can focus on more direct approaches to fixing things. It may not be as polished but it is very serviceable.

playstation,3ap7c6,omracer,2,Mon Jun 22 18:29:56 2015 UTC,what is tdp?
playstation,3ap7c6,JelloOstriches,5,Mon Jun 22 19:45:03 2015 UTC,Thermal Design Power
playstation,3ap7c6,preekam,5,Mon Jun 22 19:49:56 2015 UTC,"Thermal Design Power is a measure of how much heat the PS4 could ever create at any one time. Major lowerings of TDP come from redesigning the CPU or GPU. (APU in this case) TDP can also be lowered by redesigning the way power flows through the motherboard, or installing a more efficient power supply.  Redesigning the heatsink or fan does not lower TDP because it still produces the same amount of heat. It is nice to have it dealt with more efficiently, though.  A lower TDP or better cooling setup makes for a more durable PS4, as power is more efficiently consumed by the system, creating less heat, creating less wear on the system.  Source: IT Undergrad"

VR seems like its going to be the new Kinect/Move for 2016, entirely too much focus for the peripheral from Microsauce and hardly any from Sony even though I am sure it'll be cool as fck, just struggling to see it being the new status quo method of experiencing games.  Other than that, Fallout 4 is the only game I see taking all my time end of year. I even thought of building a new PC rig to play some PC only games, MOBAs...MOBAs for days, jesus its like nothing truly new anywhere, sigh*  If you are innovative and have some capital you could be an easy millionaire in the industry right now, so much redundancy lately.

(Not standby mode)   No you can't, it needs to be in standby mode.    2) If you can't, how long can it stay in standby mode before it breaks?   Not sure what you mean here. You can always leave it in standby mode. The only risk is that if your power goes out, it could damage it. But if it happens it would still likely be fine.    3) If the system needs a system update, can I install it using Remote Play?    Yes. You can also go into your setting and have it install system updates automatically.. If it's in standby mode.   Hope that helps!   Edit: if Ethernet is an option, I'd go for it.

It's really frustrating so I just use my phone and drag the slider to middle of my playlist on my phone and shuffle from there. It usually yields a much better result but at launch I was frustrated with it."

playstation,3ahvey,FightMelRL,5,Sat Jun 20 09:20:01 2015 UTC,Well I don't think Sony is going to work on hardware anytime soon as from a design point of view they're ahead of the xbox.   However they are probably going to focus more on software updates and games for now at least.   So yeah go for it as i don't think there's going to be any design upgrades this year or the first half of next year.
playstation,3ahvey,S_NiggaH,5,Sat Jun 20 09:53:48 2015 UTC,"Currently there's no information on any special hardware revisions, slim versions, or anything like that for the moment. There were rumours of a 1TB edition, but it'll cost more and the PS4 HDD is already upgradeable, so you don't need to worry about it.  The PS2 slim came out about half way through the PS2's life span,  since the PS4 is supposed to last between 6-10 years it's reasonable to assume a slim PS4 won't be released for at least another couple of years. Also keep in mind that the PS4 is a relatively small console already, and it will take Sony some time to make it small enough and cheap enough to be worth re-releasing as a slim model.  As an Australian, $400 is a pretty good deal, my PS4 and XB1 were both $550-ish. If there's anywhere that sells them cheaper I haven't found it. Good luck with everything."
playstation,3ahvey,IamAnthonological,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:34:50 2015 UTC,"PS4 hard drive is  VERY VERY easy to replace so I dont even see a major HD upgrade coming. Also ps2 slim took 4 years to come out, ps3 slim took 3. Neither slim versions had any hardware upgrades worth mentioning, so are you going to wait another 2 years to buy the ps4 slim? Which to be perfectly honest I am not sure will be coming, Sony was pretty on point this time around.    Took this from a previous post I made on same topic so sorry if it reads a bit strange."

If you do get plus always download or ""free purchase"" all the ps+ games each month even if you don't have a vita or PS3. If you ever do get one of them, you'll have an instant library of games.

Remote play is not good for twitchy competitive shooters but is an amazing feature.   Then there is ps now on vita. You can rent and play ps3 games. I hope they start adding ps1, ps2 and psp games to the service.   Vita has a huge library when you include ps one classics and psp games.

I've never heard of a banned Vita, but I would bet it can happen. also if it is a launch Vita, the battery is probably starting to show its age (the Vita launched over three years ago), no matter how well it was cared for. Make sure it can hold a decent charge, as it's no fun to play them plugged in. If it is a 2000, I'd be less worried about the battery, but still check it out.   I would not hold your breath for any killer future Vita releases. look at the current library, and if it interests you enough to justify the price, buy it. if you don't care about portability, there is also the PlayStation TV, which can often be had for far less than a Vita (but also can't play all the games a Vita can play).  take a look at /r/vita and /r/vitatv while you are at it."

You would have to find two females to one male splitter, most are one male to 2 female, so make sure you get the right one."

playstation,3a5q2c,RPeteG,88,Wed Jun 17 13:02:51 2015 UTC,"It makes sense. The PS3's architecture is an absolute nightmare, so I'm not surprised that they can't emulate it as easily as Microsoft could emulate the 360.  That said, despite the lack of true backwards compatibility, that doesn't address the fact that they've got a platform with which to provide that feature: PlayStation Now. By linking our PSN purchases to and/or checking for ""old"" discs against PSNow's library, they could allow us to play games we already own at no additional cost to the customers. This is unlikely as those servers cost money, but it's technically feasible. If they lose enough traction due to this change, they have the capability to open up PSNow to be more competitive."

The PS4 recognizes PS3 discs (as evident by any of those ""upgrade"" games during the earlier days of the console like Battlefield 4).

I tried it on the One and it really works well but I think it's just nice to have. People on the internet that shout ""MEGATON"" from the rooftops are a fraction of a percent of the install base, the truth is at 2 years in, very few people are shouting for this feature. I mean, I don't recall seeing many posts on the front page of any subreddit asking for BC once the consoles had launched, I check both r/PS4 and r/xboxone most days.  To say that they'll lose traction/sales because of it is a bit unrealistic, maybe in the US a few percent closer but I doubt in the rest of the world PS4 has anything to worry about.  PSNow needs some working out though price wise, Netflix style would be my preference but the tech is great, even in the UK with shoddy copper broadband. Plus it's on more than one device, PS3, PS4, Smart TV etc.  EDIT: I'd happily take some PS1 and PS2 emulation though Sony. Cheers."

playstation,3a5q2c,LoyolaProp1,5,Wed Jun 17 18:46:40 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the system seller part.  For holdouts, they won't start a generation with an empty library.  It'll reduce the initial cost of getting a system by not needing to buy a bunch of new games since they already have a library and they can trade in their old system without rendering all of their favorite games useless.

playstation,3a5q2c,Bizkets,2,Wed Jun 17 18:49:24 2015 UTC,"Seriously, what are the actual numbers on this?  This feature is always lauded and a ""must-have"", but why? Once the initial nostalgia fades you realize you're playing an out of date game. I get wanting to replay games, I really do (I still play Transport Tycoon /r/openttd), but I can't see why exactly it's such a big deal if there isn't an option to.  Also, I still own my PS2 and PS3.

I used my backwards compability on my PS3 for NFS carbon and FF7 and after that never really popped in any other past discs. Like you said it's an awesome feature to have until you pop in discs and play for 10 mins.

playstation,3a5q2c,Latinola1,11,Thu Jun 18 02:26:26 2015 UTC,"So basically the reason why the XB1 has BC is because they built a 360 emulator, why can't Sony create a PS3 emulator? (Honest question)"
playstation,3a5q2c,Mortecai,14,Thu Jun 18 12:14:37 2015 UTC,Because the chip and code architecture is a complete nightmare. The PS3 quickly became notorious for being the most difficult console to develop for. Plus the hardware was extremely inefficient so despite being objectively more powerful than the 360 on paper games got pretty much identical builds on both. The problem arises in needing to emulate hardware that powerful with the hardware in the ps4. Honestly it's a miracle Microsoft figured out how to emulate 360 with the hardware in the Xbox one.
playstation,3a5q2c,morrispated2,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:45:35 2015 UTC,Honestly it's a miracle Microsoft figured out how to emulate 360 with the hardware in the Xbox one.   Not really. Emulating PPC on x86 is a known entity.

playstation,3a5q2c,oliyoung,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:41:22 2015 UTC,"In short terms the PS3 has a main CPU (a Power PC chip) and 7 SPEs (effectively very specialized vector processing units), a bus to connect everything together and an nvidia GPU on top of that. The PPC is probably straightforward enough to emulate (the 360 has a PPC and the XO has x64, as does the PS4, so clearly that's the case) but the SPEs are likely going to be rather difficult to emulate correctly (they're very good a crunching large numbers of vectors and you can probably repurpose cores within a GPGPU to process those vectors in lieu of using a SPEs but have unique characteristics that make this really difficult). And then there's the GPU, which is another pain point.  I think it's possible but non trivial to do. With highly parallel systems like the SPEs you're going to have a lot of trouble with keeping the machine states synched up and synchronized and you're going to have a bunch of weird issues that are going to be hard to overcome unless you do it all in software. And a software solution is going to be difficult to do on PS4 hardware."
playstation,3a5q2c,OK6502,-4,Wed Jun 17 19:11:23 2015 UTC,"Because the PS3 architecture is so drastically different to the PS4 architecture, that we're told ""building an emulator"" would be a mammoth investment (that many have speculated could never be 100% functional anyway). Whereas the 360 on the other hand has a fairly similar architecture to the XBone, so it would have been much easier for Microsoft to produce."
playstation,3a5q2c,lolstebbo,2,Wed Jun 17 23:54:27 2015 UTC,"Whereas the 360 on the other hand has a fairly similar architecture to the XBone, so it would have been much easier for Microsoft to produce.   They're not similar at all, but emulating PPC on x86 has been done plenty of times already."
playstation,3a5q2c,Rufffmuff,-2,Wed Jun 17 20:29:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry OP but this is not true. Xbox 360 is essentially an IBM PPC actually very similar in instruction set to the PS4.. Except for the core count in which PS3 has like 7 vs 3 I think for Xbox 360. Regardless, emulation prior to this week for both was seen as a technical impossibility for these ""underpowered"" consoles. Who knew!  I meant PS3 has 7 cores"
playstation,3a5q2c,lolstebbo,5,Wed Jun 17 15:39:15 2015 UTC,"Huh?  The XB1 and PS4 use the same x86 architecture.  The PS3 used a proprietary Cell architecture that, while PPC-based, was a nightmare to develop for and is probably also a nightmare to emulate.  The 360 used a PPC architecture, an architecture that has been emulated on x86 plenty of times smoothly enough. It's nowhere near as impossible as PS3 emulation, but it's not free of clunkiness, either."
playstation,3a5q2c,OK6502,2,Wed Jun 17 18:09:49 2015 UTC,"360 has a PPC, the PS4 uses a generic AMD 64 chip. They're not the same at all. The 360 has no SPEs - it only supports the default vector instruction set of the PPC chip set (the VMX instruction set)."

playstation,3a5q2c,Rufffmuff,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:49:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry but no this is so dumb, the complexity of the cell does not make the architecture of a PPC similar to an x86 chip.."

playstation,3a5q2c,carthroway,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:43:45 2015 UTC,If backward compatibility is that big of a selling point you might as not bother getting a X1 and just stay with 360 & PS3. You could save yourself a lot of money then.
playstation,3a5q2c,triad_spacefight,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:48:31 2015 UTC,The problem is that I'd rather invest $100 in a backwards compatible system than having to buy BOTH. I'll stay with PC master race if Sony can't get their act together.
playstation,3a5q2c,hatmantc,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"All Sony has to do to make me happy is to at least offer the games that I have digitally for the PS3 available at no cost on PS Now.  A few months ago I thought this was the case when I saw Bioshock Infinite on my PS4 dashboard with the Playstation Now logo. It booted up and I played it for a little while. It was a little laggy, so I quit. Noticed my saves and DLC weren't there, but whatever, maybe it's because it's local on my PS3 or something. A week later I was charged $19.99 for a monthly subscription to PS Now, even though I A) played a game I already own AND got for free on PS Plus and B) never consented to a renewing subscription, or was even asked to sign up for a 7 day trial of PS Now. Needless to say, I was quite upset, it felt rather sneaky of Sony to do that.  Point being, they have the capability to push games directly to the PS4 from the last generation with PS Now, so syncing the games that you own digitally with the database of games on PS Now should be a no brainer. I'm fully convinced they won't do it because of all of the ""remasters"" more than anything at this point."

Needless to say, I was quite upset, it felt rather sneaky of Sony to do that.   there had to be some sort of notice/prompt before you started the game that you just ignored."
playstation,3a5q2c,onesugar,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:49:20 2015 UTC,"Nope. Just pressed play and Bioshock started streaming. No notice, no nothing. I found an e-mail that was sent to my Gmail account about a 7 day trial that I missed due to it being marked as a Promotion.  Edit: Either way, the part about Playstation Now charging me things isn't the point I was trying to make with my post. They can already push PS3 games to the PS4 directly with PS Now, so I would imagine it being somewhat trivial to stream you games you already digitally own from last gen since they are listed under your SEN account. They could make the X1 announcement look irrelevant by saying ""hey you can play all of your back catalog for free on Sony TV's, PSTV, PS4, PSV, etc now too"" using tech they already have."

playstation,3a5q2c,hatmantc,-3,Wed Jun 17 20:52:31 2015 UTC,"So much damage control in these comments. Personally, I think having backwards compatibility should be a given. For one thing, the Xbox One is already doing it; why wouldn't Sony want to stay competitive? If the current-gen consoles have architecture similar to what's found in modern gaming PCs, what's stopping Sony from developing an emulator for older software? Having backwards compatibility is also good for the people who may not have the space to hold all of their consoles, or whose consoles are on their last legs. I still have an old George Foreman grill PS3 and I'd personally love to finally put that monolith of a console to rest and free up some shelf space for other things.   It'd be a much better option compared to PlayStation Now, which is complete garbage to me. Why would anyone want to pay $20 a month (on top of their $50/year PS Plus subscription, I might add!) to play older games with copious input lag due to streaming? It's not like it's a permanent solution, either; what's gonna happen when PSNow's servers inevitably get shut down?"
playstation,3a5q2c,SnakesMum93,2,Wed Jun 17 21:04:46 2015 UTC,"why wouldn't Sony want to stay competitive?     because they feel that it's not really that big of a selling point and don't want to waste resources?       If the current-gen consoles have architecture similar to what's found in modern gaming PCs, what's stopping Sony from developing an emulator for older software?     They're trying to push things forward with PS NOW.. which keep in mind is in its infancy. everything is not set in stone yet. so they could offer an option in the future where if you have a game you could just put it into your system, the ps4 recognizes it and allows you to play on PS Now  i was in the beta for a while on PS3, it had its moments when the connection seemed to dip, but it wasn't too bad for the majority of the time"

If you're doing digital, I believe if you buy it off of the Square Enix site basically they will email you a key to register on the PS store for which ever Playstation account you want the game linked to. If you buy it in the PSN store, it will be linked automatically to your account that you're logged in to.   For your niece, you guys can share your PSN account and FFXIV account on different consoles as long as she knows your account and passwords, but obviously can't be logged in at the same time to either the account or PSN account. But I believe you'll have issues resetting your password a lot, usually when you log into different systems with different IP addresses it suspects activity and requires a password change. So basically if you're wanting it separate to play together, you'd have to have a active PSN and FFXIV account. I know there's a special way to somehow have 2 games into one account, so she won't have to have a separate PSN account, and it won't interrupt your characters or anything if that's what you're afraid of. But you can just buy 2 copies digitally or physically and link them I believe, but I'm not sure if you'd have to pay 2 separate subscriptions.   I hope that answered your questions :)!"

playstation,3a2rx2,KILRbuny,0,Wed Jun 17 06:44:07 2015 UTC,I don't think you can safely assume life spans within technology based on passed technology. These consoles are underpowered compared to the jumps those consoles made from one to the other. And computers are only going to get better while these consoles stay the same. So in 4-5 years when 4k is standard on computers these consoles are going to look incredibly weak.   I would imagine possibly one more standard console generation after this one. But then they are going to have to make some sort of change to compete with the power of the PC; especially with how easy PCs are becoming to set up and use.   I would wager that these consoles would not last as long as last gen.

At the very least, we'll be able to play it as a digital release. I personally backed for 100$ and also hope a ps4 physical release will be made available."
playstation,3a43ih,Haynono,6,Wed Jun 17 01:57:44 2015 UTC,"Here's my understanding of E3: Sony did terribly revealing 2 new games, one of which looked more like an art maker than a game, but the truth is that there were a variety of games they did not show off on stage that we know about.  For example where was  Gow 4 Persona 5 Star Ocean Nier  HellBlade (which was revealed in trailer prior to E3) Everyone's gone to the Rapture Ratchet and Clank Rime etc. none of which they showed on stage-   Instead they chose to waste their time giving exposure to Shenmue 3 kick starter, and some exclusive disney infinity figures as well as a few other games that not many are really excited for.   I believe some of those games would have been better left for a commercial or youtube video, specially the Disney Infinity figures seeing everyone watching was most likely over the age of 18, not exactly the demographic of Disney Infinity. Adam Boyes even cursed at the beginning of their time on stage showing that they knew it wasn't a PG showing.  Their biggest mistake was how they labeled Morpheus ""a good choice"" as well as giving it less than three minutes of stage time. This is bad as peripherals have to be pushed and shown as something that everyone must have.  Take Microsoft's HoloLens and Elite Controller for example, both were shown to be these super cool devices but as i see it the only plus side to the elite controller are the extra back buttons and that the buttons are re-mapable, however most games don't have that many controls to warrant the extra buttons. As for the HoloLens it sure looked cool but will that really be how they look and preform? Even if they do preform in such a way how many games will have this functionality and how many of them will be fun to play? The only thing that was done with the HoloLens during the presentation was that the user was able to shoot a lighting bolt and see through blocks which isn't exactly the reason people play Minecraft. The point, however, still stands; Microsoft sold their peripherals as the next big thing while Sony's man stood there and said ""Its a good choice.""  There is much more i can say but ill leave it at that as this comment is rather lengthy as it stands."

playstation,3a43ih,Marcopolio5,0,Wed Jun 17 20:39:54 2015 UTC,"why? mods will  come to ps4 sooner or later, its been confirmed by fallout 4 devs, just like tomb raider will as well."
playstation,3a43ih,swordfiend,2,Thu Jun 18 03:57:02 2015 UTC,"They say they are trying. It's possible that with the Xbone may have it for a year or more before it launches on PS4, if it comes at all. May as well just get it on Xbox"

As someone who dislikes fps games and hates CoD I was even excited by the CoD gameplay that was shown at the Sony conference. I am also really happy Sony didn't waste 30 minutes on their VR. Horizon and Last Guardian are the best thing of E3 2015 imo."

Art style, controls, pacing, replay value. All these things will be judged according to today's standards, but are also tied to nostalgia for so many people, so they can't just throw away everything either.

playstation,3a4izw,Ciocana,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:40:03 2015 UTC,"Depends on the specs of the slim and the storage; id say you should wait for a good bundle for Black Friday or Christmas. Also something should be said concerning your ownership of a ps3 (that is, if you do own one) as one could replace their systems memory from a 500Gig hard drive to a 2 terabyte which then frees up your ps4's old 500gig hard drive to be installed into your PS3."
playstation,3a4izw,RaptureNoah,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:43:06 2015 UTC,I'm just wondering if the specs are going to change by a lot like how the power from the original PS3 had a decent upgrade to the PS3 slim.
playstation,3a4izw,NoTFTLight,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:38:20 2015 UTC,"Probably wont change much, PS4 hard drive is also VERY VERY easy to replace so I dont even see a major HD upgrade coming. Also ps2 slim took 4 years to come out, ps3 slim took 3. Neither slim versions had any hardware upgrades worth mentioning, so are you going to wait another 2 years to buy the ps4 slim? Which to be perfectly honest I am not sure will be coming, Sony was pretty on point this time around."
playstation,3a4izw,Redheadkitten,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:51:33 2015 UTC,"Either way, wait for a price drop around the holidays.   I was going to wait for a slim version myself, but I was given one last Christmas as a gift. Looking at past releases, it seems to take about 3-4 years for the slim version to come out, so you're looking at late 2016 at the earliest I'd think."

This is the fundamental difference between Sony and Microsoft's offering, in my opinion, and i don't feel like Sony has any ""catching up"" to do. They're apples and oranges."
playstation,39zcrx,rinwashere,6,Tue Jun 16 14:36:32 2015 UTC,Except there is no fee associated with what Microsoft is doing also no lag when playing the game.
playstation,39zcrx,takedownchris,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:13:08 2015 UTC,"And you're limited to whatever disc you can get your hands on on the xbox360.  Which is why I'm saying, for me, I'm paying for games I haven't played, not games I already have."
playstation,39zcrx,rinwashere,5,Tue Jun 16 15:34:12 2015 UTC,"It's not disc only. Digital content also works. So if you can't find the disk, that's not really an issue. It also, incidentally, applies to game rentals since disc scenarios are supported. So this could apply to games you don't have.  Where streaming gets interesting is in scenarios where you don't have access to a TV and/or a console, say via a thin client (like a tablet or even a phone, assuming you can plug in some kind of controller to it). Streaming is cool because it makes the hardware irrelevant. Streaming blows because it depends entirely on your network capabilities. So there are tradeoffs."
playstation,39zcrx,OK6502,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:39:40 2015 UTC,"digital and rental works   From what I understand, xbone isn't promising full backwards compatibility. It's going to be rolled out bits and pieces, and publishers of the old games will probably have to sign some agreement.   In this respect, this is almost the same as PSNow. Sony can't randomly add titles to PSN or PSNow, and neither can Microsoft randomly add titles to backwards compatibility. They need permission.   So you may have bought your game digitally, or have it rented, but that in itself is not a guarantee that it will be supported. Backwards compatibility for titles we want is beyond our control in both cases.   where streaming gets interesting [...] makes hardware irrelevant (but) it depends entirely on your network capabilites   The second challenge with Microsoft's approach is that it's most likely an emulator approach. Xbox360 is a power-pc based CPU. Xbone is an x86 processor.  There will be a certain amount of translation of instructions, and that's never perfect. The best way to emulate things is to throw as much CPU and memory at it as we can. That's why we can nail Gameboy emulation, because our processors outclass it so much, we don't mind spending 10 cycles to translate a 1 cycle instruction. We'll still make it back in time.   At this point in the game, we can't upgrade the xbone or the ps4 to be any faster. But internet speed is something we can upgrade, not just for gaming, but for other things too.   What's really excitinf is that Xbox can now stream to any Windows 10 PC, which is pretty cool as well. PC penetration is definitely higher than Vita/VitaTV/smart TVs combined (but maybe not Win10). So we'll see how well consumers take that news."
playstation,39zcrx,rinwashere,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:06:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, it should go without saying that this applies to supported games. I was commenting on the tech, not whether or not Sony/Microsoft can hash out an agreement with various studios. So to be clear: assuming the game in question has a disc version and is supported by back compat and is carried by your local game rental shop you can play the game on the console without purchasing it.   I do know how to emulate games. I've actually written various emulators. But I'm not sure your point is. Largely it's irrelevant how Microsoft is doing it - all that matters is that they are with the current hardware. So Xbox back compat, realistically, comes down to owning an Xbox One and a supported title. For the sake of comparison in order to use PS Now you need a supported device ( PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation TV, select Sony TVs, select Sony Blu-ray Players, and select Samsung Smart TVs), you have to pay for the service and you have to have a decent internet connection (granted, to download the Xbox One back compat title you're probably going to need a decent enough connection and a decent bandwidth cap but that's a one time thing. If you're really stuck you can copy it over to an external HDD from somewhere else and then copy the bits over to your console).   They're different services, and they have different advantages, but the barrier for entry is higher for PS Now than it is for the Xbox. That's not to say that will always be the case as Sony may figure out a way to provide the service at lower cost (assuming they figure out how to deal with equipment, power and bandwidth costs) but at current that's the case. As you pointed out Windows PC penetration is much higher than any console base. If Sony came out with a PC client they'd increase their client base by orders of magnitude. It seems that right now they're limiting access to the service in order to encourage adoption of their own hardware. That's fine, it's a valid business strategy but one I believe to be short sighted."
playstation,39zcrx,OK6502,2,Wed Jun 17 20:17:43 2015 UTC,You could probably find those disc for cheaper than what ps now is offering .
playstation,39zcrx,themightyfludd,2,Tue Jun 16 17:29:53 2015 UTC,"PSNow library has (supposedly) over 200 titles. Let's say I wouldn't play half of them, like I get motion sickness playing first person shooters. So let's pretend it's100 titles.  $15/month for a year is around $180/year. Divided among 100 games is around $1.8/year for each game. Even 3 years it'll only be for $5.4/game, and that's excluding new titles that get added.  Do I really want to play game xxx? Yes. Do I want to spend $5-10 on the game to find out I don't like it? No.   It's a different offering with different metrics. Microsoft is ""rewarding"" you for keeping old games. Sony is ""inticing"" you to try new games. What you get out of it is up to you."
playstation,39zcrx,rinwashere,0,Tue Jun 16 17:45:58 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't work, so many people would let their friends borrow their game discs and have everyone get the games for free."
playstation,39zcrx,RedVsBlue209,7,Tue Jun 16 00:40:28 2015 UTC,They could just have a check for the disc so you'd have to put it in every time you wanted to play it (just like if it were natively compatible)
playstation,39zcrx,fco83,3,Tue Jun 16 03:09:57 2015 UTC,"I mean to have access to the game through PSNOW as long as you have the disc. As in since the PS4 technically recognizes the PS3 disc, but is unable and will refuse to play it's content. XBO will allow players who own theor 360 games to download a digital copy of the game, and play it'll it as long as the disc is still in the console.    Why not just do the same premise, aside from actualltly downloading the game. Put your disc in, PS4 will recognize the disc, and unlock the game to stream for free on PSNow, as long as you have the game disc."
playstation,39zcrx,Rikarour,-2,Tue Jun 16 00:47:37 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that what X1 meant was that anyone who bought them digitally. For example if they bought GTA San Andreas via the Store and not disc. The disc thing wouldn't work unless they block the disc from every being used again...

playstation,39zpdm,SteppingSplash,-1,Tue Jun 16 03:11:32 2015 UTC,You can't just issue a software update to be able to use CDs if the hardware doesn't support it.
playstation,39zpdm,TGTX,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:03:30 2015 UTC,"PS4 plays DVDs just fine. The hardware is there. It literally is almost a flick of a switch to make it happen. Sony recognized the no CD support last year, hopefully it's still on the roadmap. http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/sony-remembers-ps4-will-play-cds-and-mp3s-after-update-1199081  I really enjoyed the ability to rip audio CDs on my PS3 and then have the songs available for a custom in-game soundtrack. I really want some type of lossless music playback option though."

playstation,39zrek,Brad3000,3,Tue Jun 16 13:25:08 2015 UTC,"It IS actually a gamble. It's a 15 year old game that sold poorly on a dying console. Just because the fans have been vocal about their desire for a sequel for those entire 15 years, doesn't mean the game is a financially sound in way.   I'm saying this as a HUGE Shenmue fan. I played an import copy of Shenmue 2 on my Dreamcast and it was my favorite game of all time for many years."

playstation,39xm72,greenejs,3,Mon Jun 15 19:34:51 2015 UTC,"What it boils down to is the PS4 would need to emulate the preceding consoles for backwards compatibility. The XB1 emulating the 360 doesn't mean that the PS4 can emulate the PS3; Cell may be derived from PowerPC, but the actual code execution may be different enough (I have no clue)."
playstation,39xm72,lolstebbo,-1,Mon Jun 15 19:59:57 2015 UTC,The Xbox 360 wasn't x86 either so if M$ managed to resolve the architectural incompatibility via software (reminds me of Bleem from the early 00s) then I don't see why Sony can't jump on that wagon.
playstation,39xm72,Skulltrail,4,Mon Jun 15 20:30:18 2015 UTC,Microsoft recompiles the binary for the game before you can play it.  (This is why they have to download the gave from the server even if you have a disk)  Sony should just have free PS Now on games you own for pseudo-Backwards Compatibility.
playstation,39xm72,aidotato5,3,Mon Jun 15 23:00:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I would even be willing to send in my PS3 discs to Sony if they let me play them all on my PS4."
playstation,39xm72,DrTiggles,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:53:13 2015 UTC,I guess it depends on the strength of the hardware. It would all be emulation so who knows.

playstation,39xm72,Skulltrail,-2,Mon Jun 15 20:56:48 2015 UTC,"Ps3 should work effortlessly vs 1 and 2. That's why the ps3 had a hard time playing the old ones, even the old 60 gig had issues. Ps3 is Blu Ray based like ps4 so it most likely shouldn't break a sweat, though the ps3 was a complicated when it came to making games. Not sure if that would make a difference or not."
playstation,39xm72,EmutheFoo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:22:49 2015 UTC,Blu-Ray is the least of the backwards-compatibility concerns. It's executing the instructions for the Cell architecture through emulation that would be the issue.
playstation,39xm72,lolstebbo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:51:36 2015 UTC,"The blu-ray has nothing to do with anything, a blu-ray player cab read a dvd just aswell, the problem is that the architecture of the PS4 is so different from the weirdly complicated PS3, now the X1 and the 360 also have different architectures, the 360 being a powerPC and the One being a ""normal"" x86, but it's not  AS different, I'm hoping, but not so sure, that sony can pull this off"

playstation,39xm72,haydar1994,5,Mon Jun 15 18:07:07 2015 UTC,This is a huge slap in the face by MS.  Sony better step your fucking game up.
playstation,39xm72,FF13LightningReturns,3,Mon Jun 15 20:44:16 2015 UTC,"This is a double edged sword from the MS camp IMO. Them just saying ""hey it's backwards compatible now"" is super shady.   It makes you think they could've done it at any time and that they deliberately chose not to. It's probably going to give them a huge boost in sales, but I hope it kind of diminishes their public image too because that's some greedy bullshit because the hardware was capable of it the whole time."
playstation,39xm72,YepImanEmokid,2,Tue Jun 16 04:40:26 2015 UTC,So MS is greedy because they held off on emulation but Sony isnt for charging people 20 bucks a month for games they already own?
playstation,39xm72,loki993,2,Tue Jun 16 15:07:33 2015 UTC,"I think MS is on the right track with implementation, but just randomly turning it on is the wrong way to go about it. Sony's having it in some capacity since launch was a better marketing strategy, but is a shittier way to go about the problem (by making it a paid service.) If that makes sense."
playstation,39xm72,YepImanEmokid,2,Tue Jun 16 17:50:37 2015 UTC,I get what your saying.

I call you a fucking retard.  sony refuse to make it happen, why? because money. They upres last gen games and repackage it as ""HD Remaster"" then sell you at the full retail price. better yet, you wanna play the old titles you already own? you can use our premium ""playstation now"" service for only $19.99 a month. only works if you have high speed internet service. if your ISP is down, then you are shit out of luck. fuck that bullshit.  PS: one of the earliest playstation emulator (Connectix Virtual Game Station) was capable of fully emulating playstation on computers rough 7 times stronger than playstation console."
playstation,39xm72,FF13LightningReturns,2,Tue Jun 16 04:54:40 2015 UTC,I don't think you understand how emulation works.
playstation,39xm72,alex25400,-1,Tue Jun 16 14:35:57 2015 UTC,I don't think you know how emulation works.
playstation,39xm72,FF13LightningReturns,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:40:58 2015 UTC,Do you know what architecture is?
playstation,39xm72,alex25400,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:39:27 2015 UTC,"computer architecture is a set of disciplines that describe the functionality, organization and implementation of computer systems. Most emulators just emulate a hardware architecture—if operating system firmware or software is required for the desired software, it must be provided as well (and may itself be emulated). Both the OS and the software will then be interpreted by the emulator, rather than being run by native hardware.  you think sony does not know their own product's architecture? obvious troll is obvious. and what do you know about emulation?"
playstation,39xm72,FF13LightningReturns,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:10:40 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree, but the uneducated masses probably wouldn't know that.

playstation,39xm72,YepImanEmokid,9,Tue Jun 16 13:40:07 2015 UTC,"Do most people keep their old games after moving to the next-gen?   I had a massive PS2 library and only played a game once on my PS3 -  ""Oh that's neat."" and never again.   I sold all my PS3 games when I got my PS4. It's great for XBox fans if that's something the players want, but it's not a game changer for me.   PSNow is great because it's games that you probably didn't play before,  but our Internet in Manitoba is the shits."

They are all permanent investments and I shall own it forever. Because in that one week after i sold quite a few of my game I cannot count the amount of times I had the feeling ""Ohh maybe i should play this.....oh crap i sold that back.....and damn i still have this dlc for it..."" luckily that was only midway through the 360's life so I have since then built my collection back up but all of my 360 and ps3 games are going to stay with me forever and eventually will be seen/played by my offspring. quite a few games are timeless and will stay that way no matter how many new console generations there are and I want a record of all the fun times I've had."
playstation,39xm72,astickywhale,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:05:50 2015 UTC,It's funny. When I was growing up with my genesis and snes my mom always made me hold onto my games. Im so thankful she made me do that. I can't imagine trying to hunt down some of this stuff.
playstation,39xm72,_heisenberg__,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:45:20 2015 UTC,"What is the sense in keeping something that you know you will likely never touch for the rest of your life?  I only collect from series that I regularly play or am particularly fond of, such as Armored Core and Disgaea. Everything else gets traded off or sold to make space for new titles and to recoup a small amount of value on top of the enjoyment I received from playing them.   In my view, if an item doesn't have any utility or special value to me, I'm not going to be inclined to hold onto it.   If others find that hanging onto things like video games is worth a few dollars in the long run then that is quite alright. It just depends on what you value."
playstation,39xm72,_Slate,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:09:20 2015 UTC,"You're right. Most of the time I give away the games that I know I am not going to play because I feel like giving them to someone else that I know will play them is more valuable to me than giving them to a company so they can rot in their little drawers behind the counter until they throw them away. For me I also have my PS3, PS2, and Xbox in my bedroom, so on a lazy Sunday sometimes I will pop in an old game and lay in bed and play it. So all those games are still valuable to me...to each their own I guess."
playstation,39xm72,jarpua,2,Tue Jun 16 08:10:51 2015 UTC,Fuck yes people keep playing their old games. Being able to play them on current gen consoles is even better.

So it's not exactly true backwards compatibility, it more like you can use your old 360 disks as download vouchers.

playstation,39y1f7,Ent_Doran,2,Mon Jun 15 20:30:34 2015 UTC,"Straight up amazon. Don't even fuck with looking at Gamestop. You'd have to buy a whole new, used controller to open up to salvage the sticks from and at that point you'd have a new controller anyways. It sounds like you actually need to replace the entire analog stick. Here's what I recommend. Go on Amazon, buy this ( http://www.amazon.com/Pairs-Thumbstick-analog-Controller-Playstation-3/dp/B00IYPIK14), open that puppy up (The controller, not the dog), and throw a fresh new pair of sticks in that baby (again, not a real baby, your controller). You'll fall in love with the freshness of those sticks and even have a replacement set for when that puppy chews them up again, or when you decide to chew them up again, you know, not passing any judgement."

I get about 25 ish frames per second on the home screen (the ps4 one) but is smooth while streaming YouTube from one to the other. It's an acceptable one for both running on WiFi.   My router came with an antenna so I couldn't tell you the difference personally.  In the case of remote playing the ps4, the controller connects to the VitaTV and is independent of the ps4.   I don't think so but to be honest I looked at the app list once about a month ago when I got mine didn't get anything and never looked again. I'm pretty sure it's not though."

playstation,39t34a,spankadoodle,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:14:24 2015 UTC,"I was thinking you were asking what would happen to the PS3 games on your PS3 once PS+ stopped supporting the PS3. If they end up getting removed, you would have to buy them to play them.... by the time PS+ stops supporting PS3, these games will be so old that you can find them for probably <$5 a piece. I forgot it was a yearly charge, I cancelled my subscription a while ago, I'm just going to play the games I own until I subscribe again when I get a PS4. But still, I doubt they will stop supporting the PS3 for a while, and when they do, these games will be so cheap you can get them used if you want for probably under $50. Unless you want every single one they've offered, that might still be above $50... but still."
playstation,39t34a,Skitzophraniac,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:07:43 2015 UTC,"That's a great point, especially if it takes a long time for PS+ to stop being supported on the PS3.  Of course, you can probably get around that if you know it's coming. Disconnect the PS3 from the network before the final update that disables PS+ support, note your current PS+ expiration date, and keep the system date to before then. So long as you never connect it to the internet, things should work normally.  EDIT: Also, some of the games have no physical copies, so they would be lost forever if you don't purchase them before PS Store support for the PS3 ends."
playstation,39t34a,halo_nothing,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:28:01 2015 UTC,"In reality though, I am guessing they will offer some sort of discount or even a free pass to keep what you have for being a loyal member. That would be the best situation:) Other than them keeping the support indefinite, or making the PS4 backwards compatible with everything like it should be in the first place -_-"
playstation,39t34a,Skitzophraniac,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:43:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not huge on backwards compatibility, and I'm glad they didn't try to do it for the PS4. There isn't a good way to do it with an architecture change like this. You either end up with emulation, which isn't going to work well and isn't processor efficient, leading to poor performance, or trying to stay with the same architecture, which would be terrible.  You could try to do something like the original PS3 did, by putting in basically both architectures, but that puts a strain on their already thin margins and probably makes it untenable at its current price point.  That being said, I think there's a very good chance the PS5 will be backwards compatible. The PS4 is using an x86 architecture, which has been more or less the standard for the past 15 years and isn't going to go away any time soon. Assuming the PS5 is also x86 based, it won't be hard to make it play PS4 games. It's the same reason you can load a game from 2000 and play it on modern hardware with relatively few issues."
playstation,39t34a,halo_nothing,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:38:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess that makes sense. I just know I plan on playing PS1,2, and 3 games continually throughout the rest of my gaming life. I don't like that I will have to keep buying new consoles throughout more generations. But I guess there's always a closet I could retire a console for if it will be a while. But what I do know, is if I was a 360 gamer and I was hesitating moving to a xbone, I would definitely be moving there with their recently announced backwards compatibility."
playstation,39t34a,Skitzophraniac,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:15:15 2015 UTC,"Actually, it would be fairly easy with Playstation Now.  Insert disc, the PS4 reads the catalogue number off the disc, game begins streaming on PS Now.  Done."

With 5 games, 4 controllers and a 2 controller charging dock it ended up at a total of $97 in store. Not great, but then I bought a used ps4 that came with Assassin's creed unity free (the deal was a used game under $30), a controller and all the necessary wires, for $350. So in the end I shoveled out around $250 for a base system and one game of choice. Still pricy, but I wanted it, the ps3 is basically  dead and my friends moved on. While I could have waited 4 years or so for a slim version and the price of a used fat to fall, my ps3 would have lost value DRAMATICALLY.   IN SHORT: If you don't have a system to sell for in store credit at gamestop and really want it now, buy off Amazon or  Ebay. But if you are very patient and don't have a system to sell. Wait for the slim version to release and buy a used fat off Amazon (system lifespan is 4-5 years from that point)"

That's not enough of an excuse to cripple the system with a shitty proprietary memory card. It sounds great to publishers and devs because Sony can say, ""hey they can't hack this thing easy"". They just forgot that when they make a very specific memory for only one device that it's going to coast them money. Even the PSP used cards that were useful with cameras. The memory cards are a true detriment to the console. The best solution would be to add system memory with the ability to increase storage. If my 3 year old phone has 32 gigs of system storage then a device dedicated to gaming should easily match that. The thing is, I don't want to carry a bunch of games with me. I want to have a library of games at the ready, installed and ready to go. They give you enough incentive with PS Plus which gives you at least 1 free Vita game but what's the point if I can't store it. I gotta delete one if my favorite games to fit a small indie game? No! The Vita isn't cheap, even at $200. The best deal is the Borderlands 2 bundle which comes with a 8 gb card. Borderlands 2 is a download so that's space on that card. You can put a few indie games or like 2-4 larger games on there before you have to drop a bunch of money to expand. Not to mention you'll loose all your saves unless you back them up to the cloud because your account it tide to the memory card. So you can't even effectively keep your old card if you choose to upgrade because you'd need to wipe your system every time you use a new card... It's the worst thing about it.   The worst.  Sorry... I ranted."

Ditch the game cart slot and put two triggers on the back, 128GB internal storage (steal some flash memory from the Walkman division). Maybe put 64GB internal and Micro SD too.   It should come with at least a years PS+ and should be available in a few, maybe 5 different bundles to cater for age and game genre. Kids one could come with Minecraft and some other kid friendly things, sports one could come with Fifa/MLB/NFL whatever, you could have a more grown up one with Telltale games and more thought provoking indies and whatever exclusives fit the bill.

If the games that they designed the system to play are no longer being made it is a bad sign.   There are still ports of PS3 games, as well as AAA Vita exclusives, being made in Japan. A big part of the 3DS's selling points was its ability to process GCN-level graphics - look at the launch titles for it: Kid Icarus Uprising, Pilotwings, Ocarina of Time 3D, Ridge Racer, Samurai Warriors, Street Fighter IV, all had graphics as selling points.

If we go by quality games the 3DS is far in the lead for most buyers based on 1st party alone.   The barrier of entry for Android and iOS is much lower than 3DS/PSV. They're not comparable. Both PSV and 3DS require a significant amount of financial investment. The fact that they're still getting made shows they're profitable, the fact that more are made for the Vita than 3DS shows that the Vita is a strong platform in Asia. If 1st party games alone could carry a system, Wii U would dominate over PS4/XB1.   Because it died a long time ago in the west. Sony is not the best organization but they are more competent allocating advertising dollars than most redditors.   Yup, Sony knew that the Vita was going to die within a week of its release. That's why they never bothered to market it even from day one. They only released it at all in the West because of their infernal contract with the Old God Nyarlat-Hotep, who's a big fan of Wipeout and Killzone."

playstation,39nphl,TheNewColor,3,Sat Jun 13 01:38:20 2015 UTC,"You may be better off breaking it up and selling everything separately than to sell it as a bundle. DO NOT SELL YOUR GAMES AT GAMESTOP! Unless it's a last resort, I was able to sell multiple PS4 games for 2-5x what GameStop was offering on EBay, including the price of shipping. This is likely your best bet for games, especially newer ones like Witcher.  As for the console, there is so much competition with pricing, that you would likely be better off selling it locally (Craigslist or a local shop). EBay will take about 15-20% in fees, as well as shipping costs. Compare this price to what GameStop offers, and see what you think. I personally think the best bet would be Craigslist, but this is highly dependent on whether you live somewhere urban-ish, otherwise there may not be much of a market.  An EBay tip: look at the ""completed listings"" rather than active listings in order to get a feel what things are actually selling for. If the average price is $19.99, list yours for 18.99. Almost every time, I get multiple people bidding, and the final price ends up above the average."

playstation,39kp5m,pizzapunt55,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:03:17 2015 UTC,No. This will not work. Amazon normally will sell controllers much cheaper than retailers ($45 vs $59). So check that out if you need a second controller.
playstation,39kp5m,jaytomten,-1,Fri Jun 12 12:23:16 2015 UTC,"Well... that's a bummer. Why do I need a new controller when I'm used to this one. Well, I gues I'll go back to pc gaming. I can atleast use the controller of my choice."
playstation,39kp5m,Aganiel,2,Fri Jun 12 12:38:09 2015 UTC,"Thing is, you're asking to hook something up to a console of its competition. Vice versa doesn't work either.  When you buy the PS4 you'll get a controller with it, and getting used to it is pretty easy. There's a significant difference but it's easy to use. Shouldn't stop you."
playstation,39kp5m,Numbah8,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:42:03 2015 UTC,But this what I don't get. Why do I have to get used to something when I have something that already works. Why do I have to change for the machine I want to buy instead of otherwise. I just find that very odd.
playstation,39kp5m,Numbah8,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:02:30 2015 UTC,"I think the best answer is competition..the console race is extremely competitive especially between Microsoft and Sony and I don't see why they'd allow you to use the other's cobtroller. I'm sure somewhere down the line, there will be third party adapters for your 360 controllers of it hasn't already been made.  I had one back in the day that allowed me to plug my PS2 controller into an Xbox or gamecube.  You also gotta realize that some games are made specifically with the controller in mind.  The PS4'S TouchPad is probably the biggest difference and many games use it in various ways.  These company's aren't all that bad though.  If you had a PS3, it's very easy to plug your PS4 controller into it."
playstation,39kp5m,Aganiel,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:25:45 2015 UTC,"Competition you say. So if their machine would give the abillity to use whichever controller I want, I would not buy their machine? Also, is it true that I can't use my PS3 games on a PS4, because that would be the nail in the coffin for me."

playstation,39dl6b,makled,2,Thu Jun 11 01:22:24 2015 UTC,"this is a major problem for many players around the world that Sony is obviously ignoring. I have the same problem, it occured TWICE this month.  SERVERS ARE NOT DOWN !  I have been succesfully logged in and played on-line (Final Fantasy 14) via my cell phone data for past 2 weeks, but I can't log in via my wifi router (different ISP, different IP adress).  so what's the problem?  Sony, although pretending it is not true, have an anti-DDoS system run by Prolexic (check their web, it is even stated that ""Playstation"" (sic.) is among their clients) and they are blocking IPs based on some weird rule. I have never run a DDoS attack, my system is clean of viruses/troyans/spambots (Norton Internet Security full version with active firewall, quick scan every wednesday, full scan 1st day in month) yet my IP is blacklisted.  I tracerouted my traffic when logging in to PSN on computer and the session is stopped by a proxy called unknown.prolexic.com, which is the anti-DDoS-er.  I have the same problem - my ISP gives a variable IP and there is no way to change it unless I will buy a new modem (yay!) or pay for static IP (even bigger yay!).  I have checked blocked ports - none is used by PSN, so my ISP is in no way restricting my access to PSN.  My flatmate wrote to local AND global PSN TechSupport. The first one is ignoring him, the second one sent an auto-reply message.  On official forums Sony is either silent or claiming problem is not on their side.  check if you are blocked by prolexic, too. then contact your local PSN support. I guess without spamming their forums and tech support they will not act or at least ANSWER...  (sorry for grammar/spelling mistakes, I'm not a native speaker)"

I've owned a PS4 since launch and currently it's just been a glorified Netflix machine.  You've only had the PS3 for about a year?

playstation,398puw,Credix,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:56:52 2015 UTC,"Have you tried resetting your modem? If not, completely power off your modem, wait a good 60 seconds, and then power it back on. If that doesn't work, is your PS4 connected on WiFi or by a cable? If WiFi, try cable and see if it's doing the same thing. If it's now fixed, something else could be interfering with your WiFi signal. Is it worse at certain times of the day? Have you had new neighbours move in? Have you bought any new wireless devices recently? True story: I found out recently that our new baby monitor causes our download speed to drop massively for any device that's near the camera unit.   Another option might be to try different internet connection settings on your PS4. I think there's an option to reset them to default, so start with that and then change each setting one by one to see if anything affects the performance. Also get the Speedtest.net app on your phone and check your internet speed while your PS4 is lagging. If it reports that your speed is low or your Ping is high whenever your PS4 is having problems, it could mean that the problem isn't related to your PS4."

The Crew is more varied and has a lot of interesting events to take up your time, as well as more of a story/varied styles of racing (Dirt, etc.) but ultimately falls short once you hit Circuit. I personally like NFSR more, but I'll eventually go back to The Crew."

playstation,391j16,Weekend-Warrior,4,Mon Jun 8 15:58:34 2015 UTC,"Had your exact same situation.  Sadly, simply popping the HDD in a new PS4 won't cut it. You'll be asked to install an update through usb and everything will be wiped. The only way is to replace the hdmi port which is mighty expensive.  If you want to get your saved data back but you haven't uploaded the data to cloud, you can do what I did.  You're going to want to get a usb stick and attempt to transfer the save data through settings. Of course problem is you can't actually see what you're doing since the HDMI port is broken. So what I did is get a working PS4 and use that as a reference to navigate through the settings.  Sure you'll have to guess the time it takes to transfer the data and you won't know what game data you're transferring but it's the better than losing it all."

You can't go back and get previous games for free from past months, unless you had already downloaded them while yours PS+ subscription was active.   First Light, for example, was free earlier this year, but if you were start your subscription today for the first time you would be unable to get FL for free. But if you had an active subscription, say from December 2014, and downloaded FL free on PS+ and later deleted it from your system, you can download it again for free at anytime later on (again, so long as your subscription is active).

If you ever forget your fake UK account's password or email-adresse (for example if you get a new console), those games are gone for good. Same if the subscription runs out and you then purchase a new PS+ subscription on your main US account - you will always need that UK account and if you want to keep the free PS+ games you got through it, you'll have to keep purchasing UK subscriptions..

playstation,38sah8,DBBGBA,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:38:57 2015 UTC,"yeah. i bought a vita pretty recently (knowing full well that they're not making games for it anymore, etc.) and i'm pretty happy with it.  i mostly use it for classics and the more indie games, which personally i just don't really want to play on my PS4, and for remote play, which works pretty well even over wifi when i've got some downtime at work.  so, it's up to how you like to play mostly - if you want something to sit down in front of or if you want something you can take with you. ultimately, if you're going to be getting a PS4 and you want something now, though, i'd go Vita."
playstation,38sah8,3MTA3-DJ,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:44:02 2015 UTC,"The PS TV was a disappointment for me. It only plays a subset of PS Vita games and they're not really clear about which ones will work until you download them.  If you really only want PS1 games, it should work with most, but it'll be fairly limiting otherwise.  The Vita is a better system, but at $40 for the PS TV (at best buy, or if you can get another store to price match since most best buys are sold out) for what you want to do, it could be a good choice."

playstation,38sbvi,Tobsesan,0,Sat Jun 6 11:30:51 2015 UTC,"First, trophies are better.  Second, Ps1, Ps2, early Ps3, and PSP games do not have trophies.  Lastly, Sony did file a patent a few years ago to retroactively implement a trophy system for games that didn't natively support them. Nothing has come of it yet, but perhaps they are still working on something."
playstation,38sbvi,al_ien5000,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:59:53 2015 UTC,"As a owner of all PS3/PS4 and 360 owner, I have to give the edge to Xbox achievements.  Playstation just categorizes achievements into 4(mainly 3) awardable trophies where as Xbox allows developers to set achievements as low as 1 point so achievements can truly be rated.  I had a laugh playing Borderlands DLC when I got a 1 point achievement for passing the first stage of a boss fight and then got the other 49 points after beating the boss.  You can't do that with trophies."
playstation,38sbvi,zaqple,-5,Sun Jun 7 15:11:13 2015 UTC,Ok so i will have to wait for this. I really like the Xbox system waaayy more. It came out years before the playstation one did and really the point system and how you can look up/snap your achievements is way better on xbox.
playstation,38sbvi,_MrBubbles,2,Sat Jun 6 13:05:25 2015 UTC,"Did they change much from Xbox 360 achievements to XBoxOne?   If not, I can say (for me) trophies feel better on PlayStation.   You level up (which does nothing, but it feels awesome to level your account and not just have a bazillion points). And with the specific icons for the trophies, it gets a nice touch.   (edit: had a Xbox 360 for 8 years but switched to ps3 (and now ps4) because the box died)"

playstation,38o71q,FPardo93,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:58:37 2015 UTC,"Well for some reason it is working now, however with some oddball events. I called in to Sony, and holy cow I got reliable help. However I don't know if it's coincidence. Here's what happened.  1) turn off console and turn off modem and or router. 2) leave it as is for no less than 5 mins 3) turn on router/modem 4) may take a bit longer to reset. I say wait another 5 mins. 5) turn on console 6) try Internet test again. If it fails try next step 7) go to settings. And I think it's the second option but try to manually sign into PSN 8) oddball: it said my sign in id or password was incorrect which was not true. 9) if this happens to you use a computer to reset password for PSN 10) wait 5 mins (yes again) 11) try manual sign in again  This are the steps I went through and now it's workin on all devices including my phone app.  If you don't get to the alert that your password is not correct maybe try to reset it still?  Anyways, the rep was humble enough to appear he didn't know what happened however postulated that the mix of high traffic and my multiple attempts to trouble shoot on my own may have placed restrictions on my account. They have logs of tests, if and DNS was changed, ports updated...I just hope now it stays this way...."

playstation,38mp0o,Richard70nl,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:06:54 2015 UTC,"You know what, I've had a similar problem, and found the worst possible solution :(. I had an old Arris3 cable modem for years (DOCSIS 2.0), and finally last month, Comcast finally convinced me to upgrade to a DOCSIS 3.0 modem, namely by leasing one of theirs (mistake #1). The modem they sent me has its own wifi, etc, built in, and sure enough, my PS4 can't seem to connect to PSN through it. I tried hacking the modem a little bit (not much in the way of configuration or things you can/cannot turn off on it unfortunately), but alas no luck. I finally managed to confirm that even though my PS4 could connect to the modem wifi, it seemed like the modem just ignored any other data packets that my PS4 tried to send out. Unfortunately, the modem is located too far away from my PS4 to use a wired connection, but I did have an old Linksys DDWRT-54g wireless router sitting around (and yes, before anyone asks, I did flash it to run OpenWRT, not DD-WRT), and sure enough, if I plug THAT into the new comcast modem, my PS4 can connect to it and gets on PSN just fine, with one exception I'm still trying to figure out -- Once I turn my PS4 off, after about 2-3 hours, the new comcast modem stops talking to the WRT54g (even though its physically plugged into it via a 3.5' cat6), and won't let ANY traffic through until I actually physically disconnect and reconnect it (my suspicion is some kind of stupid auto mac-address filtering or other such nonsense). Alas, I've been too busy to call up Comcast and have a conversation with them about this, but obviously, I intend to send their garbage modem back to them and I'll just shell out for my own new Docsis 3.0 modem, I have a feeling that will fix the problem with some more permanence.  Edit: Amending this topic, I should add that with OTHER wireless devices like my phone or a tablet, I can similarly connect to the wifi of the modem, but visiting for instance us.plastation.com is either unacceptably lagged and slow, or does not load altogether, while other services like Facebook work fine. Netflix does not work from any device connecting to the modem's built in wifi, however it will work if the device connects to my wrt54g instead, so it seems like comcast has specifically filtered the wifi for certain specific services like psn and netflix. If I ever get a good chance to accuse them, I'll update this post to let everyone know their response."

I tried this and ended up breaking one of the plastic pieces. You can buy a replacement disk drive, but when I tried, I had no luck.  Apparently a lot of the drives you can buy on ebay, etc., are defective.  I just broke down and bought a used ps3 to replace mine and have my other one as a netflix machine in another room."
playstation,38f6sz,NekoSennin,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:39:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. Did you have any trouble taking it apart, if that's what you did?"
playstation,38f6sz,ArmyAg08,2,Wed Jun 3 20:42:42 2015 UTC,"Hope /u/tyy365 doesn't mind me butting in, however taking apart a ps3 is relatively easy. Although I'd highly recommend having a youtube disassembly video playing while you take it apart.   Changing the entire disk drive would not take much effort either, but it's probably more expensive that switching out the diodes. Changing the diodes does appear to be much harder though."
playstation,38f6sz,gkoomen,3,Wed Jun 3 21:38:44 2015 UTC,Replacing the lens isn't all that difficult either. I had the blu-ray lens go out on my slim a few years ago and replaced just that very easily for only a few bucks.

playstation,38f6sz,pizzapunt55,2,Wed Jun 3 21:31:39 2015 UTC,I took very good care of my PS3. Never even broke when I gave it sponge baths.
playstation,38dcqh,DreadNot_Z,2,Wed Jun 3 14:09:57 2015 UTC,Personally I want a PS4 that ditches the DVD/BluRay drive and has a ton of internal storage. I never use physical media and I'm sure they could make the PS4 even smaller.
playstation,38dcqh,Khyrdantai,6,Wed Jun 3 19:27:22 2015 UTC,Go get a 4tb drive and pop it in there!
playstation,38dcqh,Klowner,2,Wed Jun 3 19:57:08 2015 UTC,Already threw in a 1TB drive and still have plenty of space. Just dreaming a bit about the PS4-Slim or PS4-2000 or whatever~
playstation,38dcqh,Khyrdantai,2,Wed Jun 3 20:27:51 2015 UTC,I think that should be an option. I live in a rural area and Internet is not fast. Or uncapped. They should make two models. One with a disk drive and one without.
playstation,38dcqh,ElectricBlitz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:06:44 2015 UTC,I definitely think they should stick with a model that uses disks for this generation at the very least!   Kind of like the PSP and PSPGO.   Eventually consoles won't have disk drives. Maybe they'll have a physical media solution similar to what the PSVita uses.
playstation,38dcqh,Khyrdantai,2,Wed Jun 3 21:09:16 2015 UTC,"Hopefully by then I'll be in the city. I live 25 miles from a city with fiber(1Gbps) to the home that's adorable, so I can have a good connection AND be able to see my parents. Also, they have companies moving into that town that I would like to get a job at, so it's like heaven on Earth to me."

playstation,38dcqh,ElectricBlitz,2,Wed Jun 3 21:21:37 2015 UTC,"Other outlets have reported that this new model is also listed as having a lower wattage power supply and a lower weight, meaning that this is actually a possibility. A die shrink would lower power requirements but I think we may be too early for that, and it also wouldn't cause 300g or so to be shaved off the weight."

Scrolled by it yesterday and was too bummed out to read it, since the oppinion of a Naughty Dog dev is far more educated than mine. Then saw it again today and opened it to see if anyone had a nuanced oppinion. But otherwise it'd went in my memory as a dissapointment in the PS4."
playstation,388vw3,hoddap,2,Wed Jun 3 07:31:01 2015 UTC,"Shit, people actually read the original article?"
playstation,388vw3,priapproved,2,Wed Jun 3 04:14:58 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with this, PS3 had its own unique hardware that developers took a loooong time to get their coding right to maximise its performance. PS4 hardware is more PC like meaning they already know what it can do."
playstation,388vw3,pablo2008jedi,5,Wed Jun 3 14:36:32 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that the launch of this generation has been the lamest. Shit new titles, awful launch titles and made fuck all impression that games were moving forward. Everything just got slightly shinier with new features.   The only excitement I can really think of that I experienced was that Sony bested Microsoft over there game ownership policies."
playstation,388vw3,DandyBean,3,Wed Jun 3 00:52:38 2015 UTC,Because every gen but this had such great launch titles.  Edit: words
playstation,388vw3,TheBufferPiece,4,Wed Jun 3 02:02:21 2015 UTC,"CPU power is going to hold the current gen back a bit.  Cell is actually faster by some measures than the 8-core Jaguar CPUs.  The GPUs are solid and I think we will see some nice visual improvements as time goes on.  I don't think we'll see many games that run at 60 fps at 1080p, though."
playstation,388vw3,Aram_Fingal,2,Tue Jun 2 20:31:45 2015 UTC,Because modern gaming is very reliant upon faster and faster cpus?  I don't think that jibes.
playstation,388vw3,putzarino,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:50:53 2015 UTC,"It is, though good developers will scale their CPU workload appropriately for the platform.  Take games that are pushing the envelope in terms of onscreen NPCs as an example.  AC: Unity runs better on X1 than PS4 because of the higher CPU clock and more available cores.  GPU is not the bottleneck in that game.  PS4 could no doubt render it at a fairly solid 30 fps if the CPU could keep up.  What's disappointing (and appropriately so) is that current gen consoles are the lowest common denominator target platform for most games, so PC gamers with many times the CPU performance of the consoles will, in most cases, not see developers take advantage of this.  This is not a new problem, but the PS3 and Xbox 360 were a better match for their PC contemporaries."
playstation,388vw3,Aram_Fingal,2,Tue Jun 2 22:00:56 2015 UTC,"As a PC and console gamer, it annoys me when people say this.   Witcher 3 is a perfect example of why this is rubbish. They clearly built for PC and then scaled back."
playstation,388vw3,MCam435,3,Tue Jun 2 22:58:14 2015 UTC,Most games are not Witcher 3 and in more ways than this.
playstation,388vw3,Aram_Fingal,2,Wed Jun 3 05:25:35 2015 UTC,"So basically he says it won't, but then says it probably will? What?"
playstation,388vw3,btdandurand,4,Tue Jun 2 21:35:35 2015 UTC,"It's kinda like 10 years ago, when gamers said that graphics are as good as they can get, but now we're closer to photo realism than ever before. Physically imagining graphical improvement is hard, but realistically it's going to happen."
playstation,388vw3,BlueBlur8,3,Tue Jun 2 22:19:29 2015 UTC,I just want more render distance in games
playstation,388vw3,TheCowfishy,2,Tue Jun 2 22:35:52 2015 UTC,"I feel like this goes pretty close with fps. You wouldn't want a higher fps if the render distance is shit, and what's good render distance if you can only see it standing still?  I'd still like to see a higher fps though."
playstation,388vw3,LordKwik,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:43:46 2015 UTC,"Back when the XB1 and PS4 were announced a friend asked me how graphics could get any better. Basically I told them two things.  1.) Little things will improve. Particles, framrates, AI, etc. The Witcher 3 could easily be done on last gen tech but what current gen and PC add are higher levels of foilage, better lighting, more things happening, dynamic weather, I could go on.   2.) The spread of graphic quality will improve dramatically. When every game starts to look as good as The Last of Us, then we'll have reached a peak of sorts."
playstation,388vw3,btdandurand,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:13:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's got to be a threshold for graphics eventually. I guess that's why Sony are looking for other ways to innovate - i.e. Project Morpheus."
playstation,388vw3,BlueBlur8,-1,Wed Jun 3 00:04:40 2015 UTC,No shit Sherlock
playstation,388vw3,pdelponte,-8,Tue Jun 2 18:22:49 2015 UTC,"all these developers complained that ps3 was so difficult to develop for, well duh! Good things take time. Had they taken the time to learn to develop for the cell, ps3 would have had a much longer life span and ps4 would have continued with the cell at a more advanced level. It also would have helped had sony actually given the developers free dev kits or at least made them affordable giving a higher insentive....but noooooo that just made too much sense and as we all know, we can't do things that make sense, now can we.  This is why we can't have good things."
playstation,388vw3,haixin,10,Tue Jun 2 18:28:50 2015 UTC,"I think you are way off base on several fronts. 1: the Cell processor was difficult to develope for. There is not really any reason to defend it. If devs cannot make cost effective games, they cannot stay in business. 2: a jump to HD only happens once. The jump from 640x480 to 1280x720, or 1920x1080 is huge in contrast to what we are doing this gen, last gen, and probably all future generations, which is running the game at a resolution that the console can handle and then scaling it up to your TV resolution. 3: the price and cost of games. Game costs have gone up. Game prices have stayed the same(gone down). With inflation, a $60 game in 2005 cost $73 in 2015. Game development has gone up with higher asset quality. 4: the rise in x86 performance and the modern GPU. When the 360 and PS3 launched, they were sold at a loss and had hardware you couldn't buy(or the equivalent of) in a PC. Today's consoles are midrange PCs, and that's okay. We just have to understand a $400 PS4 will never push native 4K like a $650 GPU. If Sony and Microsoft wanted to push the limits like they did in the past, everyone would be pissed at the price of the systems, which would be close to $1,000. This generation is a ""good enough and better than the old stuff"" generation. Not the balls to the wall hardware of the last gen."
playstation,389bgn,crimsonchaos284,5,Tue Jun 2 19:07:56 2015 UTC,I used a qtip and some alcohol to gently clean my controller one time. It worked pretty well
playstation,389bgn,HeadCrusher3000,3,Tue Jun 2 23:17:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the vaseline method but if you need to make it less squeaky you can take a thick pencil and sort of colour the gap between the trigger and hinge.

playstation,38b83e,stereotypeless,2,Wed Jun 3 02:45:45 2015 UTC,"With that in mind, if you like things to match then the white would be a good choice for that if it'll be close to the One.  Personally I like things to match, and it would bother me if they didn't next to each other.  Each version looks pretty great so it comes down to personal preference on what you'd like."
playstation,38b83e,DanReddit92,-8,Wed Jun 3 02:57:22 2015 UTC,They'll actually be about 5 feet away from each other with other electronics in between. More than anything I want the consoles to stand out from the other electronics. And my Wii U is red(custom painted to match the color of the red Gameboy Advance SP) so matching colors is out the window.

playstation,388bkl,BuckyDuran,2,Tue Jun 2 15:51:55 2015 UTC,Owning both I can tell you the interface is far more responsive on the ps4 than on the ps3. I hardly ever use the ps3 anymore & for $175 I'd definitely jump on that as it's a hell of a deal.
playstation,388bkl,Mallion1,0,Tue Jun 2 18:55:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I've pretty much decided against it since it sounds like I can't run the PS1/PS2 classic games on it from PSN. This was the type of difference I was looking for, but if I can't take a ride down nostalgia lane, I'm gonna pass. It's unfortunate. :/"
playstation,388bkl,Mallion1,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:16:11 2015 UTC,"There is PSNow. That having been however I would strongly recommend simply picking up the older consoles if you're looking for nostalgia factor. Games can be had in the cheap & while I'm not one to advocate piracy, modding a PS1 & a PS2 would give you access to ""rarer"" titles with little to no expense. If you fell in love with a specific title & want it as a collectible you could then go down the route of tracking down a physical copy. When it comes to the older consoles I don't personally want them digitally on my new system. I don't buy anything digitally if it can be helped as it's destroying the future of a hobby I genuinely enjoy."

From what I know, you can't do it (yet) with the PS4 because Sony was scared of the PS4 being hacked from a third party software on the HDD.  So if you plan on getting the PS4 to be a media server, forget it. :("

playstation,388bkl,ActualButt,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:40:13 2015 UTC,"But overall, compared to having a PS3 for Netflix and what have you, is it really even worth spending that? Doesn't quite sound like it, to me."
playstation,388bkl,metroidfan220,2,Tue Jun 2 16:41:05 2015 UTC,"It depends. Is it worth it to you to to buy a new one for upwards of $400? Certainly not. But $175 is a pretty good deal for a more powerful machine with a lot more storage and functionality. The Spotify app is great for parties. The amount of original creative indie games is impressive and growing all the time. But if you just have no interest in games, then no, I guess it really isn't worth it.  Like I said, I've been playing a lot more console games than I used to since I got mine because so many of the games are so good, but if that wasn't a draw for me then I could see myself regretting the purchase."

Obviously you wont get any sound since it's [a] a monitor and [b] DVI (no sound on DVI), so you'll either need to use a headset in the console's USB at the front or the controller port, or the audio out on the back of the console.  Should work."

It should work though, as long as your monitor supports HD resolutions, and you may need to fiddle with the HDCP settings.  An HDMI -> DVI cable is just like an HDMI -> HDMI but with no sound, they use the same video signal.

playstation,37yyqo,bassistb0y,2,Sun May 31 16:20:31 2015 UTC,Might end up being cheaper to buy a ps3 and any trivia game than a PSVita TV+Memory card+Game (if there is any).
playstation,37yyqo,enekomh,1 point,Sun May 31 20:55:24 2015 UTC,"A quick search on ye old Google yielded the Buzz! series as a popular suggestion.  Another quick search on the NA webstore yielded 14 PSP items of various categories priced at USD$3-4 and a base game at $15.  Aforementioned items clearly state Vita compatibility which is a great sign, but you're not out of the ballpark yet. There are still issues with certain games working on the Vita but not the TV version so by looking at CheapAssGamer's community list,at least the base game (and perhaps the additional content) is compatible.    TL;DR:  Quick research can yield effective results. Your best bet starting off would be the Buzz! series (PSP) as it has a wide variety of additional categories available. The biggest thing to consider is the TV's potential supported library (PS1, P, Vita, 3Now , and 4Remote Play ) and then checking if those games are supported.    Edit:  /u/enekomh mentioned the cost of a PS3 compared to the TV's price entry which is more of a subjective matter. Starting off, the TV's internal 1GB of storage would be enough to hold the base Buzz! game (~650MB) and a few of the additional categories (~30MB each) removing the upfront cost of a memory card. The cost of a controller is variable as you may already have one. If you get the TV in a bundle (which I would recommend) it'd include a dedicated memory card and controller."

That's gonna be boring for you IMO.   If you're anything like me, you're gonna be thinking about how everything you play through relates to the ending you already know so it won't be as immersive.   That being said, it's a great game no matter what. I would still play it just for the great acting, scenery, dynamic, and emotional ups and downs.

Stories are a part of human culture that speaks to people on a personal, empathetic level. This is why you see the same types of myths come up time and again in various cultures.  TLoU obviously speaks to a vast majority of people. They find something compelling about the world, characters, or situations, and see something true about human nature or perhaps something of themselves in the telling. I'm sorry it doesn't speak to you in the same way, but everyone's psychological upbringing and underpinnings are different and it seems like yours falls too far from the bell curve to be affected by this one.  But to think you can use some sort of logic to criticize a story and patiently wait for refutations is to misunderstand the power of stories and how they affect people in the first place."

On PS3 there was a similar issue that I've encountered where my connection would periodically drop while using wireless. I found that I wasn't the only one with that issue, and that the way to fix it was to stop broadcasting your SSID. For some reason, if your wifi is there but not telling anyone it's there, and then your system searches for it using the exact name, it stops random disconnections.  That was on PS3. Perhaps Sony never fixed the issue?"

playstation,37sxl5,terrorismofthemind,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:57:30 2015 UTC,It's so worth paying for both. And if you have an ipad you can remotely control spotify via the app.
playstation,37sxl5,Heroslayer44,1 point,Sat May 30 03:30:05 2015 UTC,I got the first month free and it never renewed for me because I don't have my PS wallet linked with my card. I can still use Spotify but I'll get a random ad here and there.
playstation,37peje,Imneverhomy,10,Fri May 29 10:35:18 2015 UTC,"FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS PURE WAIT UNTIL AFTER E3. I almost guarantee that one of the systems you mentioned is going to get a price drop. Rumor has it that the Vita is going to be $89. I made a video on that here.  I would say go for a PS3. The exclusives on that machine are breathtaking, and Uncharted actually became one of my favorite franchises. Not to mention the games are fairly cheap nowadays and the graphics have held up decently over the years. I have a Vita and played on a PS3 for half a decade before going to a PS4. The Vita shines through in the indie genre but other than a few AAA titles (Uncharted: Golden Abyss, Killzone Mercenary, Unit 13) there isn't much to write home about.  Best of luck, and enjoy whatever system you pick up :)"
playstation,37peje,theprettychillguy,3,Fri May 29 11:13:50 2015 UTC,"OH GOD I ALMOST FORGOT. The PlayStation Plus offerings for the PS3 are normally really impressive. I am talking games that I would pick up in store if I still played on a PS3. That is a service that is definitely worth getting, and if you choose a Vita, still go for Plus. If you end up getting a PS4 somewhere along the line, then you will already have the service and until then there are going to be a lot of awesome games that you can play."
playstation,37peje,theprettychillguy,3,Fri May 29 12:54:33 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm the only person here that's gonna say Vita. As a fellow PC gamer, I honestly just don't touch either my PS3 or PS4. But I play my Vita a ton. There's so many good game for it that are just kind of out there. Danganronpa and Danganronpa 2 are games that I highly recommend"

playstation,37peje,Festive_davidks2009,2,Sat May 30 01:39:52 2015 UTC,"What chill guy said, wait til e3 so you know what the status of both consoles is.  Sony said that the vita is a ""legacy device"" and the PS3 is almost 10 years old. Chances are they will either get a price drop, or be discontinued. You are better off waiting."
playstation,37peje,survyguy79,2,Fri May 29 12:46:40 2015 UTC,"The thought of the PS3 getting discontinued not only disappoints me, but also makes me feel quite old. But you are most likely spot on, the PS3 is going to get discontinued either this year or next year if I had to guess but I have no doubts Sony is going to go out with a bang. I think that the PlayStation 3 is entering that twilight stage of its cycle where Sony really will start to push the yearly sports games and maybe some indies here and there."
playstation,37peje,theprettychillguy,2,Fri May 29 12:53:04 2015 UTC,"PS3 definitely. SO many good games on there, and even free ones if you're a PlayStation+ subscriber. Hardly anything decent on a Vita!"
playstation,37peje,James_RW,2,Fri May 29 13:52:34 2015 UTC,"Depending where you are, if you look hard enough for a PS3 on like craigslist, you can find people that just don't care anymore...   I've been purchasing PS3's for the past month and a bit and have paid as little as $40bucks for a PS3 with games and remote..."
playstation,37peje,XSlor,2,Fri May 29 15:12:22 2015 UTC,ps3.. i have the vita also and Its basically an indie/RPG console.. AAA titles are far and few between and Im pretty sure sony are putting in next to no thought into promoting it so it falls further and further behind as a choice console.
playstation,37peje,kebabish,2,Fri May 29 15:59:28 2015 UTC,"I would say PS3, but there are so many remasters coming out who knows what's next. It's been pretty much confirmed that the Uncharted collection is being made. The Last of Us already has a remaster out. The Vita needs all the help it can get at this point."
playstation,37peje,jhorn1,2,Fri May 29 16:02:17 2015 UTC,"PS3 for Uncharted, MGS4 and the large library of PS1/PS2 games on PSN."
playstation,37peje,Kmiller9959,2,Fri May 29 17:00:57 2015 UTC,"I own both...  I think you will get the better value out of PS3 unless you travel with your handheld a lot.  You can use PS3 as the bluray player... The game selections (in English) are much wider than vita.  Plus it's much easier for you to get used games or cheap games on PS3.  Unless there is a particular game you want to play on vita, PS3 would be more worthwhile IMO."
playstation,37peje,yui_himesama,2,Fri May 29 17:29:55 2015 UTC,"I play almost all genres except WRPG(skyrim/witcher) and FPS(CoD/BF). I am however a fan of third person action RPG/shooters, JRPGs, strategy,    The Vita's library pretty much perfectly fits your requirements then, honestly. There's only one good FPS, no WRPGs I can think of, and lots of great JRPGs (even more if you count PSP games), shmups, 3D action games, 2D fighters, and SRPGs.  For fans of Japanese games, Vita has more releases scheduled in Japan than any other platform. Not all will make it to the US, but if you like JRPGs you really should own a Vita.  If you want specific title recommendations, I'll indulge you, or go to /r/vita, where dispelling the ""Vita has no games"" myth is our #1 pastime."
playstation,37peje,VicisSubsisto,1 point,Fri May 29 23:25:51 2015 UTC,"Woah! Thanks for the input guys! Looks like the general consensus here is that I should just get PS3 or wait til E3 for the price drop.  No love for vita huh.:( Was really tempted to buy it for unknown reasons lol. Guess I'll just wait until E3 then before deciding. Best case scenario is that I get a PS3 and play almost 10 years worth of exclusive game. Worst case, I waste a month's worth of savings.  A brand new PS4 is still close to triple of what I have. So a PS4 is out of the question, maybe I'll buy it next year. I mean it still has prolly a few years before ps5 comes along, right?"
playstation,37peje,Boshemo,1 point,Fri May 29 23:01:16 2015 UTC,"As an owner of both, it really depends on what kind of game you prefer. Indie games (Vita) or every other kind of game (PS3)."
playstation,37peje,Redheadkitten,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:39:08 2015 UTC,"I think what it's really going to break down to is: do you want to play games on the go, or stay home and play? I haven't a PS3, Vita, and PS4, and I play my PS3 and Vita about equally, but I like that the Vita typically gets enhanced versions of PS3 JRPGs that I can play on the go or at home (or on the PSTV, if I had one).   I'd say, wait until after E3, then look up titles from each and choose the one that has more of the games you want."

I didn't have an issue with equipping the weapons... however right after you die in by the hands (or teeth) of a wolf, I ended up in the cemetery... I was lost in there trying to get out for like at least an hour lol... I had to google how to get out... I haven't even progressed in the game much... hopefully I'll get some gaming time this weekend."
playstation,37pq7b,XSlor,3,Fri May 29 14:58:17 2015 UTC,"1 - After your first trip to the dream you can pick a weapon and gun.  Once you've chosen  press options to bring up your inventory and equip them there.  2 - You can now return to the clinic and fight the werewolf.  Proceed from there, go slow, watch for enemies and take the time to learn how to doge, parry, and use your weapon effectively.  3 - Die.  A lot."
playstation,37pq7b,Voyager5555,2,Fri May 29 15:45:05 2015 UTC,"Yup, I picked both up. They are both in my inventory. When I click [X] it gived me an option to USE or DISCARD. I try to USE however it makes a noise and I can not equip either the left handed weapon or right handed weapon via the OPTIONS menu."
playstation,37pq7b,Voyager5555,2,Fri May 29 15:46:31 2015 UTC,"Ok, click Options to get to the screen with your inventory, etc.  The second row should be 4 blank boxes.  Select and click on the first (your primary R hand weapon) and choose the weapon you picked up earlier, then press R2 to move to your gun.   It is a little weird because your weapons/armor aren't equipped using the inventory, but rather their own slots on the menu screen."
playstation,37pq7b,Balthor,2,Fri May 29 15:55:16 2015 UTC,"Be careful. Always lure enemies away from their friends, easier to pick off guys individually. If someone looks too tough for you, avoid them and come back later to crush them. Use all your items, be sure to save a few molotovs for bosses. Don't worry about dying and losing souls, it's easy to get them back. Don't underestimate the ferocity of a fully charged R2 attack. Be sure to use shards to upgrade your weapons; your saw and axe are great and will keep their value/power through most of the game. Unlike Demon's Souls, being aggressive and violent is viable in this game IF you have the jump on an enemy."

It would be nice if there was an ""Equip"" option in the inventory system or if you have no weapons equipped the first 2 are auto equipped.  Probabaly the worst ""first 10 minutes"" of a game I have ever experienced. I'll try again tonight and see if I can figure it out."
playstation,37pq7b,NoTFTLight,2,Fri May 29 15:08:39 2015 UTC,In the menu options second to last row there should be empty slots you can equip weapons there
playstation,37pq7b,bluerat,1 point,Fri May 29 16:20:42 2015 UTC,Continuously dying without being able to level up can't become really frustrating early on. I'd suggest you run it tell the first boss. Don't have to kill it. Then you can level up at the hunters dream area by talking to the doll.

If every digital game that comes out has a $ 5-10 discount it will give me a reason to buy these brand new games digitally.

playstation,37m50f,LadyVixenne,6,Thu May 28 22:01:19 2015 UTC,For the amount of money you'd save all together throughout the year on these sales.... It'd probably even out to the cost of a PS+ subscription.

I'm a PS4/Xbox One user (some PC), so it's not a PC Master Race thing :)  Sony is getting there with some of the older titles, but the prices really need to be at least a bit lower.  I shouldn't be able to find a physical copy cheaper than their digital deal (and I almost always can)."

playstation,37m50f,TwoWayForward,3,Thu May 28 21:01:56 2015 UTC,I never expected that. Why lower the prices when people are willing to pay?  But I did fully expect them to push digital distribution.
playstation,37m50f,SycoJack,2,Thu May 28 21:11:49 2015 UTC,"Simply because it makes sense for digital sales to be cheaper. No refunds, less materials, and limited console storage space therefore cheaper products. Even if only marginally. Movies, music, and games on other platforms all cost less digitally.  I also somewhat expected sales to somewhat rival platforms such as steam."

It would have been counter to the trend.  The industry isn't very fond of pro consumer moves. Lower prices would have benefited us more than them. Hell  even PC games have gone up in price."

Racing games, FPS, etc.  If you want to try FPS you should try playing something like Portal. I know it seems like a bit of an unusual recommendation but it is a great game for learning FPS controls in a fun environment."

playstation,37mt41,AQuestionMarkk,2,Thu May 28 22:29:31 2015 UTC,Destiny has the best feeling controls of any shooter I've ever played (admittedly not a huge number). Not a lot of crazy combos to remember. It can be challenging in spots but its pretty easy to find people to join you and help.  It plays great on both gens but load times are much shorter on ps4.  As a guy who'd never really used a console controller before six months ago that would be my recommendation. I found it a lot easier to pick up than say shadow of mordor.

Keep in mind though as it is a straight PS2 port it does look pretty soft as it is pretty crudely upscaled.  I found it hard to play and if you can afford it I would suggest a PSTV with the low prices right now and get Golden on that.

playstation,37j2nk,sporkbox,4,Thu May 28 00:12:05 2015 UTC,Welcome! All I have to say is get the Uncharted trilogy and The Last of Us if you are into those kinds of games. What's the point of buying a PlayStation 3 and not getting the best exclusives.
playstation,37j2nk,Pechenator,1 point,Thu May 28 03:26:07 2015 UTC,"Those are third person shooters, right? They didn't look like my cup of tea, but I remember the frenzy surrounding TLOU when it came out, especially when it had that saving bug (which I hope is fixed now).  I forgot to list the games we bought in the OP, so I'll take care of that."
playstation,37j2nk,Aharvey9807,5,Thu May 28 03:56:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly they're very loosely 3rd person shooters. Uncharted is very Tomb Raider-esque. It's more like playing an Indiana Jones movie, except you control Indy. TLOU primarily relies on its atmosphere to tell you a story, with some shooty bits in between. A lot of it requires stealth too. I'd recommend picking them up, especially since they're pretty cheap now. Also you should try Final Fantasy XIII. Not the best in the series, but if you like JRPGs, it's worth a shot. Also, Ratchet and Clank."
playstation,37j2nk,NoTFTLight,1 point,Thu May 28 04:22:05 2015 UTC,They are third person games that have shooting in them but they are far from a generic third person shooter. Action/adventure with amazing stories. Why didn't you just get a PS4?
playstation,37j2nk,NoTFTLight,1 point,Thu May 28 04:40:50 2015 UTC,Why didn't you just get a PS4?   It doesn't have any games we wanted. The x86 architecture also means I'm generally better off with my PC.

I know I'm going to get down voted for this but I can't let you get away with glossing over the works of art by Naughty Dog as ""third person shooters"".

playstation,37j2nk,cocobandicoot,1 point,Thu May 28 07:19:51 2015 UTC,"In my opinion The Last of Us in particular should be regarded as a mile stone in the history of video games.    Could you tell me why? I didn't mean to say anything negative about the game, but based on some vids I saw, it seemed kinda like an interactive movie involving what looks like cordyceps zombies. Premises like that aren't really in my ballpark, but I'd be willing to read what you have to say about it."
playstation,37j2nk,MCam435,2,Thu May 28 10:47:33 2015 UTC,"TLOU has one of the best stories in any video game, ever (as well as Ni No Kuni). The atmosphere is near perfect, as is the voice acting, and the gameplay is solid. It's an emotional journey. Besides, you can pick it up fairly cheap these days. I genuinely think you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you don't at least try it. (I didn't think it would be my cup of tea either, and by the end it was in my top 5).  Also regarding region lock, since no one else has mentioned it, there is one game that was region locked, which is persona 4 arena. Something to do with publishing rights I believe (not 100% on that). Everything else should be grand.  Finally, no one has mentioned Rogue Legacy. An awesome rogue-like."
playstation,37j2nk,Slytax24,4,Fri May 29 08:23:14 2015 UTC,"Congrats on the new console. I'm a firm believer that people should be platform agnostic, and makes the most of all the gaming options out there— regardless if it's Nintendo, PS3, PC, or even old school Sega if you're into it. That said, with your previous experience having played many games on Nintendo consoles, you'll find that the PlayStation will have a vast library of games that are worth checking out.  Based on the wide variety of games made on the PlayStation over the years, you will find that many people will recommend games in a variety of genres. A few top examples...   Little Big Planet (series) Crash Bandicoot (series) Tomb Raider (series) The Last of Us Uncharted (series) God of War (series) Final Fantasy (series) Metal Gear Solid (series) Grand Theft Auto (series) Resident Evil (series) Castlevania Symphony of the Night   That said, some of these games might not be up your alley (everyone has their own preferences, of course). But these are likely considered some of the best on the PlayStation platform of all time.  You might notice that some of the games I mentioned on that list are not PS3 games, per se, but include older, classic PlayStation titles. What is especially neat about the PS3 is its backwards compatibility with previous PlayStation models (something that Nintendo has done for awhile, but is sadly fading away in the console market). PS1 games (including old school disc-based games) can be played out-of-the-box on the PS3, which means you could pick up plenty of titles from your local used games shop, or download them from the PlayStation store. Some of the best games out there, including a number of RPGs like you mentioned, can be found on the PS1. So you have the added benefit of catching up on those classic titles by now playing them on PS3.  Note: PS2 titles are a little different; while the first generation of the PS3 included PS2 backwards compatibility, all models since then no longer have it supported (for disc-based games, anyway). You can still download PS2 games from the PlayStation store, but popping in a disc won't work unless you have a first gen model PS3. Just a heads up.  That said, you have an entire 20+ years of PlayStation games you could choose from. From the classics — such as Mario's old rival Crash Bandicoot, or the perhaps the most popular RPGs of all time (Final Fantasy VII, VIII, IX, through today's XIII) — to the more modern, almost cinematic (practically playable movies) like Uncharted or The Last of Us (both absolutely beautiful games, by the way)... there are some really great titles out there.  You'll find that many of these games will have their own dedicated following, some of which you can find right here on Reddit. For instance, although Crash Bandicoot hasn't had a classic game in almost 15 years, they still have a subreddit of a small (but passionate!) group of fans in /r/crashbandicoot. Or the more lively following in /r/finalfantasy or /r/thelastofus. These are all made up of really great fans of these titles, and you'll find the content of their discussions are generally of high caliber, not just on Reddit, but throughout the Internet. Of course, that likely isn't the case for all games; I probably wouldn't recommend /r/callofduty or /r/codaw (unless you happen to get really into first person shooters all of the sudden). So your mileage may vary depending on the title, and how long ago it was released.  You'll always find helpful responses in the console forums and subreddits themselves. In fact, I would recommend you also post this submission in /r/PS3, as I think it will get more visibility there. I'm sure there are plenty of people that would be happy to provide you with some suggested titles in the genres that you have mentioned.  If there's anything else that comes to mind, don't hesitate to let us know. And most importantly, just have fun with it!"
playstation,37j2nk,ibrahimkb5,2,Thu May 28 12:19:04 2015 UTC,"Awesome, that sounds great. I knew the older model supported PS1 and 2, but didn't know current models still supported PS1. We picked up the Super Slim, I think. It has the sliding disc lid, 2 USB 2.0 ports, and a 500 GB HDD. Will that one still support PS1 games, too? If so, that's awesome. That's another reason I didn't get the PS4; backwards compatibility is important and adds value to hefty purchases.  I've been thinking about picking up the latest Tomb Raider, made by Squeenix, but I heard that the game holds your hand a lot and it doesn't capture the same creepy feel of the original. What are your thoughts on that?  I played through LBP with a friend years ago. I liked the level creation concept. Has much changed in 2 or 3? My chief complaint with the first is the jumping was kinda dodgy and the platforming mechanics didn't allow for more dynamic movement like wall-jumping.  I was actually thinking about posting this on /r/ps3, but it didn't seem like it fit in with their content. They have a rule explicitly against general game recommendation threads. I didn't want my first PS post to be in the wrong place, so I opted for here."
playstation,37j2nk,Slytax24,1 point,Thu May 28 20:41:58 2015 UTC,I actually couldn't disagree more regarding Tomb Raider. It was a massive return to form for the series. I've been a fan since TR1. It's definitely creepy.
playstation,37j2nk,ibrahimkb5,3,Fri May 29 08:11:32 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, welcome to the PlayStation family!   If you are into rouge likes you should definitely pick up The Binding of Issac:Rebirth if you haven't already got it on PC. This is easily the game I play most, plus it has a large expansion coming soon!  There are tons of great JRPG's on PS. Ni no Kuni is a beautiful game that while not as long as most other games of its type, really sticks with you. And if your into anime it was made in coordination with Studio Ghibili (Princess Mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle, ect.) so that's a plus! It's wonderful and it makes me happy you picked it up while it was on sale so you can experience this beautiful story.  I see you are also interested in Tales of Xillia. It's definitely worth getting if your a fan of any of the other Tales Of... games. Every Tales game has something some people like and some don't but I am really enjoying my time with Xillia right now. There are a lot of fun combos you can pull off and I am really enjoying the contrast in combat between many of the characters, As a fan of JRPG's I'm sure you are familiar with the Final Fantasy series so no need to go there although I am enjoying FF typeZERO despite its dated control scheme and graphics. (Due to it being a PSP release back in the day)  One other series I HAVE to recommend is the Kingdom Hearts series. The story of these games gets pretty complicated throughout the series but they are all so satisfying to play and just experience. Plus with Kingdom Hearts 3 coming out in the near future now is the best time to catch up!  Oh and before I forget, Valkyria Chronicles is super worth it. Its a turn based strategy game akin to the Fire Emblem Series except you aren't confined to a top down grid based battlefield. There are those that say its more like watching and interactive movie due to how long some of the cutscenes are but I personally enjoy them and the world they help build.   Just to address some other games you mentioned, Demon Souls and Dark Souls are great. If you have you heart set on the souls games I preferred Dark Souls. I'm pretty sure you can start with either Demon or Dark Souls as I don't believe they are too closely related and are more stand alone. Dark Souls also has a sequel.  Super Stardust and Geometry Wars look incredibly fun. I remember playing Geometry Wars 2 and loving it but I don't own either of them so I can't say much more. Same with Project Diva, I've been looking at it myself recently but just haven't picked it up yet. With Sonic I believe the console release was only 30 FPS but i could be wrong so don't quote me on it. Still a fun game though and its nice to see another Sonic fan. (Sonic Adventure will always have my heart though)  One last thing! Be sure to look into all the PS exclusive franchises. The Ratchet and Clank series is a wacky cartoony shooter if that sounds fun. Jack and Daxter is a more mature fantasy shooter. Both have been compressed into ""collections"" by now if your interested. The Sly Cooper series is a thieving action adventure series with a cast of funny animated characters, again very fun and in a ""Collection"" by now. Journey is an incredible exploration game, well its more of an adventure experience..its hard to explain but one of the most beautiful games I've ever played and I can't recommend it enough. Also the Uncharted series is one of my favorites. Its like playing an Indian Jones movie every time and it is awesome.  OK! that about covers it. If you have any other questions I'd love to answer. I really enjoy everything about my Playstation and many of my most beloved franchises are on the platform. I hope you enjoy your new PlayStation as much as I have over the years."

playstation,37n32z,ABC_AlwaysBeCoding,7,Thu May 28 21:05:13 2015 UTC,No psa needed cheapskate they tell you that before you buy it.
playstation,37n32z,Magog14,-1,Thu May 28 23:05:18 2015 UTC,But they make exceptions
playstation,37n32z,Kmac09,2,Fri May 29 00:01:10 2015 UTC,"The key is ""exceptions"" those are exceptional circumstances not normal ones.  Returning a new game to a physical store is very unlikely as well.  Also seriously what did you buy at $60 that you didn't check the reviews for?"
playstation,37n32z,Kmac09,1 point,Fri May 29 15:07:09 2015 UTC,"The reviews were stellar. It's just a style of game I don't like. Unbeknownst to me, I didn't like the creator's previous games, either (somehow that was not mentioned in the reviews I read).  The game is Bloodborne, btw. Perhaps it makes more sense now. While people thought Demon's Souls was ""hard,"" I thought it was literally the work of the devil, and with a terrible UI to boot. So I'm playing Bloodborne and getting frustrated and I'm like ""this seems just like Demon's Souls, which I hated"" and sure enough I look up the creator and slap my forehead.  Meanwhile I think Witcher 3 is awesome, and I didn't like Witcher 2 much (I hate alchemy in games, and it had a huge focus on it, in addition to having a weird control scheme it didn't allow me to change at all!). Witcher 3 de-emphasizes alchemy, making it pretty much optional, and it has interesting but not brutally-difficult fighting, and a huge open world (Bloodborne is all-action and atmosphere and seemingly a very restrictive path through... and everyone visible wants to kill me, anyone ""sane"" won't open their doors to me... I just don't like it. It IS pretty, however), and I'm playing Witcher on PS4 instead of PC so the control scheme isn't nearly as annoying as Witcher 2 on PC was"
playstation,37n32z,therm0pyle,2,Fri May 29 17:43:42 2015 UTC,So honestly on Demons Souls and all the other Souls games they are definitely beatable.  They just require patience to learn patterns etc.  I will say I am not great about that patience personally so I am not a great judge.  I would give it more of a chance as you really have barely scratched the surface at that amount of time in those games.
playstation,37n32z,therm0pyle,2,Fri May 29 17:52:25 2015 UTC,I've gotten refunds for returns with no issue within a week. Quite a few others have as well. Try chatting back and getting somebody else.
playstation,37n32z,WaffleBombs,-1,Thu May 28 21:14:43 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I bought it a day or 2 ago and played it for just an hour or 2. All of that stuff is provable. Weird. I used their online chat, you think that calling them might get me better odds? (Easier to say no to someone online, and all that.)

playstation,37eydb,KILRbuny,1 point,Wed May 27 04:19:50 2015 UTC,Not that I've heard. I don't think Sony feels any pressure to drop the price of the PS4. It's selling like hot cakes and doesn't really show any signs of slowing down.
playstation,37eydb,morpheus647,2,Wed May 27 04:29:39 2015 UTC,If Microsoft drops the price of the Xbone below the PS4 I think Sony would follow suit. A lot of people will buy whatever is cheaper.
playstation,37eydb,KILRbuny,2,Wed May 27 14:18:22 2015 UTC,"The Xbone is already cheaper, at least here in the U.S. The PS4 runs $400 and the Xbone got cut to $350 after the holidays."
playstation,37eydb,kacboy,2,Wed May 27 14:26:12 2015 UTC,I would get one regardless. I'm thinking about things like limited editions or maybe even hardware changes. I'm highly doubtful of the latter but I'm curious.
playstation,37eydb,XSlor,1 point,Wed May 27 04:47:39 2015 UTC,I can garuntee there won't be any price drops for a few months or hardware changes for at least another year.

playstation,37eydb,Mikolos,2,Wed May 27 05:12:12 2015 UTC,Debatable. I mean it's only two weeks so it might be okay to wait.
playstation,37eydb,chickmagnet_,2,Wed May 27 13:56:04 2015 UTC,"The fact that E3 is so close is a legitimate argument for waiting, but generally speaking, E3 isn't any likelier to be the time and place of such an announcement than any other time of the year.  If anything, it's less likely.  E3 is a time to show off upcoming projects that won't be on the market for anywhere from several months to several years, and this is commonly understood.  A price drop or a new bundle is meant to reinvigorate sales and gets announced when it's nearly ready to go live, so as not to disrupt current sales if at all possible.  So it's kind of a bad strategic move for a company to announce such things concurrently with all the buzz and hype that's supposed to move consoles all by itself.  PS4 sales don't really need to be reinvigorated at this time, so the only reason for them to announce anything at E3 specifically would be as a populist move, perhaps meant to try and push the buzz through the roof the way Sony did in 2013.  Most price drops and bundle announcements actually happen in the fall, prior to the holiday shopping season.  If you want to read up on the subject in detail, I suggest the timeline of PS3 price cuts and the timeline of PS3 SKUs.  The only time in the PS3's lifetime that a major price shift was announced at E3 was in 2007, and even that was just a supplies-are-limited clearance of old stock to make way for a slightly upgraded SKU at the original retail price.  None of this is meant to guarantee that Sony won't change tactics with the PS4, because they can do whatever they want. But when it comes down to it, the odds that you'll be pleasantly surprised instead of mildly annoyed that you waited aren't in your favor."

playstation,37a989,zombieducklings,9,Tue May 26 03:21:20 2015 UTC,"The Tomb Raider remake is wonderful. If you have no problem with Lara killing a whole bunch of dudes. It's among my absolute favorite games ever, since it's just so polished (just ignore the multiplayer).  Dying Light lets you parkour on zombie heads! If first-person melee fighting is not a turn-off for you.  If you don't, you should totally have PS+ subscription, because there's lots of games through that (less value if you only have PS4, but this month's Quacamelee is awesome Metroid-vania-ish callback)."
playstation,37a989,FluffyBunbunKittens,2,Tue May 26 03:35:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reccomendations. I already played a big chunk of Tomb Raider on PS3 when it was a Plus game so I don't really want to get it again. But Dying Light seems really cool. I might get that one.
playstation,37a989,FluffyBunbunKittens,3,Tue May 26 03:44:09 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah, wasn't sure if you'd had PS3 already or not.  Shadow of Mordor! It gives you exploration and awesome personalized enemy orcs, and has the same kind of combat system as the Batman games, but ties heavy-handedly into Lord of the Rings lore, and has a limited color range (mostly brown, since Mordor). It's also very easy to turn the game into a cakewalk.  Sleeping Dogs Definite Edition, if you haven't played this before, it's like... GTA with more likeable characters. And a lot more focus on the melee combat. I played this back on 360, and reaaaaally liked it, my most favorite GTA-like ever.  The new Wolfenstein is actually good! It's a kind of back-to-basics approch, but it works. That or the Shadow Warrior remake, they both hit the same kind of tone.  Geometry Wars 3 is a very colorful, fun top-down shooter, if you'd be into that sort of a thing. Though Geometry Wars 2 is superior, IMO (though I guess that only came out for 360)."
playstation,37a989,Jon76,1 point,Tue May 26 04:09:51 2015 UTC,I wasn't aware Sleeping Dogs was like that. I thought it was a linear kung-fu game. I think I may have been confusing it with something else. That actually sounds really good. A lot of people recconended Shadow of Mordor so I might get that one.
playstation,37a989,AngryElijah,3,Tue May 26 19:03:55 2015 UTC,Shadow Warrior is a fun and challenging game

playstation,37a989,morrispated2,2,Tue May 26 05:35:18 2015 UTC,I actually played Watch_Dogs on PS3. It was good.
playstation,37a989,atomfaust,3,Tue May 26 19:00:45 2015 UTC,If you don't like hard games then you may as well stick to ass creed and call of duty. If you're willing to step outside your comfort zone a bit buy alien: isolation. That game is top shelf horror and in my opinion the best thing to ever come out of that universe.
playstation,37a989,killit,1 point,Tue May 26 15:34:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Alien: Isolation seems cool. If you know, how difficult is it compared to Bloodborne? Also, if I liked the first Dead Space, would I like this game?"
playstation,37a989,McCracKenway,1 point,Tue May 26 18:55:58 2015 UTC,I haven't played bloodborne or any of the dead space games but I have watched a friend play dead space and I would say that alien uses a significantly slower pace than dead space. It's significantly less shooter and more survival. In dead space the aliens are relatively disposable and you kill dozens of them whereas in alien you don't get a weapon that can actually repel the alien much less kill it until halfway through the game. From my experience dead space looks a lot more like a creep along and kill anything that jumps out and scares you whereas alien is very much a sneak around and pray that nothing finds you because of it does you're most likely going to die. Alien: isolation is without a doubt my game of the year 2014.
playstation,37a989,killit,1 point,Tue May 26 19:06:36 2015 UTC,That actually sounds a lot cooler than Dead Space. I've always wanted a AAA survival horror game without weapons.
playstation,37a989,BlueAndWhiteForLife,2,Tue May 26 19:12:19 2015 UTC,"I have always preferred alien when compared to aliens. Alien was amazing because it was this slow terrifying hunt where the people slowly realized they were not the hunters. Aliens was an all out action movie and while it was extremely enjoyable it didn't bring the terror that the first one did with its small scale claustrophobic atmosphere. Alien: isolation is the sequel that I've been waiting for since I was a child, it's much more like the first alien movie than aliens or dead space."

As long as you have friends and/or don't mind using looking for group sites the game is far from dead or to far ahead.  Also recommend Witcher and Bloodbourne. Dragonage Inquisition was fun aswell.

Clinically, addiction by its very nature is a detriment to life itself because once it takes hold then it makes everything else secondary.

playstation,376yq3,geophsmith,1 point,Tue May 26 01:22:21 2015 UTC,"TLDR: games are a great pastime, but be careful... In times of emotional hardship, they can become an addiction.   in the military, I fell on some hard times (friends dying + knocked up gf's miscarriage = Emotionally shut down). So I ended up immersing myself into alcohol and video games. I ignored my loyal girlfriend and would stay up WAY too late and end up only getting like 3 hrs of sleep before I had to report to work. I would not want to do anything out side of work with my fellow Marines. I didn't want any part of reality, so it was the video game world for me. This went on for years. My girl had left me (duh). Screw it, more time for games. The fantasy world that I lived in was far better than my Mechanic gig in the military. I started hating working in the airplane and detested talking to people. People thought that I was depressed (maybe I was) and that I was showing warning signs that I wanted to hurt myself, and in a way I was. I eventually they voluntold me the get counciling. As difficult as it was, it was better to talk out my problems than to just bury my head in the sand. I weened myself off and got back into shape (Marine shape;) and started socializing with people in person again.   Edit: Sorry for the rant, it's Memorial Day and I'm still hurting a little bit."

And overall the movement speed doesn't feel like a slug, like it did in BF3. I think a majority of people dislike BF3 because their expectations ruin it, from playing BC2, but you should give it a try, especially st the price. The DLC maps are some of the best!

It connects via HDMI to your TV and allows you to play a large number of Vita games and PS Classics (I include ps1 and PSP games in that category).

playstation,36ihm0,marginallyrad,3,Tue May 19 17:10:28 2015 UTC,"Generally: The Vita will act as a screen in Remote - the whole computing stuff for the gameplay is done on the PS4. So you can't have different things going on on your screen and Vita*.   If I interpret your (1) question right, you were asking if you could play Farcry with a buddy in the same room with one looking on the  tv screen and the other one looking on the Vita. In that case: No, that won't work. You would need two PS4s: One for the tv and one for the Vita. But there are some games where coop works pretty good: games where you are on the same screen as your coop partner. Trine for example.   (2) In some regions you can pay for Psnow. This will stream a selection of games to your Vita. Here is a list of available games: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_Now_games  As for remote play PS3 games outside of Psnow: Yeah, you need a PS3 for that. But there really are not many games that support it.   (3) If your Internet conection is good enough on both ends then: Yes! All games on the Ps4 are required to support Remote play.   As for your fourth question: To me personally the remote features are the least interesting and exciting things about my Vita! The Vita has racked up a massive library of awesome games ranging from obscure (but awesome) japanese rpgs to ""big"" action games like Uncarted. And inbetween there are TONS of middle to small games in all shapes and colors.   I still have my original Oled Vita and I'm gonna be holding on to it till the very last moment! I just love the feel of the device in my hands, the build quality. It makes me genuinly sad to see the Vita being treated like an ugly stepchild within the Playstation family.   Well, this sure got long... ramble, ramble... get a Vita, it's just a good device...  *Okay, there are a couple exceptions like Dead Nation, where you can have the Vita act as some sort of inventory."

I'm asking because I have the same problem, but there is a workaround. Is you are relatively close to the PS4 (one room, maybe two away), you can pair your phone with a secondary account, so when you enable remote play, it's more like a second screen.

I think you need to plug it once for pairing the two together. Just like pairing your DS4 to another PS4 system. I'm not sure it works, but it seems logical."

playstation,367uiz,mambo_matt,2,Sun May 17 00:31:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and after my few hour marathon I saved and quit and upon returning the main map doesn't remember my projectors. I want to play this game, but I am just going to wait until they patch it."
playstation,367uiz,Zalsha,2,Sun May 17 14:46:10 2015 UTC,I am having this issue also. I've encountered several glitches such as items in my inventory disappearing and completed projectors not showing up. I got to a point in the game where it just crashes now. I have loaded the save multiple times and it continues crashing. I replayed the game up to that point again and it keeps on crashing. It's very frustrating.
playstation,367uiz,Vespansi,2,Sun May 17 16:54:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, exact same thing here. One other thing is I somehow got out of the map and fell all the way down to the mines. I basically skipped a couple levels. I couldn't complete it though because I needed an item from the level before. It really does suck because the game is great, minus the crazy amount of bugs."

My ps4 couldn't even find ANY network connections, same with my actual computer, this has never happened before. It was like my router was off or something (bare with me, not the most tech savy). Usually when I open network connections on my PC, it has like 6 (close neighbors) and mine, I select mine, reconnect, etc. fine. Tonight when this happened, that list of connections was blank ""no connections available"", I've never had that happen.  I had to re-start few times before it would even pick up any of the wifi accounts, re-enter my wifi password andn stuff on my ps4, I'm on gta5 online right now. I have 2 friends online on my list as well. One playing bloodbourne, the other not playing right now.  yet still when I go to test my internet connection my ps4 page, it says error, some code letters/numbers, then network down, etc. yet im on gta5 online right now, so it doesn't make much sense."

playstation,35z4tf,jvjv88,12,Thu May 14 18:57:06 2015 UTC,"I own both consoles and a gaming PC. If you have the money it really is worth it to deck out an awesome PC and have a HUGE library of games from all genres. That being said if you really wanted a console it really depends. People on here are saying that PS4 has better graphics, to be completely honest I can't tell the difference (sorry guys I've tried so hard). PS4 has some sweet exclusives while XB1 is great for multimedia purposes (especially if you have cable). I personally prefer the XB1 controller only because you can reach the D-pad with your right thumb if you need to, that is crucial sometimes. Other than those things you really can't go wrong with either."

If you value experience, graphics, customizability(mods, pc look, pc components, controller/mouse), game selection, or medium/long term value nothing can compete with PC.   The PS4 v. X1 ends at which console you have more/quality friends on. Exclusives are nice, but nothing compares to a game you can spend 1000+ hours on with your good friends."

And I have a self-built gaming PC, a PS4, PS3, and XBOX 360.   I play games for their single player campaigns, and I seldom play online. So for me which console my friends have is irrelevant. Which console has the better exclusives is highly relevant. For me, that's the PS4 because Naughty Dog.   As far as PCs vs consoles in general... I appreciate the advantages PCs bring to the table, but I LOVE being able to put a disk in my console and know it's going to work. I play games to relax, the last thing I want to do is fight with my PC to make a game work. Some people really enjoy the tweaking and upgrading, and that's totally cool! But me, personally, I just want shit to work. Hence why I bought a PS4 instead of upgrading the graphics card in my PC."

Whether you prefer PC or PS4 is up to you, but don't get an Xbox One, it sucks."

The PS4 gets a lot of knock for not getting frequent updates like the xbox one, but that's because the stock PS4 firmware is still better than the shit dashboard that the xbox one has.   On the other hand, I would recommend PC over PS4 if you've got the dough. But, if you've got the dough, get both. Sony exclusives are worth the 400 dollar investment. Bloodborne is a good enough reason to own a ps4."

Other reasons why you might want to opt for a PS4 rather than a PC is that the PS4 is much easier to operate, convenient when it comes to the space it will take wherever you decide to put it and the lack of need for peripherals such as mouse and keyboard (down to preference).  Sorry I didn't mention the Xbox ONE at all, it's just that if I had to chose either a PC or a console, I'd definitely go for the PS4 due to PlayStation's background as a whole and I've also just preferred it since always so I guess you could say that's a little biased of me.

I enjoy shadow fall a lot!) And a few more.   Anyway, some games exist I'm the three platforms, but they don't run well in PC, like watch_Dogs, Assassins Creed, and many more.

In terms of massive game libraries, customization,  graphics etc. PC is the obvious choice. Can you build a pc for the same price as a ps4? Sure. I wouldn't recommend it though. Would you rather have your system in the living room while you sit on the couch and play on TV? Consoles might be better (sure you can put the pc there and get wireless keyboard and mouse but let's be honest most pc's stay in your room at your desk) . As for Ps4 vs xbone I'm a playstation guy but that's just me. Do you have friends over a lot that might want to play with you? Consoles. Do you spend most of your time gaming alone in your room? PC. Do you like online gaming? Give us some information."
playstation,35z4tf,ExtraGloves,1 point,Fri May 15 08:59:23 2015 UTC,"This turned into a circle jerk pretty quick but as console games that recognizes the vast superiority of the PC I'm gonna say go for a PC if you can afford it. I play consoles for simplicity it's the same reason I use a Mac and an iPhone: simple. I'm sure that if I wanted I could figure out an issue if I had one with a PC or an android but I just don't want to so I sacrifice graphics and mods and instead play on consoles. That being said if you're intent on a console they are all fantastic but for some reason the ps4 has an intangible characteristic that makes it feel like a better experience for gaming, it feels very reminiscent of the ps2. If you are gonna double it as an entertainment unit I would say Xbox. The Xbox has more apps and pulls the entire living room together while the ps4 feels like it is a gaming device with other things kinda tacked on. If you're looking for hardcore gaming get a PC. If you're looking for a simple device that's entirely for gaming get a ps4. If you're gonna have a widespread work load for gaming, entertainment, and TV get an Xbox. They all have their pros and cons it just depends on what you're going to use it for."

playstation,35z4tf,blazekon,1 point,Fri May 15 12:27:39 2015 UTC,"PC is, and as far as I'm concerned, always will be the best option if you want to invest the money. You get the most bang for your buck. That's all there is to it. But on the console side, it depends on what you want to use the console for. XB1 is good for streaming all types of media, including cable, with all the features it has like Snap, and the PS4 in my opinion is better for straight up gaming because of how great PS+ is. There's more to say, but it's all been said a million times in comparison videos, so watch some."
playstation,35z4tf,drbansquatch,1 point,Fri May 15 14:14:10 2015 UTC,"One thing about a PC, is the ability to MOD games. Far as I know the pc is the only medium that you can take a game for example like Skyrim and you can add a gun to the game or make a fully complte WWII game out of it. You can make additions to the game called addons, there a large groups of people that make them for games like World of Warcraft, Rifts and Elderscrolls Online. I doubt you would ever see that for the PS4 or Xbox One. The one draw back I do have for a PC is there is more of a larger base of hackers and cheaters then there is for the consoles."
playstation,35z4tf,Wankan_Tanka,1 point,Fri May 15 15:16:53 2015 UTC,"PC & Xbox One? Well PC obviously a larger selection of games, A more open gaming experience... I'll just stop there but i mean there is no contest when PC is in the mix but lets go down to PS vs Xbox.  No matter what any one says about the 2 systems this is important to remember.   It is all about  preference.   We can fight all day and night about what's better but truth tech wise they are almost equal, You will not notice a big difference between the 2 systems while in game  regardless of what anyone says.  PC & Xbox One    Work well together  PC is the best over all in every aspect of gaming Xbox One works well with Windows OS and with Windows 10 it will be even better.  Xbox One has Skype so if you want to talk to your PC friends while on Xbox One you can with no issues.  Xbox One has a great OS easy to navigate and looks really nice.  With Xbox One you can plug your PC in to it and head over to the TV app and use your TV as second screen for your PC like you would normally but you still are able to do everything on your xbox.    What i like about PS4. (After 1 day of use)    PS Now - Streaming PS3 games to PS4   Requires separate sub fee  from PS Plus but if there are some games you want to play its worth it.  Spotify   I Love spotify and being able to use it while on my console is nice.  Audio to Controller   Streams your PS4's audio to your controllers headset if its plugged in you can turn this on and off. It's really good for listening to music while playing."

playstation,35z4tf,GetChopped,0,Fri May 15 04:39:18 2015 UTC,"Over XboxOne, the PS4 is simply the superior machine. I'm not even sure you can call a system ""next-gen"" if it can't output the standard 1080p resolution. If you look at the same titles released for both systems, the PS4 supports either higher resolution or if matched, offers superior frame rates. Add to this exclusive titles like Bloodborne & there's not really a question of which system you should want to get between the two.  PC is a bit harder to trump only because it's entirely customizable & really only limited by your wallet. If you're on a budget the PS4 wins right out of the gate. I picked up one used for a friend off Craigslist a week back for $250. I bought mine new from the store just after Christmas last year for $350. A new gaming pc with components capable of handling PS4 quality output is going to set you back at least $700, if not more. For me personally I got tired of updating something every single time I went to game. I work a full time job & have a significant other so my gaming time is limited. It got to a point where I'd have only two free hours in the evening to game once or twice a week. I'd fire up the PC only to be told by Windows that I needed to wait while it finished updating. 45 minutes later it finishes so I boot up Steam only to be met with another update prompt. Suddenly my two hours of gaming has turned into 30 minutes of post frustration. With the PS4 it's just push the little center button on the controller & I'm gaming in under a minute flat. There's also the added bonus of not playing a game loaded over a potentially unstable OS. I can't count the times I wanted to throw my controller across the room because my pc blue-screened mid-game giving some obscure code relating to nothing of use which could help avoid it happening in the future.  The PS4 is my first major Sony system & while it's been a roller-coaster at times dealing with tech support, I'm still extremely happy I made the decision I did & would not go a different route given the option."

There's thousands of forums dedicated to PC game crashes, texture glitches, not launching properly etc etc. That's what finally made me exit the PC gaming market.

playstation,35xzqv,picko19,1 point,Thu May 14 20:56:18 2015 UTC,you should consider designing and selling one of these:  http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/file/view/beckoning_bell.jpg/545282662/beckoning_bell.jpg  WOULD BUY IN A HEARTBEAT
playstation,35xzqv,thraxxximundar,1 point,Thu May 14 20:39:50 2015 UTC,Thought about doing the bell though my list of stuff to get done is ridiculously looooong.

playstation,35xzqv,theBlumpkinBackfire,1 point,Fri May 15 10:15:02 2015 UTC,I want one! Plan on making more or maybe some of the other badges?
playstation,35zuxe,xMZA,2,Thu May 14 22:17:23 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately you can't.  If you buy it from the german store, you get the german version. There is only german audio and text on there (that's the way it was when the game got released back in the days - there weren't multiple languages on the disc as it's often the case nowadays).  If you want the english version, you'll have to buy it from the UK or US store. Sorry for that."

playstation,35yjzp,UTRR,2,Thu May 14 18:16:11 2015 UTC,I've had this problem for quite some time. Ended up having to buy a PS+ gift card at Best Buy to re-up my membership. Still cannot add funds to card on file.
playstation,35yjzp,TheWookMeister,1 point,Thu May 14 23:12:25 2015 UTC,my main credit card has never worked and I don't now why

playstation,35yjzp,jimiistave,1 point,Tue May 19 03:03:49 2015 UTC,"Started happening to me about a week ago. I was able to add my paypal account to buy The Witcher 3 this morning, but now it won't let me add anything via any method. Even my Paypal account is ""invalid"" and I can't delete and re-add it.  Oh, and my Vita decided to randomly ""forget"" my card info."

The weird thing is that I was just using it yesterday on the same site and it was fine. Maybe it has something to do with cookies or cache
playstation,35qts1,vyporx,20,Tue May 12 19:23:15 2015 UTC,http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/17/sony-settles-bridgestone-lawsuit-with-kevin-butler-actor He was fired.
playstation,35qts1,Igotyouripbitch,13,Tue May 12 19:31:36 2015 UTC,"Kevin Butler (portrayed by Jerry Lambert) was amazing in these advertisements. As much as the public loved him and were happy to watch his commercials, I don't think Sony will be hiring him back though. I'm not sure exactly what happened but iirc he was in an ad for Nintendo while still under contract by Sony, so they let him go. Sad sad world. I'd love to see him make a comeback though, even if it's not under the employment of Sony."
playstation,35qts1,JuanDanger,19,Tue May 12 19:34:31 2015 UTC,"It wasn't for Nintendo, it was for Bridgestone Tires.  Thing is, Bridgestone was sponsoring a promotional giveaway featuring the Nintendo Wii.  Lambert was shown in the ad playing Mario Kart Wii, not as ""Kevin Butler"" but as an unnamed Bridgestone employee.  Nonetheless, he was very clearly recognizable to gamers everywhere as ""Kevin Butler"", and Sony considered that a breach of his contract because it implied that their fictional character was capable of enjoying something else."
playstation,35qts1,infinitelives,2,Tue May 12 22:34:37 2015 UTC,I think he's in the geico commercials now.
playstation,35qts1,hustl3tree5,0,Wed May 13 01:00:45 2015 UTC,"Which is absolute bullshit. You can't shouldn't be able to essentially ""claim the rights"" to a living actor's physical likeness. That would be like Fox claiming ""breach of contract"" on Chris Evans for playing the role of Captain America because he's ""very clearly recognizable as the Human Torch.""  PS: For the sake of my analogy, let's pretend that Captain America: The First Avenger had released while the original Fantastic 4 movie franchise was technically ""alive"""
playstation,35qts1,xwatchmanx,5,Wed May 13 12:23:01 2015 UTC,"If his contract stated he wasn't allowed to promote another gaming console, then Sony are well within their rights to fire him."
playstation,35qts1,Nude-Love,1 point,Wed May 13 14:35:20 2015 UTC,"Iirc, the contract said that he couldn't appear in ads for competing products. He wasn't in an ad for a competing product, he was in an ad for a company that itself happened to be promoting a competing product. That's not the same thing.  Either way though, Sony's reasoning included, ""he resembled the Kevin Butler character,"" which, regardless of what the contract says, is a totally BS reason. It's not like he dressed up in tons of makeup with a specific look like Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, Kevin Butler was just a regular guy in regular clothes, so of course Perry Lambert ""resembled Kevin Butler."""
playstation,35qts1,xwatchmanx,1 point,Wed May 13 15:26:46 2015 UTC,Being in an ad playing a competing product is entirely in the spirit of the original contract term imo. Really he should have known better.
playstation,35qts1,PhillAholic,2,Wed May 13 17:39:58 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. At the very least, he should've considered it enough of a gray area to check before doing it."
playstation,35qts1,xwatchmanx,2,Wed May 13 17:57:37 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure he should have known. As soon as they said, ""You're going to be playing a Wii U"" any rational person would have said, ""Hmm, I wonder if my main paying gig at Sony, who make the competing Playstation 4 of which I'm the comical face of the company would get mad""  Most people would go through that scenario and end up with, ""Yep, they're going to be pissed, better not do this."""
playstation,35qts1,VA1N,0,Wed May 13 18:05:25 2015 UTC,You have a copy of his contract?
