ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,m1ntberrycrunchh,6,Tue Jul 21 04:19:05 2015 UTC,I would say it's pretty unlikely that any of them play up barring a trade that clears out on of the Avs' one-way NHL contracts. It doesn't do Bigras or Rantanen or Hishon any good to play a handful of minutes per night when they could be playing top minutes in all situations in the AHL. that's the proper way to develop those guys.
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,canucklehead272,4,Tue Jul 21 14:31:21 2015 UTC,"It could be really useful to play Rantanen for his 9 allowed games though. Getting NHL experience would be huge for him. After those 9 games, send him back to the AHL. It would also probably push Mitchell in that 4th line centre position for those 9 games which could give Winchester even more time to recover."
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,ZeArcadeAcadian,4,Tue Jul 21 15:05:05 2015 UTC,"9 games is fine. Long term he should probably play a full year in the AHL. Unless he's somehow ready for top 6 minutes, which he probably isn't."
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,slobbergob,3,Tue Jul 21 15:12:08 2015 UTC,"Well first, Rantanen is a winger. So what he has to do with Mitchell as the 3C or Winchester as the 4C I don't understand (unless you had Mitchell as a 3W i guess?). 2nd Winchester has missed a full year of hockey why is 9 additional games some magic number that helps him out?  As for Rantanen. There's a reason that teams very rarely exercise the 9 game option on ELC's and never do it when they know they aren't keeping the player up for the whole year. Playing an 18 year old on a 9 game tryout is bad for development.  What happens if Rantanen predictably struggles in his first 9 games on North American ice in the most competitive league in the world? Then he goes back to the AHL disappointed and without the confidence that you want your top prospect to have entering the season.    What happens if he comes up and plays well and the Avs demote him anyway to prevent burning a year of his ELC? The Rantanen might head back to the AHL playing well, but upset with the organization because he feels like they didnt give him a real chance to stick in the NHL.  Maybe then he takes the AHL lightly, maybe he works his butt off to come back, maybe it sucks all the wind out of his sails and he loses all his confidence, maybe he gets pissed and demands to play over seas instead?  Does that sound ridiculous? It shouldn't, because right here on the Avs roster we have Grigorenko, the perfect example of why playing a guy in the NHL before he's ready is a dangerous move that can hamper his development for years to come.  On top of all that, what kind of message does it send to the rest of your roster to say ""Hey this kid isn't good enough to stay and we wont have him all year, but.... You have to sit 10% of the season anyway so that he can get some experience""  The 9 game option is used very, very rarely. If he's ready play him and if he's not, develop him in the A for the full season."
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,canucklehead272,2,Tue Jul 21 19:12:10 2015 UTC,"First, Rantanen taking a wing position would put Grigorenko in the centre position thereby putting Mitchell on the 4th.   2nd, Rantanen is one of the few players in this past draft that always had a shot at cracking an NHL roster on opening day. The 9 NHL games are helpful to see if he can live up to that and also give him some experience playing in the best league in the world that he will inevitably play in.   Last, this is the best league in the world. Players know that business is business. It really wouldn't hurt Winchester to slowly bring him back into the lineup, especially being injured for a year."
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,ZeArcadeAcadian,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:40:34 2015 UTC,The nine game rule only applies to players sent back to their junior team or club overseas. A year is still burned on his contract if he plays in the AHL.
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,olaftheviking,4,Tue Jul 21 15:45:07 2015 UTC,"Check again, playing in the AHL does not burn a year of his ELC"
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,canucklehead272,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:00:06 2015 UTC,If rantanen gets sent down he will be heading back to Finland not the ahl
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,PatchesOHoulihan86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:46 2015 UTC,He can go to either place without burning his ELC
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,canucklehead272,4,Tue Jul 21 16:24:28 2015 UTC,I think Bigras has a good chance to start on the 3rd pair with Stuart.   Rantanen will likely at least play the in 9 games and then they will make a decision.   Hishon will either start at center on the 4th line or be a healthy scratch. But I don't see him being sent to the AHL.
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,Hamburglar15,3,Tue Jul 21 04:29:10 2015 UTC,"Holden has a 3 year one way contract, he'll have that bottom pairing slot. Bigras is also not a bottom pairing guy, you won't see his skill set there. No point in bringing him up until Beauchemin gets pushed to the 3rd line in two years.  The rest I agree with."
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,ZeArcadeAcadian,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:33:37 2015 UTC,"He played well on the Wing, he might get moved to wing* if Bigras is ready."
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,Subject2Change,2,Tue Jul 21 14:51:58 2015 UTC,He was awful on the wing. Dude contributed basically nothing
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,canucklehead272,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:59:17 2015 UTC,"Which line though? Also, it wouldn't help Bigras to play bottom pairing minutes. Holden can't just jump into centre, the wing maybe. But then who would you drop for him to play on the wing? McLeod or Everberg?"
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,ZeArcadeAcadian,2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:02 2015 UTC,McLeod or Bordy.
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,Subject2Change,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:38 2015 UTC,"Bordy is done. McLeod has the 'A' so he won't lose his spot as long as he has it.  I actually hope McLeod is done with the Avs after this season. Give the 'A' to Dutchy, Johnson, or honestly MacKinnon (seems to be a great character around the dressing room and handled being demoted last year for a brief time really well)"

ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,justVisitingAgain,2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:47 2015 UTC,Holden played wing a few games last season.
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,Subject2Change,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:19 2015 UTC,All of these scenarios are really bad for individual player development.
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,canucklehead272,5,Tue Jul 21 14:32:29 2015 UTC,How is having Rantanen play 9 games bad for development?
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,ZeArcadeAcadian,4,Tue Jul 21 14:40:45 2015 UTC,Hope Bigras makes it but wouldn't mind giving him more time to develop. Works wonders for the Red Wings. Same with Rantanen. He's big but needs more weight to go with his frame.
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,originalsoul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:40:09 2015 UTC,"I think at worst Hishon will be splitting time with winchester on the 4th line. Bigras has a real chance to make the third pair this year but it will all depend on his camp, even if he doesn't make it he should be first injury call up. Rantanen is in a bit of a weird spot. Before july first I would have said he most likely makes the team but now we have Comeau and Grigs taking up third line spots. I still think Rantanen should be starting over Mcleod but I doubt Sak/Roy see it that way."
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,Rudo3,2,Tue Jul 21 06:07:26 2015 UTC,"Siemens, Bigras and Rantanen are the most likely. Hishon too if you count him as a prospect.   I don't think any of them stick with the club, but if I had to guess, I'd say Siemens and Rantanen.   Bigras is going to get tons of playing time in SA, as well as Geersten hopefully, so having Siemens graduate would be awesome. If not one of these three losses a good chunk of their needed playing time."
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,slobbergob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:29 2015 UTC,It would probably be Geersten. Bigras and Siemens as a top AHL pairing is pretty solid.
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,ZeArcadeAcadian,2,Tue Jul 21 14:43:26 2015 UTC,"They're both LHD, so in theory you'd have Bigras and Siemens as your top 4 left hand D's, playing with whomever we have on the right side down there (Gervais and Noreau I think).  That would force Geersten into 3rd pairing minutes which probably wouldn't be as beneficial as top 4. If Siemens was to graduate, that would really help us out in that aspect. Although then you have to do something with the other guys (Guenin, Holden, Redmond, etc).   This is part of the reason having so many poor guys signed to contracts is terrible."
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,slobbergob,2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:40 2015 UTC,"I didn't even think about their handedness, good point. I think it would probably be worth playing Geersten on his opposite side if that's the case.   There simply is no room for them to graduate. Plus it would be really good to get Siemens on another really low cost contract again next year which is likely if he doesn't play in the NHL."
ColoradoAvalanche,3e17vo,ZeArcadeAcadian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:17:23 2015 UTC,"Siemens is on an ELC. If it doesn't slide again next year, it'll just be year 1. He's cost controlled for a long time yet."

ColoradoAvalanche,3dym2u,chenac,3,Mon Jul 20 16:24:12 2015 UTC,Does anyone else feel like preseason tickets are really overpriced?
ColoradoAvalanche,3dym2u,rwh151,5,Mon Jul 20 17:34:37 2015 UTC,"Looks like they're charging regular season prices for the preseason games.  I checked in my section for one seat and what they're asking is $2 less than regular season price.  Luckily my season ticket included the preseason games for free.  I'd say wait until the day of or day before and you may find some cheaper on Flashseats or Stubhub.  Since season ticket holders get the games for free, some of the STH may just throw their tix for those games on Flashseats for dirt cheap since they didn't have to purchase them as well."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dym2u,vliegs,2,Mon Jul 20 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're free. I did the math and we're charged for 43 games:  40 regular season (normally 41, minus Stadium Series this year) plus 3 pre-season games.  So technically, they're full price."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dym2u,pilipinopapi,3,Mon Jul 20 18:07:09 2015 UTC,"My bad, I did the math from my invoice for the renewal and you're right, they did charge for pre-season games as well.  That's really odd since last year I was given the pre-season games for free, the ticketing agent I was working with made a point of emphasizing that fact.  I wonder if it was just a new season ticket holder perk?"
ColoradoAvalanche,3dym2u,vliegs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:50:42 2015 UTC,"It may have been free last year (not sure now) but they're starting to jack up prices.  The more success they have, they more they'll charge. I'm sure when they win the Cup, the season ticket prices will be back up to full general admission price, esp if they get the sell-out streak going again."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dym2u,pilipinopapi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:14:21 2015 UTC,Yeah. My main problem is that they are a lot harder to find on anything but the box office. I'll check flashseats though thanks!

ColoradoAvalanche,3dnf3e,slobbergob,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:54:35 2015 UTC,"No. Closer to 3/4 of it. His line consistently get dominated in almost every aspect. It's weird to say about a 4th liner, but he's probably our most overrated player."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dnf3e,AvsFanInSTL,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:22 2015 UTC,"I will say he'll be a 3rd liner, but can fill holes as needed (maybe a 2nd liner). I'm really excited about Comeau. My roommate is a Pens fan and he seems to have great things to say about the guy last season. I honestly think he could play on our 2nd line, but won't start there due to our current players. If I had to guess I would say our top three lines would look something like this:   Tanguay-Duchene-Iginla   Landeskog-Soderberg-MacKinnon (or vise versa on Soderberg & MacKinnon)   Comeau-Mitchell-Grigorenko (or vise versa on Mitchell & Grigorenko since Grigorenko is listed as a center)   OP: what line did he play on last season and how did you like his game play?"
ColoradoAvalanche,3dmhco,alphase7en,10,Fri Jul 17 13:49:34 2015 UTC,1 for 1 sounds like if you have 2 season tickets you'll be able to buy 2 outdoor game tickets.
ColoradoAvalanche,3dmhco,Bosco_Sauce,4,Fri Jul 17 14:56:21 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly, I think that's what 1 for 1 means..."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dmhco,JudeauWork,3,Fri Jul 17 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe 2 for 1 is a better way to put it.  Even with season tickets, the outdoor game is not included. So I have the ability to purchase 2 tickets (for my season tickets) and then 2 additional tickets guaranteed."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dmhco,hippieguy1,4,Fri Jul 17 16:35:21 2015 UTC,I have a twenty game pack and also talked to my ticket rep this week. He said at this point they are not anticipating having a general sale to the public. He also said tickets will range in price from 50.00-400.00 for those that have access to buy them. My game pack gets me access to but tickets for the stadium game but only after season ticket holders. I did not ask how many they can buy.
ColoradoAvalanche,3dmhco,Subject2Change,4,Fri Jul 17 15:15:53 2015 UTC,"They really expect to sell out 50,000 tickets to an outdoor game? The games in NY people were literally giving tickets away to see the Rags/Islanders....this is coming from a population of 8 million.  I highly doubt it's going to sell out as I'll be extremely pissed if I can't get tickets to the game, as I plan to fly out there for the weekend to see the Avs play the sharks at the Pepsi Center as well..."

We did come down under from time to time, and honestly... it would have been sick to meet up with more fans overseas.   If you only saw him last month, chances are that the G Dub is still out at sea. Not sure how their network is (on the Essex, you'd be lucky to get even a minute of good internet at sea) but odds are that he probably won't be in touch with you until the end of his patrol, which could vary anywhere between a day and a few months."

ColoradoAvalanche,3dl1cx,Joevahskank,4,Fri Jul 17 07:22:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah they're based out of Yokosuka, Japan (just outside Toyko). I was based out of Sasebo, a little ways further south-west from there. The ships would link up once in a while, but generally speaking the carrier group was separate from the amphib group  One of the big things about connectivity is that it's command based more than it's tech based. They certainly have the capabilities, but due to Operational Security and several other communication hazards (such as radio overlap or dropped calls) many commands opt to devote more resources to essential tasks rather than onboard wifi.   I remember trying to call home on one of the phones. There was (what seemed to be) a minute delay between messages while at sea, so you would say one thing, then wait a while, and they would finally receive it. Obviously the calls were monitored, but that's just a glimpse of how serious a command takes privacy and OPSEC"

ColoradoAvalanche,3djq70,concussed_cowboy,4,Thu Jul 16 21:01:59 2015 UTC,I wouldn't have minded a longer deal. But I definitely think this is best for both sides. I believe in this guy and am excited to see him play
ColoradoAvalanche,3djq70,seaseme,2,Thu Jul 16 21:03:33 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't have minded a longer deal, but he needs to convince us. The last thing we need is another parenteau or briere situation again. We really REALLY don't need another talented forward on an expensive contract riding the pine.   This should light a fire under his ass, because otherwise his career might fizzle out before it even starts.   Also he's an RFA at the end, so maybe we get a sweet team friendly bridge deal out of him next off season."
ColoradoAvalanche,3djq70,Assumer,6,Thu Jul 16 22:14:59 2015 UTC,"There's a chance Roy is going to transform Grigorenko, and this is the perfect contract for that. I had high hopes for him in Buffalo but he was very underwhelming outside the Q."
ColoradoAvalanche,3djq70,slobbergob,5,Thu Jul 16 22:05:31 2015 UTC,"Dater reported it's a 1 year, 1 way contract at 675 K. Which is great."

Buffalo rushed the hell out of him, throwing him to the wolves on a terrible team for two years, killing his confidence and hurting his development.  Roy coached in the QMJHL, got a lot out of the kid, and can certainly do so again.  He has stated numerous times how well he got along with and liked Roy, and many fully anticipate this kid pulling it together on a much better team with much better line mates and Coach Roy who knows him very well."

ColoradoAvalanche,3djq70,TheRobotSpy,2,Thu Jul 16 21:37:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, rules are 27 Years old or 7 Years NHL experience to become UFA.  He is only 21."

ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,concussed_cowboy,10,Thu Jul 16 01:28:34 2015 UTC,"Good job, i think we did Improve in our stock this season and addressed what we needed. Last season, we were trying to get into damage control after losing Stastny to Free Agency and signed whatever pieces we could get. Also, I really do think that Injuries took a toll on us last season, with being 2nd only to the Blue Jackets in Man Games Loss. This season is going to be a good one for us and I really do think that we could slip into the playoffs with this group of guys we have going into the season. Like the last few season, the Central Division is going to be a unpredictable division.  Little off point, but when did the Atlantic and Metropolitan Division get 9 teams and Pacific 8 Teams?"
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,Pikachu1989,4,Thu Jul 16 02:17:38 2015 UTC,I had 9 and 8 teams IF you added the Avs in those divisions to show how they would fair compared to the entire division so I probably worded that poorly.  But yes I agree 100%. It'll always be tough in the Central Division but I'm very excited for what's to come

ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,rwh151,6,Thu Jul 16 02:23:49 2015 UTC,Good write up. I think we got a lot deeper and if we stay healthy we have a shot at playoffs. Our division is tough so nothing is a lock.
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,rwh151,3,Thu Jul 16 01:45:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I agree, but I do think behind Dallas we improved over all the other teams in the division. But we will see, still going to be the toughest division in the league"
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,rwh151,2,Thu Jul 16 01:51:32 2015 UTC,Nashville didn't lose much. St. Louis is a little more balanced. Winnepeg could be scary. Chicago is still chicago so don't count them out.

ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,ZeArcadeAcadian,3,Thu Jul 16 02:23:10 2015 UTC,I think Nashville is the biggest fish in the division right now.

ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,Subject2Change,3,Thu Jul 16 18:12:16 2015 UTC,"A little too optimistic IMO and wayyyy too much blame for injuries. The Avs made it 60 games into the season and had lost 2 total games from their Top 6 forwards. That's incredibly good fortune and unlikely to repeat. The Avs' injury issues last season are HUGELY overblown by fans and publicly by the front office as well. This team while healthy wasn't good enough to compete, that's the simple truth.   When EJ went down at the all star break the Avs had been remarkably lucky in terms of injuries, and they were already down to below a 5% chance at the playoffs."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,canucklehead272,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:32:57 2015 UTC,"Not really.. At least IMO. Before JOhnson went down Varly had already been hurt three times and we already lost three forwardsfor the entire season.. We lost way over 250 man games... That's insane. We were second most in the league.   Injuries are always going to happen that's just part of the game, but to that extent. Last year was extreme. I think a case could be made that they were practically always missing a key piece at some point last year.   Regardless the numbers dont lie, even with over 250 man games lost and playing in the toughest division we were 7 points out of the playoffs."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,TurtleMountain,5,Thu Jul 16 17:37:26 2015 UTC,"Numbers don't lie but numbers don't say anything without context either. 250 man games is a lot. No doubt. 81 of them came from Patrick Bordeleau, who numbers say makes the team worse every moment he's on the is. So already we're down to 169 ""meaningful"" man games lost. Winchester wasn't a loss compared to the previous year (and is a 4th liner anyway) because he was new so now we're down to just 87 games from roster regulars. That's... Not much  If a team can't withstand losing two 4th liners and Jamie McGinn (a 3rd liner) then I'd say they're a pretty shit team, and that's what the Avs were in the first 50 games of the season. Healthy, and awful.   As for Varlamov, his time out was short and Pickard put up better numbers than Varlamov had averaged to that point in the year. So yes he's an important player who was hurt earlier, but his SV% was directly replaced and even improved on during his first half absence and the team in front of Picks still couldn't win games.   Edit: in fact the Avs first half in 2013-2014 was WORSE in terms of injuries. They lost 2 top 6 wingers for extended stretches (PAP and Tanguay) compared to losing McGinn, Bordeleau, and Winchester."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,fthflyer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:49:29 2015 UTC,"I'll give you Bordy. BUt when you bring in Winchester as someone to help replace what you lost in the offseason and he can't suit up a single game I can't that as just as much of a loss. At the start of the season they were counting on him to provide some support and he couldn't.  McGinn is yes primarily a third liner but has given us a lot of valuable minutes as a top 6 guy.  One of our biggest issues, at leas IMO that doesn't get talked about much around here is depth. We had absolutely no depth last year it felt like. I think they did a lot better job getting that depth for this coming season.  A case could be mad that if Johnson and Mack don't miss significant time we could have made a push for the playoffs."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,Subject2Change,11,Thu Jul 16 17:53:48 2015 UTC,"I skimmed the parts after saying Hejda won't be a big loss.  He's a huge loss.  For most of the season, Hejda was our 3rd best defenseman after EJ and Barrie.  He played top line minutes and he rarely struggled.  I think he still has some games left in him.  He would be an upgrade to our bottom pairing.  Beauchemin is a good answer to replace Hejda, but I don't think you can dismiss Hejda so easily.  EDIT: Don't downvote other people's opinions. People undervalued Stastny leaving last season. I think OP and most of the rest of the sub is undervaluing Hejda.  It was time to move on to younger players, but he sure as hell will be missed."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,ZeArcadeAcadian,10,Thu Jul 16 01:58:21 2015 UTC,"Hejda is a perfectly serviceable defenseman.  He isn't going to lose you many games, but he probably isn't going to win you any games either.  Johnson, Barrie, Zadurov, Beauchemin round out the top 4.  Maybe Bigras makes the roster?  Maybe Siemens?  We couldn't justify spending the money for an aging dman who played pretty average at best last season.  Better to focus that money towards contracts with EJ, Barrie, and MacKinnon."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,ZeArcadeAcadian,5,Thu Jul 16 03:56:10 2015 UTC,"Agree it was time to move on, but Hejda for 1 year wouldn't affect the EJ, Barrie, and MacKinnon extensions."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,TurtleMountain,8,Fri Jul 17 03:41:36 2015 UTC,He's a bottom line pairing dman. He struggled a lot at times last year. He is an upgrade to our bottom pairing but he was pretty average last year  I think you should read the rest of the write-up
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,rwh151,8,Thu Jul 16 02:02:03 2015 UTC,Beauch will replace him and more. The fact that no one signed him or wanted him at the deadline should be telling.
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,ZeArcadeAcadian,3,Thu Jul 16 02:22:52 2015 UTC,"Hejda would of been great if we didn't have an abundance of depth D.   Right now our top 4 is EJ, Zads, Beau and Barrie. 5 is Stuart and 6th spot will be Guenin, Holden and Redmond."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,HoboWithANerfGun,5,Thu Jul 16 19:02:21 2015 UTC,Beauchemin is better than Hejda and replaces Hejda in his exact spot. Clear night and day upgrade. He won't be missed.
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,fthflyer,4,Thu Jul 16 17:28:26 2015 UTC,"Doesn't mean that he won't be missed outside of the top pairing.  I would take him over Stuart, Holden, Guenin, and Redmond with very little hesitation."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,fthflyer,2,Fri Jul 17 03:42:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, man. At least Hejda was consitently healthy. He missed like 3 games in his tenure with the Avs. Not flashy, but he played top minutes for the Avs most nights and he never seemed like a liability.  I really liked Hejda"
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,fthflyer,2,Thu Jul 16 17:50:03 2015 UTC,"I think you failed to see the brilliance in the PA trade, PA failed in Montreal as well; coaches have an issue with him. We lost 4 million off of our cap hit this season. Do I think PA would of been good in Colorado? Probably, but it doesn't matter if the Coaches can't work with him. Briere's retirement seemed imminent and that was why we went after him, hopefully he had some locker room presence.   Stuart was thrown in an awkward situation, as an aging Vet D-Man he is not meant to play top 2 minutes but due to our lack of D he was put into a bad situation, a situation that the Avs organization felt would be better suited to a Vet D-man to experience rather than an inexperienced up and comer. I think Stuart on the 3rd line with Guenin/Holden/Redmond is going to be HUGE for the development of those young guys.  I wasn't very optimistic going into last season, however this season with the addition of 2 solid D-men and some restructuring, I am fairly positive will be making the playoffs. I see the both the Wild and the Jets missing it this year and us and the Stars making it to at the very least the 1st round."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,fthflyer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:56:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with that. I think The PA trade was shitty for everyone, but yes at the very least we cleared $4M in cap. I've been saying it all along that I think the Jets will miss the playoffs, not sure about the Wild I could see them going either way. I feel like there season last year was a lot like ours two years ago. Got real hot for a stretch and pretty much rode Dubnyk into the playoffs"
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,Matute97,4,Thu Jul 16 19:04:47 2015 UTC,"A few things...  First, Rantanen doesn't have an amazing shot. In fact, the two things every scout said about him was that his shot needs major improvements and that he doesn't utilize his size enough.  Second, the only reason Hejda leaving is a good thing is because we already have Stuart. I would much rather have Hejda on the third line than him, especially when you consider the differences in cap hit.  Third, (This will get major criticism) we still aren't a playoff team yet. Yes, we should be one of the top 16 teams in the league, but given the fact that we are still in the Central, it looks like the only teams we might be able to beat in that division are Dallas and Winnipeg. If Dubnyk plays like he did this past year, Minny will be too good. St Louis, Chicago, and Nashville are probably the three most complete teams with Nashville falling slightly due to their overachieving offence last year. We need to be in the top 5 of these teams. Chicago, St Louis, Nashville, Minny are pretty solid locks. Which means we need to beat out Winnipeg and Dallas for that spot. Dallas upgraded everything, which is scary. Winnipeg will be our closest competitors.   Last, I'm not saying there is no hope. The fact that we had the 2nd most injuries last year makes this upcoming year a mystery. We'll see what happens.  P.S. I agree with u/TurtleMountain that down voting someone for expressing an opinion on a post that was completely opinion oriented is really dumb. Then again, who really cares about Reddit scores/karma."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,hybridtheorist,4,Thu Jul 16 12:54:55 2015 UTC,"It's Reddit, who really cares about Karma.  Second though. The fact that not a single team has expressed any interest in Hejda while he's been a FA even to be a third pairing guy should tell you something. I liked HEjda and he did give us some valuable minutes the few years while he was here but it's time for him to hang it up.I think it's a case that we all just like him more than he's that good.  Third, that entire post is my explanation why I think we will be a playoff team (obviously). BUt we played in the toughest division and had the second most man games lost in league and most of them were by very valuable players, and we still barley missed the playoff. That being said I don't think we're as good or as complete as Nashville or Chicago but I personally think we can be every bit as good as Minny and Dallas and Winnipeg."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dgc8i,OJtuna,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:01:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with the karma thing. It's dumb, who cares. The issue is, after hitting -5 your opinion is deleted, which defeats the purpose of reddit. Down voting should only be exercised when people are trolling."
ColoradoAvalanche,3dfne3,rwh151,10,Wed Jul 15 22:08:46 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that it will still be blacked out.  EDIT: Found this that explains it a bit http://www.broadstreethockey.com/2015/6/15/8783249/nhl-tv-settlement-settlement-game-center-live    Are blackout restrictions still in effect?  Yes, of course. Just like with NHL Center Ice or NHL GameCenter Live today, the new package will black out games that are available to you locally or are on national television.  So again, using my personal example as a Flyers fan living in Washington, D.C. ... if the Flyers are playing the local team, the Capitals, that game will be blacked out via the package I paid $105 for and I will be forced to watch on the local channel, which means I'm forced to subscribe to cable or satellite. Same deal if the Flyers game is on national TV -- NBC Sports Network, NHL Network or NBC. I will need to watch it there, as it will be blacked out on the package I paid $105 for."

ColoradoAvalanche,3d94cv,bmanCO,9,Tue Jul 14 13:49:21 2015 UTC,A one year mercenary on defense really might not be the worst thing to bridge the gap between now and Siemens/Bigras. It really can't hurt as long as we have the money free during the next offseason.
ColoradoAvalanche,3d94cv,seaseme,8,Tue Jul 14 19:56:36 2015 UTC,"I LOVE this way of thinking about it. This could be amazing. It would suck to have to figure out who to send down, but this would be an amazing stop-gap between now and Bigras/Siemens being ready."
ColoradoAvalanche,3d94cv,Bosco_Sauce,2,Tue Jul 14 20:12:46 2015 UTC,It would suck to have to figure out who to send down   That's a much better problem than having too much AHL talent at the top. :-D

ColoradoAvalanche,3d94cv,warka10,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:47:29 2015 UTC,"I know this is a relatively risk-free signing seeing how its a one-year contract for a reputable player that we could probably snag for $1-3mil, but it seems as if Sakic is looking for more long-term commitment type of players that the younger guys can benefit from in the long run.   Not saying it's a bad thought, just wondering how Sakic stands on the short-term contract players."
ColoradoAvalanche,3d94cv,INSERTx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:07:21 2015 UTC,I don't think management would fork over the money. We already have too many guys on 1 way contracts so it would be whatever they sign him for plus the extra money paying a guy NHL money to play in the AHL. How much payoff would we actually get from him?
ColoradoAvalanche,3d94cv,seaseme,5,Tue Jul 14 19:13:39 2015 UTC,"What's to lose? we could easily afford a 1yr/3m contract for him, might be really interesting."
ColoradoAvalanche,3d94cv,INSERTx,2,Tue Jul 14 20:11:56 2015 UTC,There's nothing to loose for sure but that's not my point. We're looking at him playing some not very huge minutes. Is it worth paying him the money is the question. I dont think the benefit would be worth the price tag.
ColoradoAvalanche,3d94cv,INSERTx,2,Tue Jul 14 21:19:00 2015 UTC,"But its not your money so the money itself should mean nothing to you.  As long as they dont screw themselves with the cap situation (which 1 year wouldn't) then the money is irrelevant.    They currently have roughly 9.5 million to get to the ceiling. I wouldn't care if they gave him 7 million (figuratively, as he's not worth that) cause its not my money."
ColoradoAvalanche,3d94cv,INSERTx,2,Tue Jul 14 21:29:44 2015 UTC,This has nothing to do with cap space at all. I'm talking about whether or not its worth the owner shelling out like 3-4 mil for a guy we're likely going to give like 10-15 minutes of playing time. We also have a ton of roster guys on 1 way contract so we'd be paying them NHL money to play in the AHL. How much will his addition help our team with the little amount he would play.  There's a lot more too it than salary cap room.
ColoradoAvalanche,3d94cv,Bosco_Sauce,3,Tue Jul 14 21:50:45 2015 UTC,"Why do you care about the owners money??  That's my point.  I have never and will never care about Stan's pocket book, and Ehrhoff is an obvious upgrade on at least 2 of our top 6, so as a fan you should be advocating them spending the money and cap space to improve the team.    Stan Kroenke is a multi billionaire who owns multiple sports franchises.  1 year of Ehrhoff will be insignificant to him at the end of the day."
ColoradoAvalanche,3d94cv,Bosco_Sauce,3,Tue Jul 14 22:00:27 2015 UTC,"I don't give a flying fuck about his money, but he does. You don't get money like that by spending a bunch of unnecessary money is what I'm saying. I would love have erhoff on the team and put put Stuart in the press box. I'm just saying I can't see it actually happening because the price tag probably doesn't match the benefit the team gets for this 1 year."

ColoradoAvalanche,3d4pv7,slobbergob,4,Mon Jul 13 14:38:54 2015 UTC,MHH podcasts are always great but if you want some closure and/or want to listen to some smart hockey people tie in the moves of the offseason then this is the perfect podcast for any true Avs fan.   These guys actually watch the camps and analyze the players on a meaningful level unlike a lot of certain statewide and national publications  MHH and BSN should be every Avs fans go to source
ColoradoAvalanche,3d4pv7,seancolorado,2,Mon Jul 13 17:45:14 2015 UTC,Can anyone compare this to The Avs Hockey Podcast? Really like these guys but their output dropped a little last year when one of them left denver.   http://www.avshockeypodcast.com/
ColoradoAvalanche,3d4pv7,Chris_sI984,3,Mon Jul 13 19:29:00 2015 UTC,"I've listened to that before, and it seemed good. I only listened to maybe 1 or 2 episodes, but I've listened to every MHH podcast and as far as Avs podcasts go (which there is like 3), they really take the cake. Even if you don't agree with what they're saying, they at least lay out reasons for their opinions and such.  The guys are well informed and I believe the BSN guys actually have press credentials, so there's at least one more Avs news source out there which is great for everyone."

ColoradoAvalanche,3d3xqb,lucrat,2,Mon Jul 13 19:33:20 2015 UTC,Don't know full details yet but I do know they are giving priority to season ticket holders then to game plan holders (like the 14 game packs) before they are available to the general public. I'm sure the NHL will take a cut of the available seats as well. More information is supposed to be out in August I believe.
ColoradoAvalanche,3d3xqb,Govt_mule,2,Mon Jul 13 12:56:57 2015 UTC,"The NHL takes all the seats and gives a cut back to the team. It is an NHL event not an Avs home game. (according to the Rules it is a Home game, but not for business purposes) If you have a relationship with a sponsor, use it.  I have been to 2 outdoor games. At the first one the visiting team STHs got some access as well, but that was the Winter Classic and it was at a football stadium, and thus there were a great deal more tickets to sell. (Pittsburgh)  The second one was at a baseball stadium and the baseball STHs got access to tickets as well, but it was part of the deal to use the venue. I understand this has not been the case elsewhere. I have Rockies Season Tickets and we have not heard anything about access to seats. (Washington)  I received the same email as Alphase7en."

ColoradoAvalanche,3d3m5p,AwesomeMcG,3,Mon Jul 13 06:39:34 2015 UTC,"It would seem as though single game tickets are not yet on sale, so what's available is more than likely season ticket holders putting theirs up for resale.

ColoradoAvalanche,3d30cy,Nezirsc,4,Mon Jul 13 03:17:00 2015 UTC,"I was in the same quandary, but I'm glad I went for the Club level because of the following reasons:    get into the Can 1/2 hour before others (maybe you can do that on the lower level too) faster lines for concessions - no waiting forever like in the madness that's on the 100 level, same with the bathrooms bar area that's great to hang out in, and talk with other fans personal server for each section so you don't have to leave your seat to wait in line for drinks (although this service is more expensive, and personally, I would not recommend any of the options on the food menu in those sections - the food was expensive and didn't taste that good) the joy of riding up the VIP escalator and being personally greeted by the security people (but they knew me because they saw me often before and after each game, plus, I'm friendly) access to better food in the Can on the Club level -outside of your section- but access to food on other levels as well more famous people/players sit in the Club level and/or in suites accessible by that level (yes, I bumped into a few) only downside: I was one of the few regulars in my section, because many companies buy group tickets for their employees and clients. So even though people would wear jerseys to games and sit in seats on the Club level, they weren't the biggest fans of the game. As a result, I surprisingly toned down my fan-ness and stopped yelling as much as I used to do when I sat in the 300 level or the 100 level. Many ""suits"", but they appreciated my knowledge of the sport (I guided so many through the rules, players on the teams, stats and such). For a fun ride with awesome fans, get season tickets in Mt. Loud.    Having stated these benefits and drawbacks, I had 100-level seats for the playoffs and was amazed at being so up-close to the action. But there were times I couldn't see everything because of the angle (I was able to figure out plays better from sitting above in the Club level). When I first decided to get season tickets, I told a colleague who said, ""Oh, when you go Club, you'll never go back to anything else."" I'm surprised that I really agree with him."
ColoradoAvalanche,3d30cy,totosmaster,2,Mon Jul 13 03:36:20 2015 UTC,Yeah I think you guys sold me. Its the same price and you get a hell of a lot more without really giving anything up.

ColoradoAvalanche,3d0k77,butchvig,5,Sun Jul 12 14:21:51 2015 UTC,"What makes this a team issued jersey?  First of all, it is pretty easy to identify the inaugural 1995-96 Avalanche jerseys. This was the only year that the ""boxed"" Starter logo was used on the back lower hem.  In what is probably the largest gap between an Avalanche retail authentic and a gamer, the retail authentic jerseys made in 1995-96 are significantly different from what was actually worn on the ice. This can probably be chalked up to the rush job that comes with a relocation and a complete uniform redesign.   Larger Avalanche crest titled counter-clockwise (similar 1996-97 Avs gamers) A different Yetti foot logo shoulder patch - interestingly, its the same patch that was used on CCM replicas 1995-2007. A consumer friendly blue tag in place of where the white and black size tag was on game worn jerseys. Retail Authentics were made in El Salavdor; Gamers were made in Berlin, WI Thicker bottom color on collar (blue on white jersey, white on team color jersey)   1995-96 Retail Authentic Pic: http://anyonebutdetroit.com/images/stories/1996_retail_auth.jpg"

ColoradoAvalanche,3cshbv,beaverskeet,5,Fri Jul 10 12:19:29 2015 UTC,"Soderberg, Beauchemin, Comeau, Zadorov, Grigorenko, and Rantanen if he has an awesome camp.   The good thing is he can play in the AHL, so he's only a phone call away if an extended injury happens. I doubt they'll call him up for a few games here or there so it would have to be a long term thing."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cshbv,slobbergob,4,Fri Jul 10 14:00:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think I'd prefer if we just let Rantanen continue playing in Europe for another season. There's no sense rushing a 10th pick into playing if he isn't ready for it. ROR was a huge anomaly; most young players, if they aren't in the top 3-4 picks, just aren't quite ready for the NHL."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cshbv,Fozefy,3,Fri Jul 10 16:17:53 2015 UTC,"Why Finland though? TPS is a terrible team and I think it would benefit him, and our other prospects, if he played in the AHL. San Antonio probably isn't going to win the Calder or anything, but they look to be a competitive team, especially on defense.   Let him come here and get better acclimated to NA and let the Avs keep a closer eye on him. The only hitch is the mandatory service that Finnish people have to go through, but I'm sure that can be worked out in the summer."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cshbv,slobbergob,3,Fri Jul 10 17:11:37 2015 UTC,"Two benefits to Finland, I believe. He can get his service done in one go rather than spread out over multiple summers, AND he won't lose a year on his entry-level deal the way he would if he played in the AHL. This would obviously mean a lesser cap hit for one year more when actually on the team."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cshbv,asmodeanreborn,2,Fri Jul 10 17:37:42 2015 UTC,"We don't lose a year on his entry level deal. I asked this question yesterday and got that answer, as well as did my own research.   You lose it if he plays 10 NHL games, or hits a certain age. Neither of which will happen this year most likely.   It's really only the Military service, and they often take into account that these kids are athletes in foreign countries. They'll usually be allowed to work through it during summer, or they'll work with him as best they can.  Nylander played in the AHL last year and his contract slid."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cshbv,slobbergob,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:40:32 2015 UTC,"Nylander played in the AHL last year and his contract slid.     I think there's other weirdness that comes into place if you don't even enter the NHL, though, and there's a reason he only played 37 games + played in Sweden too, though I believe that has to do with burning off years until UFA (the limit is 40 games, I think).    As for the military service - yeah, he can do it over multiple summers like some others have. I just pointed out that it's preferable getting it over with in one go so he can focus on real off-season training every future season instead."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cshbv,asmodeanreborn,3,Fri Jul 10 19:00:28 2015 UTC,"It doesn't though. Anisimov also played in the AHL a full year and his contract slid.   If we play Rantanen in SA all year, and he doesn't hit 10 NHL games, his contract will slide.   So there's no real reason he can't come to the AHL. Military service is one thing, but I don't see anything else that would persuade Roy and Sakic against bringing him."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cshbv,slobbergob,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:02:59 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah, you're indeed right. But it does look like if he's not ready for NHL next season either, playing in the AHL this season AND next would use a year on his entry level, just like it did for Anisimov (all AHL the first season, a single NHL game the second one and a year ""lost)."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cshbv,asmodeanreborn,2,Fri Jul 10 20:29:01 2015 UTC,Rantanen was the closest 'NHL ready' prospect available at this draft after McDavid and Eichel. He's big and he's already accustomed to play against men. The only thing that could stand against him playing in the NHL this season is if he's having a bad training camp
ColoradoAvalanche,3cshbv,fred9131,3,Sat Jul 11 03:40:36 2015 UTC,"That seems a little bit of a dramatization.  Crouse, Hanifin, and perhaps Provorov are more NHL ready.  You'll gawk at Crouse's name being mentioned, but he has all the necessary traits to be a solid 3rd or 4th liner today."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cshbv,TurtleMountain,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:16:45 2015 UTC,"I know he's AHL eligible, but I believe I read somewhere that Sakic has already said if he doesn't make the Avs he'll go back to Finland for the coming season."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cshbv,hotfudgemonday,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:50:44 2015 UTC,"He did say that, but Roy has said he could go either place, plus Sakic mentioned after he drafted him that one of the perks was that he could play in the AHL.   I saw the interview where he says ""back to Finland"" and it kind of sounded like he didn't mean specifically Finland."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cshbv,slobbergob,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:09:35 2015 UTC,"Seems to me the AHL would be the best option. He's already proven he can play vs. men, but a year getting acclimated to the North American rink/game will only help his development."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cshbv,hotfudgemonday,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:29:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, they'll let him start the season I would imagine, and then send him down depending on how he does with the men. It would be a shame to blow the first year of his ELC if he's not quite ready to play yet."

Obviously only 2 days in, though.   51 Boikov: I want to be friends with Boikov. Any time he scored a goal today, he let out a “woo!” and did a small celly. It’s very easy to tell that he loves the game and was having a blast today.  The smile didn’t leave his face the whole time, and he brought a really fun vibe to the morning session.  It helped that he’s a boss at skating as well.  His mohawk was great, his edge-work solid, and his quick turns were some of the best in the group.  He’s very comfortable with the puck, and he has an explosive first step.  All are wonderful things to see from a 6′-2″ defenseman.  If he can actually play defense, he could turn into a really solid prospect."

ColoradoAvalanche,3cla7i,lAJendary,4,Wed Jul 8 20:05:42 2015 UTC,I don't know nearly enough about our AHL guys/prospects but my top forward lines (I think) would be.. Agozzino - Hishon - Rendulic Greer -  Bleakley - Rantanen  Defense: Siemens - Bigras  Goaltending: Pickard Martin
ColoradoAvalanche,3cla7i,klondikethedestroyer,3,Wed Jul 8 20:11:05 2015 UTC,"Ok, made as good a depth chart as I could.  It has an entire extra forward line, and 2 extra defensive pairings.  I used minimal AHL-caliber players, attempted to make a depth chart using only guys who would actually be able to play NHL this year.  Looking at this, our team is pretty fookin deep.

ColoradoAvalanche,3cla7i,yobay,2,Wed Jul 8 22:19:25 2015 UTC,"one way contract for Winch, he will be starting on the 4th line in the middle without a doubt. Seems completely overlooked since his absence from the entire season last year"
ColoradoAvalanche,3ck2do,ALL_I_DO_IS_LURK1,9,Wed Jul 8 14:59:53 2015 UTC,"The reason it should be Beauchemin and Johnson is that we need a line pairing that can matchup with the toughest line.  Zadorov and Barrie aren't so bad defensively that they are going to be a liability, but Johnson and Beauchemin will definitely take the toughest minutes as opposed to having two lines that can be mostly responsible."
ColoradoAvalanche,3ck2do,Randywolf69,0,Wed Jul 8 15:26:06 2015 UTC,"Probably true and probably Sakic's thought process. However, you can only dictate match-ups at home."
ColoradoAvalanche,3ck2do,canucklehead272,3,Wed Jul 8 15:30:05 2015 UTC,"Match-ups are about a lot more than last change. Zone starts are equally, if not more important. Zadorov and Barrie would both benefit big time from getting more sheltered zone starts (like Barrie has for the bulk of his career). Johnson and Beauchemin are the guys who will take the tougher minutes in their own zone."
ColoradoAvalanche,3ck2do,canucklehead272,2,Wed Jul 8 18:30:09 2015 UTC,"I only meant who they were literally matched up against. I agree that zone-starts are hugely important for players like Barrie and Zadorov, but on the road they could get an offensive zone start and still be matched up against Toews-Kane, Getzlaf-Perry, etc... A lost face-off and quick breakout and then they are in danger of being exposed.   Basically, it's only specific situations like this that I am skeptical of a Zadorov - Barrie pairing, so I'm not sure it is worth it to alter it. But I was just throwing the idea out there."
ColoradoAvalanche,3ck2do,ZeArcadeAcadian,3,Wed Jul 8 18:44:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get the apprehension, but at the end of the day Zadorov-Barrie is one hundred times better than Guenin-Barrie so... The coaching staff both at home and on the road will do everything they can to get EJ-Beauchemin out against top opponents though, and there are plenty of ways to accomplish it even without last change"
ColoradoAvalanche,3ck2do,Shaneisonfire,2,Wed Jul 8 18:48:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I totally agree. The issue is having Johnson OUT of our top two or having Zadorov IN our top two."
ColoradoAvalanche,3ck2do,Subject2Change,2,Wed Jul 8 15:20:27 2015 UTC,"So we know how the top 4 is now shaped. What about the bottom pairing?  Stuart-Redmond, Stuart-Guenin, Holden-Redmond, Holden-Guenin,  It might be nice to have some competition for the bottom spots!"
ColoradoAvalanche,3ck2do,Shaneisonfire,3,Wed Jul 8 18:13:22 2015 UTC,"Stuart is going to make an EXCELLENT 5th D-Man, he was used as a pawn to eat up Top 2 minutes despite being a bit past his prime. The Avs knew a Vet wouldn't get down on himself or get in his own head, he was used in that spot til we were able to acquire the proper D we required in this offseason. Losing Briere's contract and not having to deal with ROR were huge factors for these offseason pickups.  It'll probably be Stuart-Guenin and Stuart-Redmond for most of the season. Stuart is going to mentor these kids and hopefully mold them into great stay at home d-men. Holden we might see play wing when needed, as he had some success in that spot last year when needed."
ColoradoAvalanche,3ck2do,canucklehead272,2,Wed Jul 8 18:57:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats a good point about Holden. I think he would actually be a decent 3rd, 4th liner with his ability to find the net. I remember last year Roy put him as a forward and he scored a goal. Barrie was also put as a forward for a short stint but that didn't work out as well haha. I agree with Stuart in a smaller role. Him and Redmond would be a nice pairing because Redmond has a little offensive side to him. Him and Guenin would be more of a shutdown line."
ColoradoAvalanche,3ck2do,iDeZire,2,Wed Jul 8 19:04:14 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt Stuart sits out, even though most fans probably want that to be the case. With that in mind I think the bottom pairing will be either be Stuart - Holden or Stuart - Redmond. I would really like to see Siemens contend for a sport this year though."
ColoradoAvalanche,3ck2do,iDeZire,2,Wed Jul 8 18:27:19 2015 UTC,"Beauchemin-Johnson  These guys take the tough minutes against top opponents, play 20+ minutes a night, AND they take the bulk of difficult faceoffs in their defensive zone.  Zadorov-Barrie  These guys play the next most minutes but get more sheltered minutes and better O-zone starts. That's something that Tyson Barrie as a totally offensive minded guy needs to be successful and something that Zadorov, as a super inexperienced NHL defenseman needs to continue adjusting to the speed of this league."
ColoradoAvalanche,3ck2do,vliegs,3,Wed Jul 8 18:32:33 2015 UTC,I think that's how it should be... Zads probably isn't ready to be stay at home stable enough to be paired with Barrie (who has his own defensive flaws)

ColoradoAvalanche,3cg9ce,ZeArcadeAcadian,16,Tue Jul 7 17:57:42 2015 UTC,"Also a new video coach:   In addition to Farrish, the Avalanche today also announced the hiring of Brett Heimlich as video coordinator. Heimlich, 29, spent the last eight seasons in a similar position with the San Jose Sharks.   So he has been an NHL video coach since he was 21? And also, the Sharks had a guy named Heimlich all these years but still choke...  Edit: more info on the video coach, he sounds like the real deal.  http://sharks.nhl.com/club/blogpost.htm?id=24282"
ColoradoAvalanche,3cg9ce,BananApocalypse,3,Tue Jul 7 18:27:05 2015 UTC,"Damn, I don't know about this Farrish guy, but Heimlich looks a great pickup for the front office for sure."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cg9ce,mtn_mojo,4,Tue Jul 7 21:17:58 2015 UTC,"Eh, is this good? We hired someone from the Maple Leafs and another from the Sharks?"
ColoradoAvalanche,3cg9ce,totosmaster,7,Tue Jul 7 18:00:10 2015 UTC,"I went over to the Leafs Sub and asked them about him. This was the first response: He was Carlyle's right hand man, so unless Randy only did amazingly stupid things with his left hand, Farrish is probably not going to help your team."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cg9ce,totosmaster,3,Tue Jul 7 18:19:14 2015 UTC,"Fun yet scary analogy. BUT, Roy's a good coach, so if he listened to Carlyle, maybe he'll just augment Roy's style (that's a hope)."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cg9ce,concussed_cowboy,6,Tue Jul 7 18:27:26 2015 UTC,Depends how you look at it. He was an assistant when the Ducks won the cup in 06. So he has a championship background in coaching you could say.  He also coached Beauch on that team as well

ColoradoAvalanche,3cg9ce,totosmaster,-1,Tue Jul 7 18:38:52 2015 UTC,"That win was nine years ago, though, and he's been with the Maple Leafs most recently.   After all of the good trades and draft picks we made, I'm now worried about our assistant coaching staff. Ugh. Can we ever get a break?"
ColoradoAvalanche,3cg9ce,concussed_cowboy,3,Tue Jul 7 18:31:03 2015 UTC,Ok? A cup is a cup and you can't deny that. Most players and coaches never win one.   He was with the Leafs for two years. If you're going to put the bulk of that blame on an Assistant coach you're naive. I'm not saying it's a great hire I'm just saying the Leafs were a shit storm the whole line down. One different Assistant coach was not going to change it.

Personnel weren't great, but they actually played even worse than their talent level.   This is not a good hire, and since Leafs fans on twitter are laughing at us, I again have to assume that we're going to be worse for it."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cg9ce,concussed_cowboy,6,Tue Jul 7 18:42:11 2015 UTC,That entire front office was a shit show. I'm not excited about it but I'm not concerned either.

They're the biggest fan base in the NHL, so obviously you can find examples of fans laughing at dumb things.

So not only Zadorov, but also MacKinnon, Everberg, and Siemens.  So that's cool.  BUT: if a player has a NMC or a NTC, they have to be protected.  So that means Landeskog, Iginla, Soderberg, Tanguay, and most importantly Stuart have to be protected.  Assuming the rules are the same, I would protect:  Forwards:   Landeskog Iginla Soderberg Tanguay Duchene Grigorenko Mitchell Comeau Hishon   Defense:   Stuart Johnson Barrie Beauchemin Elliott   Goalie:   Varlamov   McLeod, Bordeleau, Winchester, and Cliche are exposed up front.  Holden, Guenin, and Redmond are exposed at the back.  Berra in goal.  I would have protected Holden instead of Elliott, but his contract isn't great and that will scare off other teams."

ColoradoAvalanche,3cdi61,Nezirsc,8,Tue Jul 7 01:46:09 2015 UTC,"Born and raised in in STL, MO and I LOVE the state of CO (have a flag hanging in my room, flag bumper sticker on my car, etc). As much as I love the Colorado flag and all that it stands for...I LOVE the yeti foot as a patch more than the Colorado C. I think that is because we've always had the yeti foot (am I really getting to be the age where I don't like change?! ;) I think I would loved the Colorado C if we would have always had it. I don't HATE it, just love the yeti foot more. :)"
ColoradoAvalanche,3cdi61,AvsFanInSTL,4,Tue Jul 7 13:50:48 2015 UTC,"Bring back the foot!  I don't hate the new patch, but they fucking camoflauged it into the burgundy instead of making it stand out by alternating some of our other colors into it. And I still love the foot. BRING BACK THE FOOT."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cdi61,vliegs,3,Tue Jul 7 14:24:22 2015 UTC,I'm a big fan of the Rockies callback. Makes the new jerseys feel fresh even though it's a small change to add to the 20 year patch. You can order the away jersey with the new patch right now but not the home as far as I can tell. Plus we get a new stadium series jersey and probably a new third jersey. It's gonna be an expensive year.
ColoradoAvalanche,3cdi61,teddy_bearclaw,3,Tue Jul 7 02:22:58 2015 UTC,I really like the patch and cant wait for more merch to come out with the logo. I was just a little disappointed that they kept the apron strings on the jerseys. I had such high hopes for the new sweaters...
ColoradoAvalanche,3cdi61,Fitzwell,3,Tue Jul 7 04:49:40 2015 UTC,"Patch is awesome, still don't like the reebok style of the jersey. Needs more horizontal lines like a classic hockey jersey! :("

ColoradoAvalanche,3cdi61,godfadda006,4,Tue Jul 7 06:22:09 2015 UTC,"Well, when I first saw the new patch, my opinion was along the lines ""I really like the new patch, but not as much as the old one."" But seeing it on the jersey while someone is wearing it, as opposed to the jersey laying flat on a table, I honestly think I do like it better!"
ColoradoAvalanche,3cdi61,MileHighTech234,5,Tue Jul 7 02:40:35 2015 UTC,"As someone who is an Avs fan but has never lived in Colorado, I much preferred the Yeti."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cdi61,TheChad08,2,Tue Jul 7 10:41:03 2015 UTC,"I LOVE the patch. I am a Native Coloradoan, and I've always loved the state flag, so I was happy when they incorporated it. I would have been much happier if they would have had the foot on one shoulder and the flag on the other... or maybe put the foot above the name plate on the back.   I still hate the apron strings."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cdi61,bcos4life,2,Tue Jul 7 13:19:59 2015 UTC,"Here's my problem the new patch: It's burgundy thread on a burgundy sleeve.  It blends in and is going to be almost unnoticeable while players are skating, so it'll just look like a blue circle.  Personally, I think the Avs would have done much better with something like this."
ColoradoAvalanche,3cdi61,Sno_Wolf,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:37:49 2015 UTC,I really like the burgundy on burgundy. But it will probably look even better on the blue sleeves of the home jerseys.
ColoradoAvalanche,3cdi61,pilipinopapi,3,Tue Jul 7 19:16:03 2015 UTC,I just wish they made it stand out more. There's no distinct border so the colors of the patch and uniform blend. I'm sure they tried to use the oval background and it just didn't workout.   My prediction for the third uniform is that they will try for a Colorado flag uniform but it will end up looking like the Canadiens.
ColoradoAvalanche,3cdi61,compoundfracture,4,Tue Jul 7 04:22:19 2015 UTC,"From a graphic design standpoint you're correct. It's poorly designed given the saturation of maroon surrounding it.  People in general don't adapt well to change initially, and my current opinion is that I'm not a fan of the change and I don't know why they did it at all. That, and now my jerseys aren't current.

ColoradoAvalanche,3ccqnd,EduardoX,10,Mon Jul 6 22:07:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of Avs fans didn't like him for the wrong reasons. I don't think he was worth $7.5 a year, but I think he was one of the best players on our team the last several seasons."
ColoradoAvalanche,3ccqnd,starwarsnut107,7,Mon Jul 6 22:08:22 2015 UTC,"Problem is we couldn't keep them all Duchene, Landeskog, Mac, Barrie, EJ, Varly. So ya it sucks but I think long term he was the best to go, and we got a good return."
ColoradoAvalanche,3ccqnd,NOTArtaxiad,5,Tue Jul 7 00:17:36 2015 UTC,"This is what I hope most Avs fans will learn and understand in the coming years. We've got some people due some significant paydays very soon. If the Avalanche didn't have the personnel, and the future contracts they'll require, on the team, I think they'd happily give ROR what the Sabres just did.  I personally think he IS worth that much money, but we just couldn't swing it long term. All the other murmuring from fans is just sour grapes. I'm bummed he's gone, and wish him (eastern conference...) success."
ColoradoAvalanche,3ccqnd,canucklehead272,-4,Tue Jul 7 02:40:32 2015 UTC,This isn't true
ColoradoAvalanche,3ccqnd,slobbergob,5,Tue Jul 7 04:50:43 2015 UTC,"We couldn't keep him, all those listed, and continue to add to the defense/forward depth without expecting ELCs to come in and develop quickly.   It's possible it could be done, but it would be tight. This gives the Avs some breathing room, but at the expense of their best 2 way forward."
ColoradoAvalanche,3ccqnd,canucklehead272,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:41:35 2015 UTC,"I know. But this narrative Avs fans have manufactured about their impossible cap troubles is silly.

ColoradoAvalanche,3ccqnd,compoundfracture,3,Tue Jul 7 12:39:45 2015 UTC,"I agree that it wouldn't have been impossible, but to be fair those teams have a lot of clout to be able to pull deals like that off which is something the Avs currently lack"
ColoradoAvalanche,3ccqnd,tnick771,5,Tue Jul 7 13:19:21 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Losing him severely hurt the team. I can safely say nobody can really fill his void on our team.
ColoradoAvalanche,3ccqnd,Rudo3,10,Tue Jul 7 00:06:38 2015 UTC,it's a little late to be making a case for him eh?
ColoradoAvalanche,3ccqnd,Prestige0,3,Mon Jul 6 22:17:43 2015 UTC,"yeah exactly. great article showing off O'reilly but the timing is horrible for avs fans. We all (should) miss O'reilly and I hope he becomes the next Bergeron/Toews, but hopefully Zadz and Grigz pans out. I think they had pretty decent rel corsi % and we need D help."
ColoradoAvalanche,3ccqnd,Fitzwell,2,Tue Jul 7 04:00:00 2015 UTC,I cant wait to see Zadorov play. He crushes foos in the highlights I've seen of him.
ColoradoAvalanche,3ccqnd,hybridtheorist,3,Tue Jul 7 04:52:31 2015 UTC,"O'Reilly at 24 years old is probably worth about that much on both counts   I think that's probably fair. There's no way its going to look a ridiculous albatross contract in 4 years or so, especially if the cap continues to rise.   But the fact is, Colorado couldn't realistically have paid him that (and he might not have stayed even if we offered that) so we had to get what we could.  Buffalo have the cap space the next couple of years, so they can overpay, then get their money's worth at the end. We didn't have that option.   I think the team overall is probably going to end up slightly worse off for this trade, but our options weren't really ""keep ROR or take what buffalo are offering"", its ""take what buffalo are offering, or lose ROR next year for nothing."" We were right to trade him even if we end up worse off."
ColoradoAvalanche,3ccqnd,compoundfracture,3,Tue Jul 7 12:35:47 2015 UTC,"I loved having O'Reilly on the team. Realistically, his loss could drastically change the how the Avs play. Is he worth the money he got? Maybe. I'll even err on the side of 'probably.' I don't think it was in the best interests of the team to give him that because of his philosophy in contract negotiations, but more importantly: how he viewed his role on the team.  The thing about O'Reilly is that he was always getting paid extra on potential and not his performance the previous season. He wanted $5M because he had a decent season and refused to take the bridge contract because he was potentially worth $5M. Calgary stepped in and purposefully inflated his worth with the last year of that contract because they knew he'd be more likely sign the offer sheet that way, fucking the Avs if they matched. Luckily he continued to improve and was worth it, it could have been a disaster for him. Then came the salary arbitration with Sakic coming off a career year where he asked for more money than Duchene even though he had nowhere near the season Duchene had. Sakic had publicly talked about an internal cap where no one gets paid more than the best player (some people erroneous say it's that no one gets paid more than Duchene, but that's just because Duchene is currently the best asset on the team) and O'Reilly definitely wasn't the best player that year. The internal cap is meant to be incentive to get rewarded for play, not for potential (I don't know how this will play out with MacKinnon's contract, it will be interesting). Sakic's reasoning for this harks back to his career, citing that people getting overpaid can cause tension in the locker room. ROR blinked first in the lobby of the arb office and signed for $6M/yr avg, once again on potential. Now he's signed this contract with Buffalo with a $1.5M raise of guaranteed money, a raise that's based on the potential that he'll continue to improve. While that may be, the consensus is that right now it's an overpayment that will have consequences throughout the league not just in terms of money but that bonus structure. The only way that contract will be an albatross is if O'Reilly shits the bed. Even if he doesn't improve that contract will even out in a few years. But it's not the money, I think O'Reilly himself overvalued his play. Based on the comments after he left about the leadership thing and his desire to get his maximum $ amt every contract it's clear that O'Reilly wants to be ""the guy."" Everyone compares him to Toews/Bergeron/Kopitar but he's barely in the same category. He has that potential, but he hasn't elevated his game to that level yet.  I know this is getting ranty so I'll wrap this up: O'Reilly held out and the Avs filed arbitration because he felt he was worth more than what the Avs were offering. The original number he wanted happened to be more than Duchene who came off a point-per-game season and was undisputably a #1 center in the NHL. He caved at the last minute (literally) and got the same amount as Duchene. Going into the 2014-2015 he had the most to prove out of everyone else on the team. He wanted to get paid to be ""the guy,"" and Sakic gave him a 2 year bridge putting him in the category as the top paid player. With the departure of Stastny and Mac's inability to slot into center O'Reilly had to drop down to 2C and that was his chance. That was his opportunity to show Sakic ""I am the best player on this team and deserve to be paid as such."" The season started and the team stumbled out of the gate and O'Reilly stumbled with them. He wasn't ""the guy,"" he didn't elevate people around him, he didn't make a statement that he was the all-star on a slumping team. He was just as invisible as the rest of the team until Feb when he started putting up at a PPG pace. Interestingly enough this is the time when the rest of the team started playing consistently up and down the roster (even Stuart had some good games).  My sour grapes with ROR isn't his play. He was solid, and will probably develop into one of the most solid players in the league. My issue with ROR is that he was always putting the cart before the horse and that can create tension in a team setting, especially a young team. The unsubstantiated rumors coming out of the locker room about a rift between ROR and Duchene over the hold-out, or his gripes about being passed over for captaincy reflect this. While none of us knows for sure you have to stop and think there's probably a seed of truth in that for it to exist at all.  IMO that's what makes the legacy of ROR with the Avs so murky. He's an amazing player, the Avs were lucky to have him and get such a return for him, but I can't help but think there are some personality issues (look at that shit with his dad) that exacerbated the situation."
ColoradoAvalanche,3ccqnd,ZeArcadeAcadian,5,Tue Jul 7 15:02:59 2015 UTC,"I think O'Reilly may one day be in the vicinity of Bergeron skill. But the return we got for him is incredible. A top 4 dman (20 years old) in Zadorov, a current top 9 forward in Grigorenko (21 years old) with top 6 potential, a 2nd round drafted prospect, two 2nd round picks in consecutive years, and a 6th round pick."

Phenomenal shot blocker and solid in his own zone, but the same can be said for Jan Hejda.    I realize there's a lot of nostalgia with that team, but EJ's ahead of where Klemm ever was. The rest of the group is solid, though."
ColoradoAvalanche,3c9rml,asmodeanreborn,2,Tue Jul 7 05:29:01 2015 UTC,Yeah you're probably right about that
ColoradoAvalanche,3c9rml,canucklehead272,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:40:36 2015 UTC,"It's so hard to get over the nostalgia of those teams, but realistically I think EJ is just as good Uwe Krupp, though I will always remember that 96 run to the Stanley Cup. EJ's regular season numbers are just as good if not a little better than Krupp's after 96..."
ColoradoAvalanche,3c9rml,mtn_mojo,2,Tue Jul 7 15:05:13 2015 UTC,Yeah that's why I put them on a /. I think it's really close between the two. Krupp wasn't the two-way player that EJ is but he was one hell of a defenseman

ColoradoAvalanche,3c9rml,evildrpants,3,Mon Jul 6 13:09:13 2015 UTC,Varly as a backup and prime Tangs. I'm hoping in 2-5 years we will be able to add Mac to that list.
ColoradoAvalanche,3c9rml,Rudo3,2,Mon Jul 6 06:44:28 2015 UTC,"This isn't really a fair comparison unless you ask again in 5 to 10 years. 25-29 is generally considered prime age for hockey players. Duchene is only 24 and you already have him on the third line all time. Barrie is 23, Landeskog is only 22 and Mackinnon isn't even 20 yet. Hell Varly is only 27 and goalies tend to peak a bit later(though I don't think anyone will ever pass Roy). Most of our core has their best years ahead of them. Exciting times are coming."
ColoradoAvalanche,3c9rml,asmodeanreborn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:24:23 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Deadmarsh quickly became one of my favorite players 20 years ago, but honestly, I think Landeskog's probably ahead of him already. Kamensky was 29 when he finally hit his one and only full PPG+ season (he had 37 in 32 games with Nords too one year), yet I bet a lot of people would put him on the all time roster."
ColoradoAvalanche,3c9rml,blueliner30,2,Tue Jul 7 02:05:06 2015 UTC,"If we were building a full roster? Varly as backup and Duchene as a 3rd C(maybe) or solid 4th, oh and Tanguay on there as well"

ColoradoAvalanche,3c5uw6,godfadda006,11,Sun Jul 5 14:45:00 2015 UTC,"Here are just some things from the top of my head about our past and present players.  #19 Joe Sakic, Super Joe: The most respected and dedicated person in our organization.  Spent all 21 of his seasons with the Nordiques/Avalanche.  He was fast, had a deadly wrist shot, and brought in two cups and two olympic gold medals.  #21 Peter Forsberg, Peter the Great/Foppa:  In my opinion the best two way player of his time.  I have yet to see anyone as creative/skilled with the puck who could also flatten those who took their eyes off of him.  He lost half of his career to injuries and had 15+ surgeries trying to fix his foot before finally retiring with the Avs.  #52 Adam Foote, Footer: Stay at home defenseman with a temper only an Avs fan could love.  Not a guy you want to fight for pucks with in the corners, especially if you are a Red Wing.  He captained the team for a few years after returning from the CBJ.  He is now part of the organization and coaches our defensemen.  #33 Patrick Roy, Saint Patrick: Eccentric, cocky, and damn good at goalie.  Won 2 cups with Montreal, then 2 more with us before retiring at age 38.  Now our head coach.  Other retired players: Chris Drury (most of us are still mad about trading him), Milan Hejduk/The Duke (Captained the team after Foote then game the C to Landeskog), Rob Blake (Master of the hip check and deadly on the point), Stephane Yelle, Dan Hinote (pretty much the old McCleod), Kamensky, Ozolins.  Noteworthy Current Players:  #1 Semyon Varlamov: Our goalie who wears strange clothes and is all smiles after victories.  His English is always improving.  #2 Nick Holden: Don't let his baby face trick you, he is 28 and has two kids.  Got a lot of flak last season considering he is a bottom guy on a very weak defense.  #4 Tyson Barrie: Is quickly becoming a fan favorite with his offensive talents on defense.  #6 Erik Johnson, The Condor, EJ: Our #1 guy on D, he can hold his own and will throw some big hits if you try to beat him 1 on 1.  Suffered a knee injury towards the end of the season.  #9 Matt Duchene: Our #1 Center, we all love this guy.  He doesn't ask for much money, loves the organization, and will have you out of your seat at least once a game.  #12 Jarome Iginla, Iggy: He brings talent, class, and 90% of the Calgary fanbase.  Impossible to dislike this guy.  #20 Reto Berra: Our Backup goalie, who was very inconsistent last season.  He has very strong games and very weak games.  He may lose his spot to Calvin Pickard, who played lights out while Varlamov was hurt during the season.  #29 Nathan MacKinnon, Mack, Nate Dogg: Scary fast.  He had a disappointing sophomore season, but found his stride through the second half.  #40 Alex Tanguay, Tangs:  He started with the Avs and has now returned to finish with them.  He is the only player on the team that was there for the 2001 Stanley Cup season.  His patience is amazing and his shooting percent is ridiculous.  #45 Dennis Everberg: Our undrafted Swedish addition with a ton of potential.  #55 Cody McLeod: Our enforcer who can actually play hockey, not to be confused with Bordeleau who cannot.  He has more games played with the team than anyone else.  #92 Gabriel Landeskog, Mandeskog, Gabe the Babe, Landy:  The Captain.  He throws big hits and scores tough goals.  At only 22 years old, he will likely be here for a while.  I'm sure I left out several players who should be mentioned in here but that is some good information to start with.  You should also know we say GO ASS, Hail Satan, and have intermission Landeskogs in most/all of our GDT's.  Welcome to the group, Go ASS."

ColoradoAvalanche,3c5uw6,Buzanks,6,Sun Jul 5 20:12:24 2015 UTC,"We're on pretty good terms with the Bruins. My dad is a Bruins fan but adopted the Avs as his second team, because of the Bourque trade in 2000. The Bruins are my East team and never had any ill will against the Bruins. We were one of the cornerstones of the NHL from the mid 90's when the Nordiques moved to Denver to become the Avs, until the Lockout in 2004 when we had to get rid of our Core players due to the Salary Cap. We're starting to get back from the lean years that happened from 2005-2013 when Roy became Coach.   Going into this season, We do have the offensive powers in Duchene, MacKinnon , and Landeskog. McLeod, Mitchell are reliable, but McLeod may be a pest sometimes to other teams. Iginla is our veteran leader and he was welcomed into our team like he was with the Flames and Bruins. Our D consist of Johnson and Barrie, also we got Beauchemin and Zadorov in the last week via trade and FA. Our Goalie is Varlamov, and he's lights out and he's a fucking beast, especially against the Blackhawks. Berra is an alright Back up if you can get his confidence up like he did the last month of the season. You may get to see some Calvin Pickard this season, he was reliable when Varlamov was injured. Also you may recognize a player that is familiar with the Bruins, Sodenberg will be playing with us this season.   Our Main Rivals are the Red Wings and Wild. The Red Wings are from the first season we were in Denver and we fucking hate them. The Wild were another opponent up until our Playoffs meeting in 2014, when Cooke(that fucker that you may remember) fucking kneed Barrie and was out for the rest of the season, and the Wild ended our Playoff chances that year. Fuck the Red Wings, and Fuck the Wild are the only 2 phrases you need to say when we play them.   Welcome to the Avs Family and hope we can welcome you like we did with Bourque, Iginla, and hopefully Sodenberg too."
ColoradoAvalanche,3c5uw6,yettiornot_hereIcome,9,Sun Jul 5 03:40:30 2015 UTC,"I can now say ""Fuck Matt Cooke"" in three subs! This is the first off season I've followed in a real way, albeit following the Bruins, but I'm excited to follow both teams during the season. This was an awesome explanation and I appreciate it a LOT. I was a little scared to mention that I was a Bruins fan, since we aren't generally well received by most other teams. Your (can I say our yet?) ice girls are way more attractive than the B's, so you guys are making this REALLY easy for me. ;-P"
ColoradoAvalanche,3c5uw6,ColoradoHughes,6,Sun Jul 5 04:12:45 2015 UTC,"I think you can say ""fuck Matt Cooke"" in pretty much any sub except /r/WeLostTheNorthstars"

ColoradoAvalanche,3c5uw6,ColoradoHughes,5,Sun Jul 5 16:46:58 2015 UTC,"I think having Bourque on our 2001 Cup team solidified (at least for me) an Avs-Bruins connection that I'll always remember fondly.  Sakic giving the Cup to Bourque, instead of lifting it himself, will be a great memory I'll never forget.  It made me really happy for the Bourque/Bruins fans who had been waiting for his moment all those years, and super happy as an Avs fan to see such a classy move from our captain on the international stage like that."

ColoradoAvalanche,3c5uw6,Gen_Jack_Ripper,2,Sun Jul 5 04:20:07 2015 UTC,I'm trying to keep an open mind.
ColoradoAvalanche,3c5uw6,Steelcitty11,5,Sun Jul 5 16:46:39 2015 UTC,Cooke also made an attempt at elbowing mackinnons head during the playoffs as well.
ColoradoAvalanche,3c5uw6,androsphere,2,Sun Jul 5 07:11:11 2015 UTC,"And there's Tanguay too along with Iginla! Tanguay was drafted by the Avs way back when (late 90s), played for us until the 05-06 season, spent a few seasons elsewhere (mainly Calgary), and was traded back to the Avs a few years ago. He will forever be an Avalanche in my eyes even though he spent a few seasons on other teams. He's also still one of our top offensive producers, getting 55 points last season, behind only Iginla and Landy. He has some pretty stealthy moves to get around players and score goals you never thought possible. He even scored from behind the goal line against Calgary"

As much as I do like O'Reilly, and I wish something would have worked out, it was time. Hopefully Beauchemin can help mentor this young D on playing responsible defense. I mean he was averaging almost 23 minutes of ice time per game which would put him right behind Johnson."
ColoradoAvalanche,3c4woj,blueliner30,3,Sat Jul 4 22:24:57 2015 UTC,"I mean he was averaging almost 23 minutes of ice time per game which would put him right behind Johnson.     And averaging over 25 minutes in the playoffs... which was probably too much in the end, but he was playing awesome until the Chicago series."
ColoradoAvalanche,3c4woj,blueliner30,2,Sat Jul 4 22:26:44 2015 UTC,Yeah that's a tall order for anyone having to continuously go up against a damn near fresh Patrick Kane all the time
ColoradoAvalanche,3c4woj,rwh151,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:30:33 2015 UTC,I think they had a great offseason my only knock was getting Beauch at that contract. For the term we likely would have been better standing pat or waiting out and getting a guy like Cody Franson on the cheap.
ColoradoAvalanche,3c4woj,gynganinja,4,Sat Jul 4 21:42:14 2015 UTC,We don't need another RHD. Beauchemin is 2 years out of a 4th place Norris voting season. A stalwart veteran LHD who will be great at mentoring Zadorov and Barrie. Beauchemin and Johnson and Zadorov and Barrie are gonna make us a lot better this year. All in all I think we got a steal for Beauchemin. The RoR trade was solid. Glad he's gone. We're gonna be a bubble team again at least this year if we stay healthy and Rantanen and Grigs are ready. I wish the owners would just take the hit and buy out Stuart already though.
ColoradoAvalanche,3c4woj,canucklehead272,3,Sat Jul 4 22:07:27 2015 UTC,"I wish the owners would just take the hit and buy out Stuart already though.     Eh, we have the cap space for him right now and might as well play him over Guenin, at least. He was very solid on the PK (okay, that's about it) and would probably not be bad on the third pairing."
ColoradoAvalanche,3c4woj,canucklehead272,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:31:29 2015 UTC,The team cannot buy out Brad Stuart because he's in the first year of his contract. He's eligible for a buyout starting next summer.
ColoradoAvalanche,3c4woj,timbricker13,4,Sun Jul 5 01:20:06 2015 UTC,"But why would you want Cody Franson? Unlike Beauchemin, his defensive acumen isn't exactly renowned. There's a reason he didn't work out in Nashville. We do need to pawn off Stuart on somebody, though, so that when Beauchemin slows down more, we can move him down to the third without hurting from it."
ColoradoAvalanche,3c4woj,canucklehead272,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:50:14 2015 UTC,Cody Franson is an extremely talented two-way dman. He gets a bad rep because of overzealous Toronto media but his underlying numbers are awesome
ColoradoAvalanche,3c4woj,timbricker13,3,Sun Jul 5 01:19:23 2015 UTC,"He's talented offensively and can help a powerplay. He has a lot of flaws defensively, and that's not an opinion I've formed from Toronto media. I wanted to trade for him back when he was with Milwaukee because I was certain he was going to turn into a big and physical top pairing guy.    He is big. He is physical. He's not a top pairing guy... he often looks out of position in his own zone, which is why Nashville didn't give him much PK time at all. In other words, I was wrong about where I once thought he was headed.    Franson is not a two-way guy."
ColoradoAvalanche,3c4woj,slobbergob,0,Sun Jul 5 02:35:32 2015 UTC,"Another 2 way, offense first blue liner is NOT what we need"
ColoradoAvalanche,3c4woj,timbricker13,2,Sun Jul 5 18:31:28 2015 UTC,Two way and offense first are different things.
ColoradoAvalanche,3c4woj,slobbergob,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:38:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, typed 2 way then changed it to offense first and forgot to delete"
ColoradoAvalanche,3c4woj,rwh151,-1,Sun Jul 5 23:31:40 2015 UTC,"No, you're right. We should get a couple of stay at home guys like Guenin and Stuart. They've been really helpful.  Every competent defensemen in the NHL is at least some form of a 2 way guy. They may not be offensive, but they have to be able to move the puck."
