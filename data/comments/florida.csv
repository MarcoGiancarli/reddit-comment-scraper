A city that, like Florida may soon institute, has a decriminalized marijuana policy that only seems to be enforced on black communities. Let's pop back to Florida for a second, the stand your ground law, which TBO did an extensive research piece on each individual case shows CLEAR bias towards blacks.

I see what you're trying to get at and I'd really like to be on your side, but you're making the right points in the wrong places. You've called me racist like 5 times now because I'm not acknowledging it in a place where I don't think it exists. You're following one side of the statistical trend. You're pretending like there's a huge goverment racist agenda against blacks. Is it not much more likely that funds are allocated to specifically focus on high crime areas? What you SHOULD be looking at is the reason why those areas are populated by a large majority of blacks and that's where you'll find the racism. You mentioned that the judgements regarding the stand your ground law shows a clear bias against blacks. Is it also not likely that, considering a major part of these incidents happen in high crime areas populated by blacks, that populational proportion of arrests contributes to that? The issue as I see it is that they have absolutely been held back in the past, left to live in shitty areas that had been largely ignored by police, causing increased crime rates over time which is something that needs to change. Fortunately, a vast majority of the American population is smart enough to know that skin color doesn't mean anything, which is going to contribute in no small amount to needed reforms and continuing changes to address that problem. Before I moved to Florida, I grew up in downtown Cincinnati, and I can assure you that I got away with no more than any of my black friends. It's not like the police just let whitey go. Like I said before, you're trying to find racism in places where it's not as prevalent as the media makes it sound. You're following half of the data while ignoring the rest. You're contributing to racial tension by pretending to make a stand against it. Your goal doesn't even add up. Are you trying to get police to ignore petty crimes committed by someone because their skin is darker? Do you want more people to be arrested because they have light skin? Or do you think that more police should be in lower crime areas while we restrict the police presence in high crime areas? What you're talking about isn't equality."
florida,3e2kmg,employeesonly91,0,Wed Jul 22 01:54:31 2015 UTC,"Is it not much more likely that funds are allocated to specifically focus on high crime areas?   No, not at all. There are a number of reasons why police do what they do, some economical, some political and some social. Take the fact that in Tampa and St Pete we got this controversy over red light cameras and how the entire thing is a fucking racket to make big money for the local government and the company they've contracted with. Or that judge in Pennsylvania who had a fast track to put kids in private prisons.   Is it also not likely that, considering a major part of these incidents happen in high crime areas populated by blacks, that populational proportion of arrests contributes to that?   No. Please go look at the damned article. The trend is really fucking clear, dude.   Fortunately, a vast majority of the American population is smart enough to know that skin color doesn't mean anything,   Is that some of the same people who have swelled support for Trump after he called most Latino immigrants rapists? Or the ones who all went out to buy a Confederate flag to wave on their cars (and boy there sure are a ton now) in the shadow of a mass shooting at a church?  What I am talking IS equality. If the police are loose on white folk when it comes to petty crime, and we know this for a fact in plenty of examples I've already given, like NYC patdowns or how they enforce their marijuana law there as one example, then they should treat people of dark skin the same.  I've given you a couple of REAL factual examples. ignore them if you like, but like I said, it is obvious to me you are a racist and you don't even realize it and frankly I've given you enough time."

BROWN, jbrown@MiamiHerald.com  Kelly Bradley crouched in the corner of his cell, cowering under a blanket, as five officers clad in riot gear barreled inside and jumped on him, pinning him face-down.  As they cuffed Bradley’s wrists and ankles, one of the officers, William Hamilton Wilson, reached toward Bradley’s face and dug his index finger into the inmate’s eye — several times —until he ripped out Bradley’s right eyeball. It happened swiftly, almost as if it was routine.  Afterward, the extraction team at Charlotte Correctional Institution was summoned to the commander’s office. Capt. Scott Anderson, a 23-year veteran of the Florida Department of Corrections, asked the officers what happened.  No one saw anything. No one heard anything. No one could explain how Bradley’s eyeball ended up on his cheek, dangling by a thread.  Anderson later testified he didn’t think there was anything odd about it. He told the officers to write up only what they individually did, leaving out the injury, then ordered the cell cleaned up to make room for the next inmate. The officers’ gloves were discarded, and the gear was washed of blood.  The brutal encounter, focal point of a civil lawsuit settled by the DOC last month, was eerily similar to another cell extraction at Charlotte in 2014, except that it ended in the death of an inmate, Matthew Walker. Last week, a Charlotte County grand jury said there wasn’t enough evidence to bring criminal charges against the officers involved in Walker’s fatal beating, largely because the officers discarded the evidence and — as in the Bradley case — told their bosses that they had no idea how Walker’s larynx was crushed or how his head was bashed with such force that there were imprints in his skull.  Bradley’s case likely would have ended similarly — with no one knowing what happened and no one arrested — had it not been for one officer, John Pisciotta.  Pisciotta, then 34 and with 31/2 years on the job, was part of the extraction team that morning in May 2008 when Bradley, who suffered from schizophrenia, barricaded himself in by placing his mattress up against the door of his cell in Charlotte’s psych ward.  “This inmate was cowering under a blanket in the corner of his cell,” Pisciotta recalled in an interview this week. “He was an older man, very frail and mentally ill. He wasn’t trying to fight anybody. He was just scared. He was no threat to anyone.”  He saw everything that happened, and wrestled with what to do.  “I knew that it was morally wrong. They wanted us to prepare statements and not say anything. I told them I just couldn’t go along with it,” said Pisciotta, 41.  Pisciotta told the truth, and Wilson was arrested. After testifying against Wilson, Pisciotta was fired and lost almost everything: his home, his friends, his pension and his career.  “I knew once I did the right thing, and I stepped forward...my career would be over,” Pisciotta told a jury during Wilson’s 2009 federal criminal trial. “It’s something you don’t do. You don’t go against other officers. Because my life has been a living hell ever since.’’  Wilson, now 32, the only person criminally charged, was convicted of civil rights violations, served five years in federal prison and was released in December. Other than Pisciotta, no one came forward; no one else was disciplined. Six other officers were involved in the episode and four of them, including Anderson, were promoted. Two are still at Charlotte.  Bradley, 54, who was serving a six-year sentence for burglary and grand theft, was fitted with a prosthetic eye and released in 2009.  Pisciotta said after the trial Bradley’s mother called him to thank him.  “I just couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t tell the truth,” Pisciotta said.  Staff solidarity  “We Never Walk Alone” is an unofficial oath that Florida corrections officers have followed for decades, a mantra printed on signs in every state prison.  The words refer to the tight bond among corrections officers, men and women charged with keeping order among some of the most evil and lawless people in society.  To some, however those words are an unspoken code of loyalty that cloak more sinister — and sometimes criminal — acts. The average corrections officer lives every day with the absolute fear of speaking up, said Ron McAndrew, a former warden.  “There are a lot of good and decent people who work for the Department of Corrections. But there are also some people who intimidate them and prevent them from speaking the truth — even when a man’s life is at stake,” said McAndrew, who worked in the Florida prison system for 25 years.  McAndrew knows first-hand the consequences a whistleblower can face. In 1979, after McAndrew reported the beating of an inmate at Dade Correctional, his Doberman was poisoned. “It took six months for her to die,’’ recalled McAndrew, now a prison consultant.  Pisciotta’s $135,000 out-of-court settlement — and the full details of what happened to him — came to light this month, just days after a Charlotte County grand jury released a scathing report in connection with Walker’s death at Charlotte, located in Punta Gorda, north of Fort Myers.  Walker, who was serving a life sentence for burglary and robbery, died after his throat was crushed during a melee involving a team of at least five officers. Inmates told investigators that the officers beat Walker after he mouthed off and then slapped one of them — a female officer who had roused him out of his bunk after midnight, demanding he get up to put away a cup he had left out.  Pisciotta said he recognized some of the names of the officers involved in the Walker case. They were the “go-to guys” who commanders encouraged, promoted and rewarded for their loyalty and brutality.  “You are taught that you are God there, and the good ol’ boys, they are the ones they went to when they wanted things done because they kept their mouth shut, they all came up with the same stories, wrote the same reports and nobody knew anything. Nothing has changed,” Pisciotta said.  The Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which investigated Walker’s death, found that the officers’ versions of events changed over time, were riddled with “inconsistencies” and didn’t match the physical evidence. Still, there were no witnesses — other than inmates — willing to point the finger at the guards. FDLE said that amounted to a lack of evidence.  Nearly every officer involved in the incident remains employed by the department. Although nine were fired last year, all but one of them won their jobs back.  In April — one year after Walker’s death — prisons Secretary Julie Jones gave Charlotte Warden Tom Reid the “Secretary’s Leadership Award,” which recognizes a warden who “consistently exemplifies the department’s values.”  Department spokesman McKinley Lewis provided a list of the prison’s accomplishments under Reid, including extensive programs to help rehabilitate and reintegrate inmates back into society.  “It is only fair, when discussing an institution, to give credit to those who devote their time to go above and beyond to ensure the rehabilitation and betterment of our state’s inmates,” Lewis said.  Reid, who began his career at Charlotte, rose to the rank of major during his first 10 years with the agency. He was assistant warden of operations at Charlotte in May 2008, and was promoted six months later to warden at Martin Correctional Institution before taking the helm of Charlotte in 2012. On Friday, it was announced that Reid would take over as warden at Suwannee Correctional Institution, another Florida prison that has been under scrutiny for a series of suspicious beatings and deaths. The FBI is looking at several of the cases.  Jones, Lewis said, remains committed to overhauling the prison system. Since she was appointed secretary in January, she has initiated a number of reforms aimed at sending a message that retaliation will not be tolerated.  McAndrew, who has stayed in touch with many of his FDOC co-workers, said he is hearing good things about the changes.  “It’s not like they like her, but she has their respect and their attention,” he said.  Pisciotta’s attorney, Bill Amlong of Fort Lauderdale, said Jones may be making cosmetic changes, but until she shakes things up at the top, the abuse will continue.  “Generally, corporate culture does not start at the loading docks and seep up,” he said. “For this stuff to be going on, there must be a tolerance for it at the top that seeps down. I’m not exactly sure how you break that.”   (Continued below)"

florida,3dy2k5,Slave2isis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:52:09 2015 UTC,"Honor and pride  Pisciotta grew up in Long Island, N.Y., joined the U.S. Navy when he was 18, and served four years, two of them overseas. While in the Navy, he met and wed his wife, Nicole, to whom he has been married for 20 years. They have three children.  They lived in Connecticut and other places around the country before settling in Southwest Florida. He loved being a corrections officer.  “You get to help people every day. It was a sense of honor and pride, back then,” Pisciotta said.  In the moments before Bradley’s cell extraction, Pisciotta was so concerned about Wilson’s aggressive behavior that he asked his bosses not to let Wilson participate. Anderson told him Wilson would do fine.  “He was a big boy and he took care of what they wanted taken care of. He was part of the good ol’ boy crew that did things the way they wanted,” Pisciotta said of Wilson. “Unfortunately, I was part of the good ol’ boy crew that day.”  Pisciotta testified during Wilson’s trial that after breaching the cell, all the officers jumped on Bradley and had already subdued him, in handcuffs and leg restraints, when Wilson began “digging and digging” into Bradley’s eye.  Pisciotta said he shouted to Wilson to let him know that Bradley was restrained, but by then it was too late.  Horrified, but worried that the inmate would come to further harm if he told doctors and nurses what happened, Pisciotta whispered to Bradley to tell medical staff that he had gouged out his own eye. Later, at the hospital, and away from the guards, Bradley told the nurses what had actually happened.  After the incident, Pisciotta and the other officers gathered in a room at the prison to take off their bloody gloves and riot gear. Pisciotta said he was angry at Wilson for putting his fellow officers in jeopardy.  “I told him that I wasn’t going along with it,” Pisciotta said.  He said Wilson responded with a racial slur.  “C’mon, he’s just a f---ing n-----, whatta you care?” Wilson said, according to Pisciotta’s testimony.  “He thought it was funny,” Pisciotta said.  Anderson called all the officers into his office and instructed them not to mention the inmate’s injury in their reports, Pisciotta testified. Everyone — including Pisciotta — initially, did what they were told. Only one of the eight officers involved, a lieutenant who filled out his report in another room, noted Bradley’s injury. According to Pisciotta’s testimony, Anderson looked at Pisciotta, who was visibly upset, and said, “Are you OK? You’re making us all nervous here.”  On the same day that he gave a taped statement to an investigator with the DOC Inspector General’s Office, the harassment began, Pisciotta said.  It started with officers shunning him, then turned into threats and intimidation, according to his civil court complaint. A union representative warned him: “It’s going to be rough for you now.”  On June 6, 2008, Wilson was arrested on charges of aggravated battery. Wilson’s arrest affidavit — which described Pisciotta’s role as a witness — was sent to the email accounts of 19 different officers. Two weeks later, “Coward’’ was sprayed in black across the side of Pisciotta’s home. His car’s fender was damaged and its transmission wires were cut.  On April 1, 2009, Wilson was indicted, and his case was removed from the state attorney’s jurisdiction and reclassified by the FBI as a federal civil rights case. Wilson, who was fired after the arrest, contacted several of his fellow officers during the course of the federal probe, phone records show, but later denied in court that he tried in any way to influence their testimony.  The officers who testified said they couldn’t remember what the conversations were about. They also testified they didn’t see how Bradley lost his eye.  Thirteen days after the indictment, a corrections officer at Charlotte with whom Pisciotta had a brief affair called Reid, the assistant warden. The corrections officer, who had Reid’s cell phone number and knew him from when they worked together at another prison, left a frantic message for Reid to call her back.  Reid would later tell an investigator that the officer, Brandy Lindsay, told him a “rambling” and “emotional” story about how she had witnessed Pisciotta assaulting an inmate during a transport earlier that day. Pisciotta was placed on administrative leave.  Pisciotta complained to the Florida Commission on Human Relations, which investigates the complaints of whistleblowers who feel they were retaliated against. It found that the allegation against Pisciotta was false and that he was set up by his fellow officers.  Nonetheless, Pisciotta was fired by the department — hours after Wilson was sentenced, according to his lawyer.  Pisciotta and his wife sold everything they owned — their home and their vehicles — and cashed in his retirement. They moved to Vermont, where he accepted a job with the state prison system.  Still haunted by his experience in Florida, he recently resigned to go into farming.  None of the other officers involved in the extraction, either as active participants or supervisors, were disciplined, except for Wilson. Anderson, the captain, was promoted to colonel and is now at Okeechobee Correctional Institution.  Lt. James Nordstrom resigned Nov. 8, 2008; Lt. Michael Riley was promoted to captain before resigning in 2013. He remains as one of the leaders of Teamsters 2011, the union representing the department’s corrections officers.  Officer Ernest Hoopes resigned in November 2008. Officer Stephen Lekawa was promoted to sergeant and remains at Charlotte. Officer Jeffery Koslowski was promoted to sergeant, then lieutenant. He’s now a captain at Charlotte."

florida,3duk3g,acusticthoughts,12,Sun Jul 19 16:51:45 2015 UTC,"Careful, when they change to that orangish color sometimes it's because of mating season... they can get VERY aggressive during this period.  Igs do bite, and do have teeth! Their teeth are sorta like the serrations on a plastic disposable knife. They are for tearing/sawing though raw plant matter (their primary diet) and will leave you with a nasty bite. I cringed when I saw your bare foot so close to his snout.   I had a large male Ig for a pet for a long time. During breeding season he was an asshole, and bit me once when I was trying to feed him.  Many people also warn that Igs (like other reptiles) can carry salmonella. (Wash the fuck outta the bowl...)  All in all I find them very intelligent for reptiles. You can even house break them. He may now associate you with food, and you may now have a new ""friend"". :)  Edit : This is similar to the bite I received."
florida,3duk3g,Cronus6,5,Sun Jul 19 20:52:09 2015 UTC,"A housemate and I adopted a mutual friend's iguana when he could no longer care for him.  He was huge, nearly six feet long nose to tail.  We were rehabbing the place and didn't care about the carpets so we basically gave him free roam of the house, though he generally stayed in front of a sunny window we augmented with a heat lamp most of the time. Much to our amazement, and with no training from either us or the prior owner, he did his ""business"" in the bathtub!  In the two years we had him he only went outside the tub once, and that may have been because someone left the door closed."
florida,3duk3g,FullFrontalNoodly,6,Sun Jul 19 21:17:29 2015 UTC,"he did his ""business"" in the bathtub!   YES!  The easiest way to housebreak them is to put about 2 inches of water in the tub and put them in it. Do this everyday around the same time. I started mine when  he was just a baby, he took to it right away, and would ""hold it"" in his cage.  What I later learned is that 1)Igs like to swim and are really fast at it. and 2) in the wild they like to jump in the river/stream and shit! (A herpetologist at the zoo told me this tid-bit).  Mine got to be about 6 foot too. And he was given the guest room as his ""cage"". I put plate shelves about 12- 18 inches from the ceiling since they are mostly arboreal and need to climb/be high up to be happy/healthy. Add to this cargo nets made of hemp rope or sisal, big old pieces of driftwood (sterilized) and such. Lots of UV lamps and heat lamps too. (UV is often neglected, they need to to metabolize calcium.)  Anyway, when he would hear water running in the bathtub down the hall he would scratch at ""his"" door like a dog! Open the door he'd truck on down to the bathroom and hop in the tub on his own.  I'd always spray it down with a diluted bleach and water mixture when he was done.  He was super-chill and over all the years I had him (he lived to be about 15-20) he only ever bit me that one time."
florida,3duk3g,Cronus6,8,Sun Jul 19 21:37:31 2015 UTC,Where in FL are you? Be careful those things can be mean little bastardized. They have incredibly short teeth and can cause a lot of damage with their tails too.

florida,3dqpck,realjd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:46:06 2015 UTC,"First, I hope you have an amazing time. Florida has a lot to offer folks who veer off the beaten path. I like the outdoors and history (definitely hit St. Augustine, as someone suggested) so I'll offer just a few of the spots I like. Hope they sound interesting.   -Springs are all great places to stop in. One of my favorites is Wekiwa Springs State Park. Beautiful spring and great swimming. Right next to it you can also rent canoes, kayaks, or paddle boards at a pretty reasonable cost for a trip down one of the two Wild and Scenic designated rivers in Florida. It's a pretty easy trip, so even if you have never really paddled before you should have a pretty good time.  -Two other great spots to get out and hike/swim/paddle are Hontoon Island and Blue Springs. If you take the hiking path out through Hontoon you'll end up on one of the last remaining, and biggest, Native American mounds in Florida. In fact, most of that park is comprised of archaeological sites. Blue Springs is another great spot nearby (the Thursby House there is on another large mound) and if you're SCUBA certified you can dive down the spring boil, but you'll need your own equipment.  -If you're coming into the state on the east coast, stop in north of Jacksonville to the Kingsley Plantation. It preserves and interprets not only an important time period in the state's history, but the amazing archaeological work that has been occurring there over the last several years. Plus, beautiful spot. If you like seafood, just find some rundown looking joint and go to town, it's all good stuff up there.  -Further down the east coast you can visit the Kennedy Space Center. A little pricey, but something you'll always remember, especially if you're into the history of space travel. For me, I can never shake how amazing it is that on Cape Canaveral we had some of the first interactions between humans from the Old and New World and from that spot centuries later we traveled to truly New Worlds.  -If KSC is too pricey, still consider hitting the Canaveral National Seashore. Beautiful spot, also a place you can rent canoes. Don't miss Turtle Mound while you're there; it's another gigantic Native American mound.  -Further down the coast in Stuart you can stop in to one of the last remaining Houses of Refuge. These used to be up and down the coast in Florida to aid shipwreck survivors. There's even a shipwreck just off the beach there that on a good day you can see from the dune. If you're a good swimmer and the water was calm enough you can even snorkel on out.  -For food, you'll find good stuff all over. Orlando is booming right now with great restaurants all over the place. I'll just mention one unique, fun spot. Hollerbach's Willow Tree Cafe in Sanford is a great time. Sanford is a nice, historic city with a few museums and walkable downtown. Not big, though. Hollerbach's is one of the best German restaurants in the country (they've got the titles to prove it!). Be sure to go on a night when the entertainers will be there and you'll feel like you're in big beer hall. It's a fun time with amazing food. It's a whole evening though, so go prepared to hang awhile. And definitely make reservations if you're going.  There's a million things I could probably mention, but don't want to drown you in suggestions. Hope you and your gf have a great time!

Once we give up the quaint notion that government services should be available to any, ahem, citizen, we can actually get things nicer for the people that matter: the ones who can pay.  I propose a special lane for $80k+ electric cars, with roadway inductive charging, and no speed limit. We can collect some nominal fee at time of tag registration.   Think of the savings in time, for rich people like me! It will keep the rabble out of my way, which, while I think it's the proper goal of government, might offend some Democrats or democrats. So, I propose we also add a layer of abstraction with some Authority, so this preferential treatment in my favor gains an air of deniability.  Paying for a $80k electric car is voluntary, so it's not even unfair, when you get down to it. Those who bought one deserve to be able to use it without having to be impeded by Those People.  The great thing is that by stratifying usage, we electric car users lose sight of the problems faced by those schlubs in their stinky gasoline-burners.

florida,3dmlj6,chadmill3r,2,Sat Jul 18 09:43:49 2015 UTC,"At least, we should require tolls pay for construction only, and when the road is paid for, the road must be gifted to the state and all tolls removed.

florida,3dmlj6,chadmill3r,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:50:25 2015 UTC,"This was one of the more reasonable comments. Yes you would think that once the tolls actually collected the dollar amount of the original construction, that they should be removed. Perfectly reasonable proposal. But it doesn't work that way.  The problem with tolls is the same problem that they have with parking meters (which should never have been invented, imo). The state issues bonds to pay for construction of, for instance, in the one example, a parking garage, and in the other example a road. Part of the legal agreement backing up the bonds is that there will be meters to provide revenue in first example, and tolls in the other example. When the bonds are all paid off, they sure do not rip out the parking meters, nor the tolls.  My view is that we should be discouraging the construction of parking garages, and that parking meters do not add anything of value once the bond for the parking garage bond is paid.   In the case of roads, there is really no avoiding the need for them, which really just bolsters the case that a road is such an essential item, that you can't make it a user fee public good.  Just collect the damn taxes, and pay for the damn construction like they do everywhere else."

florida,3dmlj6,Lyxh,0,Fri Jul 17 23:39:09 2015 UTC,"The infrastructure needed to collect the toll is an expense that would otherwise not be needed. It creates an additional road hazard. A road toll puts a burden on particular groups of people, even though everyone gains a benefit from the existence of the road. It taxes rich and poor at the same rate, which is regressive. Even if we accept this, the revenue could equally be collected in the form of a gasoline tax (which would have the additional benefit of incentivizing efficiency).   But the reason I find it immature, is that I find conservatives in general to be immature. The idea of a toll road is a conservative idea that is based on the fact that they hate it when people get together and put their collective power to work to the benefit of the whole society. They always try to find a way to make things that breaks up collective action, and the result always works for rich people, but doesn't work for poor people. A poor person is more likely to be in the difficult position of trying to scrounge for the toll. Whereas, it's something that a rich person never has a problem with."

Express Lanes clear up the roads. The more people that use the ExLanes the less people there are on the normal lanes.  Clearing and maintaining these tolls creates jobs. To disclose my parents even run a small business, that employes ten people, where they install the equipment to read EPasses   An unfortunate truth is, the more expensive we make it for people to drive the more pressure there is placed on the State to develop more effective (/cheap) methods of transportation.  The infrastructure needed to collect tolls is only getting cheaper and is easily re-cooped by the tolls.  With ExLanes implementing congestion pricing is then possible. If the road is packed then raise the price of the ExLane and those that can afford it can deal with slightly less traffic and those that can't benefit from there being less cars in the normal lanes because of the ExLane.  Assuming that only conservatives are pro- tolls is simply incorrect. Placing tolls on roads is also a way to deal with environmental issues. Rase the cost so the demand lower so there's less emissions. I'm as liberal as you can get (a gay, uni grad, environmentalist) and I think tolls are a god idea."

It is not the intent of gas taxes to influence use of alternate fueled vehicles nor should it be. Road users should be taxed to pay for the road usage regardless of how their vehicles are powered. Taxes should be levied only to compensate for the use, not to control behavior.  If you don't like toll roads, then don't use them."

In the case of energy use, the consequences for the whole society, and the Earth are so serious that we can't really let the brainless conservatives hold the rest of us hostage because they have Stockholm Syndrome for a small group of rich people.   If you don't like toll roads, then don't use them.   As a taxpayer, and citizen of the state, those roads are already public property (i.e. my property, yours and mine). In fact, they had to make an exception in the law for them, because they are otherwise a public right-of-way.  So the creation of a toll is literally taking rights away from some people.

No relief was given by the carpetbag and scalawag government or by the Union troops. The result was the emergence of secret societies claiming to bring law and order to the county. One of these groups was the Ku Klux Klan, an organization that sometimes took vigilante justice to extremes but was sometimes the only control the county knew over those outside the law. The Klan faded from view at the end of Reconstruction. It had minor come-backs in the 1920’s and mid 1950’s. Since then it has become the subject of legend rather than a cause of fear.   If he thinks that the clan was there to deal with lawless ex-slaves then he not only meant to glorify the Klan but also to promote a revisionist view of history. Given that the artist can't even acknowledge that the KKK was a mistake what mistakes is it helping prevent?  My opinion is that it labels Baker as a haven for Klan sympathizers and it only serves to support my standing rule on not stopping anywhere on I-10 except for Pensacola, Tallahassee, and Jacksonville."

Further, if you know anything about this story, and I suspect you only know what you read or hear in the Florida political media, then you know that your governor was CEO of Columbia Health Care, which later merged with HCA in Nashville. And that when the shit hit the fan, as you say, the Feds determined that most of the ""fraud"" that Politifact likes so much to lay at your governor's feet actually occurred specifically at HCA 10 years BEFORE they were bought by Columbia.  Also, other respectable institutions, such as Johns Hopkins and Mayo Clinic, were also hit with so-called ""fraud"" fines. It was a simple fact of life in the 1980's and 1990's that the federal government's medicare oversight sucked.  That's why Clinton finally just decided to crack down on it.

It's far simpler than STV and it has the opportunity to cause it's own iterative affect that can reverse the way FPTP has trained voters.  STV still seems to support two parties as split votes can mean candidates get eliminated, even if they they were a good second or third pick.  Preferential voting won't have much effect on the first election, but when they see 3rd parties with 30% votes, they might be more willing to untick one of the two parties next time, at which point we might have a 3rd party candidate with 45% and Republicans democrats with only 40% each."

And it'd be hard to just jump straight in from FPTP.  Is preferential the one that's simply ""mark one or more candidates"" and the votes are equal? I think that's easy, and a logical step when you consider that third parties aren't winning anytime soon. I just wouldn't want to see it in place permanently, it would be important to me to indicate that my vote is for a third party, but my backup vote is for a major party. I think the system would unfairly favor centrist candidates and the two major parties (which I view as being relatively centrist as well).

florida,3diknj,Lilusa,8,Mon Jul 20 14:19:13 2015 UTC,I submit it is because the capital needs to be moved to Orlando or Tampa and out of the backwater of Tallahassee. See this 2013 study: http://www.citylab.com/politics/2013/05/how-geography-influences-political-corruption/5642/

florida,3dl9c0,plabadajan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:47:36 2015 UTC,"Ah, this is a result of the mod team going through the moderation queue and trying to clean it up. Some stuff is getting removed and old things that inexplicably got caught up in the filter are getting approved. I didn't realize they'd show up in new, I think I'll make sure to remove all instead of approving. Sorry about that!"
florida,3djugh,razzertto,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:17:21 2015 UTC,"It's fine to be opposed to this, but this headline is absurd. The water won't be drawn from the spring. The property is 12 miles to the north."
florida,3djugh,Manateekid,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:01:40 2015 UTC,"But the water is drawn from the aquifer that feeds the spring. The concern is that this will further reduce the flow of the spring which is already down significantly from a decade ago.   But yes, the headline (and the actual story) don't mention this. They make it sound like the cattle ranch is going to run a big pipe to the mouth of the spring and pump up the water."
florida,3djugh,realjd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:13:53 2015 UTC,"And, that's not correct. The Judge's 100+ page order found otherwise."
florida,3djugh,Manateekid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:58:24 2015 UTC,What part isn't correct? Are the ranchers not pumping from the aquifer? Are people not concerned about the spring flow decreasing further?
florida,3djugh,realjd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:14:50 2015 UTC,The judge found the science established there would be no reduction in flow at Silver Springs. Zero.
