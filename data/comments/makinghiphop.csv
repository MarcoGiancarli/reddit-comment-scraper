makinghiphop,3e5q4e,boldden,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:04:15 2015 UTC,Exactly who I was thinking should be on it haha thanks man

makinghiphop,3e5q4e,tgoldenbeets,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:19:01 2015 UTC,"I really like this beat, maybe unquantize/swing the drums at parts, the patterns, especially the hi hats got a little predictable"

makinghiphop,3e5q4e,ANewFam,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:17:16 2015 UTC,this sample sounds so damn familiar... hmmm... i think the drum break sounds too harsh for it tbh. do you have some sort of phaser on it too? or chorus or something? i hear the snare/cymbal/hat sounding like its being panned back n forth very very quickly and it gives it a weird distortion. i dont like that actually. other than that i can't really offer much help.. good cover art too
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,leeeeland,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:27:07 2015 UTC,https://soundcloud.com/kalm1/like-im-depressed-or-some-shit/s-lGcqz   Kinda like a Blockhead beat. I dig the sample. A delay/verbs on the harsh crash/open hat would be nice.

makinghiphop,3e5q4e,al_hza,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:29:06 2015 UTC,"I really don't dig the percussive sound on the synth/organ, otherwise, this goes pretty hard. Some more verb on the drums would make it sound a bit more contemporary. Dope shit."

makinghiphop,3e5q4e,ProSwervez,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:01:39 2015 UTC,This is smooth. Everything in the right place sonically. Its a good track. The trappings not really my style but it still works well with the instrumental.
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,MrHardR,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:07:05 2015 UTC,I feel I could take your vocals on the verses and move them up half a bar and they would hit nicer.

makinghiphop,3e5q4e,yourcoolmailman,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:08:00 2015 UTC,"not bad, a lil off key at some parts but i think that's how it's supposed to sound. it definitely has it's own feel to it."
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,boldden,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:11:22 2015 UTC,"I thought the snare could've definitely cut through more with a little more low end to it. Kick kinda sounded filtered, that could've hit harder too. 808's were cool but if you added a little distortion they could've stood out more. The rapping was pretty tight, I liked the melodic flow of the first guy and the second guy had a nice delivery. Could use a little more energy and charisma though"
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,DonatoMedia,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:13:22 2015 UTC,"Damn, this is super smooth. The chorus is ðŸ”¥! I like the synth during that part a lot."

makinghiphop,3e5q4e,renninninefive,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:01:57 2015 UTC,you need to compress the vocal more. it sounds a little wavy  nice work though!
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,blackkyle__,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:41:07 2015 UTC,https://soundcloud.com/irapsometimes1/unfinished-weird-untitled-demo   that lead synth seems a little high in the mix? nice triplets on the hats. Strange that those nice electric keys are present in the intro and never shine back through in the instro.
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,tgoldenbeets,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:26:36 2015 UTC,Here's something I made today. Hoping to improve it somehow  https://soundcloud.com/letsruntrack/betrayall
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,leeeeland,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:02:07 2015 UTC,i'd take out the deep synths or keys in the back and add something else to distinguish it from other trap beats.
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,boldden,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:13:31 2015 UTC,I think the only thing that needs to be tweaked is the bass/kicks. Could definitely use an 808 low passed or something underneath to give it that extra rumble and tie the entire drum pattern together.
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,InsetSync,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:38:09 2015 UTC,"I think that really high end distorted synth at the beginning and throughout could have a little more reverb.  When the snare does the triplet fading echo thing the rhythm feels off, or maybe it echoes once too many times, something just feels out of place with it.  That airy snare thing that pans right to left at :55 is dope as hell, really like that, probably my favorite piece of the beat.  I think you should use that a couple more times throughout the song.  At around the 2:23 mark the vocal sample 'ah' seems just a little off beat, maybe trim the beginning/move it over a little.  Overall I like he atmosphere for sure.  I like that you take it easy on the bass, but a think a few stronger held bass notes could make an impact if implemented well."
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,StartlingRT,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:07:07 2015 UTC,https://soundcloud.com/letsruntrack/betrayall   I like those 5ths on the synths. I don't think the way you used those vocal chops was flattering. The mood is kinda haunting and the stabs seem too dry to fit the mood. Maybe verb em out hella and maybe pitch them down?

I feel like creative effects on your vocals would be a good look. Overdrive/distortion/creative eq'ing would be dope. Aggro filters for a fairly aggro delivery?

makinghiphop,3e5q4e,yourcoolmailman,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:02:20 2015 UTC,"Dope beat man. Honestly I can picture some European or Asian (maybe Indian?) female vocal sample wavering throughout the instrumental, not loud enough to distract from the main melody but enough to give a daunting vibe, you know?"
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,ttubholejones,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:28:04 2015 UTC,"The high end is really simple, hi hat isn't doing much and that synth is a little weak at the beginning.  The way it pitches and wavers up is pretty dope though, transitions into the new synth pattern nicely.  I liked the strong crash cymbal when it came in.  The panning marimba thing is nice.  Enjoyed the There Will Be Blood sample.  You could probably layer another pair of toms with what you have to make a more distinct sound."
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,StartlingRT,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:13:03 2015 UTC,https://m.soundcloud.com/general-american-records/drainage   I think it's missing a melody?
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,tgoldenbeets,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:31:57 2015 UTC,I guess I hear it now in the little bloopy piano. Something to expand upon and layer?
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,tgoldenbeets,2,Wed Jul 22 05:32:40 2015 UTC,Donâ€™t know if it works or not.  Took a bunch of samples from different genres and tried mashing them together. Thoughts?  https://soundcloud.com/reble-t/show-stopper/s-Zzjg1
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,StartlingRT,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:02:25 2015 UTC,think it would be interesting if some one tried to get on this but as just a instrumental this sounds real live man
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,ANewFam,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:12:01 2015 UTC,Really well done. I felt like the samples progressed into each other and had a tone that complimented the other.

makinghiphop,3e5q4e,ANewFam,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:07:49 2015 UTC,first verse is just too slow and the lines you enunciate to be like clever aren't good enough to get any reaction. Second half is a lot better though!

makinghiphop,3e5q4e,ANewFam,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:22:06 2015 UTC,I think you are trying to cram what you're trying to say into too little of a timeframe. The lyrics aren't bad but it's gotta kinda ride the beat more like around 0:23 and after a bit it kinda gets jammed and it detracts from the overall rhythm of the song.
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,agentpaco,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:26:57 2015 UTC,Really enjoying the beat but your voice is too quiet and blended in comparison to it. Other than that it's really well put together.

makinghiphop,3e5q4e,mister-nebula,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:03:14 2015 UTC,I'm liking all the arrangements and in the second part around 1:00 they fit together really well but the drums need a bit more volume and snap to them. The horn is a bit too loud and too synthetic sounding for the rest of the sounds. A bit of EQ and tweaking with the snares/kicks and it'll really shine.
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,InsetSync,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:32:05 2015 UTC,"that pitched ""yea!' sample is VERY distracting. i actually thought it was my neighbors little shit dog yapping. synths sound very monophonic and like cheesy vsts, but the notes, melody and progression sound good."

makinghiphop,3e5q4e,MrHardR,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:05:38 2015 UTC,"pretty much hate everything about the piano/glock chords. the progression, the timbre, the timing, the lack of motion/variety. i know you took them out and brought them back, but i needed a serious breather. automate something if you must keep those chord voicings so it's not so repeptive. would also like to see more funky drumming to give it some swing. very stiff right now. look in to ""humanizing"" arrangments and drumming for starters"
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,leeeeland,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:32:01 2015 UTC,then mission accomplished. you totally laid down a crazy ass vibe on this one. im loving it. i guess the drums could be a little looser tho

Try to stick to a consistent rhythm for the whole song, this is a defining aspect of hip hop. If you are going to mix samples and synths (which is hard) you have to be very selective because they often don't blend well. Right now you're better off making either sample-based or synth based hip hop, but not trying to blend them."

makinghiphop,3e5q4e,blackkyle__,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:58:35 2015 UTC,The hats are definitely overpowering the snares and kicks. The snares could be louder the second bass hit with less velocity could be as well. There's a lot of higher frequencies that could be brought down and it would round out the beat a bit more.

makinghiphop,3e5q4e,dfcade,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:08:32 2015 UTC,Hello Squad. I have only been at this beatmaking thing for a couple of weeks and so I am sure there is countless tips for improvement you more experienced members could impart upon me. Feel free to criticize the shit out of this. It is my second beat I've finished.  https://soundcloud.com/mario-hoyos-1/on-poverty
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,sunshinechs,2,Wed Jul 22 05:09:24 2015 UTC,Ok That's pretty crazy for your second beat. The hook doesn't flow right its kinda abrupt. Other than that nice beat you could add more sounds and mix it up a bit not much going on but nice.
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,therhajon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:34:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. I totally agree that it the transition into the hook is pretty wack, couldn't figure out a great way to do it. I appreciate the feedback though!"
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,sunshinechs,2,Wed Jul 22 05:43:09 2015 UTC,"I can feel where you were going with this.  I like the head nod beat, but I think some of the timings could be tightened up a bit.  Real sparse, minimal slow things have to infinitely more precise than faster messier things.  You also never had more than one snare (ie youd boom BAP boom boom **).  That second bap really woulda added a bit of continuity.    Kick drum and bass dont punch through as much as they could, but I still wrestle with that ALL THE TIME.  The rainstick/mandolin/sitar noise is dope, but I'm a sucker for that kind of thing.  Chord stab was unexpected, but only because I think maybe it could be used a bit more.    Bassline a bit mechanical.  Having the harpsichord plunk along with the bass part adds emphasis on the changes; you might consider playing with that 'expectation', listener is used to the two parts hitting in unison so messing with the rhythm on one compared to the other can give people the little knowing producer grins.  Part starting at 1:08 was a breath of fresh air, but that could be cos the mandolin bit featured more, and like I said, sucker for it.  Not trying to be a hater at all.  Dope for a second beat.  Much love."
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,dfcade,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:35:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're being a hater at all! I truly appreciate the feedback. I can definitely see what you are getting at with all of that. I was trying to figure out how to get more punch with some compression, but being that I still don't know what the hell I'm doing it was somewhat of a guessing game lol. I will try adding that second snare and see how I like the sound! Thank you so much!"

makinghiphop,3e5q4e,Puntang_Crusher,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:11:39 2015 UTC,"Could use a more staccato kick layered to give the low end some definition, and maybe some high end percussion peppered in there.  And add a snare even if it's subtle.  I'd pick a few of your favorite portions and try to find your favorite loops instead of changing to something completely new.  In some spots it just sounds like you're playing the sample for a long time.  There's some cool ideas in here for sure, you just needs some pop to make it bang more.  Drums/Percussion could probably do this."
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,StartlingRT,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:27:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed with this.  While I am personally a sucker for the classic boom bap sound, I also happen to think that if you were to put a deep NY drum style on it it'd be banging.    Mm big fan of the chopped up style though, and of course you could throw an Amen on there.  Sampled from a variety of things, only one or two tunes??"

makinghiphop,3e5q4e,ktizzel,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:16:24 2015 UTC,"Define 'trying to find'.  You fit naturally with the rest of it while you're singing, I might say you sound a bit hesitant sometimes, especially the spoken 'all this fake shit is eating my soul' and your fadeout solo vocals.  Love the production, tho.  You went from a sort of touched up electronic singing FX to a more natural sound later on?  What kind of effects did you have on there?    Also related, the first 3/4 of the song have a constant electronic presence (ie, theres always some sort of synth or other kind of sound) but then during the fadeout it goes to all natural sounding instruments, which is maybe isolating the fadeout vox.    Do like the conversational overlays."

makinghiphop,3e5q4e,EccentricEnterprise,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:25:35 2015 UTC,"I think the snare could use some more high end, it sounds a little flat right now.  I like the echoing synth.  I didn't like the like cymbal on the upbeat at :53 during the transition.  I think you should make that fall on a down beat.  I think if you automated some of the synths' EQs that could add another dimension to make it change up a little more."
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,StartlingRT,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:31:18 2015 UTC,"The drums don't feel very fleshed out. It feels more synth than it does boom bap -- which isn't a bad thing at all, but that's just what I noticed.  Is there something specific you'd like feedback on?"
makinghiphop,3e5q4e,blackkyle__,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:49:12 2015 UTC,"Mm, that transition at 1:16.  Might drop some drums out a little earlier, like 1:10, make the incoming beat and bass hit have that much more oomph.  Also like the echoing synth, bass adds nice low end but doesnt intrude on the echo.    Consider dropping a snare every now and then on the breakdowns at :58 and 2:00.  Love the heavy chilled feel."

makinghiphop,3e5q4e,dukiejbv,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:25:53 2015 UTC,"can immediately tell that I don't like the drum pattern. kick is too loud in the low end, the snare is  a bit lifeless in the high end. recording quality is decent, flow isn't really there, too choppy for my tastes. it definitely had some parts that could work (~katy perry line), but the beat is doing absolutely nothing for me. the bass synth is super hollow and a bit stock. i do like the keys that come in. where are the hats? there is a pitched down hat sound that comes in around 2:00, that would sound great if it just went in off of that  the outro beat works better than the rest, but then the mixing of the vocals don't work for me as well. i think at this point it would sound great if you copied the vocals and pitched them down, and fix the reverb/add some delay"

The piano outro at the end feels a little awkward and out of nowhere."

makinghiphop,3e4cy6,aflasa,4,Tue Jul 21 21:26:35 2015 UTC,"What're you're actually looking to do is master your tracks.  If you've mixed your tracks and you like they way then sound then ""bounce"" them down. Basically, make a stereo .wav track.  Then re-import those tracks into your DAW on a single stereo track. Then apply effects (compression, EQ) to the master buss to get the levels up. Be careful with your compression. When mixing you want to ""hear"" your compression sometimes, but mastering is all about minor adjustments. Get everything sounding as good as you can without touching the master buss in the mix, then move to mastering.  Don't do it all at once.  My advice, depending upon how serious you are about the tape and how much disposable income you've got, is to send your mixes to a mastering engineer for them to work their magic. They have crazy good gear and it's worth every penny."
makinghiphop,3e4cy6,seanithanegan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:22:27 2015 UTC,I suppose an exported/ mixdown .wav file is the same as having the session up and doing mastering... on the master... but is there another reason i'm not thinking about?
makinghiphop,3e4cy6,leeeeland,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:16:17 2015 UTC,"Both methods are identical audio wise but there are a few reasons you might export to a single wav file;  1 some people like to see the entire track waveform just so they have an ""overview"" and it can help more visually show any strange peaks or dips in volume or odd panning, 2 simply just to free up CPU and ram that plugins and tracks were taking up in the main project since mastering plugins can be pretty cpu intensive.  There's probably a couple more reasons but I can't think of any right now."
makinghiphop,3e4cy6,taxonmusic,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:26:30 2015 UTC,GOOD CALL.
makinghiphop,3e4cy6,leeeeland,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:58:48 2015 UTC,"Try utilizing multiple compressors on individual elements (as well as groups of tracks) to increase perceived volume (ie reducing gigantic transient peaks and increasing sustain. If the levels are more balanced when it gets to the final limiter, you can do more with degrading less. I try to get my tracks to ""naturally"" hover around -3db on the master track before compression/EQ/limiting. Then use your limiter to limit dynamic range and get the meat of your mix closer to 0db as opposed to primarily your transients. In Soundcloud, check out their sound waves vs yours and you'll see a much more compressed file overall without sounding that way. Good luck."

Turns out the vast majority of them have one plain picture while a dope beat is playing in the background. Some even have more than one one plain picture with very slow zoom in/zoom out effects on.    Do you think it would be enough to have just a cool graphic to show while the beat is playing or should there be more to it ?   I'm no expert on this field, but I think you should look into just doing what you're doing. Haha jk jk. Seriously though all I suggest is to fade out from your intro graphic into another visually appealing pic. Maybe more if you'd like. A slow zoom in/zoom out effect (if you can manage it) would be cool too.  A quick YouTube search is all you need to see that you should put more focus on producing than trying to learn how to do dope videos. With that being said I suggest looking at various Windows Movie Maker tut vids (basic intro of the functions, tips and tricks, etc) and do something simple. No need to go overboard.

I always had trouble using any sort of sample with rhythm and texture changes, trying to get that nice emphasized stutter, and this somewhat helped me alleviate it.  tl;dr -> possible scrub method, tap out pattern using sample and then fit beat around that."

Then he goes to add fragments of a loop atop the drum pattern.  The vocal you hear is a part of that loop assigned to  a pad.  He is tapping that pad and recording it in time to the basic drum pattern he has already laid down.   An easy way to approach this is to begin with the loop or the small part of the loop.  Let's call this a sample.  You take the sample and stretch it to 1 bar.  You can do this buy changing the tempo of the project to match the tempo of the sample.  Or, you can time-stretch the sample into 1 bar of the loop.   Then you can add your elements of a break-beat, atop your loop."

Some of my favorite songs are one's where the artist rides the beat rather than just hits the drums every time   How do they do that? Emulate it when you find the answer. Look at all of the artist you listen to. Learn how they flow. Steel their flow and add your own twist. Listen to artists you've never listen to, try to incorporate that flow. Get all these flows and try to combine them adding your own twists. Try to create your own flows if you're stuck in the same loop.  How to do that?  Listen to the beat and let it direct you, match your voice and flow to the beat. If an instrument is slowing down, you slow down. If it's rapid, flow rapidly. Stray from the instrument/beat as well, control the track or flow harmoniously with it, your choice.  Instead of rapping then stopping after every bar, rap and keep going on to the next stopping after the second, third, or even fourth bar if you can. Alternate.  I have an exercise for you. Find a boom bap beat, I'm talking straight drums and loop, and flow/change your delivery as many times as you can for that beat.   ***Edit: I'm talking switch after every bar or two if you can, goooood practice. I'll try to find the cypher (Thanks to IBR) where this literally was a theme, listen to those entrants and try to do it yourself. Edit: Here you go    Heres a good example of this  Pay attention to how they use their words to switch their flow and delivery (especially the first guy), switching schemes constantly to change that flow. You don't need to do it as constantly as these guys on an actual track, but I want you to try it on a boom bap beat for practice. Once you get thst down, coming up with flows for progressive tracks should be easy asf for you.  Personally I don't think it's difficult, just force yourself to curve if you find yourself drawing straight if you catch my drift."

makinghiphop,3e3s0p,hiphopent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:51:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help! I do have some follow up questions, if you could help, that would be awesome!  So, the copy of ableton I had wasn't exactly legit and ended up not working... I now find myself with a working copy of Reason. I got an interface and successfully sampled my first record! Do you know how I can get this .wav into Reason, split it up, and assign it to pads on my MPD?   Thanks again!"
makinghiphop,3e3s0p,omgburritos,2,Wed Jul 22 01:56:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely get an interface. I have an M-Audio M-Box. It's basic and pretty much all you need. I also suggest a Roland SP-404 (or a SP-303 if you can find one). The on-board effects makes it fun to play around with, especially if you're using Ableton as your DAW."
makinghiphop,3e3s0p,hiphopent,2,Tue Jul 21 20:05:30 2015 UTC,"I got an interface and sampled my first record!! Thanks! Those roland samples look sweet, unfortunately I don't have the $$$ right now :("
makinghiphop,3e3s0p,omgburritos,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:57:20 2015 UTC,"Are they good for making beats? I know nothing about them, they look so different than the mpc's"
makinghiphop,3e3s0p,hiphopent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:49:36 2015 UTC,They're very different. I think they're great for simple 4-16 bar loops. I like using them (I have a 404sx and a 303) when I dont feel like touching a computer. All you need to do is load some drum samples on the SD card and plug your turntable straight into it to sample stuff. The compressor sounds really good on it too. It really makes your beats bump harder. Combining one with Ableton would be cool because its hard to structure a song properly with just the SP.

makinghiphop,3e160c,donnowheretogo,6,Tue Jul 21 15:28:12 2015 UTC,"I would love some feedback on the mixing of this track.  I made the beat, recorded the vocals and mixed it. Feedback on the beat/raps are great too (the rappers are my friends so I can relay it) but specifically I want to improve my mixing.   Edit: I will definitely return feedback as well."
makinghiphop,3e160c,thenomadbeats,4,Tue Jul 21 15:26:55 2015 UTC,"The eq and levels are pretty good for the most part. Effects are cool and don't detract from audibility. Sibilance was occasionally an issue and so was background noise. High pass could solve the latter and a bit more time sweeping frequencies will greatly help the former. I think some reverb or delay might help the vocals sound more wet and fit in the beat better.  Rapping was solid, nothing to complain about. A tad bit more emphasis on emotion in the hook might improve that track."
makinghiphop,3e160c,deviantzen,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:09 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks man, I appreciate it. Can you elaborate on how I would use a high pass to address background noise?   I don't see anything posted here, but if you have something you want feedback on, lemme know."
makinghiphop,3e160c,thenomadbeats,3,Tue Jul 21 17:36:28 2015 UTC,"The shuffling and bumps are often in the low ranges due to the vibrations of the mic itself. This is a very mix by ear thing, since you don't want to lose too much warmth in the vocal, but try high passing around 140 in the main and 250 in the backing vocals and see if it sounds better."
makinghiphop,3e160c,deviantzen,4,Tue Jul 21 17:48:24 2015 UTC,"funny, your situation is like the same as mine. mostly everything I post up here is a beat I made, that my friends rap on, that I mix and master. anyway, the vocal sounds like it could use some softening.. the high mids are a bit much.. did you use a de esser at all? also, did you use a reference track when you mixed? if not, I would definitely recommend finding a mix you want to set as a standard, and try to make it sound like theirs. it's a great way to find a direction when you're working on improving mixing (saying from first hand experience)"

I love the instrumentation. the drums are a little too ""acoustic"" sounding for what I picture behind the wall of chaos going on in the lead. it's fucking dope. I think some kind of swing or humanization (make it sound like a real player) would make the acoustic sounding samples fit a bit more. I love the potential of this beat. nice work!"

I'm not listening with the best headphones right now, but I think the kick would sound better if it was a little more deep; a little more punchy. Maybe if the whole track had more bass it would sound more like clams casino style (which would be dope!). Nonetheless keep up the great work"

makinghiphop,3e160c,renninninefive,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:09:53 2015 UTC,"hey thots  really nice intro, it had me anticipating for sure. vocals should be louder  your delivery seemed to fall off when you run out of breath man, do more takes. it's half tight and half kinda bad right now tbh."

makinghiphop,3e160c,blackkyle__,2,Tue Jul 21 07:27:10 2015 UTC,"i think it took a little too long for the beat to kick in, since the drum beat is very sparse it made it feel kinda empty before the vocal chops (dope btw!!) came in, and almost got that feeling again before the bassline dropped. however, as soon as your vocal started it felt at home. the chorus feels very nice, but could possibly use another instrument that fills up the spectrum a little bit, strings f.ex. feels like its missing some treble in that part to really make it ""pop"". the song in itself is dope tho!"
makinghiphop,3e160c,b0go,2,Tue Jul 21 07:42:27 2015 UTC,This is dope dude. I just think that the drum intro is a bit long (maybe make it 2 bars??) but other than that this is really clean.

makinghiphop,3e160c,TheHound585,2,Tue Jul 21 11:03:38 2015 UTC,"I think the beat is pretty cool, but if you hi passed the second set of synths until like :42 it would make that drop go way harder. I think with some arrangement work this would be incredible. I'm digging it. the hat panning is pretty dope but I could see bringing it down a bit. depends what the vocals are doing on top. this is awesome, seriously. it's worth digging in to the arrangement to make this the best it can be, in my opinion."

makinghiphop,3e160c,NeedMoreStaals,3,Tue Jul 21 13:16:33 2015 UTC,"I thought the flow was good overall man, nice work. There were a few parts where your breathing sticks out.  You can automate the volume down a bit to make them less noticeable, but some people don't like to remove them completely because it makes it sound less natural.   at 1:05 it sounds like you punched in and I can hear the breath from the preceding punch, which you might want to cut out. Also happens at 2:38. Overall good track though."
makinghiphop,3e160c,thenomadbeats,2,Tue Jul 21 15:33:53 2015 UTC,"if you don't like fun fuck yourself. A+  flow is nice. the beat is pretty dope too. I think the vocal should be brought way up. the snare fill is a significant amount louder than the lead vocal at the same time (:38). did you make the beat too? the flow is pretty dope, but it just doesn't pop like it should because it's too quiet. this is pretty hot though, your lyrics are solid. nice job"

makinghiphop,3e160c,badtaylor,2,Tue Jul 21 04:07:35 2015 UTC,thanks for the response. im hoping to find a vocalist for it to flesh it out and add some more flair and variation to it. thanks!
makinghiphop,3e160c,oblivbokyaku,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:11:00 2015 UTC,"Samba  This beat is a real head knocker. The kick might be a little too airy and boomy though. The rhodes that come in half way though was an awesome touch. It's a little repetitive to stay as an instrumental but with a good rapper, this would be fire.  Peach  Nice lo fi feel to it. That sample is mad chill. I'm not a huge fan of that reverse cymbal build up. It sounds a little cheesey on this beat. I would also add more change ups to keep it from coming repetitive."

I could definitely take an album like this, good job. not too crazy about your hats, maybe something a little looser and more low-key might fit better, but that's mostly a nitpick (and I really hate being the dude that just says ""good stuff"" and moves on too)"
makinghiphop,3e160c,insecuregorilla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:26:47 2015 UTC,"haha you zeroed in on the only sequenced part of that beat. you're right, thanks for pointing that out."
makinghiphop,3e160c,badtaylor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:35:33 2015 UTC,Everything about the instrumentation is awesome! It kind of has a early 2000's rnb feel to it. I don't think the drums really match the sounds though. The static hi hat pattern doesn't fit how human everything else feels. The chorus is pretty good but nothing crazy. I'm curious to hear the rest of the song.
makinghiphop,3e160c,Blakefred,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:37:06 2015 UTC,haha i'm curious too because that's all i've got so far

I feel like some percussion here or there could go a long way in spicing it up though, maybe trying varying the individuals hits up some more in terms of velocity too, right now your drums feel very stiff, they don't float like they could. the pattern itself still works tho, so I dig. Keep it up dude, you've got talent  side quip that's almost more preference than anything but with sample beats like this, unless you've got a ton of variety and samples and etc shorter is usually better. I kept it on the whole 4 mins so points for that, but in general i'd veer towards smaller lil beats"
makinghiphop,3e160c,insecuregorilla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:11:00 2015 UTC,https://soundcloud.com/get_guet/the-greats  I've done some pretty unusual sampling for this one. Looking for every type of feedback!

If I need to nitpick, I would say a nice 808 clap on the snare could beef it up some more, but the snare still works for me. good stuff"
makinghiphop,3e160c,insecuregorilla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:13:55 2015 UTC,this is sick.  you did a great job and not mudding up your mix and really let those samples do the work.  69/69

makinghiphop,3e160c,FrostedPoptart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:32:52 2015 UTC,dude this is tight.  i started using ableton about 6 months ago and it took me much longer than a month to get a mix half this clean.     now some negative shit.  your kicks almost sound like they're off tempo or something.  did you use a drum machine?  i would suggest layering and compressin both the kick and the snare.  the kick doesnt have much of a punch and the snare is very soft.  adding some claps to that boy and perhaps some reverb would do alot.  good work tho

makinghiphop,3e160c,Benstillerfagget,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:13:33 2015 UTC,"This beat has promise, but it's not cut well.  The instruments work well together, but there's no emotion to them, maybe some down pitching or bit crushing to dirty it up a bit.   The drums are generic and sound like place holders, try new sounds or some compression.  Please work on this, it has promise, it could end up being a really emotional, plodding sort of beat."

makinghiphop,3e160c,Sleepy_Head94,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:14:52 2015 UTC,"The percussion sounds a bit programmed. They could use a bit of swing, some light off grid placement and some variation on velocity. Layering them and slightly pitching one layer up or down aldo gives that little bit of off feel to it.  I think the structure could also use some variation. Introduce some elements and then take them out or combine them at parts. The glitch effects are good to spice up things, but I feel like they don't really have a purpose to lead anywhere."

makinghiphop,3e160c,PoTheGod,2,Tue Jul 21 05:19:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think your flow fits the beat very well, but that will come with practice.   Some dudes like to find the flow they want to use before they write to the beat, like just by mumbling (and sometimes even recording a mumbling track for reference), then you have to go back and fill in the lyrics. So work on sitting with the beat, finding the groove, and picking a flow that really complements it rather than just flowing over it."

I think in the context of this particular beat, you did everything well. Personally, I'd increase the gain on the limiter, saturate the kicks a little more and definitely bring up the snares.  It all depends, however.  thanks for the love tho brud :-)"

makinghiphop,3e160c,having2ndthots,2,Tue Jul 21 07:10:22 2015 UTC,"no complaints on the beat really. it all sounds pretty clean and well put together. But i might consider reworking your producer tag. Its a little off putting and in this particular track, its a little loud."
makinghiphop,3e160c,dukiejbv,2,Tue Jul 21 07:30:01 2015 UTC,"This is dope. At around 34 secs I would bring another synth in to switch it up, I think you actually added one at the end there. I suggest bringing that one in at 34 secs, my producer sense just really wants something to come in at 34 secs, just bring it in at 34 secs lol. Nice work though the mix sounds good I just feel like the mid high end is a little empty."

makinghiphop,3e1f8p,winnershnitzel,5,Tue Jul 21 05:33:24 2015 UTC,"what is the struggle?  confidence? memorization issues? pronunciation? vocalization?  the answer is most likely practice, but it's gonna be tough for anybody to give you a solution without you more clearly expressing the problem.  i mean if the problem is that you don't like the sound of your voice then that's completely different than if you're writing lyrics that are more complicated than what you're able to recite.  ya dig?"

Rap to yourself.  Rap to all of your friends.  Rap to strangers.  All of this until you have no fear of anybody hearing you.  (He worded it way better and more inspirationally.)  Also, if you are not confident enough to rap the words that you're writing then it's possible that you might be writing the wrong words, y'know. It might be that the confidence is not there because you're writing words that don't fit your soul.  I wish I could be more helpful, but..."

makinghiphop,3e1f8p,hiphopent,2,Tue Jul 21 21:56:22 2015 UTC,"What are you having trouble with?   TL;DR   Use simpler rhymes Practice breath control, lose unnecessary/awkward words Experiment with different voices, inflections   1) Speed/clarity of pronunciations?  Maybe the rhymes you're starting off with are too hard? I'd start with some simpler, slower rhymes and then build from there.   English is my third language and as someone who just started 2 months ago (bought Mic + Audio Interface in May), I've realized the importance of choosing words carefully so as to minimize facial muscle tension and watch out for extremely ""tense"" syllables being close together (like an ""f"" that's followed by a ""v"" sound).  Watch out for unnecessary/awkwardly placed articles & prepositions like ""the"", ""a"", ""of."" In some instances, you can skip over or shorten their pronunciation.  I started slow and simple and now at my 8th song (none complete, all 8 in diff stages), I'm much more clear, and can rap a little faster. Still far ways to go but I can already notice a little improvement.  2) Running out of breath?  Building from easier rhymes with breathing exercises, along with recording 4-8 bars at a time should help.  Overtime, you'll notice that you can spit a 16 without losing breath. This just takes practice!  3) Don't like the sound of your voice?  Experimentation is all you can do here. Try invoking an emotion when you record. Focus on inflections. Emphasize important syllables.  Try different voices. I can sound really monotone so I'm trying to work on animating myself a bit more. Singing (aka butchering) your hooks helps!"

makinghiphop,3e1f8p,thegoatishere,2,Tue Jul 21 05:42:08 2015 UTC,"Chiming in, all the best sounding verses are edited and spliced together. In fact, it's probably better for workflow to get good at recording in a way that's more conducive to editing than to actually practice recording in one take. You'll never get it 100% perfect, and the time is better spent elsewhere. Software is great, use it!"
makinghiphop,3e1f8p,deviantzen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:48 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile I like to do one takes because it forces me to practice harder. Although punching in saves a lot of time, I'm at a point where practice is key, so that time I'm not saving goes towards much needed practice. It's also good preparation for when I want to perform live haha, I can't punch in a live performance (unless I lip sync....)!  I mean it doesn't really matter tbh, punch in or dont, anyones choice."

makinghiphop,3e1f8p,TerminallyTrill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:26:05 2015 UTC,"Hard to say while I don't know what your struggle exactly is.  When i finished writing my lyrics I record them while reading them from paper. (This isn't recommended for a final product, but read on!). Afterwards I put the track on my phone and listen the shit out of it while I'm on my way, to remember the lyrics and find parts, which could be improved (Choice of words, emphasis, etc.). Don't push yourself too hard with this, and take your time. After I found a bunch of parts which can be improved, I record the track again (At this point, you should be able to memorize the lyrics). Then I repeat the previous steps until I'm quite happy with the result."
