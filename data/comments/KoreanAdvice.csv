If yi has not walked into your jungle, get boots + as many wards as you can. If he is in your jungle, get a dmg item + pots.  ward up and wait for him in a bush to clear a camp. yi is unlikely to gank (no gap closers [unless youre in bronze and they use q as gap closer instead of a dodge/execute]) smite steal and run away. using your wards plan your way back in and repeat until you need pots/wards   AD le blanc jungle works best."

KoreanAdvice,31tnaz,TsuyoiNoHideki,6,Wed Apr 8 01:48:03 2015 UTC,Why kill everything in your lane when you can proxy farm to kill everything in all three lanes?
KoreanAdvice,31tnaz,pierifle,3,Wed Apr 8 06:35:48 2015 UTC,"Might as well kill the champions as they spawn too, if you're gonna proxy farm"
KoreanAdvice,31tnaz,marlor47,1 point,Wed Apr 8 07:06:03 2015 UTC,"Or, if you are playing a champion like Ziggs, Xerath, or Gangplank, you can use your ult to clear the wave from afar. You'll still be able to get kills in the lane you are roaming to without it."
KoreanAdvice,31q4ic,Teddy_Treebark,29,Tue Apr 7 07:36:54 2015 UTC,I am confused. Do we need to create a smurf for diamond to use this trick?
