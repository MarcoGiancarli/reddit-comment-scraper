People were lined up 2-3 hours outside in hot, humid weather, most standing in the sun with no shade, waiting to get in.

While campaigns like Bernie's and Ron Paul's certainly attract a few Reddit revolutionaries whose primary motivation is feeling righteous and arch in meaningless internet arguments, I'd still say that, without a doubt, the main reason those campaigns don't make huge splashes is because of just how dominated the American 'middle' is by the major parties.

Racism in America (and the British colonies, hell all the colonies in the new world) has economic roots. The discontent of the lower classes in colonial America necessitated the creation of a method of controlling this huge population for the continued exploitation by the property holding classes (back when agriculture was America's super industry). Conscripting the white part of this population into the apparatus of control by giving them the privilege of being poor, but at least white, pretty much stopped white unrest in colonial America.

That's like me telling a bunch of Eastern Europeans that anti-Roma prejudices are not a problem because I've never seen them, without mentioning that I'm an American and there are no Roma people in the USA.  This entire argument is generally occurring within an American context, or at least within the context of a country which has a history of plantation slavery and racist laws and prejudices which grew over this economic base to justify it.  And Canada is probably the only colony in the new world to escape this curse due to its climate.    But since you mentioned that you are a Canadian who says s/he has no racial privilege, we can re-run my entire thought experiment but replace ""black people"" with ""First Nations people"".  Given the higher poverty rates, alcoholism rates, and lower educational and economic achievement of First Nations people, would you rather be born white or First Nations in Canada if you were behind the veil of ignorance, meaning that you had no foreknowledge of your eventual sexual/socioeconomic position (other than your ethnicity in this case).

Is being a dead white person better than being a living black one or something?

Gen X kids were basically raised by wolves. By and large, Boomer parents in the late 60's and early 70's were still sleeping off their drug fueled binges and we basically had to raise ourselves. We are mistrustful of authority and organized movements. We are self-sufficent nomads who feel outnumbered by the generations that come before and after. When authority or counter-culture rises up we skitter to the sidelines to watch and find our niche to thrive between the cracks.  We don't make the rules, and we don't have the means to fight the power, so we figure out the rules and find our way to survive as best we can. Many of us kowtow to Boomers in charge and have made our way to middle management and wait for the final wave of Boomer retirements to get our own share of the pie for a few short years before we also head off into retirement.  Because we play nice with the Boomers, we are more likely to get some of the spoils. There will be something still left for us in retirement plans and medical insurance, and we were provided with generous loans from the financial industry (while it still works) and through inter-generational transfer from older boomers (e.g. parents) who decided to curtail some of their spending habits before it's all gone. So in general, we don't have the same crushing student debt.  If you learn anything from us, find a way to work within the system.

Your ""hard ass, straight-talking"" cynicism works really well when convincing Gen Xers to do things.  It doesn't work for Millennials.  It's discouraging.  It's depressing.  We don't see the world the way you do.  And most of us absolutely do not hate you.  We tend to see Xers as pretty cool.  You'll notice, if you look, that all y'all's fashions are back in style.  We see you all as the cool older brother/sister, the one who knows all the ins & outs and is a survivor.  BUT, we are not as distrusting as you.  We are not as jaded.  A lot of us grew up with our (mostly Boomer) parents telling us that we could have the world, and we believed them.  In the 90s, Homer Simpson said, ""Don't trust anyone over 30.""  But we didn't listen.  We thought adults knew what they were doing.  When we couldn't get a good job, we felt like we must be the fuck-ups.  So many of us - in our mid-to-late-20s now - are just now beginning to wake up and see the structural mess we're in.  It's hard for us to blame our parents.  It's hard for me to say to my dad, ""Why didn't you tell me not to follow my dreams?  To do something practical so I could put food on the table?""  It feels cruel.  We wanted to believe the dream too.  But we're getting there.  If you want to talk to us in a language we understand, I suggest you first start with this essay on the basics of Millennial thought.  Then read about how Happy Is the New Edgy.  Think about how you can combine the best of your talents (straight talk, realism, pragmatism, experience) with the messages that work best for us (optimism, leadership, step-by-step instructions, encouragement, feedback, praise).  Try it not just with people online, but with Millennials you know in real life.  You guys are the leaders in the coming revolution.  Millennials are the foot soldiers, and we're willing and ready when you are."

lostgeneration,3dx595,JustJonny,7,Mon Jul 20 11:49:30 2015 UTC,"While voting is the least effective way to create political change, it's also the easiest, so any degree of political activity should start there.   When you read that and conclude   if you truly believe voting is of more importance than local education, organization, fund raising and public awareness, you've got a exactly the complacent mentality you're supposed to have, that the broken system depends on to keep it afloat.   it sounds like you're more interested in feeling superior than actually effecting change.  If your idea of expressing dissent is trying to shock politicians with low voter turnout, I think that you might be the complacent one who's the sort the broken system needs to keep it afloat.  I don't see what you hope to accomplish via education, organization, fund raising or public awareness if you don't do anything with it.  If you want to get laws changed, you have to change the people making the laws, or make those making the laws scared that you'll do so.  All of those things should be directed at getting more people to vote, or at least create the appearance of doing so.  All the protests in the world won't accomplish jack shit if it doesn't make office holders afraid to lose their jobs, or better yet, actually make them lose their jobs.  Ultimately, that's always going to come down to either voting, or outright revolution, and we're a long way short of a revolution."

He has a long political career of actually fighting to help the middle class and his message has been consistent throughout his career. He is also someone that his constituents like. He goes out and meets people he runs into folks in a coffee shop in his home district and takes the time to talk to them. Not in a staged for the camera way in a legitimate I care what you think way. You want a candidate that wants to help Americans he is it.   He reaches across the aisle, has principles and is introducing legislation RIGHT NOW as a Senator that tells you exactly what his campaign is going to be about. I really didn't get the Obama draw in '08 the guy stood for nothing but did it with Charisma. Bernie won't take super PAC dollars and stands for the common man as he has for 30 years. He is the one candidate that wants to take big money back out of the political process and put it back in the hands of the people.   In the end the President only has so  much power. This is why Bernie talks about a political revolution. A vote for Bernie sends a message that America is willing to go a different way. America needs to back that up by putting other officials into congress that want that too. I urge you to look into what he has done over the years and what he wants to accomplish. It is hard to think he will be Obama 2.0 after that."

But this sub, and the usual suspect that support these bozos think they will be the ones to be receiving the ""free"" shit, so they don't care about how many others get hurt for them.    “A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the majority discovers it can vote itself largess out of the public treasury.

Here's why some of my friends are still working: the pension systems they had (including mine), Defined Benefit Plans, were essentially raided by their employers and replaced with 401k style DIY pension plans. Pensions that were guaranteed now suddenly lost value in the 2008 crash, they are now subject to fees and commissions and market fluctuation.   The story of Faberge' is just one of thousands of examples; other companies, salivating over those pools of pension monies, would take over the the smaller company, raid the pension funds and rework the retirement plans.   Remember the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" hero pilot? ""Sullenberger, a 58-year-old who joined a US Airways predecessor in 1980, told the House aviation subcommittee that his pay has been cut 40 percent in recent years and his pension has been terminated and replaced with a promise ""worth pennies on the dollar"" from the federally created Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp."" Note that the executive officers of his airline got to keep their full pensions.  With Defined Benefit pensions having gone the way of the Passenger Pigeon, having sucked those pension funds dry, they are now salivating over your Social Security. They want that money to play with at your expense.   Some of my friends have to keep working to make it to Medicare age, they cannot afford to retire with no medical benefits.

Progressive Washington sees drugs as a medical problem, not criminal.  Progressives want to stop shredding black families. Progressives even want police to stop unfairly ticketing black men for marijuana use. To be clear: we haven't had this legal for a year and we already know black men get 90% of the tickets.  We do have a challenge to figure out in Washington on this issue: we don't allow smoking in public buildings and we also don't want anybody smoking in public outside.

What a lot of black people are bothered by is the underlying racism that some progressives have that manifest as microaggressions. You can be all well and for economic improvement but still be quick to believe that an unarmed black male who was shot in the back was threatening to an officer. Someone does not necessarily have to stand for both racial and economic improvement.   Also, we're tired of being told that we have to vote one way or another just because someone pays lip service to one of our issues, only for that candidate to ignore our issues while in office. You can't expect a demographic to simply fall rank in file if there's no perceived benefit.   Some might say that candidates who do this are not true progressives, but the only way to identify a progressive is by their rhetoric and self-proclaimed ideology if they don't have a track record, so I think some skepticism is warranted.  That being said, I do think Sanders specifically has a decent history of actively supporting racial equality, so i find the blowback he's receiving unwarranted.

The whole reason people have checked out of politics worldwide is because politicians pay nothing but lip service to workers' plight while kissing the ass of the ruling class.

UBI won't change a damn thing if the means of production aren't in the control of the people.

We live in a world where ideals aren't passed down from parents, but can be found in any show oriented at kids. Ads target kids for the sake of imprinting branding, schools are a business venture, art quality sacrificed to appeal to the masses, and increasing wealth disparity all cause us to live in a less than ""real"" world, one focused more on our conceptual horses of economy and superiority than on the raw structure of a society.   No longer are we bound by the physical world, we buy imaginary products (coughleagueoflegendscough) with imaginary money (gold standard doesn't real), at imaginary prices (products often go on arbitrary sales on Amazon, Steam, and more), not for the product, but because we're conditioned that it makes us feel good, but even further, because we WANT shit we don't need or even want (or even tangibly exists) due to the power of (tinfoil hat time) being conditioned to believe it's all real life. After all, Wall Street is full of the most successful people in America buying, selling, and trading a currency that has no real basis, and profiting raw gains off of an equal trade.

It's how Clinton denied him a second term, through ""it's the economy stupid"".  At the time, I kept seeing fresh college graduates getting stuck with boring secretarial work and thinking, ""this is bad. How did this happen?""  Then Clinton came in and eviscerated the military, and the defense contractor employees were freed up and the commercial Internet was born from its previous military and research use, and it boosted the economy.  That was a one-time thing, though, because now automation destroys more jobs than it creates.  So lostgeneration is merely the completion of what was started in the early 90s, interrupted by the dot-com and housing bubbles, and overshadowed by 9-11 and the Global War on Terror.

But the reality that we actually live in is one of increasing inequality, it's an important difference.  A culture of poor people is inherently different to a culture of inequality.  When everyone is poor, then it's just accepted, as we're all in it together and there's nothing to be ashamed of.  But when it's unequal, people can lash out at eachother, desperate to escape their comparatively low social status, ie: crab mentality.  It can erode trust and altruism within the community, encouraging everyone to desperately maintain a facade, like in the story ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". That was what i really liked about the movie Slacker, it portrayed a culture where everyone was keeping it real.  You really felt like you could just walk upto anyone in the movie and unpretentiously have a conversation about anything, without feeling that you were going to offend them or be attacked.

Just because Google has self driving cars and Amazon has robot pickers doesn't mean therefore that millions of people will be displaced, it's really speculation and some big assumptions about the future that may or may not pan out. I think it's more fantasy talk, as we've had the same stories about automation for decades, and they never panned out.  Productivity has always increased steadily, and you don't make any connection there. Increasing productivity doesn't make people unemployed.  It has more to do w/ baby boomers retiring, and people not entering the labor force. It could partly be that overseas workers are displacing American ones, so wages here are so low that people don't think it's worth it.

lostgeneration,3du8tg,lackofcoherence,5,Sun Jul 19 22:48:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Personally, i think it has more to do with Corporate Culture than anything else.  Automation of labor is an enabling technology, sure, but i don't see it as the inherent cause of the problem.  Looking at the skyrocketing trend of CEO paychecks, while worker wages decrease, that's the problem: a culture within the investment community which finds that acceptable.  The Corporate Culture which dominates our society atm could be said to be an inevitable consequence of Capitalism (ie: Capitalism is therefore the base problem).

For them collapse already happened. Or the people getting cancer to build electronics that we can enjoy for a few years before sending them back so they can get more cancer trying to rip apart the boards to get the precious metals out of them. They're living in collapse. Or the families we've fucked up with drone strikes to keep the region destabilized so that we can further the petrodollar's agenda, an entire foreign policy built around exporting the collapse for as long as we can.  When the market corrects again, sure, me and you and some of the people we know could see some drops in our standard of living but to wait until that specific moment to decide collapse is actually happening seems needlessly specific.   Neither money nor resources are distributed uniformly and consistently so why would their lack be any more consistent or uniform? Just because there is a global market and the internet does not mean we all participate in it equally and are affected by it equally. Wall street imploding would be a big deal, don't get me wrong, but for some people it would probably improve their situation.

Most people think technology and the free market will save us, but I'm very skeptical of that assumption.

Yankees will weather the storm, the Left Coast stands a chance, I absolutely fear for Appalachia and the Deep South.   More importantly, the World3 model utterly bypasses the 'Tyranny factors.' A regional despot would solve alot of the problems. This is the 'other factor' that isn't considered, because Boomers are frankly too spoiled to consider it. And this is what questions my mind, just as much as regionaliztion.   Joseph Stalin would utterly disintegrate the trends, by using unthinkable options, such as lowering per capita consumption through Gulags, population reductions through political crimes, and absolutely brutal industry per capita raises through overwork. There are even more options, like surplus population elimination through 'Viking raids' or outright annexation of resources from other places. Nearly all his measures would translate successfully to a post-climate change world. Soviet-style tyranny would do quite well in a post-capitalist world.  I want none of this. On the damn record.  The collapse will look like Attila Total War. Some places will disappear off the map. Entire races will go extinct. But for other places, life will go on. And then civilization will return from those survivors."

Anarchists mostly want to be w/o leaders, I don't think anything else really goes.   Are you saying that in tough times we will def need leaders? I'm not so sure about that, seems like smaller groups will have a good chance, and those are likely to be very top heavy organizations.   I'm a little skeptical of direct democracy working, seems like people are forcing that somewhat. I do like the idea of having more participation, no reason you can't still have rules and boot people out who aren't carrying their weight. I don't think anarchism would really solve a lot of problems, you'd still have the same issues as w/ having leaders."
lostgeneration,3du1nr,lackofcoherence,2,Mon Jul 20 18:47:30 2015 UTC,"no reason you can't still have rules and boot people out who aren't carrying their weight   I have never personally encountered an Anarchist who understood this. But radical inclusion isn't a feature of Anarchism, either. Because our version of 'Anarchism' isn't actually 'Anarchism.'  In fact, I use the term Anarchism as short-hand for Libertarian Socialism. Although most try to specify themselves with their own 'brand,' in reality, most are all parrots of Noam's vision of ""Anarchism.""  So Noam Chomsky's vision of Anarchism cannot boot people for dropping their own weight, especially because they'll use 'intersectionality' to describe how their faults is actually your fault. Noam Chomsky wedged radical acceptance into left politics, and this created disastrous results.    Imagine if OWS splintered into a thousand groups, rather than try to wedge themselves into one disorganized mess.   Likewise, nearly all conseratives may give themselves a specific flavor of their brand, nearly all parrot the Mont Perelin Society. Most of their beliefs began in the 40s, where Karl Popper and Friedreich Hayek worked very hard to make Capitalism sexy again. (Friedman was the one who triumphed, though.)  But again. Most Anarchists are so ignorant that they aren't even aware that their own version of Anarchism is peculiar to the 1960s. Hell, the most successful version of Anarchism was actually the Monastery Orders of the Early Dark ages, which held tremendous power, while being based on nonviolence, communalism, and compassion to others.  TLDR: The word 'Anarchism' is a misnomer in the 21st century, and should translate something akin to 'Radical Acceptance' more so than 'Anti-Leaders.'

I still agree w/ a lot of what anarchists say, but they don't have much coherent vision of how things work. However, I think a lot of people are ok w/ that, they just don't want leaders. If the message was just to do away w/ leaders and getting rid of the threat of things like state violence, I'd be all for it. Communities should have more power, and this would actually hurt some people now who are super selfish and really living off of other people.  In a more community centered world, people who are super rude to everyone will be in trouble. People who don't care about anyone beyond their own family and friends will be in trouble. People who expect other people to do everything for them and pay their own way will be in trouble. All these people who lounge around on the streets will be in trouble."

Any legitimate challenger will be met with every hurdle, including outright voting fraud, to insure that they never earn the position.

There's plenty of stupid anti-union propaganda out there, but the propaganda about the unions being just blue collar joes democratically fighting for the working man is just as ubiquitous among left-leaning types.

Easy for companies and it terminates the existing union contracts. They are now trying out the bankruptcy idea for cities, countries, states, etc.   By the way, I am not particularly pro-union. It's an incredibly complicated system to support higher wages and it takes a crazy long time to build it. I am absolutely in support of higher wages. The first time around in the US, unions went from illegal (1870s) to finally accepted (1930s). The union movement actually spurred the creation of the modern police force. Violent labor unrest existed for SIX DECADES before unions were finally normalized. The incredible complexity? It is hundreds of thousands of contracts that are individually negotiated. The college educated boomers of 1980 were the first of the paycheck class to land in industries without unions. That 5 or 10 percent of the population gave their votes to the business guys because that is who they thought they were--business people. The dumbasses didn't even realize... OH!

The fact is the unions pretty much universally responded to the pressures of globalization and the post-1980 political shifts by tossing any association with class conflict and trade union struggle out the window and jumping in bed with corporate management and the state (corporatism), on the grounds that union-management 'partnerships' were the way to insure profitability and the survival of the union itself. It's universally acknowledged that's meant concession after concession after concession (on wages, benefits, jobs, everything) from the unions.  You can literally count on one hand the number of nationally prominent strikes (most of them blatantly sold out by the union leaderships themselves) over the last couple decades, compared with pretty much the entire history of US industrial capitalism when strikes were a constant feature of the economic and political scene.

Chrysler, under Lee Iacoca, threatened the country with bankruptcy and received a government bailout. At that time Chrysler was like the 10th largest company. At that time, in that place, calling for a general strike would have been the equivalent of lining up in the street to be shot.  Considering the reduction in number of people in unions, I find it slightly amazing that they have continued to be part of the discussion at all. After PATCO in 1982 it was open season on unions--and there was close to zero public support for keeping them. Please also consider that these were the years when Mitt ""47%"" Romney was honing his chops as a bona fide union buster for wall street. Bankruptcy is the actual mechanism of 'creative destruction' and it is legally binding. All the while, people were agreeing to vote for the guys doing the creative destruction. Elections matter.  It was a very bad mistake made by a poorly informed public--but it was the choice that people made. Meanwhile, did you know that the United Auto Workers were spending their money in 1998 to try and help grad students that had become trapped in sub minimum wage employment as TAs and adjuncts in large universities? Yes, there were strikes. By my count, there have actually been ZERO nationally prominent strikes during 35 years--but that does not mean they stopped fighting.   Unions fought where they could.

The post-70s campaign against the working class was basically bipartisan. Carter and Volcker were the ones to get the ball rolling, Reagan just stepped it up. The Democrats were never a 'labor party' by any stretch and would have in no way challenged the basic post-1979 neoliberal framework (which necessarily involved cutting the working class down a peg) even if they had been elected. The economic policy record of Clinton -> Obama shows pretty clearly how there's unanimous agreement on an extremely pro-business, neoliberal approach between the two parties.    Regarding union concessions: Their other option was to cease existing.   Yawn. This is the standard apologist tripe that's been trotted out in every labor dispute for the last 30 years: ""They made a threat!

Ha ha, zero support? The AFL-CIO's 1981 demonstration had around half a million people show up, still (iirc) one of the biggest protests in US history. There was tremendous support for organized labor at the onset of Reagan's tenure, and it was completely squandered by the unions themselves. The 'open season' came about in large part because the unions made abundantly clear with PATCO that they wouldn't do anything to challenge Reagan's union busting and would roll over the first chance they got.

As it turns out, the economy was already fixing itself with no intervention and no amount of foreign competition could have put a dent in the value of the US economy.  The actual value of the economy... was in the purchasing power of the people. The WAGES were the golden goose, not some temporary systemic advantage. Little known today, but the positive effect of unions supporting broadly shared prosperity resulted in a Kennedy proposal to end the cold war. He felt that 'free trade' could defeat communism--and central to his idea of free trade agreements was that we should require our new partners to start unions because it was such a clear introduction to a middle class economy.

Maybe it's because even the poorest in America can eat, get clean water, breath clean air, and find ways to scrape together money. That they can rest assured they'll get treated if they stumble into the emergency room, whether they can afford it or not. That they have guaranteed free education until they are 18, the right to vote, and don't have any obligation to serve in the military.

They're going to give you morphine, tell you to come back when you're dying, and then give you palliative care until you die. And if you go for something like an injury, you'll likely be so deep in debt from it that you won't be able to actually do anything like rent a place, buy a car, etc until you pay it back.   There's always a such thing as a hierarchy of needs. I think I have the right to complain about my treatment in a system that I perceive as unjust. You're right, we've mostly gotten the ""not letting our citizens outright die"" part down pretty well. But we're also the wealthiest nation in the history of the world and we have people who wait until they're on death's doorstep (see above point) and go to the ER because they can't afford a doctor, and even if they could, they will get fired if they take time off work."

Desperately trying to avoid having children I couldn't provide for.  This is why I believe if things do not get better in this next decade for the 20 somethings, despite exhausting all peaceful means. Then violence is the only way to get things back.

I don't think those people are paying attention to how long this has been happening, how bad things are, and how this has screwed a generation not lost, no. We're a generation whose livelihoods and primes were destroyed for profit, a generation whose quality of living stolen and debased, a generation whose parent's cant and wont understand their children and why we are struggling to live up to yesterdecade's economy so badly.   A generation told not crave traditional lifestyles. I want monogamy to work, I want to own a home, I want to have children but I CANT BECAUSE SHIT IS FUCKED. Then the same media who encourages us against traditional lifestyles goes on and tells older generations ""See, they don't want what you had. They are too selfish and lazy, they want everything given to them from the rich while providing no value themselves.""   We're not a generation lost, but a generation REMOVED, forgotten, betrayed, and stolen from. If anyone ever has the gall to ask how people could turn to violence, they haven't truly lived in our shoes. The anger is real, the fear is real, the momentum is building every day as the media pushes further against us, further deluding the impressionable from feeling remorse for us. In fact, there isn't much remorse, the media inspires hate and ridicule towards us. Our reasonable demands are made to sound like we're whiny spoiled brats who want to take from the rich.  We don't want to take from the rich as much as we want a fair cut of the profit we make for them. But the arguments for us and against us on the mass media are posed through network advertiser's corporate lenses. They distort our issues and never report on how life is like living in our shoes. When they do, they report it as if it's not as profound and prevalent as it truly really is. They will avoid discussing how many people dropped out of labor altogether in order to report how great the unemployment rate is doing. Further deluding the masses. They will avoid how we're living on inflated currency with the real threat of the bubble bursting to report that everything is doing swell!  Shit will hit the fan in our life times. It's coming. The more we remove ourselves from our things, including your phone, computer, tv, air conditioning, etc. the better. We wont always have these things in the decades to come. Don't support politicians who support removing our second amendment rights to own firearms, because we're all going to need them.  I wont turn to violence, but I will fight the long battle. I will have children, raise them with what I know. Teach them to live off the land. Teach them what I have learned from the internet and our media-fueled culture at large.

They would probably support our sterilization if they could get away with it.  We would all be smart to have as many children as we can afford.

I don't need the electronics, the material bullshit, keeping up with my neighbors, etc.. I will move my funds around so that children are my main priority. This economic condition is only temporary, my children will have the opportunity to experience what I couldn't, I want them to not feel like they have to live beyond their means. To buy things that tie them down. I want them to experience life themselves and know that it was because of me that they are here with me. I am the one who experienced the regression, not them. Times are getting so bad that by the time they are of age they will have no where else but up.  Also think it would be amazing to breed a child with my girlfriend. We've been living together like a married couple for 9 years and are set to marry next year on our 10 year anniversary. It would be adorable to see how our child takes after us. I never thought I would get this way, either. But I'm starting to notice things I've never noticed before in the opposite sex. The main thing that gets me off is the thought of impregnating.

Do you feel those people in poor countries should suffer so that the people who happen to live in your geographic area can prosper? What you call ""devastating"" is the sound of millions around the world getting a shot at the quality of life you already have enjoyed.  If protectionist policies were to be enacted, would you then complain about the rise in prices?  Countries are just lines on a piece of paper. Empathy for fellow humans transcends borders."
lostgeneration,3dmkyj,SockGnome,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:33:23 2015 UTC,"Let's take China for example.  You claim that a country is just a line on a piece of paper, but I argue that humans solve real problems using constructs that do not physically exist, like money or international borders. Therefore, by their sheer necessity they ""exist"" whether we like it or not.  That being said, I can take the position that China is the way it is because China's leadership is incompetent, and that it's not my problem. They are not lacking natural resources. They are not suffering from a food shortage. They suffer from the need of enlightenment-era thinking that propelled the West to the status it enjoys today. So one one hand, I believe that I should have a right to object to my nation's wealth being exported to another country that destroys the environment and cares very little for human rights. It's not like I don't care about the Chinese people. I simply care about my own nation's security and long-term stability more.  On the other hand, I feel like free trade agreements that allow capital to move across borders, but not the labor, is unfairly biased toward the owners and producers, and not in the favor of those doing the work. I see no reason there should be laws that both favor the wealthy tightening their grip over the ordinary people and allowing the industrial exploitation of poverty.  And, you're asking me if I'm willing to pay higher prices? That's a complex question, because the very markets affected would change drastically. But yes, I'm willing to pay higher prices in general. And most people would accept it; they'd bitch about their iPhone costing $100 more for about 15 seconds and then move on with their lives. I mean, when I see someone paying $600,000 for a 1000 sq foot house or crowds of people lining up to pay $13 for a tallboy of Bud Lite at a concert, I really have no way of knowing how people would react to higher prices; they spend money very stupidly as it is. Would basic costs of living go up? Are we importing things like houses, food, internet connections? No. The entire argument for globalization centers around ""we want our cheap electronics from China, damn it!"""

Most tech giants employ between 5-30k people (Facebook employs 10k), while most industrial giants from a generation ago (e.g. GM, GE and Ford) would employ 100,000s of people.  The only recently founded company which employs 100,000s of people is Walmart.   Tech companies do not make physical widgets and therefore lack the vast economies of scale which led industrial giants to employ so many people.    Also keep in mind that people of all skill levels, such as businessmen and engineers but also unionized factory workers and assemblymen, worked in industrial corporations, while most of the people who work in tech are highly-educated CS types.  So not only do tech giants create fewer jobs than they destroy, but most of the jobs they create are not accessible to the average American."

lostgeneration,3dpr1j,lackofcoherence,3,Mon Jul 20 04:47:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe for Apple, which actually does produce widgets.  But I don't think that Facebook has armies of low-wage workers in China numbering in the 100k-200k range.  Most leading tech companies don't need manufacturing because they make software, which obviates the need for armies of low-skilled laborers.  There are a few companies which produce hardware (Apple, other cell phone/computer companies), but you can run multiple pieces of software on one piece of hardware, so you don't consume as many low-wage labor hours to satisfy the needs met by these companies as you would if they were each old-school industrial companies which had their own individual labor armies.  If Facebook were like like Kodak and had to produce a tangible widget that you had to buy to somehow satisfy the social networking need which it meets, then Facebook would have its own Kodak-like factory employing 100k people to make this widget.  The same would go for, say, ""industrial Google"" (which might make some super-detailed reference encyclopedia or super-almanac, which obviously sucks compared to real Google.).  If I buy the physical Facebook widget and the physical Google widget then I've just paid for the labor hours from two different (and massive) armies of low-skilled laborers and made their jobs necessary.  Hooray, low-skilled people will have well-paying jobs!  This is basically 1950's-1980's industrial age America.  But if Facebook and Google sell digital products which can be run on a single physical widget, then I just buy the single physical widget (computer, in laptop or phone form) and use Facebook and Google on it, meaning that I've only paid for the services of only one single industrial army (cough Foxconn) which made the device I use to Facebook and Google.  Now say that I can use Facebook, Google, Amazon, Instagram, Whatsapp, Youtube (which replaces the music industry) and god knows what else on this single device.  I'm still only using one or two labor armies to utilize the services of all of these companies, meaning that fewer manufacturing jobs will be needed.    So even if tech companies do require manufacturing labor in some form, they will not require as much as their industrial predecessors did, meaning that we will still have fewer well paying jobs for average people.  Edit: Another way to think about this is to imagine an old industrial corporation as a corpora, or a body.  It had a business head, perhaps arms and a chest (research, engineering etc...) and then the torso and legs (the manufacturing base).    Tech companies which share the same manufacturing base are like a hydra, with multiple heads utilizing the same torso and legs (cough Foxconn).  The heads are well-paid and in the United States, but don't need much labor.  The labor that they do need is well-remunerated brain labor.  The body is huge, needs cheap labor and is in China.  But if you required each hydra head to have its own body, as its ancestors did, then the combined mass of their torsos and legs would be greater than the singular mass of the hydra's giant torso and legs."

Minimum wage needs to be living wage.  More importantly, businesses need to train and invest in entry level workers. Any halfway decent job that doesn't require a degree (and at least half of those that do) demand at least 3 years of work experience doing the same job somewhere else. Businesses aren't willing to foot the bill, they'd rather let positions sit unfilled for months than hire somebody they need to pay to train and can't be 100% productive from day 1.

Hedge funds began repackaging risky trophy stocks (misspelled names, trophies with bowling figurines on top and the infamous 'congrats on your rehab' design, to name a few) into subprime bundles.   The house of cards collapsed in August 1998, when one young intern at Bear Stearns received a trophy for an admittedly mediocre quarterly report. Quickly, he realized that trophies were highly overvalued. Immediately the youngster sold all his trophy stock and bought a yacht, setting off a frenzied panic as investors followed suit.   When the resulting mayhem subsided and the dust settled, we entered on the Great Trophy Recession. Unemployment shot to 15% as Americans formerly employed in the lucrative trophy assembly and engraving industries languished. Little league teams across the nation were forced to accept defeat with no participation trophies, forever damaging their tender psyches and senses of self-worth when the resulting economic collapse was blamed on their receiving stupid plastic trophies they didn't care about in the first place.

So little imagination is given to the intermediate steps. In the US, we effectively outlaw economic non-participation (homelessness) with geographic exclusion via sit-lay laws... and this guy expects those same owners will just voluntarily allow an alternate to their ownership of everything? The enforcement of exclusion now comes with violence including death. Does no one else see that the US is now experimenting with extermination? The excluded can, in some cases, be punished summarily for simple existence in a geography where they have not paid. And the punishment is death--dispensed at the time of infraction--via everyday citizens that we just call the cops.   I believe it offers an escape route – but only if these micro-level projects are nurtured, promoted and protected by a fundamental change in what governments do.

My grandfather's high school science notebook from 1907 (I'm old, and he and my mother had children later in life) is more advanced than any undergraduate course today.  One of the purposes of schools was to keep youth out of the work force. ""Truancy"" laws were enacted, and that age kept being raised, to where 18 is now not uncommon. The dumbing down of high school and new requirement of college as a minimum requirement to enter the work force is a further extension.  The Great Recession and associated permanent studenthood (graduate degrees, post-docs) was yet another extension. People just stayed in school because there were no jobs. The difference of course is that college on up are not tuition-free.  We keep fearing coming technological unemployment, but it's been with us since the Civil War, pushing up the age of family formation every year.

It's tone is not academic at all and is instead an opinion piece by the authors designed to look like academic research.  Some of the glaring flaws of their paper are ""single use"" stadiums, and then invoking Key Arena.  Amazingly since the Sonics left, Key Arena survives. In fact, in 2 weeks it's hosting The International, which is a Dota championship with people coming in from all over the world to attend. I know. I'm sending my son there from Montreal.  The argument against sports stadiums makes a ton of sense for NFL stadiums, which are worthless white whales, followed by MLB stadiums. MLB stadiums at least get a pass since they are used a minimum of 81 times per year. NFL stadiums are used as little as 8.   NBA/NHL arenas are not part of that logic, especially if you host both sports. If you host only one, you still get a minimum of 41 games of use. If you host both sports, you get 82.  I have been to plenty of concerts at these multi-use arenas. Trade shows as well.   You cannot write an article with ""single use"" as your boogeyman and then fucking try and dupe us with some bait-and-switch bullshit. This is dishonest, biased writing disguised as actual academic research and stinks as bad as the ""there's no climate change"" and ""fracking is safe"" bullshit commissioned by corporate oil.

Your link also only takes into account those who actually GOT jobs post graduation. I'm talking about the condition of a demographic as a whole and you're talking about a very specific subset of that demographic.  So, let's break this down, of the total generation between the current ages of 18 and 34, only about 1% make better than roughly $100k a year, including graduates. Only about 15% make better than $45k a year. Of college graduates, half of them make more than $45k a year, and half of them make less (it's a median), of the ones who find employment post graduation. This is not accounting for the likely drag on incomes from student loans for college graduates.  Contrasted with the cost of living, not to mention the typical inflation adjusted pay and buying power at the same ages for previous generations, I can say with confidence that yes, the overwhelming majority of millenials do not earn an income that allows for independant living, meaningful savings, or investment in the future. While it may not be abject poverty, it's unquestionably poor, and a serious downgrade from the standard of living of the last two generations.

Both have a bathroom, a kitchen, heating and cooling, and more importantly it's the human being that produces that waste, not the space.  However, cramming a building full of that many people with that little space merely condenses the waste produced and power consumed. Which the overall infrastructure was never designed to accomodate. I did a long blurb on this in one of my previous posts, but the cliffs notes version is that the sewer cannot handle that kind of output from a single building. It causes backups. Mold becomes an issue, and a health hazard, and any kind of water damage becomes nearly impossible to fix because the utilites are packed in so tightly. You have to disassemble 8 units to track down and fix a leaky pipe. In addition, every fire chief that has looked at the places says that they're death traps. The number of people that are in them simply could not evacuate in time.  It's simply not healthy or feasable to cram that many people into that small a space. And yet, they're doing it.

lostgeneration,3dgmix,opiusmaximus,28,Thu Jul 16 02:55:43 2015 UTC,"Place it where it really belongs.   The guy who delivered to the wrong address, or The asshole who signed for the package and stole it, or The dipshit who printed a label with the wrong address, or The system designers who designed the faulty system that allows UPS drivers to drop off a package at the wrong location.  It's someones fault and just because they aren't a 1%er doesn't mean they can't take the blame. But both UPS and most companies that ship know this happens all the time so if you complain about it you will probably be made whole again. That's why I try to only order from big sites like Amazon where I can be 100% confident that if anything whatsoever fucks up before I get what I paid for, they will fix it."

They're so advanced they've sold it to other companies as a product. Companies aspire to reach the engineering superiority that ups has gained over the years. There's a reason why there are only three major parcel carriers.  Remember when DHL tried to compete and said ""fuck this"" after two or three years? Yeah, that's what happened.   The other stuff... Sounds about right (excluding the under paid part, bc ups drivers aren't underpaid)"

You have a lack of affordable housing stock, combined with a class of consumer that simply doesn't care about cost.  That's why gentrification happens so fast.  And its crippling newcomers.  Eventually, it has to turn around, but as long as there is a highly educated class of worker who doesn't care about income or outlay (why should they?  Salary goes to pure discretionary purposes not housing) you are competing in an uneven playing field, that will run out of the city the people who make it work.  I remember articles where restaurants can't find kitchen staff to work at the wages they are prepared to pay.  Many more jobs like this will either force low margin businesses to go out of business.  Middle class professionals will find it harder and harder to justify the cost of living and working in NYC.  I'd rather work for 75k in NJ, where parking is free and lunch costs less then $10, then for $100k in NYC.  I'd take home more cash.

A woman needs safety for herself and her child and a man needs a way to spread his seed.    This is why women like strong, healthy, motivated men and why men like women with big tits and big asses.    It's always been a transaction.

People watch cartoons, shows, movies, read books, etc., in which the protagonist goes through all the most exciting parts of life, with everything perfectly scripted to be optimised for drama, humor, love, and satisfaction.    What they don't see is the day to day uninteresting grind of those characters' lives.    In real life, action is rare, the perfect ending never happens, people don't make perfectly set up jokes every 3 minutes, appropriately tailored music doesn't start playing out of nowhere, and anything worth doing takes a lot of sitting alone and thinking."

lostgeneration,3deoes,bejammin075,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:01:22 2015 UTC,"I heard him say that in a speech, probably the one he gave in Madison, WI. The way he delivered it was almost hushed, as though he wasn't wild about saying it, maybe not because he didn't believe in it, but because he was unsure how ""helping debtors"" would play politically. Whatever. Bunch of speculation on my part.  Anyway, the substance sounds great. Allowing people to refinance at a much lower interest rate would be a huge relief for a lot of people. Heck, I have several federal grad PLUS loans that are at 7.9%. Getting that down even to 3% would be amazing. Since you can already refinance your federal student loans with a private lender, I have to assume that he meant people should be able to refinance their loans with the Dept. of Education. Crucially, this means that people currently making payments under income-driven payment plans would not lose the protections offered under those plans simply by refinancing. It also might mean (gasp) that people beholden to private lenders could refinance with the Dept. of Education and swap their creditors for one that's much easier to work with.  I hope he'll go further, but this is a politically touchy issue so this might be all we hear from him for a while. He could probably propose allowing everyone into income-driven plans and offering real, non-taxable forgiveness at the end of a long term of on-time minimum payments without taking any political hit at all. Other countries with student loan systems do this, and it seems like one of the ways out of this mess that would be the smallest hit on the government's books.

People don't realize, within just 5-10 years, the people w/ debt vs w/o debt are in a VERY different place. People w/o have decent equity in a home, and their life is more comfortable and secure than someone who is paying a lot to debt and living in an apartment.  It's kinda funny, people would tell me, ""you'd be doing great if you weren't wasting money!"" forgetting that in just a few years, I'd paid enough in student loan payments to have put down a deposit on a house.

There are many great options. A wonderful first step is to seek out knowledge on one's own, to become an autodidactic learner. A great first place to start is with one's own diet and health. You control your own body, so why poison it with things like alcohol or unhealthy food?

Money is pieces of paper we agreed are worth x amount of food. It shouldn't be worth dying for. People have marvelous, creative, capable minds, and because our machines aren't progressing as fast as we want, we are building human minds in the likeness of machines to fill niches that are increasingly more robotic, even though human minds are good at different things than robots.

I like to imagine that base pay would become a livable salary, because if someone got a second job the first company would still have to pay overtime, and they'd get worse production from overworked employees. But knowing how companies operate, a better estimate might be limiting OT pay by limiting employees to 4 hours per week, forcing them to juggle 10 jobs with no set schedule."

I still remember when I was 10; right after 9/11, the news in Kansas was reporting that gas prices may rise over $5 a gallon.  I still remember seeing how worried my mom was; looking back she was likely worried that she might not be able to afford to drive to work anymore.  She started driving more conservatively, as did the rest of my family, because they were suddenly getting half the gas for what they were used to paying for.  Even if that is not the collective normal experience, as a generation of predominantly minimum-wage workers, gas is still a major factor in our collective decision regarding driving.  If you factor in a car from the early 90's that gets maybe 20mpg, that means each hour you work you will be able to drive 54 miles ($3 per gallon/20 miles per gallon = $.15 per mile. $8.15*/$.15=54 miles/ hours worked) if the engine were to operate at it's optimal efficiency for the duration of it's operation, which it won't.  Factor in a few bills and some savings for incidentals, and soon enough you simply don't have the ability to drive very far.  *Based off of the minimum wage in my state.  YMMV (pun intended!)

If I ever do get around to it, I'm just going to rebuild it as an electric vehicle - it doesn't make sense to me to keep it as-is, between CA's emissions standards requiring the equipment to be kept stock (removing the possibility of making it more efficient) and the cost of fuel.  Yes, it can be fun to take a sports car on a run through a windy canyon road - but that's not what a daily commute usually is.

Pretty much if you're not a) a gov't bureaucrat or b) part of a labor union, your employer won't be offering a DB plan.  The main difference between DB and DC plans is that with DB, the risk is on the employer. With DC, the risk is on the employee. Employers don't want to take the risk anymore (it's also not like they need to compete for workers anymore! Ha!). Here's a list of some major companies who are freezing or terminating their plans.  It seems as if state pension actuaries have done a poor job of managing risk here. They need to decrease future benefit accruals immediately before everyone is left in the dust. You certainly can't rely on the stock market casino to catch it back up. Corporate greed, bad economy and poor actuarial practices are all to blame to some extent for this exodus.  I'm actually kinda glad I got canned from my pensions job. It's a dying field, and I know I wouldn't have a career left by the time I hit 50.

If they do fire me for that, (which honestly, I think they are too smart to do that - they'll find a more ""acceptable"" reason to fire me), I'll get OSHA involved and a lawyer. No matter what, OSHA is going to be contacted in the end. Also, they won't give me a lunch break when I'm entitled to one either on the weekends. If I work 6.0+ hours, I'm entitled to a half hour lunch according to company employee handbook - doesn't matter what day of the week it is. They have outright refused to give me a lunch when I have a 6hr+ shift on the weekend. (they're also stupid enough to have done it over email. I have written proof.) It's bad enough that they don't even give 15 minutes breaks either, but I have ""admin time"" which means I still have to work during that time, but I don't have to deal with customers and it's only one 10 minute period for the whole damn day. I have to wait 6+ hours before I can have a meal/snack and they like to schedule me during the late morning and through the afternoon everyday.

Basically I have to answer to people now that neither understand what I exactly do (which was the same when I was a nuclear operator), only now I make more money then my supervisors (due to overtime, travel, giving up holidays).   I think my managers would replace me in a heartbeat if they could. At the same time, I can barely resist the urge not to throw a punch whenever I am in the home office for more than a week.   Makes for a fun office."
lostgeneration,3ddtat,14inthehand,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:02:50 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much exactly why I am looking at insubordination. The workforce (including the military) is starting to become as educated as the leadership.  Obviously, it is a slow transition, but the number of NCOs finishing graduate degrees is staggering. Its not just that workers know more about their task or specialty, but they are starting to become much more knowledgeable about big picture issues as well.  To me, this is the root cause of either a) insubordination or b) managers' perceptions that employees are being insubordinate.  Really, thanks for sharing this - super helpful."
lostgeneration,3ddtat,14inthehand,2,Thu Jul 16 14:50:32 2015 UTC,"I think the big issue, and this a frustration on my part, is that most of my managers, even if they did my job in the past, don't recognize the complexity of how our industry has change.   I install and commission drives in the field. Even my supervisors who used to do this, don't have a full conceptual understanding of what I have to do.   For example, 10 years ago, basically there was two types of drives we sold...AC and DC along with the products just going into steel mills. I'm now expected to be able to handle a product line of close to 30 different types of AC drives along with DC drives that include Cyclo-converters, digital front ends, and all kinds of weird shit. I also have to do PLC work, data base trouble shooting. These go into oil fields, steel mills, paper mills, port cranes, mine equipment. I'm also expected to be able to install large (like 30 tons and heavier) motors and commission them. I literally have no clue where I sleep from one week to the next nor what I will be working on.   So all the time, I get an assignment with insane expectations because my management has no clue what they are even talking about. I've just been told I got two days to go up to a site where our third party supplier has fucked up a cooling water system on a drive. They told the customer I could fix it in a day, not realizing I have to completely drain the cooling water system, fix the leaking components (which includes onsite machining), fill the system again, change out an ion exchanger as I am going to burn out the one currently in the system, flush it for 24 hours, start up the drive, and monitor it for 48 hours.   Oh and this is on a 13.8KV drive system I have never touched before.   I have literally spent the entire morning walking around from cubical to cubical with drawings and documents trying to convince these people to give the customer a realistic impression of how long their compressor is going to be down. But most likely I will show up, the customer will get pissed when I can't make magic happen, and then my management will get pissed when they figure out it was way more expensive then they expected.   But fuck it... I get paid by the hour."

Honestly though, if the US were to force tariffs on the rest of the world, that would be HILARIOUS.

In order to get a home you have several hurdles to clear, which are particularly difficult for millennials, here are the big three:   Credit score. You need a good credit score, which is pretty hard if you're still paying off crippling college debt, or a car, or credit card debt. You have a bad score? Fuck right off. Down payment. This one isn't so bad with FHA and USDA loans available but still it's less likely to be some poor millenial ponying up the cash even if they have the down payment. Why? Well lets say they have 3.5% down for FHA, (USDA tends to be places where there is no work, it's only certain geographic regions) that means they now need to factor in a higher priced PMI (private mortgage insurance) into their monthly cost, limiting how much house they can buy. Income requirement. Let's say everything else is in order, you have good credit, a decent down-payment (not likely to be 20% to 30% like it was for the boomers, yes that was actually not unusual for them) but let's say 3.5% to 10%. You can still get fucked if you're hourly, because your income is variable, the bank doesn't have as much faith in you. You'll probably need 6 months minimum working this job to qualify, maybe even a year if it's a new industry for you. Hopefully you're not job hopping. Maybe you clock a lot of overtime, might not count that because it isn't seen as ""regular."" Hoping to get by on a second income? They may not let you use it because they don't want people quitting their second job once they get the loan, but at least 6 months there as well to qualify, maybe more. If you're salaried they'll tongue your asshole, you just have to make enough to cover the interest + PMI + HOA + property taxes, all of which will factor into your application.   If you're deficient in any of these areas you'll get either a drastically lower mortgage or not approved at all. Good luck then."

I have seen people work hard & faithfully for years under the very real threat of downsizing and layoffs. One restaurant that I know with some pretty loyal workers had been trying to sell and go out of business since 2007. Imagine reporting to work day in/day out, week in/ week out knowing that your job is desperately trying to be sold.  Thats what the skill of work is, to, for years, daily face the chopping block and the end of your livelihood. You know the (insert business here) is not doing the numbers but go to work anyway.  Its tricky and even if we did learn the ""skills"" to be workers, there are less jobs from year to year.

If we just want workers to be good learners, I think we do a pretty damn good job of that, speaking as a high school teacher.

They'll repatriate, or won't take as many educational or entrepreneurial risks, or look for ways to passively protest (consuming less, homesteading, bartering, sharing equipment through tool libraries and labor through co-ops) in an attempt to find ways to slowly divorce themselves from or reject the current market system.  Or, failing passive protest, if our society makes those things impossible (or they provide too little opportunity for sustainable living, too late) members of the non-financial elite will eventually be forced into actively, probably violent, political protesting.     Many economists, particularly conservatives, warn that restricting trade and adding new regulations to the labor market would crimp economic efficiency and slow growth.  Sanders rejects that argument. “By efficiency, many conservative economists mean, ‘the best way for large corporations to make excessive profits,’” he said, adding: “They’re efficient for the people who own the corporations. They’re not particularly efficient for the people who have been thrown out on the street.”   Wow.  Completely destroyed.

However, I will take issue with his statement here.   Massive growth can be achieved when the masses have access to capital. Being able to pay your bills helps the economy in a much more substantial way than flinging money at the latest startup. Ensuring that the ""bottom"" of an economy has enough cash will not only keep it afloat, but will push it towards a strength that hasn't been seen in this country for several decades.   Funding a basic income is an argument about details. What I want you to imagine is a huge influx of cash directly at the bottom. It can only go up, and I'll guarantee that 100% of that money will end up in the pockets of the rich. But while it is getting there, it'll help feed, clothe, educate, and generally support the poor, the middle class, and absolutely the wealthy. And each transaction grows the economy, making it stronger.   Growth to only a specific subset leads to cancers. Growth distributed across an entire organism leads to health. This holds true for any system, organic or economic.   Mr. Sanders isn't wrong with what he said, but his lack of a solution is problematic to me. A basic income helps solve many of these issues without threatening the sacred goat that is ""growth."""

Children are a net resource in primarily less advanced economies. So for example, if you are a farmer, a large family is good because you are creating a free workforce. Education in the third world is cheaper.   Now in the first world, children become a net cost over time. Instead of a child leaving home at 14 to work, its around 19+ years of age. Instead of just getting a few years of education, it requires over a decade to be able to successfully function in a modern society.   We also see a population drop with the increase of women's rights. Their role in our society is not to just pump out babies until they die.

Once specific indicators have been reached within the allotted time period, the investors receive a return on investment. But if the project fails, the investors receive no return on investment. Look into Third Sector Capital Partners. They are changing charity for the better."

He is not playing the political game in a way I am used to, which is refreshing.

As for my negativity, I reserve it for areas of my life experience in which my optimism, positivity, generosity, etc... amounted to jack shit, fell on deaf ears, landed on infertile ground, etc.... If I viewed the ghettoized STEM world and its crabby and artless hordes of neoliberal dipshits and braindead worker drones with any more generosity, I'd be guilty of an idealism on par with radical religious belief.  To be honest, everything else in my life is pretty awesome. The fact that I've had a tough go at finding work doesn't make feel a shred of shame.

How great would it be if the you could only use those funds to pay for credits up to $300 each. That would encourage schools to keep the cost down.
lostgeneration,3cz2et,ThirdPlaceLithium,0,Sun Jul 12 12:44:27 2015 UTC,"This would be a great move.  Restricting federal grants to public universities only would make them more competitive to get into and shut out a lot of middle achievers.

lostgeneration,3cz2et,GNU_RIDA,-1,Sun Jul 12 13:11:07 2015 UTC,"A higher education is a privilege, not a right. Children already receive ""free"" K-12 education, which people already bitch about (quality wise).  No child left behind sets a lot of public school kids up for failure because public schools are usually a mix of various socioeconomic classes.  And at the end of the day, a child who comes from a low income home can be studious while at school, but when they go home their parents don't have the time to reinforce what's been taught in school.  And then our public schooling system also has to cater to anchor babies/illegal immigrants. While Americans scream racism, the European countries with ""free"" college have strict immigration laws as well. So their K-12 schools aren't infiltrated with less intelligent folks"

In the state school the quality was much lower, and we were mostly taught by TAs as opposed to ph.ds at the private. The paperwork and tuition system was a beaurocratic nightmare. There was still less accountability and oversight-I knew more than one kid who couldn't get into their degree program because someone in the office lost the paperwork.     All getting rid of the current system in order to free up tuition will do is force poor kids to go to the lower quality state schools while the upper class still gets to enjoy the private schools. It's unfair to lower class kids and takes away their options.     But durrrr, I must be totally uneducated since I think that. Why don't you explain the link between holding my opinion and one's education level?"

Obamacare does nothing to address the problem of insurance companies pillaging the country for their own profit — except for getting rid of screening for pre-existing conditions. It remains to be seen whether the mandate has actually lowered costs. Hospitals are still charging a bajillion dollars for an aspirin.  Fuck all this convoluted, unfair garbage.

That's me. No job = no income = no healthcare coverage. I used to have health insurance as a grad student working for a public university. I couldn't even afford to use it because of the $200 deductible... on top of the cost just to get the insurance... plus any expenses that potentially wouldn't be covered entirely by insurance. Nooooo thank you. I'd rather keep what little money I have.  Also, I filed my taxes myself this year. Although I did have health insurance for all of 2014, nowhere in the program did it ask me to verify this information. I wonder how many people got out of paying the fine for not having insurance."

Since the original group of Republicans LIED about the compromise and no Republicans voted for it, there's little reason for this half crappy version. Medicare for all would be better--and fancy people can pay for supplemental insurance or pay-for-service if they want other care.

lostgeneration,3cxnwm,Eudaimonics,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:26:05 2015 UTC,"If your employer offers a plan, even if its totally shit, you don't qualify for a tax credit on the market plans. Let that sink in.  Actually, while I'm at it, fuck obamacare and here's why. Let's say you get the tax credit, you don't actually receive it until you file your taxes and get mailed the credit, so if you make no money to begin with you have to somehow cover the cost of your premiums plus deductibles/copay for the rest of the year. Lets say you can do that, you can easily pay 2500 in premiums, and up to $6000 in deductibles/copay in one year, which for the average worker is most their income. A lot of people would still be bankrupted by such a setup (you can pay even more for family, $12,000 IIRC). A bargain rate plan only covers regular check ups, which is little more than your premium anyway, and major medical. Which means if you do anything else including just basic lab tests you pay out of pocket, on top of premiums and any potential deductibles. The penalty for not having insurance is way less than you get fucked in buying the cheapest plans. It's a completely shit system."
lostgeneration,3cxnwm,louieanderson,11,Sat Jul 11 21:34:25 2015 UTC,"Except everything you said is basically wrong. If your employer's plan is unaffordable (costs more than 8%* of your income) you do qualify for a credit or if your employer's plan does not meet the new requirements on minimum essential benefits and minimum standard value.   For people with incomes that are 134-250% of the FPL you get a pretty nice cost sharing subsidy on the silver plan where the government pays the difference in deductible and out of pocket max for you to make it more affordable. Here is the typical savings matrix:   http://i.imgur.com/h2jrBO0.png  Additionally states can capture that cost share subsidy and use it to create a Basic Health Plan. Minnesota has done this so people there can basically sign up for a means tested single payer plan for people who make too much for medicaid but less than 250% of FPL.   The new philosophy on health insurance is that it shouldn't be something used for routine medical expenses and should not so ""generous"" as to encourage overuse of medical resources. Buying a higher amount of rental coverage doesn't increase the incidence of break ins to your apartment. Having a health insurance plan that essentially works as a prepaid medical care service does increase medical costs and inflation.   *thanks for the correction banjo"

Unless you live in a Republican state that refuse to implement the Affordable Healthcare Act.  The Advance Premium Tax Credit only applies if you earn too much money to qualify for medicaid and it is a credit that you are given immediately by a government payment to the insurance company to lower your monthly premium.  What happens at the end of the  year is that you are reconciling the credit you took out early with your actual earnings. The governement doesn't know if you had a lottery win or some sort of additional form of revenue, or if you lost your job and were entitled to a bigger credit so you have to reconcile what you actually earned and pay back money if you were given too large a credit or get an additional credit if you didn't take enough out."

How can I empower the citizens to take control of their community at the base grassroots level, not enter into the houses of Parliament, the Bundestag or the American Congress (as though you have a fat chance of doing it anyway and thank God we don't) [and] not to develop the bad habits of parliamentarism, but to try to create neighborhood assemblies such as we have in Burlington - town meeting type forms - councils in neighborhoods-confederate them, and confederate the communities into a dual power against the centralized state on the basis of libertarian tradition?    by libertarian he means the original use of the word which is libertarian-socialist. Not the tea-party or American appropriation of the word.   As long as you can speak freely, populism that can't win through the dissemination of ideas isn't going to suddenly become more popular when you start shooting people, and oppression isn't going to be defeated by using violence to oppress anybody who does not acquiesce to your demands.   There is no oppressing and oppressor. I don't understand that logic. If black slaves rose up in rebellion is that oppressing an oppressor? It's called justice and your statement sounds like it's an excuse for injustice.  And lastly, why do you even mention violent revolution in regards to this article?"

Reread that sentence, based on your reply you either misunderstood or or chose to intentionally misinterpret it.   If black slaves rose up in rebellion is that oppressing an oppressor?   You're arguing against a straw man. I'm talking about forcing 'revolutionary socialism' on the country as a whole, by the barrel of a gun. I can sympathize with the desire to destroy the system that allows for these blatant abuses, and I agree that a socialist society would address some of these problems, but those also inevitably comes with their own fires that will need to be put out. How many more elderly starve when the economy implodes in the transition? How many more are made homeless? How many more are slaughtered?  It seems far more effective, if we're talking about the United States, to take the people involved in that same revolutionary movement and help them relocate to a small New England state over the span of a decade and make sure they are all registered to vote. Vermont has several voting districts under 7,000 people, and the whole state only has 185,000 voters - it wouldn't take that many socialists (a fraction of the number it would take to stage a successful revolution, at least) to create an unbeatable voting bloc.  I think as long as bloodless channels remain remotely viable, violence should be avoided. If you have enough people to successfully win through combat, you have enough people to win through elections.   And lastly, why do you even mention violent revolution in regards to this article?   Because in the past you've explicitly explained that socialism is exclusively defined as revolutionary, and, therefore, anything that is not revolutionary cannot truly be socialism. I think that's a very narrow view of what socialism is and can be - one borne out of Marx's own time and context that is not universally applicable.  As long as you can speak freely, populism that can't win through the dissemination of ideas isn't going to suddenly become more popular when you start shooting people, and oppression isn't going to be defeated by using violence to oppress anybody who does not acquiesce to your demands. The idea that violent revolutionaries who risked death to come into power are then going to peacefully cede that power to the proletariat once they've finally conquered their shared bourgeoisie enemies is the illusion that revolutionaries have fallen for again and again."

This is where the liberals of reddit loose me. They seem to think that capitalism has existed since time began. Capitalism came to be due to a certain set of circumstances in the world. More specifically in the English countryside in the 16th century. It was born out of imperatives of increased labor production, the need to maximize profits and more. Eventually common property that wasn't used to be ""improved""  was taken and held in private hands because it was a ""waste"" to not create value off the land. And thus the history of capitalism began. Coincidentally it was also used as a justification for taking lands away from our forgotten friends, Native Americans.   Capitalism began at a point in time. Prior to it and also during its beginnings a system existed called Feudalism. It too had a beginning and end. To say that there's not a possibility for something beyond capitalism is ignoring those changes in history. Will it happen before we totally fuck the planet? Tough to say, but I hope.  Most people who argue against Socialism talk about it in terms of fedual forms of extra-economic power (force) to achieve it's ends. That the poor citizens who just want their exploitative-capitalism would be lined up and shot yet their is no basis for this. No one knows the outcome of a future that hasn't been written. In this highly hypothetical situation it's pointless to say who's on what side and who will do it what. So if Socialist ""oppress"" everyday people who aren't for it, what are the capitalist forces going to be doing? Killing all the everyday people who want it? It's hilarious how we can point out all the problems of this system but when it comes down to challenging it we make excuses for the problems that go on and even try to justify them by villianizing anyone who dares critique and challenge it. We then swiftly ignore all the violence that has taken place in the name of profit. Suffering and misery melts into air as soon as uncertainty of a future unknown comes about and then we open our eyes and we're right back where we started.  FYI I've also never defined what the outcomes of the future would be if people actually attained some class consciousness. I'd prefer direct democracy where people have a direct say in the decisions that affect their lives. I do prefer economic democracy where the property relations that define capitalism are challenged and people have again, people have a direct say in the decisions that affect their lives. I do think Representative democracy presents meager possibilities especially in an age where a common stereotype of a politician a liar motivated only by money. And that is more or less true. I think power should come from below and anyone who threatens society with anti-social behavior and policy should be recalled immediately from their purely administrative position.    There's a lot of smart people with a lot of good ideas who want to make the best world they can conceive of, and to dismiss those because they don't adhere to the entirety of a specific -ism seems like a level of religious devotion that makes little sense to me.   There's also a lot of smart people with good ideas who happen to advocate for a society with democracy in the workplace.Yet social democrats to the far right dismiss socialists as ""crazy"", ""insane"". There is no debate. Touching the holy grail of profit makes you an enemy.  I'd argue we don't have 10-20-30-40 years to hope people will  vote in a representative democracy. We are fucking the planet and the profit motive will continue on its normal trajectory until change happens or worse, we make the planet inhospitable."

No, it's still somewhere up there, but they're hoping that they can get it down to $11.

The audit amendment would've included the Fed's discount window, its funding facilities, its open market operations, and its agreements with foreign bankers, which are currently not audited, nor is that information disclosed anywhere.  Also, the idea that the Fed is ""independent"" and not a political tool is a joke because it is a creation of Congress and it's board members are appointed by the President. Transparency isn't going to somehow make it more of a political tool than it already is, but will give the people access to more information when deciding who to vote for.  Besides, you're dodging the point which is that Bernie Sanders is a dishonest liar who does the bidding of the banks.  He says he will break up the banks but based on his past record of lying, he likely will do nothing of the sort."

The reason the Fed operates semi-independently is so they aren't hostage to the political flavor du jour. If Bernanke had done what Ron Paul wanted during the recession, the country would have probably collapsed. That's because politicians don't actually know how to run a central bank and they are more concerned with saying something popular than something actually right.

lostgeneration,3cyltx,JustStopDude,-3,Sun Jul 12 04:18:47 2015 UTC,"That's an unfair characterization. He makes an analogy with slavery - people couldn't fathom the technological advances in farming techniques and thought slavery was the only way to keep up the level of farming production. Similarly unprecedented societal institutions may emerge if there is no longer a state that initiates force. He doesn't expect the largest governments of the world to go away any time soon and takes a generational approach by showing people the benefits of peaceful parenting.    I wish you would directly engage with the arguments people put forward instead of just calling people names and saying you are a ""fucking idiot"" if you disagree."

But since he needs it to make his point and he knows his audience is a collection of people who already agree with him, he can say any amount of moronic shit and his fans lap it up.   Do you know why France and England...along with the rest of Europe was so unwilling to recognize the Confederacy?  The Crimean War had ended. While that was was localized, it had effects, along with problematic weather, of producing food supply interruptions for pretty much all of Europe. England, France, Russia, and the German states were basically dependent on the food supply coming from US northern states. The south only produced cash crops like tobacco and cotton for export. So the notion that slavery was a required for food production is not supported by any reasonable evidence. In fact, it was the northern farms that were not only supporting the US domestic market, but also serving the European markets. No slavery involved.   Furthermore, advancements in farming techniques, specifically Eli Whitney's cotton gin actually INCREASE the usage of slaves as it made cotton production more profitable.   So basically, the reference you mentioned is a perfect example of what Molyneux and a lot of youtube self taught historians/philosophers/etc wannbe experts do. They make what sounds like a reasonable conclusion based on very flawed or completely made up observations.   So yes...he is a fucking idiot."

At first, I was working closely with the people who used the software and I saw first-hand how it helped them.  Later, I started a business building software from what I'd learned.  Work came to me through former co-workers who had moved on to other companies and liked the software I'd built.   All was going well -- until things got even better.  I was approached by someone who wanted me to help roll it all out to a ""very large player"" in the industry (such deep, deep pockets).  This was more than I had previously thought to hope for - a guy (calling me) who was in that middle-management sweet spot where he both knows what he wants and can also get it.  Then...oh, then...l  began to think about what would likely happen if things went well. I had briefly worked for this giant, and in that time I could not help but notice who usually benefited from new initiatives - and who did not.  When I thought about how much easier and faster the work could be done, I realized what would happen.  All those people that used to be down the hall from me when I was helping them out years ago - well, most of them wouldn't have those jobs anymore.  So, I kinda Iet that deal fall apart and it isn't going to go back together again.  It would have been... It could have worked out really well.  I think - maybe I didn't want it that much, because I'm getting old or because I just really want a change.  I don't know.  But I do know that I probably could have signed those contracts, if I hadn't been worried about who might lose their jobs.  I wouldn't have had to make that choice.  This isn't one of the big reasons that we would all benefit from a guaranteed income, but it is one of the reasons - and maybe not one that you hear about very often.  Did I buy any time for anyone?  Probably.  It is niche software and so I don't really have a direct competitor.  It's too bad, though.

All of this is generally done within a general call for libertarian  and voluntary human relationships  through the identification, criticism, and practical dismantling of illegitimate authority in all aspects of human life.

Bah, comes with the territory =)   Socialism is for the freedom of the worker as much as capitalism is for the freedom of those with capital.   While I agree with this point, especially within a historical context, I actually associate socialism less with the freedom of workers but more with the freedom of human beings generally. With increasing automation, I think it will become more and more outdated to define ourselves as ""worker"" or ""capitalist"", but more as just human beings that naturally work when something needs to be done. I don't think work should be made a fetish (not saying that you are doing this), and think that there are innumerable worthwhile human activities that perhaps traditionally don't fit into the standard image of ""work""."

lostgeneration,3csdzb,Euphemism,16,Fri Jul 10 19:49:04 2015 UTC,"He's not wrong. This is an important thing that a lot of our generation worries about, but the fact of the matter is that so far, every crash has been temporary. The idea that the entire market will disappear overnight is kind of a flawed thing to worry about since that means your money is useless whether it was in the market or in your pocket. If the market has failed, the USA is probably gone.   People also don't seem to understand that the price of the market only matters at 2 points: when you buy and when you sell.   Who cares if your portfolio increased 1000% one year if you never capitalized on the gains and it dropped off slowly over the next couple years only betting you 20% when you cashed out.   Conversely, who cares if your portfolio loses 50% of the value overnight if you don't plan on retiring for 50 more years. You still own the same total number of shares regardless of value, and there are 50 years for those same number of shares to appreciate in value, which historically is highly likely.   Most people don't realize you shouldn't buy stocks by the company either. This exposes you to a ton of risk and you can lose all of your money in a company if it folds. Low-fee passively managed mutual funds spread risk the greatest and pretty much guarantee a return that beats inflation over a 10 year period. Something like Vanguards Total Stock Index Fund owns literally every company on the stock market in proportions that are representative of each companies actual share of the overall market. You don't have to worry about picking winners or losers since you own a little bit of everything. It's been shown that no one can constantly beat the market, so instead of gambling, you are just settling on taking the overall market growth."

lostgeneration,3csdzb,JerkJenkins,4,Fri Jul 10 12:55:52 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the assessment that we will always be risk averse. The depression era led to people keeping their fortunes hidden inside picture frames and seen in mattresses. I don't know too many people who actually advocate on that. When you are investing for the long haul your best bet is having a good savings rate and a reliable long term return in tax sheltered accounts. Get your annual $5,500 in your IRA and $18,000 in your 401k and then you can start worrying about high risk investing.   The effect of increasing your annual savings by 5% using a fairly stable investment return is going to have a greater long term impact then getting 5% better return for only a few years. That 5% increasing in your saving rate is going to be compounded every year at roughly 6% after inflation using a passive low fee mutual fund method of investment.  I have no problem with higher risk/high reward investing, but I'm not doing it with my retirement. I saw enough people making bets with their retirement and losing out enough to get stuck in their jobs for an extra 10 years.

If anything, it's a misguided conservative attempt to draw attention away from the distribution and focus solely on economic growth. Make the pie bigger and everyone benefits! Even when they don't.

Economists do tend to argue wealth is not a zero sum game because we can create more by producing more, thus increasing the size of the proverbial pie. This point is where I disagree with them, and think we'd both be on the same page.  My main issues are with this point:   Remember when you were a teenager, learned about poverty and thought that if only everyone had money, the problem would be solved? Later on you realized what would happen: Inflation. The value of money would go down, all the food would become more expensive and a whole bunch of people would still be poor.   That's a black and white way of phrasing it, it's true this tends to increase inflation, but that doesn't mean it would we be worse, or effectively defeat the purpose of greater income equality. If anything as long as people have their essential needs met it would be preferable even if the non-essentials became more expensive. You seem to be saying the world is every man for himself and the best we can do is to embrace it.   In college, you're educated mostly by naive idealists, who tell you that ""everyone is equal"" and ""if we all work together we can all benefit"". They claim to emphasize intellectual freedom and ""critical thinking"", just as long as you don't think anything that could be ""offensive"".

But what happens then? The poor who would have developed a drug addiction go on to do something productive. Instead of being a negative pull on society, they contribute. They raise children who are healthy and happy. They can break the cycle of poverty.  Mass education does mean most people have degrees - and then our businesses are filled with educated people.  Mass education has its problems but it does have incredible benefits. We mass educate 10,000 people to find that one who makes a medical breakthrough or figures out how to improve the efficiency of solar panels by 1%. These types of incremental advances are ultimately the ""product"" of education (amongst other things).  Sure, from the perspective of getting a degree and still can't get a job it doesn't appear to be worth it. But every advance we have in our society often has someone who has self-educated or was churned through that dumb university machine.  There are plenty of studies that show giving money to the poor has outsize rewards - this means it is not zero sum. A poverty study in Australia found every $1 spent ended up saving (I think) about $1.30 or so. It was actually profitable to help the poor.  Yes, sometimes from an individual perspective, things seem fucked. And yes, education needs massive reform (being free for starters). But money and education are not zero sum.

Additionally, the Christians established an elaborate form of Welfare, through anarchist communes, which is nigh-impossible for others to understand.

lostgeneration,3cofj6,negroyverde,7,Thu Jul 9 21:02:04 2015 UTC,The only oppressive thing is the cold. Why do Americans travel then?
lostgeneration,3cofj6,monsunland,-4,Fri Jul 10 00:01:54 2015 UTC,"There's different kinds of travelers. There's the 'off the beaten track' types. My friend for instance hitchhiked the highway up from South America to Mexico. Part of the appeal is that he didn't know what he would find, he was in unregulated environments, the streets hat pot holes, the busses were rusted and rickety, and yes he could have gotten robbed.   Then there's also the resort type, who stayes in a resort when they go to Mexico. Or the type that likes to go to Western European countries but avoids 3rd world countries. They want predictability, security, and no risk.  There's heaps of problems with countries like Laos and Thailand, where I am now. The mafias run these countries (less so in Laos which is actually very civilized, if unpredictable). I hate that. But in Denmark, it's just a different system of control and oppression. Each has it's own drawbacks, typical of the difference between Southern, hot countries and Northern cold countries. The situation between Greece and Germany exemplifies this. Greece, while not as bad as Italy, is run by ancient family lines that take steps to prevent market competition and maintain monopolies.  In the South these families impede individuality. In the North, the governments do. In a mafia run country, if you start a lemonade stand the competition might burn it to the ground as a warning. In a Northern country, you might end up in jail.  But I see a lot more freedom in Bangkok than I see in a city like Vancouver. In Vancouver, if you open a taco stand the police will shut you down. In BKK it's incredibly easy to start a small business. Anyone can do it. No permits necessary. All you need to do is pay the cops a little sometimes, depending on what you are selling (counterfeit DVD's and soccer jerseys usually require someone to pay the cops off here).   I have to conclude that there is more freedom in Thailand than there is in Denmark or London or Canada or even the USA. But there are tradeoffs."

Lack of education, clean water, affordable housing... Thailand is 'fun' but let's not pretend it's not a developing country and doesn't have tons and tons of problems--poverty, bribery, corruption, horribly inefficient government bureaucracy... just to name a few. I mean look how many of their women are forced into child prostitution. Just from that I have to conclude they're much less free--no one becomes a prostitute at 12 by choice."
lostgeneration,3cofj6,drew3000,-2,Fri Jul 10 01:59:58 2015 UTC,"Lack of education, clean water, affordable housing   School is very inexpensive for Thais if they desire to get an education. I will agree that in rural areas farmers don't have good access to education but they actually make very good money. Thailand is a '2nd world' country and it actually has a lot of wealth. Farmers make bank here, even if they are illiterate.  Housing? Okay sure there's not a lot of affordable housing but squatting is rampant. See an abandoned building? Okay, you can live there. Can you do that in Denmark?   Clean water? There's clean water everywhere. Inexpensive water filtration machines. Thais always have access to clean water to drink. Sure they still get exposed to bacteria, but there's this thing called gut immunity. If you live in an environment where you never get exposed to bacteria, you don't develop immunity. Part of the problem with eliminating risk.   You gain something, you lose something. That's how this works. If you want to create a perfect, risk free society, well you can't. And if you try, say hello to fascism.   And yes there is a problem with prostitution here. But it has been that way since the war in Vietnam. Much less of a problem in Laos, which I like. Laos is a great country and the people are happy there. You would deny them that? You going to go to a Laotian and tell them their country is fucked up, it needs to be more like Denmark?

Also, as I said, any money paid to the government goes to past debts, not current liabilities.

They know people will borrow to attend.  If there were no student loans available, colleges would not be able to charge so much. They'd have to (gasp) charge what students could afford.  Borrowed money allow students to pay more than they otherwise could afford. Just like cheap interest rates on home loans allow people to bid more for houses.  $1,000 per month is 30 years of monthly payments at 4.39% interest to buy a $200,000 house.  If interest rates were higher, like say 7.02%, then $1,000 per month only buys a $150,000 house.  Well, when the Federal government hands out student loans to anyone who is accepted at a college or university regardless of major or prior academic performance, then colleges and universities will keep raising prices. Even private lenders get in the game, knowing student loans can't be discharged by bankruptcy.  The government could have done something smarter. Like fund free state community colleges. Then make bachelor-degree granting institutions compete for students and be the loan-granting institutions so they have skin in the game... and at the same time make student loans dischargeable by bankruptcy so they'd be more selective about who they admit while giving students an out."

Sink a country that's currently denying it's half way under already?    While it is certainly not headed in the right direction (Funny how the more the government grows, and more oversight they claim the worse people are doing - yet bozo's keep calling for more government), it is a long way from ""half way under"". It is still the economic engine of the world more or less. It still has the highest number of obese ""poor"" people, and its ""poor people"" are better off than 99% of all the other people on the planet...but yea, times are real tough."

Yet, in the last two decades, like in the case of many other developed nations, its growth rates have been decreasing. In the 50’s and 60’s the average growth rate was above 4 percent, in the 70’s and 80’s dropped to around 3 percent. In the last ten years, the average rate has been below 2 percent and since the second quarter of 2000 has never reached the 5 percent level. Our country’s GDP growth has been steadily declining since the 1950’s where the average growth rate was above 4%. We haven’t seen anything near 5% annual GDP growth since the beginning of this century – over 14 years ago. It is going be very difficult for a country like the United States to prosper and maintain our standard of living when the average annual GDP over the last 10 years has been BELOW 2% per year. http://www.seeitmarket.com/past-10-years-us-gdp-growth-reveal-disturbing-trend-14156/  Also worth looking at: http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/06/speedup-americans-working-harder-charts http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/measuring-americas-decline-in-three-charts"

European countries with a large number of poor immigrants are similarly seeing a political pushback against their social safety nets. There are also countless other characteristics: culture, precedent, corruption, etc. that make it uncertain whether a welfare state would be as effective in the USA as it is Europe (if you can even call it effective in Europe, which is also debatable)  Korea has a pretty good single payer system but Korea is also a homogenous society with low immigration (although even that is changing now) where its citizens care about each other because they share a common history and culture spanning thousands of years.

What's the solution for him? Because he was fucked from day one we simply say ""welp, glad it ain't me!""  Yes we have lots of stories of immigrants coming over with $8 in their pocket and making a great life for themselves. My great grandfather is one such example. My grandparents on each side were able to work low-paid jobs and raise 4 kids each, who went on to earn amazing college and post-grad degrees and buy big houses and cars and all that shit. That's the American Dream story we love. Everyone in my family history worked hard for it. But the point is, no matter how hard anybody works now, such mobility is increasingly impossible.  My grandfather was a fucking milk man in Chicago raising 4 kids and supporting his stay at home wife. A milk man! And all 4 of his kids could afford to go to college after working summers during school. They all went on to get pretty solid careers and make nice lives for themselves.  I'm privileged that I come from such a background and had help (only help! No amount of work done in high school could have paid my full tuition...minimum wage was $6/hr when I was in high school, my college tuition was ~$15k a year!). I have a great career and save frugally. But that's only because my parents themselves had stellar careers, earned big bucks in the go-go 90's, and their own parents earned enough to support a basic home, and minimum wage in their time relative to the cost of education was enough for them to get themselves started without their parents help.  That doesn't exist anymore.  No one is saying we need to make sure every kid can become a heavyweight champion or whatever other bullshit you think this is about. Everyone is saying that it's absolute bullshit that we acknowledge the education and a career path are the ways of escaping poverty and yet huge swaths of our society are systematically barred from even the opportunity of earning enough for education. Education and affordable living has become literally impossible for certain segments of our population.  If your stance is, ""so fuck 'em."" Then fine! Please at least just admit that so we all know what you're on about in each of these replies. I think that's a heartless stance, but I can't fault you for feeling that way. Life is ruthless and some people respond to that by saying ""fuck you, I got mine."" That's fine. At least we know.  I don't think anyone here believes every person deserves a McMansion like so many of the boomers got in the last generation. We don't need or want that. We want the opportunity to support ourselves and work hard to improve our lot in life.  No amount of smarts or hard work will enable a person at the bottom rising up anymore. That's the problem we all have, here.  You are worried about government spending, we are too. A person at the bottom needs government assistance to make ends meet, but they barely do just that. So a person goes their whole life working 2-3 jobs, earning minimum wage, supplemented by our government, and never rising up. That is WASTE.  We would prefer someone using government assistance during a rough patch, being able to actually afford education (and time to go to classes!) to earn a better position, and then get the fuck off government assistance so we can spend it on education and health resources instead of just keeping people circling the drain."

Ohh please, time after time more government interference hurts more both directly and indirectly, which brings out the calls for more help from the government, and the entire thing is a vicious circle. It isn't ""fuck them, I've got mine"", my stance is ""Stop asking for government to cause all this problems so you can pat yourself on the back for ""trying"" to do good"" You don't help them. The government doesn't. You are exasperiating a tiny problem into a huge one and like Mr. Magoo your sense of ""doing good"" is leaving a path of destruction behind you.     We want the opportunity to support ourselves and work hard to improve our lot in life.    You already have that. You are choosing not to take advantage of the very same system as those new immigrants do on the daily. Instead you'd prefer to blame the 1%, or republicans, or teabaggers, or Koch bros, etc... while online claiming what people are doing, can't be done. Stop it. Just fucking stop it, because there might be some foolish people here that will think what you are saying is true, and they too will give up. Like Mr. Magoo, leaving that path of destruction you fail to even acknowledge.   No amount of smarts or hard work will enable a person at the bottom rising up anymore. That's the problem we all have, here.  And yet immigrants do it on the daily and always have. Even without the use of bolding. Maybe they are just smarter than us? Short of that, if they can do it without knowing the langauge, the culture, the ins and outs, and not having the decades long chances to build connections and little to know family help - the only reasonable conclusion is that they want it more than we do. That isn't a failing in the system, that is a failing in us.     A person at the bottom needs government assistance to make ends meet, but they barely do just that.    Again, you are missing the initial. Many (not all), but many of those people on the lower rung are there because of the multitude of government programs, government regulation, etc that have kept them from accessing employment at their level, stopped them from acquiring work skills, etc that stopped them from working their way up. Again, you are asking/expecting/wanting the government to solve a problem it created. This is the height of idiocy.     That is WASTE.    I agree, which is why you get government out of it and let that person develop to their potential. Something that doesn't happen when you are coddled, told it isn't your fault, legally kept unemployable, and legally kept from working your way up so you will always be a good little dependent of the state and thus refuse to criticize it and the state gains more and more power as it creates ""accidentally"" more and more dependents.     We would prefer someone using government assistance during a rough patch, being able to actually afford education (and time to go to classes!) to earn a better position, and then get the fuck off government assistance so we can spend it on education and health resources instead of just keeping people circling the drain.    Of course you would. However that doesn't happen because it is antithetical to the nature of government and people... But when a philosophy priorities feels > reals, that is to be expected."

You still need to understand the curriculum and pass whatever tests are designed to prove you understand the material and can apply it to real world problems. So whether you earn that for ""free"" or need to pay for it, you still need to prove you've earned a skill or expertise before others will pay you for it.  For example, I do not have a design degree, but I taught myself photoshop, illustrator and basic web design for free online through various tutorials. I created a portfolio of different projects with what I learned. I was able to get my first post-college job (since no one was hiring for the skills from my major at the time) using this portfolio. I did all this for ""free,"" but still needed to use my time and my brain and create a way to prove what I know and can do.  Increasing the number of people in our population who have desired and hireable skills is a good thing. These people, whether they earn their skills for ""free"" or not, will fill employment gaps, earn wages, and then spend those wages in the economy, which will prompt more growth and more demand for work. Consider it an investment.  Most companies today don't care if I have an expensive design degree from an Ivy League school or if I bootlegged software off the internet and taught myself. They have a budget to keep and projects to get done. If the candidate can prove they can do the work, they will get hired. They will get paid, and spend their earnings."

My outsider's opinion is that if you need more money than that average FAFSA award, you need to rethink your options.

Earlier this year, for example, a prominent Democrat compared delaying the confirmation of Loretta Lynch as attorney general (she’s the first African-American woman to be given the role) to Jim Crow segregation. Elsewhere, questioning certain sexual-assault statistics makes one a ‘rape apologist’; proponents of traditional marriage are dismissed as ‘bigots’; and even President Obama is called sexist for arguing with Senator Elizabeth Warren about a trade bill (he called her ‘Elizabeth’).  Progressives think their vitriolic name-calling undermines their opponents.

No.   traditionally just the act of graduating from college or high school signaled the crossing of a threshold   I find the use of the word tradition disturbing here. The author clearly feels like whatever was normal for their life is just how things have been for, um, centuries? Millennia? Only 200 years ago, there was no such thing as school or even childhood. Agrarian labor was your life as soon as you could pay attention. The author's stupid expectation is to presume that all of history leads to Me! Education, as practiced in the modern era, is only about 150 years old and was not widespread until the 20th century.  This whole situation of delayed entry into the workforce has me thinking about what they call the Luddite fallacy. Maybe it's not a fallacy and never was. Is it possible that for 200 years, civilization got away with simply delaying the start of a person's work life to offset the reduced need for working people? Education did follow quickly after industrialization. At first, kids would stay in school 'til about 12. Then later it was normalized as 16-18. Now it is 22-25. Textbooks tell us that the reason for education was job preparation. But what if it was simpler? What if society needed to stall a 12 year old's entry in the workforce for a bit so that there was enough surplus wages for a father to provide for a family? Education could simply be a (temporal) delaying placeholder while society gets ready to have greater numbers participate.  People beginning their lives by paying for entry to the marketplace and then the ticket is no good? Beyond stupid."

lostgeneration,3cg8oh,flacciddick,6,Wed Jul 8 02:01:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed.   If we need to delay entry into the workforce via additional education (for the sake of the macroeconomy), then we shouldn't be charging to do so.  I'm pretty sure the 'war on drugs' has the same impact, just like traditional wars....remove people from the economy.   So our choices are:    Death/dismemberment via traditional war. Being temporary unavailable while surviving a traditional war. Lifetime removal from the economy due to sentencing and forever destroyed employment prospects in the war on drugs. Temporary deferment from the economy while gaining higher education, at an expense that will set us back considerably.   Sorry to bring the war/war on drugs into this.

One of Reagan's 'solutions' to unemployment was military service. Same people, same time came up with the war on drugs and a criminal justice system that disallows anyone ever forgetting that a crime was committed. Later there is a social mechanism in hiring and it's easily understood that those events on your CV are negative qualifications.

I'll come back home after a full day of school and work; and, despite the apartment being empty, he still keeps his door shut all day.  I check on him once a day to make sure he's still alive. He's gained so much weight. I'm sure it's because he's either sitting in a chair or is lying in bed all the time, just watching tv or playing games. He thinks it's funny that his step-counter doesn't cross 1,000 steps a day. His physical health appears to be declining.  He's no longer interested in hanging out, making friends, or having romantic interests. I know he's running out of money.

There's not even evidence that population density affects humans the same way it affects rats due to major differences in social communication - almost everything rats do socially is determined by sense of smell, so the experiment essentially robbed the rats of their most important physical sense.   And even if humans do suffer under overpopulation, the population density in the experiment far exceeds the population density of the largest human cities."

lostgeneration,3cff9w,Bay1Bri,19,Mon Jul 13 08:35:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, rats have a pretty rigid social hierarchy, which they communicate largely through smell.  If they're unable to use urine marking and pheromones to say ""Hey, I'm the alpha rat!"" (because those smells are getting lost in the smells of hundreds of other rats), then they have no way to communicate except by aggression.  Rats also can't mate without a functional sense of smell (if you surgically remove a rat's ability to detect pheromones, it will lose almost all interest in mating).  Excessive grooming is a sign of stress in rats, not vanity.  So I think people have made a lot of mistakes in applying human characteristics to Calhoun's ""beautiful ones.""   Rats that groom a lot, cluster together and don't mate aren't vain metrosexuals who have forgotten how to be masculine.  They're just incredibly stressed rats whose senses are so overloaded that they can no longer detect females or determine social order."

He could have actually expanded the maze during the third generation, but it wouldn't have mattered. By then, all gender norms would have been abolished, and the rats wouldn't even have bothered to venture out.   If he was smart, he should have realized that by reintroducing 'normal' rats to the population, the population would rebound, then collapse again.

Hume called this the principle of uniformity of nature.    The problem calls into question all empirical claims made in everyday life or through the scientific method and for that reason the philosopher C. D. Broad said that ""induction is the glory of science and the scandal of philosophy"".

Well that's not true...   because most people have no idea what the Luddites were or why they were angry.   I suppose I just wish people would put an ounce of effort into understanding someone's position before downvoting. Luddites did not hate technology, nor did they fear it. Their issue was with the implications of technology and it's impact on their lives and ability to fulfill their financial obligations. Particularly given that their society did absolutely nothing whatsoever to help some of it's hardest working skilled employees transition to other work. No. They rightly feared the implications of technological progress in the absence of any kind of support system for the displaced, their last-ditch effort to draw attention to their plight was violently quelled, and they've now been miscategorized as people who 'hate technology'."

""Luddite Fallacy"" as it is commonly used by economists is a term used to describe the fear that tech advances will displace workers without creating new jobs into which they can transition.

In reality, imitating the rich is a guarantee of poverty -- those rich kids' grandparents certainly didn't become rich studying art, literature, or philosophy, and just being around rich kids doesn't mean that those kids will suddenly forget that you are poor.   The poor kids that follow in the footsteps of the rich rather than in the footsteps of the rich family's fortune founder (who to be fair is usually an awful monster of a person) remain poor, and the rich are left more secure than before.   This is also why universities that cater to the upper class tend to seek out the smartest poor kids -- it's a form of class-based brain-drain that either neutralizes them by encouraging them to study the arts or whatever and spend all their time trying to become genteel, or it trains them to see themselves as servants to the rich; racing to get that coveted position at the Big [Industry] firm, rather than as people who could be their competitors."

For someone who had a contact at the National Center for Education Statistics, the author gives little statistical analysis.  If a correlation between parents' income and choice of major did exist, you'd expect a more pronounced difference in the distributions in the first graph, and yet they are practically overlapping... and they are only showing 1 sigma.    Since only 1 sigma is shown, remember that a full 16% of students in any of those majors had parents that made less than the lower whisker of the distribution.  For statistical comparisons of populations, typically 2 sigma are used; the populations are basically the same, perhaps with the exception of Associate's and Law Enforcement.    Even ignoring the sigmas and just looking at means, there is no clear trend.  Education, psychology, and law enforcement (does a firefighting major even exist?) are typically low-paying yet you still see them at the low end of the distribution.  Wouldn't you expect to see engineering and business at the low end, and philosophy at the high end?  The distributions are so wide, they are probably influenced by whether the student has 1 or 2 parents that work, divorced parents, or SAHM, which isn't really taken into consideration in the analysis."

Even more than that number (93 million) are working jobs like bartending but have college degrees. So somehow almost 94 million Americans are living but not working or even looking for jobs. Unemployment rate has gone way down (to 5.3%, which is nearly as low as it can possibly go) but only people who are not working but are looking for jobs are counted in that, so when these people give up, or aren't making enough to pay their bills but are working, they don't count as ""unemployed"" anymore.

You can't just assume young people are disappearing as the old increase the ranks of the non-participating labor force because we're constrained by 5.3% unemployment which is very near the conventional NRU. If anything it's more ridiculous because the millennial generation is larger than the boomers; certainly is if you count gen-x. The young are losing ground, it's pretty simple.

Here's an animated chart that shows how the percentage of Americans who are young and old has radically changed due to baby boomers. I really suggest watching it. Boomers are completely tipping the scales. The percentage of young people working is lower despite a record number of jobs because the percentage of old people is so unprecedentedly huge, and some of them are holding on to their jobs, leaving them unavailable for younger workers. (Another reason is the record percentage of young people in higher education, enrollment in which has always been associated with lower rates of employment.) But still, the number of retired people 65+ is far larger than it ever was before due to the massive growth of the overall 65+ population, and is growing rapidly because 65+ is growing rapidly. Both 65+ workers and 65+ retirees are growing fast, with the former taking jobs away from the young and the latter adding to the ""not in workforce"" numbers. Counting the growing numbers of retired people over 65+ does show a demographic problem, but it distorts any attempt to see how many people are out of the workforce because they want a job but aren't looking, versus how many people are out of the workforce because they have retired (or are stay-at-home parents or students or disabled or just 16-year-old high schoolers who don't want to work)."

The percentage of young people working is lower despite a record number of jobs because the percentage of old people is so unprecedentedly huge, and some of them are holding on to their jobs, leaving them unavailable for younger workers.   Except a change in absolute numbers doesn't inherently explain a change in participation rate. There are probably some generation differences, but presumptively they all need to work. It gets weirder because the boomers had the highest prosperity, so they should need to work the least. Maybe it's because their retirement portfolios tanked and they need to make up the difference before they cash out, either way it doesn't bode well for the economy. And still that we're talking about less than half of the 93 million who aren't participating in the economy, who are all younger than 65. If you look at U6 and the fact wages aren't rising it starts to paint a less rosy picture than 5.3% unemployment suggests. Yeah there can be offsets from people in school, those on disability, or stay at home parents, but then the reserve army of labor also includes off-shoring, H1B1, and other immigrants.   (Another reason is the record percentage of young people in higher education, enrollment in which has always been associated with lower rates of employment.)   Enrollment has been declining for the past four years.   but it distorts any attempt to see how many people are out of the workforce because they want a job but aren't looking, versus how many people are out of the workforce because they have retired (or are stay-at-home parents or students or disabled or just 16-year-old high schoolers who don't want to work).

My depression wasn't solely caused by external pressure as I was also dealing with damage from abuse(not from my parents) while I was a child.   I switched majors and was only able to finally graduate about eight years later after suicide attempts among other things. Even though I was able to get a job in what I went to school for Ill never get my twenties back which Id be more than happy to trade my degree for.

Going to college straight out of high school was not a free decision, my parents didn't force me to but I had absolutely no idea what other options I might have had.  Had a depressive episode late sophomore year and dropped out.  Moved to a different state, got diagnosed bipolar a year later, and now I'm back in school, probably graduating in a year at 26."

It's clear that stress and depression are big issues on college campuses, while the number of true helicopter parents can't be that high.  There are just as many unhappy students at state schools as there are at prestigious private institutions.  ""Helicopter parenting"" has become just as much of a buzzword as ""participation trophies.""  Blame the parents, blame the teachers, blame culture, but never blame big socioeconomic changes.  Parenting gurus draw a sharp line between helicopter and free range, ignoring the 90% of reasonable parents who allow their kids a balance of structured activities and free play."

I mean this whole sexual assault debacle sums it up pretty well – instead of treating college students like adults and letting them drink at bars, let's just turn a blind eye to the fact they drink in totally unsafe environments because it's illegal and send them to sexual assault seminars.   Sure, my parents didn't seek counseling when they went to school, but they did a shit ton of drugs.

lostgeneration,3cbkxd,fullmaltalchemist,9,Mon Jul 6 17:13:48 2015 UTC,"What's sad is that 65 years ago, Kennedy had figured out the value of the US legal/social contract. Deep thinker, Kennedy was. Deeply wanted to create peace and knew that trade was an imperfect but excellent tool for exactly that. In those days, capitalism was squared off against communism--and it was possible to beat communism through trade agreements. We could stop having wars! (btw, not having wars is the key idea of free trade movements--no one shoots a needed business partner) Historians know he was about to stop the war in Vietnam and begin some new foreign policy initiatives when he died. The trick instead of war was to offer equality--invite developing countries into the 'first world' by offering the US as the market. In exchange, the developing country would be required to make a copy of the US economy's structure--by creating laws protecting their own middle class wages with Unions and the Minimum Wage. Instead of that plan, we lost a war in Vietnam, they became communists, and the minimum wage there today is 56 cents an hour.  A lot of informed working people have been upset about 'free trade' over the last 25 years. It's because working people in the US have been asked to compete with 56 cents an hour instead of the Kennedy plan of raising up the Vietnamese people's wages to something like the US level. Recent trade agreements are nothing more than exported corporatism because theirs is the only voice paying to be heard in the drafting and negotiations. What are we exporting? By law, citizens of foreign nations must obey and pay full price to US corporations. Grow your own middle class? Fuck that--corporations want cheap labor so feel free to exploit your people."

lostgeneration,3cacne,AntcuFaalb,6,Mon Jul 6 13:38:49 2015 UTC,"There's been an interesting history since the end of the Civil War, with a perfect storm of things coming together to allow a new generation of the wealthy to seize power.  Start with the egomania of John Rockefeller... without his desire to be on top, his feud with Andrew Carnegie would never have gone as far as it did. What did it do for the masses? Gave us access to transcontinental railroads, affordable steel for buildings and bridges, and affordable, consistent lamp oil. Which then sparked the revolution of Edison's electric light (despite Tesla's technology being better).   During this 30 years, this nation forever changed, and with it, the world. And while innovation had never moved us forward so fast, labor was stuck in the dark ages. So there were revolts. And violent ones. Private security firms were hired to keep Union laborers out. People were shot and killed. Lots of them. But then someone came around with such a novel idea that it not only revolutionized American transportation, but also American life: Henry Ford.  The horseless carriage, in one form or another, had been around for nearly a century (with the earliest, steam-powered three-wheeled carriages showing up in France in the late 1700's), but even the  feud between the Germans and the French over the first true ""automobile"", it wasn't until Henry Ford came out with his first automobile that they were affordable by the common man. And the assembly line changed production and labor forever.  In a span of 50 years, we went from a nation trying to repair the damage of a Civil War to one of the wealthiest in the world. Then the stock market crashed.  Look at the worldwide turbulence in that time. Europe let relatively small differences develop into a Great War. New technology sprung up again and was used in battle to horrific effect (the bi-plane, the submarine in practical form, new machine guns, gas).   We were the strongest nation left after the Great War, and had nearly a decade of opulence at the hand of fair labor, innovation and investment. Until that all came crashing down.  But we weren't the only ones who experienced economic depression. Germany was destroyed in WWI, so much that a charismatic artist grew to rule a new nation. Enter WWII with the knowledge that Japan was on its way to attack Pearl Harbor and FDR had a plan to return Americans to work and repair the nation while defeating Hitler before he took over the world.   I don't think many now how close we were to losing the war.  If not for the first computer, the devastation of Great Britain would have been absolute. If not for the Russians, Germany would have grabbed most of Europe. The Nazis were developing both the Atomic bomb and the jet-turbine engine before we were.  But we were the ones crazy enough to drop the only two Atomic bombs ever used in combat on Japan. And that was that.  Following WWII was a period of heightened egos. America, vastly untouched by the war, continued producing goods at as high a level as they did during the war. We helped others rebuild, and made a metric fuck-ton of money at it. New businesses -- new industries -- sprung up in the decades after the war, and the US saw the greatest boom of all time. So of course, capitalism was good.  But then things started to change. To sustain this level of growth, we always needed a new enemy. Communism: Korea, Vietnam and the USSR. Our greatest asset became our military spending as we became the police force for the world, ensuring no one like Hitler would come to power again. But therein started a major issue: we never really had a checks and balances system for our newfound world power.  Well, others worked to become our checks and balances. The USSR developed nuclear weapons. And France. And the UK. And then dozens of other nations. The world was a much less safe place.  The last 50 or so years have been where it's gotten really crazy. Starting with the assassination of JFK. That was the day part of America died. Conspiracy theories aside, Kennedy did a lot to ensure we didn't die in a nuclear apocalypse, including trying to reform how money is created.  The America we've been given today is a far cry from the America our forefathers penned. There was a time we engaged in a war once every 20 years... now it's more consistent though less vocalized. We have our hands in every aspect of the lives of others, from spying and intel to backroom arms deals. We fund those who will fight for our cause through other nations and abandon them when our goal has been completed. All the while, strengthening the backbone of what makes America great, our corporations.  But this is exactly the problem many are opening their eyes to today... it was never the corporation that strengthened our economy or changed the world... it was our innovation and implementation of new ideas. And that's what we've been lacking for a good long time.  So why don't the poor rise up? Because today, they have distractions. There's enough low-level technology to keep everyone occupied and complacent. iPhones, DirectTV, the internet, Tinder... anything and everything to keep people occupied. Because as long as the masses have roofs over their heads, hot meals on their tables and fuel for their automobiles, not much else matters. That is our only export today. An ideal.  But the fight is getting dirtier. America is soon going to solely stand for the corporation. It's a short-term fix to an ongoing problem. And judging by our past, things are going to get really, really interesting in the next 100 years."

Therin lies the problem is that representative politics delegates the voice of the people into the hands of people whom not only are far wealthier than them but are at the whim of the obligation to raise funds.  This obligation, as most obligations when it comes to being weighted by money ,tends to be placed before the desires and consideration of the needs of people. Profits are put before people, environmental,labor and health concerns take a back seat when it comes to money.  People who do seek out answers or know somethings wrong inevitably becoming pessimistic and nihilistic or continue to repeatedly put their faith in a system that's broken.   There are strands of hope. Some people do fight back or organize such as the Black Lives Matter movment or Occupy Wall Street. But these are the first ground swells and people whom are so adjusted to this ""results now"" attitude quickly dismiss it or absorb mainstream tv talking points.  Ultimately what's needed is a message that tells the population that capitalism is the problem. It is an unstable system that fosters anti-social attitudes and policy decisions that don't have the best interests of the masses in mind. They need an answer and that answer is a reorganization of the workplace and a reorganization of public life where participation in democracy is an obligation people are willing to fulfill instead of today's apathy and dis-empowerment.

I'm not sure that you understand the overall makeup of the Google/Facebook/etc. workforce or how much money they earn.  H1Bs are a small fraction of those workforces, and the suggestion that by and large the workers at these companies are underpaid - when they're basically all so OVERpaid that they're driving one of the biggest real estate bubbles in...I don't know...the history of the world - suggests that you're operating with incomplete data.  Even for H1B workers,   An analysis of records from the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) reveals that the median salary offered to H-1B applicants by some of the biggest tech companies — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft — is well over $100K and continues to rise.   I'm sure that some of these companies use workers on various visas for some of their work, but unless you have a source that ties specific Infosys/Tata/Cognizant workers to specific companies, your position seems unfounded (Cognizant, for example, actually had fewer 2015 H1Bs than Google did - and it was the same in the two preceding years as well)."

The US was the only Democracy to come out on top because it's voters were the only ones willing to invest in the economy, even through taxation. Taxation was necessary, because the market was incapable of utilizing the excess productive supply of its factories. China is going through this right now, but their problem is even worse. Neither the government, nor their free market, is capable of utilizing all of their factories. Hence, the massive debt and failed investments.   As a Trust Fund Baby, I get lectured over and over again by poor faggots about how the Rich act and behave. The ignorance is so astounding, that ~93% of Americans don't realize how Shareholder Capitalism works.   Capitalism fails, from my rich white boi perspective, because the rich don't invest. They just buy back their own shares, while shrinking revenue, to increase their profits. Its a cycle of fucking madness that was cooked up during the Reagonimics era, which is why Capitalism cannot work anymore.   Want to fix Capitalism? Force Corporations to Reinvest their profits through abolishing share purchases. Go back to issuing Dividends, as this will end Short-Termism in markets as well  But Libertarian types are genetically inferior, and cannot understand how human behavior works. There is an autistic characteristic about them that makes them too weak to survive in a non-civilized society. They love Capitalism, but are also its biggest threat to it, because they cannot understand it. (Normal people understand what I am talking about. They may deny it, but they 'feel' it.)   I digress. I just don't want to hear another fucking middle class American talk about economics again. It's so unbearable. It's like hearing Christians talk about Evolution."

That leaves 8 hours a day to sleep, eat, and the three S's.  Assuming that there is a lunch break on the job add 30 minutes onto each jobs work time per day. Then there is travel time between said jobs (they are right next door to each other, and their work times don't overlap?) (and what are you laughing at? Lunch breaks?) Anyway, that accounts for at least 134 hours out of a possible 168 hours in a week, the other 34 hours a week being leisure time for the 4 S's (you ate on your lunch break didn't you?)   Why, that's a whole 5 hours and 40 minutes a day for yourself.    Yeah, sounds like you need some amphetamines to keep you going.   Since amphetamines are illegal, you will need to get some MethTM. However, Meth is expensive (so would a prescription of amphetamines), so you probably need a fourth job to pay for the Meth.  So now you are working 160 hours out of 168 hours per week, leaving 8 hours leisure time for the 4S's. But, your on Meth, so you got that going for you."

Like a typical addict, it is not the EU's role or even in its power to help Greece. The only one who can help Greece is Greece. We are talking about a circumstance of addiction that is akin to having been sent to jail for some petty crime for not the first time.

lostgeneration,3c36s3,NetPotionNr9,7,Sat Jul 4 11:08:42 2015 UTC,"I don't get the mentality of appealing to stereotypes about lazy Greeks. This is about the problems of international trade.   Two countries with radically different economic development levels can't practically be bound to the same currency. Here's how free trade should work:  Germany is a more developed country than Greece. It has more automation, higher levels of education, and greater wealth overall. It can afford to produce goods at a lower cost than Greece can. This causes Germany's exports to rise. Lots of Greeks buy cheap German goods.   However, those Drachmas eventually have to find their way back to Greece. Lots of Greeks are looking to sell Drachmas for German goods, but few Greek exports are competitive. In time, the value of the Drachma relative to the German Mark declines. Thus, German goods become more expensive for Greeks to buy, and Greek goods become cheaper for Germans to buy. Eventually, capital flows in to Greece, boosting domestic production until the trade imbalance is eliminated.  That's how free trade is supposed to work. With the Eurozone, Germany basically figured out a way to prevent its own exports from becoming too expensive. At the same time, less developed European countries had to pay the price to allow this. Germans got rich with an artificially cheap currency, and southern European countries were driven deep into debt as they were stuck in a permanent trade imbalance with Germany."

There is this somewhat weird victim mentality that is not unlike how spoiled people behave when they take all the things they have in their life for granted and have a distorted mentality that they are owed something even though they don't want to take advantage of all the benefits and advantages that are right in front of them and spend all their efforts on proclaiming how everyone's out to get them instead of helping themselves.   Do you think Germany was somehow divined the position that they are in now? If anything Greece has significant advantages over Germany with a cheap labor force that is supposedly highly educated. Sure, Greece won't be able to compete with Germany on high tech products, but that is not the competitive advantage that Greece could take advantage of. Again, there is this mentality that Greece is a victim because someone else won't come in and plop down high tech manufacturing capacity where Greeks can just show up at. I think that mentality is really the source of the ""lazy Greek"" ""stereotype""; the mentality that there is an expectation for things to happen without doing anything to make them happen.   I don't know what the short term solution is, but I think the mentality and expectations of the people needs to change so they can elect a different type of leaders that don't try to sooth the pain with proclamations of how much of a victim Greece is and then calling the hand that feeds you German food ""Nazis"" and ""Terrorists"" because you don't like German food even though you have no food of your own."

The problem is that from an employer perspective, if the work isn't worth paying someone for, people aren't going to count it as ""real work"" on your resume. This is why they ask for your previous salary on job applications. The salary lets you as an employer know the worth of the employee. When all else equal, all you ahve to go by is what they claim on a resume.  When you say you've done an ""unpaid internship"" and got paid $0, it really means you just served coffee and picked up lunch on a daily basis and didn't get any meaningful skills out of the experience."

lostgeneration,3bv4tw,slapchopsuey,14,Thu Jul 2 12:23:21 2015 UTC,"I agree. But let's look at the actual language here.   Only 22% of Millennials valued helping others as the most important factor in their personal American Dream.   This is such a weird survey question. It's not saying 22% find helping others important, or 22% find helping others to be the most important thing, but 22% valued helping others as the most important factor in their ""personal"" American Dream. I'm not sure about you, but when I hear ""American Dream"", I'm already thinking about ruthless capitalism, claw your way to the top, etc. I don't really see where helping others comes into that, and I think the ""personal"" qualifier can only do so much to push that cliche away. The phrase is extremely loaded.  Not to mention, the group that most valued helping others was only rated 7% higher. I don't think they should be drawing any rash conclusions from this.   Millennials were the group that placed the most importance on having a job that paid well, with 46% saying that was crucial to their attainment of the American Dream.   46% of millennials think they need a good income to succeed? I'm surprised it's not higher.   Millennials placed the most importance of the age groups polled on luxury items, with 32% saying having luxury items were crucial to their attainment of the American Dream.   The most important, huh? Fewer than 1 in 3 said this. So over 2 in 3 polled said it wasn't crucial. Regardless, I'll say again using the phrase ""American Dream"" is extremely loaded. A life of luxury could definitely be said to be part of that definition. It certainly is in popular culture.   Millennials were the most likely among the age groups to value having children. Twenty percent of Millennials said this was an integral part of their American Dream.   So 80% of them said kids weren't an integral part. 80%.   Millennials believe that they will attain the American Dream more than any other group. Of those polled, 31% said they thought the American Dream was alive and well.   So 69% of them said the American Dream was not alive and well. Comparing to the highest age group, I think we might be able to chalk up some of this discrepancy to youthful idealism vs. ""I'm too old and my life is over""."

Lots of millennialist can't secure the lowest level of the pyramid and self-transcendence is rarely actually included, the pyramid usually stops at self-actualization.   Additionally, how did they qualify luxury item and did they explain that to each cohort? A millennial might consider a house a luxury and a smartphone a necessity whereas a boomer, if my parents are any indication, see the exact opposite. It's not that either cohort is wrong, it's just that values have changed. Many millennials see their home as a temporary  place where boomers see their anchor in the universe. Boomers see our phones as toys, where we see them as the equivalent of the worlds greatest library of knowledge and tools. Also, there are tons of reports about how millennials hate cars and like public transport, but luxury vehicles are probably one of the largest luxury industries in America."

I actually like being a lawyer. What I hate is that the partners I work for don't hesitate to mention that they could fire me and find a replacement in the same day. We had 450+ applications for a entry level position in May. Every single time a young associate makes a mistake, they are threatened with termination - literally. Actual termination doesn't happen all that much, in fairness, but that is primarily due to how hard we all push to survive. It is hilariously efficient for the firm.  Again, I know I'm lucky, but our firm used to have lock step pay and bonus increases until 2007. Since then, pay increases are discretionary, which means 3% (lockstep was between 8-15%). Starting salaries, NOT adjusted for inflation, are lower than they were in 2005. Pressure to bill is immense. Associates are no longer taken to meet clients because we aren't expected to stick around, and there's really no room for the partnership to grow.   And of course, law school loans. I make 6 figs, but I live in college housing. My 20 year old neighbors must think that I'm on the sex predator registry or something. They can't understand how someone who wears a suit to court everyday can't really afford to go to the bars and have a nice place.   I'll be ok.

It was very similar to what is currently happening in tech. Salaries were HUGE. Partners are seeing this fall apart, the whole ship going down. In a way I don't blame them, really... What do you do when your livelihood is going up in flames? You protect what you can.  I'm curious to see what will happen with the much lower law school applications.

Mothers spent more time rearing newborns, and the educational impacts are regarded as a success. Students in these families showed higher test scores and lower dropout rates. There was also an increase in adults continuing education.[4][5]   and   She found that only new mothers and teenagers worked substantially less. Mothers with newborns stopped working because they wanted to stay at home longer with their babies, and teenagers worked less because they weren't under as much pressure to support their families, which resulted in more teenagers graduating.

And if we can’t speak the same language, it will be very difficult for us to trust one another. Right now, nearly half of all New York City public school students speak a non-English language at home. There’s no problem with other languages, but there is a problem if we can’t talk with one another about issues that matter. And that problem is not relegated simply to cross-lingual barriers. The left has now perverted English itself so that words no longer have meaning. Man no longer means man; it may mean a woman who wants to be a man but has all her female genetics and body parts. Marriage no longer means marriage; it means whatever Justice Kennedy thinks it means today. State means federal for purposes of Obamacare; fine means tax for purposes of Obamacare.

He can shout his nonsense from the rooftops and say, I graduated from UCLA and Harvard and am smarter than you when in reality he's fucking lost in someone else's world.  And then he's used by Fox News to blame other millennials because that's what he is, the same way Fox News hires black correspondents to blame black people so they don't have to.

The scam goes like this.  Before you can hire an H1B, you have to ""prove"" you can't find anyone in the US who meets those qualifications, so to do that this general approach is followed:    Put ads in the usual places and interview at a very attractive price point.  You have no intention of hiring anyone, but you want to know the skills candidates have.   X years in Y, A years in B, Degree in C.... Rewrite position to require X+1 years in Y, A+1 years in B, and Degree in C+R at a less attractive price point.  This is part of the reason you'll see job ads requiring more experience in a framework or skillset than is even possible (such as 10 years in node).  Claim no one has these qualifications, and help a pre-selected H1B custom tailor their resume to claim the qualifications.  Train them on the job because it's cheaper.  Offer job to fresh H1B with implied conditions that wouldn't normally be accepted when hiring US employees (such as deportation if they contradict the boss).    Sometimes step 1 is just replaced with a salary at 1/2 or 1/3 the going rate.  No one with the skills would apply, and the company claims no one has those skills.   Step 3 and 4 are sometimes replaced with sending a US person (who is trained in this position) to an off-shore group.  The US person will then train them in what they need to know, and the off-shore group will take over operations. The US person is then offered a relocation to this place for a steep drop in pay, or they can quit.  That's if they're not just outright laid off."

If an experienced person leaves the company, I can't just hire two college grads to take their place, or even 10 college grads.   To hire a junior person really is to invest in that person, and if you do it right, that junior person is going to reduce the capacity of your more senior people as they mentor them.   Despite that, there is still a good case to be made for having a team with a good mix of senior and junior people. If you can optimize your team for good mentorship, hiring junior people is a no-brainer, they are inexpensive to hire and plentiful. It's hard to imagine just how much you still have to learn after you just spent all those years in school, but there's a real reason there is such a strong favor for experienced people!

But why in the world would you (general you; non-accusatory) label these positions asking for 5+ years experience as ""junior"" or ""entry level"" if you're not attempting to cheat a potential new employee out of money?   The thing for some of us out there - truthfully, I can only speak for myself - is that we'd love to be taken on by a company getting paid a base salary and learning and earning over time, just parking at a company for the rest of our lives and working our butts off for them.  I mean, I would be head over heels if I could find a job with a livable wage (no, I do not want to hit it big, I do not want 3 cars, I do not want a pool, I do not want a really fancy house) and benefits. Even if I had to move to another state or country where they were teaching me everything I need to know with the implication I would be staying there at least 5 years if not longer, with a slow-but-steady wage increase over time, with the possibility of eventually making my way up in the company if I'm producing great work and have been proving myself to be useful to the company at large and have shown that I can handle taking on additional responsibilities and workload."

My employer has engineer I, engineer II, specialist I, specialist II, specialist III, principle, staff scientist, and technical fellow. Our requirements are strict but engineer I is 0-1 year experience and engineer II is around 2 years experience. There are still entry level jobs out there."

Entry level is not about you...it's about the company.  Some companies (not all of them, mind you...but Netflix is one handy example) just plain don't hire people with less than five years of experience.  That means for that company, five years of experience IS a junior, entry level position.  Since these companies also tend to offer salaries that are within market ranges for that amount of experience, new employees are not getting cheated out of anything.    Personally, I question that strategy - in my experience, it's good to bring on junior people over time because they bring new ideas to the company and they tend to be more energized and less jaded - but it's up to each company how they want to run their business.  I think the lack of jobs that train you up as you describe is partly because of a gradual erosion that happened between employers and employees: because employees tend to move around from job to job a lot more now - in part because companies don't offer the kinds of benefits they used to in order to get employees to stay, and in part because a lot more companies regularly lay people off...so it's not like it's entirely ""employees' faults"" - and that means the time and money they spend training you is more or less expected to walk out the door at some point.  So: they look for people that already know what they're doing and have been doing it successfully."

The problem, IMHO, is that companies seem too short sighted.  They don't have a pipeline of talent so if your senior people leave, you aren't completely SOL.  Hiring is completely reactionary, probably because it's easy to figure out how much each person's salary and benefits are as opposed to how much work you're loosing or is not getting done."

Being tied to their sponsoring firm, Matloff adds, they “dare not switch to another employer” and are thus “essentially immobile.”6 For their part, Bach and Warner warn, “it may be risky for you to give notice to your current employer.” Indeed, the perils include deportation if you can’t quickly find another guarantor.

I watched the growth of IT training in the late 90s, and it was the most gawdawful flood of poorly prepared people. Corporations were simply taking the money from anyone for certifications and HR departments bought into the idea that certs could help them understand the process of selecting candidates. It was a big nope.  Management people see their own name at the top of organization charts and (in their imaginations) assign all of the competence to themselves. Far too often that is the exact failure--they are incompetent and rose through other means. Meanwhile, from the article: ""There are things that workers know about their jobs that nobody else knows."" Management demands the privilege of not listening to the people who understand the complexities of the work."

In exchange, non-union employees pay a small fee, much smaller than regular union dues, to help cover the cost of collective bargaining. Union members pay regular dues that cover collective bargaining but also other union activities and political action which non-union members do not have to pay for.   Basically, since all employees are covered by the same contract, and that contract benefits from collective bargaining, all employees have to pitch in a bit to cover the cost of negotiations.

You can't have it both ways: all the benefits of a union negotiated contract without paying into the negotiation.   Legally, if you are covered by a union contract, you pay in to cover the cost of negotiations. That's the law, but it's also fair and ultimately benefits and protects all workers. Even those who will complain about being levied a small fee in exchange for a beneficial service.   Without a union, we are all independent contractors with no bargaining power at the mercy and whim of potentially capricious employers. Rationale like yours is the cause of rapidly declining union membership and, as a result, standard of living for the average American.   Right to work states have lower wages than non right to work states, fewer benefits, and less access to health care. How's that working out for the 99%?"

That's why we need a government that fights for the middle class, to balance the corporate power of the 1% selfishly fighting for itself.   Can governments be differentiated from corporations? In my opinion, governments and corporations are identical. The only difference is that the former is invested with legislative power and authority for the enforcement of laws, whereas the latter is not.   Capitalism and ""trickle-down"" BS concentrates wealth. Socialist governments do a better job of taxing disproportionate wealth, which helps the middle class have more benefits, work, and success opportunities.   Agree regarding the first statement regarding ""trickle-down economics."" But in socialist countries, are not governmental officials obscenely rich while the citizens suffer in abject poverty? I refer to Cuba, to the USSR, to Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. I will concede that Scandinavian countries, which are unquestionably socialist, are admittedly prosperous. But Scandinavian countries are supported by the ECB and the eurozone, which is teetering on the brink of disunity. And this country is far more racially and culturally heterogeneous than Scandinavian countries. Are there cultural consequences to the implementation of socialist policy? Are not individuals selfish by nature, and unwilling to voluntarily contribute for the betterment of their fellow man? If that is so, is coercion the only way to rectify this situation? Are there any alternatives?   At least socialists can be elected (and impeached) by people. Who elects/impeaches shareholders and CEOs making billions of dollars while doing nothing for social progress? Not the people...   True. But governments also have weapons and courtrooms at their disposal. If individuals realized that commodity worship is a racket, then those shareholders and CEOs you refer to would be impoverished. That is a utopian statement, but it's nonetheless valid.   The first step to take money out of politics is to elect candidates that pass policy to strengthen the middle class. Elections shouldn't be about money, they should be about grassroots support from workers - the people who actually build America.   Veterans built America, in my opinion. History has demonstrated, time and time again, that candidates elected to ""strengthen the middle class"" inevitably succumb to the temptation of greed.

One method uses a bar of soap which is placed in a person's mouth; the person can then be forced to hold it for a period of time and/or swallow it.  Washing out mouth with soap is most often used as a response to profanity, lying, biting,  tobacco use, or verbal disrespect. It functions both as a symbolic ""cleansing"" following the infraction, as well as acting as a deterrent due to the foul aftertaste. It is commonly used as child discipline or school discipline, and is more frequently employed by mothers than fathers.   Liquid soap, dishwashing liquid, or certain other liquid or solid cleansers may be used; in the case of liquids the person may be forced to swallow or to swish the liquid in his or her mouth for a period of time. The used product may also be brushed onto a person's teeth and/or oral soft tissues using a toothbrush.

It's still possible and better than being fucking miserable at work for the rest of your life.  Edited to add: Also, technically Right-to-Work refers to US states where people who work in union workplaces but don't want to pay dues can opt out of paying them. This doesn't mean that the union is meaningless, but it certainly weakens it as a huge part of what builds a powerful union are resources like organizers, lawyers, strike funds, office space, etc. Without dues paying members, the union could basically become a volunteer organization that is super ineffective.  What I think you're referring to is At-Will Employment, which almost every state is (I think there's one that isn't, but I might be wrong). That means bosses can just fire workers for any reason at any time, so long as it isn't overtly targeting a worker who is part of a protected class (i.e., discrimination). Even then, shitty bosses can find a way. EX: 'I don't like you cuz you're black, but, I'm not firing you cuz you're black - it's because you came in 10 seconds late this morning.'"

I have seen workplaces that have workers like you describe organize. Organizing is bringing people together to win change. That can - and usually does - include building social and workplace ties that isolate problematic anti-collective action workers and/or other management suck-ups.

If they take away your free bus rides or whatever you can just quit, go to a competitor, and get a $10,000 bump in salary.   If tech workers unionize, everyone might lose their free spa days or pet sitting so by being anti-union, they are voting for their own self interests. It's just that tech workers have more leverage against their employers than say fast food workers. You can grab anyone off the street and show them how to work a register, you can't do that with programmers, graphic artists, or network engineers."

The thing is, when the labor market is tilted in favor of workers, such as you describe, that actually ought to make organizing easier. If I and my coworkers can come together and tell our boss what's what while knowing that if management decides to illegally shitcan us then we can easily find other work, all the better. We also make more money than waiters or janitors and are more likely to be able to pursue legal remedies to violations of the law.

It's a huge jump for your marginal tax rate to go from 15% to 25%, but many ordinary folks have to deal with it living in high cost of living areas even though they aren't ""better off"" at the end of the day. An extra 10% for each marginal dollar earned just because all things equal, everything happens to cost more where you live...  This is by design as the legal theory behind the justification states [paraphrase] that the government's role isn't to subsidize people's lifestyles. Choosing where you want to live is deemed a lifestyle choice in the USA and the tax code won't bend just because a dollar gets you less goods and services in one state versus another.   If you have to make $100,000K to live a $50K lifestyle, you'll still get taxed as if you're making well above average even if in your state, cost of living dictates that a household needs $100K just to pay all the bills."

The dorms were like the military in that they provided free housing, food, and clothing as long as you participated in a program to make you more employable or to obtain more education all of which was also free.   Also, the cheapest apartment that you could buy would be a studio apartment. That is a one room, space with a bathroom off to the side and a kitchennette with sink in the same room that your bed would be in. These types of places would sell for around $10,000.   The way the system worked is that people would pay upfront so they would pay $10,000 and the landlord would use that money to invest earning them interest. The interest the landlord earned on that money was what ""rent"" was and at the end of your year if you didn't want to buy the apartment you would get your $10,000 back.   Once you have the first $10,000 to get a small studio your only expenses are utilities and any fees for parking, security, etc.   America has no studio apartments for sale that I'm aware of.

The goal should be to reduce your housing costs as low as possible as that is by far everyone's biggest expense. Usually buying a reasonably priced house allows you to accomplish this because the mortgage gets eaten away by inflation while your pay should attempt to keep pace over the long run.  If you buy what you can afford, then repairs and maintenance aren't very expensive since you should be able to save on top of paying your mortgage and other expenses."

Really only for a large amount of money or if the city is having some economic disaster that has dried up employment and is producing mass evictions (like New Orleans after the hurricane or Detroit after the city's bankruptcy). Landlords would love to subdivide their property into smaller and smaller rentals, though, as they could then slowly raise the rental rates back up to what they were charging for the larger properties. Here they are running into old anti-tenement laws, though, that were designed to prevent the re-creation of 19th century slums, and in more recent times, to create a higher barrier to entry to the marketplace to discourage competitors."

Unlike actual investment, feudalism pays money in a no growth economy.  Quite genius, really.   What I have to wonder, though, is what triggers the free market from playing feudal lords, and back into investments.   It must be from a lack of economic growth, because chasing real estate hasn't historically paid the best. But again, it's just so weird to see Rent go from sensible competition to price gouging."

A job that I had already held for three years earlier.  I had to apply online then apply in person at the store with the online application number. I then had to have a group interview. I then had a 1 on 1 interview.   I then had a group orientation which was pointless because the HR person running it didn't know retail and probably never worked in it.  During this time nobody actually contacted my reference and still manager of the last store I worked at.

Capitalism was introduced to make innovation and efficiency important, and as a result the middle class thrived. It looks like that time is coming to an end but that's not the result of capitalism, quite the opposite (unless you count cronyism as a form of capitalism, but that's insincere).   Of course capitalism didn't came out of nowhere, but you make it sound like it was invented by the lords to be able to repress the people even more, while in fact at the forefront of capitalism were humanists looking for a way to get people out of the drudgery of having no future but to do the work the lords give them."

Consider this: how many things are people paying for every month that they don't want, but need? The more someone is paying out of needs but not of wants, the more ""slave-like"" that someone is.

Hell, using your previous logic I shouldn't even be phased, in the late 90s unadjusted unemployment was below 5% while during the height of the great depression unemployment was 25%, so really everything is just fine when you think about it in those completely irrelevant terms.   No, it's not a strawman, it's an analogy for the purpose of illustrating a point.   People depend on income which is disanalogous to something as trivial as browser speed. What you are seeking to do is trivialize valid complaints, much as your appeal to privation regarding radios is meant to trivialize legitimate grievances about rising economic inequality within society. It's as if to say people of modest means should content themselves with what you find to be adequate all the while previous and attainable dividends from participation within society are on the decline.   Regardless, the USA always ranks above average in Quality of Life (according to the OECD[1] ) and always in the top 20 in Standard of Living (currently ranked 3rd[2] ).   You're clearly being purposely obtuse and disingenuous as you're selectivly responding to my statements; I qualified my claims as being ""relative to productivity and national wealth"" which you are not addressing. I've used standard of living and quality of living interchangeably, but I don't doubt most will understand what I'm driving at as to the ramifications. It is entirely possible for the U.S. to rank high on those metrics, while under-performing relative to capacity i.e. increasing economic inequality which is well documented.12345678"

Changing this function in society from one of top-down control to one that's decentralized would be the most beneficial to society yet we just turn our heads away from it whenever it gets brought up.   Why would one person making decisions be better than many people having a stake in the choice? Are everyday workers just so grossly incapable of understanding the functions of a place they spend the majority of their time? I don't by that. People are still holding on to this belief that one day, they too can be that person with the power who has people working for them.  Ontop of that this comes down to property relations. He who has control of the means of production gets to determine what would be most beneficial to his own rather than what's beneficial for the whole. When the situation in regards to work in society is do it or starve most people have no choice but to accept the cards and conditions that are immediately available to them. If they're lucky they can pay to go to school or accrue large debt to ensure better conditions of survival. Capitalism relies on other people doing a majority of the work and getting paid for such work in an exchange that gives them less money than amount that they create in the workplace. Why should we continue to give such huge power amounts of power to a small group of people?"

I know socialists love to no true scotsman those attempts, but you guys have a lot to answer for. People are scared of socialism because they dont wanna end up in a stalinistic dictatorship, and this is a very legitimate fear.   I'm sorry, but as crappy as capitalism sometimes is, and as legitimate as many socialist arguments have against it, it's STILL better than socialism as it has been tried in various countries.  Not to mention there ARE some benefits to capitalism. Economic growth, rising living standards, some level of freedom and agency. I definitely think that we overdo it a lot and think our current hoo rah patriotism toward the concept is unsettling and greatly exaggerates these benefits, but properly understood, the whole debate between capitalism and socialism is just a massive argument between two crappy options.   Honestly, I'm a solid social democrat ideologically. I'm ultimately pro capitalism, but seriously believe some of the mechanics need to be reworked. I'm all for a masterless society to a degree, but my concept of that is to have one where people can say no to work. In capitalism, you're forced by desperation to work for masters. In socialism, you have a gun to the head. Socialism, as implemented, isnt truly a masterless society. It's just another form of slavery, another form of oppression. Socialists dont deliver on their promises at all.  The least oppressive society to me is one of modified capitalism. One where you have a market based system, but one where workers have more power, and even the freedom to flat out say no and just do their own thing if they wish."

But you had a revolution with the intent to establish socialism, followed by governments that considered themselves socialist. Again, you can talk THEORY all you want, but I dont care about theory, I care about results.   I didn't have a revolution. What took place in Russia was said by lenin to himself to have had established state capitalism. The author explicitly states that what had taken place there became to be known, not as it was in structure but by what it was called in name.   The fact that the state regulates private capitalist enterprises and operates state capitalist enterprises does not reduce the capitalist structure of an economy. So long as employers, private or state, hire laborers to produce commodities and generate profits that the employers exclusively receive, the economy has a capitalist structure. So long as it is exclusively the employers (whether private, state or hybrid; whether more or less regulated) who decide how to use those profits, it is a capitalist structure.  An enterprise only qualifies as ""socialist"" once the distinction between employers and employees within it has been abolished. When workers collectively and democratically produce, receive and distribute the profits their labor generates, the enterprise becomes socialist.   and   In practice, when socialists achieved state power, they either could not or would not use that power to go beyond varying mixtures of regulated private and state capitalism. Yet socialists and their enemies increasingly defined those mixtures as socialism (although some socialists always disagreed and promoted other formulations of what the key terms meant). Conceptual confusions set in about what exactly, if anything, separated state-regulated private capitalism from state capitalism from socialism."

lostgeneration,3bcr4i,Zelaphas,3,Sun Jun 28 02:53:01 2015 UTC,"late 20's. I already tried NZ and Australia on a working holiday visa. But it's hard to get a steady job with one. So my friends and I were stuck to temp work only. Waiting tables, picking fruit, you know. Nothing steady. Then you run out of time / money and you're back home with less $ than before.  Argentina has been doing not so great since 2001 though"
lostgeneration,3bcr4i,Jkid,2,Sun Jun 28 21:40:12 2015 UTC,"Good on you for giving it a go. I guess I lucked out in that I had some STEM experience and used my working holiday visa as an in to New Zealand and finding longer-term work here.  I believe you have the option of going to Canada until you're 35? You could try to find local work to save up and go there and work in oil production (as much as I'm morally against it). I'm sorry your other experiences didn't work out as well, I'm not sure what other advice to give you.  As long as you have Internet access, you can work on building an affiliate link site (like shutupandtakemymoney.com) or other passive income sources. It may not be a huge amount to start but it'll be something.  Do you have any hobbies you're good at? I got my degree in English hoping to teach/write but I always drew and learned how to use Photoshop/Illustrator as a hobby throughout college. When I graduated I couldn't find shit in writing/teaching, but tons of people wanted graphic/web designers and I was able to get into that, and thus turned my career into an IT-oriented one. It may not be as easy these days but I imagine if you have similar talents you may be able to find a startup or mom-and-pop business that will initially hire you on the cheap, then you can build your experience to move onto a new company and ask for a pay raise then."

I am just trying to give the guy some options to think about (but sounds like he's already done a working holiday or two).  If people believe there really aren't opportunities in their home country, they can potentially use working holidays to find work, even ultimately longer-term work, elsewhere. WH visa also allow you to study abroad. This is another expense, sure, but also the potential to earn certification or training in something that can help you land work.  I don't have all the answers, I'm just helping throw out ideas."

lostgeneration,3bcr4i,LuckyVermin,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:00:50 2015 UTC,"WWOOF is something else entirely. A working holiday visa grants you entry into a given country to live and work (temporary work only) for up to a full year. WWOOF is an organisation that sets up ""willing workers"" with ""organic farms"" to provide ~4 hours of daily work in exchange for food and lodging. You may do WWOOFing in the country in which you do a working holiday, but you may also finding WWOOFing opportunities in your home country as well.  Working Holidays are potential outlets to find longer-term work. I used my working holiday to enter New Zealand and get an internship, and once my WH expired we converted my internship into a longer-term employment with the appropriate work visa."

This time for a couple days of the trip, they were actually the ones asking me to play Hold 'Em.  Having said all that, as much as I enjoy Texas Hold 'Em, I've never played it in an actual casino and really don't have much interest in trying.

lostgeneration,3be64v,lukertin,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:57:27 2015 UTC,The problem with playing in a casino is I do not have a ton of money to play on poker. You need to be able to push all the chips in without worring about paying the rent. You also need enough money to not be short stacked (at least 200 dollars). I tried some limit but I do better in no limit.

Most people don't seem to have a handle on how to play tournaments (Seen the big stack at the final table try over and over to knock people out by calling all-ins with marginal hands like A6 or TJ, and end up busting themselves out before the money).  If you have any semblance of skill, you should be able to make the final table at least half the time. Then it just takes some good timing, a little luck, and bad opponents playing badly. At the casino I played, winning 1 tournament out of 5 was breaking even, and even a noob like me managed better."

lostgeneration,3be64v,reginaldaugustus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:49:44 2015 UTC,"As someone who goes with my parents to casinos once in a while, I think that perhaps the problem is, in part a money problem, and in part an odds problem.  I go for fun. I spend very little money. Quite frankly, a whole day at a casino/racetrack can cost about as much as going to the movies in terms of gambling. I dont go to win big, although it's always nice when we do win, and I'm very conservative on betting, having strict spending limits I refuse to go over and focusing on games that allow me to maximize my play value.   That being said, where are the disconnects between millennials and gambling?  Well, first of all, as I said, money. Millennials dont have a lot of money. And most casino games are expensive. I can play for a while on penny slots and horse racing, but table games? $5 a hand on blackjack? Min $5 on roulette? Screw that. Why should spend that on something that last me for 30 seconds when I can instead play something else that lasts for 30 minutes? Maybe if casinos lowered the minimum bet to like $1-2 they could get people, but good luck with that.  Second of all, casinos have an odds problem. Millennials are very educated. They know the odds are stacked against them. A lot of people go to casinos expecting to win a lot of money, and play like jack***es. They win, they win, they win, and then they bet it all and lose. They dont respect statistics, they dont respect the odds. Then you got old people wheeling oxygen tanks around sitting at slot machines for hours blowing their life savings. They dont care if they lose, but they like the thrill of trying to win.   But honestly? Any rational person knows when you go to a casino you dont win money all the time. They know the odds are stacked against you and long run, you lose. Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose, most of the time I end up coming slightly behind. I think that's average. If you bet like $20 over the course of a day, you can probably expect to realistically lose $2-4 on average. Sometimes you get your butt kicked and lose $10-15, sometimes you win $10-15 ahead, or more. I know last time I went my dad hit 45 on the money wheel, that was awesome, but pretty much a statistical anomaly. I think that's the only time I've ever seen 45 come in. To be like truly addicted to gambling to the point you'rea loyal customer like people mentioned above, you need to completely throw odds out the window. You need to focus on that one time you hit 45 on the money wheel and not all those times you walked away with $10 less in your pocket. You focus on that one time you hit a trifecta for $300 and not all those times you lost again, and again, and again. A lot of people who are really heavily into gambling have a certain cognitive bias in which they over remember the times they win and ignore what they lose.  I like to gamble once in a while, sure. But I generally do it smart, and I really dont spend that much. I'm not exactly a casino's prime customer, because I know that realistically speaking, every dollar I have would be better spent on something else. I only do it because I have fun. And only when it's affordable. If you do it that way, it's not much more expensive than going to the movies or something, discounting gas and food to get out to one. I just think of it as a day out. A way to have fun. I'm not in it with unrealistic expectations to win."

There is nothing ""universal"" about it, and rather obviously it will only apply to certain ""western"" nation citizens (or at least those who are able to gain and/or maintain position/status as a ""citizen"" of those nations).  It's basically a system to make the vast majority of the population entirely dependent upon a government dole -- makes them vastly easier to control that way.  Think about it for just a moment: even if you have OTHER (substantial) sources of income, so that the UBI payment ends up only being say 30% or even just 20% of your monthly income... how long could you survive if that suddenly went missing, or were even just ""held up"" in some bureaucratic snafu?  Step out of line in any of a hundred different ways, and... ""Gee we're sorry, but from the records here, it seems that your UBI payment has been 'temporarily suspended' by administrative order; did you want to begin the process of filing an 'administrative appeal/review'? I can send you the 55 page initial process application form.""  Not to mention that a monthly payment headed your way -- FROM a single centralized government bureaucracy -- is just a really SWEET way for all of the other government entities (states, municipalities, courts, etc) to be able to do things like: make certain you have paid your child support, and your water bill, that any and all traffic citations are paid in full, along with any back parking tickets, possibly any & all civil judgements or fines that might be outstanding against you in some court, perhaps even things like  ""probation fees"" and so on...

lostgeneration,3bavlb,Absinthe99,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:06:55 2015 UTC,"It's the same kind of thing that was pointed out to me years and years ago with the ""prebate"" part of the so called ""Fair"" Tax scheme that was being heavily promoted back then.  Just to clarify, the ""Fair Tax"" was basically a national sales tax (and/or VAT) that would have been imposed on EVERYTHING at an effective rate of (IIRC) something like 30%* -- puportedly to replace all of the other taxes (Federal Income Tax, FICA, etc) -- and then the ""prebate"" was an monthly payment ""rebate"" {but called ""prebate"" because purportedly it would be a month in advance} that would be paid to everyone, under the ostensible concept of rebating them the sales/VAT tax on their basic 'poverty level' necessities.  And what was pointed out to me back then, was that with the amounts that were being posited -- and there's a table here -- it was going to amount to somewhere around 10% to 20% of the total income of most of the population.  Now among the many other problems with the way they had that structured -- note for instance the heavily distorted ""prebate"" amounts;  any ""couple"" getting literally 2x the amount of any single person, and with children, regardless of age/expenses being considered essentially a 1/2 a person -- or the fact that the instant someone turned 18 (or 21) they would begin receiving their own ""adult"" prebate (can you imagine the impact of that on families? Ostensibly the prebates are paid to ""households"" but the only legally legitimate way to pay them would be to each and every ADULT. Ergo Junior or Juniorette turn 18 but still living & eating at home would begin getting a monthly payment in THEIR name, even while Mom & Dad probably still paying nearly all of the bills {and thus most if not all of the taxes that are supposedly being ""prebated""} -- can you say domestic arguments over money? I can, by the way the same problem happens with ""basic income""; not to mention the domestic squabbles between husband & wife, who again, each get their ""separate"" checks if they want, the whole thing is a recipe for domestic conflicts)...  Anyway, among those other problems (and they are NOT trivial) -- having a population where most people have somewhere between 10% to 20% of their income (or even MORE under ""basic income"" possibly 100%) being entirely from the government -- well, if you DON'T think that is fruit that is ""ripe for the picking"" (for any/all government fine or citation purposes, or eventually also for civil-suits & probably even private debt collection {oh yeah they might need to get a ""judgement"" from a court, but it would make the garnishment simple}), then you're VERY naive.  And then there is the obvious fact that -- with so many people being partially if not utterly dependent upon ONE central program of the government -- well, the majority of the population then becomes the equivalent of cattle in a feedlot, dependent upon the farmer for their daily allotment of grain... they're not going to RISK stepping out of line in any major fashion relative to the political sphere, whatever arbitrary rules this ""bread & circuses"" state chooses to impose.  * Even this -- the ""percentage"" of the tax -- the advocates couldn't even be straight-forward about, instead of simply admitting that it would be a 30% sales/vat tax on top of the normal retail price, they had to try to claim that the tax would be ""integrated into"" the price and that it would therefore (i.e. tax as a percentage of total price including tax) only be a 23% tax -- well at least that was the rate that was calculated for the first year (they claimed to not know if it would go up or down in subsequent years)."

The problem of China is that China's entire 'philosophy' boils down to 'China #1.' It has a crude intellectualism to it that would be unfitting for even the most backward Mississippian.   In fact, out of all the nations that call China a superpower, Japan and Korea are the least likely to state that, due to their close exposure with them.   A lot of people don't understand what I mean, and it's because they are Whitebread. Shit, I had a friend from Singapore tell me that the Indonesian term for the Han translates to 'Mountain Ape;' Forest Ape is the term given Orangutans.   The Han are so ethnocentric that they will be stuck in the middle income trap. The nation is incapable of doing any kind of cultural exchange outside its borders, and so all of its corporations cannot function outside the nation.  Again, nobody wants to admit this, but nobody knows any major Chinese brands, because the Chinese have such little experience talking with other cultures.  Another famous saying in East Asia. ""America's best diplomat is China.""  Another famous example. When the Chinese sunk some fishing ships in Vietnam, they then continued with offering a trade delegation the next week. The entire nation was absolutely stunned by that level of autism.  I can go on and on, but the point is that China isn't capable of dealing with other nations, and it will prevent it from being superpower.

The whole SCS issues and Island building. Not to mention giving the world two rogue nuclear powers North Korea and Pakistan.   Some other points I would add are   No one knows the true debt structure of the Chinese economy. Economic numbers coming out of China are untrustworthy (positive or negative data) Corporate Financial Statements (Income/Balance Sheet/Cash Flow) are unreadable. The precipitous drop in the stock market could just be insiders cashing out knowing full well the bogus nature of the financial statements. (We were looking at Chinese acquisitions and their statements made Enron and World-com look legit).  I go back to the Debt structure, I have a feeling Greece would like a tip of a hair pin, when the truth comes out. Recovery and economic revival of the Chinese economy depends on the actual debt levels (not reported). The fact that they dropped their interest rates so steep, tells us that the debt servicing was turning into an economic burden.    We shall wait and see for the true landing, soft or hard.

In 2008 I supported the U.S. bailout cause I knew the writing was on the wall and if something wasn't done we'd be in a second great depression if not worse. That was a mistake. The world is built on dead and discredited ideologies, but the average person has been raised on propaganda and those in power are the very definition of getting a ""man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.""   When the allies met to decide how to handle Germany's inevitable defeat during WWII they concluded unconditional surrender was the only acceptable solution. They couldn't blame backstabbing politicians in their own country when their country is totally overrun. They needed complete failure to see beyond their current world view. That is what's needed in the world economy today. The old capitalism needs to fail totally and completely or it will never change, because there's always those who think just maybe if we tweak it while doing what we always have it will pan out differently. It's a terrible thing to wish for but it's the only way to snap people out of this delusion."

If you hold any hope for a brighter future that's as good as it gets.

lostgeneration,3bbkhv,DJWalnut,4,Sun Jun 28 05:52:48 2015 UTC,"sigh there will never be real change until people see without a doubt that our current economic approach is untenable. What should have happened after the subprime meltdown and bailouts was massive economic reform; that did not occur. The reason it did not occur was because the bailout made the whole situation look manageable and in effect we kicked the can down the road. At this point the only way real positive change can happen is if the current free market ideology completely and totally falls flat on its face. Yes it's totally insane and disgusting and yes it will come with needless suffering but that is the pathetic state of affairs in which we find ourselves. I just happen to have the capacity to articulate it, but the world does not operate in such a fashion.  The new deal only occurred to stave off a socialist revolt and that was almost overthrown by a reactionary conspiracy of capitalists. We americans have been fortuitously insulated from the sadly necessary violent revolution that has been the cornerstone of social progress. I don't advocate it as a means of any resort, but the processes and social circumstance typically necessitate it for substantive change as a matter of historical fact, regardless of how you feel; see the french revolution or the american revolution for example. You want real horror? Imagine the peasants who rose up against a knight, raped his wife, and then forced her to dine upon the flesh of her roasted husband. That is the horrendous reality we pretend does not exist.  Let me be totally clear, I don't want any of this, but things will never improve unless something disastrous happens, because people are abso-fucking-lutely STUPID AND SHORT-SIGHTED. If you can't see that by looking at history there is nothing more I can do for you."

In WWI the Germans had just defeated Russia and could now turn all of their attention to fighting the allies, but with the entrance of the U.S. into the conflict the writing was on the wall. To the German people the Treaty of Versailles looked like them holding at least a fighting chance for a ""fair"" conclusion to the war and instead they were ""stabbed in the back."" By necessitating unconditional surrender in WWII the allies put an end to the possibility of future unrest in Germany as there would be no doubt what caused their downfall.   I personally prefer to liken such situations as we need economically to a junkie hitting rock bottom."

Lumping all conspiracy-minded people into AJ fanboys is kinda useless--there are plenty of non-anarcho-capitalists in /r/conspiracy, and plenty of people who realize the situation is way more complex than some group of vampire elites.

The conspiracy scene also tends to be conservative and pro-capitalist which is bizarre because they don't seem to fully grasp the system they're endorsing (tacitly or explicitly).  The ""inventing complex conspiracies while ignoring simple answers"" problem applies to other fields.  For example, what's more likely: widespread industrial pollution due to lax regulations and profit motive or secret chemtrail-spraying airplanes conducting human experiments for ZOG?  What's more likely: the world is meticulously run by a shadowy cabal of evil Jews or are we just seeing emergent behavior from the perverse incentives offered by capitalism?  Don't even get me started on the free energy/HAARP/UFO people...  Overall, conspiracy theorists employ some sort of reverse Occam's Razor technique, where they ignore the simplest answer and instead try to invent convoluted plots which often lack internal consistency."

This tells me, again, you don't really know what you're talking about. A major conspiracy theory is how the modern system of public schooling, 9-5 work days, fiat banking, controlled politics, and mass distraction has been engineered to control the masses.

If there is a profit on the sale, well they just keep that money.

That's roughly what the US worker participation rate looks like from 2007 to now.   The building industry has increasingly responded with new multi-family buildings, the vast majority of which are now intended for renters.   Unless they're talking about luxury apartments, townhouses & condos, I am not seeing this in my area. Almost all new housing construction around me consists of high end units. I have yet to drive past a traditional big multi-unit medium or low market apartment complex under construction. You know, the kind that would have a dozen or more families in one big (usually brick) structure? Because that's realistically what the most demand exists for right now.

The US economy is really weak, and bad people like Alan Greenspan look good when interest rates are low and bubbles/speculative manias cover up the weakness in the economy.  The realtors have a lobbyist group called the NAR, or National Association of Realtors. They tout stupid lines and the newspapers love to requote it as some sort of fact. They hide their new and used salespeople behind trademarked terms like Realtor, and somehow pass them off as some sort of financial adviser (which they aren't.)   Obviously the wealthy already own real estate, and they don't want their property to decline in value, so they fuck over all the young people in this game to try to keep property values up. But the jobs aren't there to support it, and it just sucks money out of the economy that the younger people would use for retirement or consumer spending. Things that are important.

They just believe that somehow America can fix everything. Or even if it's hard for them to believe, it's what they cling to because there simply is nothing else.   The alternative isn't something most people want to ponder, because it's so dire and because there doesn't seem to be a way the average citizen could have a significant effect on anything. We've lost so much of our bargaining power due to superior automation, being watched by the NSA making it harder to band together, and the electoral system pretty effectively neutering us, just to mention some major forces working against us.

The recession affected the European Union during 2000 and 2001 and the United States in 2002 and 2003. The UK, Canada and Australia avoided the recession, while Russia, a nation that did not experience prosperity during the 1990s, in fact began to recover from said situation. [citation needed] Japan's 1990s recession continued. This recession was predicted by economists, because the boom of the 1990s (accompanied by both low inflation and low unemployment) had already ceased in East Asia during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The recession wasn't as significant as either of the two previous worldwide recessions. Some economists in the United States object to characterizing it as a recession since there were no two consecutive quarters of negative growth.

The ability for someone to profit off the backs of others and determine the worth of someone is granting such immense power into the hands of very,veryfew people.   The problem is working people are so conditioned to believe that socialism will make them even more worthless. That ""it will never work"" is a pretty amazing idea they've been pounded into our heads. And whom does it serve? These very same people who are in power.  It can end when people stop idolizing the wealthy and start looking for answers instead hoping the TV will drown the problems out of existence. We're entering crucial times and I think people are more aware than ever before. I hate to say it but sometimes in my most cynical and desperate moments I hope the economic crash happens just to get it over with, but I know that a lot of people are going to suffer.  Social tensions are going to burst sooner or later. . No one can predict when, but if conditions stay the same and escalate I hope there is some sort of unifying moment where people see the common bond between them and realize that society needs to change and that doesn't mean changing the face but changing the structure. We can't just beg and plead for the rich to be nice! We need to change the structure of the system. Workers need to be in control of their own workplace.

It's killing the planet, and it's reducing the average person's life to that of a slave. Work is a means to an end, not an end to itself. Your attitude is a cancer on this planet, and on humanity.  Growth is good, but unending growth for the sake of unending growth? That's a cancer.  We should focus on better distributing what we have before we even think of making more. I think at this point, the end does not justify the means, especially when the end you speak of will likely not be accomplished in our lifetimes, if ever, because, again, this crap isnt environmentally sustainable long term.   Not to mention your attitude is responsible for how much misery in the richest country on earth right now? Structurally, capitalism cannot and will not give jobs to everyone. Never has, never will. Unemployment is the grease that allows the gears to spin. And as such, many millions of people are going to get screwed over no matter what we do, living at the margins of society, scraping to get by. Poverty is no longer a resource problem in the US, we have the resources. It's a distribution problem, and it doesnt matter how rich we get, that wont change until we change our attitudes toward distribution.  How much pain and suffering must humanity endure chasing ever higher living standards while consigning millions to poverty even though we have the ability to end it? How much coercion and alienation in the workplace must we endure, being miserable and hating a large portion of our lives? How many hungry children must we endure because our distribution mechanics suck? How many people must suffer for this progress of yours, which never ever ends to be made? IF we can get there, it's a big iff. Resources are infinite, our ability to extract and use materials is limited, our fuel is limited, and our actions are dramatically affecting earth's climate. THis model might work for maybe a few decades or a century or so more at the most, but we will hit hard limits, if we arent already there (again, the earth couldnt support the entire world living at our level). Growth is nice, but growth has limited, and people shouldnt be forced to endure a crappy system that basically enslaves them and pays them poorly just so we can grow. We have bigger fish to fry."

However, basic income and neo-socialism aren't perhaps the end answer either.  We don't have the resources to end poverty everywhere, nor hunger, nor provide anything close to western living standards either. It will take far greater technology than we have today to do so, and so we should try to attain it.  Also, while basic income is nice, it hurts the economy because it forces employers to undervalue employees in industries where working does occur, since they would face greater tax rates in order to compensate for basic income. I never said unending progress forever and ever, but I don't believe we're anywhere close to the ""end"" of economic progress.

But that's at least decades if not a century or two away.   I like to separate technological progress from ""living standards"" in an economic sense.  The vast majority of people dont contribute to things that bring us forward. They engage in meaningless busy work, like being cashiers, or tellers, or marketers, etc.  Very few people actually INCREASE our standard of living by bringing NEW value to the table. They simply keep the gears turning. Replace those human gears with machines and we can have a society of both technological progress AND less labor.   I dont buy into the philosophy that we should have everyone working just because it pumps up some NUMBER, which is what we're doing now. Max out GDP, GDP, GDP, Stock market, GDP.   Only a few select jobs actually bring society forward, the rest of society just does the grunt work that should be replaced with machines IMO.  Work is a means to an end, not an end in itself. Your attitude of, but if we replace jobs with machines, we can create NEW jobs is just stupid. It's keeping humanity on this stupid treadmill. **** the jobs. We live in a society of jobism. We lack jobs, so we freak out about how we need to create mroe. Because we force people into the uncomfortable paradigm of work or starve.  Focus on actually getting things done in the most efficient, least labor intensive way possible, as opposed to our highly inefficient most labor intensive way, then we can have a better society.  no, instead we act like masochists.

It's like, ""Congratulations!! Your political and/or business decisions have succeeded in leveraging our entire generation up to their eyeballs in debt because you're more concerned with your personal profit than you are with any semblance of adequate social functionality!  That must be simply spectacular for you.  But I wonder what will happen when an entire generation of your children falls off a productivity cliff because they're too stressed trying to keep your social pyramid scheme going to start families or careers of their own.  Where will your productivity come from then?  How will the machine that funds your wealth operate then?""    Bank accounts are just numbers, and without explicit backing, money only has value by implicit social agreement.  If the underlying system continues chasing only activities of false productivity (the kinds of profits that can be privatized, at the expense of other individuals' time and resources, or the kinds of profits that have some even minuscule social benefit), it's going to create a system of employment depressed in social benefit.  When these ruling classes and institutions try to maintain the facade of productivity (despite the capitalist's true goal of extracting all possible productivity from and value created by others via, again, only the most privately profitable activities), it only results in even more unstable contrivances like banks over-leveraging their loans in subtle and duplicitous ways... just like it will result in vested interests over-leveraging people too- the newer, younger generations with wage slavery and monetary debt and sleep debt and stress-related health issues and unsustainability of every sort.

(2) Get to live at home, even if it's a tent in the backyard, in the garage, something.   (3) Get to eat at home, even if it's rice and beans topped with the parents' leftovers.

At my job exactly 2 years ago the pay for a standard day run (10 to 12 hour day) was 700 revenue.  Today that number is 540 and dropping each week.  That's 160x6 each week or almost 900 dollars pre tax income each week.  like a 35 percent pay cut .    And we're still decently compensated compared to a lot of professions around so people who lose their jobs still flood to trucking.  Automated trucks in force is when the levee will break on the working class.  So many families have single income truckers at the head, especially down south and in Appalachia where it's some of the only decent paying work readily available.    It's not just trucking either.  The local gm plant that's opening are starting guys at 15 an hour and those are uaw guys.  They're tracked for cola raises but not much else and the idea of a pension to a lot of the new hires is almost unthinkable.

You can get a DoT physical fairly cheaply and one portion of it is a vision test where they can tell you beforehand if you'd qualify medically to drive or not.  It's kind of a lonely life but you end up working so much you don't really notice it.  Not sure if that's a good thing or bad thing.    Also that 1.2 - 1.5k is pre tax and there are some other expenses (annual inspections, oil changes, non-warrantied maintenance) that can also come out of it, but generally averages less than $100/wk on additional truck stuff.    edit:  Also, most box places usually have loading /unloading included in the line haul or most large places have lumpers on hand to handle the loading and unloading.

There are essentially two political tribes in the US, and your affiliation with one or the other depends more on cultural/emotional identification than on careful analysis of the issues or a candidate's personal magnetism.  Bernie probably wouldn't scare off most people who would have voted for Hilary anyway, and Hilary probably wouldn't be able to scoop up many people who wouldn't vote for Bernie.  Like 2008, 2016 will be largely decided by voter turnout.  Democrats should have a demographic advantage... they just need somebody who can get people motivated enough to get off their asses and vote.

lostgeneration,3az9ve,GuruOfReason,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:16:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know which operating system you use.  But if you use Windows, then Microsoft provides a free Visual Studio edition for download.  Actually, NOW (believe it or not) you can get a scaled down version of Visual Studio for Linux and Mac.  Regardless of the OS, I believe it is a good idea to download VS simply because it is a good way to learn C#, and that is very popular right now.    Also, I would recommend Java because it is comparable in popularity with C#.  If you learn C#, then Java will be easy to learn simply because it seems like C# with less features.  Unlike the Microsoft stack, Java is cross-platform and (like .NET) based upon a virtual machine, so a piece of code is supposed to work on all platforms.    However, Microsoft is now getting into Linux, so not too long from now, you will likely be able to get Linux (and Mac) jobs developing on the Microsoft stack (Yes, hell has frozen over).  So if you want to maximize your value and chances of getting a job, then this is something to prepare for.    Another thing to mention is that so far, the .NET culture/ecosystem seems more narrow in scope than the Java one.  By this, I mean that if you go for .NET (whether you choose C# or VB.NET) then you will most likely get an ASP.NET/MVC job, working with SQL Server to write business applications used by employees of the company that you work at.  That itself lets you know where to place your focus if you are going into the .NET world.  But going the web development route requires you to also know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and several other technologies.  So, it might be good to learn WinForms at first.  In fact, WinForms will likely be taught to you as you learn C#.  And you can get a job based upon that.  Build some applications for whatever bullshit reasons you want, and include the binary executables and the source codes in your portfolio.  The only thing it needs to do is to prove that you know the language(s), and are able to build applications with it.    I know that sounds really heavy, but it really isn't as much as it looks, simply because once you learn one language, then learning another is simply recycling knowledge to work with slightly different syntax and rules.  Some languages are radically different.  But for the most part, you will encounter similar rules.  Java, again, is similar (note: Java and JavaScript are completely unrelated languages) to .NET.  However, you get a lot more variety in the Java ecosystem.  There are still a lot of web app jobs, but you have a greater chance of escaping the business-oriented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web app development model.  Plus, if you want to be a  Android developer, then you need to know Java.    That's it for Part 1."

lostgeneration,3az9ve,GuruOfReason,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:18:37 2015 UTC,"In addition to that, learn HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, XML, and SQL (pronunciation ""sequel"").  If you want to go for Linux or another UNIX clone, learn PHP and Bash too.  For the most part, these will be supplementary languages, but JavaScript is starting to emerge as a language in its own right, and the Node.js and AngularJS libraries/frameworks, among others, are hot right now in the industry.  HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript are front-end technologies.  Basically, they are basically the UI component of web applications.  SQL is the language used to exchange data to/from the database, and is the back-end of the application.  C# and Java are typically the middle tier, and contains the Business Rules (yes, that's a term) which govern much of the application's behavior.    The easiest to start with is HTML.  Build a working website.  Then learn how to style it with CSS.  Then add more interactivity by adding JavaScript.  Add a database too, and use SQL to add and remove the records used by the website.  Now, you have a full blown web application.  Learn XML and JSON too.  You won't have quite a use for it yet, though.  Since XML looks like HTML, learn this before learning JSON.    Now, about that SQL.  You can download a freeware version of SQL Server.  If you go the Microsoft route, then you will be using SQL Server.  If you go the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP) route, then learn MySQL, MariaDB (which was recently forked from MySQL), and PostgreSQL.  Postgres should be a lower priority to learn, and is harder than MySQL, but Postgres is in demand.  The other SQL flavors are very corporate, so you will likely not get hands on experience with Oracle, DB2, Informix, or other systems until you break into the industry.    While most database systems use SQL (those that don't are not even worth mentioning because NoSQL databases are rare; so don't waste your time right now with those) each has its own spin, or slight variation of the language.  For the most part, those platform differences aren't worth THAT much if you are looking for a job, unless they specifically say SQL Server, or MySQL or something.  If you are working for a Microsoft stack job, then of course learn things specific to SQL Server (which I would recommend regardless since so many jobs want SQL Server), and if you are searching for Linux, then learn MySQL specific things.  Read about PL/SQL and others on the internet too, although you won't be playing with it until you are working at some decently sized company.    And then there is debugging.  Research debugging techniques because the less bugs/errors there are in the application, the more impressed hirers will be.  Visual Studio makes it easy (well, at least the Windows ones, I don't have a lot of Linux .NET experience yet).  There are other languages such as C++, Python, Ruby, Pascal/Delphi, and COBOL.  These can be used to get a job too.  C++ is hard, so try for this once C# or Java become easy.  You won't be developing web apps using C++.  It's usage in other areas, however, is widespread.  If you want to break into the game industry, for instance, then you need to master C++.  C++ has a higher learning curve, so if your task is finding a job ASAP, then skip this.  Python and Ruby are great languages to learn and to make money with, but I don't have as much experience with those languages.  I know Pascal/Delphi really well, but those jobs are rare.  I haven't been able to snag a Delphi job, so I don't know how easy it is to get one.  That might be one area in which there are just enough jobs for the 6 or so Delphi programmers that exist in the US.  COBOL is also a rare skill, and is in high demand.  Programming in COBOL probably sucks, but you will get paid very well if you learn this.  This is an old people language...this IS your grandfather's programming language.  Most COBOL programmers are old, retired, or dead.  So this is a good skill to have.    This is the end of part 2. Part 3 is coming."

I am going to assume that you are using Windows.  If so, then your work is cut out for you.  Learn HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, XML, C# (and VB.NET too.  C# and VB.NET are essentially the same language with different syntax), and SQL (with an emphasis on SQL Server).    So, the first thing to do then is download and install Visual Studio Express and SQL Server Express.  Once you do that, start hacking.  Microsoft provides extensive documentation of their tools, and MSDN is a good place to start learning C# (and programming in Microsoft technologies).  You can learn the basics of HTML, CSS, XML, and SQL at W3Schools.  I highly recommend that resource to teach you the basics of web development.  Of course, frequent the programming subs.  Start with /r/programming and /r/learnprogramming.  Those are massive resources in themselves.  The individual language subs (such as /r/csharp) usually have good tutorials. Stackoverflow.com is another great resource.  Use Git to host your projects, and see if you can make changes to some open source code that are in Git repositories.  Buy a lot of programming books.  That is expensive (like $50/book), so you would be better off just torrenting the books, at least until you can afford it.    Or, simply Google it.  Googling is probably the greatest resource you will have.  Basically, if you want to learn programming, just google that shit.  I'm not trying to be a smart ass with that remark.  That is really what you will be doing a lot of, regardless of where you are in your career or what your skill level is.  Learning google-fu (advanced google by using elaborate search strings) itself is an exercise that will help with your programming, for a variety of reasons.   When you start off, you will start off with a Hello World program.  All it does is show ""Hello World"" on the screen.  Once you have reached this point, it becomes a matter of reading reference material and practicing with what you have learned.  You will do a lot of console (read DOS or command prompt) programming at first, and then you will move to GUI elements.  You will be amazed at your first working Windows application (whatever its purpose is).  It is really not a large leap from a Hello World application in DOS to something that is recognizable as a Windows application, that is, unless you decided on using C++ to build a Windows application (yes, that is really difficult and tedious...which is exactly why .NET (and both C# and VB.NET) exists).  Of course, C++ is great to learn, and I would recommend that you learn it.  But for the purposes of getting a job NOW, that can be skipped for now.     If you need my advice, then look me up."

Then you're going to go through 4 years learning even more stuff, and this is so you can go play on a cruise ship or teach high schoolers.

Understanding various libraries employed, design strategies, databases, etc will be more useful to you and just takes time. Learning from codeacademy is just as useful in this regard.  That being said. The USEFUL bootcamps are ones that are specifically oriented to software QA. These jobs get a bad rap for stupid reasons. But Software Developers in Test are becoming very very useful in development teams. QA jobs start around $55k/year and have their own advancement paths (SDET, Business Analyst QA, QA Lead, QA Manager, etc)  In addition to that, major companies do sponsor QA bootcamps (as in, sponsor the companies that provide these services) and hire directly from them.

Of the 465 companies with published reviews recently surveyed using Great Place to Work's Trust Index employee survey, 315 of them surveyed at least 50 employees under age 35. Nearly 90,000 millennial-aged employees from these companies answered 58 questions about how frequently they experience the behaviors that create a great workplace. This resulted in a total score for each company based entirely upon employee feedback.  Great Place to Work’s 2015 list of the 100 Best Workplaces for Millennials was ranked using these scores.   The Millennials list is the latest in a series of workplace lists determined by Great Place to Work, the workplace culture consulting and research firm that conducts the most thorough surveys of employment practices in corporate America.  The firm’s employer review database contains information about the hiring, perks, benefits, and work practices of more than 400 companies.

I've been at my first out-of-college job now for 3 months. I studied marketing. While I enjoyed college as a social experience, and while I definitely did learn a lot of things, little to none of what I learned has to do with my current job. It has to do with marketing, which is the area I work in, but not my actual role. And my specific job/role within marketing/advertising was never mentioned in any class or textbook that I took or had. A lot of what I'm doing is learn-as-you-go-along and learn-by-trial-and-error. In fact, many people I work with and who are successful in my area didn't even study marketing or advertising or even communications. Some studied Sociology, or Psychology for example.   I think being able to finish college and having a degree is telling employers that you are able to juggle large workloads, among other things. It's not really about what I studied (aside from STEM majors), but rather that I was able to survive 4 years of terrible, coinciding group projects, worse professors, and a system that would do whatever it took to prevent me from graduating on time (e.g. you need 5 more unnecessary classes that have nothing to do with your major). So while I do think college is necessary for a lot of majors, it does not currently represent a good value overall. I work my ass off for 4 years for a piece of paper which no employer will even ask to see. I pay out the ass every semester for classes that have nothing to do with what I'm studying, but which I'm required to take. And let's not forget the $150+ textbooks which we'll open only once or twice for many classes."

The unemployment rate for recent grads with bachelor's degrees is somewhere between 8 and 12 percent depending on the source.  Underemployment stats are kind of fuzzy since they're based on a Dept. of Labor survey that asked whether people feel that a degree is required for their job.

The way you put it makes it sound like 75% of students are doomed, which isn't really the case... although the current situation is bad, it's not quite that bad.

And that's exactly the problem. keep looking for the needle in the haystack.  Again and again, year after year, my successful, gorgeous, and amazing friends remain kiss-less on New Year’s Eve. And on Valentine’s Day. And on the 4th of July.  Not really our problem, not like it should matter anyways, I was always told I have to be comfortable with myself before adding a partner to the mix. This does seem a bit insecure, men don't like insecurity anymore than women do.   ...And by what standard are they successful? I don't care if you make six figures or work at starbucks (as long as there's no monetary stress/debt) If they're a pain in the ass or crazy it really doesn't matter how 'successful' they are. I see red flags, I'm gone. Don't hide it, I will figure and find it out.  The only dateable men we encounter are either attached, gay, or otherwise involved in “it’s complicated” situations.  There's that 'dateable' again. And... no, they are not. I'd suggest looking up mgtow...  We are ball-busters or fairy-tale dreamers.  With the way this is going it sure seems like it.  but we do have certain non-negotiable expectations for potential mates that include college degrees and white-collar jobs.  And watch as those ""non-negotiable expectations"" slowly dissipate over time. I'd also like to note, not only are you picky with careers and education, but let me guess, with pay as well? What wrong with the electrician or the union workers? Not ""good enough"" for you? You're only hurting your chances and I wouldn't even bother with the trouble. Not like I care, attitudes like this are far too common. It doesn't matter, as a millennial working class (hopeful) writer I'm already excluded.   This unwillingness to settle for less than we think we deserve  There's a word for this... I hate it with a fiery hot passion... But it explains it perfectly... ""entitlement""  the majority of Millennial women have long assumed we would meet Prince Charming via friends, or through their own social circles.  We men have known since we're thrown into the mix, dating is hard.  Prince Charming  We are ball-busters or fairy-tale dreamers.  At least try to maintain a level of consistency.  that’s why so many people are into online dating, because you can pick and choose character traits — and that makes people wary about settling down, especially when, in a city like New York, there are so many options.  Look up 'The Paradox of Choice' this isn't necessarily a good thing. you know what my parents called me as a picky eating child? A pain in the ass. (Ok. I stole that from Carlin, but my parents agree so who cares.)  Millennial women have taken it for granted that they will pair up with equal partners. But increasingly, there aren’t enough of these men to go around.  smh we're right fucking here. there is a noticeable dip in the amount of men going into secondary education, but here we have the dilemma of these woman being completely unwilling to trade down, even marginally or temporarily.  Women now outnumber men on college campuses  probably should read ahead, but whatever, this does effect their arbitrary standards.  “There needs to be a cognitive behavior change in what are [considered] important traits,” says Mundy. “I talk to so many women who are obsessed with finding men on their level.  I'm not really counting on it.  They want someone as ambitious, engaged, and high-achieving as they are.  All girlspeak for $$$  They maybe need to rethink that to seek a partner who is supportive, rather than competitive.  Isn't this what a relationship should be in the first place?  They have this list of qualities (smart, has a job, knows something about culture or the world  And this is why so many men go after dumb women.  I’d personally rather be single than in a relationship with someone who isn’t worth it.  And this I agree with, but it does the author no favors.  So here's the issue, they (the author I assume) want an ubermensch dating partner who's caring, tough, rich, smart and educated, cultured, white collar worker, etc, they feel like they have all the time in the world and they barely put any work into it.  This is a recipe for FAILURE. Don't be this woman, or girl I should say."

I mean, I subscribe to Sartre's line of thinking that there is NO definite human nature, so I can understand why people with power feel they have the moral high ground (might makes right, ""I'm successful so I must be doing it right""), while people without power feel they have the moral high ground (right makes might,"" I'm working twice as hard as the rich, their dialogue must be full of shit"").   Justice and equality aren't the same thing, and both should try to be upheld if we as a species want to achieve our highest potential. But I can honestly say, that it is both unjust and unequal (thus, bad, I guess?) to willfully ignore the struggle of an entire class and dismiss it as laziness, while having more vacation days, less hours, and far more connections. Of course a CEO should make more money than their secretary, but the secretary shouldn't be belittled for not being CEO.   I'm not saying that every rich person is evil or every poor person is hard working, that's where justice comes in. What I am saying is that this country needs to sit down and rethink morality in the modern world, sans protestant work ethic, sans agricultural based calendar, sans entitlement (which is very clearly a huge facet of the 1% ideology), and focus on leaning more towards rewarding those that work hard, and trying to give those less fortunate more chances to succeed.

It will not be easy, change never is, but it is necessary if we want to take back the prosperity, and in a broader sense, ""freedom"" (both financially and socially) that was promised to us.

This is a demographic that wouldn't even qualify for a $300 payday loan at 5,000%+ interest rates if it wasn't for the government backing these loans.

A lot of people with a little bit of money got smart and secured themselves nice rent-controlled apartments a few years back and now use AirBNB and VRBO to turn them into mini-hotels. So now the limited housing stock that's available is being used for tourists instead of residents. This drives up rents, creates issues with long-term tenants who now are next to a hotel room where the residents are loud, disruptive, and then the security/privacy concerns. Screw AirBNB."

AirBNB increases that volume and velocity by allowing one night stays. The type of visitors you get is really different in one day vs one month.  I think it's fair to allow some type of short-term subletting but it's a balancing act. I just don't think it's fair to the other residents in the building to have to deal with the externalities (noise, security, driving up rents) and other real costs (paying for trash/water/building maintenance) just so some jackass can make a few extra bucks."

Private companies around the world could literally turn around and sue the US government for lost profits due to failing to open the bids up to international bidding as mandated by the trade agreement.

There are a few outliers in the Nordic areas, but when you get to France, Spain, and Italy this is more the case. American except to have bigger places and then to fill them they need more stuff. Also, Europeans have less of a need for cars, which takes a huge chunk out of anyone's budget.

I'm ahead on my student loan payments, have a really good 401k started up, and even have a decent savings built up - all without living on a shoestring budget.  There are jobs out there - maybe not where you want them to be - but they're out there. Everything is a compromise."
lostgeneration,3amhnw,pomjuice,8,Mon Jun 22 13:27:54 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're talking housing then look at places like:   Eugene, Oregon  Tuscon, Arizona  Springfield, Ohio  Colorado Springs, Colorado (decent economy and can still find houses in decent areas for 150k)   Maybe Davenport, Iowa  I have been looking around at buying a house since I've saved enough money. I can't afford anything in a major metropolitan area, so I've been looking at places with some tech industry and/or education since I have experience in those. What I've found is that while properties in and around major cities are overpriced, a lot of places have remained relatively cheap.   It just depends on what type of place you want to live and what job s you're willing to take."
lostgeneration,3amhnw,manliest_destiny,7,Sun Jun 21 22:53:54 2015 UTC,"Those are all moderate sized cities (except maybe Davenport, Iowa, never heard of it so I don't know), not small towns. Not every major population center is a megacity like New York or Miami."

A lot of that southwest PA / eastern Ohio / northwest WV area was a proverbial wasteland from the point of view of Americans from other regions.  You can't really get worse than rock bottom though.  The '08 recession didn't hit here nearly as hard as other communities in the country because there wasn't much to hit.  Now the area is improving steadily, and not just Pittsburgh proper, but a lot of the region.  Most of my buddies live in Beaver County, which is north/west of Pittsburgh along the Ohio River. You can still get good houses there for under 100k easily, and you're only a 40 minute drive to the heart of downtown.  But Pittsburgh isn't really a good measure of the rest of the country.  Our relative well-being can only be compared to other regions that were already depressed before '08.  There aren't a lot of those of the same size and scale as Pittsburgh.  Cincinnati?  Louisville?

They just sat in bars in charleroi and connellsville and uniontown and talked about the stillers and the good ol' days.   I graduated high school in 02 and went to college in the area. Bought a house and got married while still a senior in college in 06. I had been making ~20k per year since I was a sophomore in high school straight through college. Worked for the company that owned the company I worked for in school... Now I have a farm out in the sticks. Easy breazy.

What do you think happens when another 100k people move there with no jobs, or jobs they have to drive for hours to get to?  Thinking positively isn't going to change economic reality.

Probably not on any significant level. Neither can I. But you have food, internet, shelter, and you can attempt to make the best of it. If you want to fight the system and hope to rectify what you perceive as the ills of society, then go for it, but at least do it with a smile.   And life is exactly a feel good game. If you want to feel good then you will, whether you have all the things people tell you need or not.

Scotland has chosen the opposite of what we got in the UK election a right wing government.  The hunger for a real left wing alternative is alive in the rest of the UK but there is no party to fill the gap south of the border.

The question isn't ""are they more likely to be attacked or an attacker"" so much as ""are they disproportionately represented among the people who do wind up as an attacker?"" and when it comes to mass shootings, the answer is an emphatic yes. We're talking 90% mentally ill people, 10% ideological terrorists here. And probably half of that 10% is batshit insane, too, with the really terrifying ones being guys like Anders Breivik who, as far as anyone can tell, actually is perfectly sane.  Does it mean we need to be giving every person with a mental illness the stinkeye? No. But it does mean we need to do a better job of identifying such illness and getting people help. So many of these killings could have been prevented if somebody had just noticed that the poor bullied kid was also a budding paranoid schizophrenic. Pretending that mental illness isn't a factor in the hopes that it will help lower the stigma on mental illness is completely counterproductive. The entire problem is it's so stigmatized that people don't tend to get treatment for it.

Definitions for the economic characteristics underlying the three broader measures of labor underutilization are worth mentioning here. Discouraged workers (U-4, U-5, and U-6 measures) are persons who are not in the labor force, want and are available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They are not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the prior 4 weeks, for the specific reason that they believed no jobs were available for them. The marginally attached (U-5 and U-6 measures) are a group that includes discouraged workers. The criteria for the marginally attached are the same as for discouraged workers, with the exception that any reason could have been cited for the lack of job search in the prior 4 weeks. Persons employed part time for economic reasons (U-6 measure) are those working less than 35 hours per week who want to work full time, are available to do so, and gave an economic reason (their hours had been cut back or they were unable to find a full-time job) for working part time. These individuals are sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers.   http://www.bls.gov/lau/stalt.htm"

It is a revival of a hairstyle that was very popular in the 1920s and 1930s.   Its reemergence may have something to do with the critically acclaimed series Boardwalk Empire and Peaky Blinders, both of which are set in the interwar period.

Kodak didn't fall off the face of the earth, it fragmented along the years into many small companies that are profitable and thriving, but since they don't have the big yellow box on the label they go unnoticed. Paychex headquarters is in one of the suburbs, as is Constellation brands (one of the 3 largest alcoholic beverage companies on the planet or something to that effect. GM still has a presence in their Rochester Products (though the name and ownership have changed multiple times), There are still a disproportionate number of machine shops in the area as I understand it, as well as many smaller companies that make up any metropolitan area  Part of why we get such a bad rap is that the city had it SO GODDAMN GOOD for so long with Kodak, Xerox, and Bouch and Lomb all being headquartered and employing very large blue collar workforce, as well as a large white collar engineering contingent. My mother and uncle can't go one family visit without waxing poetic about what the downtown shopping district was like come Christmas bonus time. As the gears of time and globalization, coupled with corporate arrogance on a massive scale (Kodak created the digital camera, Xerox failed to capitalize on their contributions to personal computing) and the blue collar jobs that helped stabilize the city's demographics dried up. Many of the white collar jobs went away as well, but see my above comment about fragmentation.  Another weird part of it is how the City of Rochester is legally and statistically defined, and how everyone that lives in the area sees it. The city proper has the overwhelming concentration of poverty in the metropolitan area. When the race riot happened in 1965 it really sped along an already growing white flight movement to the ring of suburban towns that make up the rest of Monroe county. There are sections that the old money used to live in that never went bad, but there is a ""fatal crescent"" that goes from E. Main street north and west until it loops back to the river.

But what he --and many contemporary white-collars --believe is that they've earned the entirety of their salaries.   Since the dawn of the industrial revolution, countless industries have spawned from nothingness. Their ultimate usefulness is near nought. The beauty is getting people to believe they need something. People at the top of these industries often cite their own hard work as the reason for their success. But that's a crock. Their minds are important but the hard work of the teams they assemble is the most many of them can realistically take credit for. Past that, it's simply the necessity of the working man wage that gets the job done, and has always been that way. I'm not going to devalue creativity or innovation. But without manpower even the pyramids wouldn't have been built.   What Boomers don't see today is that kind of ethic by blue collar workers. That's because THEY SHIPPED ALL THOSE FUCKING JOBS OVERSEAS for sake of higher profit margins and stock prices.  The gutted the greatest thing this nation had -- people willing to keep their heads down and work hard for a higher standard of living -- for sake of their own meaningless empires.   None of them are truly great thinkers or businessmen. None are Rockefellers, Carnegies, Fords or Edisons. At best we have had Jobs and Musk in this country over the last 10 years, and the latter isn't even from here.

It played out for the best, ultimately, but not before Tesla was let go and ultimately died penniless. Rockefeller and Carnegie were involved in a battle of egos throughout much of their careers. Truthfully, the progress these two giants made would not have been as great without the other, going so far as building massive structures in NY to their own name and ""oneupsmanship"" through Christmas and birthday gifts.  I've heard mixed reports on Musk, but I couldn't care less. He's got the most innovative ideas in the world, and although things like his rail system aren't grounded in reality, his plans for electricity and interplanetary travel are. He also seems to have his head on straight about potential complications of A.I. ... so he's either a genius deserving of reward or the best Bond villain of all time.  Showmanship.

It incorporates the massive and unspoken mental health issue plaguing not only the U.S. but many western countries.  Go to /r/suicidewatch and read a few entries. There are some pretty clear patterns once you start looking. Unemployed or underemployed young people - more often than not coming from broken homes and/or parents who either don't know or don't care how to raise their offspring.   There's a generation of people 'lost' in more ways than just financially. While this in no way justifies violence, we need to realize that the effects of income inequality go beyond limiting bank accounts and fiscal opportunities. It gives rise to a truly miserable and misguided people whose values and perceptions can be warped to the point where they react with hatred, fear and violence."

His environment was clearly one of racial hatred and social inequality. That itself does not exist in a bubble and is a product of larger factors. Nothing exists independent of anything else.  These killings are horrible and reprehensible but they're just the latest in a series of increasingly-urgent wake up calls that there are broader factors in play, at the national level, which ultimately manifest in such concentrations of hate and suffering.  Pointing a judgemental finger at this one killer is fine and dandy, but no amount of vitriol directed at him will address the underlying problems, much less stop the Next one, or the next.   America needs to take a big step back and address its very real problems. Until then, this will just keep happening, no matter how much judgement you may heap on an individual."

I disagree with the implication that racism and mental illness are somehow related. Both have environmental determinants, but racism is an ideology that people choose to uphold (especially in its current state, which emphasises opposition to 'degenerate' mainstream society). By contrast, one of the defining features of the various dysfunctions falling under the label of mental illness is their compulsive, uncontrollable nature, and the great difficulty people have in choosing to act otherwise.   I have every sympathy for members of the working class whose jobs and living standards have been displaced by mass immigration and outsourcing, and understand why they might feel resentful and suspicious of recent immigrants. To be honest, I'm pessimistic that the left can resolve the seemingly contradictory imperatives for freedom of movement and workers' rights.   But working-class people aren't just empty vessels waiting to be infected by the 'virus' of racism. All our decisions are bounded by the environment in which we live, but we still choose how to conceptualise our situation, who (if anyone) to blame, and what to do about it. Sometimes these choices deserve praise, sometimes they deserve condemnation."

The fact is that unions are being gutted and with it any of the labor laws that made this nation what it was for the last 100 years. When labor becomes too expensive, it's time to move it. It'll happen to your county too. And it might not move to another town. It might move to another state. Or nation. Or eventually planet. Regardless, people that are supposed to be part of a system are being squeezed out of it.

Although everyone will be paying the same percentage, an unfair burden is placed on individuals with low incomes.   Lets pretend the value $X is the amount of money it takes to get by comfortably in America. Under this amount you can cover food, housing, utilities, your dependent's needs, transportation, and some sort of savings. Regardless of your income, this amount is what it will take to live comfortably, even if you are normally used to living with more.  So here are two scenarios:  if you are making $60K, you're situation will look like this under his plan.  ($60K x 0.855) - $X = Y  And if you are making $500K, you're situation will look like this:  ($500K x 0.855) - $X = Z  at this point, every dollar left in scenario Y has more value to the individual than the dollars left in scenario Z. Every dollar in Y is expected to do more bang for its buck in scenario Y than scenario Z. Sure, Z needs to also pay for their huge mortgage, child's college education, a few cars and dinners out for a couple days a week, but those are all choices.  When you are in scenario Y, you have very little choices about what you should do with the remainder of your income. You should save it but you need to pay for an unexpected medical bill. You should use it to pay for utilities that are higher then expected, but your car got towed and they need $120 from you to get it back.  Life happens, unexpectedly, and that burden is heavier when you are have much less to work with, and when it isn't a choice about how you are gonna spend it, its gonna be a bad time.  Lastly, income can be seen as a bell curve with the mean at $52K. That means everyone under $50K, according to this plan, will not be taxed (I read that correctly, right?). So that means someone who makes $49,999.99 a year will have the same disposable income as someone who makes $58,479.52 (because $49,999 / 0.855 = $58K). That is a $10K difference in salary but living under the same conditions. And this will be the situation a ton of Americans, and a ton of votes, will be under since $50K-$58K includes the mean of $52K.  This is why flat taxes have never worked."

lostgeneration,3aatv3,aaronkyle_,8,Thu Jun 18 16:28:43 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call any degree ""useless""... any degree can be useful if you know how to make yourself marketable.    In some fields, marketability comes from professional connections and research/internship opportunities, so you have to do a lot of research and make sure you select the right school that's big enough/prestigious enough/specialized enough to give you access to the opportunities you'll need.  Examples include business, archaeology, international studies, law.  In some fields, marketability comes from producing a body of work, and a degree in that field may be less important.  If you're interested in that kind of field, consider majoring in something else to give yourself broader experiences while you're working on your body of work.  Examples include art, computer science, English.  In some fields, marketability comes from being seen as ""certified"" to perform a job.  A degree is very important for these jobs, but experience counts, too.  Since everyone else in the field will have similar credentials, anything you can do to set yourself apart will help.  Examples include science, education, nursing, engineering.  In some fields, marketability requires more than a bachelor's degree, so you'd better plan on grad school from the beginning.  Examples include psychology, medicine, language/linguistics.  In some fields, marketability comes from having an additional area of specialization in a different field and being able to draw connections between them.  You need to be marketable in the other field, too.  Examples include philosophy, communications, social science."

My best takeaway from studying Psychology:  People are morons and will readily believe just about anything.  I learned some hard life lessons through higher education and I'm now debating whether I should finish said degree (2 semesters left if I return).  I should have went into software engineering, but chose to go to a state university 15 minutes from home so I could pay for school primarily out of pocket.  At least I only have ~$7,000 in debt for 3 years of college for Psych BA.  But the shit I get from others for my field pisses me off.  I was the first of the family to go to college and was told by everyone just do what interest you (pre 2008).  I chose Psych because human behavior interested me; I did what I was advised to do at 18 and those same advisors said I should take out a loan.  I was a guinea pig for my family and for society.  And now we get mocked for studying Psych.  My 19 year old sister even mocked my choice to study Psych (and note that it was me that warned her of college consequences and pushed her to go into software engineering after what I was awakening to).    I'm now focused in working in aviation.  I have 2 years experience at an aviation maintenance facility and my dad has worked for a commercial airlines for 30 years. I'm using nepotism to my full advantage; fuck anyone who thinks it's unfair.  Once I break through and start working for that same company I know contentment will follow.  He gets 5 weeks paid vacation a year and flies for free so I'll spend my life traveling the world.  And if ever commercial aviation falls to some new form of transportation, I'll migrate to that.  School was fun and I would argue I have had $7,000 worth of experiences, but I am so lucky I at least played it smart financially and just went to the closest school while living with my parents.  By all means though, help kids stay away from stupid loans for a Psych degree."

I'm not quite sure how to articulate it, but I'm pretty certain all those things are related.  Like, what if part of the motivation to amass wealth is out of a extreme desire for control and power born out of a sense of fear of being powerless? So, your self-preservation instinct is informing your desires to do whatever it takes to get into a position where you never have to worry about being powerless or out of control.  So the moment everything goes to shit, you go into hiding. You wallow in your own excrement and eat mushrooms while trying to stay sane with your relatives. It's shitty and awful, but you're alive. That survival instinct is satisfied because you're surviving. But when it comes time to peek out of the bunker and maybe looking at re-emerging into the world, I'm sure that part of their minds will say, ""Don't do it! It's a trap! Stay in here where it's safe!

lostgeneration,3a5tiu,avengingturnip,7,Thu Jun 18 19:44:09 2015 UTC,"Is this just blaming the victim?   No, it's not, because the monarchies of Europe were not going to let the French set a precedent of overthrowing monarchies. It was going to end in war, no matter what the French did.   The French revolution ended with the ascension of the monster Napoleon and a continent wide war.   Napoleon was no worse than any of the other military leaders and monarchs of the time when it came to brutality, and, as I said, the French Revolution would have resulted in war because it set a dangerous precedent for conservative European monarchies, whether or not Napoleon ever took power.

lostgeneration,3a5tiu,reginaldaugustus,0,Thu Jun 18 01:41:43 2015 UTC,"/u/avengingturnip nailed it.  After the fall of Napoleon, the monarchy was the only institution capable of commanding any sort of legislative authority. That's why it was resurrected by the Bourbon Restoration.   Monarchies are sanctioned by the authority of the clergy. The clergy is theoretically subordinate to an ethical ideal.   The credibility of Bourbon monarchism was derived by the symbology of regency, which is tantamount to an approbation of ethical idealism.  The degeneracy of the papacy was effectively demolished by the French Revolution. This was necessary. However, the destruction of sacerdotal corruption was inevitably accompanied by the violation of the ethical ideal. Revolutionary chaos was thereby engendered by the antireligious agitations of the encyclopedists.   As it has been demonstrated, scientism, socialism, and libertarianism, (which are all subsidiaries of ""liberté, égalité, fraternité), are qualitatively amoral. Amorality has its benefits, i.e. as in the aforementioned destruction of priestly decadence. But, taken to its extreme, it inevitably results in social disorder, since libertarian or socialist elites are free to pursue wealth by any means necessary.   Tranquility, equanimity, and justice are only actualized by an authority that is itself subject to an ethical ideal. Historically, this ideal was interpreted religiously. Theoretically, it could also be interpreted metaphysically."

lostgeneration,3a5wps,Gstreetshit,2,Wed Jun 17 16:16:56 2015 UTC,"The study cited looks at a very narrow range of industries, most of which receive very high government subsidies.    I'm not sure how they're calculating effective tax rate, either, since the rate can be extremely variable over multiple quarters... for instance, Ford had an effective tax rate of 30% in one quarter and 2% in another, for an average of 15% over the course of several years."
lostgeneration,3a5wps,shinkouhyou,-1,Wed Jun 17 17:35:51 2015 UTC,"You are worried about Ford and Apple and Microsoft.  Those are places that are extremely rare in the business world, are multi national, and have millions of dollars to spend on getting around a ""progressive"" tax system.   The vast majority of corporations are small businesses with 500 employees or less. These are the companies that employ the vast majority of Americans, and the ones that increasing taxes screw over the most. You would trade off being able to screw over apple with increasing unemployment, lower wages, higher cost.  So if you raise the tax rate the corporation MAY pay a little bit more in tax, but wages will be suppressed, and cost will go up to the consumer. Their profit margin is going to be made one way or another. Then if they can't maintain the profits they want, they will just close up shop and go to Ireland or something similar."

The CFR went from 68 volumes in the 60s, to 235 volumes today. Literally hundreds of thousands of pages on the federal registrar. Yet somehow since Reagan and Clinton rolled back a few on some very specific industries that means less?  Wages will tend to stagnate when you have 235 volumes of red tape on how you MUST conduct business,  and double the amount of people in the available workforce.   Wages started stagnating in the mid 70s. At that time there were 25 million women in the workforce. Now there are 70 million women plus 30 million illegal immigrants, we added a hundred million people to the workforce. This doesn't even take into account places like China, Japan, Taiwan, and various south east Asian countries which started to industrialize in that time period."

And true, I can also see the point of view that holds that a minimum wage job can lead to something better. But the very fact that we're tolerating work that isn't edifying is, frankly, a symptom of a society in decline.  We should be expect that every job pushes us to reach our full potential, and that all work is meaningful and contributory to our future selves and society.  But this society isn't functional. And that includes the group of people who so readily pull the ""OMG U R SO ENTITLED"" canard.  Anyway OP, best of luck to you. I'd try to find a job that best fits your talents or perhaps entices you towards reaching a goal. As long as you can squeeze by, be selective.

Now down the line with everything going to crap they try to sell the second house to pay for bills or debts or whatever(their broke). But they can't because its not legal. Its supposed to be a shed.

Ironically,  despite the aweful looking neighborhoods, they're still pretty expensive.   Minimum wage is higher there, but cost of living easily negates any gains."

Homelessness might be a less horrible temporary option if it weren't illegal most places to go to sleep in public. Wind up in debt from a ticket or a criminal record, good luck with improving your situation. So maybe you are without work or enough work, and you find you don't have rent anymore...instead of living in your car for a month and stopping the debt cycle, you either have to burden one of your relationships, or prioritize rent over more important things (a medical treatment, a phone with internet access.) or go deeper into debt. The problems come out in society in less visible ways than homelessness, and they are multiplied."

Understand that, right in front of your eyes, are municipalities who have preyed on you, in order to make money, by the doctrine of ""natural monopolies"" and sold you the lie that they and only they can and must provide the roads and the utilities, and that therefore they must also control the rights of way, and that there is no other way to provide broadband, than to franchise out rights of way to one or two firms, and that otherwise broadband wouldn't happen because it's too expensive to tear up streets or string wires on existing telephone poles, frequently. . . it is impossible that real competition would find ways of doing things any differently or even making it profitable and worth it for consumers and road owners to give more than one right of way.

Because in their time, small business was more robust and powerful.  So big business, big military (both overseas and home), and a big book of legislation are all good things to them despite how dire the results are.

Eventually, you have the highly skilled forced to move because they can't afford the housing.   What you'll get is a bifurcated economy like most of the central american countries and pre-Chavez Venezuela. Only wealthy-upper middle class people and working poor can live there. This will result in the end of the consumer economy.  Regular people covet these houses is because they see them as a basic need.

lostgeneration,39yivg,sg92i,3,Tue Jun 16 16:47:57 2015 UTC,"So why there is not more affordable housing in New Jersey?   I think there are a lot of things at play here. The parts of NJ that have escaped development and remain fairly rural are also fairly isolated due to the way our roads are setup. It takes too long to commute from these areas even if they are physically closer to NYC on a map. No one wants to spend money on roads anymore, with more than a third of the bridges in PA alone closed for lack of repairs.  If someone is willing to commute quite a ways away from NY to get cheaper housing, chances are they will want some place right off a major highway in NJ or PA. In the case of NJ, these areas have already been developed into suburban hell, but could be redeveloped to make new apartment complexes if investors tried to do so. They won't. For reasons I cannot explain investors are only interested in funding large apartment complexes that cater to the super wealthy, with no interest in building low to medium range units. In NYC this has gotten so out of control that they'd build apartments for the super wealthy and sit on vacancies rather than take a gamble on a lower income clientele.  PA is attractive despite the distance because the tax burden is lower, and there has been a boom of condo development catering towards professionals who would be commuting to NYC. I also know of a lot of projects underway right now to turn what used to be mills & factories into apartments, but like in NYC they're all focused on wealthy clientele that may not exist in the numbers necessary to use all of that inventory.  So the low to medium range renters are being left out of the market. They can't afford this kind of a commute into NYC anyway so instead what's been happening is the poor end up leaving NYC for good and moving into the smaller cities of eastern Pennsylvania, where they end up renting POS row houses from slumlords. With the distance and cost of the commute to keep working in NYC it does not take them long to say screw it and find a min wage job local to them in PA instead of going back. Which is also why the police blotters in most eastern PA papers have so many entries for ""<name>, former of Brooklyn, arrested today for ___""  With all the transplants and the crime that's followed, these communities will take the professionals but they just don't want the poor."

And I know a lot of people, my parents included, who are having to work well beyond the age of retirement because of the economic problems going on, so this article is clearly spinning an angle.  It's just meant to spew up hatred and deflect blame.  Don't fall for it! The only way we get passed the greedy assholes is to band together, all of us, from all ages, and work towards cooperatively doing things more compassionately and thoughtfully."

I refuse to accept that I'm in any way culpable for the death of the progressive dream that happened while I was still in school, sorry. And it will be much, much harder to get it back than it would have been to defend it.  Lastly, leaving out people who are disabled or discriminated against, Boomers have ZERO FUCKING REASON to complain about having no money. They grew up in the period of greatest prosperity in the most prosperous nation on earth, with a stock market going up their entire lives. If you couldn't save what you earned from your overpaid, low skill job then, that's on you.   Their inability to not spend everything they have NOW NOW NOW is not a luxury we have, and it means they will be occupying good jobs our generation should have while they try to pay off their Restoration Hardware credit card instead of that money going to pay down student loans. They didn't have ANY student loans! ANY! And I should be compassionate about their Harley debt. Fuck that.

That's no fault of the Boomers, though. The war offered a period of unprecedented, extremely circumstantial growth. They were born into it, and it would be misguided to judge them for not sustaining growth created under such abnormal circumstances.   I also don't think it's ageism to take them to task for who they voted for - they voted for Reagan, I voted for Obama. We got something similar but at least I was trying to make things better for folks besides myself.   I'm not really sure if this is an issue now. Politics has become so corporate fascist. I believe the downhill trend started before Regan with JFK's assassination and the creation of the 'Deep State', something people did not vote for, but happened 'behind the scenes' as a power grab, and its existence which became more obvious in the Contras. You see the same 'Deep State' active now funding and abating terrorists in order to play political games in the Middle East.     Their inability to not spend everything they have NOW NOW NOW is not a luxury we have, and it means they will be occupying good jobs our generation should have while they try to pay off their Restoration Hardware credit card instead of that money going to pay down student loans. They didn't have ANY student loans! ANY! And I should be compassionate about their Harley debt. Fuck that.   You are making major generalizations. This is the narrative that is being played out, and it's simply not true for the majority of baby boomers. Most are not economically as well off as people insist, and the ones who made the mistakes of spending NOW NOW NOW were bombarded by Bernay's style propoganda from bankers and corporations to spend, spend, spend. Many got suckered, it's true, but it was because of the prevailing social norms pushed by the people who ultimately benefited from pushing easy credit - banks and Wall Street...    Fuck the Boomers, fuck the rich ones, and fuck the poor idiot ones who couldn't make the 20th century work for them.   I understand that you are angry with the way things are. Many people are, and I am too, but I also realize that condemning an entire age group of people is counter-productive to any change we can hope to make.

Perhaps because those people are largely voiceless except through their collective representatives, many of which have been rendered mute via the takeover of union leadership positions by those who are 'playing along' with the owners or just rendered obsolete by offshoring or the downturn of the economy, we are left with arguments over the remaining 'power' groups (teachers and other .gov based unions) which have become easy pickings indeed (not that there isn't much to critique).

Until that happens, the few practice lawful plunder upon the many, a common practice where the right to participate in the making of law is limited to a few persons. But then, participation in the making of law becomes universal. And then, men seek to balance their conflicting interests by universal plunder. Instead of rooting out the injustices found in society, they make these injustices general. As soon as the plundered classes gain political power, they establish a system of reprisals against other classes. They do not abolish legal plunder. (This objective would demand more enlightenment than they possess.) Instead, they emulate their evil predecessors by participating in this legal plunder, even though it is against their own interests.    As I have said, there is nothing that gets put forth here that hasn't been addressed and shown to be wrong hundreds of years ago.

We are currently suffering from an imbalance of power and a gross imbalance of wealth. This has been verified by innumerable sources from across the whole political spectrum. So when the powerless are able to speak only ""to the length and ability they have,"" their ability is then limited. When the wealthy and powerful are ""equally"" able to speak to the length and ability they have, their voice is louder, more widely broadcasted, heard by more and its importance is inflated for both justified and unjustified reasons.  So while ""equal"" means powerful and powerless are ""equally"" able to raise money and be heard, in practice they are not equal in their ability to speak and be heard.  ""Just"" (justice) would be, all parties are given an ""equal"" platform to speak and be heard through campaign finance reform (whether the solution described here or otherwise).

The second you decide to use government force for the public good, or to force some sense of equality because it meets ""your"" sense and understanding of what is just, you have just allowed any tyrant(and they always think they are being good and just) to do what they will, and that always ends up bad, despite the wording being so nice.    To put it another way:   Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive… The robber baron’s cruelty may sometimes sleep,…but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.

Regardless if they are incredibly polite, or not. The metric holds. Statement that allows, promotes or justifies living off of another human being and not being accountable to yourself are upvoted along with those telling people how hopeless it all is because of [insert enemy du jour], those that are more on that things can be done, life can get better through your work, that you shouldn't be dependent on the state or others get horribly downvoted. Regardless how it is phrased or how politely it is phrased.

All he is talking about is ""legal plunder"". He isn't speaking the truth, he is speaking in typical professional politicianeese because if he did speak the truth, this sub would be forced to accept what they are really after is getting other people to pay for their shit, and that isn't nearly as noble as the delusional around here would want to believe. ,   Again, Think. For gods sake use that thing between your ears and Sanders (Like most politicians) words fall like the vaporware they are. But then, people might have to be accountable for themselves and if there is one thing this sub shows on the daily is that it is completely unwilling to be is accountable.   Legal Plunder:   “But how is this legal plunder to be identified? Quite simply. See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime.” ― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law    He is referring to teachers here, but it can equally be given to any governmental agency..   “You say: ""There are persons who lack education"" and you turn to the law. But the law is not, in itself, a torch of learning which shines its light abroad. The law extends over a society where some persons have knowledge and others do not; where some citizens need to learn, and others can teach. In this matter of education, the law has only two alternatives: It can permit this transaction of teaching-and-learning to operate freely and without the use of force, or it can force human wills in this matter by taking from some of them enough to pay the teachers who are appointed by government to instruct others, without charge. But in the second case, the law commits legal plunder by violating liberty and property.” ― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law    and why does the young, and this sub, continually ignore or refuse to see this legal plunder? Easy. Because they were never taught the distinction between government and society, they think the two are the same, when they are not. Of course, the young being taught by the public sector unionist who have a vested interest in keeping them ignorant of this distinction is the reason for this ignorance but regardless of the reason of ignorance, is still no reason to still be ignorant in this day and age especially when you are trying to justify taking from your fellow man.    “Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.” ― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law"

Do you think kids today know any of the basic rules of arithmetic or language better than their great grandparents did without a tenth of the funding? There will always be those with more, and those with less. Maybe, just maybe, if we weren't trying to equalize those things that can never be equalized, we might actually have the funding to do other things.

Take a look at some of the Scandinavian countries, with the recent amount of immigrants having to cut off a lot of their services, and limit them.   Everywhere these ideas fail. The difference is the amount of time it takes for them to fail. In a small, homogeneous society it takes a lot of time before they fail. In places where there is a large, diverse population it fails really quick and turns violent a lot faster as those that think they are entitled to stuff paid for by others, get angry at others for not providing it for them.   I urge you, please go and live in these countries he is trying to emulate and when you come back, I'll accept your apology,.

And having a penis won't help you either."
lostgeneration,39wy7z,alexgmcm,2,Tue Jun 16 07:35:06 2015 UTC,"This seems like a perception problem.  Lots of people from elite schools are having trouble, especially those with graduate degrees.  Another thing to consider is that much of the workforce and most workplaces are still old enough to predate all of these changes.  People from top schools still have top positions because that is how things worked for a very long time.  Top schools being so selective and expensive that access is cut off for those with merit is a relatively new thing.  In contrast when I as a baby bust generation member applied to schools there was a lack of qualified students and a surplus of available assistance which at that time had more grants relative to loans than now.  Thinking that college and work have always been as they are now is a huge mistake.  The system has been broken for a long time, but worked just well enough for most to get by and that is one of the reasons there is such resistance to change."
lostgeneration,39wyzm,fullmaltalchemist,12,Mon Jun 15 14:05:58 2015 UTC,One of the missing components in the trade agreements is any kind of serious requirement that low wage countries start working on building their own middle class. The actual tools for building a middle class are minimum wage laws and unions. Free trade can be an excellent tool for inviting poor countries to join civilization--but free trade fails if it does not require that shared prosperity through wages. It creates exactly what we have seen in the US--a downward pressure for people getting paychecks.  You can bet that the corporate interests are well represented in those contracts. Protections for intellectual property? Check. New laws creating rights for corporations wanting to sue a country? Check.  Trade agreements made with no regard to existing living wages... are a legal bludgeon used by business in negotiations with the paycheck class.
lostgeneration,39wyzm,joneSee,3,Mon Jun 15 15:02:03 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the notion of ""free trade"" as expressed by the U.S. has always had the same problems. Primarily because those who benefit from trade want it that way."

I don't think many Americans would mind free trade with countries that have comparable working conditions and environmental protections.  The problem is that the average American can't compete with someone who is able to work for $3/day, 80 hours a week, and where companies dump toxic waste unimpeded.  Nor should they.

Divorce is not pretty and takes a long time to recover from financially and emotionally, if you do at all.  These days people simply have no sense of security or social contract guaranteeing that people will behave decently or else be shunned by society like in days past. It's a free for all of narcissism and looking after #1. You have no economic security due to the global economy. You have no marriage security because ""to death do you part"" actually means: until he or she loses their job, doesn't provide the lifestyle/ status I feel I deserve, or looks at me funny.   Even if you have the best of intentions and you want to commit to someone and start a  family, you have to contend with Corporate America which is hostile towards families. They either don't provide enough time off for all staff (with or without children) to decompress and deal with outside obligations. Or when they do provide time off, it's on the backs of those who don't have a ""valid excuse"" (childless individuals and single people).   This just breeds resentment and creates a culture of people being afraid of taking time off even when they do have an H.R. sanctioned excuse to be absent because people will talk about them behind their backs and do passive aggressive things to vent frustration over the inequity of the situation."

Where I moved from in the SF Bay Area, a 1950's era ranch house goes for $700K+. The home itself is only worth slightly less than $100K in labor and materials, the rest is the cost of the land. Crazy expensive, but the politics in Northern California aren't really about devaluing property owner's equity by promoting policies to make housing denser and more affordable.  My current house (existing home) costs more than new homes in the outer suburbs of Minneapolis, but then again you're paying for location. I'm, in the city and I'm a 10 minute drive to anywhere in the metro area. I'm a block or two away from a creek, lake, parks, and other stuff that generally is desirable to live next to.

Fairly easy to say ""This is the floor plan, and this is the absolute best way to build it"".   Using this method supplies are delivered exactly when they are needed, the experienced trade crews cycle though at the right time and do the same job over and over again.  This also reduces the cost to build a home, thus the cost to purchase follows. While this does create cookie cutter homes, thats up to the homebuyer to decide if thats a tradeoff they are willing to make.  Using things like poor materials and and unstable workforce (read illegals), makes for higher costs to everyone, and irregular quality.  Which is also costly to the company..  While the problem you speak of is certainly not eliminated and still exists, its being pushed out.  Because those companies that dont do this cookie cutter approach, are doing truly custom homes (not ""custom"" in which you merely pick some paint color and choices of a few things..), custom in that everything including the floorplan is unique, require trusted individuals to execute. Since the buyer is likely fairly wealthy, putting a large deposit down upfront before construction begins, such standards can and are demanded by the consumer.   Not to mention...most of the home value is in the land...  I mean, check into the insurance costs should a house burn down...the cost to the insurer to rebuild the home is pretty minimal on your typical home (obviously not on the more expensive homes)."

If you're way down the depression hole, make small, tangible goals to start with (""I'll exercise twice this week, and maybe next week I'll exercise three times""). Stimulate your brain too. How bad is your depression? Is it interfering with your normal routine (work, school, hobbies, friends etc)? If so, how accessible is healthcare for you? If you don't have insurance (and even if you do), many mental health professionals (counselors, therapists, psychologists etc) have sliding scales to help patients who can't pay copays or high rates. Set an appointment and be honest with them about how you're feeling. They are trained to help and can provide tools and resources to help you through this. If they recommend medication and you're not a fan of SSRIs, remind yourself that you won't be taking this medicine forever -- it's just to help your brain get over this mountain.  Remind yourself that you can get through this. It's going to suck for a while, but you will make it out of this. Life will get better, and you won't feel like this forever."

Life will get better, and you won't feel like this forever.   I know you're trying to be helpful, but this statement bothers me for some reason. People tell me this all the time. But how can anyone else possibly know the future? How will they know that things will work out?  I think there's a difference between encouraging people not to give up and assuring them of something that simply cannot be proven.  I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be a dick.

I should have clarified that I was speaking more to those with the more severe types of depression, not 'situational' depression.   I in no way meant to come across as ""Things are going to be FANTASTIC just hang in there because sunshine roses rainbows!!!!!!"" By 'life will get better', I really only meant that these worst ever horrible, awful, mind-crushing feelings you experience every minute of the day are likely to diminish after you've treated the depression. For me, that is a better life.   I completely understand why it bothers you for people to be all gung-ho and THIS SHIT'S GONNA BE GREAT because it bothers the shit out of me too. It's the exact reason I don't discuss my mental health with anyone other than health professionals, my SO, and very close friends who are also diagnosed with the same types of depression I have. And reddit, apparently. :)   I'm not sure if you meant the 10 years comment about your life in general, or your dealings with depression, but in either case feel free to pm me if you want someone to rant or talk with."

lostgeneration,39t3av,noprotein,3,Mon Jun 15 13:34:46 2015 UTC,"I now (at 30) understand it to be this: it gets better. Because if it doesnt, there's no sense in arguing or fighting for it. With depression, obviously chemical imbalance and life being shit best you down but ultimately, at the end of the day, a huge percentage of surviving it is learning coping strategies, savoring and working for ittle victories and weathering the storm for a while.  All storms let up at some point, whether or not you survive is another story and truly challenging for us all, but the storm will pass and things will change, better or worse, it'll change for sure. So, those who have been there or who havent, can all technically say it does in fact get better, for us all, because we will what little we can to be better. Because of the strength from others saying and demonstrating through their words or strength/tenacity that it does.  So, it's sort of cyclical and self fulfilling. If you disagree that things get better, or this person never gets out of their funk, or they truly get shit on forever, then so be it, but let's acknowledge the far likelier scenario that all of the crap things aligning in one's life for a shit solstice won't stay for long, hopefully."

I'm upset that we're forced to work to live, but not necessarily for anything meaningful and it doesn't even really contribute to some grand society, just a consumer based system where we make rich folks richer and destroy the environment while making so many destitute.   I think it's natural and healthy for us to not be able to rectify the world we live in today with the ideals, ethics, values, etc we were raised on perhaps. We KNOW it's wrong, and yet, we all smile and nod as the circus goes on.  Things change though. Time, technology, generations, politics, war changes so much.

I feel great when I'm drinking. But, the relief I feel compels me to consume too much. As a result, I end up staying up late, going to bed late, not having the best sleep I could possibly have had, and waking up to grogginess in the morning/afternoon. Recently, I've had horrible episodes of anhedonia that follow a drinking ""session,"" resulting in pissing away perfectly good weekends. Not enough sleep. This is a tough one to fight. I typically stay up later than I should on the computer (like I am now), reading comments, articles, and desperately trying to find some ""magic bullet"" advice that will change my life. It's fruitless. Eating shitty food. I'm good at keeping this to a minimum. However, if I ever do indulge, it just fires up my anxiety, which in turn, worsens my depression. Feeling the need to stay ""on a schedule."" Some people say that scheduling activities actually helps with depression. I disagree. I can see how it might, to an extent. But with the ridiculous hours I work, I always end up beating myself up if I don't make time for x, y, or z during my evenings. And, heh... my job. I live to work, and this is probably the single greatest existential problem I face at the moment.   There are some things that help the most when I'm in a rut:   Someone to talk to. Even if it's someone on reddit who I've never met but can empathize with. It helps. It's even better when that other person is right in front of you and is on completely the same wavelength as you. Don't compare yourself to other people. Stop. Don't do it. Thoughts will enter your mind about how you're ""behind,"" ""not trying hard enough,"" etc. Just observe the thoughts and let them pass (i.e. ignore them). A great deal of life is, frankly, a crapshoot. People in positions of power and privilege aren't going to tell you that. Many people have rationalized their lives as being the product of solely their wisdom and hard work. Bullshit. It's much, much more complicated than the reductionist shit you often hear in the realm of ""positive thinking."" The gym can help, but let me qualify this: I used to be a gym rat. Missing days would give me horrible, horrible anxiety. If you can take some time to exercise for just a bit or lift some weights, it does help. Just don't let it consume your life. Otherwise, if your life circumstances change, keeping the gym as part of your regular schedule can make you just a tad neurotic. Especially when you pass up opportunities to be with your friends. On a side note, related to the previous bullet point, I've been reading lately that diet is actually more important than exercise. I'm not suggesting that people shouldn't exercise. But, diet does matter. Sticking with non and/or minimally processed foods will make a big, big difference. If there is something you can do to improve yourself and keep your mind off of the more depressing sides of humanity, I'd go for it."

Treating college like a commodity is a very smart thing to do because no rational person would rack up $200 on their credit card in order fill up their car with $30 worth of gas. Knowing exactly what your degree is worth, how much it will cost, and how long it will take you to pay back your loans is all valuable information.

Uber treats their employees as independent contractors, meaning no benefits like unemployment or health insurance compared to some cab companies. Uber also requires you to furnish and maintain your own vehicle, cab companies furnish their own vehicles that are maintained by the cab company (all you do is gas it if they don't pay for gas, and keep it clean during your shift, but vehicle maintenance isn't your responsibility.)   In being an Uber driver, you are using your vehicle for commercial purposes, which insurance doesn't cover Joe Blow for accidents if he was using his personal vehicle for a commercial purpose when he got into that accident, and Uber won't cover it because Joe Blow was an independent contractor, not an employee. A cab company must have insurance for all their drivers and cabs, and it's not cheap, think $500-$1000 for each cab.  Also, Uber has ""surge pricing,"" a model where you pay more for particularly popular times (i.e. rush hour, New year's, etc.), cabs have a regular fare posted on their doors and inside the vehicle.  Furthermore, cab drivers have separate cab/livery licenses from the taxi and limousine commission along with their driver's license in their respective areas, usually includes navigational testing of the city, fingerprinting, and a background check, Uber doesn't. Cab drivers must also display their livery license in the cab at all times where clearly visible to the passenger, and as stated before, Uber doesn't require a livery license.  They also don't have dispatchers, you are the dispatcher with the app.  E: clarity"

It sucked not having any guaranteed work, having crazy hours that change last minute, and trying to please everyone by bending over backwards while they expect 100% loyalty on a job that earn me 10% of my wages.  My point is, I didn't even SEE that. It didn't occur to me that uber drivers get the shaft just like I do by taking jobs like that. I am not sure if that alone is reason enough not to use them, but for a sympathy vote, I think I'm nearly there.  I heard that Uber does cover you insurance wise when you have a passenger. Is this no true, or untested ground?  As well, I know in Toronto there is a lot of problems with the current taxi system, where some people own cabs and the rest have to rent from them, so one cabbie earns money basically holding his licence hostage and selling it to the highest bidder so they can drive around and make cash. That makes me think the cab industry is kinda shitty, so a newcomer like Uber piques my interest.

NYC where I grew up has the same system, the medallion system where the yellow cabs/medallions are limited and the cab drivers that don't own their cabs pay a fee to use the cab for certain periods of time, basically renting the medallion, which is $1M in NYC.

Organizing street protests is less viable when you don't have hundreds or thousands of low-level workers together on the same factory floor. The fact that the injustice caused by the wage gap and death of unions has not resulted in the working poor starving to death makes organization and rhetoric more difficult as well. Rather, its an age where someone dirt-poor can have a cell phone and car - because they need them to work, and are constantly 1 blown head gasket or 1 broken arm away from living on the streets. The ramifications of the plight of the working poor ought to be re-framed and pushed to the forefront through online communications, in the voting booth, and modern civil disobedience at a massive scale.

Anecdotes of people leaving a 'work' life for an ownership life simply can't be the solution. The marketplace does not have enough opportunity to include everyone--and there are a lot of barriers to entry for new business people. I'm with you that it can happen--and I hope that it happens a lot--but it is not a solution for large numbers of people.   It is absolutely true that ownership gets paid and work does not. Wages are the missing component in the US economy. Meanwhile, it is a very simple idea that an 'owner' should pay a living wage if they occupy 40 hours of a person's life every week.  by the way... I really really like that you used this quote ""What else can I get for you today?"" instead of the old ""Would you like fries with that?"" All the jobs are McJobs these days."

lostgeneration,39lhiq,robster644,2,Fri Jun 12 17:49:36 2015 UTC,That the problem what I am seeing. I'm being told thats the only way to succeeded is to make a business. As you said its no possible for everyone to do that.
lostgeneration,39lhiq,lukertin,3,Fri Jun 12 20:00:24 2015 UTC,"That's all that is left. We exported most everything in manufacturing. When you graduate you are usually presented with, ""Congrats on starting adulthood! You can choose to work in the service industry OR the retail service industry. Trades are dwindling, and honest work doesn't pay fairly! Good luck kiddo!"""
lostgeneration,39lhiq,the_twitcher,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:06:11 2015 UTC,"The thing you are pointing to is middle-teir/class jobs disappearing. More rich people than every before, more poor people than ever before. We can look at certain markers-correlated with decline of unions, etc.   For over a decade, job gains have been concentrated largely in the low-wage service sector, such as in retail or hospitality, which alone accounted for nearly sixty percent of job gains; in contrast middle income positions actually have been declining. Meanwhile, taxes on corporate profits, which are at an all time high, have fallen to near historic lows. http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/10/in-the-future-we-ll-all-be-renters-america-s-disappearing-middle-class.html"

lostgeneration,39l5ig,fullmaltalchemist,5,Fri Jun 12 14:25:14 2015 UTC,"Americans can't compete against the low wages. This will have the same effect as NAFTA, except instead of sending jobs to mexico it opens the door for more jobs to get siphoned to China and other low manufacturing cost countries. Being that most of the deal is secret no one really knows to what extent of damage that could be done.  This might have a positive effect for consumers in that prices will go down most likely. But if you don't have a job you won't be able to afford to buy anything."
lostgeneration,39l5ig,bigdaveyl,6,Fri Jun 12 16:12:20 2015 UTC,"The deal is secret because if the general populace knew what was in it, there would be hell to pay."
lostgeneration,39l5ig,Nelliell,5,Fri Jun 12 17:06:44 2015 UTC,"I can confirm this; I have a relative who used to work at that Maytag plant. They worked there 30 years before the plant moved to Mexico. Things became very difficult for their family after the plant closed. They lost their house (foreclosure), had to declare bankruptcy due to medical costs, and were unemployed for a long time before finding something that didn't pay nearly as well. Screw NAFTA and the TPP."
lostgeneration,39l5ig,joneSee,4,Sat Jun 13 02:39:09 2015 UTC,"The missing mechanism in trade agreements is a requirement for the 'developing' country to work on creating their own middle class--by using laws. Minimum wage laws and legal protections for trade unions.  Free trade is a truly great idea for civilization--if it is intended and managed as an upward arc for ALL people. It can and should be a means to extend out the wealth created by the broad economic participation in developed countries. Instead, putting corporate shills in charge of every detail seems to be part of the tactics of beating the crap out of ALL US/Euro wages. Even though it is impossible to export the task of having your toilet cleaned... conservatives, Republicans and libertarians want that working person to be forced to compete with Vietnam's 56 pennies per hour.  If free trade does not protect and expand civilization by growing the wages of all people--it simply should not be allowed. Worth noting that these are deep treaties--and treaties are an obligation that is often defended with blood and treasure. Countries go to war over treaties. If the corporations manage the process to disallow ordinary people--they should pay for their own war when shit goes down."
lostgeneration,39l5ig,lukertin,3,Fri Jun 12 15:32:29 2015 UTC,If the corporations manage the process to disallow ordinary people--they should pay for their own war when shit goes down.   Do you honestly expect corporations to pay for anything?
lostgeneration,39l5ig,joneSee,2,Fri Jun 12 15:46:42 2015 UTC,Yes. Laws matter. For example... corporations do not exist without laws.
lostgeneration,39l5ig,lukertin,3,Fri Jun 12 17:30:53 2015 UTC,Laws are meaningless to a corporation that can pay to have them changed.
lostgeneration,39l5ig,bigdaveyl,2,Fri Jun 12 17:31:39 2015 UTC,"I'm all for free trade...  When there is an ever playing field that is...  What I mean, I don't mind seeing agreements with countries like Canada, Australia, the EU, where they generally have somewhat equal protections for the workers and environment.  In other words, all the factory workers aren't being paid $3/day and industry is allowed to dump toxic waste into the water supply unimpeded.  Also, it should be noted that if people wanted to pick up and move to Western Europe because their job sent them there, they could enjoy much of the same standard of living that is enjoyed in the US/Canada (if not higher).  I've been to 3rd world countries and I couldn't get out fast enough."
lostgeneration,39l5ig,JustStopDude,2,Fri Jun 12 17:06:00 2015 UTC,Why should EU companies have to compete with American workers who work for less money and have no worker protectons?   I don’t see the difference between a US or a Chinese factory worker other than one of them is really oblivious about how shit their lot is.
lostgeneration,39l5ig,dharmabird67,2,Sat Jun 13 20:13:41 2015 UTC,"The difference between the US and Chinese factory worker is the Chinese one isn't in danger of being homeless - as crappy as their jobs are, at least they are provided dorms so they won't end up in the streets - can't say the same for any US workers."
lostgeneration,39l5ig,JustStopDude,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:25:48 2015 UTC,"You have no idea what you are talking about.  The majority of Chinese factory workers do not have access to company dormitories. Housing is in much shorter supplier and far more expensive in China than in the US. China has significant homeless rates, only its illegal to report or even acknowledge it.  I've worked in  China. You don't want to work in China."
