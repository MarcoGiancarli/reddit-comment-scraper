I'm not saying I made the original designs, I'm obviously not someone that made the game. I'm just saying that I spend time making the images, putting them together, etc. and I don't want people to just go and take credit for that. As an artist, the things I do are things I've done. Sure, someone may come out with these and give them out for free. That's no problem, but my stuff is still my stuff."
fo3,3dvx07,GSlayerBrian,2,Mon Jul 20 14:44:10 2015 UTC,"I had missed the ""I designed all of the images in the center of the pages,"" but that actually kindof makes it worse. To my eye they look like carbon copies of the versions in the game, so personally I would have just ripped them directly. Why go through all the extra work to make something that an avid Fallout 3 fan and intermediate graphics designer can't tell apart from the original content?  Anyway, in the end I wasn't trying to criticize, I was just poking fun. :-P"
fo3,3dvx07,GSlayerBrian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:02:04 2015 UTC,"I've heard ripping directly from the game is not good when you're using things for other things. Low resolution or something? That being said, I couldn't do it even if I knew how as I have a Mac now. Plus, it's more fun to just do them yourself. It's not really meant to make people think there's a difference aside from what I mentioned (some areas are thinner, removed, or less bold) in the Imgur album. I just like adding some differences in for myself, same reason why I created the extra things to go with the G.O.A.T. as a whole."
fo3,3dvx07,ParamusGaming,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:08:44 2015 UTC,"Well, even by ""directly"" I guess I mean more like taking the game assets (extracting from the BSA, not using a screenshot) and vectorizing them, rather than redrawing them by hand. If you have the skill to hand redraw them and have them look that close to the originals, then I applaud your artistic talent. (That said, no reason you couldn't do that on a Mac. Files is files.)"

You should try installing it to check if the night isn't too dark for your liking, I know that it does brighten up some parts of the game quite a bit, mainly the outdoor environments. As for the game's textures there aren't many complete overhauls as far as texture packs go, and most of them aren't what you're looking for. I would say that you should look through the Nexus to find a group of smaller texture packs to install that fit your preferences (one for the terrain, one for the interiors, one for the cities, etc.)"

The gear from Operation Anchorage is amazing for that especially if you've got 100 Energy Weapons - you get an energy sniper rifle (gauss rifle) that knocks down enemies. And, if you're good with regular guns, there's a quest in Point Lookout that gives you a rifle that's as good as (if not better than for its crits) Lincoln's Repeater and uses cheap 10mm rounds."

As for exploring, if you haven't done Fort Constantine yet, you should talk with Crowley in Underworld to get You Gotta Shoot Them In The Head - that'll take you to a few places. Girdershade has the Nuka Cola Challenge - 30 Quantums for money and a Nuka Grenade schematic, plus the location for the Nuka Cola Plant. Oasis is a fun time too, if you haven't been.   Also, make sure you tag the Dunwich Building in the southwest at some point - Point Lookout has a quest that can require you to go back to it later on."

fo3,3drwgh,Canibananalism-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:29:41 2015 UTC,"Oasis is near the northern border of the map, near the Clifftop Shacks, east (plus a little bit south) of the Radio Tower from The Pitt, and west of Old Olney/Vault 92 (about halfway between them, iirc).

fo3,3dqegc,AVestedInterest,4,Sat Jul 18 14:06:24 2015 UTC,"Start with all of them loaded. (Some mods require some/all of the DLCs loaded).  I would recommend doing them in this order:   The Pitt Short but rich adventure. Can't use your gear anyway until later on (when you don't need it as much). High skills help, but aren't necessary. Operation Anchorage Gives you some really great equipment which makes doing subsequent content a lot easier, while not being particularly challenging itself. Broken Steel Also gives good equipment. Lots and lots of power armor and energy weapons. It's also XP soup. Mothership Zeta Personally I can take or leave this DLC because it's just too zany for my tastes. Gives overpowered equipment if you don't mind looking really stupid. Point Lookout The most challenging of all the DLCs, you'll want to be a high level and well-geared for this one."
fo3,3dqegc,GSlayerBrian,3,Sat Jul 18 15:28:17 2015 UTC,"You could really load them all at once.  In the base game, everything ended with the final main quest.... with broken steel installed, you wake up with a ""new"" main quest and can still wander the wasteland like normal.  All the other dlc are activated when you reach a map marker for them (a pop up menu will tell you a dlc is starting). They all take you to a new location you must stay in until that quest line is complete. They all give give pretty good armor and weapons to use for most any point of the game.  I'd recommend point lookout for last (enemies have inflated damage weapons, very difficult), but the order is irrelevant for the rest of the dlc. Anchorage dlc will give you the ability to wear power armor earlier than than the main quest (even at level 1), but personally that's kind of game breaking)."

fo3,3dqegc,AVestedInterest,2,Sat Jul 18 14:04:58 2015 UTC,"Don't have an order to give you, but I do recommend that you finish Operation Anchorage last or at least close to last because it gives you OP items such as, the Winterized TB-51b P.A which is unbreakable due to a bug in game, the Chinese Stealth Suit which gives you permanent stealth while crouching (can walk while crouching + walking), the Gauss Rifle which stuns your enemy when it crits, and Jingwei's Shocksword which is that equivalent of the Shiskebab in terms of damage (shocks the enemy too) which makes the game boring unless you're playing the hardest mode.

fo3,3dpi4d,SystemFolder,3,Sat Jul 18 08:42:28 2015 UTC,"You may want to do some editing eventually, otherwise you would have to fill space by constantly talking when exploring or just walking to a quest target;  Read the following while imagining walking towards Tenpenny tower from Megaton maybe:  ""Usually i'd like to do some random exploring before i bother with the Quests because that way i can put some Points into skills that are used in skills in some quests. Fallout 3 has more Quests where the Skillcheck happens and then you can't go back and restart the Conversation after you buffed yourself. New Vegas on the other Hand might very well tempt me to exit Conversations only to read a skill magazine right in front of the Character that Skillchecks me and then talking to him. So in Games like this, i like to kill some Monsters first so i can be sure to have most of the Skill requirements for 'Babie's first Skill check' Quest in starter towns, like the Bomb in Megaton for example which needs 25 explosives skill to disarm.""  That was something that i just came up with off the top of my head. How much of the way to tenpenny tower did i walk? Not all that much. Without editing one would have to endlessly talk just to fill space. I doubt anyone would want to watch a Lone Wanderer just doing the thing he's named for and nothing else.  But, if you editing game is really shitty, you might put it off for a while and simply show off all the stats via pip boy and explain what you want to do with them."

I think the bug was introduced with Broken Steel, possibly because that DLC opened up the endgame and made it possible to play past the ending.  It may just be that Bethesda added new flags for Three Dog in the Broken Steel DLC, and those flags weren't implemented properly, so he talks about things that haven't happened yet. I.E, instead of defaulting to off, if you have the DLC activated, those flags default to on, because they didn't add a quest completed check to the last quest of the base game with no DLCs in order to toggle it. That would be my best guess, anyway."

fo3,3dbn9p,hbocao,-1,Sat Jul 18 12:28:48 2015 UTC,The DLCs are good to have installed from when you first start. They have some tweaks and patches that really help the game. As for the gameplay add ons you don't have to start them until you feel like it. Broken steel adds content to after you have beaten the game but the rest can be started at any time and don't affect gameplay or story at all. However I would suggest holding off on mothership zeta until you have beaten the game. It gets a little unballanced when you're level 5 and have enough alien weaponry to turn every raider in the wasteland into a pile of dust.

But the engineers didn't plan for the cars sitting around for two hundred years (maybe due to the volatile nature of their reactors, Chrysus had a policy of having your reactor changed every twenty years or so), so eventually the shielding began to fail and 200 years later all the reactors are pretty much on hair triggers."

But hey, as for how the combat works and whether it's immersive, I think you should give it a chance how it is. It weirded me out too when I first played this game. Being used to FPS' (tactical ones in particular), it was just bizarre to me to shoot an enemy in the head (even with a dinky .32 pistol) and not one-shot-kill them. BUT, I eventually came to understand and appreciate the reasons for it.  Specifically, FO3 isn't an FPS, it's an action RPG which just so happens to have guns in it, so it's not even trying to have realistic damage. Ultimately, the combat is more about your character's level of skill than your own prowess at aiming your shots. It's about stats and chances. Accordingly, many of the combat mechanics, like damage, DPS, accuracy (in and out of VATS), critical hit chance, etc. are derived from your character's stats.  Sure, you can mod it so that every gun is a 1-2 shot kill, but that takes a sledgehammer to half of the gameplay mechanics, invalidating everything from sneak attack criticals to damage reduction from armour and perks. So I really don't think it's a good idea. Besides, applying one-shot-one-kill rules to Fallout gameplay doesn't really work out that well apparently. :P"

fo3,3crmpk,Riidgedog,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:59:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't know this was your first play-through, yeah Butch DeLoria can be a companion if you have neutral karma when you get further into the game. If you have anymore questions on Fallout you can always message me."
fo3,3crmpk,MrMorninWood,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:48:38 2015 UTC,How can I even recruit him? O:
fo3,3crmpk,Toro_Loco500,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:39:28 2015 UTC,"After you find your father in Fallout 3, after the quest ""The Waters of Life"" when you walk in front of Megaton, or anywhere close to Vault 101 you will get a distress call from Vault 101 and a quest will be initiated called ""Trouble on the Homefront"" I highly suggest to not google anything until after you have completed The Waters of Life quest since it will contain spoilers. You can then read online about Trouble on the Homefront quest and how to get Butch as a companion if you have Neutral Karma."
fo3,3crmpk,MrMorninWood,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:04:06 2015 UTC,So... I can go back into the vault? I missed the medicine bobble head even though I saw it.
fo3,3crmpk,MrMorninWood,2,Sat Jul 11 03:18:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, You will be able to pickup the medicine bobblehead again in Trouble on the Homefront."
fo3,3crmpk,MrMorninWood,2,Sat Jul 11 03:20:51 2015 UTC,I seem. I'll do my best to get it without going around shooting at stuff and forgetting about it.
fo3,3crmpk,SoopahFreek90,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:59:25 2015 UTC,Sounds good. :D
fo3,3crmpk,SoopahFreek90,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:38:48 2015 UTC,Maybe you could spawn in Azrukhal?
fo3,3crmpk,Kittenclysm,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:48:09 2015 UTC,And revive him?
fo3,3cpy1j,Nerevarine87,8,Thu Jul 9 20:55:23 2015 UTC,"Nah, the ""sacrifice"" option just puts you in a coma for two weeks.  Broken Steel also gives you the option of telling Fawkes, Charon, or RL-3 to do it. The narrator will still call you a coward, though."
fo3,3cpy1j,AVestedInterest,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:37:20 2015 UTC,No.
fo3,3cpy1j,vraleigh,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:49:31 2015 UTC,A similar question. I have GOTY and after completing the game it does not transition into Broken Steel. Anyone know anything to fix that.
fo3,3cobpb,AsiaDerp,2,Thu Jul 9 13:42:58 2015 UTC,Post your full load order. Nobody can give you solid advice without first ruling out an issue with your mods. Also please post system specs.

fo3,3cll3w,JQbd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:21:14 2015 UTC,It's been a while for me. Isn't the rest of the quest on her computer?
fo3,3cll3w,Dreambuyer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:13:16 2015 UTC,"After you retrieve the book, you're supposed to go back to her tent and find her dead inside with a holo tape about the Dunwich Building. But without her, finishing her side is impossible :/"
fo3,3cjlgl,Rape_Clown,7,Wed Jul 8 12:31:19 2015 UTC,Walk in the opposite direction of your quests.
fo3,3cjlgl,ranhalt,4,Wed Jul 8 19:33:35 2015 UTC,"Contracts are after you get a certain perk.  The ""good"" one, Lawbringer, gives you a finger whenever you kill an evil character that you can sell for caps. The evil one, Contract killer, gives you ears on good characters' bodies that you can also trade in for caps.  Each thing you trade in is one contract on your stats. As for side quests, you can look on the wiki for the biggest side quests. Look at the rewards because you can get some cool unique weapons"
fo3,3cjlgl,chadunn13,2,Wed Jul 8 12:37:28 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I'll be sure to do that and thanks for the info on the contracts."
fo3,3cjlgl,Lambaline,2,Wed Jul 8 13:00:50 2015 UTC,"You can get both perks, by the way."
fo3,3cjlgl,charonn0,2,Wed Jul 8 15:44:48 2015 UTC,"I should've thought of this earlier considering I found Bigtown in this very way. Before I did the littleshitlight quest of course. Also, I have windows 7 so the game was incompatible with my Pc which was pretty annoyning. I tried to figure out how to solve it but, I spent 15 minutes trying with no luck. After that I went to gamestop and bought the GOTY for like $15 for 360.  Note: I regret I didn't enslave all those kids & I thought there was like a town called bottom line xD"
fo3,3cjlgl,fishy57,5,Wed Jul 8 13:23:58 2015 UTC,"The hollow triangles indicate a nearby undiscovered location/map marker (solid triangles are already discovered.) Head towards them to find out what is there. If you're bored and don't feel like advancing the main story pick an already discovered location and start walking until you see these markers. Once you've discovered a location you can fast-travel directly there using your Pip-boy map.   Side quests are almost always given by a NPC, so talk to any NPCs you come across. If you encounter a non-hostile NPC out walking the wastes or in the depths of some dungeon, they're almost always either a merchant or a quest-giver. Undiscovered locations with non-hostile NPCs are almost guaranteed to have a side-quest or two.  Contracts are available only if you have the ""Contract Killer"" perk. You can choose a new perk every time you level up. Once you have the perk, the identity and location of the bounty setter is revealed. Note that this is the ""Bad Karma"" version of the perk; the ""Good Karma"" version is called ""Lawbringer"" and has a different bounty setter. Neither of these perks actually give you specific targets to kill, but reward you based on the number of good/bad NPCs you kill.   These are unrelated to the bounty hunters that come after you. These bounty hunters are random encounters based on your karma level and location. It is possible for them to die before they find you, but only on occasion."
fo3,3cjlgl,ThatSwigglyLine,3,Wed Jul 8 13:35:25 2015 UTC,Upgrade Lockpick. Trust me.
fo3,3cjlgl,VanCardboardbox,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:35:18 2015 UTC,100 lockpick and science make completing quests so much easier.
fo3,3cjlgl,icemountainisnextome,2,Wed Jul 8 19:11:17 2015 UTC,"Though there is a main story to pursue, the real focus of this game is exploration. Go out and explore. Side quests can usually be found by exploring newly discovered locations, by talking to people, picking up notes etc. Chat with everyone you meet. Go to every empty triangle (undiscovered locations) that shows up on your compass. Pick up every holotape. Read every terminal entry.   I have about 500+ hours across four play-throughs (FO3 is a beloved fave of mine) and I was still finding things I had never noticed to the very last."
fo3,3cjlgl,cougasaurus,2,Thu Jul 16 20:52:28 2015 UTC,You're not exploring enough bottom line. My girlfriend did the same thing. She loved it and binged on it for about two weeks then she started playing Civ again and I asked was fallout too hard and she said she ran out of things to do haha
fo3,3cjlgl,locksofmop,3,Wed Jul 8 16:26:45 2015 UTC,"Bottom line, you're not exploring enough.   FTFY"
fo3,3cjlgl,technicallymexican,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:40:36 2015 UTC,Bottom line ? Explain...
fo3,3cjlgl,slandeh,2,Wed Jul 8 15:53:06 2015 UTC,Go explore. Pick a direction and walk in it for a while or explore some old vaults. That was always my favorite thing to do.
fo3,3cjlgl,technicallymexican,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:59:38 2015 UTC,"Follow the main story, then by talking to people in the same town as the objective you will get side-quests and information."
fo3,3cjlgl,slandeh,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:22:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely more to that. Don't just stick to the towns objectives exist in. The Power Stations? They have secret loot and some are part of quests. Vaults? There are a couple more than the ones related to your quest. Have you ever heard of Andale? Canterbury Commons? Did you destroy Megaton, or did you find Tenpenny Tower? Want those snooty assholes to be overrun by ghouls? There's a lot of sneaky quests you can get, and even some unmarked quests that don't get listed in your pip-boy.  Ever hear of ""Shelter""?"
fo3,3cjlgl,Plugeth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:35:16 2015 UTC,"Nope, what is it?"
fo3,3cmdom,Rugby562,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:04:44 2015 UTC,"Try the FAQ in /r/falloutmods, or post if you don't get the information you need."
fo3,3cmdom,Shaka1277,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:57:09 2015 UTC,...That's not how mods work. If you are picking mods based on the sole reason that they're packaged in .fomods maybe you aren't ready for mods.
