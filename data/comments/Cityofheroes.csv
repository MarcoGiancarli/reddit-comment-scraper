That a GTA sized city where you do super hero stuff, throw in a selection of powers and a robust character creator and it'll sell itself. Add in multiplayer and its an instant classic.  He was intrigued to say the least. I doubt he has the connections to suggest such a game, but it'd be amazing to see."

Cityofheroes,3chkxy,Nightsjester,3,Tue Jul 7 23:35:53 2015 UTC,I have played virtually every major mmo out there right now and you won't find it. The closest I have seen is the sorcerer class in Elder scrolls online.
Cityofheroes,3chkxy,Oliin,3,Wed Jul 8 00:28:29 2015 UTC,The general mindset of game developers seems to be that control classes are bad for gameplay fun. Since fighting an enemy that's just standing there is boring. Also pets are really server intensive which is why you see less pet classes in MMOs nowdays.  Also it's really hard to design both a class and encounters in a way that a control class can both be useful in a raid type situation and yet not invalidate the mechanics of the encounters.  I don't completely agree with that mind you but I get where they're coming from at least.

Cityofheroes,3chkxy,TehPsi,2,Sun Jul 12 17:35:13 2015 UTC,"This might seem a little odd, but I have to say Jedi Shadow/Sith Assassin in SWTOR are really giving me the feel of being a Dominator.  Hear me out.   They have their basic 4 second stun, but they also have  An 8 second sleep (that can be upgraded to activate instantly and cause a 2 second stun when it wears off -and- can be upgraded to an AoE for three enemies at once),  They have a 60 second sleep that can be activated from stealth They get a 4 second sleep from stealth. They get an AoE Knock Down They get a Single Target Knockdown And if you go with the Infiltration tree, they get another 4 second sleep   All in all, they have a lot of potential for locking things down. Admittedly, several of these things are sleeps, so they're broken by damage, but that can easily be overcome with some team coordination. And is a non issue when Soloing. Just make sure your companion isn't using AoEs."
Cityofheroes,3chkxy,TehPsi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:06:01 2015 UTC,"To further that thought, Smuggler Scoundrels/Agent Operatives get a similar suite of abilities. Stealth sleeps, stuns, etc. They do have their differences, though. For instance, they have 60 second droid ""hack"" that acts as a sleep, and only effects droids."
Cityofheroes,3chkxy,TehPsi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:13:03 2015 UTC,"Oooh sounds good!  I'll have to take a look.  What is SWTOR like?  I've played KOTOR and KOTOR2 and obviously loved them (what is there not to like), but I never got into TOR.  Does it play like CoX at all?  What is the power tree like?"
Cityofheroes,3chkxy,Vestus65,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:37:32 2015 UTC,"The customization for powers isn't nearly as open as CoH was. Not by a long shot, but that doesn't mean it's not fun. Each character class has two sub classes, and each sub class has 3 trees to pick. So there is still a bit of variation from player to player.  While there used to actually be skill trees to pick and choose from, they've recently simplified the whole thing. So as you level, you automatically get the next bonus/skill in line. Though, every 9 levels or so, you get a choice of a special bonus, which adds to the customization.  SWTOR itself plays like a standard point-and-click MMO. I've never played WoW so I can't comment to the similarities between the two, but SWTOR is generally very fast and engaging in its combat, in my opinion.  Like I said, it's not as in depth as CoH, but SWTOR certainly has its charm. And the storytelling is pretty fantastic, and is going to be more streamlined when the next expansion hits in October.  Edit: It's worth noting that SWTOR is much better about appearance customization, if that's important to you. They now have a system similar to Age of Conan or DCUO where you can wear one set of gear for the stats, and another set for the visuals."
Cityofheroes,3chkxy,Gnarlstone,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:56:46 2015 UTC,"One of the only games that has given me a slight taste of mastermind gameplay has been Star Trek Online, ironically enough. Ground missions are you (your player character) and your away team officers (four pets). You can choose to take science officers for heals, engineers to drop turrets and health generators, tactical officers for tanking or DPS. It doesn't match the pure awesomeness that was the CoH/CoV mastermind, but it scratches the itch, if only slightly.  Plus since STO is also a Cryptic game, it reminds me of CoH in various little ways."

Although there’s something poetically perfect about its being lost to the moment. After the conversation was done, neither of us wanted to leave – the location had taken on meaning, and our leaving it would mean it was destroyed forever. We awkwardly hung out a bit longer, pondering the finality of it, before giving in and spawning back on the streets above.   It wasn't always about the awesome fights, the amazing powers, the bonkers costumes. What made this game home for a lot of people, uh, was the people. The ones you saw. The ones you met. The ones who ran the game."

No other MMO I've played before or since has had the same degree of direct developer involvement on a daily basis, both in and out of game.  I think we were rather spoiled in that regard compared to most other MMOs, and I find myself sorely missing it from the games I've played since CoX."
Cityofheroes,3bweju,borticus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:56:26 2015 UTC,"I played one MMO seriously before CoH and we were definitely spoiled by the relationship we had with our developers. Even if they were constrained, they still engaged on the official forums - sometimes on serious issues and often enough on other community happenings. It was crystal clear that building the game wasn't just a job. They not only loved the project but they enjoyed the community, they enjoyed being the community. It was always a madhouse when either a community representative or a developer appeared somewhere. But in a good way.  I think a lot of that attitude grew out of how we all survived the first Cryptic purge."

VO looks a LOT more similar to COH, even down to some of the animations. It also is moving along at a much faster clip than CoT.  Finally, they even have one of the original Devs and seem to be a little more legitimate (ie, not a company made of volunteers like COT).  I hope for the best for both, but I think VO is the one that will be closest to a true spiritual successor at this stage of both games."

It wasn't really longevity we were worried about when we made the move, or even graphics - Unreal 3 is honestly good for both, though of course UE4 takes them quite a bit farther. It's the advances in how you can develop your game that sold us. It allows team members to do things that only a coder/programmer could have done before, which is a huge boost to our productivity. For a regular studio it's money saved on more employees. For us? It's almost literally the creation of human resources. And there are other examples in a similar vein.

Cityofheroes,3b41bz,MWM_Shadow_Elusive,3,Tue Jun 30 20:22:37 2015 UTC,"Am I understanding this correctly?    Been buidling the game from scratch for 19 months.  No tangible progress to show, just some concept models  Stole nearly $700k from the community at a vulnerable time  Is now announcing that they need MORE money and will be going the crowdfunding route again - just so people that already backed them can fork over even more money.   At this point I feel they are right up there with GoldenGirl and H&V.  Help us Valiance Online, you're our only hope."
Cityofheroes,3b41bz,BoldArch,5,Fri Jun 26 20:34:26 2015 UTC,"Your first two points mean nothing at all--all games are ""built from scratch,"" and they've had exactly as much progress as you could reasonably expect from the initial stages of MMO development.   Your third relies on the logic that ""donation"" equals ""theft."" No. Even if the project folded right now and they lost everything--no.   The fourth: Of course they're asking for money. MMOs are extremely costly to make, and the community has been badgering them for actual facts years now to run another crowdfunding campaign. And they've had the good grace to at least wait until they've had something to show for the first one.  All in all, you're ""understanding this correctly"" in the same way that conservatives understand the gay marriage ruling."
Cityofheroes,3b41bz,Innappropriarch,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:07:13 2015 UTC,"Points 1&2 - from my limited understand of game development, 19 months of progress should progress beyond... fuck.... I got my games mixed up.  I was thinking of the H&V ""teaser"" video.  I was under the momentary impression that the H&V teaser was the only thing that CoT released and that H&V released drawings.  SO my bad on that one.  For #3 I think it was a shitty thing to do to raise a kickstarter as emotions were high with no proven track record that they even had the capability and knowledge to release a game on the scale of an MMO.  I understand the difference between a donation and trying to take advantage of people.  For #4 - I just believe that if you're going to raise a kickstarter and say ""this is what we need to release a game"" don't come back to the community 19 months later and say ""You know all those things we promised you?  Well if you want them within a reasonable timeframe we need more of your money""  This is just the impression I have based off of the information I skimmed through."
Cityofheroes,3b41bz,BoldArch,2,Fri Jun 26 22:23:28 2015 UTC,"Just to speak on the development standpoint, building a game from scratch is a very time consuming process. A lot of companies that turn out games every two or three years have the benefit of being able to pull resources from a previously built game.  These guys basically started with nothing other than the Unreal Engine 3 and have sense ported it over to Unreal 4.  I'm also fairly certain that very few (if any) are working on this full time, I know a lot of their talent is voluntary.  The main thing here is the game was public knowledge since before work had even begun on it. Normally MMOs are announced quite a few years after development has commenced. This wasn't really an option for this game."
Cityofheroes,3b41bz,MattTreck,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:33:11 2015 UTC,"The thing about skimming is, you fill in the gaps with what you expect/assume.  I think you'll want to peruse this link before going any further, it contains all our updates organized in a friendly fashion for someone looking over all 100 plus at once. Make sure to note the dates of any you choose to read. You could do worse than to focus on the last four months or so if it's just to establish some context (so start with the highest numbered ones).  http://cityoftitans.com/forum/kickstarter-update-reference-list  Right, that's as much in regards to point one and two as is worth saying before I know you're aware of our latest releases. Well, besides for the development time reality check but somebody else did that already.  For point three, was there some other, more ideal method by which we could possibly have funded such an enterprise without selling ourselves to some other corporation? Different crowdfunding platforms would not change your points any, getting patrons means handing the ultimate game control to somebody else which nobody in the community wants, and the only other way I can see to have met your points would be to have waited another two years to get started. Which I also don't think anybody wants.  As for the new campaign, if you read the update properly instead (that you didn't is your own admission) you'll see it actually says we DON'T need the money. It specifically states that we have 1/3 the KS money left and that we expect a more standard revenue stream to start soon. The new one is literally in response to demand. The KS money has lasted very well, but the sheer number of people demanding a second one for various reasons has been growing ever since the last one ended. And when the new revenue stream goes live, that's it. So we pretty much have to open the door soon (many want a second chance at some of the rewards). And doing it before now would have been too irresponsible. We had to run the KS at the stage we were at, we couldn't move beyond that stage without the funds. Now we have the funds, we waited until things were humming and we had displayable progress (as opposed to progress that is very important but completely un-displayable, very common in game development. We started focusing hard on developing systems rather than graphics. The two are now coming together). It's not going to be a campaign, we're not planning to hype it, we're not going to be getting the attention of the media for it, and we're not even going to use KS this time, we're looking at self run platforms.  MattTreck comments below that companies that turn out games rapidly can pull resources from a previously built game. Valiance is one such example in fact.  They are part of an alliance of game studios who share resources in order to develop faster. They re-skinned another game that had been years in development to get where they are so fast.  -Shadow Elusive, MWM Community Manager"

I was first introduced to this game at 8(2005), and man, were force fields and laser eyes the coolest thing ever!  It was a world of wonders that I sometimes got to glimpse over my dad's shoulder.  When my mom died two years later, City Of Heroes was my haven.  I didn't realize it at the time how much it helped me cope until my irl friends remarked how funny and normal I was in game, compared to the stony, empty way I felt and acted when not playing.  I know there are healthier ways to work through grief, but I also know that this game helped shield me from the crushing grief that almost consumed my father and younger brother, until I was old enough and adjusted enough at school  to truly grieve three years later.    I continued to play in 3 month spurts until the servers shut down, and while I never desired the great camraderie that this game had in overabundance, For me it continued to be a place of calming solace where my imagination could run free."

There was space for it. Golden age, four color heroes? Plenty. Silver Age sleekness? This was the prime space for it. Magic Aliens from the 20th Dimension? I knew a few. Hard boiled detectives?

I did not have a single friend and my mother was completely oblivious to my life(her advice on getting friends was just ""go up and compliment a girl on her sweater"").  I was terribly lonely and gave up hope on life pretty much.  I stopped taking care of myself and pretty much ate myself half to death.  I got angry, I got violent, and started getting in legal issues.    Then, I received the August 2005 edition of Game Informer (or PC Gamer, cant remember) that had a demo disc/free trial for City of Heroes. CoH was literally the game of my dreams.  It was everything to me. I finally found something I felt I belonged in and for the first time in years, I made friends.    Having friends and playing City of Heroes made my life worth living. It was during this time that I learned basic social skills and grew confidence in myself.  Now, I have an amazing job and long-term opportunity at a company I believe in and I have an amazing wife.  I am 100% serious when I say I don't think I would have made it this far if I never found City of Heroes.  I broke down when I read the post informing everyone of the closure on the CoH forums, and I was one of the first people to respond (I think I said something like, ""This can't mean what I think it means...can it!?).

Cityofheroes,3af0v4,speed_boost_this,5,Sun Jun 21 20:40:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah its from the Tequila launcher for Icon.  Icon is the project that lets you fire up the City of Heroes client, muck around with the character creator, enter zones (albeit unpopulated).  Tequila is a launcher for that process and it will go grab updated files to the Icon project when they become available.  (Tequila is actually the name of the PC launcher, I gather the Mac launcher is called Island Rum and presumably that image is displayed there as well).  My guess is the next phase will be fairly basic, a foot in the door of possible CoH offline play, might represent a ton of work from developers behind-the-scenes but to the end user might not look like much so don't get your initial hopes too high.  So far we can enter a zone and.. not really do anything, right?  We can walk around, they hardwired Fly into the 1 key, could look around and take pics.  I'm guessing we could at least see the other travel powers opened up.  If Fly can be triggered then Superspeed, Superjump, and maybe Teleport (it has the weird targeting aspect that might need stuff the other powers dont depend upon).  Maybe self-targeting powers could be turned on, with nothing to target most attacks couldn't be triggered anyways right now but could, say, Blazing Aura be turned on?    Maybe some client-side targets could be hacked in.  Were things like the Rikti War Zone target dummies, were they driven by server-side processes?  Don't know but I wonder if such dummies could be more easily emulated in Icon than a regular critter.  If we had something to shoot at, perhaps most if not all the powers could be enabled?  Again, not alot to do with it even if it is possible but the start of some CoH machinima.  If you don't have CoH installed anymore its easy enough now to get the client back, just go grab Tequila (or Island Rum) here and it'll install the client for you."
Cityofheroes,3af0v4,foundingvaters,6,Sat Jun 20 13:52:35 2015 UTC,"Given the fact that Leandro's post said that they finally decoded the full range of server<->client messages late last year, this new project is the results of a first attempt to implement those new messages.  There was also an indication that there would be a new cohtitan log-in system, so I believe they will be hosting a new, limited server that our clients can connect to.  Codewalker said Icon was a hack and that this new project was NOT a hack.  He did also say that it isn't what we REALLY wanted but something very cool.  Given that we want a full server and experience returned to us, this isn't that.   Also, since it uses the i24 install, but isn't a hack, then I'm guessing it is not a new version of the icon tool (could be wrong here).  I'm guessing it is one of two things:  1) Enough server-side was implemented to allow several people to log in and inhabit the same zone on a common server, and we can run around, have costume contests, go to pocket D and have dance-offs and just turn it into a social tool (for now)  2) Enough was done to make a simple server to allow a single player experience exist in some form (run around, street sweep, using powers and having some enemies attack)  I doubt both exist in this new project and I'm betting it's the first one I mention (icon-like experience, but with zones populated by other players, but no missions, teams, nps arcs, etc), rather an a single-player type experience.  The good news is that both Leandro and Codewalker have indicated that 7 months of hard work are about to be released in the next few weeks. I'm thinking Leandro said this month (June).

Having never listened to the show before, I can't really speak as to how the dynamic of the hosts works, but there were several times I literally said, ""oh screw you"", out loud, at my phone, when one of them that had never played the game opened their mouth and started spewing critique. When they started talking smack about how the soundtrack wasn't a soundtrack because the tracks weren't long enough, or they heaped scorn on the superhero genre as a whole, it just made me want to turn the darned thing off.  I'll probably finish out the episode on the way home just so I can hear the tracks I know and love, but as much as I love game soundtracks in general if the first 20 minutes of it is indicative of what the last half-hour is going to be like, this is one podcast I won't be keeping a subscription to."

I heard rumors that he was scared off by the then-current efforts of MWM to acquire the COH IP, but I don't have any sort of confirmation and rumors are a dime a dozen these days.

Cityofheroes,39fpnj,Felderburg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:50:13 2015 UTC,"You're referring to Titan Icon I assume (if you mean City of Titans, that's another topic)?  Because that is something completely different, and is not a server emulator.  It is the character creator (which was previously available as a standalone program from Cryptic btw, circa Issue 1 or 2 I believe), plus local client data (the maps, textures, etc), but it doesn't emulate the presence of a game server, or the data that would be sent between a server and client.  Note, this isn't meant to take anything away from Titan Icon.  I've logged at least a couple hundred hours in it since Codewalker first released it, and absolutely love that we've got it.  I only post this to point out the fundamental differences between Icon and SEGS.  And yes, I'm aware that the SEGS project isn't really functioning to begin with at the moment.  To be honest, I'm not sure its been up and running since even before CoX was shut down, although I know it was ""working"" at some point prior to that."
Cityofheroes,39fpnj,americanguardian,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:45:55 2015 UTC,"Well, I meant more that any emulator that Titan folks do is going to be current with Issue 23 or 24, rather than SEGS's 4 or whatever."
Cityofheroes,39fpnj,Evets616,2,Wed Jun 17 03:05:05 2015 UTC,"According to the information linked to by LeandroCOH in this thread, the new Titan project is probably going to be out in a few weeks and is not like Icon, which is a hack for the client only, but a limited server that should allow more than Icon did.  While they haven't given out specifics, CodeWalker indicated that it ""..probably not what you REALLY want, but we think it is cool.""  I'm thinking it is just enough of a server to allow multiple people to log in and run around together in the same zone, chat, etc.   Probably no teaming or missions or combat powers yet though.  This would be enough to start to reunite the old community, as the role players could return and we could have costume contests using the new pieces in the i24 client (and yes, the new tool is I24 only).  So, hang in there, we will probably be super-excited by the new tool, as we'll not only be able to be together again (if what I suspect is true) but it could be the foundation for a more complete server to come, which would bring back more of the old gameplay (hopefully).  I just hope they put out the source code for it like they did Icon, however, if they've fully reverse engineered the protocol that might be a touchy subject to expose.  Then again, if they don't release the source, they might end up disappearing and we'd be back to having just Icon again."

Cityofheroes,39fpnj,LeandroCOH,2,Fri Jun 12 09:06:17 2015 UTC,"Most of this work has already been done by Titan. Reverse-engineering the main protocol (the one that dbserver and mapserver use) was a nightmare, but it was finally ""done"" mid-to-late last year. It has been partially implemented and in testing since. The first public release is happening very very soon.  The authserver protocol (that allows a login and sends a list of servers) is much simpler, has already been implemented by others like Infinite Rasa, and is mostly irrelevant for COH. You can make the COH client connect directly to a dbserver, skipping the authserver entirely, and have full functionality. The new Titan project does this, and handles auth separately."

I'm going out on a limb and saying that the new project isn't a full server, so probably no teaming and mission play but maybe a way to let multiple players be in the same instance.  I can see the Virtue RP'ers crowding the dance floor in Pocket D and many new costume contests, but probably not missions or teams or combat at this stage.  Still, it will be exciting to log back in and interact.  Can't wait, I hope it is out soon!"

The last thing I saw about it was a note from Codewalker on the Titan forums back in February (link here).  At that time, there still wasn't much to tell, and if things have changed, I've not seen any evidence of it yet.  As for the plans for if they're successful, I would imagine the newly licensed/owned content would be included in CoT's development, helping to make it a true successor.  And if they're successful in acquiring the code, we could perhaps also see the original game, likely only as far as i23 or i24, be raised from the deep for us to play on again (though it would likely be static, so no continuing updates and such)."

Cityofheroes,38tayh,speed_boost_this,3,Sun Jun 7 00:02:32 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, and hate being put into the position of defending NCSoft, but...  Corporations aren't perfectly rational actors any more than people are, they cannot be because they're ran by irrational people.  We have a tendency to assume smarter behavior from corporations than from people but it doesn't take much looking to see its a false expectation, companies can be every bit as dumb as we are.  On the flip side, you can't just say that closing a profitable game is inherently a dumb idea because there was the possibility of the resources being used for CoH could potentially be put to better user making more money elsewhere.  The same reason you might, say, quit a 60k a year job... to take a 90k a year job elsewhere.  You wouldn't say quitting a job was always, 100% of the time a bad idea, would you?  Not when a better job awaits?  NCSoft presumably decided they were better off doing something besides CoH.  That decision might or might not have paid off, like your new 90k/year job might have fired you or closed down, but the decision itself still might have been a rational one to make at the time.  I gather NCSoft's negotiations with Nexon at the time of CoH's closing made the west-centric game look like resources that could have been better spent shoring up eastern interests.  Profitable or not, companies make such self-defining decisions all the time, if a car parts manufacturing company ends up owning through an acqusition, say, a drycleaning service I wouldn't be surprised at all if they chose to sell off that property, even if its making solid money, simply because its not seen as part of their core business model.    Thats why I don't hold NCSoft's decision against them (not too much), but its also why I'm hopeful they'll reach a rational decision and elect to sell off the drycleaning service they no longer/don't value."

Cityofheroes,37pnzi,XeroDream,9,Fri May 29 16:42:55 2015 UTC,Ooh yes. Loved MMs and especially bots MMs. Always thought the FF secondary for bots was a bit dull tho ;)
Cityofheroes,37pnzi,XeroDream,7,Fri May 29 17:21:43 2015 UTC,"I loved bubbling my little robots. Even in WoW I played a priest for the shields heh. I have always been the type of healer/support who loved shields and absorbs more than just raw healing. Also, there was no greater feeling of awe then when I first summoned my assault bot and watching him wreck stuff, then, he gets the awesome missiles with the upgrade? gg no re."
Cityofheroes,37pnzi,srmalloy,6,Fri May 29 17:32:47 2015 UTC,Oh yeah lvl 32 in a bot MMs life really was a thing of awesome. Incendiary rockets and twin plasma cannons. All kinds of superb!

This was aided by my having built my snipe with increased range, so that when combined with Boost Range she could hit targets out around 260 yards. (LRM Missile maxed at 287 yards, but AoEs would always aggro the survivors.)  Or going out to Peregrine Island and doing the 'don't run, you'll only die tired' schtick with Warhulks, hanging in the air outside of their maximum range and following them around sniping them until they went down.  Back before the Rikti Crash Site became the Rikti War Zone, and the Rikti mothership's force field became a teleport, you could go out and ""ski Rikti mountain"" -- land on the high side of the force field and slide down to the other side of the ship."

Cityofheroes,37pnzi,Q-Kat,3,Fri May 29 20:02:46 2015 UTC,How did you manage teleporting afk's across zones?
Cityofheroes,37pnzi,Q-Kat,5,Sat May 30 01:37:26 2015 UTC,"If you have team TP, or tp other, you can throw them into the zone doors and they would zone for you.  It was all very polite.  Except for the coming back to your toon monster island part."
Cityofheroes,37pnzi,thelefthandN7,2,Sat May 30 03:38:13 2015 UTC,Sadly had to be monster island because hazard zones and the sewers and that popped up confirmation boxes
Cityofheroes,37pnzi,Q-Kat,3,Sat May 30 08:44:46 2015 UTC,You need to be in team and they need to be auto acceting teleport friend. Then when you use the targeting reticle to place them near you you click it into one of the roads to the next zone. You could make your way through to talos island this way then teleport them into the open ferry door to pi then head up to monster island and teleport them onto or above it :)
Cityofheroes,37pnzi,thelefthandN7,3,Sat May 30 08:42:56 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: If you used group TP, they didn't get a chance to say no, Team TP affected everyone in range.  You kind of had to be buffed to get away with it since the power used a lot more endurance and had a shorter range than single TP, but even flyers and other teleporters got dragged along for the ride if you were fast... or happened to bind the teleport buttons to the mouse."

Cityofheroes,37pnzi,OrionSTARB0Y,3,Sat May 30 19:20:45 2015 UTC,"Oh that was the best thing about TT, it never activated the request.  My friend Ren hated that part of it, which of course made it funnier for me.    I always assumed it didn't offer the chance to confirm or deny because of how fast the multiple jumps were.  Also, since the caster was coming along for the ride, they probably thought the potential for trolling was less.  They were wrong, but that's what they probably thought."

I enhanced it with Hami-o's for mez, and used to either throw mobs straight up in the air, or off of buildings.  Then in local I would shout 'It's raining men!'  Since wormhole doesn't cause direct damage, it would leave the mobs with 1hp from fall damage without flagging them as my kills, so others could get full exp.

Cityofheroes,37pnzi,Sablemint,3,Sat May 30 21:23:45 2015 UTC,"Hrmm...tough choice, really.  If I just went by hours spent, base building would top the list by far.  But I also spent a lot of time leading and participating in Rikti Raids, PvP'ing in RV, marketeering, tinkering with my favorite Fire/Kin's builds, and punting Romans off of Romy's wall with my SS/WP.  Given that list to try and choose from, maybe I'll just go with the hours spent and say base building.  Oh, and an honorable mention to skiing, when the hills were open.  I'd spend hours at a time with my Fire/Kin on the hills, sometimes racing, sometimes just chatting and buffing anyone that wanted it as they went by.  I even had a special build for her that I used just for skiing, heh."

Keep an eye on the sister subreddit /r/cityoftitans for what is (imo) the best hope for a spiritual heir to the CoH throne.  Its a rare week that passes without a character concept popping into my mind, instantly followed by a moment of sad realization.  Coupla days back saw a car with ""CATLYST"" license plates, the first thing that came to mind was ""oh, cool name for a minotaur rad defender!""  Now, post screenshots and costume designs! :)"

I've only got to see the word ""City"" written anywhere for example.  Whenever I see anyone talking about ""Anti Virus"" and they call it ""AV"", I always think ""Arch Villain"".  Funniest one happened to me a while back when I was configuring a new network switch for a customer.  My contact on site was this absolute mountain of a fella; 6'7, built like a brick wall and hands like excavator shovels.  He happened to be the General Manager.  When he signed my job sheet, in the position box he wrote ""GM"".  I thought, ""Hmm.. Giant Monster.. I wonder how much XP I'd get for him""."

Fond memories of chatting under Atlas Statue, listening to Rogues Radio.  I often wonder what became of the old faces/regulars, and what they are playing now."
Cityofheroes,37k9s2,borticus,2,Thu May 28 16:16:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'd have been a particularly familiar face - especially towards the end as I tended to mostly play solo or with a small band of friends.  My SG dwindled in regular players and PuG quality got steadily worse.  My main was a Stone / Fire brute called ""Volkanik"".  Started off as a villain, but brought him over to the blue side with Going Rogue and the only character I ever really did anything with on the Incarnate system.  My other favourite was a Bots / Dark MM called CyberDeath.  I had a core of characters that all lived in the same ""universe"" as it were (although ironically, Volk was never really part of that) and CyberD was always the big bad.  There was never any way that I was going to make him a reformed character.  As for what I play now, I dabble here an there.  Currently really enjoying GTA V online and occasionally dip in and out of MechWarrior Online.  Tried CO and DCUO, but neither of them had that depth or replay value of CoH, and both games just felt like a repetitive chore in one way or another."
Cityofheroes,37k9s2,borticus,1 point,Thu May 28 19:09:03 2015 UTC,"Here's something weird. I think I have more screenshots of characters since closing than I took while the game was running.

Cityofheroes,37bo4l,thelefthandN7,12,Wed May 27 11:06:39 2015 UTC,"Is there any other game out there that comes close to the CoH character creator?  I've mucked with the CO creator some and enjoy the breadth of options it has with asymmetrical and tri-color choices but still found it lacked the depth of the CoH creator.  Not enough costume pieces, and many of what it does possess hidden behind a paywall.  I just want a game where the character I create is my character.  I don't want my character to look like generic barbarian #8832.  I don't want my character's looks to be dictated by stat bonuses where the most jarring costume pieces are forced together into a nightmarish fruit cake of design elements.  It still amazes and baffles me that nobody else in the market has popped up to fill this desire.  Close behind costumes, give me power options that are customizable enough, variable enough, that even if I'm playing a en/en blaster just like my teammate we're still different enough to be almost unrecognizable - he is playing a in-your-face blapper and I'm playing a death-from-above hovering knockback-into-knockdown AoEer.  And ""the ground is lava"" superjump :)"

Cityofheroes,37bo4l,3d6,6,Tue May 26 14:04:51 2015 UTC,:[
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,borticus,6,Tue May 26 20:42:51 2015 UTC,"The chiefest thing I think everyone misses about City of Heroes is the costume system. Holy cats was that thing incredible. The very first time I logged in I was completely overwhelmed. I even got tired of scrolling through options - but that's only because I wanted to play the daggone game! But once you got used to where everything was it was a breeze creating something new, or at least knowing what category to find something. Even after all of the expansions and additions and re-jiggering, I did find myself using similar themes and options and pieces more often than others. But I never lost the joy of seeing the amazing things that other people put together.  Speaking of...  How did I forget about Costume Contests? I didn't participate in many over my eight years - usually only in small party themed events for, say, Halloween. You know those, right? Come dressed as your favorite superhero? My favorite time was when I dressed one of my characters as someone else's character, which led to a good friendship with that person.  And that leads me to: The community at large. It's easy enough to fall in with a group of people in an online game or space. Or maybe I've just had good luck with that in my MMO experiences. But when you expand that circle of acquaintences and you keep running into fun, nice, enthusastic people who enjoy the game as much as you do, it's something special. I think that is helped by the size of the CoH community.  One of the greatest quality of life improvements City of Heroes introduced, and no other game has copied, is Super Sidekicking. Heck, sidekicking alone was innovative. But that was tricky on smaller servers, and in order to keep the game's easy and fun quotient high SSK was made. And it was good. Now you could start a brand new character and still hang out with the friends you just made playing in Grandville. (This can also be applied to the Global Chat and Global Handle systems.) That made alting and altitis a key feature. I know plenty of people who had one or fewer max level characters because they enjoyed exploring new costumes and new concepts and new powers. Not many games have that kind of variety.  The mission systems were so many miles ahead of anything before or since. Sure, you may have to make contact with NPCs to get things rolling, but at some poin you do get to phone it in. EVEN IN A GAME WHERE FAST TRAVEL IS A KEY COMPONENT, having to trek back to Doctor Fayte (who is just a talented surgeon and nothing more) could become a chore, especially in the late game where you have to criss cross several zones to do it. And if you didn't like the traidtional contact and story part? Newspapers gave you easy access to all the fun you could handle - and then there's bank protect/rob jobs. And if you didn't like what the dev team offered, you could play around in player created missions. Yet another new and innovative feature brought to you by the geniuses at Paragon Studios.  And I have really touched on the thing I miss in every other game I've tried (save two): Freaking superpowers. Not just BANG POW ZAP stuff, I mean flying, teleporting, jumping. For me, flying is where it was at. I don't even remember the first one I tried. Maybe it was super speed. I do remember not being a fan of teleportation. Man. Travel powers. I hate playing fantasy games now simply because I can't fly. I don't mean ""buy a mount that flies,"" I mean because I can't fly. And all the mounts in other games SUCK ASS. Ugh.  I miss the relationship the community had with the developers. Not perfect and sometimes antagonistic, but it was still unique compared to other MMOs.  I miss the lore. As hodge-podge as it could be in places, it was still great to explore and investigate and pretend you're a part of it.  City of Heroes wasn't perfect, but I loved it anyway."
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,srmalloy,3,Wed May 27 03:40:25 2015 UTC,"And I have really touched on the thing I miss in every other game I've tried (save two): Freaking superpowers. Not just BANG POW ZAP stuff, I mean flying, teleporting, jumping.    CoH is the only MMO I've played where the developers actively worked to make it easier for the players to get around the game world. I've been playing SWTOR, and it continues to drive me up the wall that where I want to go is literally ten meters away, but because there's a wall between here and there, I have to go all the way around in a wide loop, just because I can't jump/fly over the wall (and apparently the concept of a rope and grapnel for anything but pulling enemy mobs to you has never occurred to anyone). And a quarter of the character classes have the ability to jump more than a hundred feet horizontally or vertically -- but only if there is a hostile mob at the other end of the jump; if they don't have someone they can attack, they're doing good to leap six feet. It just feels schizoid."
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,borticus,2,Wed May 27 19:18:37 2015 UTC,"In addition to terrible movement speed (even when using some vehicle), the particular frustration with SWOTOR is NOT BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE with whatever contact you're working for. I mean, I can get on board with ""You need to go to this place to talk to this person (and maybe kill them), in person"" because secrecy or whatever conceit. But COME ON. Why do I need to waste my time walking/running/driving all the way back to your stupid face when you're just going to turn me back around and traipse off to the other corner of this walled garden of a planet.  SWOTOR can be a fun game in an interesting environment but there are so many OLD FASHIONED and frustrating things keeping it from being balls out fun. And because you got my dander up: I hate the character creator. If there's any damn place where you should be able to make your character look however you want, it should be in Star Wars. Definitely have the option to change the look of your gear as you buy/sell/acquire different things, but it should be optional.  GRAAAHG. I want to love that game. As it is I only tolerate it."
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,srmalloy,3,Wed May 27 19:29:10 2015 UTC,"Everquest had gear with stats in it, so when Blizzard created WoW, they had gear with stats in it, and because WoW is so successful, gear with stats in it is clearly the One True WayTM to do gear, right? So you get a transfinite number of gear items to the pattern of [company/world] [generic item label], all with slightly different stats but identical appearance, because it's too much work for the Art department to come up with unique models for all the different variations in stat allocations for gear, and there's nothing beyond a game-mechanics reason why any character can't pick up a blaster pistol lying on a table, point it, and pull the trigger. But it's a level 50 blaster, and its workings are too much for your level 49 mind to comprehend.  The CoH character creator, and the mechanics of how you developed your powers, spoiled me for other MMOs. But because of the ""we must do it the way WoW does it"" preconception among most MMO designers, we get the same tired old ""you are what you wear"" mechanics and a slavish devotion to the 'holy trinity'. Feh. The setting is the only thing keeping SWTOR from slumping into a generic ""WoW in SPACE!!!"" (read that like the 'Pigs in Space' lead-in from the Muppet Show) snoozefest MMO."
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,FlatpointHigh,2,Fri May 29 15:44:03 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more.  In fact though I can appreciate what Blizzard was able to accomplish with WoW I really wish it had never happened or at least wasn't the unassailable juggernaut to which all games much be ridiculously compared.  I mourn the games that never were made because game companies were trying to chase that WoW money.
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,SteelRat70,3,Fri May 29 19:13:29 2015 UTC,"It's this kind of thing that makes CoH stand out.  There are so many elements of it that on their own make the world you're playing in a fun place to be, instead of being designed around just making you stay there for as long as possible, irrespective of whether what you're doing is fun or not.  Unfortunately, all of the other MMOs out there that don't have those  things, simply because they're all following the same tedious formula of all the others."

Want to make a character who disappears into her own cloud effects and never has enough endurance to do anything other than stand around? Spines/Dark.

Everything worked together to give you the complete whole.    And the community.  What other game would you meet someone random, decide to join them in a tf or trial, level their character for them in the AE, then set off adventure with your new friend in tow?  No other game would let you make a group of just completely random people without regard to level?  Or encourage random strangers to hand you piles of money so you were slightly more effective?  It was an amazing community encouraged by an amazing system.    The extras!  A super group base!  How cool is that??  And it was custom!  The PvP areas with their unique powers and histories, the zone histories that you learned about through exploration badges.  And the occasional giant monster.   The villains!  The Freakshow, the Carnival of Shadows, Devouring Earth, even the Skyraiders.  They all had personality and motivation beyond what you find in most games.  And of course, Go. Hunt. Kill Skuls."
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,srmalloy,5,Wed May 27 11:05:07 2015 UTC,"And the community.

No other game would let you make a group of just completely random people without regard to level?  Or encourage random strangers to hand you piles of money so you were slightly more effective?  It was an amazing community encouraged by an amazing system.    This. Leaving out the lack, in other MMOs, of an easy way to pull random people together to go off and do missions without worrying whether you've got the right mix of roles and whether everyone's close enough in level to all get XP and contribute; these were all just supports for the basic premise of the game -- we were heroes. Other MMOs, with their mostly open-world action and group loot, set up an inherently adversarial relationship between players -- if someone else kills the mobs you're after, or ninjas the mission item you need, you have to wait for them to respawn, and everyone in your group is a competitor to get that nifty item that just droppped from the mob you killed. CoH almost completely bypassed all of that -- you enter your mission door, and you know that no one else can take away your mission goals before you get to them, no one can kill the mobs you need to defeat and make you wait for them to respawn, and everyone got their own loot drops without affecting anyone else's. And if the mission you did for one of your teammates matched one that you had, you could take completing their mission as completing yours; you didn't have to run the mission again so you could get credit for having done it after you'd just done it. By taking away the things that put players in conflict with each other, there was no reason for us not to act like heroes, and for the most part that was the way people acted."
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,SteelRat70,2,Wed May 27 18:29:49 2015 UTC,This as well.  I absolutely LOATHE open world games and I really don't understand why people don't like instances for all the reasons you mention.  Although SJ WAS awesome.  Always saw it as a personal challenge to get from one mission door to the next without touching the ground.
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,FlatpointHigh,1 point,Fri May 29 12:18:12 2015 UTC,"Instances with the ability to adjust the difficulty level and scale with group size, as we had in CoH was ground breaking, elegantly implemented, and the definition of fun and challenging.  Couple that with the absence of loot squabbles, and you have MMO Heaven."
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,Almafeta,5,Fri May 29 19:10:51 2015 UTC,"The one thing I miss the most from CoH is the fact that they threw out the DPS/Tank/Healer trinity, and it was instead a Damage/Mod/Control trinity.  Damage could easily take out defenders and corruptors, because they were glass cannons - very powerful, but very weak.  Debuffs could easily take out controllers, because it doesn't matter what you can lock down if you can't hit it or if your effects are weakened, or if they have shields that make it near-impossible to affect.  Control could very easily take out damage, because nobody would go in range of a fire ring'd scrapper or stalker, and your favorite AOE blaster only needed a touch of confusion to become everyone's worst day.  It wasn't about piloting ships of DPS against each other, it was about identifying threats you could neutralize and avoiding things that could take you out."
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,SteelRat70,2,Wed May 27 13:19:17 2015 UTC,And I think that's the one element that really encouraged team play.  Many games sadly make your characters too self sufficient.
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,FlatpointHigh,1 point,Fri May 29 12:16:02 2015 UTC,And it was fun.  Grouping in CoH was just plain fun and rewarding.
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,SteelRat70,3,Fri May 29 19:06:10 2015 UTC,"It's such a shame that nothing has come close to the whole CoH experience. CO has really dull gameplay, and DCUO is good until the end game gear grind. You'd think with the saturation of superhero films something to replace it would have come about; especially in the MMO sphere, but no same old same old tired fantasy tropes.  Looking forward to getting my hands on the successors and particularly keeping my eye on the efforts to bring it back"
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,FlatpointHigh,3,Wed May 27 10:43:11 2015 UTC,I'm stunned at the fact that no other game has really copied all of the amazing features in CoH.  I still haven't found a new MMO to play that comes close to the fun that Paragon Studios provided.    The current multitude of gear based treadmills are the antithesis of fun.
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,SteelRat70,2,Fri May 29 02:26:20 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more.  It was the one thing that spoiled DCUO for me.  Which was a shame, because that game had a large number of CoH like elements which could have made it my new home.  Level 30 in two weeks (!) then the rest of your characters life grinding the same missions over and over again for the next tier of gear before doing it all over again for the next set."
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,SteelRat70,1 point,Fri May 29 12:13:42 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of things I miss about CoH.  Not just the lore, the variety, the sheer quantity of content, the generally friendly community and all the other things we know it had, but the one thing that it really captured best was the sheer visceral feel of the powers.  Sure, the visuals were a little primative in terms of their poly count, but the noises, animations, sounds and everything that accompanied the powers themselves had a .. ""weight"" to them.  It genuinely astounds me that I've never played any other MMO that has that ""feel"" to the characters abilities, regardless of how powerful that they're supposed to be.  Take Stone Melee.  It was the primary set of my main Stone/ Fire brute.  It FELT like you were coating your hands in rock and smashing the bejayzus out of something.  The knock down power with the foot stomp animation (was it Tremor?  I forget) and the two handed over head smash gave great big CRASH! sounds and a bit of screen shake.  Wonderful!  Why has no one else ever done that?  Honestly when I played him as a villain, I used to love doing the bank job missions and go around looking for car parks.  There was a strange sense of immense satisfaction (bordering on the therapeutic) in laying waste to a dozen closely packed cars using those powers.  Even just standing between two with firey aura on!"
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,Leviathan419,1 point,Fri May 29 12:10:09 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad they mentioned the sound effects because it's one of the little things about that game that I absolutely fell in love with. Including the force-field whines (screw you, author :p).  Seriously, whenever the game comes back, I'm gonna log in to get playing, hear sound effects and just have goosebumps all over. I miss this game and the sounds of 20 buffs being applied/active :/"
Cityofheroes,37bo4l,themosquito,1 point,Sun May 31 12:02:17 2015 UTC,"You know one of the ""silliest"" things I miss? The emotes. CoH was my... second MMO, if you count original Guild Wars, and it really spoiled me on emotes. There were easily 30+ emotes of all kinds, and afterwards I've come to realize the ""norm"" is more like 10 or so really basic ones. I've never played another MMO that had great RP emotes like ""drink from a cup"" or ""lean against the wall"", or ""use a jackhammer"" or ""go fishing"" or ""lay on the ground"" or ""sit in a chair and not look stupid doing it""."

We sorta stopped after a while (I'd play it with them again though), and I hear it gets very Pay2Win at late levels. I never got that far.  So if you can forgive all the obnoxious micro-transactions, it's a pretty fun game."
Cityofheroes,36vctu,Leviathan419,3,Fri May 22 18:51:55 2015 UTC,"I decided to buy into the recent Closed Beta #3 of Skyforge, and I actually got a bit of the CoH feel from that game. For one, some classes really remind me of CoH archetypes; the Kineticist looks a LOT like a gravity controller, for example. You can customize your character extensively, including height and body sliders (you can have a pot belly if you want!) so thankfully all the characters look fairly unique. No one-size-fits-all toons like in WoW. The solo quest missions remind me of CoH door missions too, especially some indoor factory maps.  Lastly, very much like CoH, you'll run similar maps over and over while leveling. There's a central hub area then players port to various small zones to quest. It's more of an action game with multiplayer than a true MMO. But I was reminded of CoH more than once while playing it. Open beta should be out sometime this summer. While I wait for that, I've started back up on Star Trek Online, which is another Cryptic game so it reminds me of CoH anyway."
Cityofheroes,36vctu,Vestus65,1 point,Fri May 22 19:03:03 2015 UTC,"Gave Skyforce a look based on your recommendation and must admit I'm tempted to lay down $70 on a preorder right now.  But I've been burned before so going to wait until I can actually give the game a try before handing over money.  I thought Wildstar would be right up my alley, being more of a sci-fi fan than the ubiquitous Tolkien Variant #8662 fantasy setting, but the gameplay was just another WoW clone that leaves me cold.  I did enjoy the gamplay of Guild Wars 2 with the more actiony aspect and Skyforge looks a bit like that, hope the action doesn't render it RPG-elements shallow."
Cityofheroes,36vctu,speed_boost_this,1 point,Sun May 24 04:17:34 2015 UTC,"I only did the $19.99 pack, and that was just because CB #3 was about to start, so I had a good three weeks to check it out. The one thing I didn't like, but which is supposedly being addressed, is the way you start with a choice of only three classes (paladin, cryomancer and Lightbringer - kind of a cleric/support class). It takes a while of gaining skill points and working through a Path of Exile-type skill tree before you unlock the next tier of classes. I wanted to try necromancer and maybe ranger, but it was so slow to unlock them that I stopped (beta progress will be wiped anyway). But it's going to be much quicker to unlock new classes in the final game.  I don't think Skyforge will be anything revolutionary but it does seem to have potential."
Cityofheroes,36vctu,Vestus65,1 point,Sun May 24 05:59:18 2015 UTC,"I've signed up for the beta.  Had heard whispers of it but initially it didn't seem like my cup of tea.

Swtor is great, but I disliked that I had to do EVERY side mission in order to keep pace with the story missions.   My new flavor is Smite, which is a MOBA. It plays from the third person view instead of top down. High learning curve, but incredibly fun. I always get a CoH vibe from it, but maybe cause I want it to be. Also great, it's 100% free, or 40$ gets you all 65 characters plus every character that will ever be released.   Also gonna plug r/Smite, which is a great community and a great help with new players"
Cityofheroes,36vctu,Rumblesnap,2,Sat May 23 02:12:07 2015 UTC,I fell out of the MMO scene after CoX shut down. Nothing else quite satisfied the itch I had for a solid online community it centered around a game that gave you so much creative liberty in making characters and builds. Not many other multiplayer games have really held my interest too long so I've pretty much just been building up and playing through my Steam library.
Cityofheroes,36vctu,kweeche,3,Sun May 24 17:46:11 2015 UTC,"I played WoW for several years. I even left CoH in 09 or 10 for WoW, since all my friends were all playing WoW. It was good and I did enjoy myself, but I really wish I could get back to CoH. I haven't played WoW in over a year. I've got a live in girlfriend now and neither of us want to play WoW again, but I would love to find a decent MMO that both of us could enjoy."
Cityofheroes,36vctu,OrionSTARB0Y,2,Fri May 22 15:00:18 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for a decent superhero MMO, you can't get any better than /r/marvelheroes at this time. DCUO and CO pale in comparison, IMHO. The catch: you don't play as a hero you've created. Think of it as a fusion of Diablo and Marvel Ultimate Alliance."
Cityofheroes,36vctu,SteelRat70,2,Sat May 23 00:40:35 2015 UTC,"It's a bit light on content though isn't.  The story lasted until about level 30, then it's just redoing the same levels on harder difficulties or grinding out levels on those levelless open maps (forget what they're called).  I agree it's fun for a while, but like most games these days it seems to revolve more around selling the lastest cosmetic items than it does giving people new things to actually DO."
Cityofheroes,36vctu,OrionSTARB0Y,0,Wed May 27 11:01:39 2015 UTC,"The story actually continues past the 9 chapters of the main story in the raids, which require you to be level 60 and, in the case of the Genosha/Onslaught raid, may require you to power/gear your character beyond the initial level 60. But yeah, content-wise Gazillion is quite slow on releasing new chapters to the overarching story and relies on players being content with doing the same thing repeatedly with different characters."

Cityofheroes,36vctu,Smokenmonkey10,1 point,Sat May 30 18:02:03 2015 UTC,"I have played neverwinter through and its good, but its semi grindy with the levels and items, but I had fun with it though.   GW2 I played a few hundred hours and it was very fun and had a nice build to the game with a very interesting take on the PvP realm with World v World. Also most of the micro transactions are cosmetic.  I have been playing WoW for around a year and a half now and with 30 days of game time played, I will say it is the best MMO I have personally played since COH. The only downside is the $60 in expansions and the $15 per month. (People who like marketing in games, you can now buy the WoW time with in game currency)  I have also played a little bit of TERA, Champions Online, Rift, ESO(beta), Lord of the rings online, starwars old republic, and DC universe online.  If you want another hero game, I would go with Champions Online, the art style is much more different than COH, but gives you that feel like your playing it a little bit because of the game play.  If you have the money I would say try out WoW, there is so much to do in the game and its had a lot of time to develop into an all round good game.  If you like easy access and creative missions, a good semi good community(from what i have seen), fun world events, and on foot exploration and fast travel then GW2 is for you.   I am about to start the secret world and ESO and play through them when I have the chance."

Cityofheroes,34pvpi,kriegson,18,Sun May 3 14:18:27 2015 UTC,"All this came into its own with the Mission Architect.  I ran a once weekly RP supergroup for many years. By the end, we had been writing and playing our own original content for a complete run from first level to maximum, and doing it with mission difficulties that would give nightmares other good players.  Story arcs and comic covers (photoshopped by team members from screen shots) for more than a hundred issues. A reoccuring cast of villans and reserve members. Hundreds of pages of character descriptons, dialog and plot twists. I still have it all on disk.  What other game ever let you do anything like that? Guild Wars 2 is pretty good with the personal story arc, but it is only a pale shadow. I remember that every Wednesday night I would put one my costume and become Extaordinary. The opening theme still railses the hair on my arms.  I miss the city.  T_T"
Cityofheroes,34pvpi,DeepGreen,5,Sun May 3 16:19:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe its just me but I thought Mission Architect was CoH's undoing. I remember the good times yes, this was to me one of my favorite games of all time. I just remember vividly and look back on the last year or so poorly because all anyone ever wanted to do was farm to max level in those places. They were always packed and if you wanted to do a lowbie Task Force you essentially had to have someone that needed it for the badge or whatever the special things you get for collecting multiple badges was called. (Oh god how have I forgotten what those are called..)"
Cityofheroes,34pvpi,nswa22,3,Mon May 4 14:36:31 2015 UTC,"Accolades.  But I don't think Architect killed CoH, honestly. I liked it."
Cityofheroes,34pvpi,Sunscorcher,2,Mon May 4 21:36:25 2015 UTC,"I can't help but wonder if what you were seeing was less about MA and more about most CoHers not wanting to run the Posi or Synapse TF for the billionth time.    In my experience the big draw near the end of CoH's life was the Death from Below sewer trial, it seemed everyone was running that thing constantly.  I saw most folks running it four times to get the four temporary powers that lasted until the low-20s (or a week).  Run that thing a few times and your character was likely pushing 20 already.  Also, I think folks got into a habit of waiting on the TFs until they rolled around as the Weekly Strike Target.  Why do a Posi this week when next week it would give you merits and an xp bonus?  Were there people who did little but sit around in MA?  Of course.  But I don't think you missed much, these were the sort of people who were previously door-sitting during missions and were AFK for entire TFs."
Cityofheroes,34pvpi,speed_boost_this,2,Tue May 5 00:40:41 2015 UTC,"Accolade badges. Some of them had associated Accolade Powers (like the Crey CBX-9 Pistol).  Players who farmed to max level for PVP or ""end game content"" were literally playing a different game than I was. I played 1 to 50 a bunch of times over with a RP group.  The ""Incarnate"" system blew chunks. It encouraged players to replay raids for loot and grind reputation with their main rather than enjoy the journey. I saw a real shift in the types of players (a lot of ex WoW players) and many of them did not stick around as long, in my experience.  Farming Mission Architect to hit Incarnate ""end game content"" harder was a perfectly valid way of skipping all the fluff and getting to 'the real game'. It really split the players."
Cityofheroes,34pvpi,DeepGreen,3,Tue May 5 23:54:25 2015 UTC,This is the thing. It just seemed as though people stopped playing the main content and specific zones became ghost lands. It was a shame in my opinion. I don't mind power leveling or any of that occasionally but it seemed to take away from the game for me personally.
Cityofheroes,34pvpi,nswa22,1 point,Wed May 6 00:00:42 2015 UTC,"Guild Wars 2 living world has gotten a lot better, but yes... nothing will ever compare to CoX's mission architect.

Their own, personalized, creative bio.  Whether the player went for funny, dramatic, or whatever, these were clearly labors of love that people put time into and really added to the personalized feel of each character. Lots of supergroups wouldn't even interview you if you didn't have one, at least on RP servers.  You could also see all the badges they had earned, if you tabbed over. from exploration to Go-hunt-kill-skuls.  I have yet to see another MMO that does this and I would wayyyy rather see that than their freakin equipment.  At least at first glance."

Cityofheroes,34pvpi,a_gunbird,6,Mon May 4 04:04:57 2015 UTC,There was literally no limit to what people would create. Comic books. Real History. Characters from your favorite novels. Television.

Cityofheroes,34pvpi,Dedli,12,Mon May 4 12:42:51 2015 UTC,"That was the best thing about the game.  Every single decision was made with the intent of making you, the player, feel like you're a comic book superhero/villain first over everything else.  Costumes, powers, and even your own optional (totally not optional) backstory kept your character from being just a spreadsheet.  You weren't ""a claws/dark scrapper following popular build X,"" you were, I dunno, ""SAVAGE SPECTER, THE VENGEFUL SPIRIT OF A TIGER SHAMAN"" or something crazy like that, and everything about the game was built around making you more than able to be seen that way.  Combat, while not any sort of intricate puzzle by any stretch of the imagination, was so carefully crafted to make sure every single thing any character did was unique looking in the middle of a big fight.  City zones were memorable, with giant landmarks to orient yourself with, and the new perspective you would get the very first time you turned on your travel power was magnificent.  Hell, I still remember hoofing it around Steel Canyon, back and forth between the middle and south part of the city before finally hitting 14 and being able to zip past all those streets in the air.  You're exactly right about the agency the game gave you to not just play it however you want, but to actually become a recognizable figure in the game's world.  Passing NPCs would casually mention the names of heroes who had just completed important missions, often to other players.  A friend of mine who plays WoW was gushing about this feature being added to that game last year.  No other MMO I've played has ever managed to really get that right, and that's why I just don't play any anymore.  That aspect became so important to me that not having the game treat my character like an actual character ends up being a big turn-off."
Cityofheroes,34pvpi,a_gunbird,6,Sun May 3 15:15:51 2015 UTC,No other game I have ever played has had combat that was just as much fun. That's the best way to describe it; just plain fun.

That's why i consider myself  an ex veteran player even tho i never had the opportunity to test it, i was always on the look for videos and information about this game.   I think i kinda had my city of heroes fix with Champions Online and DCUO but i know it's just not the same..."

The only thing I'd say against the set was the sheer amount of knockback could be frustrating when teaming with meleers.  I'd self-censor - Hurricane, Tornado, even Gale would only be brought out when all heck hit the fan.  But when I let this ice/storm 'troller off his leash he was the most effective controller I had in my harem of alts.  How did Storm play as a primary on 'fenders?  Did it hold up to other fender primaries?"

Can't find a link to the announcement on their website so here is a copy of the email text:   Howdy, folks. This is your ever-lovin’ Warcabbit coming at you a little early this week, with a really short note.  Why? Because there’s some stuff you don’t want to miss. First, tomorrow, the 28th, MassivelyOP are going to run a little editorial I wrote about making your own fun when you play a game. One of our staff at Missing Worlds Media backed their kickstarter out of their own, personal, day-job money, and gave me the editorial to write.   And for that, I thank you, SpaceMoose.   Secondly, I’m going to be hanging out in the comments for that article all day, and you can Ask Me Anything. I might not answer, and I might say ‘I can’t talk about that yet’, but I’ll do my very best to keep up and tell you all I can.  Thirdly, everyone registered on the forums at http://www.cityoftitans.com by Midnight Pacific, on the 28th, will get Badge 11.  It’s the least I can do to thank you guys for sticking with us.  Oh. And… don’t miss the next Kickstarter Update. It’s gonna be a big one.   And it's coming this week.  I think you’ll like it."

Cityofheroes,348e3l,speed_boost_this,3,Wed Apr 29 16:43:48 2015 UTC,"After a few nerfs to the Regeneration secondary, I decided to leave City of Heroes.   Man, early regen players were ironically thin-skinned ;)  I must admit to not owning a regenner until after the nerfs.  Had a friend with one who I played a coupla times on his account and that powerset... lets be honest, regen needed a nerf compared to all the other scrapper powersets, it was way too good, regen scrappers were overshadowing some tanker armor sets.  And no, the answer wasn't to bring all other scrapper armors up to regen's level as then you'd have the entire scrapper class stepping on tankers' toes, which would require that whole class to get a revamp.  From a dev time-efficiency standpoint, they could either tweak the single regen powerset or two whole classes, they chose the wiser option.  I feel for you early regenners, I really do - good reason or no, having your character's performance shift that drastically under your feet couldn't have been fun.  But others were suffering your same pain already, I couldn't get on a team with an early SR scrapper because the powerset was so bad, not even compared to regen but to other ""regular"" scrapper armorsets, +2 bosses on a full team carved through SR like it wasn't there, I'd admire the floor until the team leader would kick me for ""another regen"".    And again, lets be honest - regen still ended up one of the better scrapper armorsets even after the nerfs.  With some IOing it went right back to crazy-good, too."
Cityofheroes,348e3l,a_gunbird,4,Wed Apr 29 20:05:41 2015 UTC,"I always respected people who took the step-child secondaries - Dark Armor and Super Reflexes. Those were the sets that had a very long maturity arc. Even by the end of the game SR was a tough set to level. Well, at least for me and my mediocre self. It wasn't until I had all the powers with a couple of slots that it started to come together for me.  I can't really argue on whether or not Regen needed a nerf. The devs could forget more data than I would ever see. From just my perspective, I was doing ""just okay"" with it. I spent plenty of time on the floor counting dust bunnies so I never felt so all powerful as other people claimed."
Cityofheroes,348e3l,speed_boost_this,3,Wed Apr 29 22:56:33 2015 UTC,"My dad rolled with a MA/SR scrapper from day 1 and the only trouble he'd ever get into was if something finally broke through his mez resist and dropped all his toggles.  SR worked and was often overlooked in the same way forcefields did - not getting hit at all is usually better than being able to heal damage taken.  As far as the regen nerf, I always felt that the biggest part of it was Instant Healing no longer being a toggle.  That was probably the biggest power spike of any set at the time, and if you slotted yourself right you could pretty much drop down to 1 hp and have most of it back before you remembered where you put those green inspirations.  (And if you want to talk about overlooked builds, I was an elec/elec blaster back when all anyone cared about was fire's DPS.  Damn, did I make it work though.  Ever see an archvillain lose all their endurance in 45 seconds?)"
Cityofheroes,348e3l,srmalloy,3,Thu Apr 30 04:59:15 2015 UTC,"Once I got my MA/SR into the 30s, it was amazing. Maybe not my personal favorite but definitely one of the top 5. And that's before I pop Elude. Once I got over whatever my problem with SR was, I made, like, three or four more."
Cityofheroes,348e3l,speed_boost_this,3,Thu Apr 30 05:12:04 2015 UTC,"Early SR was ok for soloing but it did not team well because the way critter accuracy scaled.  Running with an 8-man team, +2 bosses effectively ignored SR defenses.    The scaling was eventually tweaked which greatly aided SR.  Then IOs hit and the powerset experienced a sea change, all those little defense set bonuses that didn't amount to much for non-DEF-based armors added up real quick for SR, it was trivially easy to get SR to the 45% DEF softcap.  Dodging 95% of attacks that come your way is huge!  Oh, plenty of powersets benefited greatly from IOing but SR was so readily improved from set bonuses that they were an early horse out of the IOing gate.  I had a coupla SRs who dropped the Elude power because it became redundant, the temporary softcap it provided was already in place permanently.  Thats how good IOing SRs was. SR probably needed a balance passing itself near the end of CoH's life but so much of its strength was intricately tied to how the game handled accuracy that I'm not sure the devs would have ever got around to it, the set was so binary in nature it was always going to be either underperforming or overperforming and I suspect the devs simply allowed for the once-underdog to overperform at the end."
Cityofheroes,348e3l,Phobos1986,2,Thu Apr 30 11:33:47 2015 UTC,"lets be honest, regen needed a nerf compared to all the other scrapper powersets, it was way too good, regen scrappers were overshadowing some tanker armor sets.   This was so true.  I remember in a TF, facing an ambush for my entire party, because the tank was rushing for the next mish.  The tank was also my mentor, and I was able to keep tanking after he flew out of SK range.  I was level 30 tanking an 8-man spawn of level 35s.    Fun as anything, trying to hold aggro with damage alone."
Cityofheroes,348e3l,Piratica,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:10:05 2015 UTC,"And again, lets be honest - regen still ended up one of the better scrapper armorsets even after the nerfs. With some IOing it went right back to crazy-good, too.   I liked Regen in its original incarnation because of the 'fire and forget' nature once you were able to slot Instant Healing to leave it running all the time; it was an interesting set to play, because you knew going into a fight that your HP would be tanking almost immediately, and it was a race to reduce the incoming DPS below your regen rate before you ran out of HP. You learned how to judge a spawn based on its makeup whether you'd be able to take it or not. But because, by the end of the fight, you'd be essentially back to full health, it always looked like you were overpowered -- but people didn't see the part of the fight where you were down at 10% or less, and could be taken down by a single crit at the wrong time.  Willpower became its replacement for me; it didn't have the same 'dancing on the lip' feel that Regen did, but it was a solid defense set that you didn't have to micromanage."

I remember reading somewhere that a big part of why the deals to get the rights have been so troublesome is that they needed to be approached in a very specific way (You needed a mutual successful business friend to casually introduce both parties who has no direct relation to either party in relation to what sort of deal you were making or something like that so you couldn't just knock on their doors and ask), talks needed to happen under very specific circumstances, and they had to inch forward on every part because that part of NCsoft abided by cultural tendencies.  Basically they really like tradition, and if that means doing ten circles and clapping your hands like a seal before offering a new number when trying to agree on a price then who ever is trying to get CoH is at the mercy of doing that."

The attempt to buy the IP and code away from NCsoft is going to have to work through the process the way it would be done between NCsoft and another Korean business, with all of the slow, careful feeling out of where a decision can be reached in order to avoid a situation where one side or the other loses face in the process."

Just be sure its not already been asked and answered.  Having said that, gotta admit to not having a whole heckuva lot of interest in CoHian lore myself.  Its mildly interesting but for me the CoH world was a personal sandbox for my own creations to play within, not to become overly focused on the story behind someone else's toys.  My characters fought mobsters and mages and zombies more than they fought the Family, Circle of Thorns, and Vahzilok, if you get my drift.    (Guess that's why the epic ATs, especially the heroic ATs, never did much for me.  Take a game that is beloved for its highly customizable costume creator then make a new class that has you spending the vast majority of your time looking exactly like everyone else's character.  Not a great idea in retrospect.)    And in all fairness, the CoH Lore was... fragmented at times.  One dev would be gung-ho about a certain storyline, that dev would move on, the storyline would become abandoned.  Understandable - new devs want to tell their own stories not mimic the stories of those who came before them, and if you're a comicbook fan as well (as I am) then you're familiar with writers being changed mid-arc in that medium as well.  But reasonable or no, it did make following the CoH Lore a bit of a challenge."

Cityofheroes,3418cu,borticus,3,Mon Apr 27 20:03:21 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I sort of adapted CoH lore into my creations. I know my hero had real beef with the Freakshow and later Nemesis, and a tenuous relationship with the Warriors and Tsoo. I agree that I liked that they were a bit cliche, for the sake of adapting them to your story, but I thought the CoH lore did a good enough job for an MMO: create characters that are recognizable and marketable, create enemies that are iconic such that they resonate with players, and create arcs that never truly resolve such that players stay interested (which is eerily comic-book-y...)."

Cityofheroes,33mmaj,borticus,5,Thu Apr 23 19:23:24 2015 UTC,"I was not a power builder.   This is what my Tanker, Alexa Strong looked like.  To explain: Most of the enhancements are the Single Origin type. My general, normal build, philosophy was to make each power as utilitarian as possible. For offense, one endurance reduction, two accuracy, two damage and one recharge reduction enhancement. Where I had the space in the build I would maximize the ability of powers that could only use one or two types of enhancements.  Two of my favorite crafted enhancements were the ones that had procs. In Taunt there is Perfect Zinger. Randomly when a target is taunted there will be a small psi-damage proc. I loved it because at max level I could wander around Atlas taunting groups of Skulls and inevitably one of them would be defeated by the proc. The other proc is in Laser Beam Eyes - Achilles' Heel. It would apply a damage resistance debuff to the target randomly."

Cityofheroes,33mmaj,Vienna_The_Aeronaut,6,Thu Apr 23 23:37:44 2015 UTC,"First off: Get yourself Mids Hero Builder. I love playing around with it every now and then, listen to a youtube video or some music when you're having a quiet night or need to wait ten minutes. Lets you play around with build concepts and see what the enhancements did to your toon's potential.  Basically enhancements take the place of unique armour and loot that other mmos have so for me that meant having the shiniest, silliest things. I'd slot secondary effects all day every day, blasters that could stun on half their abilities, adding knockdowns to AoE DoTs like Full Auto just so I could pretend I am part of an 80's action movie with that gun.   Now I wasn't into the deepend of the character building, but I did have my stonetank. I was god damn invulnerable because I poured stat after stat into him through the invention enhancements. Sure your characters could work well without them but they were basically the only way to surpass level 50 before they came out with the whole incarnate thing. You could do some really interesting stuff too. My stone tank had 100HP Per second regen, maxed out HP pool when Earth's Embrace was up, 40% defences on everything except psionics, and maxed resistances on everything except psionic by focusing as much as I could into pure stats. Of course the guy couldn't deal damage but he was a team player for sure.   Crafting...worked. But it was boring at the end of the day. All it did was make you a bit excited when you got a rare drop but half the time you would farm up so much influence hoping to get drops that you could outright buy five more once you do get them at wentworth's. Unless it was for a super rare recipe, then you were doomed to farm for days and days. The actual act of crafting stuff was uneventful, I kind of wish it had some sort of minigame to make the stuff but making the actual crafting part unreliable/possible to fail would be a terrible idea. For what they were aiming for it worked, but it was a very basic function imo.   One thing I didn't like about the system was how a lot of the enhancement differences (especially origin enhancements) were ultimately very arbitrary. It made no actual difference to the enhancement itself if it was magic or mutation and that ended up being a meaningless restriction. They were so readily available that trading with people who have different origins to get yours was kind of pointless unless you were roleplaying a ""Never buy a single item from vendors ever"" character. Gameplay or artistically wise, there was nothing they could realistically do without overhauling the entire system. You can't make the enhancements visually effect the powers because that defeats the whole purpose of having your hero look however you want separate from the equipment you have, and you can't start giving each origin specialities because then that forces every single blaster to go technology to get the best damage enhancements or whatever.   Another thing I would have liked to see is enhancements that dramatically change the way a power works. Like, turning the Nova ability from energy blast from a PBAoE into a single target nuke and modifying how much damage is done so you can't clear a huge mob with it but you can burst the ever living shit out of one target.  Or changing a heal when you can also cast it on an enemy to deal half the heal's value in damage but it goes on a different (Possibly longer) cooldown. Just fun and very unique changes that directly alter the way a kit works. But this would have probably also been very hard to balance without ending up with other powersets losing their identity since ""X Powerset can do what Y does but with more/better once you get these enhancements""   Well if I let myself go on I could probably end up writing a short story. I did enjoy enhancements as an alternative to traditional loot, it meant you could have optimized stats, hardly any stats at all, or a silly and barely functional (Or extremely functional when it really shouldn't be) build and still retain your own unique look with your character model. That was an incredibly smart move for the time, especially since WoW was basically the only model to go off. They were fun to dip my toes into the real numbercrunching parts of it and they were fun to just play around with."
Cityofheroes,33mmaj,Mgas95,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:34:20 2015 UTC,"Another thing I would have liked to see is enhancements that dramatically change the way a power works.   I wouldn't say it changed powers dramatically, but Overwhelming Force's KB to KD was uber useful. Using it on a power like Shockwave or Energy Torrent was great. It seems like they might have planned to do more things like that down the line."
Cityofheroes,33mmaj,Vienna_The_Aeronaut,2,Fri Apr 24 01:50:18 2015 UTC,"It was definitely a step in the direction I was hoping to see, but then again KB was infamous for being just a complete annoyance come lategame when you have tanks and lockdown all over the place so I saw that as just a way of buffing some powersets where their knockback was actually a hindrance, opposed to an invention set designed to overhaul an ability."

Cityofheroes,33mmaj,mdegar,4,Fri Apr 24 11:32:29 2015 UTC,"Enhancements were what diversified the game passed powers chosen, the standard build was take most powers in primary and secondary, one powerpool, and one ancillary. The significance of enhancements -  specifically Invention Origin - was that even if two people chose the exactly same powers, their characters could play completely differently.  The big change to how people enhanced came with the introduction of Enhancement Diversification. ED essentially only allowed 3 of one type of enhancement per power because after 3 the effectiveness of adding another was onyl about a 1-2% increase. Although many were against it, I think it made for more creative builds that did not just six slot attacks with damage.  Once IOing was introduced it became the focus of the ""meta."" People were able to create blasters who acted like scrappers (AKA Blappers), Controllers with perma decoys and who could take down Giant Monsters, and more. IOing worked by giving regulars stat boosts and additional base stat boosts from having multiple enhancements from a set. This allowed for builds to focus on things like Recharge, Defense, Damage, Endurance, etc."

With later power boosts coming in the Incarnate system, I went from a powerful support character into one that could stand its own against very tough foes.  My other characters often became the MVP of their team, all because of my hard work at obtaining the build I spent hours if not days planning and knowing how to maximize its potential. Creating good builds mattered and wasn't something anyone could just jump in and do without knowledge, and most importantly it was fun. Fun because you had those ""Perma-hasten"", ""soft capped defenses"" milestones among others while creating builds, and the more milestones you achieved the better your build became. You couldn't just reach those goals by grinding, you had to think and plan ahead. And that's what made it so great."

Cityofheroes,33i24k,FlatpointHigh,4,Sun May 24 04:39:47 2015 UTC,"I miss the civilians. Sure, they didn't do much, but it felt so gratifying compared to other MMOs to have a city with what felt like an appropriate population size. It felt good when they ran up to thank you; just adding that little bit of dialogue was all it took to validate those small encounters for me."
Cityofheroes,33i24k,BroGriffington,5,Thu Apr 23 14:06:40 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was neat how sometimes you'd clear a mission and civilians would talk about it. You'd be talking to a contact or something and a nearby NPC would be like ""Did you hear about how Captain Heroguy stopped that nuke?"""
Cityofheroes,33i24k,samfivedot,4,Thu Apr 23 14:47:31 2015 UTC,"This is so valid!  That said, I think GW2 does a decent job of this inside the cities, but the mobs outside the main areas are kind of sporadic.  CoX did a good job with this - I'm thinking of all the mobs at the top of Cap au Diable and similar"
Cityofheroes,33i24k,srmalloy,3,Thu Apr 23 14:44:50 2015 UTC,"I miss the civilians.   Even though they were mostly window dressing, the fact that some of them would actively interact with you after rescue, or just respond when clicked on (i.e., tell you what the server time was, or how long you'd been playing); with SWTOR, the vast majority of the 'friendly' NPCs are purely window dressing -- you can walk right through them, you can't click on them, and they don't respond to you in any way; they're just backdrop to keep the world from being empty without other players in view, and don't even do a good job at acting like background individuals."

Cityofheroes,33c4f5,Nightsjester,4,Tue Apr 21 09:14:16 2015 UTC,"This.  After F2P came back out, AE was still there for farming, but you could easily find groups ready for Radio Missions.  And there were badge hunters available for TFs too.    It was great, as an altoholic, you could play the 1-50 game again with fun pick up groups.  The increase in new powersets from the F2P model meant a lot of people were leveling all the time."

Cityofheroes,33c4f5,Apologies_Eh,7,Tue Apr 21 13:00:15 2015 UTC,"Oh my gosh. Absolutely! But:   ...make it so that players earn way less xp than you get for running game content missions. Make it so that AE rewards content creation more than it rewards playing through AE content.  With neat goodies like titles, cool supergroup base furniture or extra AE options. People who play through AE missions can get rare inspiration and enhancement drops, recipes for costume parts. And of course, good titles.  I really liked the creative part of AE.  A lot. What other medium can you do this in? Besides being a D & D dungeon-master?  You got to be a game designer for goodness' sake.  Went on some downright awesome missions in AE that were obviously labors of love for the creators. Also made some myself that I was quite proud of. In latter days I would stand in Atlas and summon teams on desperate missions to rout out vampire nests! or to stop cells of superpowered terrorists!  Usually got great applause and thanks from the people who took me up on it, after we finished the mission. They were ""well-reviewed"" with lots of stars from players but that wasn't as important as how much people got into it and roleplayed.  Building and balancing those missions and getting kudos from other players was one of the most fun and rewarding aspects of COH. They were great for telling stories and also perfect venues for fun roleplaying possibilities. That is what a mission design feature in an MMO should be ALL ABOUT. Not powerleveling. Lame lame lame.  RIP Victory Maiden on Virtue server."
Cityofheroes,33c4f5,kweeche,2,Tue Apr 21 17:37:07 2015 UTC,"Great reply. I wish I could kill some vampire nests with you now. That's what I wanted AE to be like, but it was tough to find groups like the ones that you ran. The adventure should be fun, regardless of xp/min."
Cityofheroes,33c4f5,Sunscorcher,5,Tue Apr 21 21:22:12 2015 UTC,"It never bothered me. I never played around with the custom stuff. People are going to find a way to get to the top level in any game. The journey is far more fun to me. When I hit 50 in CoH it felt like I had done something. I really enjoyed it. I do wish I could run around Talos Island or Steel Canyon again. Actually, I wish I could fly around instead of run."
Cityofheroes,33c4f5,kweeche,5,Tue Apr 21 13:24:50 2015 UTC,"You can fly around, if you still have the game installed. You can access the costume creator and fly around the maps, but you cannot interact with anything or anyone, and no mobs will spawn. It really just feels like a tease."
Cityofheroes,33c4f5,Steelhelm2004,5,Tue Apr 21 15:15:14 2015 UTC,"I no longer have the game installed. :( I've tried Champions and DC Online, but they felt ... cheap."
Cityofheroes,33c4f5,Novalisk,5,Tue Apr 21 16:21:37 2015 UTC,"AE was super fun for me. I would definitely want to use it. However, that's not because of the farming xp thing. It was the storytelling. Making good story arcs in AE was one of the best things CoH had, IMO."
Cityofheroes,33c4f5,Mgas95,2,Tue Apr 21 17:19:13 2015 UTC,"The +5% health accolade you got from running the sub-50 task force chain, along with the task force token rewards kept me from doing too much powerleveling at once. They also added the double xp bar for non-AE content, which motivated people out of the AE building for a bit.  Powerleveling is fine as long as you still actually play with your character from time to time."
Cityofheroes,33c4f5,crossedx,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:09:41 2015 UTC,"PLing, IMO, is intended for players who have already played through most of the content (because let's be real no one played ALL OF IT) and wanted to test out a new build starting from a specific level. For example, Stone Armor only really became good  after granite armor because its other defenses were fairly shitty; so PLing my character to 32 and starting from there would have been not so terrible."

Cityofheroes,33c4f5,Atomens,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:04:52 2015 UTC,"Div sucked when it first came out, but once the purple sets came out it more than made up for it. You couldn't min max as hard, but with the set bonuses you had a much more rounded toon, that felt more powerful in mishes."
Cityofheroes,33c4f5,speed_boost_this,2,Tue Apr 21 20:13:52 2015 UTC,"I feel like everyone is going to disagree with me, but the only way I'd want AE to be there is if it granted no XP.   I'd also want the level 14 requirement to come back for travel powers.   Hollows would become the main leveling method after sewers again. Everybody loved doing Hollows without travel powers, right?"

Cityofheroes,33c4f5,nofuture09,2,Wed Apr 22 06:35:36 2015 UTC,"People who whine about AE over power leveling, or people who try to ruin it for everyone else to stop power leveling are the reason we can't have nice things. Using a normal CoH mission on +3 x8 you could power leveling a character to level 50 in a single day. You didn't need AE, you literally just played the game in the same mission over and over for EXP. Nerfing AE to stop power leveling, or nerfing anything else new and fun to stop people from power leveling is just ruining it for everyone else. People also act high and mighty because they weren't power leveled, I've seen people who played from 1-50 on their own and were still clueless and terrible in teams. Stop whining about Power leveling, It's been there since day 1 and people have gotten by fine ever since.  Don't get me wrong, They should obviously fix glitches and bugs that instantly level you, but nerfing something to give little to no EXP just so people can't conveniently power level is childish."
Cityofheroes,33c4f5,Mgas95,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:25:42 2015 UTC,"I dunno, never saw a drop in player participation from AE's arrival but I did have an awesome SG so perhaps it was that shielding me from the larger spectacle.  Power levelers will power level.  Does it really matter to you if folks replace door-sitting with running AE farms?  Actually, isn't shooing off door-sitters to AE preferable to their leeching off a team wanting to play?  I would want AE back, and I'd want it with ""real"" awards.  Between making the feature too attractive and non-attractive, the way to go is the former IMO.  Not that some happy medium couldn't be found, the offering needed some additional tweaks to prevent rampant abuse but it was hugely better by the end than when it launched.  There was no call for giving out XP for critters that could not fight back at all, for example.    But if someone works up a mission full of fire-using critters and wants to take their fire tank in there and wipe them out en masse, so be it.  The game had a max-xp cap in place, such optimized missions by definition fell within the devs' accepted leveling ranges so no harm no foul.  Full Disclosure: I made storytelling arcs and I made leveling arcs.  I didn't even consider it ""powerleveling"" as I never employed any of the abusive methods.  Just make a mission that spawned a ton of critters, give them a self-rez, and take an AoE brute in there for optimized mayhem.  optimal killrate <> powerleveling.  And after having dozens of L50s in the harem I just didn't see any harm in getting some new alts to L20 before playing them, the only thing I was denying myself was content I'd ran dozens of times before."
Cityofheroes,33c4f5,DokerinZion,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:33:52 2015 UTC,"I don't care about AE.  I never really played with it.  Once I found out that it was impossible to set a hostage to lead out in the back of outdoor maps, kind of defeated the purpose of my story.  So I can take it or leave it.

Which some accredit to the downfall of CoH because it:    Allowed people to quickly farm to 50 with various mob exploits (Rikti monkeys, Rikti Communication Officers) Tanked the market with people buying rare salvage with tickets and selling it for INF.

Cityofheroes,33c4f5,luminaeus,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:34:34 2015 UTC,"Not in the form it was in. Maybe outside the primary reward structure. It annoyed me more than I benefitted from it.   The thing that bothered me about AE was that you got inf (infamy/influence/information) from the missions. As I understood the explanation, inf represented your ability to get others to do things for you, either out of respect for the things you've done (blueside), fear of what you've proven yourself capable of doing (redside), or for a share of the dirty secrets you've collected (goldside). I can see where AE missions would earn you experience; you're learning how to use your powers more effectively, just as you would learn to shoot a gun better on a range or combat course. And the AE-specific ticket rewards are part of AE; it can pass out whatever in-house rewards it wants. But I never understood how crawling into your electronic navel affected your reputation back in the real world. You could go into the AE building at level 1 and come out level 50, and the average person on the street wouldn't have any idea who you were; you'd never done anything to make a name for yourself publicly."
Cityofheroes,33c4f5,gruegirl,1 point,Sun May 24 04:06:51 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would want to see mission architect in the game if (hopefully when) it comes back.

Additionally, you can check out Valiance Online which is in open pre-alpha, and just got through Steam Greenlight. They have a bunch of gameplay and test enviorments here. From what is playable of the pre-alpha it has a very similar feeling to CoH; their previous test zone was almost identical to Atlas Park, which was cool.   Don't even bother with looking up Heroes and Villains (the third spiritual successor). They have been all talk, and although they write weekly updates almost nothing has actually been shown."
Cityofheroes,325suq,Mgas95,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:08:06 2015 UTC,Do you know more of the story and controversy surrounding Heroes and Villains? Been trying to find that out.
Cityofheroes,325suq,BoldArch,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:11:01 2015 UTC,"From what I understand:  HaV is led by Golden Girl, a very opinionated member of the community who many people found toxic. She started working on HaV and left CoT (still referring to itself as just The Phoenix Project) because of creative differences.   After the announcement of Valiance, Golden Girl was convinced that they were a scam and that they would funnel funds raised for the game into development for other games; she went on to spread these claims throughout the community. when they turned out to be false the community excommunicated her. Although she posted an apology to VO, the damage was done and they had started off with a bad name.   Ironically though, VO actually has a playable pre-alpha while HaV has nothing except for concept art and a lackluster video posted almost 2 years ago."
Cityofheroes,325suq,Mgas95,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:20:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you!, so THAT'S what the rumor mill thing regarding VO was about....  What were some of Golden Girls views?  I remember her posting to virtually every thread on the forums but don't remember the context."
Cityofheroes,325suq,BoldArch,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:46:39 2015 UTC,"Not so sure, from what I can find she is against crowdfunding (which was used by both CoT and VO). I was never active enough on the forums to really know, but even before the controversy I recognized her name."
Cityofheroes,325suq,Mgas95,1 point,Wed Apr 15 22:25:42 2015 UTC,"Golden Girl was very much a ""my way or else"" kind of person. Morality was 100% black & white to the point of absurdity in her mind (and playing as a villain was as bad as being a bad person in real life). And even in situations where a Lawful Stupid Paladin would be unsure how to proceed, her interpretation was the only feasible one. It was absurd.  Additionally, in a game like City of Heroes, she played MA/Regen Scrappers. And that is quite literally the ONLY thing she played. Dozens of them. I don't necessarily want to accuse someone of playing ""wrong"" but in this case, I'm tempted to do so. She was one of the most vocal opponents against set proliferation because she wanted her MA/Regen to stay a Scrapper ""thing"".  Also? One of the biggest annoyances related to her was that she would always hint like she ""knew"" stuff the developers were working on but hadn't shared yet. She would drop nonsensically-vague hints about things the developers might be doing in speculation threads or anywhere that might be even tangentially related to her lies. Those ""hints"" were always JUST nonspecific enough to keep her from getting called on her bullshit directly, even if it was obvious to anyone with a brain.  The only way to really respond to her was to block and ignore her. Unfortunately, you'd still see her shit indirectly because of people that WOULDN'T block her and quote her garbage. Disagreeing with her on even the most mundane shit was tantamount to heresy and blasphemy (her views on crowdfunding in regards to CoT were pretty outspoken).    As a bonus, I'll give a embellished demonstration of how she would post in response to someone:   What were some of Golden Girls views? I remember her posting to virtually every thread on the forums but don't remember the context.   ""If only you weren't such a lesser person to not know who I am. ;D"" ""Well, my views are the only correct ones, so you should know you're wrong for not knowing them. ;D"" ""What I've been claiming has been disputed, time and again, by facts straight from the developers? Well, it's just my opinion. ;D""  The hostility wouldn't be quite as blatant as I'm portraying but she would constantly write the most barely-concealed toxic crap, punctuated by her signature ;D emoticon. Plausible deniability from moderation or something. Though it obviously worked since I never once saw her get punished for the shitstorms she would cause from her trolling."

Cityofheroes,308jjf,thelefthandN7,3,Wed Mar 25 10:58:46 2015 UTC,"Hah thx. I mainly played CoV. He was the melee class that uses stealth, cant remember the name. But he was hand 2 hand combat and secondary was regeneration, if that makes sense :D"
Cityofheroes,308jjf,speed_boost_this,5,Wed Mar 25 11:11:49 2015 UTC,"Stalker archetype presumably, ""hand 2 hand combat"" I'm guessing was Dark Melee but might have been Energy Melee, Martial Arts, or Street Justice.    Stalkers became so much better near the end of CoH's lifespan.  The assassin's strike attacks could be used outside of being hidden dropping to ""only"" Superior-level damage, regular attacks stacked up assassin's focus tokens (which ramped up crit chances for long fights), and they got a HP buff.  The class went from a hit-and-run AT to a ""hit really, really hard while hidden... then keep hitting hard until they ded"" class.  I want to play this game so bad I can taste it!"
Cityofheroes,308jjf,Vienna_The_Aeronaut,2,Wed Mar 25 15:05:43 2015 UTC,"I never got to play the buffed up stalkers, but I really loved the original concept of an assassin based gameplay. The biggest problem though was there were always just massive mobs of enemies and the game mechanics never allowed you to isolate and eliminate them. They just stood around, 10 guys cuddling together for bodywarmth or something talking about their day.   I feel like stalkers would have actually been a lot more fun/useful if the game had better AI, patrol paths and single minion guys roaming around without a platoon of backup holding hands together. People find bodies and a panic starts, a stalker could have easily taken them out one at a time while thugs scrambled around and the more organized groups the stalker would have a real challenge not just in dealing more damage but having to figure out how to get by the watches and how to eliminate the key targets/all of them without coming into a straight up fight. But that is all just imagining CoH with today's technology I suppose."

In the meantime, I'm going to try to be around to answer questions (in many ways my job description is 'general question answerer'). And, while we've been silent on reddit, on Facebook twitter and our homepage we've been posting regular updates (or at least tidbits - assurances we're still alive and there is game stuff being done.

There are other examples in both screen and in gaming that this has happened to, so why not CoH as well?    As far as your commentary goes... You aren't being entirely truthful, because if you 'loved it as much as the next player', then that comment doesn't happen.   Clearly, you don't.  For others love it more.  It's not a second coming.  It is THE coming.  No other game, before or since, has held my attention, and my desire to play it, as CoH did.  Not. One.  It's not just about the game, either, it's about the people I played with in the game too.  And I've been around the place.  CoH was special, I think.  Some don't think so. That's ok.  It's not for y'all then.  It'll be special again, hopefully, for those who do."
Cityofheroes,2yraau,Narissis,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:13:57 2015 UTC,"I don't have to like the game less to have realistic expectations of its prospects for return.  Star Trek, Family Guy, Futurama, and Firefly were mainstream media endeavours with an audience of millions and genuine industry interest.  CoH is an MMO that was played by at best 200,000 players and in which other potential publishers have shown no particular interest. All of the interest comes from the community, which is not a bad thing, but it's a different ball game.  I'm not saying that CoH won't come back; I'm just saying that there's no guarantee. I've said the same thing in the Bleach subreddit to people distraught that the anime ended, and received the same kinds of delusional responses from people convinced that it will return despite a complete dearth of evidence.  In CoH's case, there is actually a stronger likelihood of return than the Bleach anime since we know that talks have occurred, but that doesn't mean I'm going to obsess over it. Not until there is an official announcement that the reboot is greenlit.  The game was definitely special, and the surviving community is definitely special, and unique among MMOs for sure.  It's insulting that you would claim I have less appreciation for the game simply because I don't cling to the slim hope of its relaunch. I invested thousands of hours in the game and I still remember it fondly. Many of my characters have lived on through remakes in Champions.  But CoH closed in 2012. It's 2015 now. At some point you have to move on. That doesn't mean forgetting--obviously, my participation in this subreddit shows that I maintain an interest in the game and the events surrounding it--but I also have the good sense not to pine for it. I will wait and see what happens, but I'm not losing sleep in the meantime."

I loved CoH as much as the next player, but this chronic inability of the community to accept that it's gone is starting to border on mental illness.   This wasn't in any way insulting, nosir...   While I am not pining for it, I'm not clinging upon it's return... I do hold out hope that it will come to be.  I have other things to do, surely.  And I do them.  I just don't play much in the way of any computer games anymore, because CoH was the best, and nothing has been able to replace it.  Champions, Star Trek Online, (The game what's name shall not be mentioned), The Secret World, they all suck for me.  Which is a shame in the case of STO, I really wanted to like it, as a Trekkie, but damn that game is irritating to play.    Instead, I can go ride a motorcycle instead, or watch a movie, or go make something... so that's cool, don't need or want those others.  I'm good.  If it is to be that the cards will never be in the favor of CoH's return, that will be what it will be.  Until then... without hope and belief... there wouldn't be any reason to even have someone try.  Which is why there's yet another attempt, and farther than others have been... hope and belief.  That it can be done.  All I have left to say is this:  Go team!  C'mon NCSoft, sell the thing!"

Once they went into syndication, they gained popularity which merited a return. But the same does not apply to MMOs, no one can play a syndicated version of CoH (excluding Icon).   I would say that CoH's cancellation caused a huge portion of the player base who previously had forgotten about the game to rally behind it. Additionally, the disappearance of CoH made many realize the inferior quality of the of superhero MMOs. The power of the community not only gained mainstream media coverage (there was an article on CNN about the Altas park rally), but was able to convince NcSoft to go into talks.   I'm not expecting CoH's return anytime soon. But with a community this dedicated, and some fairly promising spin-offs (Valiance is looking pretty good from pre-alpha), I know one day we can all join together in something that at least resembles home."

Cityofheroes,2ygqrg,AntiVibe,3,Tue Mar 10 01:54:28 2015 UTC,"When the Respect Trial first launched it was surprisingly difficult, made all the more frustrating by the fact that most of the characters running the trial were doing so because they needed a respec to correct some build error.  The devs appropriately eased it up eventually.  Later on, with some power creep from new powersets and IO builds, the trial became so easy you spent most of your time waiting for the next spawn from the previous one that you vaporized in a split second."
Cityofheroes,2ygqrg,speed_boost_this,3,Tue Mar 10 02:12:33 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, besides for some changes to the trial itself, there are a few reasons the trial became much easier by the end of CoH:   Everyone was sidekicked to one below team leader Everyone above leader had access to +5 levels worth of powers Strategies became very streamlined/people new what kind of teammates were needed.   Also remember that IOs were fairly useless at the lower levels since you had less slots and most builds used IO sets that were lvl 50 which would have no bonuses during the trial since max lvl was 33 (max effective 38). Unless you're referring to the second and third trials which from my experience were rarely run in comparison."
Cityofheroes,2ygqrg,Mgas95,2,Tue Mar 10 05:49:34 2015 UTC,"Initially I was the same way, largely just used regular SOs until L50 then switched to an IO build.  In the last year or so I started planning out frankenslotted IO builds just to see and was pleasantly surprised how big of a help frankenslotting actually was.  I'd only add that IMO pre-50 IO slotting was better than you might think.  Obviously anecdotal, my experience was more folks running the second trial over the first presumably to fight the more entertaining Freakshow over the dull Sky Raiders.  That might have been true only of my server (Triumph), my circle of friends or even the time of day I happened to play, folks on an hour later might have had a completely different experience."
Cityofheroes,2ygqrg,speed_boost_this,2,Thu Mar 12 14:51:31 2015 UTC,"IMO, with regard to powersets, the new powersets never really experienced power-creep. In fact I think some of the newer sets were worse then the original powersets.  Some examples: Dual pistols, Dual Blades, and Kinetic Melee were all good sets but their Damage/activation time were originally fairly low compared to other sets until they were buffed. Energy Aura was very bad before it got reworked. And personally I found Traps and Trick Arrow very niche powersets that were never very good compared to other support powersets."
Cityofheroes,2ygqrg,Mgas95,2,Tue Mar 10 05:36:21 2015 UTC,"Titan Weapons was on my mind when I typed that, and even that set strongly depended on the skillset of the player.  An experienced CoHer could do silly things with TW, on the flipside I saw new players getting less out of TW than some of the launch powersets.  I'd probably check off the late-arrival Time Manipulation and Nature Affinity sets as stronger-than-average.  Shield Defense was IO-abusable and had an AoE attack.  Depending on how far one wants to go back, Willpower was a non-launch set that was IMO underrated.    But you're right, overall I'd say the CoH devs did a pretty good job of new powersets being pretty darn close to middle-of-the-road, if not erring on the side of being slightly underpowered.  Kinetic Melee, Staff Fighting, Street Justice come to mind as likely needed a second balancing pass.  Beam Rifle... not sure if that set was underpowered or if I kept self-handicapping by pairing it up with thematically-appropriate but mechanically-mixmatched secondary sets."

I stopped counting how much inf was going into his build once it entered the 11-digits range.  Softcapped DEF, impressive RES, decent regen, monstrous recharge and endrec.    It was the first axe build I truly enjoyed.  Without all the recharge bonuses I found axe to be a bit slow for my playstyle.  With tons of recharge, and with Shield's AoE attack thrown into the attack chain, it was such yummy goodness.  I had Tankers who weren't as durable as this guy and with nowhere near the offensive capability.  Superstrength/Shield, with both Foot Stomp and Shield Charge, must have been a monster AoEer!  That would be a nice Tanker build too, all that AoE knockdown while the team lights into the spawns."

I was pretty new and had my doubts but went along with it; felt I had no choice. (I took Flurry because 'shadow punches looks neat!' hence the Superspeed.)

This is mostly achieved by a process called ""packet sniffing"", where a third program logs all the interactions in a raw format which then later has to be interpreted and reverse engineered into something you can run that a client can interface with.  Two things inhibit this for Coh, firstly there was never any extensive sniffing done because it was against the eula and they were rather good at detecting it/shutting it down.

Cityofheroes,2wz63b,IdleRhymer,3,Wed Feb 25 13:39:04 2015 UTC,"It's not that NC aren't interested in making money on CoH. If they just give out the code for free they're giving up on using the IP in the future and tossing out their investment in it. I'd like them to release it but from a business perspective it wouldn't make much sense, unless they suddenly start valuing the goodwill of the CoH community."
Cityofheroes,2wz63b,Narissis,5,Tue Feb 24 16:51:05 2015 UTC,"their investment in creating it   Purchasing it*  Unless I'm mistaken, CoH was independent of NCSoft at release and for a while after."
Cityofheroes,2wz63b,IdleRhymer,2,Tue Feb 24 21:47:20 2015 UTC,"You're correct, although NC certainly funded a good percentage of the creation. I'll edit it to ""in it"" for accuracy."
Cityofheroes,2wz63b,BoldArch,2,Tue Feb 24 22:09:21 2015 UTC,"There are a few issues why there isn't a private server client...yet.  1-It takes a lot of resources to reverse engineer a game.  CoH has a relatively small community compared to other games.  The more popular a game is/was means a higher chance that there are people dedicated, able, an willing to illegally bring a game back.  2- The community on the whole still hopes that the game will be brought back officially and knows that a private server client may hurt that chance.  3- The people smart enough to reverse engineer something are probably more inclined to make money building or contributing to a successor."
Cityofheroes,2wz63b,ZeroXephon,2,Tue Feb 24 19:19:01 2015 UTC,I take it that the company that was in talks with NCsoft failed.
Cityofheroes,2wz63b,speed_boost_this,12,Tue Feb 24 13:19:30 2015 UTC,"Nobody is officially saying anything.  Which, unofficially, strongly suggests the negotiations are still underway, that folks are still under NDAs to not say anything about the negotiations has the obvious implication the negotiations are still afoot.  We probably won't hear any news until the deal is 100% secured and well underway.  I'm cautiously optimistic that the deal will indeed come to fruition and we're not too far removed from CoH reopening its doors."
Cityofheroes,2wz63b,Vienna_The_Aeronaut,6,Tue Feb 24 15:11:58 2015 UTC,"Indeed an announcement will happen either way, but the fact that negotiations have lasted this long is oddly comforting. Knowing the company that currently holds onto CoH and their cultural influence this means something, if you look into the journey people had to take just to open up those negotiations you can sort of see what I mean."
Cityofheroes,2wz63b,Oknight,4,Tue Feb 24 19:59:16 2015 UTC,"The folks involved are reportedly cheerful and totally silent.  Nate recently joked about being cruel on the subject on one of the Facebook forums.  I SUSPECT the deal is signed (in some form or other) and they are not announcing until they have the server images running (the multiple servers are a bitch to get to communicate correctly) and the replacement pieces (account manager, store, etc) development is done.  Nate has mentioned that he has had to sign many NDA's (not that he's saying he is currently under an NDA for CoH, since if one existed, his saying so would probably violate it)"
Cityofheroes,2wz63b,speed_boost_this,3,Wed Feb 25 00:17:37 2015 UTC,"Whoah. I had no idea about this. Exciting! I wouldn't care if they developed it any further, I'd just like to jump inworld now and then and finish building some of my favorite characters."
Cityofheroes,2wz63b,blowuptheking,1 point,Wed Feb 25 06:44:24 2015 UTC,"That's exciting. I really would just like to pal around the city.. not looking for a full on MMO experience again though, but I suppose I'd take it if I had to. I saved all my characters with that titan network tool way back. Hopefully that will help?"
Cityofheroes,2wz63b,speed_boost_this,3,Wed Feb 25 06:43:30 2015 UTC,"Personally I find it highly doubtful than a relaunched CoH would allow for our old characters to return.  It sounds like we definitely wouldn't get them back from NCSoft themselves because they didn't save character data.  As for that export tool, I don't think the team relaunching CoH would be able to trust that data.  Hang on to those exports, at the least you'd have the info on how to properly rebuild the costume.  But I fully expect I'll be running my previous L50s back through the game for a second go-around.  And perfectly fine with that!  Everyone starting out on the ground floor is the fair way to go!"
Cityofheroes,2wz63b,blowuptheking,2,Wed Feb 25 13:09:52 2015 UTC,"The Sentinel tool (the one that saved the character's data) was made by the same group that's doing the negotiations, so I'm sure they trust it. They also said they built a checksum into the file so they can tell if it's been tampered with."
Cityofheroes,2wz63b,speed_boost_this,2,Wed Feb 25 13:41:06 2015 UTC,"That's fair enough.  Lets assume the tool could be trusted, now the question is should it be?    CoH relaunches and for the folks who ran Sentinel they get their stable of characters back.  How many former CoHers will pop up complaining that they left upon the closing's announcement and never got the opportunity to run the tool?  Or that they didn't follow forums and had no idea it existed?  Will some people running around on Day One with dozens of L50s run off the people who are forced to start completely over?  In other words, from a business standpoint does allowing the import of these Sentinel exports for the people lucky enough to make them outweigh any associated costs from the people who didn't?    I don't know the answer to that question but I do believe the latter is a non-trivial enough concern that the revival team will at least consider the option of not allowing Sentinel imports.  These combined issues are why I personally have my doubts the imports will be allowed.  They might be but I wouldn't consider their mere existence as evidence that they'll surely be supported.  I've 49 L50s that were exported that I'd love to get back but if they decide to have everyone start at the ground floor I wouldn't grumble (too much).  I love the game, just want to play it again, and in some ways being forced to start over would be free-ing.  Some of those old characters I'd re-roll to be a better powerset combination, some would even change ATs, my former badger would likely switch, etc."
Cityofheroes,2wz63b,blowuptheking,2,Thu Feb 26 12:22:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they would allow Sentinel imports, but since the same team that made the tool is the one that's rebooting it (assuming the talks pan out), it's an option. Sentinel imports wouldn't even be a consideration if it were being rebooted by NCSoft or some other third party."

Then CoV dropped and the group died because as the group leader i spent all my time in CoV while everyone else continued to enjoy CoH and the group never recovered... but that's fine we had an absolute blast in the game.

Cityofheroes,2wuv8y,speed_boost_this,3,Mon Feb 23 09:41:59 2015 UTC,"Loved the CoV content and I understood the desire to keep a separation between heroic and villainous missions, but the practical result was to split an already-small gaming community in half.    Over time the separation was increasingly weakened, ATs could be rolled for either side, side-switching was possible afterwards, and it was looking like most new zones going forward were going to be side-neutral so everyone could get in to them.  But the damage was already done, I suspect CoX would have had twice the population it did at closing if it didn't run off a non-trivial number of players in the year or so after CoV launched when the available players to team with in any given hero/villain zone was essentially cut in half."
Cityofheroes,2wuv8y,speed_boost_this,4,Mon Feb 23 14:10:31 2015 UTC,"(My second post for a different topic)  Outright copying comic characters into CoH was always a sore spot for me especially after Marvel sued CoH trying to close the doors over intellectual property theft.  Really what Marvel wanted was a judge to simply hand over the game to them at which point they would have slapped a ""City of Marvel"" label over the game's title but the judge would have none of it, basically smacking them down over two topics:  1) All of the character ""dupes"" they presented in court were dupes the claimant created themselves.  You don't sue someone for breaking into your house by breaking into your own house to demonstrate how easy it is.  2) Cryptic couldn't be held responsible for individual players making dupes any more than Crayola over kids drawing pics of Spidey.  Still, Cryptic had to show they performed Due Diligence when it came to handling dupes and they (Cryptic) asked the player base to refrain from dupes and to report any dupes spotted.  As we came somewhat close to losing CoH over these dupes I wasn't too fond of them so yeah they got reported by me aggressively.  Used to keep pics of my unconfirmed kills before that well largely dried up.  I'll say this, some of the dupes made surprisingly ingenious usage of the CoH character creator."

This is why most Underground Trials limited participation to Lv 53 or 54 Incarnate Heroes. You also should stay close to Desdemona during the final battle for her buffs (which wasn't always easy), and the tanks had to keep a small separate team elsewhere. Like the normal-Hamidon raid really.  The whole encouter was just very different from what most of the game offered elsewhere, so players weren't used to this kind of challenge."

My proudest moment in all the game I ever did.  For those that don't know...  It's a bit of a tale, so siddown, shuddup, and hang on...  I read upon the old CoH forums of something called a 'Man build'.  Aka, build a character with only regular human powers, like a solider and a gun, or arrow, or such like that.  Or just fisticuffs, I suppose.  I sort of glossed over it, to be honest, but the light went on, and... well, that was that.   It did not, as it happened, help that I'd seen that (The game what's name shall not be mentioned) episode of South Park.  You know the one.   So, armed with determination and demented thoughts, I was destined then and there to build THE Man Build.  There would be no Manlier build than mine.  Built to stand up to damn near anything, and also to humiliate anyone who came upon him.  He was built as a brute.  This was when you could do it as a hero.  A hero brute, and he had Willpower secondary.  He had War Mace as the primary, but never used it.  I would have forgone the primary if I could have, because the only power he would ever use in terms of offense would be...  Brawl.  That's all.  He was a Brawl/WP brute.  And I called him The Brawling Humiliator.  An homage to Quake III's Humiliated call when one used the Gauntlet upon their PvP foe.  I got into AP, and the journey began.  He was a real Zen character.  I set Brawl for Auto, so all I had to do is to run up to a targeted character, and he would start to bap bap bap them into submission.  At first, +0 bosses were just near to impossible.  +0 LTs took forever.  Minions were ok to deal with.  So I played the slow game.  Graduated to the Hollows.  Kings row.  Skyway or Steel, depending on my mood.  IP turned out to be the way to go.  And so on.  Those who saw me by the time I got somewhere to Steel/Skyway and on would notice I would somehow have anywhere from 10-20 minions surrounding me as I was going after +2 LTs and +1 Bosses.  I called it the Heal Posse.  Rise to the Challenge is a fantastic power. :)  bap  bap  bap  I'd use Build Up and BH would raise his Mace... and just use his other hand to pummel, never once did he swing that Mace.  It took about 5-6 months of playing as I could, but eventually, I wound up in Dark Astoria, for to get the 48-50 levels.  And he got there.  He was by then standing in a crowd of +5 and even +6 bosses, LTs, and Minions, taking them ALL out eventually.  bap bap bap  DING Level up!    Awright!  50!  I was ecstatic!  I'd done what I don't think anyone else had in the game!  I was the proud, demented owner of the game's only Brawling 50.  Oh, did I mention I did this solo, street sweeping, no teams, no missions, no contacts?  No?  Oh, well, yeah, that's how I did it.  I could have done missions.  I could have done teams.  Naw.  This was an ex boxer.  Sweepin' was the thing, to me.  I went on his Alpha mission, got that done.  All my 50s did that when it came out.  I then turned him Villain (which was explainable by a thought process of he had to double cross people to get that evil scientist!... also that was SO fun, doing those tips... :p)  for one specific badge... Army of Me.  He wore it forever after acquiring that.  And then I finished his round trip back (the explanation was he had to get people to trust him again, to earn his place back in the ranks of Hero)  And he never left that Hero status again.  I played him a lot even after he got to 50.  I used him as a stress reliever tool.  His 'no teams' thing was lifted, for I was going to get whatever defensive Incarnate stuff I could for him...  I beat Hero One +1 EB.  All those Rikti was a heck of heal posse.    I even beat Praetor Sinclair/Chimera +3 EB... it took me an honest 40 minutes of juking to beat him, that was a tough one.  He had HIGH DPS to me... and I had no heal posse... no inspirations... Just  BH... but I did it.  I couldn't believe it.  And did NOT die... came close... but nope. I dare say that was the absolute biggest proudest moment right there... I beat that dude down with just BRAWL.  Who the HELL does that?   I do. :D  And then 6 months later, the game stopped. :(  I only played him that last day.  I had a Plantm to go around all the borders of all the zones and clear them out.  But my work screwed that all to hell that day, but I still made it in, and did what I could towards that Plantm .  For the last 10 minutes, I logged in as my recently created houtex character (sorta looks like me IRL) and at the very stroke of the very last second of the game's existence... I had timed the Self Destruct to blow.  Timed perfectly.  Except the unknown exact moment of the actual kick, so I stayed blowed up for about 2 minutes, then... kicked.    Anyway, BH was the one that taught me more about the game, how it worked, what to do, all kinds of things that I hadn't considered... the Market, the IOs, the Set bonuses, even the Accolades... all that because of my lunacy of actually making this, on the face of it, really dumb character... One that wound up being able to go toe to toe with a Rikti Pylon.  To drag a Siege or a Nightstar in the BAF.  Sure, he was useless if it had to be done quickly.. but if he had time (and enough DPS)... you would not touch him easily, and you WOULD go down.    I loved that character.  So fun.  So silly.  So. Freakin'. Awesome.  I will make him again if CoH ever runs again.  Mark my words."

How do you know you're the only one to do that?  Every now and then back on the official forums I'd see people state they were the only or the first to do something and I never could figure out how the claim was established.  Because nobody else had spoke of it on the forums?  A very, very small minority of CoHers ever participated on the boards.    Really not trying to downplay your achievement, the point is it'd be just as awesome if you were, say, the third person to have done it in CoH."
Cityofheroes,2vu7n0,speed_boost_this,1 point,Tue Feb 24 02:49:25 2015 UTC,"No worries!  But I'll just counter with this:  The forums were used for years.  People would have bragged about that particular achievement.  I would have suspected then that someone would have remembered.  For it's just weird and memorable as Strong and Pretty, Gone to the Americans, and /jranger, among others that were forum famous, I'd suspect.  Maybe... don't wanna be all high and mighty, those were some pretty strongly remembered items, I'd say, and I dunno if BH would be in that class or not, but the achievement itself probably might.  Further, just about everyone on Pinnacle at the time knew of the silliness of BH and that crazy idiot houtex who was making him happen.  And many of them didn't stay on just Pinnacle.  Word did get around.  And since I was talking and talking about it for 6 months, off and on, in game and on the forums (and there were witnesses to boot, I might add), there was plenty of opportunity for someone to have said 'Simpsons did it!' and steal mah thunders.  Nobody did.  Now much like so many things in life, absence of proof does not constitute proof itself, and I grant that there's just as much possibility that there were dozens of brawl/? scrappers, tanks and/or brutes, and they all went 50 at least, and they all did it solo, and they all did it with no missions, no contacts, and never once used anything offensive whatsoever but Brawl (say, Brawl/Fire Brute, maybe, would be cheating, IMO.  So would a nuke or a shivan or whatever) and I was only the second, third, or 20th.  All I can say is unless someone here or elsewhere states differently... and so far, nobody has...   I am the only one.    Evar.  :D"

We were doing the Eden Trial, and he would go and grab the entire bloody map. Scared the bejeezus out of me, as there was no way I could possibly lock down that many giant crystals. That tank actually made me, as a controller, feel quite useless.  On the other hand, in the CHimera mission where you have to deal with him and ALL of his ninjas, I managed to lock down all of his minions with my flash/EMP combo. (Again, before the cap on how many targets AoEs could affect) That was pretty satisfying.  Until they woke up, and were mad."

Cityofheroes,2vu7n0,Thundercleese5,3,Thu Feb 19 22:01:28 2015 UTC,"We shut down a server.  This was on the Infinity server. Remember the portals in the Circle of Thorns underground layers? If you stood next to a portal, demons would start spitting out.   I was second in command of the super group ""The Conglomerate"" under the name ""Black Caduceus"" while my wife (Red Hecate) co-ran the SG ""Paragon Heroes Incorporated"" (or something like that) with ""Mr. Fury. Red Tomax was a member in either my or my wife's super group at the time.   My wife was a Kinetics defender back when Empaths (which I ran) were the only defenders people asked for. My wife had just gotten to level 32. This is very important.  We were in the Circle of Thorns underground lair by a portal when we discovered something: there was no limit on how many demons would spawn. My wife had just gotten ""Fulcrum Shift"" and was still feeling her way around it. We eventually wiped, but it gave us an idea. What if we collected select members of our super groups, filled out a full group, and tried to pull as many demons as possible.   We were prepared specifically for this encountered. We were all SO'd up and easily blew our way to the portal. Then the fun began. The demons kept doubling and doubling and we were unstoppable. It got to the point where the little room was like a Hamidon raid - heavily stuttering graphics. It was impossible to tell where anyone was... it was all a pool of glowing.   Fulcrum Shift, you see, had NO LIMITS at the time. The more demons that popped out, the more FS would stack, and the more invincible we became. It got to the point where the little FS buff symbols stretched across my screen over five lines.   Then, everything froze. We were on Teamspeak at the time. Everyone confirmed that everything froze. Then we all were kicked out to the login screen. When we signed in, the Infinity server had grey indicators next to it. We verbally high fived and started the process all over again. The server didn't shut down but the animation did slow down to the point of unplayability. I think I gained 7 levels on that run.  VERY shortly afterwards, they placed limits on how many times FS could stack and how many demons would pop out of the portal. Our little adventure could have happened at a time when the server was popping out for a second anyway, but I like to think we crashed it."

I spelled chicken wrong cause I thought it was cool that the last parts looked together; dissapointed that I couldn't name him Finger Lickin Chickin, but I digress.  I could never get far with him just because of the pure difficulty factor of the two powers I used together I ended up with a mountain of debt and stopped playing.  But I always came back every now and then to whittle it down.  Mostly just stared at the costume creator making new costumes for him.  A tech chicken, a mythological chicken I had it all.

I made stupid builds that people doubted turn out to be amazing (Like Stompy McStomperson, my super strength/shield brute who would shield bash into groups, then do NOTHING but foot stomp because the recharge time matched the animation time). I solo'd stuff, I made really cool stuff after many frustrating days in the base builder, ect.  The memorable moments will always be with my friends though. Our 16 minute ITF comes to mind, or toons that we managed to level up 1-50 JUST by trick or treating. We learned many of the big Incarnate trials when no one really understood them (I made a guide and maps that spread throughout the forums and various websites for the LAMBDA so we could help PUGs figure out what to do), but of all of those things the one that sticks out was the first time my group did the Lord Recluse Strike Force.  Now, our group was primarily hero side. I loved the villain side, but others in our group didnt like it as much, so we rarely played there. After Going Rogue some of our group wanted to go over and get villain badges, and we ran various trials and strike forces, all that I had done before, no big deal. Then we got to the LRSF, which none of us had done. For those of you that do not know this ends on a map of Atlas Park, where under the statue of Atlas you fight SEVEN Heroes (the villain side equivalent of AVs) at the same time, each of them a high level, and using a wide variety of powers to hold, taunt, and otherwise destroy you (and heal and I think even rez each other). We found a guide with multiple strategies of sniping and pulling, who to get, who would follow, ect. None of it was working for us. While our group could blow through most any challenge we just could not separate these guys and we had over an hour of solid team wipes. We ditched the guide and came up with our own strategies, pulled out random temp powers we had been saving, another hour of team wipes. Frustration and despair have now set in, and we decide to try one last thing. Purple up (as many defense inspirations as we need to hit defense caps) and charge in guns blazing.  And it freaking worked. I doubt I will ever forget the cheers we let out, or the frustration I felt that of all our brilliant plans, purple up and charge was what worked."

We would do duels and what not.   There was a group of three stalkers fanning people that was standing around watching the duels and chatting with friends.   I always made sure no matter what my dull pain was on whenever it was up. Well those stalkers picked me as their next victim.   They surrounded me. They all tried to hit me with AS at the same time but they didn't. When the first one hit I went and hit reconstruction. Then the second AS hit luckily the third AS missed (phew!). I run after one and fear him and start to pound him. At this time everyone goes after the other 2. Needless to say. We ran them out of BB the rest of the day.

I had a dial-up connection, though, and I was in the Rikti War Zone during some sort of super busy time of the day.  I took the mission, and it took forever to load.  I was convinced it would make me disconnect.  Then, my Scrapper stepped into a snake cave in the Villain side of the game, with someone else's mission description in my active mission thing.  That person wasn't around, though.  I ran about, and discovered Snakes, that I beat, clearing the cave of all the serpents.  There were not, alas, enough for the Mongoose badge.  From that time on, my hero (Cyber Sunset) had an unusual progress bar in his list of badges.  Its description was just a bunch of question marks, and I wanna say that the bar was somewhere between a fourth and halfway filled.  I tried reproducing the glitch that sent me Redside once or twice, but never did.  Later, when Going Rogue came out, that mystery bar turned into the progress bar that marked Snakes beaten, confirming my suspicions.  Nothing came of it, of course, but it was something I was always a little proud of.  ...even if it was all the result of dumb luck."

I was a serious alt-aholic so I never really focused on getting all those purple IO sets, the PVP ones, and all the rest. But after a little under five years, I managed to complete every single slot. Was so happy. The first I did was go to AE and see if I could take on a Archvillain solo. I think it was Barracuda- I'm not sure, but I was super happy when I took her down ten minutes after. I the proceeded to test myself against Babbage (I can't remember but I think it was him). Unfortunately, my dps wasn't good enough, but my health never went below 90%. This was before incarnates came out, and I never tested myself after that but I know I could have been able to nudge the GM's health a little bit lower if I had my Reactive and Hybrid powers (both were the damage buff ones). A close second however is when I decided to try out badge hunting. This was about half a year before the shutdown, and I managed top just over 1000 badges. The ability to change alignments was a godsend when it came to getting a high number of badges. If the game were ever to come back, I think badge-hunting would be one of the first things I would start doing, after remaking all my characters of course (which is A LOT :P). Come to think of it, anyone interested in doing just that if the game comes back?"

Cityofheroes,2vpeb5,BrownEye_o,2,Fri Feb 13 06:28:54 2015 UTC,"To be honest I am really disappointed in City of Titans and Heroes/Villians.  Neither has shown any efforts worthwhile that prove there is actually a legitimate effort behind it, while I still believe Heroes/Villians is a 1 girl project with no actual updates whatsoever.  The only project that seems to be making healthy progress is Valliance online and I actually tried to support the project but amazon payments were preventing me from contributing during their kickstarter.  My biggest issue with VO is that the animations look.....stiff but I hope that having an ex-coh dev on the project will help that.  VO deserves way more support and visibility from the ex-coh community than they are currently getting."
Cityofheroes,2vpeb5,BoldArch,1 point,Tue Feb 24 19:10:11 2015 UTC,I appreciate the honesty. VO does look promising but I am keeping in mind that everything they have shown is pre-alpha. Some big changes could come out in a heart beat for both VO and CoT. Thanks for sharing :)

Hope you didn't plan on going anywhere for a while, and that DoT will kill you in four seconds.  And I really with the Rularuu were expanded upon further. Lots of potential there.

Cityofheroes,2tpb9i,tenkadaiichi,7,Mon Jan 26 14:26:22 2015 UTC,"Malta were always one of the more interesting groups to fight. They had so many tricks up their sleeves that always made fighting the usual rabble a bit more interesting. You had the sappers which if you missed one in a group or they ambushed you midway through a fight could very dramatically change the flow of combat, the rather fun mechs roaming around and potential to fuse into a bigger baddie, and their gunslingers were always tougher than they appeared.   My honourable mention would be Rikti because they were just interesting as a group. Alien invaders turned stranded and lost cut off from their own home. Especially after we started to receive more lore about the Rikti themselves and what they actually were with the Vanguard and revamped Crash Site."
Cityofheroes,2tpb9i,Vienna_The_Aeronaut,3,Mon Jan 26 08:45:39 2015 UTC,"I loved almost all the villain groups in CoH (some were kind of ""boring"", though, like the Family), but I really miss running into evil doppelgangers of your character in certain arcs/missions. That was such a cool feature that I can't think of being done in any other MMO.  As for actual established groups, I have a lot of nostalgia for the Clockwork and the Carnival of Shadows,"
Cityofheroes,2tpb9i,themosquito,3,Mon Jan 26 21:26:13 2015 UTC,"I liked the Family as almost a back drop. I mean old school mobsters to beat up? That's friggen' awesome! I totally wanna bust into their operations like its the 1920's! But then these random mooks and thugs were able to hold their own against superheroes flinging around fire and pure energy like everyone was fighting with plastic bats. That was kind of offputting since you found them at mid-higher levels. At least with the Tsoo or Warriors or even Council/5th you could say ""Oh they have magic/artefacts/technology that helps them compare"" hell even the Trolls had a reason for being a threat but the Family was just...guys with tommy guns, fedoras, and suits."
Cityofheroes,2tpb9i,Vienna_The_Aeronaut,3,Wed Jan 28 01:37:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, the Family had a pretty good way of explaining how they could go toe-to-toe with superheroes. During the height of their criminal empire, they actually were able to create a pure strain of Supadrine that had zero of the negative effects. So, they have a decent collection of this 'wonder drug' that they give to their 'top men' in order to make it so they were able to fight supers.   They didn't go to far into this backstory in the game but some of the lore around the game talks about it. The game actually did a fairly good job at explaining how people could hold their own, as you pointed out with the other villain groups. So, yup, Mooks used their drug empire to make pure strands of supadrine to inject their boys. Cool, huh?"

Cityofheroes,2tc0u1,Colliholic,25,Thu Jan 22 21:53:11 2015 UTC,"So here's the deal. Plan Z was the codename for an idea that was to be the spiritual successor (made by the community) for City of Heroes. Essentially the same game, rebuilt with new characters. That plan split in two, creating what are now known as City of Titans and Heroes and Villains. Then, out of nowhere, Valiance Online entered open Alpha and announced that Synapse from Paragon had joined their team. So, needless to say, they're winning the race as of now, with CoT in second.   BUT.  There is also a ""Rescue Operation"", with ongoing talks to convince NCSoft to sell the IP, which would allow a small studio to relaunch the game, though the servers would not be included in the deal and people would have to remake their characters. This deal, if completed, would also then allow the three ""spritual successor"" games to reference City of Heroes characters, and maybe even be referenced in future City of Heroes patches, which would be totally awesome."

I do know, if I ever win the MegaMillion, I'll be buying the game (if that's possible) and relaunching it.  In this age, there is no reason for an MMO to ever go offline.  As long as there are enough users to support some level of development and customer/product support then you can make it happen.

Though, to be honest, if I were trying to finance a CoH reboot with MaxMillions winnings, I probably wouldn't revive the old game. As great as it was, it was already starting to age severely.  Instead, I'd probably seek to revive Paragon Studios, bring back as many of the original devs as possible, and start a project to create a CoH2 with the same setting, lore, characters and powersets using a more modern game engine and probably with action-RPG style combat like TERA or Neverwinter."

The team has expanded and multiple zones are being worked upon.  Also, there was at least 2 teams working on making a new server. One was referred to as SCORE (secret cabal of reverse engineers). The other was an offshoot by one of the SCORE team.  He actually advertised on this subreddit for people to help and got as far as creating an interface between the game and a future client and had an authentication server built in.  It had its own subreddit (/r/Woofers), with a link to the source of his project.    However, he suddenly went quiet about a month or so after starting it up.  I'm guessing the xxBudweiserxx from the old Champion server blabbed about it in the CoH Survivors facebook page and someone asked him to stop in order to not intefere with the negotiations with NCSoft.  All that is conjecture, but if the real deal is coming someday this would have jeopardized it.  The pace of the negotiations with NCSoft are moving at a glacial pace."

Some of my favorites;  Talsor Tech - My Claws/Electric Brute, founding member of Talsorian Guard and my only Incarnate.  IllusionForce - Illusion/ Force Field Controller with teleport.

Cityofheroes,2sthby,Hirsty3359,6,Tue Mar 3 20:26:09 2015 UTC,My favorite character was a claws/regen scrapper named Celsion (actually CeIsion because Celsion was taken). He was by no means my most powerful character but he was always really fun to play. I went on to remake him in CO.
Cityofheroes,2sthby,Mgas95,4,Sun Jan 18 19:13:09 2015 UTC,"In the end, I counted and had 40 level 50 characters spread between Virtue, Freedom, Guardian and Protector.  A lot of them were probably a waste of time since I do not even remember their names, back story or how I played them.  14 I do remember were fully IO'd, at least one of every type of incarnate to level 4:  AR/NRG Blaster Fire/Fire Blaster Spines/Dark Scrapper DM/Regen Scrapper Elec/Shield Brute Mercs/Pain Mastermind Zombie/Dark Mastermind Ninjas/Thermal Mastermind Bots/Traps Mastermind Thugs/Time Mastermind DB/Nin Stalker Kin/NRG Stalker Staff/IA Stalker StJ/SR Stalker  Favorite, a 3-way tie!  Spines/Dark Scrapper, Zombie/Dark MM and StJ/SR Stalker.  Favorite backstory, Thugs/Time MM.  Jessica Woodman seeking justice for the death of her father, Michael Woodman (Murdered principal at a Brooklyn highschool).  Longbow were involved and a massive cover up.  The thugs were named after Kotter and the Sweathogs (Barbarino was the Bruiser; Horshack was the arsonist)."
Cityofheroes,2sthby,ricodah,3,Sun Jan 18 17:55:35 2015 UTC,"I had a spines/dark scrapper, that thing was Unstoppable! Even though I am partial to playing controllers, I loved every second of ripping bad guys heads off with her. that scrapper would just dominate anything that walked in front of it."
Cityofheroes,2sthby,Whitesnowbird1,2,Tue Jan 20 03:52:42 2015 UTC,"I wasn't that much into farming but my SG teammate needed some levels so we went into AE farm mish, +3x8, parked myself in the center and I just ran the auras (Quills/Death Shroud) with Dark Regeneration on auto.  Went afk for 20 minutes and came back with the farm mish done and me standing tall in the center."
Cityofheroes,2sthby,ricodah,4,Thu Jan 22 03:33:34 2015 UTC,"L T. He was a dual blades/will power Scrapper. He's one of the few characters I made that I actually got to level 50 xD. The dual blades combos were a lot of fun. Having those extra effects for different situations was cool, not to mention the animations were dope. Will Power was a match made in heaven for my terrible computer. No maintenance, just click my toggles on and I don't have to worry about them for the rest of the play session. The survivability was also pretty great for a Scrapper, I used to play the role of honorary Tanker when the team couldn't find one."
Cityofheroes,2sthby,speed_boost_this,2,Sun Jan 18 17:57:14 2015 UTC,"Willpower was an excellent match for Dual Blades in particular, a low-maintenance armor set so you could focus on setting up the DB combos.  Had a character named Phantomime that I dearly loved but her initial build was DB/Dark.  Got her to 50 but it was often frustrating, the needs of Dark Armor tripped over the needs of Dual Blades way too often.  Ended up re-rolling her as DB/Will and the entire trip back to 50 was a joy!  (Missed the thematic look of Dark Armor on her, though.  Was able to bring at least some of that back with the Ghosts aura)"
Cityofheroes,2sthby,webbed_feets,5,Tue Jan 20 15:34:53 2015 UTC,"I never made a strong backstory or theme so I can only comment on playstyle.   My dark/dark defender was my first level 50. He wasn't very offensive, but he could shut down mobs like nobody's business. They're was a lv32 debuff pet (Dark Servant, maybe?) that had a fast recharge so you could respond in the middle of new mobs. My illusion/radiation controller with perma-Phantom Army was an offensive powerhouse. I loved neutralizing the mobs and having my pets do the killing But my all time favorite was my Warshade. I've never found any character in an MMO that was as much fun to play. That archetype rewarded you for taking huge risks and fighting way too many mobs. I died all the time, but I gained XP so fast it didn't matter."
Cityofheroes,2sthby,Novalisk,4,Sun Jan 18 17:58:57 2015 UTC,"My favorite was Auroxis, an Empathy/Rad Defender on Freedom.  It was my first main and last main, as the rush of team support always made me log back in. Navigating through narrow hallways to save a scrapper that decided to go off on his own, using PBU+Vengeance+Rez to turn a losing fight into a winning one, and never forgetting to use Fortitude on the right teammate when it was up.   Was definitely my favorite character! Min-maxing the build with purple IO's, discussing Empathy on the Defender forums (was my forum name as well), and doing crazy shit with him when we got incarnate powers. Examples Here and Here."

But my favorite was Brawling Humiliator. Brawl/WP brute.  He had a six slotted brawl and as much recharge and damage and accuracy you could put into the character, as well as end and HP.  Basically, I only had Brawl and Build Up as the offense, and the entire character was otherwise defensively built to the hilt.  Wasn't much he couldn't stand around and take, unless it had serious -Def or -Eng.  He was a solo, no missions, street sweep only character.  I never used anything but Brawl.  I got him to 50+ Alpha Slot.  It was glorious.  I learned more about the game mechanics with that one than any other.  He could stand at a Rikti Pylon all day and it could shoot him and he'd beat upon it and nobody's winning. :)  EBs were nothing but time consuming.  AVs and GMs were about the only thing he couldn't defeat with his Mighty Brawl of Win... but typically, neither could they defeat him.  I miss him. :("

""My favorite character evar!""  I always seemed to gravitate back to my fire/fire brute Baal Hammon so I'll tentatively give him the nod.  Goofy-crazy fun to play, fire/fire simply belonged with the brute Fury mechanic, wasn't the most durable of my brutes but darn was he fun to play.  (49 L50s on closing day.

Probably my favorite, nothing feels better than being a classic super hero and smashing baddies with pure strength.  Mrs. Rocket was lvl 50 fire/martial arts tank, ultra rockets wife.  E. Flow was cool dude with sunglasses. Lvl 50 electric/shield scrapper. Crazy damage with lightning rod (I believe it was called) and shield bash. IO'd out he was running maxed difficulty farms by himself."

He was my main for years and was a Super Strength/Invuln. tanker and he had quite the many purple IO's. The only character that I ever played who could take on maximum difficulty and enemies alone. I loved the fact that his only weakness was psychic like Juggernaut.  Phuerton Skuerto my Energy/Energy blaster and my first character ever. I miss flying around with him and blowing the hell out of things.  Duneyr my Weather Control/Archery defender. He was such a fun character and could wreck so many enemies. I just loved his offensive nature for a defender. So fun.  Wish I could boot up the game and play these guys right now.

She could heal, tank, debuff, buff, rezz others, rezz herself, controll, dish out damage and teleport the fallen, or ferry the weak. Her claim to fame in my supergroup was soloing an Archvillain.

Total Dependent would be one, being as she had NO offense, whatsoever, really, and also not a whole lot of defense either.  She therefore required a team to get XP.  She was a rad / ICE Defender.  Somehow, I managed to get enough teams that didn't mind her to get her to 50.  Whee!  But my favorite unique thing/character was Brawling Humiliator.  He was a solo, street sweep, no missions, no teaming, BRAWL/WP Brute.  Well, ok, I picked Mace because it was funny to have him stand there and hold it, but never use it, as he would pummel the face of his enemies with his 6 slotted, boxing gloved brawling fists.  He got to 50+ Alpha Slot, and had standoffs with Rikti Pylons, Giant Monsters... Wouldn't defeat them, but would in fact just stand there all day. Mobs of 20+?  No problem.    He was so fun, and weird.  :)  It was fun to twist the game up like that as a character.  Make something challenging instead of uber.  Although BH was indeed uber in a way, I suppose. :)"

Those early levels were rough when you had to be careful not to aggro ANYTHING otherwise you'd be wiped.

When CoV came out I could create a plant character but the game would consider him a villain, not a hero. So I roleplayed Plantboy as herolike as possible within the game. I only attacked evil mobs & not the good, not even R.I.P. despite clearly being corrupt at times. & I abused the hell out of once-a-week mission bypass feature to skip anything that was unethical. Admittedly this made progression extremely slow for Plantboy, but I became hooked on my self-imposed challenge. That is until F2P made all powersets alignment neutral & I went ahead & gave him a fresh start.  Concept characters was something I revelled in COH. Probably about 2 dozen created characters, none of whom made it past lv16 because I kept making more & switching between them."
Cityofheroes,2s79ou,MAtgS,3,Tue Jan 13 06:49:52 2015 UTC,"There was something about the two-power system that really lent itself to creative concept characters.    Champions has too few restrictions; it's playing tennis without a net.  DCUO's weapon system simply subordinates one powerset over the other, leading to a one-dimensional character.    CoH had the right balance of structure and freedom."
Cityofheroes,2s79ou,Leviathan419,3,Tue Jan 13 15:05:04 2015 UTC,"My brother made hilariously annoying characters.  He rolled a Robotics MM and then leveled up enough so that he'd have a bunch of robots, and then he'd go next to PCs who were shopping or talking to contacts and have all his robots do jumping jacks so it would be really really noisy. Apparently people would pay him to stop."
Cityofheroes,2s79ou,Cassirer,3,Tue Jan 13 17:30:09 2015 UTC,"Trick or Treat in Warburg.  There was one little bunker area on the NW (?) coast of the island, a little bit away from the Missile launch area which was littered with doors mere feet away from each other, so you could chain-spawn the Halloween mobs with minimal effort.   What about the PvP you say? Well, this zone was mostly deserted 24/7 on my server, so I'd say finding a use for it was nice. Setting /hide never hurt though.  The next best places I can think of were the Warehouse district in SW Grandville, and similarly the Warehouse district in the far western area of the Talos Island across the bridge.  I believe some people found similarly effective areas in Striga Island around the docks, and in the more recent Rikti War Zone."

What were their lives like before the walls..? What would they have been doing when I wasn't playing them?   I remember just flying. The long lonely ride to Terra Volta while responding to a trial party. Patrolling The Hollows. Navigating Dark Astoria. Discovering the Shadow Shard. Bird's Eye View of The Hamidon. Learning how close was too close. Exploration badges. Oh so many of those..   I used to make new characters just to run the sewers and see if I could make it to ten before the group broke up. I used that a lot to tell me if this toon was a keeper.   I remember trying to guess whenever I started a Task Force which new face would be the first to bow out on the rest of us? I stopped doing that the first time it was me. I crashed and couldn't log back in. Wasn't my fault but.. that's when I got it.

One day I logged in, and this mission had changed. But the ""Create a mission"" feature was live, so with a little research I was able to pretty much re-create the map and mobs."

I don't remember when I took a break before the video recording (I, like many players, took more than one ""break"" from the game), but I did mention in the video that I had the Stamina power pool and needed to respec out because it had become inherent. But respeccing was always such a pain and I found myself not knowing what new powers to pick anyway.  Edit: But yes, I was around for the ""We don't talk about the Fire Tanker Club"" times... where we could solo farm an entire map of freakshow.  ...I soloed the respec trial at level 32."

Over thirty emotes that made roleplaying fun, and were useful for so many random situations. Rolling dice, fishing, even simple ones like leaning on a wall and several different sitting animations. Heck, using a jackhammer or turning into a pumpkin. It had it all.  I played GW2 for a while, and was always just shocked that it got by with less than a dozen emotes. Champions Online has a few good ones, but is missing some vital ones. Star Trek Online has a good variety, but is also missing some important ones (even some ones that are in CO, which is... just weird)."

On a tangential note, I was trying to place Rem's voice in the English dub of Death Note, and found out via IMDB that it was Mystique's voice actor. Not sure how it took me so long to make the connection. Anyway, I looked up some of the other cast and discovered that Death Note's voice cast is like an Evo reunion:   Nightcrawler = Light Yagami Gambit = L Mystique = Rem Dr. Eaton (I honestly don't remember who this bit-character was, though >_>) = Near   There are probably more, but I didn't check out every single character.

Cityofheroes,2p0yx6,Midoki,2,Fri Dec 12 21:20:54 2014 UTC,"If you're a fan of X-Men, sure!  It has a pretty good progression of events unfolding and shit getting more and more real as time goes on. There's a fair amount of filler, but most of that is pretty good.  Although the main cast is aged-down to high school, it doesn't make you suffer through a whole lot of ""...and prom's tomorrow!"" teenage drama storylines. Most characters who are mentor figures, like Professor X, Storm, Wolverine, etc. appear as adults so that they can retain that relationship. But at the same time, they managed not to turn them into boring teacher figures.  Generally, the plot is focused on shit that's going on relating to what Mystique or Magneto are up to, and after a certain point which I will keep ambiguous so as not to spoil it, the public becomes aware of mutants' existence and then they deal with that whole shitstorm. I like that they actually devoted time to the reveal and the fallout that it leads to, whereas a lot of other X-Men series tend to stick to ""public is aware"" or ""public is not aware"" from beginning to end. Evolution was brave enough to explore the actual turn of events as the secret comes out."

So there wasn't nearly as much 'man we can't wait' for Valiance as there was for CoT, IMO.  I had hoped the best for them, but... yeah.  Wrong timing, not enough presence, I'd say.  I hope their new PR/marketer can do them some good and get this restarted.    Good luck to Valiance!"

Also, the word that folks are in talks to buy CoH from NCsoft and relaunch is going to deter people from spending money on a spiritual sequel.  Still, I wish them the best of luck."
Cityofheroes,2nd09a,Narissis,1 point,Tue Nov 25 15:57:28 2014 UTC,"What do people mean by a COH spiritual successor? The game has been dead for years. At best these are tributes or homages, but those involved in trying to recreate City of Heroes didn't pool their resources and work together, so I doubt the spirit of the game will be restored with one if these myriad ""successors.""   Champions Online was the corporate successor. Whether we like it or not. Now I'm stuck with Marvel Heroes. How the mighty hath meh."
Cityofheroes,2nd09a,WHY_DONT_YOU_KNOW,2,Tue Nov 25 20:18:50 2014 UTC,"A spiritual successor doesn't have to recreate the original game. In fact, that would be antithetical to the term. That would be a remake.  A spiritual successor is a game that aims to fill a similar niche and provide a gameplay experience reminiscent of a franchise that is discontinued. They can be wildly different, however. For example, the Bioshock series is a spiritual successor to System Shock. Those games are different in many ways, but they have similar DNA, if that makes any sense."
Cityofheroes,2nd09a,Narissis,2,Tue Nov 25 20:42:10 2014 UTC,"No no, don't miss ZachsMind's best point:  People didn't pool resources or work together.  Egos got in the way of any spiritual successor.  Everything we have now, or upcoming, pales in comparison to what could've been if people had been a little less headstrong about what they thought was right."
Cityofheroes,2nd09a,TheParamount,1 point,Wed Nov 26 01:46:59 2014 UTC,"You guys are both right that the community got fractured and none of these games are likely to be as good as CoH deserves.  But that doesn't make them not spiritual successors. It just means the spiritual successor(s) aren't likely to be all that great. :/  I suppose we could make the argument that a split community makes them less true as spiritual successors because the community was a big part of what made CoH what it was...  My prediction is that one of these games will ultimately fail, though, which would bring everyone back together on the remaining one. At this point only time will tell."
Cityofheroes,2nd09a,Narissis,3,Wed Nov 26 15:23:10 2014 UTC,"There was an attempt to work together in the earliest phases of both games, but a simple tech decision was made that caused them to each go their separate ways.   In otherwords, ego had nothing to do with the space between CoT and Valiance Online. We are supportive of CoT and they are supportive of us, we're simply different games with different tech and style."

Cityofheroes,2nd09a,speed_boost_this,1 point,Sat Nov 29 17:17:36 2014 UTC,"They're not spiritual successors because they only share a genre. That's not the same as what I meant by a niche.  A spiritual successor is intended to capture the spirit and the essence of the gameplay experience. It needs to play like the original game that it's a successor to.  Going back to the System Shock / Bioshock examples, Bioshock really does feel like System Shock 2 to play. A simplified SS2, in a completely different setting, where Psi abilities have been replaced by Plasmids... but nonetheless, the overall experience is remarkably similar. If you took the plot of Bioshock and moved it out of Rapture and into space, it would be System Shock 3."
Cityofheroes,2nd09a,ZachsMind,1 point,Sat Nov 29 21:28:37 2014 UTC,Wikipedia has a workable definition with several examples that I'd say a majority of folks would agree with.    I'm not sure entirely sure what your definition is but it seems to be both time- and official-limited.  That's an overly restrictive usage of the term and not the typical definition.

Cityofheroes,2n69kb,azamean,8,Sun Nov 23 16:09:54 2014 UTC,"There are (very) slow efforts underway to try and get a private server running by reverse-engineering the client, but this would take a very long time to achieve (much longer than it would take for the relaunch after all is said and done).  At this point, I believe the reverse-engineering effort has only progressed to the character creator."

Then I remember I am absolutely terrible with anything software or hardware beyond what I need to just use a computer and I would probably somehow manage to blow up a non-physical entity or something."

The SWGEMU Project has made considerable progress and the game is currently playable, although it lacks Creature AI (being worked on heavily) and there is no Space combat, and no Jedi at the moment. So it is possible to recreate the server software entirely from the client software and resources found online plus the memories of those who played it heavily as to the details of functionality etc.   If they don't resurrect the game directly, I sincerely hope someone will get a project like SWGEMU to the point where COH is playable. I miss the game immensely."

It would have been an old build, but at least it would have been something to start on.   About a month or so after CoV came out, I got a call from NCsoft. Apparently, some clients when creating a new test server instance (full download) would actually download the whole source/devkit. They asked me to verify the files and delete them and reinstall the entire game. Got a nice t-Shirt, signed by dev team poster, and a letter thanking me for my cooperation.

Managed to get 6 of the original 8 members logged back in, so we kept going.  Got to the last mish, completed the TF, got the badge, hooray!  But since we were on the map with all the CoT portals we figured we'd clear them out for some easy xp... except just as we cleared the last portal, the map crashed and we were all booted out of the game.  And when we logged back in, half of us had lost the badge.

You could select any power, any class, as long as you had leveled up high enough to access that power. It made for amazing fun combinations that were very effective on teams or solo.   During head start, the buzz in game and on the beta - boards was crazy good, the game was such fun, and the announced 6 month and lifetime subs. I would guess from the reaction on the boards, teams I was on, they had tens of thousands of people buy in.   Then comes day 1 after head start. Massive patch. Skills across the board nerfed, choices removed, just utter and complete gutting of the game. Why? Jack Emmert is why, he wanted to make sure the game met his 3 white minions challenge out of the gate, and he had the reigns. Total bait and switch to get subs, then force his awful ideas on the game after they pulled in long term / lifetime subs.  But... wait... the game came with first month free. Why is that important to this story of CO's doom? Because that means the lifetime / long time subs didnt bill until end of the first month. Again I don't have numbers, but from the utter flop in morale on the boards, ghost town after a week on the servers, and complete lack of joy teaming in game, that virtually all of those who bought in, cancelled out.   I did. I was gone in a month, the game was changed from fun to lame by CO equivalent of ED on day 1 of release.   City of Heroes took years to fully recover from ""Statesman"" ED, CO died out of the gate. It could/would have been amazing if they stuck with the initial vision and built on it.  During head start I had a hoverboard flying jedi with a lightsaber, strangle, mind control, and telekenisis. A radiation regeneration fire tank. A fish-beast that could punch enemies a mile in the air and recover health while they flew. I would still be playing the damn game if they had just kept it fun with freedom of power choices, and built out the experience. Instead it was dead in months."

I spent hours playing in Atlas Park, virtually ignoring every other game at the convention. I couldn't wait for the game to come out a year later. Not knowing what server to choose at launch, i chose Protector, and was off an running. later on when Virtue was seen as a high population RP server, i ended up transferring or recreating my characters there. My first Character took 2 years to hit lvl 50, as i wanted to play my alts all old school, with little PLing, as i knew, their was very little post 50 content, and in COH it was the journey not the end game, and i was fine with that. I remember when the Hollows was introduced and other zones. But then it seemed the game devs just set the game on auto-pilot, and real content was lacking after a few years. I really enjoyed COV as well. What a great game compared to any other Comic Book based games to come after. I really hope we will see the like of COH and COV again."

Hamidon spawns Mito ""blooms"" at 75%, 50%, and 25% HP respectively, as you probably remember.   The devs designed the final Hamidon nucleus to be beaten where each of the 75/50/25% HP Mito spawns were to have the heroes withdraw from the cytoplasm (since the ""blooms"" spawn Mitos proportional to the number of heroes in the cytoplasm), so that the nucleus would only spawn a few (or no) Mitochondria.  This didn't work in practice, since getting 100 players to simultaneously withdraw from the cytoplasm during a raid (not once but three times) is a coordination nightmare, generally impractical due to lag related reasons.  So, in reality, you had players figure out mass snipes, mass holds, mass Warburg nukes, all of which lent themselves to the much more familiar tactics that CoH had taught them - stand tall, tank and spank down everything and anything.  edit: grammars"

This had the added benefit of being cheap because I have a short attention span and was rubbish with money. Turns out, you could basically hit Super speed levels with just sprint on and not have to worry about that stupid speed debuff for attacking.  If you hit Elude, you could cap run speed, still no speed suppression.  Fun fact I discovered with that build, If you queue up an attack while running at the enemy, you can often be in and out of retaliation range before they can do anything. I added huge amounts of knock back to the build and anything that could be knocked back ended up coming along with me when the animation activated.  It was hysterical.

Obviously you can't copy names and ideas directly, but will there be something close to, say, the Fortunata or Controller, two of my personal favorites?   How will (most) game content scale to the player? Is it the familiar 3 common NPC's vs 1 PC, or is some other metric being used? (and how essential will teaming be?) To what extent do you expect the game to utilize instancing and phasing?  Will levels provide more rigid gating like in CoH/CO, or looser gating like in most fantasy MMO's?  I don't expect PvP to be a big focus of your game, but could an option to create an insta-max level hero with decent-ish gear be taken into consideration? (Even make it so such a hero could only visit specific zones, like pvp zones, arena, and a supergroup base)  Semi-finally, I don't know if I should ask about what financial model you have in mind for your game at this current stage of development.  Finally, what's your favorite pen and paper RPG? (Alternately, what do you think of Arkham Horror, and RNG in general as it could be applied to MMO's)"
Cityofheroes,2kovio,ninjaofpatience,1 point,Fri Oct 31 00:00:44 2014 UTC,"There are semi-equivalent archetypes in our game including a few that were absent from the City Of games. One of the things I've pushed our systems lead into was taking a fresh look at the base abilities of the old AT's themselves and seeing what new and neat tricks we could pull out of them.   For example; one of our archetypes is the melee version of a support character. While that sounds strange, it actually works out quite well in conjunction with the way we have the various AT's set up.   Everything will scale at the player's discretion, much like was possible in CoH. We all enjoyed that system and couldn't find too much fault with it. The base for that scaling is the familiar 3:1 ratio..in most cases. In this it tends to vary by variety of NPC's the player is fighting (Think Rikti monkeys to AV-level characters). We wanted to be able to include some variety in the moment to moment gameplay.  And, this will probably come as a shock to some, but PvP is actually going to be well integrated into our late-game content. Naturally, we're not going to -force- anyone to participate in PvP, but for those who choose to it is going to be a more rewarding experience than CoH's Zone PvP was. We aren't releasing complete details on it yet, but we want to allow PC groups to be able to shape the landscape of our city to an extent. ;) Also, for the record, this is a no-gear game. Personally I hate the stupid grind-for-gear concept in a superhero game. It's contrary to what you see in comic books and so, doesn't belong in our world.  Now, having said that, to answer your question directly; we're likely not including the option to create a max-level character straight out of the gate. That tends to cause people to not understand how their characters' powers work, especially in the all-important team setting. However, unlike CoH, we've decided collectively that if players decide they want to do nothing but farm the heck out of mobs, well that's at their discretion. It's our job to provide the game, not tell people how they should play it. We hope the content and story arcs are interesting enough that people will want to play them, but let's be honest, after a while we all spent some amount of time farming in AE, RV, PI, or Grandville.   Levels in our game are structured in such a way that you know what you'll be getting access to at each level, though the choices that you make within that structure are fairly loose to allow you to design your character the way you want (for RP purposes, Min-Max farming/PvP builds, lulz, whatever :D ).   As for financial model, we have a game with the old school MMO feel (though much shinier graphics), and we're a small indy studio so the best option on our table at the moment is the one we're going with. Monthly subscription with full access (read: No money-grab cash shop). We're looking at trial accounts to see if we can support the potential load because we want people to be able to try the game out. We're not trying to hide any sneaky tricks up our sleeves.  You had to go and mention Lovecraft didn't you? I have a rock hard geek over Lovecraft in all his forms, being his writings, things based on his work (I'm looking at you, Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu), and of course the Mythos in general. That said, my favorite Pen 'n Paper remains Cyberpunk 2020, because so few games really made you feel like a badass as well as that one did.  As far as the RNG in MMO's, it will forever depend on the type of game that is being made. We want to emulate the RPG side of MMO's so it's there but the player can apply some fairly intuitive control over it. We know many games are doing away with the RNG system, but there are some applications where lacking that slight random factor just causes a game to lose a little bit of it's 'magic' if you will."

Cityofheroes,2kkq89,Remmib,3,Tue Oct 28 18:15:44 2014 UTC,Where did this 'Valiance Online' come about from? Fan recreation/reimagining of CoH?  So weird to see 'Atlas Park' with those graphics and all of the very similar animations.
Cityofheroes,2kkq89,Riddla26,3,Tue Oct 28 22:53:16 2014 UTC,This has been around since the announcement of the Closure of CoH.  It was going to be another fantasy MMO but the devs were apparently CoH fans and changed to superheroes when NCSoft shut down Paragon.  They were mentioned in the New Efforts/The Mask Comes off posts at cohtitan.com recently.

We've been doing a ton of work on this game over the last year and, while still far from complete, it's nice to say we have somewhere that you can run around in again.  We do have our Kickstarter opening tomorrow, for those of you on that evil Facebook scheme (totally a Nemesis plot), watch for the link to pop up. If I don't go completely space case before then, I'll swing back by and post a link for you all here as well.  Cheers!"
Cityofheroes,2km5p1,Hirsty3359,2,Tue Oct 28 22:23:17 2014 UTC,"Looking from a stat and power synergy perspective, I would do fire/fire. Fire/fire can make some nice rounded builds with either defense or recharge, but its a little cliche.   Stone/energy is a more interesting combination, but suffers the pitfalls of the -rech,-dam,-speed; only one the three weaknesses can be remedied by IOs per build.   Elec/Elec always seems cool (Elec melee is my favorite melee set), but Elec Armor isn't that great of a set.   I would avoid Kinetics altogether because, even though it look fantastic, its animation time is a killer and gets rather annoying after a while."
Cityofheroes,2km5p1,Mgas95,1 point,Wed Oct 29 03:37:15 2014 UTC,"Thanks - what would you recommend going with Stone then? (Armour)  And in regards to the Tank/Brute thing, which would you suggest?"
Cityofheroes,2km5p1,Mgas95,1 point,Wed Oct 29 10:07:13 2014 UTC,"Super strength is good with stone. IOing for recharge allows for a perma(or semi perma) rage, this solves both the -dam and -recharge issue. Getting teleport for travel power would replace the need to fix the -speed issue.   As for brute vs tank, it's all about preference. The brute would give better damage but a lower defense, and a tank would give the reverse. But I would say go with tank, because the main issue with stone is that your pretty useless until you get granite armor. A tank will get granite armor at 32 as opposed to brutes who get it at 38. Those extra six levels of granite armor are essential to being a productive team member in the 27+ Game, with regard to Enhancements, TFs, and exemplaring."
Cityofheroes,2km5p1,Mgas95,1 point,Wed Oct 29 19:13:46 2014 UTC,here's a photo of the build I had made for my Stone/SS Tank  http://i.imgur.com/iNgeR6E.png
Cityofheroes,2km5p1,imverybadatmath,1 point,Thu Oct 30 00:12:07 2014 UTC,"I enjoyed playing Brute much more than Tank over the course of the game, it was generally tanky enough for almost all teams, and was able to put out serious damage. My favorite combination was Electric attack / Shield defense, the double PBAoE attack combined with fury was quite amazing, and the powers outside of that were excellent. In most cases I liked Defense better than Resist, it just felt better to me to be dodging left and right while laying out damage.  Stone tank is a fantastic teammate, but is really tough to play outside of teams due to either relatively weak tanking without granite, or low damage with it. SS has the best self-buffs to damage, Dark Melee the best buffs to tankiness (lowering accuracy, helps your out of granite armor be more effective).   Fire/Fire is excellent solo and usually a really good teammate, nice mix without the godmode Granite allows.  Elec/Elec has some holes, some godmode (vs elec/nrg), and nice powers. Love the attack set, the armor is a bit tricky but doable.  I had maxed out: (attack/defense)   elec/shield brute (two PBAoE teleport attacks, extremely nice defense) fire/stone tank (super tanky, played when teams needed a self sufficient godmode tank) mace/dark armor brute (just because the endurance was insane, i built it then IOd away all the end problems, while boosting him to excellence. he was a personal challenge, and a combination i didnt see anyone else play) dark melee/stone brute (super defense, excellent damage, IOd her run speed to max, was faster than normal run while in granite) stone/willpower tank (another personal challenge, wanted to see how playable i could make willpower, and loved the stone animation on the character)"

I did get him to fifty before the very end, teaming up for radio mishes in peregrine island, I think.

What comes across as a little odd isn't what was said but the need to say it.  Its not like the NCSoft deal is carved in stone, posting a thanks-but-no-thanks to an offer that hasn't even officially been made to them yet feels a little knee-jerk reactionary to me.   Again, I see no problem with VO's decision to go their own way and from what I've seen of their product trying to shoehorn CoH-IP back into their work would likely be more difficult for them than for the other CoH-esque projects.

Cityofheroes,2fsg6a,Ineebu,6,Mon Sep 8 17:12:05 2014 UTC,"I was just discussing this TODAY with my brother. I would definitely replay my favorite 50s.  All time favorite character is my first brute I played. I didn't realize just how good brutes were,  so I rolled a combo that I felt would be different, but potent.  Fire melee/ electric armor.   You don't realize the strength of the brute until you have full fury and can hit a group with fire sword circle. My only complaint was the lack of endurance I had when needing to keep my fury up. Lo and behold, at level 35, power sink effectively gave me unlimited endurance. Although the survivability wasn't always the BEST,  I probably had more fun with this character than any other.  Controller- fire control/ radiation emission  Good mixture of control, debuffs and damage. I ultimately rolled this character for pvp,  but this was one of my favorite pve builds. Flash fire + fire cages + radiation debuffs was a lock down combo. Add in fire imps and accelerate metabolism and for a controller, you were doing some nice damage.   TLDR- fire melee/ electric armor brute and fire control/radiation controller with my name on it"
Cityofheroes,2fsg6a,damienkellis,1 point,Mon Sep 8 17:44:29 2014 UTC,"Thunderphoenix was electric melee/fire armor.  I suspect this was not quite as effective.  I'm sure I was debt capped most of the way to 50.  Still loads of fun, though."

Cityofheroes,2fsg6a,damienkellis,1 point,Mon Sep 8 07:44:05 2014 UTC,Masterminds were fun but if you didn't have a complex set of keybinds for them they were impossible to play well.

Cityofheroes,2fsg6a,SurrealSam,1 point,Mon Sep 8 20:24:14 2014 UTC,It's important to have key binds for even regular teaming.   Soloing you can get away with.  They have a tendency to run about and agro multiple mobs.

Cityofheroes,2fsg6a,bla2bla1bla,3,Mon Sep 8 23:26:55 2014 UTC,"Kinetic/Sonic Defender  One of the most important drivers for me is that I hate playing on high level teams without a good kin. Having a player that double a team's damage output (assuming they're playing like they know the glory of fulcrum shift) is invaluable. It's irreplaceable.   Sonic blast for defenders just has its own family of unfairness. The damage increase you get on a full team is ridiculous. While I've every other secondary, they all feel suboptimal.  But the biggest thing for me is that with my previous Kin/Sonic, he at about the highest level incarnate that I ever obtained, and his build didn't use a single set IO. In a way he was a protest character. I hated the power imbalance at the upper echelon of min maxed IO builds, so I played a min maxed SO build that I could bring on even the most powerful teams with nobody batting an eye. Of all my characters he was the one that got the most compliments.  The only real downside to him is that I hated playing him on anything less than +2 difficulty. It's impossible to keep the team near the damage cap without pumping the difficulty up, so I felt like I was half assing it."

I wouldn't mind taking the tine to level him up from scratch. My father's nickname had been Tiny. He had died a few years before. I made that toon in memory of my father.

For the longest time I personally viewed the melee classes as the engines-of-destruction Scrappers/Brutes, and for giggles they bring along their slower, dumber, wimpier Stalker cousins now and then.

Bio Armor was/is a hideously ugly armor set but ugly in an interesting way, was looking forward to playing that one before the closure announcement.  Second, a Dual Pistol/Martial Combat blaster.  Not a big fan of the pistol set, the damage output seems subpar, the mechanics of ammo-switching ened up lackluster because you're almost always better staying at incendiary ammo even vs fire-resistant critters, but it fits the concept I have in mind.   Third, a plant/nature controller.  Not exactly a surprising, risque combo but again it fits a concept I have in mind, had a plant dominator for the longest time whose origin was something like a mix of Solomon Grundy and Swamp Thing, a former hero who died and came back as a planty-zombie dom.  Some old characters will be rerolled exactly as before, some will be rerolled with some tweaks (my main and first character ever was an en/en blaster, in hindsight I always wished she had been rolled as an FF/en defender, so that is what she will become), and some will be gracefully retired to live on only in memory.  But mostly I want to play some of the new powersets first."
Cityofheroes,2fsg6a,crossedx,1 point,Wed Sep 10 22:09:38 2014 UTC,"I had every X/Storm Controller in the game at max level. I also had every Fire/X Controller at max, every Fire/X Dominator at max, every Earth/X controller to max, and every Earth/X Dom at max. Also most of the Storm defenders and/or corruptors. And all the combos with Super Strength that were possible too.  So I guess I would start there.  If I had to pick just one, probably Fire/Storm. Or maybe Illusion/Storm. Or Earth/Storm. Or Ice/Storm.  sigh"

What type of blaster I'm really not sure. If it were to be an I24 version of the game then I'd go for a water blast/martial combat character. Otherwise I might just remake my main and go with energy blast/devices."

Cityofheroes,2fp6hx,Cassirer,6,Sun Sep 7 09:47:41 2014 UTC,"I'll play devil's advocate to maybe help explain to you the downvotes you're getting.  NCSoft executives do not give a flying hoot about a few thousands of fans paying $15 a month. They want more profitable games that cater to hundreds of thousands of fans (e.g. Lineage, Aion, Guild Wars 2)   Close to shutdown, City of Heroes was reputed to have roughly the same revenue as Guild Wars 1. This might seem fine until you take into account that GW1 hadn't released any paid content releases from 2007 and was run by a skeleton crew. CoH on the other hand churned out two expansion packs and was running via subscriptions until 2011, and maintained an active development team.  Any business owner comparing those two is going to deem that CoH runs a (potentially unacceptable) low profit margin proportional to the capital gains and investments you've put into it.  Something to keep in mind perhaps. I'm just as unhappy as you are about the shutdown, but let's take something away from the whole experience."
Cityofheroes,2fp6hx,SurrealSam,3,Sun Sep 7 16:24:53 2014 UTC,"Nicely said!   NCSoft should have pushed to move the game into maintenance mode (simply keeping the servers running with no new content) for the existing players.    I feel bad for the 80 employees of Paragon Studios, but no MMO should die like CoH."

Cityofheroes,2f76vq,seahole,17,Mon Sep 1 21:10:40 2014 UTC,"TLDR for the impatient:  Korean corporate culture delayed many things, the people interested in buying the CoH IP were told to wait until August back in March. The only possibility of any such deal being reached is by spinning the license off into its own company.  However at the end of the day, everything is still up in the air, nothing is confirmed, nothing is denied, nothing is signed.   Don't hold your breath people."
Cityofheroes,2f76vq,Cassirer,1 point,Mon Sep 1 21:42:10 2014 UTC,"how is this ""korean corporate culture"" approach remotely profitable for anybody? how is that behavior beneficial at all?"
Cityofheroes,2f76vq,ZachsMind,1 point,Tue Sep 9 19:55:20 2014 UTC,"Business 101: If you piss off your negotiating partner, you won't go very far in the world. Be professional, learn about the other company/culture you're talking to, then negotiate.   As they said in the post, it's considered rude in Korea to go speak/email the higher echelon staff of a company directly without first being introduced with a local referral, so all this stuff ended up taking time.  As for how it's profitable or beneficial, I have no clue as I'm not familiar with Asian business practices in general. The bottom line is that they're the ones with the power and possess the source code for CoH, so if people want their precious game back, they'd better learn how to brown nose and suck up to the Koreans."
Cityofheroes,2f76vq,Cassirer,8,Tue Sep 9 20:27:57 2014 UTC,"Well, I will be honest....  None of this excites me very much at all. In fact, it is one of the least interesting possibilities in the whole ""Getting COH back"" concept in my personal opinion. Don't get me wrong, I know there is a lot of people out there who simply want to play the game again. There are people who miss being able to load up that screen, hear that music, and make character after character after character.  And I am one of them! But ""Maintenance Mode"" just sounds depressing to me. No hope of new content ever, just a functional ""Way Back Machine"" of City of Heroes for old time's sake. I didn't even sign on to COH in it's final hour, because I had already said my good byes by that point. And yes, I know that at least it'd be SOMETHING, as there is currently no hope of new content either. I'm just saying, to reiterate, this news just told me ""Definitely nothing new if we get it back"" and that takes away a lot of the appeal to me.  I mean, realistically...what would I do? Log in, make a character, fly around a bit, and say ""yeah! I'm a super hero again! er...now what?"" The beauty of MMORPGs is the community and the updates. And with one of those out of the equation and all of my own personal friends from the game gone, it doesn't really excite me to be able to go down memory lane only.  The other news is a LITTLE more exciting, about the possibility of a COH 1.5 or a COH 2. That is something that I assumed was dead forever with no possibility, so if this opens the doors for that, I am intrigued a little bit. But then I am once again cautious in my anticipation as so far I haven't seen ANYTHING from any of the ""spiritual successors"" that has made me go ""Woah! This is gonna be great!"". They lack art direction and some of the people involved seem very amateur.  I'm honestly not trying to be cold here, I'm just keeping my own expectations and interest in all of this very low. I would love to be shown a new product that blows the original COH away, but so far I have seen tech demos and even those are just someone piddling around in Unreal Editor.  What I was hoping for was that the ""hail mary team"" was something like Cryptic or old Paragon Studios (preferably the latter) development members trying to buy it. People that I could see actually DOING something with the property that might actually be a sequel.  As it stands, it still sounds like people who are just passionate fans of the game (nothing wrong with that, of course) who want it back. And while I admire that perseverance and would LOVE to see people who desperately want to play again be able to do so, I am still in wait and see mode.  I wonder how much these people are investing in this. Because I hope this passionate fanbase is significantly more passionate than me or they are gonna stand to lose a lot of money. They'll have to charge something if they can't develop a F2P style cash shop on the old game (EDIT: To clarify - a way to add new items, I realize the game did have a cash shop before it shut down they could feasibly bring back up). And since the game had already went free, that may be something people are unwilling to do.  TL;DR: I am happy for folks who want to play COH again. I am unhappy with a maintenance mode only option. But I suppose it is better than nothing...or is it?"
Cityofheroes,2f76vq,ripshit_on_ham,3,Tue Sep 2 18:27:50 2014 UTC,I agree with most of this post unfortunately. I'll log in and it'll be fun for awhile... But boredom will set in I'm sure.  And any talk of CoX 2.0 brings with it all the fears any sequel would. Will it even feel similar but still refreshing? Will it even be fun?
Cityofheroes,2f76vq,MindReaver5,6,Wed Sep 3 14:28:40 2014 UTC,"So there's going to be an effort to spin up an i23 server in maintenance mode.   Meanwhile the other projects (City of Titans and Heroes & Villains) will also have access to the CoH intellectual property for their own games.   I'm not sure that three projects all competing for the same audience is a long-term strategy for success, but I'll be happy to be wrong."
Cityofheroes,2f76vq,DWRoelands,8,Mon Sep 1 21:51:42 2014 UTC,"I think the most important thing (for me) is CoH 1.5, which will be CoH transferred to the new engine and presumably revived from maintenance mode."
Cityofheroes,2f76vq,CaesarBritannicus,3,Mon Sep 1 21:59:14 2014 UTC,"I think the intention is, since this is the owner of the CoHTitan project (either leading or a part of) they will combine CoHTitan and COH into CoH1.5"
Cityofheroes,2f76vq,petrofire,2,Mon Sep 1 22:15:41 2014 UTC,"No. He states that they plan to migrate COH to the unreal engine where Atlas Park Revival will become COH1.5. The hope of which is to start with Issue 23 and continue to develop the game from there. Irish_Girl on the forums is the lead for APR and she has been posting information that she has in that regard.  City of Titans will remain a separate game, however, as Downix stated the plan to move COH's IP to a licensing company will allow COT to become part of the COH universe, essentially becoming COH2.0. He also states the other spiritual successors would be free to license the IP as well if they so choose."
Cityofheroes,2f76vq,ZipperDoDa,4,Tue Sep 2 07:15:23 2014 UTC,"CoT will be keeping their own Lore though, so different engine, different power system, different archtypes, different lore adds up to not quite coh2..."
Cityofheroes,2f76vq,skippy7721,5,Tue Sep 2 12:46:27 2014 UTC,I think Downix himself probably hoped this announcement would be more of a bombshell than it was but hey...things change. They didn't expect things to take as long as they have but the good news is hope is still there.
Cityofheroes,2f76vq,foundingvaters,4,Mon Sep 1 21:30:27 2014 UTC,"So, assuming the deal actually occurs:  1) Issue 23 server comes back online 2) No updates to the I24 content 3) No word yet on how we gain access (subscription or other) 4) CoX content eventually migrated to City of Titans engine 5) CoT, Valliance, H&V and Atlas Park Revival have access to licensing if they wish to use names, NPCs, lore, etc (what if each takes the lore in a different, and conflicting direction)? 6) Nothing settled yet  So, just a taste of information, more about the history and who is involved with a very vague set of future goals.  Better than nothing I guess.  Still can't see why Windows 9 is a problem for them.  They didn't say the old engine wouldn't work in Windows 9, just that it was ""unsuitable"".  Unless Windows 9 completely removes pre-opengl 3.0 functionality, it should continue to work."

Cityofheroes,2f76vq,houtex727,4,Tue Sep 2 04:52:30 2014 UTC,"Yes. That is absolutely it. He wants to show people (probably those from the game that disliked him) how important he is, and how ""in-the-know"" he is.   As I've stated before, he is a guy who's very passionate about CoH, but I guess he figures if he can get a bit of attention by attaching himself to it, why not go for it?"

There was some back and forth about whether it was his right to post anything and stir up as much excitement as it did. TonyV had some things to say about it (as one of the few ""informants"") on the titan forums and there was a lot of discussion, drama and speculation that spun from it.  Needless to say it caused more ripples than a simple ""This is who we are and this is what's happening at the moment"" announcement deserved and Robert got a lot of attention from it. With how excited Robert appeared to be in his post it unnecessarily raised expectations from the announcement."
