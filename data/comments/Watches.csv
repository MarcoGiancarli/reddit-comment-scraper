Watches,3e2kr6,HyperManFromSpace,4,Tue Jul 21 13:51:46 2015 UTC,Love the red seconds hand. Adds some warmth.
Watches,3e2kr6,f4890,2,Tue Jul 21 15:58:18 2015 UTC,"Brrathwait, THERES MORE!!!"
Watches,3e2kr6,Aevum1,5,Tue Jul 21 18:54:57 2015 UTC,I think that the Brathwait beats the living shit out of DW in pretty much every conceivable way.
Watches,3e2kr6,keithcozz,0,Tue Jul 21 14:11:14 2015 UTC,"How is it superior though? I always thought DW had a chinese quartz movement, but apparently it's japanese. Surely there can't be much difference between swiss and japanese quartz movements? Especially not in a relatively cheap fashion watch that'll be discarded once something breaks. I've held neither, so I can't speak about build quality, though.  I do agree it's slightly prettier, but I don't see the point in getting the old high horse out when we're talking about quartz movement fashion watches in the <$200 range."
Watches,3e2kr6,closerinspection,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:06:19 2015 UTC,"Even without talking about build-quality, the Swiss Ronda movement and sapphire crystal pretty much end the discussion.  Here is a nice little write-up about BRATHWAIT."
Watches,3e2kr6,keithcozz,5,Tue Jul 21 16:26:27 2015 UTC,Still prefer the DW when it comes to appearance.

When considering that Brathwait is as /u/keithcozz says, superior in every way, the choice wasn't that hard."

Watches,3e2jwo,Jaubin9422,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:52:25 2015 UTC,"I found time to take a decent shot of this watch this morning while waiting for some coffee. This being my first serious watch purchase, I can't help but love it. It doesn't get much wrist time due to my Hamilton auto khaki I've had for a while now. I just wanted to share. I just love how the light can really show off the blue.    On a side note, I've yet to find another strap I really like with it. The best and most comfortably I've found is this black NATO so far. Please excuse the white of my bowewdddyyyy! Lol  Enjoy and let me know what you think!   -M"
Watches,3e2yec,Tomes2789,6,Tue Jul 21 15:38:27 2015 UTC,"So This is my Deep Blue Alpha Marine 500, with a full-lume dial and Swiss Automatic movement. Specifically, it is rocking the ETA 2824-2 movement, and it keeps great time (only about +/- 3-5 seconds a day). Further, really impressed with the smoothness of the second-hand sweep.  Deep Blue is by far my favorite watch brand, and this is my favorite of the 5 Deep Blues that I own. For those that don’t know, Deep Blue is an American professional dive watch company who pride themselves on making seriously-functional dive watches. They actually supply the divers for National Geographic with the dive watches they wear while filming for the network. This specific model has a depth rating of 500M.  The real beauty of this model, in my opinion, is the full-lume dial (http://imgur.com/dmdkKxZ). Deep Blue’s lame is honestly the best I have ever personally seen. You can literally see the blue glow in bright sunlight, and in the dark it’s a literal flashlight.  In short, I really wanted to share one of my favorite watches of my collection with my friends here at /r/watches, and I hope you guys like checking it out!! I just finished putting this mesh bracelet on it (also made by Deep Blue) and it totally changes the entire watch’s feel and look compared to the original 3-link bracelet.   Thanks again for taking the time to check out my watch!!"
Watches,3e2yec,LogicWavelength,3,Tue Jul 21 15:41:09 2015 UTC,...is the date wheel lumed as well?
Watches,3e2yec,LogicWavelength,3,Tue Jul 21 15:54:54 2015 UTC,"Nah it's not, but that would be REALLY cool!!. The lume is insane though as-is, so I can't really complain haha Turns out it does! Good call! Never even realized that somehow. I love /r/watches :)"
Watches,3e2cuw,ButteryLou,2,Tue Jul 21 12:37:39 2015 UTC,"Just received my Orient Mako USA in the mail yesterday and its a beauty in person. I must admit I was a little hesitant about pre-ordering it after seeing some in hand pictures but I couldn't be happier with it and I plan on it being my daily watch. I purchased a Nato strap and I was thinking about grabbing a rubber strap as well, but after struggling to get the bracelet back onto the watch last night I'm not so keen on switching it out often. If anyone has any advice as to how to get those stubborn end links back onto the watch it would be much appreciated!  I didn't think my iPhone's camera would show how sharp this watch really is so I thought a time lapse of the sweep would be something cool. I hope you guys enjoy!"
Watches,3e2cuw,keithcozz,2,Tue Jul 21 12:42:03 2015 UTC,"I was initially not a fan of the recessed crystal (even though it makes sense), but after sizing the bracelet (which doggedly stays attached to the watch) and putting it on, I have to admit that I've fallen in love with the darn thing.  Best money I've spent in a while."
Watches,3e2cuw,namisdavid,2,Tue Jul 21 13:41:16 2015 UTC,Beautiful watch. I received the blue Mako USA last week and couldn't be happier with it. Replaced the bracelet with a few NATO straps and I now have a NATO strap for almost all occasions.
Watches,3e2cuw,tinIVoxide,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:17:48 2015 UTC,Is it normal for the minute hand to be in between minutes when the second hand is at 12?
Watches,3e2cuw,Mgotham,2,Tue Jul 21 14:32:09 2015 UTC,"Afaik the second hand isn't ever really set on most watches, so it sort of does its own thing."
Watches,3e2cuw,GhostalkerS,2,Tue Jul 21 14:40:07 2015 UTC,"As I figured out when setting mine the other day, the two aren't really connected. So pull the crown out when the second hand is at 12 and set the minute hand to the hash mark."
Watches,3e2cuw,Mgotham,2,Tue Jul 21 14:44:08 2015 UTC,This works on hacking watches. The Orient Ray has a non hacking movement. You can kind of stop the second hand by turning the crown the 'wrong' way a touch.
Watches,3e2cuw,camoriet,2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:18 2015 UTC,"Ah, didn't realize. But wouldn't the same thing work if you set the minute hand and wait for the second hand to hit 12 before you push the crown back in? Does the minute hand disengage when the crown is pulled out or...?   I honestly don't know much about this. The only reason I figured it out is bc I got a Seiko 5 last week (hacking) and noticed that the minute hand was between markers when the second hand hit 12. Then I realized what was going on."

Watches,3e21ey,keithcozz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:30 2015 UTC,The Skeleton uses a Fluco deployment clasp from Holben's Fine Watch Bands (my preferred brand and supplier!).  The Sun & Moon uses a generic rose gold deployment from ChronoWorld. Holbens do rose gold clasps but only higher end ones which cost 2x as much.
Watches,3e21ey,madaday,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:00 2015 UTC,I really cannot believe the price on these watches.... ridiculously affordable for something really cool.

The hamilton like the xetum was a gift from my wife. I recently changed the band to a black nato strap from a metal bracelet which was pretty uncomfortable and ""cheap"" looking. I think it really pops with this band vs the metal one."

So I figured why not. it was about half off the MSRP so very affordable to me. (Amazon link) I like the texture of the case, and the metal band. I pulled 5 links off, and now it fits perfectly.

This is my second mechanical watch. The second gift from my aunt. My current watches that I dual-wield are an IWC and an Apple Watch (might post those later).  Why frustrating? Omega service in New Jersey has screwed up repair a few times. The latest one you can see is in the Date window: on a few days, such as SUN here, the date fails to fully fall into the window, and I can't advance the day via the side button either on days like this.   Any experiences on Omega service? At some point I'll probably send it back in for repair, but honestly it almost doesn't feel worth it as the last major repair I had was about half the watch's price."

However, from what I've read, stay away from the boutiques around here, because they all send it to Secaucus repair facility, which has had nothing but complaints.  That being said, the date alignment issue should most definitely be covered under the warranty. Take it back and they should fix it.  I've heard the best thing to do is to take it to the boutique in NYC (the one on fifth avenue) because they have their own in-house repair facility that does excellent work. It might even be worth seeing if the NYC facility will fix the date alignment issue you're having.  Good luck with your fix!"
Watches,3e0pda,keekmonster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:25 2015 UTC,I don't have any advice but I've heard people around here talk a lot of shit about Omega servicing in NJ before.

This morning I was checking out the movement and to my disappointment, saw what appears to be a loose/broken piece of plastic sitting on top of the rotor(im told this is the movement holder but I'm relatively new to watches so I'm not 100% positive?) I'm not sure how it came loose as I've been pretty gentle with it since I've got it. The functionality of the watch appears to be fine but im assuming this will need fixed. I purchased this watch as a display model without any of the warranty papers (of course) so I'm guessing I'm not covered under citizens warranty for this watch. Would anyone have a rough estimate on the cost of a repair like this and if it can be replaced by a metal holder?  Any insight would be appreciated!

Watches,3dyxch,Monkeylabs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:59:20 2015 UTC,"So after stupidly buying an Invicta, and guiding myself onto my first Seiko, I decided to get a vintage dress watch. The 2870 Moonphase caught my eye, however I thought the face would be slightly bigger for a men's watch. I got it for $100. It was made in the 70s and 80s and I'm digging it so far. Only concern is it is slightly feminine for a men's watch but I'll love it none the less. I love the casing and the design of the watch. It will get a lot of use on Sunday at church and for formal events. I have two Seiko 5s on the way and my Timex just arrived so bless my poor wallet.

Watches,3dz8d7,Kippski,5,Mon Jul 20 18:58:56 2015 UTC,"Hello, /r/Watches.  This is my Orient Ray in black with beautiful Long Island in the background.  I was deciding between this watch and the Seiko SKX007K2.  Coincidentally, moments before I was going to buy the Seiko, a gentleman came to my police headquarters with the same watch in the Pepsi Cola colorway.  I politely asked to see his watch, explained there is nowhere to go physically see and try the watch on, and he was very enthusiastic about letting my try it on.  The Jubilee bracelet didn't suit my style although it was comfortable.  I also did not like how the Seiko comes up higher than the Ray.  I ended up going with the Orient.  I've been wearing it for two weeks now and I absolutely love this watch.  I only gain about 30 seconds a day and even then I only adjust it every two days or so.  The lume is actually pretty ridiculous.  It is bright and lasts almost the whole night (tested this while riding EMS).  I would absolutely recommend this watch to someone looking for a sophisticated, entry-level mechanical.  I also ordered a NATO strap from cheapestnatostraps.com and it should arrive in 10 years since I live in New Jersey and it ships from Sweden."

Watches,3e21x9,keithcozz,2,Tue Jul 21 14:08:03 2015 UTC,This is my first time changing the strap as I just received some new straps and the tool to change them. I think this brings a bit more dimension to this Seiko 5 SNK809 compared to the standard black strap. I also like the feel of the nato strap and I did not even realise before how easy it is to change them when you have installed the first one. This is my current beater watch and it's the 3rd watch in my collection (currently out of 5).  I ordered 7 different nato straps with two different widths so I will be experimenting more on a couple of watches. I have been on vacation for 2 weeks now and I have already bought 2 watches in addition to those 7 straps so maybe I should go back to work soon before I spend all my money :)

I love the watch's history; it was a special time in the world when we landed on the moon and the idea that this model was out there makes me sit and think about how amazing it must have been.  Space, time, spacetime, space travel, astronomy etc, to me, are wonderful, amazing, humbling things to think about.   All that having been said, I sit at a desk all day.  The closest I'll come to space travel is reading blogs, looking at pictures, and wearing my watch.  I used my chronograph once to test the accuracy of my car's speedometer, that's it.  Sometimes, I pull my phone out of my pocket to check the time rather than my wrist.  But all of that, and that Buzz had some negative things to say about it, doesn't really add or subtract to that first paragraph. I just really love my Speedmaster."

This is the Speedy that was worn by Captain Eugene Cernan in 1972 during the Apollo 17 mission, which was the last manned moon landing. Capt. Cernan was the 11th person to step foot on the moon, and also the last to ever do so (he was the last one back in the lunar landing module), meaning this was the last watch on the moon.  This watch is on display at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida. I found it pretty interesting and I thought I would share!

Watches,3dvvaa,jdd32,29,Mon Jul 20 01:44:45 2015 UTC,"It allows you to calculate how many times something repeats in an hour. For eample, if doing X once takes 30 seconds, then tachymeter tells you that it may be done 120 times in an hour (twice in a minute * 60 = 120). This can also be used to roughly calculate speed. For example, you somehow know when you have travelled a mile. If you've traveled a mile in, say, 40 seconds, then tachymeter tells you that you are able to ""repeat"" that 90 times per hour, i.e. you're travelling with 90mph (60s/40s = 1,5 miles per minute * 60 = 90mph).  Edit: Tachymeter scale basically gives you the values of a function f(x) = (60/x)*60 = 3600/x in the range [1,60], with x denoting the elapsed seconds. Some tachymeter scales continue into the second minute, e.g. to 1""15', where tachymeter would say 48.  Edit 2: What I wanted to point out is that tachymeters are not just there to calculate the speed or distance of moving. I could be, for example, folding origami swans. If each takes me 35 seconds, tachymeter tells me I'll be able to make 3600/35 = ~100 swans per hour."

I just changed the strap to this brown leather one today, also have a black leather and a grey ""perlon"" style nylon strap . It wears well; the watch has a good weight to it.

I went with this partly because it's my fourth Rolex in my collection so I could play around a bit. I have a GMT, a YM, and an Explorer. But I also got it because it's so uncommon. It's not a usual Rolex you see around  and it doesn't come up online often. In fact I've never seen someone else with my watch either online or in person, which I like a lot. For example a lot of my friends have submariners so I didn't look at the no-date because of that. And probably the last reason is that I find the blue gorgeous and I really like simple watches so with this way I could get a blue, simple Rolex which was perfect for me."

Watches,3dznyk,MedZach,4,Tue Jul 21 12:32:51 2015 UTC,"I have both right now! The green mechanical and the 38mm black auto on leather. They actually feel pretty different despite being so similar (if that makes any sense). The auto definitely has a more refined feel to it with the polished/brushed case and polished hands. As the other guy said, the display back is pretty cool (though I think this makes it less ""field"" like). The mechanical is thinner, but flatter in profile and with a longer lug-to-lug distance so it wears larger. The case is bead blasted which is pretty unique and gives it a less refined look. This is matched by the painted hands. My mechanical was off by about 20 seconds when I first got it, but I adjusted it myself to less than 3s off per day. My auto is off by about 15s per day. I think the choice depends on how you will use it. The auto is more versatile and refined (better for dressing it up a bit) but the mechanical is pretty cool from the field perspective. I hope this helps!"
Watches,3dznyk,deployant,2,Tue Jul 21 01:14:53 2015 UTC,"This probably accounts for the price difference as well. I would also expect a Swiss watch of this calibre to be a little better regulated, considering that my Orient Chicane is never off by more than 5 secs per day."
Watches,3e13v2,commanderpopnfresh,3,Tue Jul 21 03:41:04 2015 UTC,"Regarding a NATO/strap adapter: Nope, not unless you design it yourself.  As for dating it, I don't know, but you can often find old Hamilton catalogs online and so you could browse through those. I'd guess the mid to late 1980s."
Watches,3e00ud,bwt3,22,Mon Jul 20 22:23:00 2015 UTC,I believe that watch and that strap to be ill-matched.  That ZULU is simply overpowering the watch it is on.
Watches,3e00ud,keithcozz,-4,Mon Jul 20 22:31:12 2015 UTC,"See, I thought it was pretty well matched. The 4220 is a mid-size reference that was sold to POW's during WW2, so I thought the military inspired strap was a fun homage. I actually have two 4220's, the other is on a simple black leather strap. I intend to wear this one a bit this summer casually.  I have small wrists, so I enjoy wearing the mid-size vintage pieces."
Watches,3e00ud,SaabFan87,10,Mon Jul 20 22:38:23 2015 UTC,"Conceptually i agree with you. However the strap ""looks"" larger than the watch making it look even smaller than it is."
Watches,3e00ud,nephros,6,Mon Jul 20 22:45:49 2015 UTC,"Also not a fan.  Try a Perlon, ""Bund"" or leather slip-through (""leather RAF"" if you will) - those are actually period and less likely to look too massive for the watch like that one does."
Watches,3e00ud,didntwinTHATbig,7,Mon Jul 20 22:58:49 2015 UTC,"It's a good idea, but the strap totally distracts from the watch."
Watches,3e00ud,Major_Burnside,9,Mon Jul 20 22:52:16 2015 UTC,"Strap is WAY too big for that watch. It looks like you're wearing a leather cuff with a charm on it. The watch should be the focal point, not the strap.   In my humble opinion."
Watches,3e00ud,Magikarpeles,7,Mon Jul 20 23:11:50 2015 UTC,strap is obviously way too big for that watch. I mean just look at how it bunches up at the lugs.
Watches,3e00ud,brolex_rektsplorer,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:20:45 2015 UTC,"The lug width is 17mm, which makes finding straps a bit tough. I suppose 18mm is WAY too big, but I figured with it being leather it would work.   I have another, better looking 4220 on a leather dress strap, so I thought something entirely different, fun and causal would be fun for this one. I plan to wear it with jeans and short sleeve shirts this summer.   I was also thinking of an olive green nato, but ultimately decided I preferred the feel of leather. I have a summer watch on a perlon, and cloth straps aren't my usual cup of tea. One is enough."
Watches,3e00ud,sircarbonmojo,3,Mon Jul 20 23:41:24 2015 UTC,"For something thinner like nylon I agree on 18mm but for something thick like that leather strap I would have gone for a 16mm width.  Maybe even a one piece strap over a nato, those rings are also pretty large. Either way, it's a cool watch. I'm sure you'll get the strap figured out."
Watches,3e00ud,sternv3,4,Mon Jul 20 23:54:31 2015 UTC,I think an olive green NATO that fits the lugs better would look nice

Watches,3e00ud,FictionaI,4,Mon Jul 20 23:13:48 2015 UTC,"The strap is way overpowering. I would put it either on a very thin, unpadded, plain leather strap (not a nato or zulu) or a vintage bamboo bracelet in stainless."
Watches,3e00ud,FictionaI,4,Mon Jul 20 23:29:24 2015 UTC,"Since you're asking for opinions, the strap looks awful with the watch. Very pretty timepiece, but that is certainly not the band to go with it. Something more refined and smaller would suit that watch much better."
Watches,3e00ud,gleam,-6,Mon Jul 20 23:39:15 2015 UTC,"I guess I did ask for opinions, but I didn't expect it to be a full on pile-on. Figured at least -someone- would like it... Hell, I don't care what you all think, I'm wearing it now and am going to wear it this way for a while... Maybe I'm delusional, but I think it looks pretty good in person :)  I have the same reference # on a smaller, more ""suitable"" strap -- I just wanted to stick this one on something crazy and fun.

I was excited to put it on but I had to wait until my link remover kit came today. I took out two links already, if I took out three it would have been too tight. So I moved to the clasp with the small increments and I can't figure out how to put the tiny pin back through. The pin isn't shaped like the others, it is think in the middle and thinner on the ends. Could any of you guys guide me in the right direction in how to help me put it back? Thanks!"
Watches,3dz4mv,bjorn0062,2,Mon Jul 20 18:36:09 2015 UTC,"The pin that you can't get is the one in the picture on the table? That's a springbar, put it back in the endlink of the bracelet and then fit it from the inside. The tolerance is loose enough on Ray bracelets that you can put one end in and then compress the bar to slip the other in, you don't have to compress both side's at once."
Watches,3dz4mv,Bloom_brewer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:57:50 2015 UTC,This. But you also don't want to take out all the links from one side of the bracelet. The clasp won't sit correctly in the middle of the wrist. If you took out three links you want to do 2 from the six side and 1 from the 12.

Whether that means going for a slightly more expensive bottle of wine on a night out, or buying a slightly more expensive pair of shoes than you planned, or whether that means upgrading to the fasttrack tickets at a themepark to help you jump the queue.  The same goes with watches. If you can afford it, get the upgraded version. If you happen to love watches even more after buying either of these watches then you're not going to look back and think ""I wish I'd bought the quartz instead"".

Watches,3dv1sk,heisenberg0,8,Sun Jul 19 19:21:34 2015 UTC,"Got my Mako USA in last week and its been wonderful so far. I am not a fan of stainless steel bands and usually swap them out immediately in favor of cloth (I don't own any watches worth more that $250 so its not THAT bad). This time I wanted a sportier look, a watch for outdoor activities like riding my bike and going to the beach, so I decided to go with a rubber strap.   This is my first white-faced Orient and  I was very pleased with the dial in person.  The white has some texture to it, it looks really nice indoors and out.  The lume is also exceptionally bright, way brighter than my Ray Raven's.  All in all, I'm very happy with the changed Orient made to the Mako even though $225 + shipping is a pretty steep price increase.  It feels very solid and the sapphire crystal is really a must-have.  Great summer watch."
Watches,3dv1sk,MGNero3,4,Sun Jul 19 19:21:42 2015 UTC,I love this watch on this strap. I don't usually have a strong affinity for the Makos. How hard was it switching out the strap? Do I need any special tools besides the tool I normally use to switch out leather straps? Also do you have a link to the rubber strap?
Watches,3dv1sk,GhostalkerS,5,Sun Jul 19 19:29:30 2015 UTC,"Even better, you don't need to use a standard spring bar tool with the Mako USA. Unlike the standard Mako/Ray, it has drilled lugs. So you can use a small pin/paperclip/punch to remove the bracelet. Most spring bar tools have the correct size post on the opposite side to achieve this. Much easier than using the standard spring bar tool fork method."

Watches,3dz7e2,SirCharlesChurros,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"Judging by the long time to get to you, it was probably sent from India by some eBay person?  I had the similar experience. Often, these watches are actually assembled together by those sellers with the parts salvaged from several of the same model watches. This by itself doesn't bother me (definitely not with the cheap watch anyway). But in the process, they don't always take care to fit things in together properly.  So, I had opened the case and found that the plastic gasket (or whatever this thing is called) between the movement and the corpus has been cut incorrectly, and, as inserted, it touched the balance wheel, preventing it from moving freely.  So, I took this plastic out, and the watch started ticking. I then cut off a bit that touched the movement from that plastic, reinserted it, closed the case. And it had been working fine ever since.  Yours might have something similar."
Watches,3dz7e2,zhech,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:41:18 2015 UTC,"So I opened it up, and it's not the plastic ""gasket"" (frame?), but it seems to be the movement itself.

Watches,3dthox,makanimike,6,Mon Jul 20 05:17:18 2015 UTC,"I was looking around for a nice and affordable dive watch and I started looking around for Seikos! At first I discovered the Seiko 5 ""Sea Urchin"" which i saw on youtube and then that's where the research became a bit more thorough. When I first came across the SNZH57, I was in love!   With the vintage look with the gold detail and upon further research, I saw all the mods with the Fifty-five fathoms dial with the bradystraps sailcloth strap with the gold stitching to match and then started looking into deployment clasp to sweeten the final result. I bought this from Skywatches as it's the cheapest i've found with the cheapest express shipping options on top of the fact that there have been positive reviews from the site. All that's left for me to do is email the man himself, Yobokies about the FFF dial and possibly the sapphire dome.  Question! In regards to the sapphire dome, what is the main difference between that and the default dome that this seiko comes with? I'm still new to all of this and would love to learn more about it and hopefully someone can ELI5!"
Watches,3dthox,rockwellslaststand,7,Sun Jul 19 09:03:28 2015 UTC,"I'm 99% sure the Seiko originally does not come with a domed crystal. It is flat. The Sapphire Dome is....well...domed.

Watches,3ducjk,Scruffy_lookin,14,Sun Jul 19 15:41:52 2015 UTC,"People commonly made ordered custom jobs like this for existing watches.    Omega never made such a nugget watch as-is but that doesn't necessarily mean the watch portion is not authentic omega (though my guess is it isn't since a 70's era omega quartz would have a different marking other than ""quartz"").   However it doesn't really matter since 90% of the value of such a watch is almost purely in whether the gold is real or plated.  A quartz omega such as this in a standard case would only be worth about $100 on a good day...however the scrap gold value of a heavy gold case and bracelet is likely in the neighborhood of $700-$2000 depending on whether it's 10k/14k/or 18k.  All the value is in the gold and almost none in the watch.   Due to the extreme increase in the price of metal most watches like this are worth much more as scrap than as watches and end up in the melting pot as a result.  It takes 5 seconds to test the gold...take it to any jeweler and they can tell you with an acid test."
Watches,3ducjk,dav7e,16,Sun Jul 19 18:27:51 2015 UTC,"The fact that is quartz makes me think its fake. This design would obviously have to be custom, and anyone willing to have a true gold nugget watch made would at least go for mechanical or auto. Id say this is a costume piece."

I'm not saying it for price reasons, but style wise I think open hearts are much more flexible fashion wise and not quite so taste specific. You can get a Kenneth Cole skeleton auto for under $100 USD, but it isn't a quality watch."

Watches,3dypvx,throw-away25,2,Mon Jul 20 16:50:54 2015 UTC,"You could probably spend some quality time on eBay and get a De Ville and still have some money to put towards a service.  Maybe check out Christopher Ward but most of their lines have dates and I'm not sure which are automatic or not.   The Poljot and Harman will be more than 500, and I really doubt you'll be able to find an aesthetically similar automatic in that range.  A Seagull 1963 maybe?  They're hand winding though.  For comparison a modern watch that looks similar to the two chronographs you picked would be a Junghans Telemeter, and they're more like $2500 I think."

Watches,3dypvx,AceDetective427,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:10:23 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. Nothing under 38mm. I have pretty small wrists so up to 42 should be fine.
Watches,3dypvx,MGNero3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:11:43 2015 UTC,"I can't think of any autos offhand that don't have at least a date window besides skeletons. I would recommend a basic Hamilton in your price range (with 30% off list), like a Khaki Field, but all of them will have the date window. You may be better off just finding one with the most inconspicuous date window possible and just learn to ignore it, or possibly learn to like them. I have a lot of watches i constantly try and cycle though and my date numbers are wrong all of the time. When I catch them I fix them, and it takes me all of 2 seconds to advance it a day or two."

It's not that brands such a Rolex or Omega technically don't have a place on the list (because I certainly do like them), it's just I felt they weren't adding anything to the conversation.

Maybe a small addition, but add some cheaper budget divers (e.g. orient makos/seiko skx series)  because those can be had for around $200 or less, which might be a good entry point for someone who isnt quite up to spending $1k+ on a new watch just yet  and personally (im totally biased) but i think the seiko skx007 is a beautiful little thing. or the seiko monsters etc."

Watches,3dtm8g,SwingingToTheLeft,4,Sun Jul 19 14:22:29 2015 UTC,"At a quick glance, the Soprod A10 in the Steinhart is an uncommon movement. It's likely based on the Seiko 4L series, used in older (cheaper) Credor watches. It's similar in quality and performance to the ETA 2892, but not many companies use them.  The Tudor's ETA is a little bit interesting since it's modified. It's a top grade 2824 with a triovis fine adjustment regulation system (arguably not any better than the standard one but preferred by companies like IWC and Nomos) and a KIF shock protection system. It's not necessarily any better than another top grade 2824, just different."

Watches,3dxh6b,privatly,5,Mon Jul 20 10:02:20 2015 UTC,"Hey, I actually own the Rodina st17, the Braun BN0021BKBKG, and my dad owns a few Skagens.   Skagen is owned by Fossil, and their movements are fairly reliable. I have noticed that their cases are not particularily strong, at least in the models my dad has bought, and you have to remember that most quartz watches in this price range have the medium-to-small risk of eventually acting unpredictably.   Next, the Rodina. I find my self wearing this watch less and less over the months. I only wear it for it's clean aesthetic, but the watch is a tad too small for me, and the movement runs a little fast (+5 seconds/day). The built quality is nevertheless very high for a Chinese watch, and the fact that it comes with a sapphire crystal shouldn't be overlooked. The case feels solid and +5 seconds a day isn't too bad, but I never wear this watch to high pressure situations such as exams, work, or travel. I wear this watch for the look of it and how it feels, but it's wrist time has been taken over by other mechanical watches that I've bought over time.  Finally, the Braun watch is certainly one of my favourites. It does bug me that the ticks don't match the corresponding marker on the dial, but this sort of problem is common to many watches in this price range (Bulova, for instance). My Braun watch loses only a few seconds every couple of months and I find myself relying on this watch for exams, study, work, and travel. I know very little about the movement (I suspect it is a Japanese Miyota) but it has been good to me when I've needed it. The clean aesthetics of the dial are also incredibly legible, and it makes a huge difference to have the numbers written cleanly on the dial when you want to know the time quickly. The design, inspired by Dieter Rams, is timeless, and the case feels sturdy. The band is starting to wear out, but replacements shouldn't be hard to come by online. I might try other straps soon.  As for the battery, I can't be sure whether Amazon would include it. I don't see why not. I think the question should be whether the battery included is new or old. Sorry for the long message, but I hope it helped."

It didn't look bad, and it had a sort of utilitarian charm that I liked. But I wanted a more versatile band and this was it.  This SKX009 is my second watch, my first real one because the other was a Timex Weekender. A good watch that I still wear, but you know. Sometimes I regret getting the 009 and not the 007 because I feel like a plain black bezel would be sharper than the Pepsi bezel, other times I think the opposite.  Overall, great purchase and a beautiful watch. Thanks for looking!  (Oh yeah, if you'd like to suggest another watch for me to buy, budget being like 500$ or less, please do! Preferably not a dive watch, because I've already got one and I'd like to have a diverse group.

But because I'm getting more interested in watchmaking in general I am thinking about opening the case and fixing it myself, maybe modding the watch. but that's a whole other project. Currently I'm focusing on straps haha"

I'll probably buy this one with the bezel already installed. I just need to somehow justify buying a bezel that costs half as much as the whole watch.

Watches,3dvzb1,rabiiiii,3,Mon Jul 20 00:06:38 2015 UTC,"First, to start off, vintage ladies watches aren't all that valuable in comparison to mens. It's a simple supply and demand thing, there are tons of them and very few people wanting them. So it is easy to find a nice one for not a lot of money.  The first one looks to have a refinished dial to me. Not that that is particularly damning, but something to keep in mind. The second one looks better and is the one I would opt for given the circumstances.   Things you should consider before getting anything for your wife:   Is she going to tolerate a vintage hand wind mechanical? Accuracy may only be on the order of 30 seconds to a minute off a day. Expecting better is likely unrealistic. They will not be water resistant in almost all instances, so she needs to be very careful. You'll need to get it serviced before wear, most assuredly.  Factor in another $150-200 to start for that."
Watches,3dvzb1,ArkJasdain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:46:29 2015 UTC,Accuracy isn't the top priority. I just want to get her something with a bit of history she can wear to more formal occasions. This is absolutely not going to be a beater watch. She has a quartz Casio for that.  Thank you for the advice.
Watches,3dvzb1,SonofaBitchVanOwen,3,Mon Jul 20 01:58:00 2015 UTC,You may also consider getting her a vintage men's Seamaster. Most of them will be around 33 or 34 mm which is more of a women's size today and you can usually get a decent one for $200 or 300. It may be more to her liking if she wants something a little less girly. Here's some pictures of mine
Watches,3dvzb1,SonofaBitchVanOwen,2,Mon Jul 20 02:08:38 2015 UTC,"That is gorgeous and looks like something I'd get for myself.  I haven't ruled out men's watches, but she likes things that are very small. Like if I wasn't worried about it, this one would be a no-brainer. In fact, I'm still tempted by it. The wear isn't going to bother her, in fact, it will probably add to the charm."

Watches,3dtn28,robbiekhan,2,Mon Jul 20 00:26:12 2015 UTC,It's more comfortable this way as there's no pressure from the extra ring. The only downside is you lose the keeper aspect that ring serves but any decent NATO strap will be thick enough to not allow the watch to be so loose that it falls when the strap is held by the buckle.   I cut the keeper section off then singe the cut area with a blowtorch head on my gas powered soldering iron for a somewhat professional looking heat sealed result.

This is my highest end watch so far. In the future I think I'm going to go with an Omega Seamaster with the blue dial.   I'm still in the search for a steel bracelet for my Peking to Paris, so far I think there is a model made by FC that has a very similar case, if not identical, that might fit. Any idea where I can find replacement steel oem bracelets? Not that I dislike the leather one it comes with, but I know over time it's gonna get beat up.

Watches,3dsuei,Comcastblows,6,Sun Jul 19 03:08:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry I stink at taking pictures, but here are a few more: Patek and Here - notice the band issue; and here.  The band is an original PP, less than a year old. This is the second PP band I've had that started falling apart within months. Does anyone have a suggestion/solution for what I can put on the watch? I assume this is moisture damage from sweat and/or washing my hands.  I purchased the PP pre-owned, and had it overhauled last year.  It is my dream watch, and I am very happy to have it.  The t6c is waterproof, and I can use it with pods for running, cycling, and general working out.  It's a great all around watch, especially for travel."
Watches,3dsuei,ArkJasdain,15,Sun Jul 19 03:10:29 2015 UTC,"I can tell you whatever leather band you put on that Patek will continue to degrade and crack like that if you continue to wear them as tight as you are in the wrist picture. Yes I know saying it's tight sounds wrong and it's probably perfectly comfortable to you. Leather straps, of any type of leather, do not lend themselves to hot and moist environments like you get when they're held in direct contact with a somewhat sweaty wrist. If you loosen them up a notch or two so the watch can slide slightly freely over that wrist bone without any issue they last noticeably longer as that extra breathing room makes a big difference in letting them dry out more. Yes it means the watch will slide around some and rotate some on your wrist."
Watches,3dsuei,Not_an_oompa_loompa,2,Sun Jul 19 03:30:25 2015 UTC,I was under the impression horse hide (like the straps used on Nomos watches) doesn't do that?
Watches,3dsuei,ArkJasdain,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:48:32 2015 UTC,"It may hold up better for a while, but in the end it's still going to happen. The thing to check is if the strap is lined inside, what is that lining made of? Most straps use a soft calfskin or similar liner rather than the same material which is on the outside of the strap, and the liner is going to behave similarly regardless- you can imagine alligator or crocodile skin is naturally going to not degrade much in contact with water and yet they still do this on the inside."

I think you'd be hard pressed to list an advantage of the in-house models you're looking at. Overall design and quality of craftsmanship are more important imho.  Also, in-house movements, while may come with a longer warranty, will be more expensive to service in the long run.  Just something to think about."

Watches,3dr3f1,ArkJasdain,11,Sat Jul 18 17:20:08 2015 UTC,"Someone else recently posted a picture of a Seiko torn down with all the parts knolled out. I figured it's been a while since I've posted something interesting up, and I liked the idea. Unfortunately the lighting at work in combination with my phone camera makes for a picture that isn't nearly the quality of the Seiko picture, but it's still nice enough to give you an idea of the parts, I think.   What you see here is a Piaget 880P, disassembled and laid out before cleaning (so you can see traces of the old dirt and lubricants on some of the parts). The movement is an in-house automatic chronograph, with flyback and second time zone. It uses a column wheel in combination with a vertical clutch, so it performs well both chronograph on and off, there's typically little amplitude lost when the chronograph is engaged, it varies movement to movement but generally speaking I see from 5-20 degrees loss, which is pretty darn good. For those not familiar, the flyback complication means that the minute and seconds totalizers can be reset to zero at any time, even while the chronograph is running, and then they will immediately continue counting without you having to restart it. Most chronographs are unable to do this, in fact attempting to reset them while they're running will often result in damage requiring parts replacement, so don't try that on your chronograph unless you happen to have a flyback capable one.   The design also has two barrels, making for a power reserve in the order of 72 hours. The rotor on this version of the movement is PVD coated black for a contrast, there are also other watches which use a rhodium plated bridge to match the rest of the movement or a rose gold plated one. The automatic system is done very similarly to Seiko's ""magic lever"" system, and thus works very well and very efficiently, winding in either direction automatically or it can be hand wound. It uses a traditional screwed balance wheel, which is something not often seen in modern watches, most use either a smooth  glucydur alloy without any protrusions or some of the higher end pieces are beginning to more commonly come with balances equipped with inertia blocks or adjustable screws (Patek and Rolex respectively have been using them for a while, but there are many others now). Timekeeping is generally pretty good, although these movements are not chronometer certified, I've usually been able to get them regulated down to having a total delta under 8 seconds with timekeeping somewhere in the -2 to +10 seconds per day range in 6 different positions. I personally don't like to send out a watch which runs with a losing rate in any position, but sometimes it simply isn't economical time wise to do such fine adjustment and poising work on the balance, especially consider the lack of certification. For what it's worth, factory service specification allows for timing between -5 and +15 seconds per day on this movement.   This particular watch is done in a titanium case with rubber strap, which was a first for Piaget, and only the second exception to their rule of otherwise working exclusively in precious metals for their watches. Front and back crystals are sapphire (incidentally, the front crystal as a shape very close to a hyperbolic paraboloid- think Pringles) as it fits into the curved front of the case, 100M water resistance with a screw down crown, double deployant buckle with two quick size adjustments.  I do have a few criticisms of the movement, although they're fairly minor. As you can see, the mainplate is well finished with the perlage, but the secondary bridges for the train wheels and barrels are not, they're left with a plain matte finish. I guess this is OK as you cannot see those surfaces when the movement is assembled, but I feel like it wouldn't have added a lot of cost to do some perlage on those bridges as well. The top plates which you can see when the movement is assembled are done with the circular Cotes de Geneve, and all bridges are secured with traditional heat blued screws (which look nearly black in my picture, sorry, but in person they are a brilliant bright blue). Additionally, the button pressed to use the flyback or reset the chronograph when stopped is very stiff in comparison to the start and pause button. This is mostly just due to the construction of the movement, but inevitably it does feel a bit concerning in comparison. We've been able to alleviate this to some extent with lubricating the components in a certain few spots, but results vary depending on which watchmaker has serviced the movement.   For the sake of explanation, the parts as you see them laid out here is not something I would normally do at all. My normal course of operation has me dismantling the movement and putting parts directly into cleaning baskets (and doing some precleaning as necessary). I only separate the parts into two large single baskets for the dial side and bridge side, and a smaller basket for each of the automatic train and fragile components like the pallet, escape wheels, shock jewels, etc. After cleaning they get dumped into a small parts tray with dust cover (something like this) and I assemble and lubricate from there. I don't find it worth my time to go laying out parts in any specific order like some watchmakers do. I have a good memory for construction of movements and typically only need to reference a technical guide the first couple times I work on a movement before I've got it down."
Watches,3dr3f1,skyeriding,2,Sat Jul 18 17:20:19 2015 UTC,"When you handle movement parts like that, are the tweezers you use standard metal ones? Or are they some form of e.g. plastic, to prevent any damage or scratches to the finished parts? I'm interested as to just how delicate the finished surfaces (pearlage, mirror polished, striped) hold up over being handled"
Watches,3dr3f1,skyeriding,3,Sun Jul 19 02:46:30 2015 UTC,"I use #5 Dumostar tweezers for handing finer parts, and for larger or more well finished parts I use standard brass tweezers. With the right technique and a light touch the steel tweezers don't leave marks, but it's not hard to scratch if you're not careful. The brass ones generally don't mark at all, but do require fairly frequent maintenance to resharpen and dress the inside surfaces of the tips to keep them gripping well, and handling the parts and using them deforms the tips because brass is soft.  The mirror finished parts are fairly susceptible to scratching, as any little mark shows up, so brass or another soft metal is preferred. Most of the parts and bridges are much sturdier with regards to handling though.   We do have a few movements (this for example) which are fully PVD coated, made of gold, or otherwise not standard finished though. For those I take extra caution and only use brass or nickel tweezers, as neither will scratch the finish."
Watches,3dr3f1,skyeriding,2,Sun Jul 19 03:04:51 2015 UTC,"Alright thanks for the reply.   Typically for watches within this price range, what materials are the movement plates/bridges made of? Rhodium-plated steel? I never really understood the plating process. Is the Rh applied after finishing (e.g. pearlage, cotes de geneve, anglage...), or is finishing done on the Rh plating itself?"
Watches,3dr3f1,raptor217,3,Sun Jul 19 05:19:14 2015 UTC,"Typical plate material is a high grade brass. It machines very well and is very stable. Finishing and decorative stuff is done directly to the brass, and then the components rhodium plated. Since the rhodium is extremely thin, it doesn't really change the appearance of the finishing other than the color. Vintage Omega movements are notably finished in a rose gilt color rather than rhodium, but the same idea applies. I'd have to pull out my texts on plating as I don't recall them off hand, but I believe you need an intermediary layer or two between the brass and rhodium, I think nickel will go directly onto brass and then rhodium will go directly onto the nickel.   Some real high end stuff with use gold to make the plates from, though this is atypical. Incidentally, there are versions of the Altiplano Skeleton which use gold bridges set with diamonds."

Watches,3dt4ug,wkfink,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:00:20 2015 UTC,"As the title says, I tried on this JLC today in the mall. I was awed by some of the intricate movements in a video posted here a couple days ago featuring JLCs, so I sought out the name as soon as I got to my local Torneau store. I especially liked this piece because of the beautiful moon phase indicator. Hopefully someday I'll be able to own a watch as beautiful as this. The representative mentioned that it had an alarm feature as well. I've been looking for videos of the alarm, but can't find any :c I was a little annoyed that they wouldn't take the plastic off or play the alarm for me, but I can't really blame them. I was definitely not going to drop 18.5k right then and there to buy it."

So much great design and not to mention the fabulous movements that almost every one of the most respected watch companies have used at one point or another...  To have a watch with perpetual calendar, alarm, and moonphase is a fantastic set of complications.

Watches,3dto3e,Citizen_V,3,Sun Jul 19 12:42:03 2015 UTC,"That is not quite what they said.  In the GS manuals, they say:   SEIKO makes it a policy to typically keep a stock of replacement parts for  this watch for 10 years.   This is after production ceases. Similar parts may be available as well since many Seiko models and movements are fairly similar.   Additionally, Seiko was asked about this service policy in a recent interview:   Seiko: On the wall outside the Micro-Artist Studio in the Seiko facility in Shiojiri is a framed statement of the Studio’s philosophy. It contains the phrases: “Reliable to wear until grandchildren” and “long term satisfaction”. These ideas apply to Grand Seiko, just as they do to the Credor and other watches that the Shiojiri facility manufactures. For all Grand Seiko watches, we retain inventories for projected use decades ahead, so the serviceability period can be as long as possible. This applies to all Grand Seiko movement types, including Spring Drive."

I completely agree that it's pretty shocking that they only expect people to want to service their $3,000 - $5,000+ watch for only 10 years after production stops.

Hell I even had a few sweet calculator watches. I was pretty proud kid walking out of Zellers with a kickass high-tech watch.  Since then I moved up to swatches, decent automatics and some entry level luxury watches. My collection is far from complete.   Last week a G-Shock caught my eye and I came to the realization that every collection needs to have at least one digital. I then did what any /r/watches geek would do - I bough that sucker ASAP.  I'm really digging it. The interface is relatively simple after a quick glance at the teeny-tiny 90 page manual.   As you can see I decided to go with a pretty classic looking square face G-Shock. This GWM5610 is a Tough Solar with 20 bar depth rating, perpetual calendar good until 2099, world time with 48 cities plus UTC, and atomic time keeping with DST. It's been able to sync with the tower every day.   It's probably not going to live on my wrist but it's super comfy and light. Totally feels right paired up with a cool t-shirt and some sneakers.    *Added an Amazon link."
Watches,3dr496,highandtightgshock,3,Sat Jul 18 17:28:39 2015 UTC,Casio has manuals available in a PDF online if you ever lose the tiny manual or want an easier format to read. You can type in the module number on the case back (usually a four digit number in a box) into google with the word Casio or Gshock and it will be easy to find from there.

I'm an IT entrepreneur, and I try to buy a watch whenever I achieve a business goal.   I bought the Breitling when I sold my first company in 2007. I bought the Breitling at Nice airport, traveling to celebrate the sale.  After I sold my company, the media giant that bought the company completely tanked it. I mean - literally ruined it, structurally and financially. In late 2012, they therefore proposed I should buy it back from them. I accepted, renamed the company ""Omega Media"" - and bought the Omega Speedmaster Professional in Rome to celebrate.   After having spent a lot of time since 2012 rebuilding the company, it's now back to its former glory and business is going well. I therefore decided to splurge a third time, buying the titanium IWC 3511 from a cash-strapped friend for $2100.  I'm super happy with all my watches and can highly recommend all of them to other collectors. My next purchase is going to be a laid back Rolex, such as a black Explorer, Submariner or Datejust."

And I rarely do here except for the occasional one word replies or trolling/flaming.   People don't like negative comments in this sub, and I understand why. If you don't like something, expressing what it is you don't like about it, pointing out what you do like about it, and offering an example of what you are talking about is best.

Watches,3drmvk,YoureTerrific,5,Sat Jul 18 20:07:34 2015 UTC,A little over a month ago the Wall Street Journal ran this article with this video about Indian watch manufacturer HMT. I was inspired by the history and the people. So I hopped on eBay and bought the above $16 charmer. It features Hindi/Devanagari (?) numerals and text and came with both a black and and a powder blue strap. And so far it's keeping accurate time.   It feels good to have a piece of modern Indian history (if this watch even is authentic) and reminds me of my many trips to that most amazing country.

I removed the link because user gleam said it was against the spamming rules.  Although he may just have a vendetta against me for trying to discuss building watches.  A lot of parts for watches can be found on Ofrei.  For example I have ordered a case for the 7750 rated for $300m.  Ofrei is an expert shop when it comes to watch parts and also listed that this case is used in watches ranging from $1600 to $2200, however gleam has argued with me adamantly trying to say that it's equivalent to a Invicta.  He has been trying to belittle everything about building your own watch as opposed to buying a Swiss brand.  I have a feeling that a lot of people won't like this idea because they paid $10,000 for their watches with a 7750 movement,and now since I'm introducing the idea of building watches, everyone can have 7750 ETA based watches with their choice of styling (not an Invicta) without paying $10,000 for one, making the people who have bought Swiss brands feel less special.

I was merely trying to illustrate that the movement is used in more expensive watches.  I agree that the most expensive watches that use the 7750 have heavily modified movements.  I will also agree that a self built $7750 watch for $610 may be equivalent in quality to an Invcita (I assume you only compared to Invicta due to price) but there is no way to know without actually measuring somehow.  It's more accurate to say that Invicta uses the same grade of movement (which is most likely true, but there is still no way of knowing without opening one to inspect), of which there are only 2 that ETA sells that I know of (elborated and top).  Out of curiosity, how much does a top grade 7750 cost to buy and where can you get them?  This would be useful information for those who want to use a top grade movement in a self build."
Watches,3drmse,vakerr,2,Sun Jul 19 13:19:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you think that a stock 7750 movement is what you get in $10,000 watches. It's a ubiquitous movement found in many sub-$1,000 ones (Tissot, Hamilton).   At $10k you're getting into in-house movements, certainly not stock 7750s.  Fair play to anyone who wants to build a watch from parts off Ofrei or similar - we've had several posts here of people who've done just that, it's not a new idea - but to imply that you can create something akin to a $10k watch by doing so is unrealistic."
Watches,3drmse,brainsandstuff,0,Sun Jul 19 09:10:23 2015 UTC,"Yup, I am well aware that more expensive 7750 based watches make modifications to the movement.  Sorry, I didn't mean that you can build a $10,000 watch, only that the movement is used in more expensive watches.  Merely trying to illustrate that this is a great movement used in a lot of other more expensive watches.  I've seen 7750 based watches fetch between $1700 and $6600 here preowned.  The higher end of these watches probably heavily modify the stock 7750 but they are still 7750s and retain the design."
Watches,3drmse,vakerr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:02:32 2015 UTC,You can find (one off) eta 7750 cases on eBay all day errday for $50-200. Usually including dial etc.
Watches,3drmse,RedLanceVeritas,2,Sun Jul 19 10:25:03 2015 UTC,I wonder about the case. Do you have any recommendation on good quality cases available as parts?
Watches,3drmse,brainsandstuff,2,Sun Jul 19 00:12:47 2015 UTC,"Otto Frei sells a couple, but they are pretty bland. Seiko 5's come in a few different cases, and hands and dials for those are widely available, allowing you to essentially buy case and movement in one guaranteed-to-fit package. The latter is what I have done mostly so far."
Watches,3drmse,brainsandstuff,3,Sun Jul 19 00:34:45 2015 UTC,"Tiger Concept's hand's and dials will fit the ETA 2824-2 or 2836-2.  Might be worth to contact them to see if their cases fit ETA movements as well.  They have the same diameter (11 1/2 ligne) as the movement options available for their watches.  This German watch part ebay store also sells a wide variety of cases.  What I want to do is compile a list of good parts suppliers, ultimately making a guide on building watches of which I will post to this sub and elsewhere."
Watches,3drmse,kabaclyde,2,Sun Jul 19 01:57:40 2015 UTC,"Yes of course see Ofrei for an example of a 7750 case I ordered.  They have cases for other movements like the 2824-2 and the 2892A2 as well.  However for the 2824-2 there are no significantly waterproof cases available.  For those a good resource would be ebay where the cases can range from $100 for thousands depending on how much you are willing to spend.  Check out Tiger Concept as well.  They sell watch kits (all the parts except the movement) which will fit a 11 1/5 ligne movement which is a standard size and might fit ETA movements, you should probably contact Tiger themselves to see if this is true though."

This was worn so long and continuous the band is worn from sitting at a desk  Movado 'Defio' style watch. This has a blue face even though it looks black here  Movado White face watch. I bought this because it was different than most Movado watches and has the date which I don't see often in the classic Movado format.  Rolex Submariner. My prized possession. This one I bought used a couple months ago. I actually sold another newer ESQ and another Seiko to ""justify"" the purchase even though the value was not even close.

The backing is a very nice matte finish and the lume is fantastic at night.   So far this is keeping about +7 seconds a day so I am very happy with the time.   I swapped the strap for a NATO for looks but the original bracelet is amazing and very high quality, but heavy.   This is a beefy solid watch and definitely earns the 300m rating.

Watches,3dswqa,jaetran,4,Sun Jul 19 09:53:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely. To me the Bambino is a dress watch. Although it has a more of a modern case diameter of ~40mm, it has all the elements of a dress watch. The dial isn't clustered with a bunch of subdials, numbers, windows, etc. It just simply has a date window and hour markers. The domed crystal is there to give it more of a vintage look and feel to the watch. It just boils down to how big your wrists are. To me, the 40mm case is a little big because I got some small wrists so I prefer something that's around 38mm.  Edit: correcting a word"
Watches,3dswqa,wkfink,3,Sun Jul 19 04:08:40 2015 UTC,"40mm isn't traditional. 40mm is modern, and gigantic for a dress watch.  That said, I wear a 39mm Railmaster as a dress watch.

Watches,3dswqa,sl0th1009,4,Sun Jul 19 10:09:21 2015 UTC,"Yes it's 100% a dress watch. It doesn't necessarily hit all the boxes as far as classic dress watches are concerned, but it hits (arguably) the most important ones. You also have to consider that size is relative: these days watches run rather large, so while the bambino isn't ~35mm like classic dress watches, it's certainly smaller than a lot of casual watches today. The only classically informal things about it are a small date complication (which is rather useful and small), the domed sapphire crystal (which many people, including myself, think gives it a classic/vintage look and feel), and the thickness/size, it's overall a very simply watch. Personally, I think it will work great as a dress watch. Alternatively, in case the domed crystal is too much for you, the Symphony from Orient has a flat crystal, and an overall more modern look."
Watches,3dswqa,Mgotham,3,Sun Jul 19 05:44:57 2015 UTC,Yes.   How big is your wrist? Because 40mm is small to me.

Watches,3dswqa,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:54:07 2015 UTC,"That's about the same as me. I actually think anything smaller than 40 looks too small on my wrist, even a dress watch. I look more to proportional size and not actual measurement. If a watch is too small on someone's wrist I tend to think they just got what they were supposed to and didn't put any thought into how it actually looked.   These days anything seems to be a dress watch without regard to diameter. Hell, the President wears a 41 mm watch. As long as it doesn't have bright colors and a huge bezel.   Is automatic a requirement? Because the Orient Class answers a lot of your concerns - but it is quartz (which I prefer on a dress watch which I might not wear for a few days at a time)."

It's a pretty easy and fun project for anybody interested!  Paracord is relatively inexpensive and you can use just about anything for the hardware; I used hardware from an old Survival Strap I had in this case.  There are plenty of tutorials out there on YouTube for tying survival bracelets, all you have to do is cut away or remove the watch from the original strap and weave the cord through the pins on either side and behind the face halfway through tying. The trickiest part is determine the right length of cordage for making an even number of knots on either side of the watch face as well as sizing correctly -- that's why adjusted hardware like the one shown here is nice, but I have done it with plastic buckles or shackles in the past.  Let me know what you guys think and if you have any suggestions for watches that a paracord strap would look cool with! Happy to field questions about making these as well."

Watches,3dqkyh,GameOfBoogaloo,9,Sat Jul 18 16:38:18 2015 UTC,"The brands operate their own business plans independently, they aren't really directed by Richemont at all. What Richemont does is allow for the shared networking and resources among the companies. I'm with Piaget, so I have a fair bit of experience with ultra thin watches.  What I find interesting is their choice of construction. This has got to have incredibly thin crystals. This watch is going to be very easily bent, and will be something that should only be worn for dress occasions and occasionally, it won't hold up to daily wear. They're going to have a lot of these come back back for service because of an impact or flexing stopping the watch once people start wearing it. This one will be a servicing nightmare, and they won't be able to polish it more than probably 2 or 3 times at most during the life of the watch.  Also, interesting to note this is a limited edition, they're making 100 of each of the 4 variants. The Piaget Altiplano 900P is unlimited in production. Frankly, having handed that 900P, I wouldn't be surprised to see them make a few modifications and thin it down again and beat JLC by another .05 just because."

I'm sure Piaget is a relatively small company so I wouldn't be surprised if you were but I find it hard to believe that a company like Piaget or JLC can invest large sums of money into new products without getting a sign off and direction from Richemond. There is independence and than there is an independently operated wholly owned subsidiary. Regardless, it probably is better for morale of the general workforce if they act like they are operating ""100% independently"" as their own entity within the conglomerate, even if behind closed doors the reality is not quite as idealistic."

We do have meetings and updates on the company as a whole and corporate structure and operation however, and we are presented with information (some of which I can't disclose) about how things are done and the structure of the company. There isn't a single board or order that comes down from the top specifying how each brand will operate. Each brand operates on its own, the Richemont name and company comes in to provide support and back end logistics to keep them going without them having to worry about every little detail. There's a reason each brand is its own brand, and not JLC by Richemont or whatever else. Go look on any of the brands websites and you'll see no mention of Richemont at all on the hompages, then start digging to see how far in before you find that."
Watches,3dqkyh,ArkJasdain,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:49:37 2015 UTC,"There's a reason each brand is its own brand, and not JLC by Richemont or whatever else.   I would say a big part of that reason is that Richemont doesn't want to devalue all their brands by adding ""by Richemont"" to all of them. By keeping themselves hidden from the consumer side they are strengthening the position of each individual brand so they do not obviously appear as part of a large conglomerate. Branding such as ""VC by Richemont"" would just be ridiculous.   There isn't a single board or order that comes down from the top specifying how each brand will operate.   I don't think it would necessarily operate like that, but again I don't think companies like Piaget and JLC can just willy nilly start expensive initiatives that don't have Richemont approval. So yes, while a project such as this might originate from JLC, the sign off comes from Richemont, so in that sense it is simply a difference of perspective but the end result is not necessarily very different."

I think what I'm actually arguing for isn't really as extreme as you are thinking. I don't deny each entity is run independantly, only that Richemont is certainly more involved and hands on than saying ""OK you guys can build and develop whatever you want with whatever budget"".  Again, giving the impression that each is running as a completely independent unit is simply part of the marketing and branding message that Richemont wants to perpetuate with customers to strength the identity of each brand. As a marketing message, it's great. In reality, I don't believe it is so black and white."

There are hundreds of combos but my favorite is the Seiko SNKL23. Otherwise like the Casio the most"
Watches,3dsdy2,brwaldm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:19:39 2015 UTC,"I'd take the Casio over the other two, and a Citizen or Seiko over a Casio (although Casio is probably the best choice at the price point)..  Seiko 5 line is mechanical (no battery at all) and Citizen's ""EcoDrive"" line should be especially interesting to you, they've designed the solar panels so that they can generate energy even from indoor lighting. You'll wear out or break either of those many years from now without ever doing a battery change. Entry level watches in those lines might be more expensive (but not much) than the ones you listed, though.  Seiko (and many others) also make analog solar watches but if you're going down that road Citizen EcoDrive is the one to have IMO."

Watches,3dqsgl,Lanelord,2,Sat Jul 18 15:39:17 2015 UTC,"Hi guys,  This watch was a gift from an old job and doesn't get much use.    I don't know a great deal about watches, and as I'm trying to sell it, I was wondering if anyone could easily identify whether or not this is authentic?  It is a Ball watch and the model number is a DM1036A.  The weight feels good and to my untrained eye it appears to be a fine watch.  The only issue I have is that I keep having to wind it - I put this down to the two years of non-usage and assume that a service would rectify this problem?  Any light anyone can share would be gratefully appreciated.  Thanks"
Watches,3dqsgl,Citizen_V,5,Sat Jul 18 16:01:28 2015 UTC,"I was wondering if anyone could easily identify whether or not this is authentic?   While fake Ball watches do exist, last I saw, none used real tritium tubes. Just empty glass tubes. If the tubes on your watch glow, then I'm fairly certain it's real, especially since it's an older watch.   The only issue I have is that I keep having to wind it - I put this down to the two years of non-usage and assume that a service would rectify this problem?   A service would certainly work. I would suggest fully winding it (40-50 manual winds) and testing the power reserve first though. Perhaps you're just not moving enough during the day to keep it wound.  If you're trying to sell it, I recommend using watchrecon and chrono24 and looking at used versions of your watch to determine a good selling price. Make sure you're comparing to ones with a rubber strap, since watches with the OEM bracelets tend to sell more than ones with OEM straps."

Watches,3dtduq,lowspeedlowdrag,5,Sun Jul 19 07:21:57 2015 UTC,"Not at 10s/d it won't be. it'd be far worse than that (minutes out, not seconds).  10 seconds a day is still well within the norms for such watches. So I'd say there isn't actually anything wrong with it. Watches gain / lose time over days at different rates really. If it drastically changes then it might need looking at, but I wouldn't bother doing anything with the SKX007 being out by just 10s/d. It's not worth the cost to get it done considering Seiko would consider it well within spec (the 7s26 movement within this watch is rated as being -20/+40, if memory serves)."
Watches,3dtduq,ArghZombies,2,Sun Jul 19 11:13:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're actually completely correct. When I replied below, I had only glossed over the question but 10s per day is actually well within the specs, and even much more expensive watches can have the same performance."
Watches,3dtduq,___WE-ARE-GROOT___,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:47:44 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it might have been magnetised somehow; they can gain up to 5 seconds per hour when magnetised.

Watches,3dtduq,SpinDoctor777,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:19:52 2015 UTC,"many watch movements, particularly entry level seikos are sensitive to positional variance.    little things that you might not even notice such as different amount of time off or on the wrist, different use like longer at a desk or out exercising, changes in the state of wind, ... can all slightly drive the accuracy one direction or another."
Watches,3drwi9,LapsusAequitas,5,Sat Jul 18 21:33:58 2015 UTC,"For a college student period, a Sinn is a fantastic watch. You definitely don't have to baby a Sinn, I don't own one, but I've heard they're very robust. I wouldn't exactly chuck it at the wall during Finals Weeks, but you don't need to worry about bumping it into doorways and tables. Hamiltons are mass produced, there might be another reason why it's so cheap, but that's one of the big ones. They are slightly lower quality than watches at Sinn's price range, but it's not a huge difference. A Sinn could definitely be given to your son, as can a Hamilton (according to Christopher Nolan's Interstellar :c), but you are going to need to care for them. You can't just stick them in a drawer for 30 years, take them out and expect them to still be ticking"
Watches,3drwi9,TheMightyWill,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:56:35 2015 UTC,I'm definitely leaning towards the Sinn. If cost and availability weren't factors then the Sinn would win hands down. Thanks for the input!
Watches,3drwi9,scrotoplasm,4,Sat Jul 18 23:39:37 2015 UTC,The sinn is such a pretty watch that if you got the Hamilton I feel like you would be a little let down by not only the quality but also the dial
Watches,3drwi9,AceDetective427,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:03:46 2015 UTC,"If you are talking about the Hamilton being more cluttered, I agree. The Sinn looks cleaner but I don't think the Hamilton is an eye sore either. I am getting the feeling though that if I get the Hamilton it'll fell like I'm just settling for that one."
Watches,3drwi9,SteampunkSloth,4,Sun Jul 19 01:04:23 2015 UTC,I own the Hamilton and am very happy with the purchase. I don't really baby any of my watches and I frequently wear the Hamilton at work in IT and it takes its beating just as well as my Citizens and Seikos. That being said the 556A is nice looking as well and definitely cleaner style wise.   My advice? Buy what you really like since both are solid options.
Watches,3drwi9,brwaldm,4,Sun Jul 19 06:54:11 2015 UTC,"I own and regularly wear both a Hamilton Khaki King, and a Sinn 556i. As I'm a sucker for simplicity, the Sinn definitely commands most of my wrist time, but both are great watches.   That being said, and although I truly do love both, I do think that there is a notable difference between the two past just appearances. The Sinn is simply a better-finished watch; the movement gives a lot more to be looked at, and the satin finishing on the case really compliments the design well. Also - at least for the 556i - the lacquered black dial is more than meets the eye at first, and you definitely notice a difference from bright to dim lighting.   At the end of the day, I would buy both again without hesitation, but I personally do believe the Sinn is worth the extra cost. Its ridiculous legibility and 200m water resistance are also perhaps something to consider.   As a final note, although I wouldn't be playing lacrosse with it, you don't need to baby the Sinn - I've taken mine on a number of hiking trips with no troubles.   Edit: I should add that I find the Sinn more versatile in design as well. It fits better as a dress watch when needed, compared to my Hamilton."
Watches,3drwi9,brwaldm,3,Sun Jul 19 17:11:06 2015 UTC,"I have owned both, and to me there isn't much difference in quality to justify the price difference. The thing about the 556 is that it doesn't have much of the tech Sinn is known for (hardened case, gas filled, etc) and, on a bracelet is probably going to cost $800 more give or take. Plus the double AR coating on the 556 made me mad because it showed ""scratches"" in the coating very easily.  TL;DR Go with the Hamilton unless you really want a bracelet. Just my 2 cents.  Edit: Forgot to mention another option, the Archimede Outdoor Protect. Hardened case made my a well regarded German case manufacturer, same movement as the other two, ""pilot style"", and should be around 700ish dollars with a matched hardened bracelet. I think you can buy directly from their website for a good price. Good luck with your decisiob"
Watches,3drwi9,bungsana,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:37:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion! That looks like a stunning watch and definitely a lot less busy compared to the Hamilton. Do you think the Archimede is a better choice than the Hamilton and Sinn? You tossed its name into the hat and just left me wondering. Have you handled the Archimede?  I will probably end up with whichever one I chose on a leather or nato strap. For comfort reasons over cosmetic ones.
Watches,3drwi9,SonofaBitchVanOwen,2,Sun Jul 19 20:28:10 2015 UTC,"I've handled it but didn't own it like I did the Sinn and Hamilton so I just have a short-term impression, which was very positive. You could look over some threads on some forums but most opinions are pretty positive. For some German goodness, I would go for the Archimede Protect on a bracelet and get a dimodell black pilot strap (chronissimo) out of the choices you picked. My next choice would be the Khaki as you can get away with a brown strap which in my opinion can be worn with more. Everyone is different and how I feel now is very different to when I started collecting, as you really don't know what you like until you live with it for awhile.   Edit: fixed tense and point of view for grammatical sake  Edit 2: Forgot to mention that one of my favorite sites, wornandwound.com, has a side by side (by side) comparison of a 556, Archimede, and maybe one more to consider a Damasko DA36 which is the most expensive of the three but also highly regarded. Can't link it from my phone but it has some good side by side pictures for comparison"

It's a cal 411 (with centerseconds) from 1936 or 1937. The case is in extremely good condition (thank god) and completely clean (nothing engraved). The dial sadly/luckily is a redial from a few decades ago, but I'll source a NOS dial or get this one professionally redone. Then the watch will look as good as it was new back in the day! The blued hands are just amazing.   I've just taken a side-by-side picture with her solid gold baby sis (which is one of the very first Reverso's from 1931) https://instagram.com/p/5SBdItk5Yz"

I have been lurking on this sub looking for an affordable, nicer watch for a while now. I have shown her several watches from this sub that I liked, and I was surprised when she came back from her trip with this for me. I really like it, and just wanted to share the first watch for my collection.  If anyone has any recommendations for women's watches I am definitely interested! Where I live it is ""normal"" for couples to wear the same clothes: shirts, shoes, pants, watches, socks, etc. If anyone knows of a women's watch that would match mine I would really appreciate it.

It's officially 10mm thick, but wears like it's 7mm thick due to gradual doming.   500 words... Okay, shot with an Olympus OMD-EM5 and the gorgeous 75mm f/1.8 which shoots like a 150mm due to 2x crop factor of m43. It's taken some getting used to how long it is, especially for a prime, but the photos that come out are my best shots. One of m43's drawbacks is lack of depth of field, but at this length, there's plenty too much depth of field, but at this length, it tightens up to allow subject separation from background (thanks for clarification redditor who deleted comment?). I put $30 macro extension tubes on to allow me to focus this close. Works well for just muckin' around."

I ventured around a fossil store and held more than 10 of their watches with the metal band I am referring too. Not a single one felt heavy or like it was completely solid. Is this standard for all watch bands or would I expect a rolex metal band to be 100% completely solid and heavy?

Between them was this watch, I loved it right away because it is solar powered, has all the features that G-Shocks tend to have, and also, was in my price range so, this was a straight fit for my needs.  I just got it and so far am loving it! It's beautiful, has a really appealing display and looks pretty good on my wrist (in my opinion). The only issue I see that could affect this watch is that the LED on it isn't really good, so reading the time on a dark environment would be close to impossible, but I don't mind.

Watches,3dr8jy,sdraz,2,Sat Jul 18 18:05:54 2015 UTC,"The temp must be measured with the watch off your wrist for about 20 min. As far as altitude, since it is based off the barometer reading it will change with changing pressure. This can throw it off by a couple hundred feet in a day depending on the weather conditions. The best way to calibrate the altitude is to set it to a known reference at the beginning of wherever you want to track altitude. Trailheads and topo maps are my goto references, but gps altitude is usually pretty good for a ballpark. On longer trips you may need to adjust it due to changing barometric pressure. Over long distances such as in a car it will likely be off due to pressure changes over distance. Also good to note that it won't be accurate in commercial aircraft for altitude due to the pressurized cabin. They usually top out around 7000ft. of 'altitude'. Finally, the barometer won't line up with the numbers you find on weather reports due to the fact that those measurements are relative pressure readings which are converted to sea level pressure. Your watch is reading absolute pressure. You could convert it if you know the temp and altitude of your current position. I have a PRG-270 which is the same module minus the atomic time setting and I find its pretty accurate as long as you keep the above in mind. It worked really well on my trip to Colorado last month."

Watches,3dr5tk,MGNero3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:09:13 2015 UTC,I think under $150. I can stretch it a bit if need be and I definitely don't mind saving.  I was looking at the Casio Edifice series. They have features I like (like a chronograph and tachymeter) but the faces are fairly busy on a lot of them. I'm not sure I like them or not but I know I'd love a similar watch with a simpler face.

The Orient Producer is a great watch and so is the seiko solar. The producer is an automatic watch so if you don't wear it every couple of days you have to reset the time I don't know if that's an issue. The Orient Bambino allows you a lot of versatility. It can be worn with jeans/t shirt or with a suit and tie.   As for your outdoorsy watch options, I have  the same seiko 5 it's a phenomenal watch that takes a hell of a beating. The Seiko Rubber Analog is also a nice watch. While I don't have it I think it would be able to take a good beating."

The beat error is great, rate is great across different positions.  Not much rate deviation across the different positions and it also has a very stable rate.  I've never regulated this watch so this is the way it was regulated from factory.  The watch itself was $100 so I would consider this watch of excellent value.  Some extra notes about the movement:  -It's extremely loud, the loudest movement I've ever heard from any watch.  -The movement is huge and could very well be used as a pocket watch movement.  -Automatic winder only winds one way, unlike Seiko automatics which wind both ways.  -Automatic winder is pretty efficient and will get up to full wind in less than half a day of wearing it.  -Power reserve meter is accurate and also does take around 40 hours to wind down from full wind.  -The shock protection spring on the balance wheel looks to be an Incabloc (not sure if it's actually made by Incabloc or a Chinese clone) commonly found on Swiss movements.  -The balance bridge is reminescent of the balance bridge on the Rolex movments movement.  They seem to have borrowed a lot of elements from Swiss movements."

Stick the plier noses into two holes (over the plastic) that are wide apart and rotate counter clockwise.  It's easier with a 6 hole case since the pliers can center the torque on the case center but with a 5 hole case back it will be trickier.

Combine that with the wrong font on the bottom of the dial, the mismatched bezel font and hands, the flat white dial, the poorly engrave caseback, the extreme thickness of the watch, the mismatched bracelet (there is a speedy style bracelet but it is marked Seamaster not Speedmaster as the springbar holes are different), and several other little things scream fake, and not really a good one."
Watches,3do64o,toadbit,2,Sat Jul 18 04:00:24 2015 UTC,I always figured it was because to drill the hole for the crown you would just flip the case over and use the same drill for where a chronograph button would go. But who knows.

Watches,3dpyzj,ArghZombies,6,Sat Jul 18 14:37:34 2015 UTC,Sapphire or acrylic. Sapphire is strong and scratch-resistant. Acrylic is easy to remove scratches with a little polish. Mineral crystal is a terrible medium.
Watches,3dpyzj,jtth,2,Sat Jul 18 12:17:18 2015 UTC,"I love double domed Sapphire that is flush with the bezel. Double domed makes for less optical distortion (make sure to use AR on both sides). The only watch I prefer something else on is the Speedmaster Pro. The acrylic plays with light in an awesome way. But if the crystal is flush, Sapphire is way better IMO."
Watches,3dpyzj,SpaceTimePiece,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:51:08 2015 UTC,I like your thoughts as this is what I would choose for my next dive watch but the AR both site is scary as AR on top is scratch able. Who noted this.  Any advise on AR issues
Watches,3dpyzj,TheCompanionCrate,2,Sun Jul 19 12:19:52 2015 UTC,"I am absolutely in love with acrylic crystals, to me sapphire seems boring and when incorrectly done (poor ar coating, single layer etc)  rather ugly. I also prefer them because the vast majority of damage to them can be restored with tooth paste, while that same damage to sapphire would cause it to break into pieces (admittedly even if it means no scratches)"

If it wasn't obvious, keep the old bezel - it's the stuff vintage Rolex wackos' wet dreams are made of.  If I take a hammer to a Porsche Speedster, does that add patina?"

It aged beautifully and scratches on the bezel just give it uniqueness - every scratch tells a story and reflects the way this watch had been worn - the very definition on what makes vintage watches special. I hope it grows on you. Nevertheless, congratulations on the piece and enjoy it!"

Haven't purchased from them yet, but Chrono24 + Watchrecon is my go to combo for timepiece hunting."
Watches,3dn3os,ScintillatingOne,4,Fri Jul 17 18:52:05 2015 UTC,"Thought this was an interesting article prefacing the development of Chrono24 as they position themselves to become the place for buying watches online. Although i know it won't beat out the forums or eBay, it still has some promise for how they are approaching the handling of money and how good of a market place it can be.  Maybe we'll see them buy-out ABtW to compete with Hodinkee, Inc.?"
Watches,3dn3os,LTCM1998,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:50:03 2015 UTC,"Dunno if they will, as synergies might not be so huge. I mean sure there will be content and references to their market place, but getting paid reviews for Rolex et al might be harder as it won't  feed to Rolex in this case, but to Chrono24. So that aspect may make it tricky. I think they could in theory sell other stuff too, but frankly running a comission based house is fairly good low maintance business in relative terms. They keep a fee from sale of every watch and they make advertising money from content ads. I figure managing a blog with proprietary content is fraught with lots of issues. Guys like Hodinkee do it very well by making watch collecting popular in this pseudo hipster new money age. Their goal should just be  THE place to go for watch collectors and buyers to get a good price. If they nail that, and looks like they have - skys the limit."

Watches,3dn3os,Fileefree,3,Sat Jul 18 00:50:46 2015 UTC,"They are rolling out trusted checkout more and more, you transfer the money to Chrono24 who keep the money until you have received the watch and you are happy and then transfer the money to the seller only after that.

Watches,3dn3os,LTCM1998,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:27:21 2015 UTC,"Well, use your head. I mean dont buy where a pic is not original, where seller is not replying fast enough, dont buy stuff from Thailand or whatever - stick to US, Germany and other European sellers. If you got an occasional local seller for you, good. I generally wouldn't buy from far east anything, same for latin america. I want the buyer to speak some english, to have pics, to reply on time, and to explain the selling process proper. Ask for extra pics of any damage to the watch, etc. Dont ask for them to open the watch for you to take pics lest we talking about some expensive AL&S and whatnot (in that case they should have done that probably).   I have paid there as I posted above, and all went fine. Usually it is good to buy from a shop that has real life presence, Netherlands, Italy, UK all have those and are good to buy from I ""think"". At the end of the day, ask  on forums if anyone had experience with the seller you picked, usually someone will step forward  or PM you. Take it from there. Good luck.  Tursted Checkout is nice to have. Trusted Seller I understood was more of a badge for ad money they got and didnt truly guarantee much."

Watches,3dq8o2,suckingalemon,3,Sat Jul 18 11:40:57 2015 UTC,"The main argument that can be used to talk you out of it is that it's almost a direct copy of a very fashionable watch, the Nomos.  There's circumstantial evidence (most likely true, imo) that the same factory that makes Rodina also makes Nomos fakes from the same parts.  Also, Sea-gull themselves may have violated ETAs intellectual property at some point (I don't know too much of the details).  So there is somewhat of a moral dilemma here depending on how you read the situation, and what you believe your responsibility as a buyer is.  I am not the most discerning WIS out there, but the main difference that I can tell between the Nomos is that the Rodina is about 3mm thicker.  At $120, you pretty much can't argue against the sapphire crystal and the ST-17 movement.  The construction may be hit or miss, and the strap is poor.  Once you replace the strap, I think you've got a very good watch for the money.  Is it as nice as a Nomos or Stowa? Not at all, but in terms of value-for-money, it's pretty high (maybe not as much as a japanese watch).  The main thing to think about is that you will get people asking about it frequently.  It's not like a sub homage where you see 20 people with them every day, the Bauhaus design kind of sticks out, at least where I work.  People will be interested in it and you'll be saying 'it's a cheap chinese watch' a lot.  My advice is not to give a damn, but if this is awkward for you, it's something to think about.  Personally, I love mine, and I'm glad I bought it.  It's a lot of fun.  I have the sterile one, and the hands appear black when looked at straight on, but the blueness comes out when the light angles.  I was not aware of the date one, it is definitely different internals  (at least slightly).  Personally I don't think a date complication fits well with this style.  I have no comment on the quartz watch.  My only recommendation is that,  if it's your first watch, I'd push you towards a Japanese watch.  Chinese watches and homages are a whole lot of fun, and a great second watch, but the overall quality and refinement is not up to the level of Japanese watches, plus you can get a design that stands on it's own rather than in something elses shadow.  As a second, third, or 12th watch, the Rodina is a great cheap thrill,  though."

Even without the lume its super easy to see the time underwater so I can see why divers likes using these so much back in the day.

With most pocket watches, (I don't know a lot about stopwatches but I'm assuming they're similar) the cost to repair them is basically the same as doing maintenance on a regular mechanical watch. It will probably cost a few hundred dollars and it would be back to working normally and all shined up.  Chances are the stopwatch, once repaired, won't be worth much more than the service cost.

I'm not spending money on anything until I know.  Thanks!  EDIT:  I did just get one email response estimate of ""at least $400.""  Whoa."
Watches,3dmplm,tighran,3,Fri Jul 17 17:51:48 2015 UTC,"You generally won't get quotes over the phone or without a shop seeing the thing in person because the pool of potential problems and costs to fix them is too vast. It could be anything from simply opening the back and removing a stuck screw to a full teardown and service with several replacement parts.   People have a tendency to want a final price right off the bat without giving the shop adequate information for a cursory guess, and then they freak out and get mad when they finally trudge into the shop and are told that the scratch they said over the phone is actually a shattered crystal and there's a couple screws missing from the caseback so it's been flopping open and allowing a small planets worth of dirt inside for several months, so no it will more than a $15 battery change to make it run. Not that I know this from experience or anything."

Try the link I posted above and see if there's a watchmaker nearby that you can take it to, OP.   The problem is either very simple, or not cost-effective. I'll cross my fingers and hope for very simple. ;-)"
Watches,3dmplm,bonerwashington,2,Fri Jul 17 18:49:03 2015 UTC,"If you were on the fence about throwing it away, why don't you buy some watch tools and learn to fix it yourself?  I did that when I got into mechanical watches.  It's really fun to do, and it is easier than you may think.  The movement probably just needs to be disassembled, cleaned, oiled and reassembled.  You would just need a set of screwdrivers from Burgeon, a good pair of swiss tweezers, an eye loupe, some One Dip, Rodico cleaning putty, and a few other miscellaneous things.  I'm pretty sure Otto Frei sells a students tool kit for around $100 which has most of these things."

Watches,3dmplm,stevenharryw,2,Fri Jul 17 18:38:26 2015 UTC,"I've been learning about stopwatches and chronographs recently, and though there are weird intricacies to the market that I don't know about, I don't think this is anything real valuable. It is neat for being a pre-TAG piece, but I'm not sure that really gives much value to pretty basic stopwatch (there seem to be plenty on ebay) without any special racing or sport history or complications such as split seconds or weird yachting timer displays or whatever. The catalog you found shows it as a budget model, so I suspect it's pretty similar to what you'd find in a lesser-known brands stopwatch.  Personally I'd suggest forgetting about any value or serious repairs, and getting a cheap $15 watch tool set from amazon and just taking it apart and seeing what you can learn. You may be able to find something is just stuck, or replace a broken part using a donor movement from ebay, and even get it back together and running, but I don't think it's worth the cost for thorough cleaning and oiling, though I could be wrong.  If you at least pop the back off and take a picture, I suspect it's pretty similar to some pieces that I have and I could show some pictures of what you could expect to encounter."

I'm also going off the retail price, not unauthorized dealer prices. It's over 10k, but if he doesn't have a credit limit above 10k on a card, he shouldn't be considering the watch anyways.

I can't find this exact dial, but there is a black dial version set with diamonds.  I have an Oyster Perpetual Date with just a plain blue dial and smooth dome bezel, here. My parents bought it a Rolex AD this January and they were able to get a small percentage discount by paying in cash.  FYI, Rolex announced a new day-date movement with improved precision, power reserve, and shock resistance (Cal. 3255) at Baselworld this year (link to new Rolex Day-Date w/ 3255). Personally, I am currently saving up for a Rolex with an updated movement. The 3135 movement featured in the watch you're interested in has been around since the late 80's I believe.  [Edit] - As a side note, one thing about this Rolex that I am not a fan of is the polished center links. It is scratch prone. I will be looking for a brushed bracelet (e.g. Rolex sports models such as Explorer, Submariner, etc.) next time around."

I really love the design of both of these watches, and the good things I hear about Seiko quality in general. I had the one on the left as my first purchase less than a year ago, with this one on the right was a more recent purchase. I regret neither one (so far!). They look amazing, in my opinion, in person!  The one on the left is a SKA366 model, and the one on the right is a SARB065. The SARB065 I learned about from r/watches, while the SKA366 I stumbled upon when one day randomly browsing watches. Both watches had good reviews (and a fair number of them), which was part of the reason I pulled the trigger on them. I wasn't intentionally trying to only purchase Seiko watches, it just turns out that the watches that caught my eye were these two, made by Seiko."

My anecdotal experience is Panerai's design is an aquired taste as I didn't like them before and the more photos I saw the more I liked them.

So I'm the guy who has the Railmaster trio, but in the last few months I had some personal issues come up so I had to sell the modern Railmaster... which, to be honest, was the least impressive of the bunch. Meanwhile, this 2914 had some rust on the dial so I took it to a watchmaker, who helped me clean it up a little. But it caused some discoloration, which I don't mind at all. A month later, I got caught in the rain with the 2914 and I found some condensation on the crystal the next morning. So I immediately took it to a watchmaker, who also found some issues with the crown and thought it needed a full service + new gaskets. I obliged. One month later, she's back on my wrist. The rain did cause a little damage. I don't even care. She is mine, imperfections and all.  Oh and the strap: From Hodinkee. Costs a shitload. But the best strap I've ever owned."

That's a nice idea. You don't want to look messy if you're having sophistomocated cocktails!  However I think it's because it's a single-fold deployant, so it folds in the same way as if it were a bracelet, which means the end ends up on the inside.

Maybe I didn't do something right, so I'll post here too since this is technically my watch for the day but it's not on my wrist :'(  While riding my motorcycle I assume my jacket caught the crown and it popped off. I just realized I should've taken a side view, but I left the watch at home. It doesn't look like anything's broken, just the crown popped out and fell who knows where. I tried searching for a replacement piece online, but all I get are new Timex watch results. Is it time to get a new watch, or are replacement crowns out there somewhere?  http://imgur.com/6jlVNhw  Stock Image  Any help would be greatly appreciated."

Nomos as a company has the tech knowledge to produce some very nice movements. Back in 2004 they made a Tourbillion for Wempe Here & Here and another chronometer movement for Wempe Here & Here A similar movement is in the Lux and Lambda (you can read about it Here)  They still manufacture the movement in house and while it was designed elsewhere, to me, doesn't make that any less special."

This watch may usher in an era of very affordable automatic watches for consumers (or watch geeks), but for me, it is more than that.  In creating this watch, Swatch added another item to the list of complex tasks once exclusive to the human repertoire, that a machine can now perform just as well if not better.

Watches,3do76s,StanS2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:44:18 2015 UTC,"I don't see what Seiko has to do with this.  Regardless of price/value, the point is Swatch did something no one else did, which was fully automate the manufacturing process for an automatic watch.  It remains to be seen exactly what influence that will have on the industry; some companies might start doing the same, or they may not.  But if automatic watches manufactured in this manner were to become very common in the near future, and if they were priced lower than say, what Seiko has to offer, then a new era would indeed have been ushered in.  Nowhere did I state that affordable, high quality automatic watches are not already available.  Not the first step toward Skynet.  But a step nonetheless.  Really, any process/product that we create, that involves the automation of a cognitively complex task, is a step.  But a watch is a nice, compact, wearable package that makes it easier for me to see it that way."

Watches,3dkodp,baldylox,26,Fri Jul 17 01:21:08 2015 UTC,"Full album is here.    I decided to do something a little fun this week. No fancy watches. No awesome vintage Russian watch. No antique Omega pocket watch. Nope. I bought the cheapest watch out there. I was buying some vitamins my wife wanted on Amazon when these little $15 watches kept popping up. I had to search for a while to find a style that I liked. Most of them are skeleton watches. I'm not into that. So I decided on this little guy here. $15 worth of automatic Chinese awesomeness. But that remains to be seen, doesn't it?  I've decided to wear this watch everywhere for a week and report back next week with the endurance test. I'm doing a lot of outdoor farm chores and also indoor construction this week. It's going to be put to the test.  The Unboxing  The unboxing was very anti-climactic. They really need to work on their presentation. This watch was shipped halfway around the world in a very thin plastic sleeve, inside of a non-padded envelope, inside of another barely padded envelope.  That's no way to ship a watch! Does it even work? $15 my ass!  Appreciating the Beauty  This watch features a cheaply-made chrome-plated case, a black strap that's made of something, a nice domed thick acrylic crystal, automatic mechanical movement, and a screw-on display caseback. And yes, it works - and nicely.  On my timegrapher it's throwing out very nice readings. I have yet to open it. I was satisfied right out of the bag. It's well regulated and running strong - for any watch that was shipped halfway around the world with virtually no protection.  That's a lot to ask of a $15 watch.  Critiquing the Beauty  I love the design overall - kind of a modern vintage military style. It's branded ""Winner"". They've kind of stolen Rotary's 'winged wheel' logo, which I've always loved, and made it look cheap. The logo itself just looks cheap. It would look better with no logo. Makes me wonder how easy it would come off ... we may just find that out.  It has green indices at the 3, 6, 9, & 12. They do not glow in the dark. The one under the 6 is a little smeared. The crown and stem mechanisms were very stiff at first. Pulling it in and out a few times fixed that issue. The date is a quickset - crown halfway out. It's an automatic movement, but winds more like a mechanical movement. It's actually pretty smooth.  For my experiment, I wound the watch once before I put it on. I have to see how 'automatic' it is, right?  The strap is garbage that's made cheaper than straps I buy in bulk from an Ali Baba wholesaler for less than $1 each. One of the two fake leather loops broke within a few hours.  Hey, it's a $15 watch.  Display Caseback  A display caseback! Cool! Why, I don't know. That is one ugly, chunky little movement. I don't want to see that in the same way I'd rather not watch sausage being made.  The manufacturer though so much of it that there are no visible markings on the movement that I can see, but like I said, I haven't opened it up.  Mowing and doing chores and working up a sweat, I noticed that it's fogging up from the inside. Moisture is getting in somehow. I'm tempted to do nothing - for science, but I'm also tempted to take the caseback off and see that no gasket was ever installed. I have a lot of gaskets. For now, I'm still going with as-is.  After a week of abusing this little beauty, I'll report back on how it's doing.  Enjoy!"

Watches,3dkodp,Mgotham,13,Fri Jul 17 03:56:14 2015 UTC,"Hey ... pro-tip:  Everything is machine washable if you know that you're too lazy to go to the cleaners anyway.   I used to have a system of washer & dryer Darwinism when I was a single guy. I was single until 38.   Most any 'dry clean only' stuff come out of there just fine. The rest of it gets culled. I didn't want it. Survival of the fittest laundry! I own expensive suits that have been through there many times and still look great.   I also had some stuff that I ended up giving to people who own chihuahuas.   'Dry clean only' is just a warning, or a dare, depending on your point of view.   Now I've been married for close to 7 years and I'm not allowed to touch the laundry. My wife thinks that my system of never sorting anything is bad. Whatever."

Watches,3dngwz,cdomestics,3,Fri Jul 17 18:24:50 2015 UTC,"I preordered the Mako USA and it arrived this week. I'm loving it so far. One of the reasons that I went for the Mako USA over the Mako/Ray was because of the sapphire crystal and better looking dial (my personal preference). So far I'm really enjoying it. It goes really well with all of my NATO straps and build quality for $225 is fantastic. The sapphire crystal is however slightly recessed from the bezel so if you're worried about dust or lint getting stuck in there, then that is a legitimate issue. However, it is relatively easy to just get a toothpick and get the dust and lint out and a slightly recessed crystal would be less prone to dents and scratches. In the end, it's really up to you. Even at $225, it is still a fantastic value considering all that you're getting."

Watches,3dmmsi,Jamo747,3,Fri Jul 17 14:35:32 2015 UTC,"This is my little collection that I started quite recently and I thought I'd share it. As you can see I have developed a little fetish for Swatches and just couldn't stop myself from buying more. I did get a Seiko snk 809 because it seems kind of customary around these parts and it caught my eye when I was looking for a bang for buck mechanical watch and I plan on getting a good strap for it soon, I just can't seem to find a good quality strap for under $50 AUD. I would try to find a decent mechanical watch I like but they all seem a bit out of my price range, and I don't see the value of buying an entry level Swiss mechanical for around $600 AUD just to get it serviced a few years down the track.  There's also a G-Shock there for practical reasons, I do love the little bugger and I plan on getting some more later on. I got the F-91W because I wanted to get an iconic watch for as cheap as I could and in my mind nothing beats an F-91W for that.  As for the Swatches, I got the Blue Choco (blue face and brown strap) the same day as the Seiko and just fell in love with it and so I bought one after another and ended up joining the Swatch Club in my craze. I got the Swatch irony in a mystery box deal for $30 AUD which I think was quite a deal. I'm thinking of getting a Sistem 51 next week as they seem very interesting, that being it's a mechanical watch entirely made by machines and only has 51 parts.  Anyways I thought I'd share my new found hobby that I have lots of fun with. I know a lot of people say not to buy watches for the sake of collecting them, but to buy them for their horological merits but I do have a lot of fun with the Swatches and if people don't like that, well meh!"

Watches,3dkcac,Santa_009,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:37:39 2015 UTC,"I'd love these but i can't help but think how much these watches would slow down, the friction amongst so many components must be incredible, or at least power hungry to run (for a watch)."
Watches,3dkcac,gleam,2,Fri Jul 17 10:39:52 2015 UTC,"I mean, these all tend to keep pretty average or above-average time for a high-end mechanical watch. Modern synthetic lubricants and liberal use of synthetic jewel bearings help a lot with friction. The more complicated watches typically will use at least two mainsprings in order to provide enough torque to the escapement to keep accurate time while maintaining a useful power reserve.   I would expect these watches to all stay within +/- 10 seconds per day, and they should realistically be within +/- 5 seconds per day. That's not bad.  One thing to note: the Devon Tread is not a purely mechanical watch. It's electronic, with a battery."
Watches,3dmb8c,whataboutmydynamite,4,Fri Jul 17 12:49:36 2015 UTC,"Gruen, Elgin, Wittnauer. Waltham, Douglas, Clinton, Hampden. Etc.  Bear in mind, too, that many mid-range Swiss importers to the US used different names for watches sold through specific department stores or jewellers, so that those stores could claim them as ""exclusives"". If you can identify those sub-brands, you might get a really good deal.  While most of those watches are well-made with solid, workhorse movements, they're often not worth the cost of a service to get them back into working order, and they're definitely not worth the cost of a significant repair for worn or broken parts. If you find a vintage watch that you really like, and it appears to be keeping decent time and wind/autowind without grinding, then it may be worth a gamble."

Watches,3dib4k,baldylox,7,Thu Jul 16 17:04:27 2015 UTC,"So, as I mentioned yesterday, my grandfather (who died before I was born) collected watches, and this is what really got me into the obsession. My father and I currently take turns wearing and trading the different watches in his collection, and yesterday he traded me this vintage Zodiac Astrographic SST ""Mystery Hands"" timepiece for the Ernest Borel I had been wearing/keeping (posted that one here yesterday: https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/3ddwmx/ernest_borel_my_grandfather_who_died_before_i_was/).   This one is actually REALLY cool, because the hands all ""float"" on the watch's face. The red-dot second-hand literally just floats around the outside rim of the watch face, and, because it's an automatic, it just sweeps along there in a pretty trippy fashion. I'm a really big fan of this one, and was happy to trade my dad the Borel for it (for the time being at least!!). I hope that you guys enjoy seeing it!!    Here is an album with some more images of the watch: http://imgur.com/a/3V4w5"

Watches,3dmxq9,EasierLikeThis,3,Fri Jul 17 16:01:17 2015 UTC,"I was also debating between those two brands at one point as well and ultimately decided to go for a Nomos Tangente 38.  The only issue I can see with the Orion is that it would be slightly harder to wear with more casual attire (jeans) which is why I opted for a Tangente since it straddles dress/casual look.  Personally I don't think you can go wrong either one I did find this older review in which he complains about the strap.  The only other factor would be Nomos inhouse movement vs the Chronoscope having a modified ETA 7750.  You can check out the Frederique Constant Peking to Paris which has different color variants there was a recent reddit post on it, though it is quite larger at 43mm."
Watches,3dmxq9,BearGryllss,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:49:22 2015 UTC,"The only other factor would be Nomos inhouse movement vs the Chronoscope having a modified ETA 7750.   Thanks for the reply. Tell me a bit more what you mean here. Is it just a matter of fact point you're making (they have different movements), or is there one that's more desirable than the other? (Or is it just preference at this point?)"
Watches,3dmxq9,BearGryllss,2,Fri Jul 17 18:31:32 2015 UTC,"It's really just a matter of preference.  I think most watch enthusiasts would find it more desirable to own a watch that is manufactured in-house (more exclusive) vs. owning a watch that has a more ubiquitous movement.  Ultimately it is up to what you want in a watch, I just brought up the movement because some people do care about it."
Watches,3dmxq9,Uncle_Erik,2,Fri Jul 17 20:26:11 2015 UTC,"I'll give you the other side.  I don't like watches with in-house movements.  Why?  I think we're in a watch bubble.  An amazing amount of new brands have hit the market and everyone is scrambling to make their own movements.  That's about exclusivity and being able to raise the price.  There are two importants things to remember:   An in-house movement usually offers no real advantage.  An ETA movement is often just as good of a timekeeper.  This is just snob appeal. If the company ever goes under, you won't be able to find parts for your watch.  The economy won't be rosy forever and when things go downhill, luxury goods are always the first to go.  A lot of these little boutique manufacturers are going to fail.  You won't be able to get parts for your watch and, even if it's running, values will fall through the floor.   My advice is to get a watch with a common movement, like an ETA 2824.  Parts will be available for the next couple hundred years, at least.  It's a hell of a good movement and the only knock against it is that it's common.  So what?  Honda Civics are common, does that mean they're poorly made crap?  Nope.  They're good cars, but you can't snob it up about exclusivity.  Personally, I wear a Sinn 656 with an ETA 2824 movement.  Great watch and I know I'll keep it running for the rest of my life.  I'm planning to buy a Rolex Explorer I sooner or later.  Because I know the Rolex 3130 will always be able to be serviced.  As for pretty much all others, I'm skeptical if the companies will still exist 20 years from now.  My ETA runs very, very well and I think I'll be happy with a 3130, as well."
Watches,3dmxq9,HopHeed2113,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:22:17 2015 UTC,"Not to not-pick, but keep in mind that it comes in three different tiers, so be sure to ask which 2824 is used. 2892 is the newer and more robust ETA offering and the 2892A2 is even more refined."
Watches,3dmxq9,BearGryllss,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:47:10 2015 UTC,"I understand now, and you pointed me to a detail I hadn't noticed (clearly, I have much to learn). Thank you."
Watches,3dmxq9,SiliconLifeform,2,Fri Jul 17 20:36:55 2015 UTC,"No problem!  I should note that it isn't necessarily bad to own a non in-house movement, I mean there is a reason why many watches use ETA variants, the 7750 in particular is reliable and used quite a lot in chronographs.  You can probably search for articles explaining pro/cons of movement types.  Typically for in-house you are paying a lot more (i.e. Rolex, Omega) which is why the Nomos gets so much love since it is fairly affordable."
Watches,3dmx5x,Silvire,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:56:53 2015 UTC,Personally I find the dial of the chronograph a little busy.  I have a 2531.80 and think it is perfect.   Are you more concerned with having the iconic watch from the movie or the functionality of a chronograph?   Also fwiw both the 2531.80 and 2541.80 make appearances in the bond film at different points.
Watches,3dmx5x,twwyt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:42:12 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't know that. Nice to know.  After some thinking, I think I prize the iconic look (that is, the chronograph) more. Just slightly more than the functionality of a chronograph.  I feel the same way, I think the chronograph is a little cluttered and as such detracts from the beauty of the dial. As it is, it's a little hard to see the wave design on the dial with so many things there.  Damn. I just answered myself, right?"
Watches,3dmx5x,Mgotham,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:45:04 2015 UTC,"I have to agree... the chronograph is just way too cluttered and I'm not a huge fan of the 4 crowns either. There's just too much going on.   For things like timing coffee and such, isn't that what the bezel is perfect for though?"
Watches,3dmx5x,Mgotham,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:57:54 2015 UTC,"Yep the bezel can do too.   I haven't actually had the opportunity to use the bezel before.  I heard some of the Seamasters have bezels that only have 24 clicks instead of 120 clicks. But I guess I'd need to check which models those are, exactly!  Also wondering if the bezels are as hard to turn as the Seiko Monsters. Those are an absolute bitch to turn. But if it's anything like my Aquaracer, it'll be fine!"
Watches,3dmx5x,Dangld,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:19:43 2015 UTC,only have 24 clicks instead of 120   That sounds like it would only be on a GMT time watch where the bezel is for a second time zone.
