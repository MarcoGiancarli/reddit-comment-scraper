When more than half the 25 man roster shows up for your birthday during one of your precious few off-days, I'd say you're a pretty well-respected leader. Based on performance, he probably doesn't belong but based on this, you see why the Yanks are in no rush to yank him."

NYYankees,3e2vu0,Intelligenttrees,2,Tue Jul 21 18:36:55 2015 UTC,Those numbers are bit skewed because of how incredible he was the before the DL stint last year. He is still yet to get back to that level of dominance
NYYankees,3e2vu0,Irreversible_Rape,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:13:32 2015 UTC,"He had a 2.49 ERA in 43.1 IP this year between opening day and his 6/21 implosion against the Tigers. That's pretty dominant IMO.  Those two bad starts in a row (the Tigers game and the Astros one) make him look worse than he is because he's only thrown 74 innings this year, so they have more of an impact on his season stats. If he pitches the way he has been since those starts, he'll probably end up with an ERA in the low 3.00 range.  Outside of those two starts, he's pitched to a 2.67 ERA this year, more or less what I'd expect from a #1 in the AL East. His high ERA can be attributed almost completely to those two games, as opposed to, say, CC, where it's one dogshit game after another."

NYYankees,3dz0b4,FairEnough,0,Tue Jul 21 16:19:09 2015 UTC,CC for Cano. Let's do it.
NYYankees,3dyri1,ndevito1,15,Mon Jul 20 17:02:00 2015 UTC,"Of course Cash will say that.  It's the Yankees. If he says ""we're in the market for another starter or 2B"", other teams will raise their prices, and/or rival teams would likely make inquiries just to raise the price and put more pressure on the Yankees to give up better parts.  Last few years I don't remember Cash ever saying that he wanted to make a huge deal, yet we saw plenty of very good moves made. I have faith."
NYYankees,3dyri1,HateMcLouth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:41:47 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, other teams know we need a second basemen and are already asking for better talent. I believe in refsnyder and pirela, they can possibly take over later in the season, if things get dire and we take a risk."
NYYankees,3dyri1,clonekiller,5,Tue Jul 21 04:15:10 2015 UTC,"I actually kinda see where Cash is coming from. Rather than regurgitate stuff I've read elsewhere, I think this article over on LoHud did a nice job last week in IDing how the Yankees aren't in a great position to upgrade significantly with how their roster is:  http://yankees.lhblogs.com/2015/07/16/yankees-strange-spot-heading-toward-trade-deadline/  I mean they still could but they have viable options at basically every position."
NYYankees,3dyri1,hector92,4,Mon Jul 20 17:09:32 2015 UTC,I really like the idea of trading for one of the second-tier starters like Shields or especially Latos if they could be had for a similar level prospect to what we got McCarthy for last season (maybe Bryan Mitchell).  Go with a 6-man rotation for a while as most of the rotation could use the rest anyway.    The team is probably going to make the playoffs and it's huge gamble to roll with this rotation as currently constructed.  Pineda's coming off shoulder surgery and hasn't thrown this many innings since 2011 when he threw 170.  Tanaka...obviously.  We're depending on those guys to carry the rotation.  edit: I was thinking we had traded Peter Obrien for McCarthy last season.  That's where the Mitchell comp came from.
NYYankees,3dyri1,TheGoMLStick,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:09:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I mean if you could build a franchise from scratch, I've heard the best way to do it is to build up the middle. Get a good shortstop and 2nd baseman, Center fielder. That sort of thing. I just can't believe that this team, with the age of its players, and the injury history's, that we can win with Didi Gregorious and Rob Refsynder at short and second. People like IR will make you believe we can, but it's doubtful unless guys like Tex and Arod continue to just hammer the ball relentlessly. I've also heard Arod is slightly trending downward in batted ball velocity which is concerning. If we could land a legit middle infielder that isn't going to hit 170 like drew, and some sort of reliable starter, then I think we can win the WS."
NYYankees,3dyri1,RangerPL,9,Mon Jul 20 23:02:03 2015 UTC,It'd be cool if we traded for Prado again though

NYYankees,3dyri1,L8Knight,4,Mon Jul 20 20:40:27 2015 UTC,O'Brein has always hit well he just doesn't really have a position.
NYYankees,3dyri1,DuckingShot,3,Tue Jul 21 03:55:30 2015 UTC,"He says this every year.  They almost always get someone, but very rarely get the superstar.

NYYankees,3dyri1,Blitz93,2,Mon Jul 20 20:38:33 2015 UTC,It's really encouraging to hear him say they basically refuse to trade Judge or Severino. Can't wait to see those two in the future.

NYYankees,3dv8oj,HateMcLouth,20,Sun Jul 19 20:42:13 2015 UTC,"For some reason i hate the Orioles even more than the Sox, probably because of Buck and the fact that their fanbase has no idea how to handle winning"
NYYankees,3dv8oj,Wipeout17,11,Sun Jul 19 21:03:18 2015 UTC,"Yea they're pretty insufferable.  On par with Royals fans.  They take more pleasure in us losing than them winning.  It's incredibly and pathetically sad.  They all say they've been die hard fans since birth, but that's bullshit.  I lived in Annapolis pre and post 2012, and let's just say the difference in Oriole fandom during that time was remarkable."
NYYankees,3dv8oj,pinata_penis_pump2,4,Sun Jul 19 22:04:10 2015 UTC,I've lived in the mid Atlantic for over 15 years and I have to disagree. There have always been a lot of orioles fans. They just weren't as prone to shit talk cause the orioles weren't good.
NYYankees,3dv8oj,John_YJKR,3,Mon Jul 20 00:45:57 2015 UTC,That's an issue with a lot of teams. They suck ass until one season when they suddenly are decent. Then they act like they're all hot shit.
NYYankees,3dv8oj,JawshD123,12,Mon Jul 20 02:19:21 2015 UTC,It's amazing how much Mariners fans hate us. Getting their asses handed to them by us is a yearly ritual for the Mariners.
NYYankees,3dv8oj,RangerPL,10,Sun Jul 19 23:29:52 2015 UTC,"As a Yankee fan who lives near Seattle.....understood  This city is still very threatened by the Yankees. The 2 years they really expected the WS were ended by our doing. Also, Seattle's most hated player in A-Rod, eventually wound up with us, increasing their hatred.   And not to mention, it all comes down to the culture of Seattle. This is a left coast town, super liberal and anti-big business. (Which is hilarious, considering this is the home of Amazon, Boeing, and Microsoft) The very existence of the Yankees is against their idealism. We are the cigar puffin, take whatever we want bad guys. East coasters, and they don't like us. Our playoff victories and A-Rod only increase that."
NYYankees,3dv8oj,Rather_Unique1994,8,Mon Jul 20 00:13:20 2015 UTC,I've been stationed out here since 2012. And Seattle fans are hard to deal with at times. It's the same with football. They are very obnoxious. That's not to say the area isn't good. It is. And outside of sports the people are usually pretty cool.
NYYankees,3dv8oj,John_YJKR,2,Mon Jul 20 00:52:18 2015 UTC,Whoooo I'm not the only Yankees fan living near Seattle.

NYYankees,3dv8oj,tekneticc,15,Mon Jul 20 01:40:49 2015 UTC,Imagine any other team having Betances and him not being their closer. Its crazy.  A couple of important things to note from today even though we won:   Tex is God The Yankees rock.
NYYankees,3dv8oj,Forever__Young,11,Sun Jul 19 20:24:25 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is Miller's ever so slightly better based on the most common stats. No reason to ""fix"" what ain't broken.   Having Betances dominate the 8th and sometimes even clean up the seventh reminds me of Rivera in '95. Probably getting ahead of myself but a man can dream..."
NYYankees,3dv8oj,yrogerg123,7,Sun Jul 19 20:30:38 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I definitely agree, our pen is just unreal this season. And yeah going in with even 1 run to the 8th just seems like a win already, even though you are getting ahead of yourself."
NYYankees,3dv8oj,Forever__Young,5,Sun Jul 19 20:33:52 2015 UTC,And yeah going in with even 1 run to the 8th just seems like a win already   That's how I felt in game 7 of the 2001 WS.  :(
NYYankees,3dv8oj,fec2245,9,Mon Jul 20 00:25:02 2015 UTC,Why?  Why must you hurt me so?
NYYankees,3dv8oj,LeDudicus,4,Mon Jul 20 00:43:16 2015 UTC,I'm sorry I dug up that painful memory.  Whenever someone says the game is over in the 9th I can't help but think of it.  I was 11 and when we got to the 9th I fell asleep confident that we had won.  :(
NYYankees,3dv8oj,fec2245,6,Mon Jul 20 02:31:16 2015 UTC,They were about the same age when they recorded their first saves
NYYankees,3dv8oj,THEY_FOUND_ME_OUT,2,Sun Jul 19 20:58:18 2015 UTC,Have we seen Miller take on multiple innings? Rarely if ever IIRC. Betances can be trusted to work more than an inning with his stuff.
NYYankees,3dv8oj,conorLIED,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:10:33 2015 UTC,"Right...so let Miller always do the ninth and then let Betances clean up the seventh occasionally on top of locking down the eighth. Exactly what's been happening.  It's actually an old sabermetric idea to have a bullpen ace who's not the closer to take on the highest leverage situations. Sometimes that's the ninth, but oftentimes it isn't. I trust Betances in those situations, but frankly I'd trust either so it doesn't really matter."
NYYankees,3dv8oj,yrogerg123,11,Mon Jul 20 12:43:00 2015 UTC,We just joined the 50 win club on the same day that the Red Sux will likely join the 50 loss club. Their are few things in this life better than that.
NYYankees,3dv8oj,Wipeout17,12,Sun Jul 19 22:20:10 2015 UTC,"Missed the game, but it seemed like CC must have pitched really well today. How did he look?"
NYYankees,3dv8oj,yrogerg123,17,Sun Jul 19 20:27:02 2015 UTC,"Solid, maybe one or two bad pitches all game and some sick K's."
NYYankees,3dv8oj,Forever__Young,9,Sun Jul 19 20:29:36 2015 UTC,That sounds encouraging.
NYYankees,3dv8oj,yrogerg123,9,Sun Jul 19 21:04:03 2015 UTC,7 ks. 6 solid innings. Big Mike let us down a bit last night but cc took care of business. Another series win and win number 50. 90 wins is realistic for this team.

He's a good leader and he plays the game with a ton of passion. No matter how good or bad he pitches, he's always someone who's gonna stick up for his teammates and I respect the fuck out of him for that"

NYYankees,3drr2r,Irreversible_Rape,13,Sat Jul 18 21:06:39 2015 UTC,Yeah but all 4 runs were from two homers by the same hitter. Discouraging but nothing to make you think there something wrong.
NYYankees,3drr2r,John_YJKR,-4,Sat Jul 18 21:34:29 2015 UTC,"Doesn't excuse him for laying 2 cookies up there to their second best hitter. He cant be throwing that shit to their best hitters, they only got like 3 hitters in the whole fucking lineup that can hurt you. Especially when we come back to tie it at 2-2, our ace is supposed to bear down and keep them at 2 runs"
NYYankees,3drr2r,Irreversible_Rape,5,Sun Jul 19 01:20:17 2015 UTC,You really think Cano is their second best hitter?  By what metric?  He got 25% of this season's HRs in this game.
NYYankees,3drr2r,fec2245,-1,Sun Jul 19 02:48:07 2015 UTC,Duh of course he is their second best hitter.
NYYankees,3drr2r,Irreversible_Rape,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:58:02 2015 UTC,"With a 0.8 oWAR?  He's not second on Seattle in SLG, OBS, AVG, HR, OPS, oWAR.  How is he their second best hitter this season?  I loved Cano when he was on the Yankees but this season he hasn't been doing much of anything."
NYYankees,3drr2r,fec2245,-1,Sun Jul 19 03:06:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah okay, he might have the third best numbers on the team right now, but I bet you wouldn't put a dime down that Cano wont finish with the second best numbers on the team. He's going to break out in the second half, we all know it. Everyone who knows anything knows he is still the second best hitter on their team, he has not suddenly become washed up overnight at 32 years old"
NYYankees,3drr2r,Irreversible_Rape,0,Sun Jul 19 03:25:08 2015 UTC,Uh ... probably Seager is our #2 best hitter.  Cano is the #8th best hitter on the M's by wRC+ with at least 50 PAs.  There is no way Cano will finish as our #2 best hitter.  He's had that horrid of a season.  Seriously.
NYYankees,3drr2r,mega_shit,0,Sun Jul 19 04:36:34 2015 UTC,I would account bet you Cano finishes with better numbers than Seager this year
NYYankees,3drr2r,Irreversible_Rape,-16,Sun Jul 19 04:50:01 2015 UTC,Another start exemplifying just how untrustworthy Pineda is.   Maybe it was rust after the break but quality starters don't make the same mistake to the same hitter twice. He's not the brightest bulb on the hill.
NYYankees,3drr2r,rkwittem,6,Sat Jul 18 20:49:40 2015 UTC,"Yes they do. I'm pretty sure Tex or Big Mac hit the grand slap against Felix last time and had a great day at the plate. No matter how good the pitcher, they just have one that sees them better than the rest."
NYYankees,3drr2r,Qui-Bong,-2,Sat Jul 18 20:53:45 2015 UTC,Yeah well then you can explain to me why both pitches to Cano were straight fastballs in the same part of the plate.
NYYankees,3drr2r,rkwittem,4,Sat Jul 18 20:59:36 2015 UTC,"I can't agree because I didn't start watching the game till after, so I didn't see where the pitches were. Missed location is all. You can miss your pitch hundreds of times and a lot of times, batters still won't touch it. But the point of this, is Cano doesn't miss."
NYYankees,3drr2r,Qui-Bong,11,Sat Jul 18 21:08:46 2015 UTC,"Pineda pitches to a 3.77 ERA: ""HE'S SO UNRELIABLE""  Tanaka pitches to a 3.65 ERA: ""HE'S EITHER HURT OR A BUST""  Warren pitches to a 3.59 ERA: ""KEEP HIM IN THE ROTATION, HE'S OUR ACE""  TIL 0.18 ERA is the difference between an ace and AJ Burnett 2.0"
NYYankees,3drr2r,RangerPL,-8,Sat Jul 18 22:00:28 2015 UTC,"Pineda has been pretty up and down all year. Good start, then dumpster fire. Good start, then another shitty outing.  He's another Burnett."
NYYankees,3drr2r,rkwittem,7,Sat Jul 18 22:25:54 2015 UTC,He's another Burnett.   I don't think that means what you think it means. Burnett had a 4+ ERA in all three of his years with us and a 5+ ERA in his last two.
NYYankees,3drr2r,RangerPL,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:59:58 2015 UTC,"Not jumping on Pineda as bad, but to be honest that was in an ERA where 3.1 won you an ERA title. Those days are long gone, and like 3 dozen guys are below 3.1."
NYYankees,3drr2r,rightc0ast,5,Sun Jul 19 01:04:43 2015 UTC,"That's true, but AJ Burnett's ERA- in 2010 and 2011: 124  Pineda's ERA- this year: 92  It's not even close  2009 was the last year when the league was so skewed towards offense."
NYYankees,3drr2r,RangerPL,-2,Sun Jul 19 01:08:21 2015 UTC,It means that his physical gifts and talent are obvious but the results are more underwhelming than they are exemplary.
NYYankees,3drr2r,rkwittem,2,Sun Jul 19 02:06:27 2015 UTC,"After Pineda's shoulder surgery, it's miraculous he's pitching at all, never mind being above league average."
NYYankees,3drr2r,RangerPL,-2,Sun Jul 19 03:10:05 2015 UTC,Yeah we should totally lower our standards. Nevermind that this guy will be our Game 2 starter in a playoff series.  That inspire confidence in you? I'd almost rather use him in G1 and use Tanaka in G2 to at least give us the best chance at a split in the first 2 games.
NYYankees,3drr2r,rkwittem,2,Sun Jul 19 03:15:19 2015 UTC,"So was AJ Burnett, and we won a World Series with him as our #2 starter.  And yes, Pineda does inspire confidence in me. He would either be tied for #1 or in sole possession of the ace role on every team in the AL East except the Rays. He's not Scherzer, but he gives the team a chance to win nearly every time he takes the mound. We lost today's game because of our offense, a pitcher should expect more than three runs of support."
NYYankees,3drr2r,RangerPL,-1,Sun Jul 19 04:01:51 2015 UTC,"The 09 team was considerably better than this iteration, which allowed Burnett a much higher amount of room for error.   For one, our bullpen was about as good then as now, maybe a tick better for depth. Hughes, Robertson, Mo was really solid.   The team also had the stability of Pettitte behind Burnett, which this team also lacks. I like Eovaldi but he's also not close to being a complete pitcher. Unless you think CC would start a playoff game...   And yes, Pineda does inspire confidence in me. He would either be tied for #1 or in sole possession of the ace role on every team in the AL East except the Rays. He's not Scherzer, but he gives the team a chance to win nearly every time he takes the mound.   Yeah, he gives them a great shot when he has double-digit K stuff. He had a good April, an average May, and was terrible in June. Teams hit .300 against him when he's the visiting pitcher.   He can't afford to be a shithead on the mound and keep blowing winnable games because he thinks he can sneak a fastball by Cano."
NYYankees,3drr2r,rkwittem,2,Sun Jul 19 04:58:47 2015 UTC,k
NYYankees,3drr2r,IAMADeinonychusAMA,-4,Sun Jul 19 05:58:08 2015 UTC,I'm not going to go that far and say Pineda is Burnett. Eovaldi however.
NYYankees,3dvepl,therealjgreens,10,Sun Jul 19 21:11:33 2015 UTC,"We already have an absolutely shutdown bullpen, and would be easily outbid by teams that actually need a closer.  Warren/Shreve/Wilson/Betances/Miller is more than enough."
NYYankees,3dvepl,teniaava,2,Sun Jul 19 21:29:35 2015 UTC,I'd still make a stab at him or Chapman. The Yankees as much as anyone else could use the ability to shorten games more. Especially with CC and Eovaldi probably throwing 4 and 5 all year. They both eat the hell out of our bullpen being 5 inning guys now. In CC's case it sometimes costs gsmes since his 5th and 6th inning numbers are very bad. First four are servicable.
NYYankees,3dvepl,rightc0ast,2,Mon Jul 20 00:47:15 2015 UTC,"Dude Chapman is probably going to be the hardest get of anyone. Especially if Cueto is leaving they are gonna want something huge for their second best player. If you think giving up Shreve plus Severino or Judge is worth one inning every other day, I think you are insane."
NYYankees,3dvepl,XlPoLaR04,4,Tue Jul 21 16:58:16 2015 UTC,"As you add elite relievers, you begin seeing diminishing returns because there are only so many high-leverage innings to go around. Assembling a bullpen of 7 2.0 WAR pitchers doesn't mean you'll get 14 wins out of the bullpen.  Because of that, with Kimbrel, we'd be paying for a closer, but getting middle reliever value."
NYYankees,3dvepl,RangerPL,3,Sun Jul 19 22:28:53 2015 UTC,"Id imagine one of them would be included in a deal if it were to happen, but in hindsight of making this post, that would be dumb."
NYYankees,3dvepl,TheGoMLStick,2,Sun Jul 19 22:41:46 2015 UTC,"If this team decides to trade prospects, it's most likely going to be for a middle infielder or starter. It would be like us trading for another DH when we basically have two already. A top tier closer would be awesome to see, but the price is most likely way to high."
NYYankees,3dvepl,XlPoLaR04,2,Sun Jul 19 21:32:31 2015 UTC,"Not to mention we have 2 of the best closers in the league right now. And everyone outside of KC, San Diego, and Oakland would easily be upgraded by one of them."
NYYankees,3dvepl,locke0479,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:52 2015 UTC,"If they can make an upgrade to the bullpen at a reasonable price, I'm fine with it even with the strong bullpen, but the issue with Kimbrel is his cost. You'd have to trade a very strong prospect to improve something that doesn't really need improving."
NYYankees,3dvepl,Bilk_Ozbi,-1,Sun Jul 19 22:03:39 2015 UTC,"His market value is pretty fuckin high, so youre right"
NYYankees,3dvepl,Bilk_Ozbi,2,Sun Jul 19 22:05:46 2015 UTC,"Let's trade our top prospects for someone we don't need to do a job that someone else is already doing really well.  I feel like whenever we get one of these, ""Let's trade for ___"" posts, there is always an ignorance (as in ""ignore"", not stupidity) of costs.  The act is that right now there are some very exciting prospects coming up, guys who may someday end up the faces of the organization.  If the Yankees were to make any moves for someone big, they're going to have to part with Severino or Judge or both.  These posts should not be, ""Let's trade for __"", they should be, ""Wouldn't it be cool to have __"".  Because the way they are now they're always indicative of a fanbase mindset that disregards for prospect development and a need to have the instant gratification for the biggest name at the expense of the farm system.  The result is an organization that is entirely depleted of young talent and entirely topheavy with aging players on contract for a very long time.  And don't even get me started on the fact that with these big fat contracts, many of the times we do actually have some promising talent coming out of the minor leagues, we have no place to put them because we have contract obligations (if only in sentiment) to play guys with big fat contracts who are not producing."
NYYankees,3dvepl,PyreDruid,0,Mon Jul 20 02:57:52 2015 UTC,"It was a knee jerk reaction post. I heard he's on the market, and I happen to be a Kimbrel fan.  My fam transplanted to the south when I was younger, so I took on the Braves as my second team. I loved the McCann signing, and just want Kimbrel for that reason. It's just cause I'm a fan boy.  Should have said ""It would be cool if...""  Lots of folks are beating a dead horse."
NYYankees,3dvepl,Jrodkin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:16:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry for beating on your post like that.  It's not an odd thing to want to chase after a sale.  I hope you're not dissuaded from posting again after so many people are coming down so hard on what was a perfectly fine flight of fancy.  I think what most people are responding to is a dreaded mindset among our fanbase in general, which is the chasing of big names in exchange for the hemorrhaging of prospects.  A lot of us feel like that's how we ended up with a lot of the problems we have today.  We've seen a lot of Yankee teams since about 2000 (give or take a few years)  that have been gradually more saturated with sellswords rather than homegrown talent.  In those days, we at least had the core 4 (5 if you count Bernie, which I do) to fall back on, but as they retired, they weren't replaced with Yankee prospects, but with big name free agents and trades.  And this year, after the departures of Jeter and Mariano, there isn't that foundation anymore of organic Yankee talent.  The two main guys are Gardner and Betances, who are incredible, but not enough to maintain fan morale.  It feels almost like the Yankees have lost their soul.  I know I personally am really looking forward to seeing if any of this new school of prospects, prospects that the organization is wisely cultivating rather than jettisoning, become a significant part of  the Yankees' future, and in turn Yankee history.  The Yankees were so close to trading Jeter and Mariano to the Tigers.  Just think about how much different the past 20 years would have been for us fans if that had happened."
NYYankees,3dvepl,Irreversible_Rape,2,Mon Jul 20 03:45:07 2015 UTC,"It's all good. I had a knee jerk reaction, I should expect knee jerk results.  It would be nice to hold onto a guy, and have him become the next home bred Yankee. There are just so many prospects, and too many times have I hear these guys fizzle out. Wouldn't it be nice, though, to have someone like Trout or Harper who are super young, and just insanely talented. Those guys are lifers.  The problem is that they are just so hard to come by. Those are generational talents. I know Miller and Betances have been lights out, but I'm of the mindset that Kimbrel can consistently be dominant in pinstripes. This is an off year for him, and he is still very solid."

Cadillacing into first on a homer, he thought ... ended up thrown out at second.  Did the same thing the next at bat, noticed it might not go out and started running hard only to have it go an inch over the wall.   Guy is very low effort. Obviously. We all know that.

NYYankees,3dp28y,Yankeebot,22,Sat Jul 18 02:18:02 2015 UTC,"I don't care what anyone says,  that was a fine outing from Tanaka. Give the guys a chance to get the lead then hand the ball over to the bullpen. 7IP is perfect for us with Betances and Miller for the 8th and 9th. If we could get that from all our starters we would be golden for the rest of the season."
NYYankees,3dp28y,kgolfer2012,8,Sat Jul 18 02:29:07 2015 UTC,I thought he was great. 7 base runners in 7 innings.  Only two XBH were Seagers homers. Sometimes you just run into a hot hitter.  7 Ks.  Splitter was nasty. One of the two walks should have been a called strikeout.
NYYankees,3dp28y,DuckingShot,6,Sat Jul 18 03:04:44 2015 UTC,Not to mention if he was actually needed he could've easily gone back out there if either was unavailable.

NYYankees,3dp28y,mt14,9,Sat Jul 18 02:38:04 2015 UTC,"It felt great to have baseball back after a few days of absence! Tonight was a great win for the Yankees. Say what you will about Tanaka but aside from the 2 HRs from Seager, Tanaka put up a great pitching performance. Yankees offense continues to shine with Young, Headley, McCann, and A-Rod showing up. Yankees now have a four game winning streak against the Mariners this season. Can't wait for some baseball tomorrow afternoon!"

NYYankees,3dp28y,SonofJersey,5,Sun Jul 19 01:55:32 2015 UTC,Any expectations for the trade deadline as of now?
NYYankees,3dp28y,ajwhite98,2,Sat Jul 18 02:53:12 2015 UTC,"It's not an ""expectation"" but I want us to call the Padres about Kimbrel if they want to dump salary. Usually teams in that position will take lesser prospects to shed $$$.   If, and only if, we can get Kimbrel without getting rid of Judge/Severino/Mateo, I'd be very interested in that deal.   Our bullpen would be insane. Shreve, Wilson, Betances, Kimbrel, Miller....good gracious"
NYYankees,3dp28y,rkwittem,7,Sat Jul 18 03:47:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people have been so in love with Kimbrel and Chapman. Closer is literally the single thing we need least, why would we give up anything to shore up the back of the bullpen?"
NYYankees,3dp28y,snoharm,3,Sat Jul 18 05:08:35 2015 UTC,"I think the idea is that we give up very little and basically take on a lot of salary in exchange -- something the Yankees are in a perfect position to do. Miller's injury showed us that nobody is impermeable. There is no such thing as too much bullpen depth, and if a mid-level prospect is what we give up to grab a guy like Kimbrel, we could have a bullpen like the Royals for a couple of years.  However, it would absolutely have to be a mid-level guy. It's a long shot and hardly a priority, but one can dream."

NYYankees,3do31q,IAmTheLorax420,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:04:54 2015 UTC,"I posted something like this a month or two ago and got a response that made me rethink us making a big trade. Who gets bumped from the rotation? Eovaldi? He's being bred as a starter for years to come? CC? Fingers fucking crossed. Severino would prob be in the bullpen which is a waste for him, and unfortunately Judge would need to supplant Beltran/Young/Jones, which is just as difficult as supplanting CC. If only if only"
NYYankees,3do31q,omgitsduaner,3,Sat Jul 18 17:03:55 2015 UTC,"I think Leake is a very good pitcher, and he could do very well on any given team that he gets traded to, but I don't think yankee stadium will do him any good.  As for Cueto, given the year he's having his asking price will probably be very high, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable giving up one or two of our very good prospects for him.  EDIT: to add, I don't really think we need to add a pitcher. While obviously, you can never have enough starting pitching, we aren't in the same position at the beginning of the year where we absolutely NEED a pitcher, we're in a pretty good spot right now where we shouldn't be panicking and as a result selling our future and gutting our farm system for a rental."
NYYankees,3do31q,yanksin1st,2,Fri Jul 17 23:25:45 2015 UTC,Issue with Leake is his FIP is high as hell right now and moving from NL to AL usually causes that to jump (though NL Central has decent offenses so it might not be as drastic).  I'd wait and see on Cueto. Price probably will be too high but it depends on who goes after Hamels/A's pitchers/Sale?
NYYankees,3do31q,homemade_mayo,2,Fri Jul 17 21:55:03 2015 UTC,I don't think sale will go anywhere. But I agree that the bidding between Hamels and Cueto will be interesting.
NYYankees,3do31q,m0therrussian,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:10:02 2015 UTC,"Yea, Sale is not moving, no chance of that."
NYYankees,3do31q,KwanzaaSanta,2,Sat Jul 18 04:16:57 2015 UTC,"Leake's ERA and FIP are within a few points of each other.  If anything, his xFIP is promising at 3.57, though he won't get much help from Yankee Stadium.  His FIP is hurt by him playing in Cincy"
NYYankees,3do31q,homemade_mayo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:37:45 2015 UTC,"I just went by FIP as a replacement for ERA, didn't mean that I expected regression of any kind.  His xFIP is slightly promising and I wouldn't be upset if he was our #5 but he isn't worth giving up a prospect of any value, IMO."
NYYankees,3do31q,KwanzaaSanta,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:39:11 2015 UTC,"He's the perfect example of the market dictating the price.  He'd almost definitely accept a QO so Cincy probably won't extend one.  This eliminates the possibility of a draft pick.  So it becomes a take what you can get scenario.  If everybody is offering B prospects, a B+ would get him.    Unless they lock him up long term, there's zero chance they don't move him"
NYYankees,3do31q,homemade_mayo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:41:20 2015 UTC,If there are multiple suitors I could see him getting better than a B+ prospect. It happens all the time. I could also see them trying to package Leake/Cueto in a deal for +++ prospects a la Cubs-A's
NYYankees,3do31q,KwanzaaSanta,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:52:38 2015 UTC,I honestly don't know who would pay the price for the combo.  Maybe the Sox?  I can't think of anyone else
NYYankees,3do31q,homemade_mayo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:05:46 2015 UTC,Yeah they're who I had in mind
NYYankees,3do31q,PeyoteHero,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:53:02 2015 UTC,He'd almost definitely accept a QO so Cincy probably won't extend one.   I'm not as sure as you about that.  I think he could get more as a FA than what the qualifying offer should be.  He's good enough that a team will give him a multiple year offer.
NYYankees,3do31q,KwanzaaSanta,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:36:04 2015 UTC,"Isn't QO gonna approach $16MM+ this year?  He could accept that then get almost the same deal he'd get this year the next year lol he's only 27.   If I were him I'd accept a QO, make $16MM for a year, then hit FA at 28 and get a solid deal at a #3"
NYYankees,3do31q,PeyoteHero,2,Sat Jul 18 01:39:10 2015 UTC,It could be that high I'm not sure.  But why wait a year and risk an injury or a really bad season which tanks your value when you could get a Brandon McCarthy type of contract right now?  Personally I'd take the gamble that a team would give me that kind of deal and decline the offer.
NYYankees,3do31q,rkwittem,2,Sat Jul 18 01:44:08 2015 UTC,"The Yankees would be better suited to talking with teams that are looking to shed payroll and might take a discounted rate of return to do so.   If the Padres are shopping some of their key guys, I'd call them. Imagine Kimbrel in our bullpen."

NYYankees,3do31q,Pillsy74,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:42:13 2015 UTC,"Samar.... on the ChiSox could be an interesting choice as well.  Heyman says that he's more likely to be up than Sale.  While I'd love to get Cueto, we'd likely have to give up Judge, as Bruce is likely going to go, too (perfect fit for the Angels).  If one of these guys can be had without giving up Severino or Judge, that's a win."
NYYankees,3do31q,ajwhite98,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:22:34 2015 UTC,"I'd like to keep Bird and Ref, too, if possible, but they'd be must-haves in a big name trade if Severino and Judge are off-limits."
NYYankees,3do31q,Pillsy74,2,Fri Jul 17 22:26:00 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I think Ref was up to be showcased.  However, Cincy may not be a great fit because of Brandon Phillips."
NYYankees,3do31q,Upuser,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:30:46 2015 UTC,"Brandon Phillips   He has two years left on his contract at $13M and $14M, I think they will try to move him for prospects and to unload that contract."
NYYankees,3do31q,Pillsy74,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:44:26 2015 UTC,"Also possible he'd be a throw in if a team like the Yanks was willing to take his contract.  That being said, he's a great defensive 2B and has an amazing clubhouse presence.  He's also 34, so I don't know what they could necessarily get for him."
NYYankees,3do31q,PacinosWig,2,Fri Jul 17 23:52:02 2015 UTC,amazing clubhouse presence.    I thought I read the opposite when people were talking about trading Gardner for him after Cano went to the M's.
NYYankees,3do31q,PeyoteHero,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:14:23 2015 UTC,I'm not averse to picking up any player and that includes Cueto and Leake.  As long as the price needed to acquire them is reasonable.  That's the key.
NYYankees,3do31q,MartMillz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:33:12 2015 UTC,"I imagine any trade would involve Nova and/or his rotation spot and I don't think Leake is that much better than Nova or Warren to make an impact.  Cueto could certainly help win us a World Series... I would hate to lose Nova for half a season of Cueto, but I do think Cueto would re-sign, although I don't know if the Yankees will want to fork out the $200 million he will demand."
NYYankees,3do31q,shantm79,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:46:32 2015 UTC,"Cueto has had shoulder problems, stay away."

NYYankees,3do31q,poppymelt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:43:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think Leake would pitch better than Warren, so there is no reason to trade for him.  Cueto would be great but we(ownership) don't want to do anything with our pitching, we would have to give up Nova or Eovaldi in the deal."
NYYankees,3do31q,PacinosWig,2,Fri Jul 17 22:38:07 2015 UTC,If we could lock Cueto into an extension before we traded for him I would give up Nova or Eovaldi. That would be a massive upgrade.
NYYankees,3do31q,MartMillz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:15:37 2015 UTC,I think Cueto would look to test the open market unless the Yankees cough up the $200 million he pretty much deserves.
NYYankees,3do31q,PacinosWig,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:55:01 2015 UTC,I wouldn't give him 200 million but I'd do 6/168.
NYYankees,3do31q,MartMillz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:57:31 2015 UTC,If like to think he would take more money and less years but he's said he wants Scherzer money and his numbers do put him in line with other elite starters getting those contracts.
NYYankees,3do31q,Son_Of_Jameson,-2,Sat Jul 18 18:38:45 2015 UTC,"Cueto won't be able to handle NY. If we absolutely need a pitcher for next year, it will be David Price."
NYYankees,3do31q,turnvknup,2,Fri Jul 17 23:13:35 2015 UTC,David Price in pinstripes...drools
NYYankees,3do31q,MartMillz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:17:31 2015 UTC,Cueto won't be able to handle NY   That's ridiculous speculation based off nothing. Cueto is a gamer.

NYYankees,3denyg,viewless25,2,Wed Jul 15 18:24:18 2015 UTC,Now they've signed everyone but a handful of late round guys. Even players that were unlikely they managed to sign (like Rogers).

NYYankees,3denyg,FairEnough,2,Wed Jul 15 18:57:23 2015 UTC,"Noice.  CC is signed through 2016, and I highly doubt he gets resigned unless he manages to really pick up his game.  Severino should be up and ready by then.  Might be a bit crowded, but not really a bad problem to have, unless we send someone to the bullpen like we did with Warren."
NYYankees,3denyg,rkwittem,4,Wed Jul 15 19:03:12 2015 UTC,"For sure not this year. Just because they said he's the most MLB ready, doesn't mean he's actually ready. It mostly referred to the fact that he has a four-pitch mix, whereas a lot of pitching prospects only have maybe 2 plus pitches, and need some time in the minors to develop an additional one or two."

NYYankees,3deqbg,Upuser,8,Wed Jul 15 18:17:35 2015 UTC,"Just my thoughts as I go, first time actually seeing this sort of thing-  1) Wow.  Calling Tanaka ""Still a solid No. 2/3 starter.""  Bold.  Tanaka may not look amazing right now, but we've seen what he can do.  If he finds his stride, he'll be unquestionably the ace of our staff.  For now, though, he and Pineda are both really just #2 starters sharing the job of the #1.  2) Think ESPN is being a little harsh on Eovaldi.  Despite his shortcomings, we win when he is on the mound, and in the end that's all that counts.  3) How the hell is CC at a D+ and Cap at a D?  Capuano's contract is on Cashman, not Cap.  He's done much better as a MRP than as a starter, and regardless he's done better than CC.  Starting to think these are bullshit.  4) Wow.  Knocking Miller to an A- because he got injured.  That's just dumb.  Also, Shreve at the same grade?  Shreve is great, but he is not on Miller's level.  Very few are.  5) Shit, Wilson's at an A-, too?  Love the guy, he's done amazing, but he really is not on Miller's level.  6) Why is Rogers even still on this?  7) The fact that Pirela is rated above Drew and Jones above Headley is frankly insulting and proves that this is bullshit.  All in all, a nice read, a nice recap of the first half, and a decent evaluation of most of the team.  I'm not sure if there's some bias against certain guys or if the writer/grader doesn't really know what he's talking about when it comes to certain parts of the game.  Thanks for the read, though, OP, anything to get through the break."
NYYankees,3deqbg,ajwhite98,2,Wed Jul 15 18:50:45 2015 UTC,"Yea, the tanaka thing had me shaking my head, a #3 ?  Really ?"
NYYankees,3deqbg,m0therrussian,2,Wed Jul 15 22:57:33 2015 UTC,"The wins have little to do with Eovaldi, he gets 7 per on average, if you can't rack up wins with that type of support than you don't belong in the MLB"
NYYankees,3deqbg,cracked6,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:59:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but we don't seem to do that with other pitchers on the mound.  We get into nailbiters.  As long as we hit for Eovaldi, he'll get the W, and he'll deserve his spot in the rotation."
NYYankees,3deqbg,ajwhite98,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:28:28 2015 UTC,"Lol the hitting has nothing to do with whos on the mound. The Yankees don't have many better options at a 4 SP so he'll stay in, but it's not like he is exactly blowing anyone away."
NYYankees,3deqbg,cracked6,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:44:36 2015 UTC,"You'd think the hitting has nothing to do with who's pitching, but Eovaldi has time and time again gotten lit up on the mound yet earned a win or hold because we scored a shit ton of runs for him.  Doesn't that at least suggest that the team is more comfortable hitting when Evo is on the mound?  There's a lot of small things that can affect the game in a big way.  For all we know, Evo could just have a personality that the team finds agreeable, and are thus more relaxed at the plate.  Or maybe he's dying to win, and they play their absolute best for him.  We don't know.  But you simply cannot deny that we have scored more runs for Eovaldi than we have for anyone else."
NYYankees,3deqbg,ajwhite98,3,Wed Jul 15 23:50:13 2015 UTC,"That is like saying who wins the subways race on the board at the stadium affects how the offense is gonna play. Use something else to defend Eovaldi besides his ""magic"" that he has on a totally unrelated part of the game."
NYYankees,3deqbg,cracked6,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:52:37 2015 UTC,"Look, the fact of it is that we tend to score and win when Eovaldi is on the mound.  And as you so kindly pointed out, he's not actually that great of a pitcher.  He's our 5th best starter, counting Warren.  So why, in your opinion, do we win when he pitches?"

Also we should offer to eat 2.64% of Beltran's salary. Solid deal."

NYYankees,3dadb0,Wipeout17,23,Tue Jul 14 19:07:51 2015 UTC,"Damn fucking right. If there is any way to start a true Yankee legacy, it's hitting your second MLB hit over the green monster. Can't wait to see how this kid plays out."
NYYankees,3dadb0,Qui-Bong,11,Tue Jul 14 19:11:17 2015 UTC,More REF-Y Bombs are coming!
NYYankees,3dadb0,Colossal89,5,Tue Jul 14 21:01:24 2015 UTC,Oh holy shit all the Rafi jokes we can make.  Jason Mantzoukis confirmed for George's best friend.
NYYankees,3dadb0,snoharm,16,Tue Jul 14 21:19:18 2015 UTC,"Any idea to the contrary would make me question this team's management.  Keep Drew as a utility infielder -- the plus glove and extra pop in his bat (despite the average) makes the bench stronger than keeping the random assortment of infielders we've had there. Suddenly, you got a stew going!"
NYYankees,3dadb0,TheNightlightZone,8,Tue Jul 14 20:02:37 2015 UTC,"And the bottom of the order won't be a wasteland anymore, especially with Didi hitting better as well."
NYYankees,3dadb0,mjst0324,3,Tue Jul 14 20:23:49 2015 UTC,I would be stunned if they weren't committed to this when they called him up.  I'm guessing that Girardi wanted to talk to some of the other guys before making it public.
NYYankees,3dadb0,hector92,-15,Tue Jul 14 23:09:39 2015 UTC,"Drew would be an awful bench player.  His bat is so bad that he should never get a chance to hit.  His glove is at best average at 2nd and maybe slightly above average at SS. We have Brendan Ryan or can get many other cheap MI with much better gloves.  He can't run the bases, he is completely useless as a pinch runner."
NYYankees,3dadb0,poppymelt,17,Tue Jul 14 20:38:21 2015 UTC,Solid defender with power?  That's a pretty good bench player.
NYYankees,3dadb0,snoharm,-8,Tue Jul 14 21:20:06 2015 UTC,Average defender and he doesn't have real power. His HRs are all on fastballs down the middle because nobody wants to walk him.
NYYankees,3dadb0,poppymelt,7,Tue Jul 14 22:46:03 2015 UTC,"His baseball IQ is off the charts, and ability to be a fast learner, gifted defender, and head down team guy is unquestionable.    Sure, he is average defender at 2B ... after about 10 lifetime games there before this year. Solid at 3B playing it for the first time in his life last year. An MLB elite level SS, objectively better at SS defense an game IQ than our starter (who hits better though).   As a bonus, has the second most HR in baseball. Hits to gaps for doubles when he makes contact well.   Drew as a backup goes from a headache to a massive help."
NYYankees,3dadb0,rightc0ast,-2,Wed Jul 15 14:08:39 2015 UTC,"head down team guy is unquestionable.   If you are hitting like him and aren't bunting against the shift or to move runners over then i don't think he is a good team guy.   Sure, he is average defender at 2B ... after about 10 lifetime games there before this year.   Doesn't change the fact he isn't worth anything   As a bonus, has the second most HR in baseball   Not even close"
NYYankees,3dadb0,poppymelt,3,Wed Jul 15 17:31:09 2015 UTC,"He (almost certainly) is given signs, and given the bunt for singles sign.   I meant for a second baseman, regarding home runs."
NYYankees,3dadb0,rightc0ast,8,Wed Jul 15 17:38:53 2015 UTC,"Drew is a significantly better hitter than Ryan and any other cheap MI.  I'd say he's also better than average at second, but it's not really a big deal.  I think he's clearly above the other options (Ryan and Petit) and don't understand all the DFA talk."
NYYankees,3dadb0,hector92,4,Tue Jul 14 23:16:12 2015 UTC,"I think he's going to better than the scouts give him credit for.  He seems to have good at bats...takes a lot of pitches, hasn't struck out yet.  He hits line drives, uses the whole field and has speed - so he'll beat out infield hits."
NYYankees,3dadb0,DuckingShot,3,Tue Jul 14 20:20:28 2015 UTC,"Unsurprising, yet gratifying.  Ref should be a big boost to our bats for the rest of the season.  I'm willing to bet that Petit will be the one to leave the 40 man roster, while Drew and Ryan will stick around as backups."
NYYankees,3dadb0,ajwhite98,3,Tue Jul 14 20:42:31 2015 UTC,"Wait until the wind shifts, then Ryan will be back on the DL."
NYYankees,3dadb0,brokenarrow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:49:18 2015 UTC,"They probably do that for a while, but I think there's better options for the 25th spot.  Barring injury there's just not much reason for Ryan to play.  He's probably marginally better than Drew against lefties and therefore would be a better option to give Didi and Headley days off.  Those guys combine for what like 10 games off the rest of the way, though?  I don't think it's worth it."
NYYankees,3dadb0,hector92,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:26:09 2015 UTC,"Drew has actually hit a lot better against lefties than against righties this season.  But I see your point.  Knowing this team, though, I think Drew will be the one to stick around.  Ryan will probably stay with the team, though not necessarily on the 25 man.  People were joking a while back that Ryan might've agreed to go on ""DL"" stints when the Yanks needed a roster spot, and if it happens again it might not seem so crazy.  Maybe Ryan is just that guy that we know we can drop if we need the spot but will keep around just for shits and giggles.  I definitely don't think we need both Drew and Ryan, or even want both of them, but it just feels like that's how it's going to play out."
NYYankees,3dadb0,ajwhite98,2,Wed Jul 15 00:20:40 2015 UTC,"oh yeah if I wasn't clear, I want Drew to stick around and think he's good for that role.  The both of them will annoy the hell out of me."
NYYankees,3dadb0,hector92,2,Wed Jul 15 00:32:11 2015 UTC,Article is wrong at the end. He went 0-3 and then 2-4.
NYYankees,3dadb0,phspong,2,Wed Jul 15 00:09:47 2015 UTC,Any chance of some Refsnyder flair?
NYYankees,3dadb0,Cyril_Clunge,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:21:56 2015 UTC,Will he bat 8th and Didi 9th?
NYYankees,3dadb0,ConorJay25,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:38:56 2015 UTC,Sooooo....can we get a flair for The Ref? I want one. Been wanting him to come up since ST.
NYYankees,3dadb0,jfiend13,-5,Thu Jul 16 22:01:34 2015 UTC,Thank god for some common sense
NYYankees,3dadb0,Irreversible_Rape,18,Tue Jul 14 20:34:11 2015 UTC,"Because you are just the king of common sense, right?"
NYYankees,3dadb0,TheGoMLStick,-14,Wed Jul 15 01:07:47 2015 UTC,What would be common sense to you. Sending Ref down and keep Drew starting?
NYYankees,3dadb0,Irreversible_Rape,-2,Wed Jul 15 01:09:15 2015 UTC,Trade for a legitimate 2nd baseman and let Ref learn on the go from a backup role? We can't win a title with him as the main 2nd baseman.
NYYankees,3dadb0,TheGoMLStick,2,Wed Jul 15 03:41:29 2015 UTC,"He's only played 2 games and has shown competency at 2B, It hasn't been enough time to know if his defense is a liability or not. this teams biggest problem has been not developing talent through our minors and this kid is showing you great things at the plate. Now you want to trade for 2B?  WHo you giving up?"
NYYankees,3dadb0,Irreversible_Rape,2,Wed Jul 15 03:48:09 2015 UTC,"Dude. Ref is a nice piece and all, but we all know his defense is not great. He's going to make mistakes. Probably more than a few. You ripped Headley and Gregorious for shitty defense. There are guys like Prado or Phillips who could take over as legit 2nd baseman."
NYYankees,3dadb0,TheGoMLStick,-2,Wed Jul 15 04:02:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, you want to send Ref back down I got it. Just don't be hopping on that hype train this year"
NYYankees,3dadb0,Irreversible_Rape,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:05:03 2015 UTC,Didn't you just see what I said? Trade for a legit 2nd baseman and let Ref learn on the fly... Don't tell me who to route for. It would be the same as me telling you to not route for half the team because of shit you've said.
NYYankees,3dadb0,TheGoMLStick,-1,Wed Jul 15 04:09:56 2015 UTC,"How would Ref learn on the fly if he doesn't play?  Drew can play backup 2B fine, no need to trade and give up anything in the farm"
NYYankees,3dadb0,Irreversible_Rape,-1,Wed Jul 15 04:16:14 2015 UTC,"You just don't realize what this team needs to WIN, do you? He can learn on the majors without starting perfectly fine. I really don't want to keep arguing with you because you seem to be in you're on little world so there's just no point."
