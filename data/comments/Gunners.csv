Gunners,3e37yg,LouboAsyky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:50 2015 UTC,Well last year they had Rooney and RVP on their books and still went out and got Falcao on loan. I think Van Gaal wants another top quality striker.

At least not with Benzema who, age-wise, is in the earlier parts of his prime, and does not at all seem the type to sacrifice playing time to get paid money at a club that is still re-building and not already established as domestic title challengers. And I don't think it is about money with him. That is the only thing United has to offer better than us.   If they are getting somebody top-quality, it will be the Falcao type. Not a Benzema or a Reus."

Gunners,3e37yg,bellend1234,11,Tue Jul 21 16:47:00 2015 UTC,Not sure I trust GFF any more. Can't remember them explicitly getting something right recently.  Even the Ospina scoop they reported last year was taken from a local newspaper in Nice.  Edit: But this is just them relaying a message from someone else.
Gunners,3e37yg,Spitzee,19,Tue Jul 21 16:58:51 2015 UTC,"I actually worked for GFFN last summer as an intern. Their sources are usually screened once the information is gathered by their team (I was working on South American news for them). Whilst it is not always true, they try their best to make sure their sources have some validity about them.      edit  So for those who are curious, when I started working there, the first couple of weeks were spent doing research into the specific locations publications, websites and journalists (I was focused on Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Venezuela). In doing so we looked at their past publications and then came up with a list of the ones we believed to be the most reliable and/or are the first to break news. Just based on that, the information that was used on the site and posted on Twitter usually does have something about it. Now I can't comment on Benzema as I have no ties to GFFN anymore but my bet would be that there is something there."

Gunners,3e37yg,TrevTrev4Ev,3,Tue Jul 21 17:06:24 2015 UTC,"Still, it doesn't make much sense. Why would you not trust a news aggregator because they haven't scooped a story, when that's not what they claim to do or what their purpose is?"
Gunners,3e37yg,bellend1234,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:12:29 2015 UTC,"I don't trust what they aggregate because I haven't seen them get (aggregate) anything right. The only exception I can think of is the Ospina deal, which, coming from a Nice newspaper and already posted here at the time, was well-known."
Gunners,3e37yg,TrevTrev4Ev,2,Tue Jul 21 17:19:58 2015 UTC,"Well most transfer news doesn't end up coming to fruition, in general. This particular story sounds promising as it's being reported by a very reliable journalist."

Gunners,3e37yg,TrevTrev4Ev,3,Tue Jul 21 17:38:48 2015 UTC,The story itself (that Wenger has contacted Benzema's reps and expressed interest) is probably accurate. Whether that means we actually end up signing him is entirely different.

Gunners,3e37yg,Funkyfreshprince,4,Tue Jul 21 16:57:48 2015 UTC,Yeah even if this is true there's a big difference between being interested in Benzema and Perez actually giving one of his favourite toys over.
Gunners,3e37yg,ZXXA,9,Tue Jul 21 16:59:17 2015 UTC,"Ofcouse there is, But this atleast somewhat confirms that we are indeed interested in him and with How highly regarded Arsene wenger is in the france community and around the world....you never know. And we all know wenger, he will never try and sign a player if he thinks its not possible. He always looks at the bigger picture"
Gunners,3e37yg,Funkyfreshprince,0,Tue Jul 21 17:04:02 2015 UTC,"We would've always been interested in Benzema. What team without world class strikers and the capacity to finance them wouldn't be interested in Karim Benzema? Wenger and Benzema being French is irrelevant if Benz isn't first shifted out of the starting XI of Real Madrid because he loves it there and let's be honest, he's not going to trade starting for Real for starting with Arsenal. I back us to get him if he's dropped to the bench regardless of what his country of origin is."

They're not reachable and not possible thats why. Arsenal are only interested in players who they think they could get or else why even bother ? Benitez is playing Ronaldo up top this season according to MANY reports. This puts Benzema on the bench a he won't start over Ronaldo. And french is not irrelevant, ask any players that came from the french league, they all look up to him."

Gunners,3e37yg,It_was_too_Obvious,3,Tue Jul 21 18:50:37 2015 UTC,"Dude look at it this way.  Wenger probably has better connections into finding out what's really going on at Real, probably much better than all of us.  So when he tells Benzema that he wants him at Arsenal and is prepared to move for him, he's essentially putting an option on table for Benzema to think about it - because Wenger knows that there is a slight chance Benzema would intend to leave.  Also it's Real, you never can make sense of what they do."

Gunners,3e37yg,DevilsLittleChicken,2,Tue Jul 21 17:50:01 2015 UTC,or maybe we have been interested in benzema all that time? Wenger has been trying to upgrade Giroud since the summer after giroud got here

Gunners,3e37yg,vinnienine,5,Tue Jul 21 17:37:27 2015 UTC,"I have no doubt that Wenger would be interested in buying Benzema. I also have no doubt that Real has no interest in selling him, UNLESS the rumors about Cristiano playing CF are true.  If Ronaldo is going to Striker, then the rumors about Llorente to Real make sense since he'd be a good backup/plan B player, and Benzema is rather likely to want a move. I suspect everything will be a little clearer once the season gets underway, I doubt we will wrap this up quickly if it even happens.   Edit: Apparently Madrid is after Reus as well, which seems possible and I can see them overpaying for him by a decent margin. If so I think they'd line up with a front three of Bale-Ronaldo-Reus, a midfield 3 of Kroos, Modric, and James, and depth in the form of Isco, Illara, Llorente, and Lucas Silva. Isco, James and Ronaldo can play on the wing, Llorente as cover up top with Jese as 3rd string, and a couple options in the midfield. If this was the lineup I'd expect Benzema to want a move, and I don't think Real could be too upset as this is a terrifying squad."
Gunners,3e37yg,Pepperkeanen,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:23 2015 UTC,"I reckon Real will get Reus, but keep Benzema. He'll find game time limited, and by January will be looking for a move. That won't happen either though as they won't want to sell mid season (big clubs rarely do), and he'll move next summer. By which time they'll have a new Galactico signing lined up to placate fans. This is what will happen. Arsenal will be an option for him but he'll have his pick."

Gunners,3e37yg,imperat0r_,4,Tue Jul 21 17:38:44 2015 UTC,"LVG already publicly proclaimed Rooney will be the main striker which implies that anyone coming in is second fiddle.  Chelsea will play with Costa as the main striker. You don't even have to ask to know that Mou prefers his big, tall strong, lone strikers a la Droga  Aguero is undoubtedly City's #1 striker and as long as he's fit, he's the first one on the team sheet.  We can speculate Giroud as being a starter but Wenger hasn't really said anything about that so Benzema could and being French and having our French contingent could appeal to Benzema. Wenger allegedly personally calling Benzema could also show that he would be an important part of the team - Arsene seems to be able to persuade people into becoming interested in joining."

Right now they are thin at the central striker position and they love Benz, so there isn't much reason to sell :-/  there's a lot of time left in the transfer window though, so anything can happen"
Gunners,3e37yg,USGOONER1,2,Tue Jul 21 18:02:11 2015 UTC,Do you think this type of signing will dent moral for Theo? After all he wants to be the main striker.
Gunners,3e37yg,rakiispathetic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:30:09 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting question. My thoughts are that IF we sign Benzema, he is generally amazing at supplying other attackers with assists and link up play. I would think that Walcott would remain 1st choice on the right and would therefore be in a position to increase his goal tally.

Gunners,3e37yg,John_Manhunter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:49:02 2015 UTC,No idea who this mohamed bloke is. Even if this is legit in the case of Karim Benzema there is a massive difference between Arsene being interested and being able to actually sign the guy considering the circumstance he finds himself in. Benzema will only be allowed to leave if one of Bale or Ronaldo becomes full time striker and they have signed their world class marquee player of the Summer such as Reus. A long way to go even if these rumours are true at all.

Gunners,3e34y0,TweetsInCommentsBot,38,Tue Jul 21 17:08:18 2015 UTC,I'd be very surprised by this. Should be a loan deal not a transfer. He's a youth product and still has a future.
Gunners,3e34y0,interstellar1990,5,Tue Jul 21 16:28:28 2015 UTC,the rumor is 2 year loan with an option to purchase
Gunners,3e34y0,zaviex,12,Tue Jul 21 16:41:22 2015 UTC,"A loan makes no sense to me. If the club still have faith that he could develop into a player for the future, why loan him? He's already got loads of first team top flight experience so he doesn't really need an opportunity in that sense, and meanwhile the club now have - for really the first time for him - a mentor that could really help to develop him. Playing at Roma won't necessarily grow him up, but working with Cech could really have some influence.   IMO if the club have faith in him and he's willing to learn, they should keep him in the squad with Cech. If either isn't true (and there have been rumours of both), they need to sell him. That would be the best for both parties."
Gunners,3e34y0,Searocksandtrees,9,Tue Jul 21 16:40:30 2015 UTC,"I agree. One of the many upsides to signing Cech was the influence he'd have on Chez. Attitude or not, the lad has a bigger ceiling and greater potential than Ospina and so I wasn't really arsed about the latter leaving. Be different if it was Woj though, especially if it was on a permanent. Can't let a home-grown, talented lad go. Different matter if he's making a fuss. Nothing much we can do about that. Be a shame."
Gunners,3e34y0,TavNam,3,Tue Jul 21 17:45:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I really like Szczesny as a player, even the crazy stuff he does on pitch. But I have my concerns about him too, and trust that the club knows his character and are making decisions accordingly. Would love to see him become great at Arsenal, but if that's not going to happen, let's all move on"
Gunners,3e34y0,Searocksandtrees,4,Tue Jul 21 17:57:12 2015 UTC,Would also give us a bit of an idea as to how highly Martinez is rated if Chezzers is sent out for good.
Gunners,3e34y0,TavNam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:02:05 2015 UTC,"True enough. If the club give Emi some indication that he's part of their future plans, he could be willing to stick around (he considered a transfer request last summer).   Would of course be even a better sign for him if they cut Ospina too, but I can't see that... unless Szcz/Ospina are on a loan with recall I suppose. Ok, so maybe that's an argument for Arsenal to loan Szczesny rather than sell."
Gunners,3e34y0,Searocksandtrees,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:00 2015 UTC,"Woj is 25, why does anyone think he is going to learn from a mentor or feel the need to take lessons? Guy was Poland's #1 and Arsenal's, not many people would take a backseat and simply say ""okay, I'll learn from this chap."""
Gunners,3e34y0,MrAlmostWrong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:13 2015 UTC,Szczesny has no attitude problems. He isn't overconfident and doesn't refuse to train or question Wenger. He lacks concentration and elite ability.
Gunners,3e34y0,HerbertChapmansGhost,3,Tue Jul 21 18:54:38 2015 UTC,because he'll actually play. That's why.  Why did we loan Jenko to West Ham back to back years? So he'll play.
Gunners,3e34y0,islander1,2,Tue Jul 21 18:32:37 2015 UTC,"Completely different situation.   Jenkinson needed to develop, to get the game time yes, but to actually get experience in competition.   Szczesny already has lots of that, and while no one wants him to go stale (maybe he'd play cup ties, and who knows) what he actually needs to develop further is something else: mostly emotional maturity and professionalism. He hasn't been doing very well with that so far. He would have more opportunity to do so under Cech, whereas I doubt he'd be challenged to develop in that way starting elsewhere."
Gunners,3e34y0,Searocksandtrees,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:45 2015 UTC,You make completely valid counterpoints. This is one of those debates where I don't think either side is completely wrong here.
Gunners,3e34y0,islander1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:02 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that Szczesny would likely prefer greater assurance of starting somewhere, just that the club may well have different objectives. In the end none of us know what's going on anyway"
Gunners,3e34y0,Searocksandtrees,2,Tue Jul 21 19:33:24 2015 UTC,Well loaning him out would be a compromise. Wenger inherently prefers to keep his players at the club to develop rather than loan them out. In this case Szczesny probably wouldn't be happy to stay at Arsenal and sit on the bench for another season. So best case for us would be to loan him out and hope he gains some valuable experience at Roma.
Gunners,3e34y0,uselessrightfoot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:52:08 2015 UTC,"Appreciate you answering for the pro-loan side, but I don't understand how this makes sense. Can you flush this out a bit more?   Seems like Arsenal's objective for Szczesny would be that he become their keeper for the future. In that case, he's already loaded with talent, but lacks maturity/professionalism on a few fronts and could improve on decision making, and some technical points. So I suggest that the best way for Szczesny to develop those aspects is under the guidance / coaching / example of a model professional, experienced winner, and technically solid mentor. Cech. Conversely, sending Szczesny to Roma accomplishes none of that (unless there's a particular gk coach or something there?): it's just basically more of the same as he's already been doing. So when he comes back from loan, then what? Have those aspects improved?   From Roma's perspective, I can see how a loan - esp with an option to buy - makes sense, if they have some doubts and essentially want to trial him. But if as rumoured they prefer a transfer, then it sounds like they're already convinced.   From Szczesny's perspective, I can understand him wanting out of Cech's shadow, but not how a loan is more attractive than a transfer... unless he harbours some dream of returning to Arsenal later.  Ultimately all three parties have a say, so we'll see what they decide, but I can't see how Arsenal's best interests are served by a loan vs keep (if they have hopes for him) or sell (if they don't)"
Gunners,3e34y0,Searocksandtrees,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:49 2015 UTC,I understand what you are saying but Szcz has had several years of experience here already. If he goes to Roma it will be permanent

Gunners,3e34y0,rusty-sp00ns,18,Tue Jul 21 19:42:31 2015 UTC,"Guess I'm in the minority but I'll say it - I'd rather keep Ospina. Head is in the right place, just need experience. Has shown he can play at a higher level under pressure - like he did in the Copa America."
Gunners,3e34y0,randy__randerson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:48 2015 UTC,"Ospina + Cech would give us a very strong duo, not sure if Ospina would want bench for the season though.  His value won't go higher if he stays on the bench.  Of course a 2 year loan for Szcez, with Ospina back up is great. Then either Scez returns or Emiliano is ready to be back up and Ospina sold."
Gunners,3e34y0,Pires007,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:34 2015 UTC,See the thing is Ospina didn't come here as the No. 1 either. I realize that the opportunity of competing with Szcz is a lot more promising than being behind Cech but not being a guaranteed starter (and 2nd choice for the first half of the season) means he's somewhat okay with not playing every game. Also Wenger always has his cup keeper so he'll get a decent run at least
Gunners,3e34y0,PurplePride9844,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:20 2015 UTC,Not to mention he's only 26. Not much older than Szczesny.
Gunners,3e34y0,TastyTacoTonight,26,Tue Jul 21 19:46:35 2015 UTC,It better be a fucking loan if anything.
Gunners,3e34y0,hirotoo,13,Tue Jul 21 16:28:42 2015 UTC,How would that change anything? Cech will still be here in a year. We can't keep loaning him out until Cech is too old. He probably got at least 5 years left in him.
Gunners,3e34y0,HAHAHstfu,-12,Tue Jul 21 16:31:03 2015 UTC,I very highly doubt Cech will be our starting keeper in 3 years. Let alone 5.
Gunners,3e34y0,hirotoo,11,Tue Jul 21 16:36:14 2015 UTC,He'll be 36 in three years and has been one of the worlds best for ages. What makes you think he will suddenly decline so rapidly when other great keepers have shown so much longevity?
Gunners,3e34y0,BigTomBombadil,7,Tue Jul 21 16:44:39 2015 UTC,"Just because other GKs have longevity, it doesnt mean the same for Cech. Maybe Szcz will kill it at Roma and will be equal to a declining Cech when he returns in 2 years? Definitely not outside the realms of possibility, similar to courtois and cech i guess, although szcz will be older"
Gunners,3e34y0,gsfw2,4,Tue Jul 21 17:00:58 2015 UTC,This. Just because it happens doesn't mean you can take it for granted. The injury might make him want (or have to) to retire earlier for example
Gunners,3e34y0,Flaminis_sleeves,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:29 2015 UTC,"Sure, I'm just not sure why you're working under the assumption that Cech will be declining then. Goalkeeper longevity typically depends on relying on positioning/fundamentals rather than pure reflexes, and being professional enough to keep and good shape and stay focused. Cech fills both of those boxes.   The only real concern I would have for Cech declining rapidly would be another head injury."
Gunners,3e34y0,BigTomBombadil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not assuming that btw, me and hirotoo are different. I'm just saying its a significant possibility"
Gunners,3e34y0,gsfw2,4,Tue Jul 21 17:10:45 2015 UTC,what makes you doubt that?
Gunners,3e34y0,isaidkneel,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:46 2015 UTC,Didn't he say something about wanting to retire early because of his head injury?
Gunners,3e34y0,call-me-hova,9,Tue Jul 21 17:34:42 2015 UTC,"Why is everyone saying this better be a loan? You expect Cech to be around for 4-5 seasons at least. You think Szcz is going to rot around for that long and then when he is 30 magically reach the pinnacle of goalkeeping that many of you feel he will reach?  I feel like Woj is the only player on the squad that gets massive benefit of the doubt with some of you. Just because some goalkeepers shine after 30 doesn't mean Woj is that type. Why isn't he at the Neuer, Courtois, De Gea, or Lloris level? Keepers under 30 who are world class.  It's not like he hasn't had time to grow. Hell in the last 2 seasons he has been outshined by Fabianski and Ospina.   I'm all for a loan, but if it's a transfer I wouldn't be fussed to be honest. Ospina performed better than Woj and Martinez is going to be a monster. If neither of those two work out then we can buy another world class keeper in 4 years."
Gunners,3e34y0,MrAlmostWrong,0,Tue Jul 21 18:19:36 2015 UTC,"You expect Cech to be around for 4-5 seasons at least.   That might not necessarily be the case. With his head injury, he has talked previously about retiring earlier. He has only played a single game for Arsenal. You don't know how good he'll perform this season let alone manage to stay at this level for another 3 to 4 years or so."
Gunners,3e34y0,Ygqk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:12 2015 UTC,"I think Szcz gets the benefit of the doubt more than many is because we've all seen not just flashes, but sustained stretches of the abilities required to be world class. A large part of why he's not been solidified is the mental aspects, something that regular high-quality game time and age can fix quickly."
Gunners,3e34y0,PurplePride9844,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:13 2015 UTC,"Martinez is the wild card here, imho.  Szczesny gets the benefit of the doubt because he performed very well season before last.  Most people realize he's someone who need stop be pushed, however, or he'll get complacent. With Fabianski breathing down his neck, he played great.  With nobody breathing down his neck last season, he lost his focus and some of his drive."

Gunners,3e34y0,chewkachu,2,Tue Jul 21 16:48:09 2015 UTC,"Hopefully a loan, it would be a shame to sell him. For once Wenger can turn around and say no, even though he is a fair man to his players."

Gunners,3e34y0,Fuckit21,6,Tue Jul 21 16:44:14 2015 UTC,"That's a lot for a keeper, especially one who isn't a sure thing."
Gunners,3e34y0,2rio2,2,Tue Jul 21 16:50:11 2015 UTC,I agree but I feel it would be a negative move for us to sell for anything less.
Gunners,3e34y0,2rio2,2,Tue Jul 21 16:54:24 2015 UTC,"Which is why it'll be a loan. Makes more sense for both parties. Roma has several more important holes to fill this summer and limited money to spend. They're going to invest that into LB and RB and Striker before they spend a dime on keeper. I would imagine Arsenal wants a two year loan while Roma is pushing for one with buy clause at the end of it. They'll probably end up with a two year loan, with option to terminate by either party after one and buy clause if he stays for two."
Gunners,3e34y0,Fuckit21,6,Tue Jul 21 17:21:45 2015 UTC,"You are severely overestimating the market for Szcz right now. He's built a reputation as a physically gifted but mistake prone keeper, with most of those mistakes coming from bad judgement. No one is knocking down our down to buy him. If we did want to sell him, we could do it in the Prem for around 10 mil or so at most, depending on the buyer. Outside the Prem would be closer to 5 or 7 mil."
Gunners,3e34y0,Mackabern,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:19:42 2015 UTC,Im not saying he is worth that much to anyone else. I'm saying that is how much he is worth to us.

I am pretty sure it all comes from that news report that Galatasaray were interested in Flamini and the fee being touted was €4M. They probably didn't even bother converting the fee. Flamini was rumoured as an alternative to Felipe Melo, who decided to stay now. I don't think they will want another DM.

I agree with your statements above, he's world class and I can't see Madrid letting him go without a superior replacement which will be hard to find for Madrid.   If he does sign for Arsenal I'll be happy happy happy."
Gunners,3e2v88,dennisbergkamp10,23,Tue Jul 21 15:18:06 2015 UTC,The only one that I'd like is Lewandowski. He's a better finisher and can pick out a pass pretty well.  He'll be impossible to sign though because Bayern hates our guts.
Gunners,3e2v88,HKAGooner,21,Tue Jul 21 15:23:50 2015 UTC,Aguero would be considered a upgrade right?
Gunners,3e2v88,ImDan1sh,18,Tue Jul 21 15:28:14 2015 UTC,I would say so. Him and Suarez are probably the best two strikers atm.
Gunners,3e2v88,surpeis,2,Tue Jul 21 15:32:10 2015 UTC,"This claim is a bit one dimensional isnt't it?  While I agree they are both amazing strikers, no striker is complete.  For example, they are both useless in the air. This is not only an offensive weakness, but also something that will weaken a team defensively. Giroud is one of our (if not the) most important player defensively on corners and set pieces.  My point is not that Giroud is a better striker than those mentioned. Only that football is a team game, something that is far to often forgotten as media and fans focus more and more on individual skills.   A striker that is a perfect fit for one team might not be what another team needs."
Gunners,3e2v88,weseoj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:18:50 2015 UTC,"That's where I think Suarez has the edge, to say he is useless with his head isn't true in my eyes, he's not like Andy Carroll but he can sure connect with a cross.

Gunners,3e2v88,HerbertChapmansGhost,8,Tue Jul 21 16:01:32 2015 UTC,"Was just looking at your current squad. If you guys do end up signing Reus, a midfield + attack consisting of Modric, Kroos, Reus (left), Bale (right), James (CAM), Ronaldo (striker) would counter attack with devastating efficiency. Benitez likes to play a 4-2-3-1 and loves counter-attacking football. I obviously dont watch as much of Madrid, but if under Benitez, possession drops and counter attacks increase, I can easily see Ronaldo working as a striker."
Gunners,3e2v88,Quilpo,2,Tue Jul 21 15:35:56 2015 UTC,More likely is James on the right and Bale central. They want to build the team around Bale.

The other potential is you guys signing a big time striker, but I don't think there's anyone available that can compare to Benz (or we'd be after them as well!) if he does come I'd be ecstatic, he's world class and would slot in to our style perfectly.   Özil had some struggles his first season with the physicality, and some injury/fatigue troubles at the beginning of this season. However, he seriously bulked up during his time out this fall/winter, and with his first preseason at the club, I expect him to take a step up this season and establish himself as one of the top 3-5 players in the PL.

Giroud, Chamberlain, Welbeck, and Özil (when he shoots which is rare) can be wasteful in front of goal, and it gets frustrating. However, I think that Alexis, Walcott, and Ramsey can all be pretty clinical, and if we can get healthy seasons from those three and Ozil I believe we can challenge Chelsea for the title.   Quick question about Özil, was he as unwilling to shoot for you guys as he was for us his first 1.5 seasons here? He's gotten better at it recently fortunately, but he used to always play the pass even if he had a clear chance."
Gunners,3e2v88,LOLrusty,5,Tue Jul 21 16:07:51 2015 UTC,"Ozil was always pass first, he can shoot well but he's reluctant. Although his last full year at the club in 2012/2013 he managed 9 goals, pretty impressive for him. He didn't have nearly as many assist as he usually had though.   That's why we love James so much right now, he can score goals and assist pretty well. He's still so young but he's growing into a superstar."
Gunners,3e2v88,ZXXA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:27 2015 UTC,"I think Arsenal need to put Özil under hypnosis and convince him that he's not shooting, he's really just trying to make a cheeky pass to the back of the net."
Gunners,3e2v88,isaidkneel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:50:54 2015 UTC,The only big time striker I can think of that would make RM sell Benzema is Kun. And maybe Lewa. But I can't see neither of them leaving their clubs.
Gunners,3e2v88,ZXXA,10,Tue Jul 21 18:16:15 2015 UTC,"At the beginning of summer, I would have agreed with you.  However, the more I've read about Benitez's preferred system, the more I am convinced there may be something to this rumor. Everything I can find about Benitez and the past 2-3 teams he's managed has indicates that he requires a high work-rate from his wingers. Clearly Ronaldo doesn't fit within that framework.   And even though Ronaldo does not like to play as a lone striker, in Benitez's system he could be allowed to play a similar role to his current one: lots of freedom and lots of opportunities on the counter. Just because he'd play as a lone striker doesn't mean he'd have to replicate Benzema's ability to hold up the ball.  I'd still be surprised if Madrid sold Benzema, but not in complete shock. Especially if Madrid by Reus or another top attacking player - certainly Madrid will want to maintain competition in the starting XI so I imagine another near-world class player will be brought in so that Isco, James, & Kroos aren't 100% guaranteed a starting place."
Gunners,3e2v88,Quilpo,12,Tue Jul 21 15:40:01 2015 UTC,Ozil is getting better season by season. Had a knee injury for a significant portion of last season but when he was fit he looked great. Will need to improve his goals and assists this coming season though but he's a crucial element to our side. You miss him when he's gone.  I doubt the Benzema rumours too but I don't doubt that Arsenal are interested in him or would even consider a bid for him. I guess Benitez could shift Bale up top because Perez wants Bale to become star man then Benzema would be left out in the cold or maybe Benitez doesn't really care what Ronaldo thinks and will play him where he wants although I doubt that scenario. I think Madrid may end up signing Reus if Arsenal get Benzema anyway.
Gunners,3e2v88,LOLrusty,3,Tue Jul 21 15:20:26 2015 UTC,"""Will need to improve his goals and assists"". The only reason he ""needs"" to do this, is so people who only look at stats can figure out he's a good player."
Gunners,3e2v88,isaidkneel,6,Tue Jul 21 16:33:13 2015 UTC,He clearly needs to improve his finishing in particular. If you can't see that then you're delusional and looking through rose-tinted glasses.
Gunners,3e2v88,Pires007,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:13 2015 UTC,"i think he was going for the ""you do not have the mental capacity/football knowledge to recognize ozil's contributions"" angle"
Gunners,3e2v88,islander1,2,Tue Jul 21 16:46:43 2015 UTC,Yeah of course he was. What I'm saying is while stats aren't crucial you can see when watching Ozil that he needs to be a little more clinical.
Gunners,3e2v88,bLAZYY,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:25 2015 UTC,"Indeed, hopefully the goal against Everton shows that he's working on it.  If Ozil can become a clinical goalscorer, then there won't be many better players around (fewer than there are now anyway)."
Gunners,3e2v88,Quilpo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:47:38 2015 UTC,"Or I'm going for the angle that 80 percent of /r/soccer is just a circlejerk of stats, any discussion involving players boils down to people linking and talking about stats as a judgement of a players ability, and it's super obvious they barely watch games of the player they are talking about."
Gunners,3e2v88,Guidosama,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:12 2015 UTC,r/soccer isnt inherently relevant here. what you was said the only reason for someone wanting to see improvements in aspects of ozil's play is is because of a misguided reliance on statistics. that is wrong. and its an annoying way to deflect ozil's shortcomings in certain areas.
Gunners,3e2v88,uselessrightfoot,7,Tue Jul 21 17:16:21 2015 UTC,Ozils chance creation stats are insane.  We need to work on finishing
Gunners,3e2v88,saintcazorla,3,Tue Jul 21 16:36:07 2015 UTC,"Ozil's done well when Wenger puts him where he belongs, in the #10 role behind Giroud.  His biggest problem (besides being miscast occasionally by Wenger) has been physically adjusting to the EPL. It's borderline rugby compared to La Liga.   He was incredible after coming back from his injury last season though. He took the opportunity to get physically stronger. Considering he doesn't have Benzema and Ronaldo to work with.    I actually think he and Walcott link up incredibly well, problem is Theo's been out with the ACL and other injuries most of the past two years.  If Theo can stay healthy, I really think he can score 20 with Ozil.  Theo's intelligent runs with blinding speed, and Ozil's preternatural vision and through ball quality. Deadly."
Gunners,3e2v88,Macc14,5,Tue Jul 21 15:37:31 2015 UTC,"Here is to hoping Ozil and Walcott can become a devastating combo, Walcott is so under rated in my opinion he always put them in the net against top teams he pretty much scores every time we play chelsea :P"
Gunners,3e2v88,themanifoldcuriosity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure Theo is under-rated, but I'd back him to get more than a few goals if he can stay fit."

Real Madrid have zero actual #9 strikers. Benzema is the only player who can play up top on his own and actually lead a line. All this talk of Ronaldo moving up top is premature, he has never shown he could play as an effective lone striker."
Gunners,3e2v88,chambo_rambo_chambo,2,Tue Jul 21 16:28:26 2015 UTC,"There clearly is something to the rumors. I don't actually see a logical reason why Real Mad would sell Benzema, but then again you sold Di Maria last season after he had his best season and was undroppable.   What I do know is that Perez really wants to get the best out of Bale, and wants him to be the star of the team. And it is a possibility that in trying to fit in Bale others are sacrificed. Benzema could be one of the casualties.   But despite the interest from Arsenal and the possibility of the move, I dont' see it happening. I think Arsenal are happy enough without signing a striker, and Benzema and Real may be happy enough to stay together for at least another season."
Gunners,3e2v88,Jimbobmij,2,Tue Jul 21 16:48:27 2015 UTC,"Benzema won't be joining Arsenal. Ozil will have an amazing season granted he stays injury free, he was starting to shine at the end of last season."

Gunners,3e2v88,bnfdsl,3,Tue Jul 21 16:02:00 2015 UTC,"Özil has been hot and cold overall (though most of the games he has done poorly, the entire team played poorly), but since he came back from injury in the spring has been pretty consistently great.   I don't think anyone really believes Benzema is coming. But I'd have to be professionally restrained from fits of joy if he did."

It's all a clusterfuck and we are likely going to have wait until next year to get De Gea.  Edit: We don't need De Gea, but Flo cares about Politics and the need to have Spain's #1 in the club."

We have had more incoming youth wise and other back room staff, than we have had outgoing. Remember Jenkinson was on loan last year too, so his impact on our spending power will be minimal (only signing bonus for his contract extension as bulk of wages will be paid by West Ham).  Also, I disagree. We do have a way of estimating how much money we have to spend. There are obviously grey areas, where one has to use his or her judgement, but the lower and upper limits are, in fact, very well defined. Arsenal can afford to spend as much as they have in the bank + how much they have left after covering operating costs.  The critical question isn't how much they can spend, but rather how to spend it."

Gunners,3e0hns,robogator,8,Tue Jul 21 10:53:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly why loan him at this point? Cech should be our number 1 for at least 4 years, that's way too long for a keeper like Szcz to be waiting on the sidelines.  Insert a buyback clause just incase he fulfills his potential and let him go IMO."
Gunners,3e0hns,naryn,18,Tue Jul 21 04:25:50 2015 UTC,Actually I think that a loan is the best move for us. He doesn't gain anything by sitting on the bench for us and the game time there would be beneficial for his development. In theory you are right about Cech but selling Szcz would be stupid because you don't know how he will develop and how is Cech is going to be in a year or two from now. If we sell Szcz and he becomes phenomenal no one guarantees that he would want to come back to Arsenal.
Gunners,3e0hns,robogator,3,Tue Jul 21 04:47:46 2015 UTC,Is Ospina okay on the bench? If he is leaving too then we're down to Martinez as our second if Cech gets injured
Gunners,3e0hns,Flaminis_sleeves,2,Tue Jul 21 08:00:13 2015 UTC,I don't think that both Ospina and Szcz will be leaving but you can never know. Of coarse I would rather that Ospina will be our number two keeper then Martinez.
Gunners,3e0hns,Searocksandtrees,2,Tue Jul 21 12:39:21 2015 UTC,"I think he should stay. He will gain a lot by training with and learning from Chech. He's been our number one for a while now so it's not like he's in desperate need of first team football to develop further. What he needs to develop is in his head, and that's better done at the hands of one of the most experienced and professional keepers in the world, rather than on loan at some random club."
Gunners,3e0hns,sheffers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:37:44 2015 UTC,"Agree: if he's teachable, keep, otherwise sell. A loan makes little sense from the club's perspective"
Gunners,3e0hns,robogator,3,Tue Jul 21 16:23:29 2015 UTC,"Actually I'd say he'd gain more from staying here and learning from Cech. He alreeady has the pysical ability, it's the mental side of his game that he needs to improve on, and being near an ultimate professional like Cech will help him much more."
Gunners,3e0hns,Fgge,3,Tue Jul 21 09:58:50 2015 UTC,"I think that the only way to improve the mental side of his game is by gaining experience. I think that game time will teach him to be level headed and react calmly. I don't think that he can learn that by watching or training witch Cech, it is something you gain after you played enough time and encountered enough situations."
Gunners,3e0hns,NiteNiteSooty,3,Tue Jul 21 12:35:12 2015 UTC,"Why deliberately weaken ourselves? We don't need the cash, and Szcez is a highly promising young keeper. If we can hold onto him we 100% should."
Gunners,3e0hns,Fgge,-7,Tue Jul 21 05:25:42 2015 UTC,is he really that promising? hes 25 and not even close to people like de gae or coutoir and not even close to the top level of goalkeepers in general.
Gunners,3e0hns,bomko,6,Tue Jul 21 10:02:35 2015 UTC,"Let's not judge him off of half a season when the whole defence played like shit. I think he's a very promising player, yeah."
Gunners,3e0hns,NiteNiteSooty,-3,Tue Jul 21 10:08:41 2015 UTC,altho we have been saying that for the last 5 years and his progres is barely noticable
Gunners,3e0hns,Fgge,-1,Tue Jul 21 10:18:11 2015 UTC,"its not just half a season of a defense that was playing shit. its years of making no progress, making howlers a few times every year, and too many games where he has let in every shot on target. he is 25+ so when is this potential going to come to fruition? are you saying we keep him playing shit for another 3 years? 2 years? 5 years?"
Gunners,3e0hns,NiteNiteSooty,4,Tue Jul 21 10:26:52 2015 UTC,"He's 25, that's so young for a keeper. Yeah I say let's stick with him for a few years, and if it doesn't work out then he can go, but at the moment I think we'd be stupid to chuck him on the scrap heap."
Gunners,3e0hns,Benjips,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:28:26 2015 UTC,"yeah, i have no problem with him being #2 or out on loan. im just saying i think its getting a bit late to keep saying he has potential"

Gunners,3e0hns,D4an1el,28,Tue Jul 21 11:02:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe he's about to go on loan there. I think Roma's two keepers, De Sanctis and Lobont, are both in their late 30's."

Gunners,3e0hns,Games_sans_frontiers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:04:12 2015 UTC,How many league matches did Thibaut play after new year? How many did szcz?  Also szcz still finished with at least 4 more errors.   It actually makes it significantly more damning.
Gunners,3e0hns,Blu_Duck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:07:38 2015 UTC,I would be okay with a season long loan for him with ospina being back up
Gunners,3e0hns,ajyahzee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:38:53 2015 UTC,Interestingly Italian channel in Oz mentioned a 12.5 euro bid for him
Gunners,3e0hns,MinionGooner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:16:55 2015 UTC,12.5 euros sounds cheap.
Gunners,3e0hns,Killywilly93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:11:54 2015 UTC,"Trying to find the story online I found a report that we apparently rejected 10 (million) euro from Roma already   http://m.calciomercato.com/news/la-roma-segue-anche-il-portiere-dell-arsenal-638758  Probably all BS, but it is funny there is a story from a month ago, I hear about a newer bid on TV a few days ago and now Szcz is following all the AS Roma players."

Gunners,3e0hns,CheersMate88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:47:31 2015 UTC,If it's a loan then this is the best possible solution for all parties IMO. We get to keep the better player in Ospina and Szczesny will get some time away from the club and plenty of minutes to prove his worth + solid Euros preparation.

Gunners,3e0hns,stevel024,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:08:59 2015 UTC,It's a deal that would make huge sense for Roma. De Sanctis is 38.  I'm just surprised (and somewhat grateful) that Szcz looks to be on the move and not Ospina.
Gunners,3e0hns,xxifruitcakeixx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:46:23 2015 UTC,"Really hope he's not off. But, to be honest a loan wouldn't be too bad...  Although I think learning from training with Cech every day could even be more beneficial than regular first team football?"
Gunners,3e0hns,Searocksandtrees,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:02:44 2015 UTC,Sweatner for Romagnoli?
Gunners,3e0hns,Fgge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:11:23 2015 UTC,I'll take Nainggolan in exchange please
Gunners,3e0hns,Searocksandtrees,-1,Tue Jul 21 05:14:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna be surprised if he transfers to another team. While Cech is better then Szcz I knew we were making a deal that was going to hurt us in the long run in order to win today. Szcz won a golden glove at the age of 23 has tons of potential and what is he going to do while Cech plays for another 3? 4? 5? years? Sit on the bench? go out on loan? There aren't many GK's that went on loan and furthered their careers - don't even say Courtois because he went out when he was young and upon his return he said either play me or sell me but no more loans.   So yes, we got Cech but we risked alot and might very well lose Szcz because of it"
Gunners,3e0hns,HenrysRightFoot,8,Tue Jul 21 02:27:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but Szczesny may have been on his way out anyway.   Don't forget John Jensen's comment after the Southamption game (he that spilled the smoking in the shower incident) that that would be Szczesny's last game for Arsenal. Basically the idea being that the club did think he had loads of potential, but had reached the limits of their patience waiting for him to mature as a professional. So far, Jensen's words have been mostly correct: Szczesny has played only in cup ties and friendlies, not a minute of PL or CL.   On top of that, there were rumours that Szcz was very unhappy to have been benched for Ospina, to the degree that he was agitating for a transfer.  Szczesny has been maintaining a highly professional front in public (denying rumours of being unhappy, being enthusiatic about Cech), so it's all anyone's guess, but if he goes out either on a transfer or loan, I don't think anyone can say it would be any surprise, and I would assume that the club have been making some very well-considered decisions."
Gunners,3e0hns,Wheat-Thins,4,Tue Jul 21 02:38:53 2015 UTC,He did play the FA Cup final
Gunners,3e0hns,Flaminis_sleeves,3,Tue Jul 21 05:27:22 2015 UTC,"yeah: as I said, cup ties. So did Fabianski"
Gunners,3e0hns,Wheat-Thins,8,Tue Jul 21 05:29:19 2015 UTC,Honestly. Who cares. He got a good run of a couple years to lock down the slot. He didn't manage to do so in large part as the result of his own immature actions. I really like Szcz and I thought he was going to be the answer for a very long time. Clearly Wenger lost faith in him and tbh now that we have Cech I don't see a huge reason to question that. It'd be one thing if Wenger wanted rid of him and didn't replace him. But he more than adequately did so. So if it's time to go it's time to go. Szcz is going to be a great goalkeeper regardless and I hope he stays but I won't fault Wenger if he goes either.
Gunners,3e0hns,HenrysRightFoot,5,Tue Jul 21 04:37:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed, people get so attached to mediocre players. Even in his best season, scz wasnt making many mistakes but wasn't really saving us any points either. And our best keeper performance that season by far was fabianski In the fa cup against Liverpool. The idea that scz has huge potential basically only comes from the fact that he plays for us, and that he saved a few penalties at the start of his arsenal career.  wengers had a few unsuccessful keeper development experiences, lets move on."
Gunners,3e0hns,nikyala,5,Tue Jul 21 06:05:06 2015 UTC,"This is very revisionist. He's done more than save a few penalties, and he definitely saved us points in 13/14. Remember Palace away for example?"
Gunners,3e0hns,HarryBlessKnapp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:41:57 2015 UTC,"The fact that palace away, where he made one great save off that jedinak shot, is our best example of him performing just reinforces the point In my mind. The best keepers make great saves more than once a season."
Gunners,3e0hns,Sir_Gunner,4,Tue Jul 21 18:15:34 2015 UTC,I have to say this is a bit harsh. You said you agreed with me but I didn't say a lot of the things you did. There were times when He showed potential for greatness. I don't see how you can say a player that won the golden glove wasn't saving us points.
Gunners,3e0hns,lozzaBizzle,-1,Tue Jul 21 11:11:49 2015 UTC,ooooooOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooshit

Gunners,3e2u18,MadManAmbrose,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:59 2015 UTC,Well to explain myself I fell in love with on of them and he was treating her like shit. He was part of the gang but we never got along that well. Shit happens.  The other one was more like my friend admitted he had a crush on her but didnt do anything so she started hanging out more and more with me and wanted to try something. I entertained the idea but ultimately didnt do anything with her. They didnt believe me after the first incident though. I dont speak too often with those guys anymore. I guess the irony is that the guy who had a crush on the one I didnt do anything with is still very friendly with me and now believe me.  I might do some stupid shit but I always had the best intention. I mean what the fuck do you do when you are in love and the other person feels the same. Regardless if she just started dating my other friend (who fucked girls on the side which I never told her. They just dated really quick and a couple of months later I found out they never even slept before she started hanging out with me).  Didnt make it look any better though. I'm really sorry that happen to you. I don't know what your situation was like but I've lost someone I liked a lot to a friend as well. One of the worst things I've felt

Maybe not too bright telling me when I was at home... I fucking exploded. If I'd been on duty I'd have had chance to calm down, though the obvious flipside of that is I'd have had access to guns and explosives too.

Gunners,3e1t5t,Negrodamus06,3,Tue Jul 21 15:37:20 2015 UTC,There have been rumours that our injury record has stemmed somewhat from Wenger being deadfast against PEDs while other managers are not. So many of the PEDs are to hasten and better recovery. HGH and various steroids.   But it's purely guesswork. Maybe Shad will prove it all wrong next season. The latter part of last season was promising.

Gunners,3e1t5t,Searocksandtrees,15,Tue Jul 21 15:38:10 2015 UTC,"Although I wouldn't call them minor details, how about fitness & consistency?"
Gunners,3e1t5t,pukahuntus,28,Tue Jul 21 09:07:06 2015 UTC,Tactically our players aren't astute enough as individuals. Wenger often waits too long to replace players or change something when we're getting little out of those on pitch. We're too reliant on Ozil. Offensively we looked awful without him last season. And Wenger's love for cohesion and getting a specific 11 in rhythm means we often under-rotate which contributes to our injury problems as well.
Gunners,3e1t5t,phar0aht,14,Tue Jul 21 09:50:11 2015 UTC,"Given that Ozil and Giroud came back at roughly the same time, I'd be tempted to think we rely more on having a strong CF than another attacking midfielder (ridiculously good as he is), then again I tend to think that we simply found our confidence last season and that seems to be more important for us than individual players, our game is rooted in synergy.  I also think our players are more tactically astute than anyone else, due to the way we play, but I can offer no supporting credence to that other than what I see."
Gunners,3e1t5t,Quilpo,9,Tue Jul 21 09:57:40 2015 UTC,"I half agree with you here. Being able to play off Giroud is actually massive for us, you really pick it up in goal compilations. His link up play and flick ons are superb. But before he ball even gets to him Ozil has probably made several passes while we move from the middle 3rd to the final 3rd and helps create overloads for us to work with.  In terms of movement and fluidity of the ball in the final 3rd we really  excell and are probably the best in the league. But when it comes to keeping the ball ticking in the middle/final 3rds there are only really 4 players I trust. Ozil, Santi, Arteta and Rosicky. I think only the former will still be here next season so unless Wilshere becomes that kinda player or we get another Arteta type DM we could get caught out in that respect."
Gunners,3e1t5t,phar0aht,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:07:14 2015 UTC,"I getcha, I was thinking of more off the ball stuff but I can get on board with that, there are varying levels of it in the squad behind those 4 guys though, plenty of development opportunities in the next 18 months.  The thought of replacing Santi is starting to scare me though, if no-one steps up I'm not sure how we replace what he does."
Gunners,3e1t5t,Quilpo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:17:54 2015 UTC,Wilshere is heir to that throne in my book. If he improve his decision making when passing and fine tunes when he decides to carry the ball we'll be fine. I think a change of formation to the 4-4-2 diamond should be on the cards so we can accommodate him and Ramsey.
Gunners,3e1t5t,phar0aht,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:22:25 2015 UTC,"I hate diamonds, but if any team can deal with too many midfielders and not enough wingers, it's us."
Gunners,3e1t5t,Quilpo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:03:56 2015 UTC,Yeah with Wilshere and Ramsey as the CMs we have the ability to create wide using the central midfielders as they're both good ball carriers. Also Alexis and Ozil will be free to roam and we have good attacking full backs so shouldn't be much of an issue.  As well as the fact that Ox is our only traditional winger but he could play a very similar role as a midfielder in that formation.
Gunners,3e1t5t,phar0aht,2,Tue Jul 21 11:33:39 2015 UTC,"I think people overstate Giroud's impact. It's helpful of course to have a striker with good [if a bit overhyped] holdup play and those flick-ons look great when they work out, but to me Giroud is the one benefitting from the midfield play rather than the other way around. Ozil, Giroud, and Coquelin all came into the side at around the same time this past season, if I was to pick out one player who was most helpful in allowing Ozil/Cazorla/Ramsey to stabilize the attack, it would be Coquelin coming in to provide that shield and allow them to be a bit more expressive and adventurous in attack without having to worry as much about allowing the other team to counter."
Gunners,3e1t5t,SalvadorsDeli,3,Tue Jul 21 13:46:25 2015 UTC,"We looked great when we were playing a 4-3-3 with Ramsey and Santi in the middle. I think you're thinking of the period where apart from Ozil we also lacked Giroud, Ramsey and Koscielny."
Gunners,3e1t5t,solaris1990,2,Tue Jul 21 10:33:34 2015 UTC,When did we play a 4-3-3? I only recall the 4-1-4-1 at the beginning of the season with Ozil out wide.
Gunners,3e1t5t,phar0aht,3,Tue Jul 21 10:38:53 2015 UTC,"December - January/early feb... Dortmund at the Emirates and City away were probably the most notable games (we played Alexis and Ox on the wings in both) but we had a prolonged run of form until Tottenham away. Cazorla and Ramsey were the two CMs, with Coq behind them. When Ozil came back we initially played him on the wing but the changed to a 4-2-3-1 while pushing Cazorla back once Ramsey got injured again."
Gunners,3e1t5t,solaris1990,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:58:40 2015 UTC,Ah okay but either way our best team includes Ozil as a 10.
Gunners,3e1t5t,phar0aht,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:28:53 2015 UTC,If I had to pick an XI to play every game of the season it would definitely include Ozil as a #10. Game by game I think it can vary though. For the sort of accomplished defensive performance we played at the Etihad I probably would probably rather repeat last time's selection (but with a more mobile striker).
Gunners,3e1t5t,solaris1990,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:40:38 2015 UTC,"Yeh, there are games where he'd be more useful floating out towards the left more than in the middle, but he goes where he pleases anyway."
Gunners,3e1t5t,Quilpo,2,Tue Jul 21 13:02:47 2015 UTC,We have never been reliant on Özil.
Gunners,3e1t5t,jonahmilo_,2,Tue Jul 21 14:17:34 2015 UTC,"We were pathetic last season offensively without Ozil and the one before that, when the team went into a tailspin, it didn't start when we lost Ramsey, it started when we lost Ozil."
Gunners,3e1t5t,snozberrydriveby,2,Tue Jul 21 14:45:29 2015 UTC,I don't know that we were bad without Ozil as much as defenses had an easier time setting up against us. Ozil demands to be marked with his play style and without him those defenders can be used else where.
Gunners,3e1t5t,DeadCannon1001,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:43 2015 UTC,"Your last point became a particular annoyance of mine towards the end of last season. After we smashed Liverpool with a tactically amazing performance and formation (Ramsey on the right for pressing and then dominating midfield), we persisted with the same formation against teams that in no way called for it.   People on here were arguing about the use of Ramsey on the right as a tactic and how Wenger prefers it for x or y reason, but the real reason was that after the performance against pool, Wenger just didn't want to change it because it had been so good in that game."
Gunners,3e1t5t,gladitsknight,4,Tue Jul 21 11:03:51 2015 UTC,He didn't change it because Santi was completely irreplaceable in the centre but he still wanted to play Ramsey and the only available place was on the right. It was either that or rush back Jack/Feo/Ox and drop Ramsey to the bench.
Gunners,3e1t5t,bigbadbanter,-1,Tue Jul 21 11:58:34 2015 UTC,"Playing Theo at that stage would have hardly been rushing him back, he had been fit for ages. You also just reinforced my point; Wenger refused to change his team or formation after a good performance. Even if Ramsey on the wing, Coquelin holding midfield, Giroud up top might not have been the best suited team for the games."
Gunners,3e1t5t,gladitsknight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:34:34 2015 UTC,Yeah that's it exactly. The performance against Liverpool was the best of the season in my opinion but the longer we persisted with that team the more predictable we got. We were still on that winning streak but you could just see it was gonna end any minute.
Gunners,3e1t5t,phar0aht,5,Tue Jul 21 11:31:42 2015 UTC,"Fix the injury problems up, and make sure we have an adequate 2nd striker and we should be right.   We were 13 points behind Chelsea at the halfway mark last year and we ended up finishing 12 points behind.   2 injuries (Giroud and Koscielny) completely derailed our season because we didn't have adequate replacements for them."
Gunners,3e1t5t,littleredberries,5,Tue Jul 21 09:27:29 2015 UTC,"By ""minor details"" he clearly meant, ""me, bitch.""  Also, Alexis could stand to pass from time to time, and, their overall confidence seems to take a hit too easily.   Arsenal has always seemed more fueled by and sensitive to morale than most - likely Wenger's philosophical vs tactical (meaning, not micromanaged) view.   Alexis didn't get sucked into it fully, still focusing more on his job than the team balance - which paid off in big ways from time to time, but also had him holding the ball too often when, perhaps, team morale was down and he figured he may as well finish.   With Cech and the way I hope he and the back line sync up, maybe we can afford to give a little more individualism to the AM and front line. Still a team, but ultimately they can be confident in themselves even if some members are slipping."
Gunners,3e1t5t,pi69y,3,Tue Jul 21 11:49:40 2015 UTC,"That's why Alexis was so perfect for us, aside from the whole 'quick, technically brilliant and good goalscorer' side of things, his individualism is what we often lack. I doubt it'll change, much like anyone who is that good it's his flaws that define his strengths and vice-versa."

Gunners,3e1t5t,Tranzlater,8,Tue Jul 21 11:27:52 2015 UTC,"Although we did worse against those drifting around in the top half like Swansea, Spurs and Southampton, which is something I hope we sort out this year."
Gunners,3e1t5t,bobthehamster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:49:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it's not like the two are mutually exclusive -- we didn't give up points against the top half teams BECAUSE we took them off the top teams, so hopefully we can work that out and take points off of all the teams."
Gunners,3e1t5t,Ross5512,2,Tue Jul 21 12:47:12 2015 UTC,"That's the important thing, I've heard too many people say 'the key to winning the title is beating the big teams' and 'the key to winning the title is beating the little teams', generally whichever we're not doing at the time, to think much beyond 'winning more games is better'."

I'll humour the thought though, maybe if we solidify the defensive cohesion. Koscielney has been head and shoulders above the rest of defensive line for a while now.

I said getting a better striker and DM (our weaker positions) would give us a better chance.   It also leads to desperation in terms of transfer targets where we'll be happy picking up a Laccazette or a Kondogbia when they really aren't of the quality   I don't know how you've formed these opinions on who is and isn't 'quality' so I cannot argue this.

Honestly at this point we are moving towards winning a title. I think we're no longer in a position to be taking expensive gambles on players. If someone's coming in I want them to be a certified world class player, a young potential world class player or I'd rather stick with what we have. Basically the definition of Arsenal quality needs to change. And Wenger's been on a decent run since about 12/13 but the period before that we picked up some stinkers."

Gunners,3e1t5t,immerc,2,Tue Jul 21 11:46:34 2015 UTC,"Cech has seen his back line being protected by the likes of Makelele, Matic, Diarra, Mikel, Essien, Ramires and Romeu.  I think he understands not only the value of a DM, but also the importance of depth at that position, so I'm going to assume he's talking about a world-class set of DMs.  At the time they had Makelele, seen as one of the best DMs in the world, they also had Essien and Mikel ready to fill in for him, and Makelele was essential in getting them to the CL final and keeping them in it when players like Ronaldo were bursting down the sidelines past their fullbacks."
Gunners,3e1t5t,Quilpo,2,Tue Jul 21 12:40:29 2015 UTC,"We already have half a dozen DMs better than Romeu and Mikel.   I get your point though, a GK is going to look at the defensive side more than anything else."
Gunners,3e1t5t,immerc,2,Tue Jul 21 13:24:00 2015 UTC,Half a dozen?  By my count Arsenal has 2 DMs and I'm being generous by including Flamini.
Gunners,3e1t5t,erts,2,Tue Jul 21 14:17:05 2015 UTC,"We need to stop shitting the bed. We got a habit of falling apart once the morale is down. Great sides of the past whether it be the best Arsenal sides or United sides would always pull back last minute wins if they were drawing or losing. Nowadays if we're 2-0 down by the 60th minute we all pretty much know it's a loss. We need to fight then and there, not wait until the next leg or the next league meeting"

Just minors injuries and we're there imo.  It's always a period for Arsenal when there are alot of long-term injuries and especially on our most important players. In 14/15 it was Özil, Giroud, Koscielny and Walcott in 1st part of the season. In 13/14 it was Ramsey (our best player back then), Walcott and Cazorla in some crucial moments.  We've topped the ""injury league"" a few times. Injuries on Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wilshere have affected their development for example."
Gunners,3e1t5t,uselessrightfoot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:52:05 2015 UTC,"He was talking specifically about individual games vs Chelsea, why Chelsea had an upper hand in them.   People saying ""it is a strikr and a DM"" are missing the point. Of course Chelsea have been the better team in the last 10 years. Not just in those two positions either.  In big games what it comes down to is being ""efficient"" (to use a Wengerism) at both ends of the pitch.   Against Chelsea at Stamford bridge last season, Koscielny made an error in bringing down Hazard. Then, we played a great move involving Ozil and Cazorla who put Wilshere clean through. But Wilshere's touch with his right foot was too heavy, and Cech smothered the ball.  A lot of times it comes down to players making the right decision at the right time. The best players are clinical and they make their chances count."

Gunners,3e1t5t,EvilMonkeyBob,-6,Tue Jul 21 08:38:18 2015 UTC,to say part of the reason chelsea is ahead of us is their coach is better
Gunners,3e1t5t,ottolenghi,7,Tue Jul 21 08:41:06 2015 UTC,I disagree with this.
Gunners,3e1t5t,EvilMonkeyBob,-6,Tue Jul 21 08:49:54 2015 UTC,u think wenger is bettet than mourinho?
Gunners,3e1t5t,acems135,7,Tue Jul 21 08:53:22 2015 UTC,"Your focus should not be who is a better coach, but rather who is the best coach for Arsenal. Mourinho would not have stuck with the Arsenal through our trophy drought.  Mourinho would not have raised the Arsenal youth and promoted them through the ranks when our stars left one by one.  Mourinho would not have had the vision or patience to think ahead through a difficult period, in which we built a new stadium and could not compete financially with Chelsea and Manchester City.  No, Mourinho would rather move to a team with established stars and brand his style of play.  If things don't work out, its always the club's fault, or the players' faults.  No, Mourinho is never wrong...  Arsene Wenger has proven he could compete with the best of the Premier League with his philosophy, during the Invincibles and even after that, our lean years.  Imagine if we failed to land a top 4 spot in any number of consecutive years during that period; it would have been disastrous.  But we persevered, and now we're in a position to challenge for the title for the next few years.  I would rather put my faith in a manager who has stuck with a club through thick and thin than a manager like Mourinho.    So yeah, Wenger is better."
Gunners,3e1t5t,phar0aht,-1,Tue Jul 21 09:13:54 2015 UTC,So basically your reason for saying Wenger is a better manager than Mourinho is that he's durable? Maybe this means he's better suited to Arsenal or better suited to that period of our history but he's definitely not a better manager.   Mourinho's record against Wenger is flawless and he even won the Champions League that really and truly the invincible team should have won.
Gunners,3e1t5t,acems135,3,Tue Jul 21 09:35:20 2015 UTC,"You missed my entire point.  I only compared the two managers on who would be a better coach for Arsenal.  Arsenal had to grow with modern times to stay competitive with other teams.  I'm saying Mourinho wouldn't have been the right manager to lead Arsenal through our growth.  To make it easier for you to understand my implied statement, ""So yeah, Wenger is better (for Arsenal)"".  Honestly, I don't care who is a better coach in general, there is always someone better than you in life.  I only care about Arsenal.  EDIT: To put it another way, Arsenal would not be the side it is now without Wenger.  Yes it took a long time to get to this point, but now we can say with confidence that we have financial pull and world class quality to challenge for the league.  Would we have arrived at this point with Mourinho at the reins? Maybe, maybe not. But I'd rather have it this way."
Gunners,3e1t5t,Quilpo,2,Tue Jul 21 09:47:34 2015 UTC,"In many, many ways.  The only thing Mourinho is better at is eking absolutely everything out of a match, if diving would win a match I'm not convinced that every one of our players would do it, and we wouldn't kick players out of the game, but Mourniho would probably encourage it. Unfortunately, a lot of people look at winning as the bottom line so whoever wins the most recent trophies is going to be seen as the best."
Gunners,3e1t5t,nambitable,-3,Tue Jul 21 09:30:12 2015 UTC,A striker. And it's a major detail. Why should we assume away things?   The minor detail is getting the team pumped and ready for every game. So they don't start games slow like we are apt to do.

Gunners,3dzws8,swiftwings88,31,Mon Jul 20 23:01:13 2015 UTC,"Some really good quotes in there:  On how he found his first week -   “What I’ve found is a group of players who work very hard and are focussed on what they are doing on the pitch to get ready. I’ve found the team spirit quite extraordinary. Everybody pulls in the same direction, which is why I believe we will have a successful season.”  On the mix of ages in the squad -   “We have a good balance. We have players with a lot of experience, who have won the World Cup for example, and young players who want to prove their point and play as much as possible. We have experienced players and hungry players so that balance gives us an advantage.”  On managerial stability -   If you take the situations at Man United and Arsenal with Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger they were very successful because of two great managers. At Chelsea unfortunately there were changes all the time, but we were still winning trophies. It’s hard to say which way is better. If you look at what Chelsea have won over the last 11 years you can’t really argue with what they’ve done. Stability is generally a much better solution,but it’s hard to achieve. Arsenal are very lucky to have had a manager with such qualities for such a long time.  On competition to start in goal -   “The way I work is that I do my best every day to make sure that the boss has no other option but to put me in the team,”"

Over the last season, stability in terms of the fielded XI, set up and player health is what separated them from us imo.  We should really avoid tinkering too much this season. Stick with the 4-2-3-1, add no more than 2 new players and ease them in gradually rather than forcefully. Consistency and momentum is what will keep us within touching distance of Chelsea."

Gunners,3dzws8,zaviex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:59:16 2015 UTC,Your article literally says that they made a profit off player sales. So apparently Roman is still pumping money in (not sure where to) but as far as players are confirmed they are selling more than they are buying.
Gunners,3dzws8,cherlin,5,Tue Jul 21 01:56:31 2015 UTC,profit comparing sales in one window which is dumb. Those players weren't free initially and they were largely financed. A huge chunk of that is one player David Luiz who they sold for a total sum of 50m but won't receive all at once and the net gain on Luiz is 28m pounds at the end of the day not 50 like this comparison makes it seem.  Some players aren't even at the club anymore and Chelsea probably still has installments to play. We do it too often but you can't actually compare straight numbers.

They don't need to buy teams anymore nor is City giving sub par players ridiculous wages. Like last season Chelski bought what they needed and won it, didn't need to break the bank."
Gunners,3dzws8,Macc14,26,Tue Jul 21 00:57:29 2015 UTC,to make the controversial eight mile move   yawn I hate that this will be the narrative when in fact this has seemed like the least controversial transfer between rivals ever
Gunners,3dzws8,Flaminis_sleeves,18,Mon Jul 20 22:32:56 2015 UTC,Yeah. Everyone involved in this transfer has been 100% professional.  Can't wait for the media to try and ruin it by calling Cech 'ex-Chelsea player' or 'Chelsea Legend' from here on out.
Gunners,3dzws8,MattGooner,18,Mon Jul 20 22:45:55 2015 UTC,"It's been really shocking, makes me think I might have misjudged Chelsea/Abramovich a little.   I know I'm right about Mourinho though."
Gunners,3dzws8,Quilpo,23,Mon Jul 20 23:14:17 2015 UTC,"I don't really know how to explain it, but the way Cech words his responses makes them feel so much more genuine than other players being interviewed."

Gunners,3dzws8,solaris1990,7,Mon Jul 20 23:25:08 2015 UTC,"So what explains that past record? Arsene Wenger has never beaten Jose Mourinho. Chelsea lead Arsenal 12-5 in the head-to-heads that Cech played. He must surely have the inside track on how to exploit Arsenal’s weaknesses?   Haha honestly expected him to answer something like ""Because I was in goal."" to that question lol"

TL;DR: I think Giroud has renewed for 2 years on 90k per week.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/3e3qb1/girouds_contract_situation/
Gunners,3e3mpl,Wengyscoat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:58:16 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit surprised by the reactions in this thread. Strikers are scarce in any league and Giroud is a proven premier league striker.

Gunners,3dzba1,rea1itygz,9,Mon Jul 20 21:47:19 2015 UTC,"It's what happened with Vela -- we sold him to Sociedad with a buyback clause in the contract. When he did so well a couple years ago, we could have exercised the buyback option (which was ridiculously low at 3.5m) and then either 1) keep him or 2) sell him back to Real or elsewhere for more money than exercising the buyback clause cost us. We basically did the latter by just selling Sociedad the rights to the buyback clause, so that they could keep him.

Gunners,3dzba1,nvroutofthismaze,11,Mon Jul 20 20:12:02 2015 UTC,Why? What do we get by keeping him on the bench? He doesn't fit our system and its questionable whether he's even quality enough in general. I'd be fine with offloading him for ~10m euros and having a bit more money to play with.
Gunners,3dzba1,johnyann,4,Mon Jul 20 20:17:55 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the ""Joel Campbell's #1 fan"" tag, but you remember that he spent the first half of last season with us right?  And that he never got a single start in the league?  It's clear that Arsene just doesn't rate him high enough"
Gunners,3dzba1,nvroutofthismaze,2,Mon Jul 20 20:24:47 2015 UTC,He had 16 starts and 20 total appearances in half a season for Villarreal. He did his job over there perfectly.
Gunners,3dzba1,johnyann,5,Mon Jul 20 20:33:11 2015 UTC,"Look, I don't want to shit on your boy.  You like him, he's at various times shown a lot of potential (that run in extra time the other day was incredible), i get it.  He was only 22 last season and there's still a ton of time for him to keep improving.  But i don't think the 20 appearances stat is that impressive when it accompanied by the ""only 1 goal"" stat.  I would like us to have a sell-on clause. I think he can eventually go on to good things.  But 1 goal in 20 La Liga appearances after not being able to get off our bench?  Not a strong look."
Gunners,3dzba1,SantiCazorla,4,Mon Jul 20 20:38:01 2015 UTC,Villareal has forwards. They didn't get him to score goals. They got him to be someone that can defend and distribute the ball from defense during counterattacking.  I don't care who you are. You play the role you are given if you are a professional. And Campbell did that so well that Villarreal want to buy him permanently.  You know who else was in a similar position in this stage of his career? Gareth Bale. I'm not saying that Campbell is gonna be as good as him. But we've barely seen what he's capable of just because he is being played in roles that use some of his strengths that are hard to find in wide midfielders these days.
Gunners,3dzba1,jamb23,4,Mon Jul 20 20:48:29 2015 UTC,"Have to say I agree with you in that I still think Joel can do a job for us. How any gooner that watched coq's brilliant return last year can count out a 23 yr old with potential is beyond me. Yes we have depth on the wings but as with any arsenal season there will be an ""injury crisis"" at one point in the season (last year was an improvement but the 7-8 yrs prior bring apprehension to saying those days are behind us)"
Gunners,3dzba1,SantiCazorla,0,Mon Jul 20 21:21:15 2015 UTC,"The difference being that last year it was just the one injury - Arteta - that necessitated Coquelin. It would have to be a monumental injury crisis that ruled out all our out and out wingers in Walcott, Welbeck, Alexis, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Gnabry, as well as our ""can play on the wing in a pinch"" players in Ramsey, Ozil and Wilshere."
Gunners,3e3eme,Hari081,6,Tue Jul 21 17:30:47 2015 UTC,"A tall, speedy LW who likes to cut inside and shoot from the top of the box? And only 21 years old and available for about £21m? I would very much like that.  My only thoughts about why maybe we're not more in it this time is because of Alexis/Theo/Ox.  Draxler might struggle to get as much playing time as he probably wants now.  Even with as many games as we play and as many injuries as a team normally has, it would still probably be tough for him to get 30 starts across all competitions.    We have Gnabry and I'm very curious how much time he gets this year.  He's only two years younger than Draxler is.  And on that note, Draxler could play for 4 years at Juve and we could buy him at the same age that we bought Alexis.  Meaning, we're no longer in the young and cheap model, we can now afford to pay for talent instead of potential."
Gunners,3e3eme,nvroutofthismaze,0,Tue Jul 21 17:47:56 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more along the lines of converting him into a striker. And if anybody can do that, It would be Wenger."
Gunners,3e3eme,nvroutofthismaze,2,Tue Jul 21 18:10:53 2015 UTC,"I think Theo has the right attitude lately: any of our front 3 are ""strikers"".    But the outside two have far more defensive responsibilities than our center one.  Which is where Alexis really excels to me (his nonstop determination to win the ball back), and I think Draxler excels there too.  Expecting him to be more centralized I think would require a big shift in our current play because he's not a hold-up guy, and would negate what I think is so great about him (watch a highlight video of him and at least 25% of it is going to be him on defense.)"
Gunners,3e3eme,TallnFrosty,0,Tue Jul 21 18:20:42 2015 UTC,"If we can't get Benzema, I hope we get Draxler.  I'm sure Arsenal is still monitoring the situation with Draxler, and will bring him in if Benzema falls through."
Gunners,3e3eme,scytheavatar,2,Tue Jul 21 18:18:56 2015 UTC,"You answered your own question, with his injury problems, his age and his lack of strength he's always going to be a long term project, rather than someone who can contribute and make a big impact next season. We already have plenty of players like him in the club so he would be a luxury signing."

Two years after that he already 15 caps for the World Cup winners.  He's not even 22 yet and you think they're crazy for not selling him for one-third of what Raheem Sterling cost?
Gunners,3e3eme,ToeTacTic,0,Tue Jul 21 18:15:45 2015 UTC,Thats great and everything but its hard to fulfill your potential when you're constantly injured. We should know
Gunners,3e3eme,nvroutofthismaze,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:20:27 2015 UTC,"Totally true.  Which is why I think we aren't more in for him now, we want talent not potential.  BUT in this market 30m euros for his potential properly reflects the injury risk.  That price-range is where Jackson Martinez went for.  Draxler has the potential to be much better than either of those and is much younger.  Getting him for less than 30m would be a steal."

Muller is Bayern's golden boy and they most likely wouldn't sell him for any amount of money plus even if they did he loves the club and the fans love him so he wouldn't leave  Chelsea may be able to afford Messi but Liverpool can also afford Reus that doesn't mean is is going to go to Liverpool.  Reus and Gotze both have interest from bigger teams than Arsenal (Juventus/Real Madrid) Very little chance of signing either

Gunners,3e2ugt,AfricanRain,3,Tue Jul 21 15:21:59 2015 UTC,"Agree this is the most likely scenario.  Giroud would be an amazing player as a back-up, and would also be the perfect player to rotate with Benzema when we have a midweek Champions League match, and are playing Stoke the weekend before. Giroud can start at least 10-15 Premier League matches and the team would be just fine.  Having said all that, its conceivable that Wenger would want to hold onto Giroud because Welbeck is younger and because with Welbeck, we would continue to play a very fluid style. With Welbeck as the deputy, we would always be playing with a more fluid and pacey front 3, and the team wouldn't have to go back and forth between that style and the style that we HAVE to play with Giroud, which is with him as a target man."
Gunners,3e2ugt,TallnFrosty,2,Tue Jul 21 15:50:00 2015 UTC,"Pretty much - I can't see Welbeck staying at the club much longer unless he shows massive signs of improvement next season. It's a bit of a shame, really, because I know a lot of Gooners had high hopes for him. Now we know why United weren't so bothered to let him go..."
Gunners,3e2ugt,RiseOpusDei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:52 2015 UTC,Isn't he still injured?  I think that Welbs performance and health both are reasons that we are looking.
Gunners,3e2ugt,2000man,5,Tue Jul 21 18:47:28 2015 UTC,Walcott's already come out and said he's willing to play anywhere across the front 3. It'd be Alexis ---- New Striker ---- Walcott up front. Only effect is Giroud and Welbeck get dropped a wrung and Ozil gets more assists.
Gunners,3e2ugt,ZXXA,0,Tue Jul 21 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"Okay, but Walcott's willingness to play on the right doesn't necessarily mean that he would play there, right? Wenger might not trust him on the right in any kind of big game. And if Walcott's on the bench, then Welbeck actually can't make the matchday squad in some scenarios."
Gunners,3e2ugt,ZXXA,5,Tue Jul 21 15:17:42 2015 UTC,What are you on about? His natural position is on the right. That's the position he can definitely be trusted in.
Gunners,3e2ugt,danatello,4,Tue Jul 21 15:22:19 2015 UTC,I think maybe he is referring to Walcott's lack of defensive work
Gunners,3e2ugt,ZXXA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:36 2015 UTC,Yeah.
Gunners,3e2ugt,RiseOpusDei,0,Tue Jul 21 15:41:38 2015 UTC,"He can't defend. Wenger, over the last six months, seemed to realise that he had less of a lightweight team if his wingers can defend, hence he didn't trust him in that position by the end of last season."
Gunners,3e2ugt,UshmushMcCobo,6,Tue Jul 21 15:40:47 2015 UTC,You play Debuchy when Walcott plays on the right. Simple as. You're not truly suggesting Wenger doesn't trust Walcott on the right are you?
Gunners,3e2ugt,ZXXA,3,Tue Jul 21 15:42:32 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't have access to the inside of Wenger's head - and I wouldn't claim to - so it's all guessing. But I'm saying that based on last season, and based on the overall context of fashionable football tactics right now, I don't see Arsenal playing an all-out-attacking front three in many meaningful games. I think that lesson has been learnt.  Again, I'm not really making any bold claims here: maybe you're right. I just don't think you are."

Gunners,3e2ugt,RamboGiroud,-3,Tue Jul 21 16:32:55 2015 UTC,"Walcott is never going to convince Wenger fully. Welbeck and Chambo are both better options on the right in big games. Heck even having Aaron peel in off the right is a better option because it allows Bellerin to get forward.  EDIT: Perhaps I should have said will never convince me fully, I love going to town on that headless chicken."
Gunners,3e2ugt,Chum680,5,Tue Jul 21 15:33:54 2015 UTC,Completely disagree with pretty much all of that. Theo is class. You'll see that next season.
Gunners,3e2ugt,eliseperfectday,3,Tue Jul 21 15:43:23 2015 UTC,"Walcott produces, but he's completely inept tactically. I hope I am proven wrong next season, but I think Chambo is on the cusp of something. He could be the most complete option we have on the right.  Ramsey is hardly going to be rotated in the middle this year, it really wouldn't surprise me if he was retained as the first choice option on the right side."

If they bring in another forward this window (which I really think they should and they will because their current attack cannot even compare to Barca's) then Benzema is the first in line to leave, especially if he's not the type Rafa wants to have up front.

Gunners,3dxa3y,hollowcrown51,7,Mon Jul 20 11:11:21 2015 UTC,"It just makes sense for Ronaldo to be up front. He's one of the games most prolific finishers, and still a fine athlete. Ronaldo as striker playing closer to goal as his pace declines (he's over 30 now) just makes sense."
Gunners,3dxa3y,Midget_King_Santi,6,Mon Jul 20 12:47:17 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, it's very true that they're front line is lacking when compared to Barca's and the logic does then follow that a better striker should be a priority for them, but more than a businessman, Perez strikes me as an egotist.   If he sees Benz as a favourite I think he'll fight toot and nail to keep him which makes our potential job near impossible unless Benz expresses a desire to come to us. In that vein, this article represents a good first step on our part. That's for sure."

If he had progressed the way he looked at Marseille, sure, but I can't see anyone (United and PSG not included of course) paying more than 40 m£ for him. He can be quite flimsy and has never had that impressive goal scoring record despite always being surrounded by wc players. Higuain looked better in has last years at RM imo."

Gunners,3dxa3y,Flaminis_sleeves,7,Mon Jul 20 11:30:34 2015 UTC,"He's a striker who will just as much look for the assist as score himself though. That he hasn't scored insane amount of goals even though he's played with the likes of Bale and Ronaldo is because he's just as happy to let them have the limelight as himself. In other words, Wenger's perfect striker."
Gunners,3dxa3y,Ferare,0,Mon Jul 20 11:31:26 2015 UTC,"My issue isn't necessarily with his quality, rather that he's yet another player to run between defenders rather than one to play with his back to goal, bringing other players into the attack. I may be wrong, but I think we have had a lot of success because of that."
Gunners,3dxa3y,Flaminis_sleeves,3,Mon Jul 20 14:18:58 2015 UTC,"play with his back to goal, bringing other players into the attack   He's pretty good at this though. He's not a Giroud-type exactly but he can no doubt work with his back against the goal, he is still pretty big and strong, and he is very good at brining other players into attack. He is a real team player."
Gunners,3dxa3y,Ferare,0,Mon Jul 20 14:26:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe I should retract a bit. I'm not against Benzema, or buying him. I just thought that price tag was in the Suarez bracket, rather in the, say Benteke bracket which I find closer to the truth."
Gunners,3dxa3y,Flaminis_sleeves,2,Mon Jul 20 14:31:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, £50 mil is a little too much, but he should go for more than Benteke. If he decides to force a move the price could go down though."
Gunners,3dxa3y,PUDDING_SLAVE,5,Mon Jul 20 14:32:43 2015 UTC,"Euro's value has dropped significantly over the past 2 months or so against the Pound Sterling, making European buys much more value for the money. Where €60m used to be around £50m, now it is £41,794,551.60 according to the latest exchange rate. This is tangential, but even Krychowyiak, who has a €30m exit clause, is £20.8m, proving to be a significant saving in potential transfer value."
Gunners,3dxa3y,HenrysRightFoot,2,Mon Jul 20 14:40:28 2015 UTC,While your numbers are correct it's only advantageous for buy out clauses. Clubs will just ask for the number in GBP and not euros. They know everything you know and they are going to want the same value (in terms of spending power) for the player they are selling.
Gunners,3dxa3y,Nayr91,0,Mon Jul 20 10:58:14 2015 UTC,I heard Pound Sterling is overrated and cost to much to buy...
Gunners,3dxa3y,drop-o-matic,5,Mon Jul 20 11:23:25 2015 UTC,Benzema really isn't that good.    Are you kidding? The guy does all the target man/creative work that Giroud does for our team to provide Ronaldo and Bale in addition to scoring goals on his own. That's not even talking about his consistent European presence.   It's really difficult to understand on what possible basis someone can say he isn't really that good.
Gunners,3dxa3y,Ferare,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:50:32 2015 UTC,"That's taking what I said out of context. He's not as good as that price would demand, but he's a very good player."
Gunners,3dxa3y,drop-o-matic,4,Mon Jul 20 14:39:03 2015 UTC,"Considering world class proven striker/wingers (Ronaldo, Bale, Suarez) are 70-80m I would say that 50m is perfectly reasonable for Benzema. It's not a bargain, but it's what you would expect to pay."
Gunners,3dxa3y,Ferare,6,Mon Jul 20 14:55:19 2015 UTC,"Benzema really isn't that good.    Absolute heresy. He's the best available striker out there, very similar to Lewandowski but more suited to the Premier League because of his physical attributes. And he would look even better for us than he does for Real Madrid because he would be allowed to actually lead the attack, not just support it.   60 m euros? That's 50+ pounds   It's not.   He can be quite flimsy and has never had that impressive goal scoring record despite always being surrounded by wc players. Higuain looked better in has last years at RM imo.    Again, not true. The moment he moves to England you will see for yourself just how terribly wrong this opinion is.  It can be really difficult to look good playing next to Ronaldo because of how incredibly selfish the guy is. Besides, the fact someone doesn't produce week in week out for Real or Barca does not mean he's shit. Just look at Alexis Sanchez. Frustrated the crap out of Barcelona fans for 3 years straight and now I wouldn't trade him for anyone else in the world."
Gunners,3dxa3y,Naaahhh,2,Mon Jul 20 15:21:00 2015 UTC,"He's certainly not shit, I never meant to imply he is. He's a good player, but if you look at Real games he's rarely that impressive. He has lovely speed, and good close control, but we have a ton of those players. Lewandowski for example is clearly the better player."
Gunners,3dxa3y,DevilsLittleChicken,-1,Mon Jul 20 12:50:20 2015 UTC,"Lewandowski clearly the better player? He's really, really not. Very frustrating at times, misses as many chances if not more and is mostly useless for his national team because he can't handle the burden. He has really only clicked for Poland very recently after being paired up with Milik, who btw is the better, more effective striker in that duo. Huge part of Lewy's reputation still comes from that one game against Madrid where he scored four. He can be brilliant at times but he's really not that consistent and you can't rely on him when he doesn't have world class support."
Gunners,3dxa3y,lyth99,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:41:43 2015 UTC,I really dont think hes actually available. I remember madrid playing with both ronaldo and  benzema up top for a while last season

Granted, with service from the likes of Bale, Ronaldo, and (formerly) the wizard of Öz, he should be scoring like that too, but what's not to love about him?    I'd be hyped as if we got him.    And I say that as a huge Ollie fan. One that stands to lose £300 if he doesn't bang in 30 in all comps for us this season."

Gunners,3dxa3y,MorganFreemann,95,Tue Jul 21 04:22:40 2015 UTC,"Similar to my initial impressions on the situation. Benzema is too good to be second-choice striker. He's already won the CL, and La Liga, so he won't be missing much if he moves to Arsenal. Obviously, if Madrid want to play him up front, there is no chance we will seduce him away.   I would love to have Benzema at Arsenal. To me, he's an upgrade on Giroud and having played for one of the best clubs, especially in the Champions League, he shouldn't take much time to adapt the Premier League, and maybe not so long to our system either, since he's often used as a target man at Madrid.  Here's to hoping that Benitez is not a fan of Benzema!"
Gunners,3dxa3y,TheFifthMovement,60,Mon Jul 20 12:26:11 2015 UTC,"My only fear is that if Benzema does become available, United will definitely make a move. They are short in the striker department (lets face it they aren't going to have Chicharito and Wilson as 2nd and 3rd choice when they have all those funds at their disposal) and Benzema might be attracted towards the insane wages they are able to offer + there is the allure of working within a team thats rapidly filling their ranks with quality players (not saying we don't have the quality, just that United pretty much have the ability to bring in whoever they want if available). So in a way it might work to our advantage if he doesn't become available...?"
Gunners,3dxa3y,SeargD,17,Mon Jul 20 08:25:11 2015 UTC,He wouldn't want to be second to Rooney I think.
Gunners,3dxa3y,solaris1990,10,Mon Jul 20 08:43:03 2015 UTC,"Fair point. COMMON BENITEZ, LET BENZEMA GO!"
Gunners,3dxa3y,motownphilly1,6,Mon Jul 20 08:50:08 2015 UTC,"He wouldn't. Rooney's versatile enough to play as he needs to, Benzema's a striker through and through."
Gunners,3dxa3y,GoldenGlobe,4,Mon Jul 20 08:53:18 2015 UTC,"No, LVG has spend the bulk of last season trying to figure out a system that works for United and he won't change it now. No more shuffling the pack and trying to fit Rooney + another striker. Depay, Young, Mata and as it stands Di Maria will all look to compete to be part of the front and they don't lack for CMs to be forcing Rooney into that position."
Gunners,3dxa3y,LH44Gooner,4,Mon Jul 20 12:09:43 2015 UTC,Not sure they'll be that much room for Rooney elsewhere in the team now that they've done so much strengthening though

Gunners,3dxa3y,EFG,105,Mon Jul 20 13:27:55 2015 UTC,"My only fear is that if Benzema does become available, United will definitely make a move.   With the situation between both clubs? Forget it. They're not getting anyone out of Madrid until they agree to sell De Gea for much less that they're currently demanding.   just that United pretty much have the ability to bring in whoever they want if available   Wish people would stop saying that, this is such a myth. Of course they can always overpay to help their case and they often do, but when a player has a few genuine options among other top clubs, he most likely won't go to United. Pogba would have been a United player by now if they were so attractive. Similar with Lewandowski, Benzema, Bale... I can go on. They have completely ruined both Falcao and Di Maria. You think other top players don't see that?"
Gunners,3dxa3y,theRagingEwok,50,Mon Jul 20 15:26:51 2015 UTC,I almost feel sorry for Man U fans at the moment. After enjoying many years of stability courtesy of Fergie and the Class of '92 they seem to be pissing it all away in a mad panic buy.  I am struggling to keep up with the dross they are overpaying for and honestly could not write down a starting 11 for them.   I secretly hope they continue to spunk the money away whilst also tarnishing their reputation. This team will be disassembled again next season and they will blow £100m on a player with the most followers on twitter.

Gunners,3dxa3y,sirlordtom98,13,Mon Jul 20 18:59:26 2015 UTC,"I see your point. But players like Pogba, Lewa and Bale aren't exactly available. They're wanted by their respective clubs and they don't really have any desire to leave just yet I'm assuming. When I say they have the ability to bring in whoever they want I meant they can easily meet buy out clauses and pay players whatever they desire and this unfortunately goes a long, long way in modern football. But you're definitely right about the situation between the two clubs, I had not considered that. Now that Madrid have got Kiko Casilla I'm guessing the attempts to snatch De Gea have ceased and with that, so has any contact between the clubs."
Gunners,3dxa3y,Ferare,7,Mon Jul 20 14:55:51 2015 UTC,"If money was all he wanted, Pogba would not have left United. All he wanted to do was play regular football (Kind of irrational given he was a 19/20 year old.) Moyes wanted Bale and bid for him, I think actually more than what RM offered or the same, and Bale chose Madrid (for many reasons.) People love money, but they also love playing. Some more than others yes. But, United can buy up every 20 year old prospect in football, pay all the buyout clauses and ridiculous wages, and then when the question is asked by the player ""Am I getting regular first team football?"" Ed Woodward shits himself, packs up his belongings and waddles out towards the nearest rest room to clean himself up.   Edit: Additionally, think of Casilla as our Ospina and De Gea as Cech. If Cech comes along, ya get him, regardless of what you already got."
Gunners,3dxa3y,Skiinz19,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:06:29 2015 UTC,"If money was all he wanted, Pogba would not have left United.   To be fair I've heard that at least under Fergie, United didn't pay that much to young players and he was very stubborn about that rule as you would expect from him."

If Cech comes along, ya get him, regardless of what you already got.    Casilla was just bought. So he'll be there, and he wont be 3rd keeper, no one gets treated like that. Keylor Navas would be the one having to leave, but since he's got that number 1 shirt I'm ruling that out. De Gea will be a United player next season."
Gunners,3dxa3y,kwatto,-9,Mon Jul 20 13:47:51 2015 UTC,"So you see the has-been goalkeeper who is being upgraded as Ospina, and the young, promising keeper who had a fantastic season despite low expectations as Cech? How do you add that up?"
Gunners,3dxa3y,TheFifthMovement,8,Mon Jul 20 18:19:46 2015 UTC,"Casilla, not Casillas. RM just got a new keeper this past week to repalce that 'has-been keeper.' I'm saying, that getting Casilla won't mean they won't go for De Gea. It's like us having 2 senior keepers didn't stop us immediately going for Cech. If it's an immediate and obvious upgrade, you take it without question. That was the comparison and how I 'added' it all up."
Gunners,3dxa3y,Ross5512,-3,Mon Jul 20 10:48:24 2015 UTC,"But players like Pogba, Lewa and Bale aren't exactly available.   Nah, they are (or in case of Bale were) all available. Pogba already has one foot in Barcelona (which is why he might be staying at Juventus for another season with their transfer ban and why they suddenly decided to get rid of Vidal), Lewy's agent has been shopping him around for a while now (source: local media, I'm Polish) and Bale was apparently free to leave at the start of the window for the right price, it's just that he didn't want to. Now the ship has sailed as Benitez sees him an integral part of the team.  Di Maria, Falcao, Schweinsteiger all ended up at United because they had no other choice. Even Schneiderlin preferred Arsenal and waited for us till the last minute. I have yet to see a top player who genuinely wanted to go there because he believed in the project and the manager. Okay, maybe Memphis, but that was a special case."
Gunners,3dxa3y,flash_cannon,4,Mon Jul 20 11:22:31 2015 UTC,"I thought Di Maria and Falcao both had choices to go elsewhere. Weren't PSG interested in Di Maria initially? He definitely would have been a starter there AND would have gotten champions league football but he chose United. Falcao also had ridiculous wage demands which only United were willing to meet. And as for Schwinsteiger, the transfer makes sense because he saw a chance to play for a big team this late in his career under a manager he's already had experience with. The Schniederlin example only strengthens the fact that money is a major influence in players decision to move to a club. He definitely would have been a starter for us, we're already in the group stages of the Champions League, but he chose United because of higher wages. I'm not saying all players move for money, because thats simply not true, but if theres a situation where the player is looking for a new club, and their current employers are willing to sell at the right price, I would say United have the advantage."

And as for Schwinsteiger, the transfer makes sense because he saw a chance to play for a big team this late in his career under a manager he's already had experience with   Schweinsteiger wasn't offered a new contract. And his relationship with Van Gaal is far from perfect btw. He was one of the players responsible for kicking him out of Bayern.   The Schniederlin example only strengthens the fact that money is a major influence in players decision to move to a club.   It's complicated. AW clearly wasn't convinced because we were still looking at the likes of Vidal and Kondogbia. Why should Morgan suddenly accept half the money at a club which is clearly not sold on him? Make a firm move early in the window and he's an Arsenal player IMO. Basically, his demands might have been excessive but I kinda see why tbf. We didn't exactly fight for him. The club kept him as an option in case nothing better comes up, which is kinda poor. And I know for a fact he really wanted to come to Arsenal and was available to us till the very end."

One thing is for certain though, we cannot compete with them financially and thats an advantage to them.

We also have a more attractive squad overall, with a French manager and his mate Ozil. Only way he'd go to United is for money."
Gunners,3dxa3y,Apocsky_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:05:34 2015 UTC,We will loose Benzema to United on wages if he actually does become available.   To me it's that simple.  Plus they have DDG as a bargaining chip. I don't think Scz or Ospina has the same weight...
Gunners,3dxa3y,Ross5512,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:41:13 2015 UTC,Haha Real madrid has all the leverage against Man U so no...
Gunners,3dxa3y,johnnygrant,2,Mon Jul 20 16:20:31 2015 UTC,To everybody he's an upgrade on Giroud.
Gunners,3dxa3y,veigar7,0,Mon Jul 20 19:18:50 2015 UTC,That's dandy bro.
Gunners,3dxa3y,islander1,20,Mon Jul 20 16:34:46 2015 UTC,"What a fucking signing this would be if it happened. Not only would we have THE Karim Benzema up front, we'd have Theo and Alexis supporting him and we'd see Ozil at his absolute fucking best again with talent like that in front of him.  Not bashing Giroud at all but Benzema is the type of player to bring out the best in players around him, that isn't to say Giroud is bad, it's just that Benzema is THAT good."
Gunners,3dxa3y,MattGooner,3,Mon Jul 20 23:02:54 2015 UTC,I was just wondering if Walcott would stick around if Benzema was signed. It'd all but confirm that central berth being dominated by Giroud/Benzema.
Gunners,3dxa3y,drop-o-matic,13,Mon Jul 20 13:54:27 2015 UTC,Yesterday he came out saying he was less set on playing as a  CF because the front three are so interchangeable these days...sounds like Wenger has convinced him it's not the end of the world if we sign a new CF
Gunners,3dxa3y,JKultra,6,Mon Jul 20 14:02:26 2015 UTC,It's Welbeck's playing time that will be most in trouble.
Gunners,3dxa3y,MagmaManOne,3,Mon Jul 20 14:05:28 2015 UTC,"he's a winger in the cup games then, that settles it"
Gunners,3dxa3y,TomClaydon,4,Mon Jul 20 16:31:29 2015 UTC,"Theo, I don't think, really cares about starting centrally.  He is okay playing wide, as long as he is allowed to move centrally in the attack (read: limited defensive responsibilities)"
Gunners,3dxa3y,EMAWGooner,2,Mon Jul 20 18:17:36 2015 UTC,"Theo has always worked as a winger, does he really have any room to complain if a world class player like Benzema is available?"
Gunners,3dxa3y,JMaboard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:26:40 2015 UTC,"I think he would put his central-ambitions on hold with that kind of firepower coming in, imo he's more about winning things than exactly his position on the pitch."

If Karim was an option, I would give Walcott all the games he wants. On the wing."

Gunners,3dxa3y,MagmaManOne,6,Mon Jul 20 09:10:52 2015 UTC,"He deserves the same as Alexis or Mesut, if it's the only way to get him then give him higher. I wouldn't want to completely screw over our wage structure for him though"
Gunners,3dxa3y,Barkasia,4,Mon Jul 20 15:12:51 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of this higher-tier of wages Arsene is building to bring in experienced talent, if he can put Mesut, Alexis and Cech in the £100,000+ club, why not Benzema? Nobody would argue with that. I expect Ozil would become even happier here."
Gunners,3dxa3y,MagmaManOne,2,Mon Jul 20 16:06:31 2015 UTC,We won't sign him if we don't. Man U are going to come in with mad money.   Karim would likely only sign to us for two reasons: footballing reasons or playing in London. Man U are throwing mad cash around but they will need time to settle to really go after the title. We are going to compete for it with or without any new signing. Benzema could join to jump on that train of gold down to London.

Some think Giroud is favorite to be France's starter, others think Benzema gets the nod.  They are similar players, people shouldn't be so quick to dismiss Giroud's contribution to this squad and the important goals he's scored over the last few seasons. More importantly, his outstanding link up play and related assists have been crucial. Benzema is a star and hearing his name linked with Arsenal is a feel good thing. I for one think Benzema would be icing on the sexy cake of a football team we already have."

Gunners,3dxa3y,yankonthis,3,Mon Jul 20 13:04:26 2015 UTC,"Benzema is the type player Wenger hoped Poldi could be. He's fast so when we have breakaways an actual striker is able to keep up with the play instead of just the midfielders. Let's face it Giroud isn't fast enough.   When teams park the bus Giroud can't score because his best game is being in and around the box. Benzema has the ability to drop deep and run at defenders so he brings a different dimension to our attack which honeslty needs changing at times because Giroud's link up play as every likes to hgighlight is useless when he's being double treamed in the box by the CBs.  Benzema is more mobile than Giroud so he's able to play better 1-2 passes through the defense. If you haven't noticed Giroud does alot of one off flicks and then never sees the ball again because once he makes the pass, he's not quick enough to run into space to get the return.  Lastly, Benzema has won eveyrthing in club football and played with some of the biggest players in football and those big personalities who are dirven to win rub off on you and that will help those players in our team who just don't have that big game winning mentality."

Gunners,3e2go4,Shareh,3,Tue Jul 21 13:19:16 2015 UTC,"I know it's mf somewhere, but What kind of player/position?"
Gunners,3e2go4,NiteNiteSooty,4,Tue Jul 21 13:23:32 2015 UTC,I think he plays a similar position to what Cazorla has been doing for us. A deeper lying playmaker with a good passing range. Only really seen him play in the CL but he was really good against us at the Emirates. Don't know much else about him tbh.
Gunners,3e2go4,Shareh,3,Tue Jul 21 13:25:19 2015 UTC,All I know is the spuds were after him for a couple of seasons

Gunners,3e2go4,Chipsndavey,3,Tue Jul 21 14:10:07 2015 UTC,Mendes wants money for himself. Forces teams to pay absurd amounts to be able to have his players play for them. So a 25m player ends up costing 40m.  ...unless I'm thinking about someone else.

Gunners,3e2go4,hangaram,5,Tue Jul 21 13:23:28 2015 UTC,"That source came from RMC.   It could be, I think. Arsene usually likes player who showed good performance against us.   But, he is too short & his agent is Mendes."

Gunners,3e2go4,hangaram,-2,Tue Jul 21 13:36:47 2015 UTC,"I know.. But, look at our central players...  I want 6 feet player in that position. If we already have big player in our team, I want to take him. But..."
Gunners,3e2go4,bellend1234,7,Tue Jul 21 13:38:39 2015 UTC,Coquelin wins plenty of headers and this guy would probably start over him in home against teams where we need to break down a bus. 6 ft is gassed up too much. Overrated height in football.

Gunners,3e2go4,sparkyhughes89,0,Tue Jul 21 14:24:44 2015 UTC,Does he clip his lego hair on as well?
Gunners,3e2go4,Ross5512,2,Tue Jul 21 14:30:19 2015 UTC,I'd allow it.
Gunners,3e2go4,Quilpo,2,Tue Jul 21 13:19:47 2015 UTC,"Not seen him play for a few years, so unless he's changed drastically we have a fair few players in that position already."

Gunners,3e2go4,hangaram,0,Tue Jul 21 13:27:56 2015 UTC,"I also agreed with your idea. But, he is good at DM.   I think he is more all around player we have in right now."

Gunners,3e2go4,DJKhaled_anotherone,9,Tue Jul 21 14:37:44 2015 UTC,Ahahaabababab. Aaaaaayyy. Delusion. Moutinho would start ahead of Coquelin every single time

Gunners,3e2go4,Quilpo,4,Tue Jul 21 15:04:18 2015 UTC,"A few do seem to overrate the contribution of one midfielder to a team performance, but Coq was really quite good for us last saeson."
Gunners,3e2go4,BestOfSilver,0,Tue Jul 21 15:35:13 2015 UTC,"I think he was great as well, but he still lacks offensively and I doubt he'll keep his form so high."
Gunners,3e2go4,bomko,3,Tue Jul 21 15:36:52 2015 UTC,"The thing is and I said that a few times here the way that coq plays there's a very little chance of him dropping hard, maybe a slight drop in form but that's it. Because his main attributes do not depend on physical abilities but are more about anticipation, positioning, discipline.. Attributes that are not that much dependent on form unlike strikers or riskyothers that do most work with the ball"
Gunners,3e2go4,A_CHEEKY_NANDOS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:27:10 2015 UTC,They're either going to say we were unlucky with injuries and he burned out or stick their heads in the sand and insist that he's world class. Guaranteed.
Gunners,3e2go4,Quilpo,-3,Tue Jul 21 18:40:34 2015 UTC,Because a guy who's played in Portugal for most (all?) of his career will obviously be well suited to the Premiership. He's looked decent the few times I've seen him but I really doubt he'd do half of what Coq can do.
Gunners,3e2go4,DJKhaled_anotherone,0,Tue Jul 21 15:32:15 2015 UTC,Hahahahha. Oh my sides. I wouldn't even argue with that kind of stupid reasoning. How about Coquelin who played his whole life in the Championship? What makes you think K he's good enough? That's probably the stupidest thing I've ever heard. And he plays for Monaco that thumped the shit out of Arsenal. Monaco isn't in portugal.
Gunners,3e2go4,TheYellowKingg,2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:55 2015 UTC,"Why is the best possible transfer one where the player doesn't start over Le Coq? Surely if there's a chance to get a significantly better player (such as Javi Martinez) that would be the best option? That way Coq is your ""more than decent cover""."
Gunners,3e2go4,PUDDING_SLAVE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:47 2015 UTC,Think he's an archetypal #8. And for £14m (according to the article) not an expensive purchase.
Gunners,3e2go4,Young_Amini_Man,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:26:25 2015 UTC,This would actually be a pretty solid signing as long as the fee isn't too high. He isn't world class but from what I've seen he is solid.

Gunners,3e2go4,hangaram,0,Tue Jul 21 13:30:18 2015 UTC,"He can play all central positions.   Basically, if he isn't short, he is the man we are looking for.   Good at passing & defensive contribution & etc.. Especially, he is good at set piece."
Gunners,3e2go4,goonerben3010,7,Tue Jul 21 13:31:55 2015 UTC,He is 5 foot 7 in. Not a good defender. Could play cazorla role as someone else said but not the coqs role
Gunners,3e2go4,hangaram,-2,Tue Jul 21 13:42:04 2015 UTC,"?? He is a CM/CDM/ACM player.  We all know he isn't a defender. If you mean DM role, what about a great player like Makelele?   If you say we need a big player in that position, then I agree with you. But, you just don't rate him cause he is short."
Gunners,3e2go4,goonerben3010,3,Tue Jul 21 13:43:50 2015 UTC,Im stating that he couldnt play defensive midfield. Hence why I say he couldnt play coqs role. You still need to defend in that role
Gunners,3e2go4,hangaram,0,Tue Jul 21 13:47:52 2015 UTC,"He already plays in DM role. I couldn't understand your opinion.   Apparently, he couldn't be a player alongside with Cazorla, but he could be a player alongside with Ramsey.   Look at his record"
Gunners,3e2go4,goonerben3010,0,Tue Jul 21 13:49:41 2015 UTC,"I was merely referring to    Basically, if he isn't short"

Gunners,3e2go4,etzy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:59:27 2015 UTC,He is famous for his defensive contributions but so are Ramsey and Rosicky. Just because a CM puts in tackles and has good workrate doesn't mean he can play as a DM.
Gunners,3dxy25,jfshay,17,Mon Jul 20 13:17:40 2015 UTC,I think you have confused Negredo with Jesus Navas. Negredo is a target man and not a very quick one at that. I agree with what you are saying if you are talking about Navas though

Gunners,3dxy25,Entrepreneur_Girl,16,Mon Jul 20 13:36:13 2015 UTC,"Lurking on rival subs (utd supporter not much news on the soccer and Red Devils sub) this is quite an interesting read. I'm just wondering as to why people think United won't do really well this season. We may not win the league but I'm eyeing a top 2/3 finish. We have addressed our issues. Our midfield. Blind hasn't been great at filling in for carrick, we did need a successor and Morgan is a perfect fit in my opinion. Then we need a leader and schweinsteiger is perfect for Herrera and Morgan to learn from. Schweinsteiger has won nearly everything under the sun, he will instill a sense of discipline in the squad that is needed. Memphis I enjoyed watching In our preseason match he had good vision and how he linked up with rooney was a joy to see. He still needs time to adapt I doubt he will hit the ground running in the season but I'm loving the potential I've seen so far.   We still need to sort out a centre back, we have a very young defense all below the age of 25. We do need an experienced leader. Whether it's Otamendi or Ramos. The striker situation I would honestly love for us to buy another but LVG stated he wants rooney alone. Truthfully, Rooney isn't always consistent in terms for goals. He has a dry spell every season and if he is injured we have Hernandez who isn't a great starter and we have Wilson who is very young and inexperienced. Memphis could be used a striker at times, he was used as a striker in our preseason game against club America and if we do get Pedro in he could help out in the wings whilst Memphis is played up front.   Sorry I have mixed our new signings with possible signings, got in to deep with my opinion."
Gunners,3dxy25,gladitsknight,23,Mon Jul 20 14:59:58 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason is that united have bought 4 new first team players, potentially 5 if you add in a central defender. So that is half of your outfield players new, on top of an already pretty dysfunctional team. Last season it took until deep into the second half for United to look convincing, and then you followed that up with another string of poor results.   Basically you can't overhaul half your team and expect to hit the ground running, no matter the quality of the players brought in. It will take a lot of time to click and I'm not even convinced Van Gaal has what it takes judging by the calibre of United's performances last year. You had quality players last season as well but the coach resorted to hoofing it to Fellaini...   Also the defence is far from convincing, though they will benefit from the new midfield pairing."
Gunners,3dxy25,Entrepreneur_Girl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:25:55 2015 UTC,"Carrick became very important for us this is why we crumbled without him, hence why we got in needed reinforcements for our midfield who may fit the bill because carrick won't be playing every single game, I think he will get a max of 15 games this season that includes all competitions. I'm still not happy with Rooney being our main striker I honestly hope it gets addressed as before the end of the transfer window.  I"
Gunners,3dxy25,gladitsknight,7,Mon Jul 20 15:56:20 2015 UTC,"Really? I think Rooney is a brilliant striker (until he gets to an international tournament...) and I'd kill to have him at Arsenal.   Your problems last year did not stem solely from Carrick. In my opinion, this year you should be worried about team cohesion, a suspect defence, and the manager. Look at how Spurs and Liverpool did after bringing in so many players, and it seems like there will be at least 2 more coming in.   Mourinho added 2 outfield starting players and ran away with the league. I'm not saying you shouldn't be buying all these players, because the squad needed significant investment. But this coming season I think will be another struggle, which is why other supporters aren't overrating United's chances."
Gunners,3dxy25,Entrepreneur_Girl,2,Mon Jul 20 16:09:20 2015 UTC,Rooney is great when in form but he does have really dry spells and the dry spells come at a time where the team needs goals the most. It happens every season. We need a back up for him when he hits those bad spells. We don't even need a a cavani or a lewondowski. I would be happy with a Charlie Austin
Gunners,3dxy25,thatlur,3,Mon Jul 20 16:20:29 2015 UTC,I think you'll do well but other people might not because the main issue you had last season was creativity and it looks like you will be selling your most creative player (Di Maria).
Gunners,3dxy25,Entrepreneur_Girl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:20:48 2015 UTC,Sadly di Maria doesn't want to stay it looks like :(
Gunners,3dxy25,dipodunk,3,Mon Jul 20 15:47:39 2015 UTC,"What makes you know Memphis wont be a flop? How do we know Bastein wont get injured like he has done in a lot of recent seasons? How do we know this Van Gall philosophy will consistently work? How do you know all of your signings will settle in and not take time to become a team like Liverpool did this year? While I think you will finish top 4 and may contend for the title, there are still a lot more questions about your side  compared to Chelsea, Arsenal and City who all have players who all know how to play together."
Gunners,3dxy25,drop-o-matic,2,Mon Jul 20 15:21:02 2015 UTC,"You have already done huge business but arguably still need more additions or for some players to massively step up performances. In particular, your backline looks the weakest it's been for at least a decade. Also another striker maybe?"
Gunners,3dxy25,Entrepreneur_Girl,2,Mon Jul 20 16:02:52 2015 UTC,"I rate that United need 2 centre backs because I am not convinced about our back four. Rojo maybe but Smalling and jones not too much. Shaw has been training heavy he has bulked up well in fact, hoping that will lessen his injuries this season and we have Matteo, but LVG still thinks Valencia does a great job as right back so he is still our 1st choice right back which is baffling to me. LVG isn't keen in getting another striker which angers me because we need it. We let 3 strikers go this season and I wouldn't be surprised if he converts Memphis into a striker (because LVG loves to make players versatile) to accommodate for Pedro."

City I think get worse every year, even with Sterling and Delph added, Liverpool got better and will challenge for top 5, and that's basically it."

Gunners,3dxy25,gooderfootball,3,Mon Jul 20 21:18:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, and certainly the deals that go on are as bizarre to me as anyone else, but here's a quote from a BBC article when he signed:  ""Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo has joined Valencia on a season-long loan deal. The Spanish club have an obligation to make the deal for the 29-year-old permanent at the end of the season.""  I've read before that one incentive to do deals like this is for financial fair play-style purposes. You can count the player as both on and off your books at the same time or something like that - you can still count him as an asset but you can also count the income he's brought in - the end effect being you look richer than you are.

I wrestled with including him (his fee was the same as Schweinsteiger's) because I wasn't sure how much of an impact he'll have. After Serie A's top four or five clubs, I don't know the league well. Do you rate him high enough to have an impact at Man U?"
Gunners,3dxy25,ClaudeLemieux,22,Mon Jul 20 14:55:32 2015 UTC,He will be a starting XI player for them so i think he deserves a mention.
Gunners,3dxy25,bigbadbanter,9,Mon Jul 20 15:06:09 2015 UTC,I really do think so.  And ManU's intent score has to definitely be a 9.  Those are all great signings.
Gunners,3dxy25,ClaudeLemieux,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:06:27 2015 UTC,Can't call signings great until the league starts. That mistake's been made with Spurs and Liverpool before. To get to a 9 or 10 I think you really need to be buying superstars and not guys from a bunch of different leagues and countries that could struggle to adapt or gel. Schneiderlin is a good signing but I'm not totally convinced about the rest of them.
Gunners,3dxy25,bigbadbanter,5,Mon Jul 20 16:46:06 2015 UTC,"I'll give you Darmian, but Schweinsteiger is an established star.  I don't think it's a serious stretch to call Schweini a great signing."
Gunners,3dxy25,Zippy129,4,Mon Jul 20 16:53:03 2015 UTC,"Not doubting his quality but he could have issues with injury and fitness, problems he's had with Bayern over the last few seasons even with their coaches and now he's moving to a more physical league to a team that had massive injuries last season and he's now reaching the age where his body starts to decline even more."
Gunners,3dxy25,bertie__wooster,6,Mon Jul 20 17:09:20 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but are you informed enough to be making this list? I did agreed with quite a lot of your descriptions, but each of the statement of intent scores are very debatable and I don't quite understand how you can exclude Darmian. He is their £14 million right back signing, who was the best full back in Serie A for the past 2 seasons. Given this, United made 4 signings that will go straight into the XI, how is that not a 10/10 statement of intent? Is it because the spending has been relatively prudent bar Schneiderlein? I also couldn't quite agree with some of them comments you've made in here and you seem to be overrating Falcao and underrating Podolski.    Edit: just reread, I come off a bit of a dick. I don't mean to criticize too heavily, and thank you for making this post it is definitely interesting content."

I don't bill myself as an expert on these issues and am sure that I'll make mistakes and present opinions that people with disagree with.  The signal of intent ratings were a last-minute add that I'll give more attention to going forward--I'd probably give MUFC 9/10 so far because their signings have been, as you point out, prudent rather than overpowering.  Some others suggested that Damian does merit a mention. I chose to exclude him a bit arbitarily and will add him in next time...  Thanks for the feedback!"

Both Manc clubs have thrown a bit of cash around, and frankly I'm terrified of United's chequebook.  I don't think Sterling was really worth it, but Delph at 8m was a good buy, as was depay at 20.  The most concerning thing about United is that they've still got some deficiencies in the squad, and I don't think their shopping spree is over.  Mind you, it would be glorious to smash those cunts after they spend 100m net this window."
Gunners,3dxy25,thegamedev,4,Mon Jul 20 14:10:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I was about to say this. There is no way that Man U have made less than a 9/10 statement of intent. This is their second season spending title challenging money.
Gunners,3dxy25,gooner_90,2,Mon Jul 20 16:38:30 2015 UTC,Yep - plus they just bid 100m euro for Muller (whether or not they get him is beside the point - the intention is there).
Gunners,3dxy25,questionernow,0,Mon Jul 20 23:51:24 2015 UTC,Depay cost 31 Million Pounds. http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33114102

Gunners,3dxy25,Ross5512,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:23:57 2015 UTC,"United have signed some quality players, exactly in the areas they needed to."
Gunners,3dxy25,madooner2810,8,Mon Jul 20 15:35:34 2015 UTC,"Don't think Chelsea really need to give out any statements of intent really. They've done pretty well in replacing Cech with a younger, quality keeper with a couple million quid to spare and Falcao who, despite a poor season, still has pedigree and is a name you'd notice even when on the bench. Don't really think their starting XI needs any work. Maybe the 2 CB's given that Terry is old and Cahill looked unconvincing on a few occasions. They seem to be addressing that with the Stones bid. That'd be a good signing. Could also look into finding replacements for Cuadrado and Salah if they do move on. Shouldn't be too much of a problem.  Have no idea about how City will get on. Interesting to see people write them off. Still quality, despite the number of potential retirees. Fernando - dinho - Yaya just doesn't have that spark or energy. Delph is a benchwarmer. They need that big midfield signing. Dunno if Pogba is realistic but he'd be a hell of a signing. Defence needs work as well, especially if Kompany hasn't gotten his shit together. Reckon they're alright up front if they can keep Aguero fit.  United have really flexed their financial muscles. Bought well but don't know how it'll play out for them. A lot of their buys last season probably won't get game time because of this window's activity. LvG tinkered so much with the squad last year, going to be a bigger challenge this time around. Didn't have any identity about them and played dire football. They have work to do to get to playing decent footy but if you throw enough money at the wall, you're bound to get something right. Should be looking for a top CB and maybe a striker, depending on Van Gaal's plan for Rooney.  As for us, i've never honestly felt more at ease during a window as i have this time around. Brought in a worldy keeper right at the start of the window. Real ruthlessness from Arsene, dropping 2 perfectly capable keepers. Something we haven't seen in a long time. Hard to believe that this was the same man who put up with Almunia for so long.   We've all talked about a DM but i'd like for us to go in for a top striker more. If reports about Benzema are true, we shouldn't hesitate to pony up Ozil money for the bloke. He would transform the side. Bit of an issue with Ollie in the side. Neither would be keen as they compete for the National Team spot. We can dream.   With FlimFlam probably moving and Arteta's injury woes, we're probably looking for a DM as well. Unless we can get our Javi Martinez or Busquetes, i'd like to see us to look at Ki. 10-15 m quid and an excellent player. He'd fit the bill perfectly and would imo give Coq a run for his money. Would be a brilliant signing."
Gunners,3dxy25,mzpq,4,Mon Jul 20 14:24:20 2015 UTC,"Good to have you back! Always love reading these.  As for our business, I think Cech is a very important and potentially underrated upgrade. Not only will his individual quality shine through (hope to see more saves like the one he had in the BAT the other day!) but he will keep our back line calm and organized, and bring a habit of winning that hopefully rubs off on our other players.  Rumor-wise, don't hear much happening regarding a DM these days. With every day that passes I believe Wenger is going to stick with Coq as our main DM and Arteta as back-up. However, with Flamini rumored to depart, that might be a sign that somethings might get shaken up.  However, if we are to bring in Benzema, I think that instantly elevates us to title contenders. With our defense shored up with Cech's entrance, if we were able to rotate between Giroud (who would probably be the best back-up striker in the league) and Benzema, we won't be in very good shape striker-wise. That's not including Theo looking more and more confident in the role as well.   With the news yesterday that Theo isn't worried about his contract and is more open now to playing anywhere upfront because of the fluidity of our front line, it seems like Wenger may have cooled him on the idea of solely playing as a CF, opening up that spot to bring someone else in. I was worried about our need to bring in an out-and-out striker and Theo's contract negotiations, as that's been a sticking point for him. That news has quelled my fears a bit.  All in all, I think we're off to a good start, but we'll really push on to that next level if we bring in Benzema, so fingers crossed!"
Gunners,3dxy25,thegamedev,3,Mon Jul 20 13:31:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry if it's been pointed out earlier, but Falcao would be on loan from Monaco. United chose not to exercise his purchase clause, so he returned to Monaco who have now loaned him to Chelsea."
Gunners,3dxy25,Willszz1,3,Mon Jul 20 16:13:33 2015 UTC,"Given recent news about Man U's €100M bid for Müller, I would put their intent at 11/10."

I think he still offers a threat with a proper midfield of Schneid, Schwein and Mata behind him.  Agree with others in the thread that Man Utd have done everything they can to address their weaknesses, barring better alternatives for Rooney up front. Signal of intent: 9 out of 10."

Gunners,3dxy25,theRagingEwok,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:04:30 2015 UTC,"Not sure I agree with your points regarding Arsenal and Chelsea.   After blockbuster deals for Özil and Alexis, the £9.8m transfer-fee for Čech might feel like a bit of a let-down.   This still is a blockbuster deal. Before United got Bastian, Cech became the most expensive over 30 player in the premier league. Keepers are usually cheaper on average, that's why the fee seems insignificant.   For the first time since Seaman, Arsenal have a world-class keeper.    Mad Jens would be mad.   As with Diaby, Podolski’s departure may signal a more-strategic, less-sentimental era under Arsène…   Does it? Diaby is still allowed to train with the team, and Wenger didn't technically released him, just didn't grant him renewal. As for Podolski, I think Wenger just didn't want to see him unhappy so he let go of him. I still think Poldi would have been a great impact sub for us and we would have had proper use for him during the season.   (Chelsea) Signal of intent: 6/10.   When you are spending what Chelsea did year after year, your'e bond to eventually enter a great state of balance, depth and intent in the squad. Chelsea definitely have signaled high intent. Falcao is an upgrade on Drogba, and Begovic is also an upgrade on an unhappy Cech."
Gunners,3dxy25,jonahmilo_,2,Mon Jul 20 15:14:42 2015 UTC,"ManU reeks of how Van Gaal's Holland plays. A drilled defense (with no big names), a midfield geared towards sitting back, wings with speed (providing they don't sell Di Maria), and a number ten who can hopefully make magic (Mata/Looney). All they need is a big striker to come in and they are set.  If all else fails, send Afro up to wreak havoc."

Gunners,3e28a6,Gooner37,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:54 2015 UTC,"Yes. It depends on a number of factors. If the players came with their own cars, you could do that. Most of them drive suv type vehicles. I can tell you most of thr cars if they hadn't upgraded or anything. Giroud-Mercedes ML Alexis-Range Rover Evoque Coquelin-a custom Range Rover Sport Chamber-Audi q5 Wilshere-Mercedes G-Wagen Steve Bould-a regular citroen, probably supplied by the club Mertesacker-also saw him in a regular citroen Bellerin-he drove a lambo, although rented Flamini-an older model of Range Rover Vogue Some players have drivers take them (I saw Arteta and Ozil leave like that). Some stay a bit longer after the match to eat something or chat with friends or family. Don't get your hopes up on getting something signed, as you will be crushed by all the people pushing the cars of the players. Most of them refuse to sign, although some are nice and sign a couple. Talk to the stewards after the game and they will tell you more details. Wenger rarely leaves early. He usually stays after the match, watches the replay, makes plans and at the end of the day, when they are required to close the stadium, he leaves. Some stewards working there say he takes a short nap after games. I saw giroud, tried to persuade him to sign my scarf, he told me to fuck off. I tore my jeans earlier that day as I tried running after Alexis' car with lots of other fans and I tripped and fell pretty bad. The good thing was that after everyone left, I met Jason Sudiekis as he was leaving the stadium with the entire SNL crew. We chatted for a couple of minutes, took a picture, then partes ways. There are lots of famous people coming to matches. You just need to wait after the match."

Second of all we were dominating the game and it looked as though the players were going to play their own way with courage rather than the Trapatoni shitball we were playing.

Gunners,3dwhin,HerbertChapmansGhost,69,Mon Jul 20 11:51:05 2015 UTC,Such a beast for his country
Gunners,3dwhin,TheVault77Dweller,7,Mon Jul 20 12:47:23 2015 UTC,Just a shame he hasn't been able to turn it on for us. Hopefully this season something will click for him.
Gunners,3dwhin,AndysDoughnuts,11,Mon Jul 20 15:23:09 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with being able to turn it on, he's simply useless against good defenders. Same reason Gervinho was good in France but useless in England."
Gunners,3dwhin,snozberrydriveby,10,Mon Jul 20 03:13:08 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your assessment of Gervinho here.  In my eyes, Gervinho's struggles were all about confidence and composure. He was so frustrating because he'd do everything right up until that final ball or that final shot.  Obviously the caliber of defender has some bearing on a players confidence, but his ability before that final ball makes me think that they weren't the problem.  Perhaps this is all the same for Campbell?"
Gunners,3dwhin,jniko,2,Mon Jul 20 10:06:35 2015 UTC,"Gervinho wouldn't do everything right until the final ball or shot and had plenty of other problems on the flanks - Wenger has proven that he's more than willing to let a player stay in the team if they don't finish well as long as they do everything else well, which should say something for both of these player. In Gervinho's case, he was phenomenal when a defender committed to him or was static and struggled incredibly when a defender simply moved with him and cut off his options, which is why he would so often simply run out of the by-line. In France and against the poorer CL clubs, he'd dominate simply because defenders didn't make him make the choice and he'd use his athleticism, but he got no such luxury in England or Italy (where defenses are more structured) and he's being run out of his second club in 3 years because of it.   Campbell looks phenomenal for his international team because CONCACAF is horrible and International teams as a whole aren't great at defending. There's also the minor problem in that Campbell also just isn't a good passer, so he'll never fit into our side."
Gunners,3dwhin,snozberrydriveby,2,Mon Jul 20 14:29:08 2015 UTC,"I can't understand this opinion at all. He was extremely quick and had good balance, and those were his only qualities. His ball control was so poor that his only reliable move was to come to a complete stop and make it about who had the fastest first step, which made his touch irrelevant. He was so athletic he could create chances with this, but because he's not good, nothing came of them.  To me he didn't look like an arsenal player at any point of his stint with us, the vision and technical skills especially. When was the last time we signed such a poor passing attacking player?"
Gunners,3dwhin,Wheat-Thins,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:15:00 2015 UTC,"He played against Uruguay, Italy, England, Greece and the Netherlands at the World Cup where everyone took notice of him. Are you saying none of those teams have good defenders? It was all just a flook that he did so well?  Personally I think it's more of a confidence/passion thing."
Gunners,3dwhin,AndysDoughnuts,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:21:58 2015 UTC,"I'm saying exactly what I said previously - organized defense is harder on the international stage. Besides, Italy is the only team on there that actually has a legitimately good defense. England's is overrated, Greece has been living off of it's Euro reputation for almost a decade, Uruguay was massively under-performing, and the Dutch have been trying to outscore opponents because they can't defend for years now.   Campbell couldn't even score at Villareal and had a poor record on Olympiakos. In fact, he has 18 non-international goals in 142 appearances; at a certain point, the people touting ""It's a confidence thing!"" might just want to accept that he's not very good and his international career is largely because he generally plays poor competition."
Gunners,3dwhin,snozberrydriveby,2,Mon Jul 20 20:20:01 2015 UTC,"Just a shame he hasn't been able to turn it on for us.   F this the dude never got a run of games in the first team. He was deemed ""not good enough"" based on training alone, which I thought was a shame"
Gunners,3dwhin,seppin,3,Mon Jul 20 19:56:28 2015 UTC,"And being embarrassingly poor in the limited games he's got. It may be harsh, but when you get a chance you need to take it"
Gunners,3dwhin,Moyeslestable,2,Mon Jul 20 21:10:59 2015 UTC,He got like 3 appearances over 3 months. Alexis could barely pass the ball straight in his first 3 appearances. Giroud was poor his whole first season. Ramsey has had 6 month periods of being awful in the past. A tiny sample size doesn't mean anything.
Gunners,3dwhin,Wheat-Thins,0,Mon Jul 20 17:03:21 2015 UTC,"If you don't impress enough in training to win a place, when you do get a chance you waste it, and you have no proven pedigree that demands a fair run, you aren't going to succeed at a club like Arsenal. He's 23, older than Gnabry or the Ox, he has to show something very soon.  Let's get real, comparing Campbell to a massive signing, our only option up front at the time, and a player who displayed his vast potential at just 17 is just silly"
Gunners,3dwhin,Moyeslestable,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:12:26 2015 UTC,"He was unremarkable, but ""embarrassingly poor"" is a ridiculous overstatement. Either we're a club that gives young talent a chance or we aren't."
Gunners,3dwhin,seppin,0,Mon Jul 20 21:50:32 2015 UTC,"He was embarrassing against Southampton, that's for sure. He's 23, he's not young talent, he needs to perform. What we need to be doing is giving Gnabry and Ox that game time."
Gunners,3dwhin,Moyeslestable,-7,Mon Jul 20 23:58:07 2015 UTC,He was good for one game in the 2014 WC and average for the rest of the tournament. People really didn't watch him play did they?

Gunners,3dwhin,JMaboard,6,Mon Jul 20 11:50:48 2015 UTC,Completely agree he was great in his first match and after that he was just average.
Gunners,3dwhin,newbridger,-1,Mon Jul 20 12:37:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  On the contrary and despite not scoring many, he was Villarreal's best player during the latter part of last season(when Vietto, Santos's and Cheryshev were all missing)."

Gunners,3dwhin,jubbing,-1,Mon Jul 20 07:49:43 2015 UTC,"He really reminds me of Bale at a similar stage in his career. Capable of regularly producing some incredible things, but sometimes inconsistent with the end-product.   I may be biased, but I want Wenger to try him out in a central striker role."

Gunners,3dwhin,lojafr,13,Mon Jul 20 07:13:07 2015 UTC,ok. for the most part he was played in the deeper midfield role he didn't do badly and he didn't shine either-   Villereal were stacked with attacking players already - the only reason we loaned him there instead of somewhere else is the fact that we got Gabbi

Gunners,3dwhin,Assmar,7,Mon Jul 20 11:21:32 2015 UTC,"This is a microcosm of Joel Campbell.  He can make runs like this, but he's just far too inconsistent, even for Costa Rica."

Gunners,3dwhin,yankonthis,2,Mon Jul 20 23:58:43 2015 UTC,Because for some reason his teammate decided to chill right in his way and in an offside position instead of retreating across goal and giving him a pass or pulling a CB away.

Gunners,3dxr4a,StephoColeman,104,Mon Jul 20 12:10:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you for not posting the link to the title. Begovic isn't anywhere near Cech's level, hence why he has been bought as a back-up keeper to Courtois. He would not have been an upgrade on what we already have. I'd rather have 5 years of Petr Cech than 10 years of Begovic."
Gunners,3dxr4a,MiyagiSanDanielSan,31,Mon Jul 20 12:14:46 2015 UTC,"I know we're not fans of the Daily Fail, here.  Also, is 33 not a good age for a goalkeeper? Look at Van Der Saar, one of the best goalkeepers of the Prem. He transferred to United at about the same age & went on to have incredibly successful years. Cech is an incredible keeper, and I don't see him declining for another few years. It also allows us to continue to develop Szczesny."
Gunners,3dxr4a,knanzo,9,Mon Jul 20 12:18:00 2015 UTC,"Lehmann's first season with us was the Invincibles season, and he was 33 at the time"

In fact, Lehmann won the UEFA best keeper award at 36 years old if I remember correctly.  Granted both Lehmann and Kahn are sort of pretty decent keepers to say the least, many goalkeepers will stay great well into their thirties. With this in mind, I have no worries about Cech being 33."

Gunners,3dxr4a,MiyagiSanDanielSan,6,Tue Jul 21 02:30:53 2015 UTC,"Exactly. 33 to a Goalkeeper is probably about 28 to an outfield player.  He has plenty of time left in his career, and many world-class keepers tend to stay on top deep into their 30s with Van Der Saar being a prime example."

People of 'experience' like to put down those who do well. Its normal. We are competitive. Players are over rated today no matter who they are. Cech is the closest we have had to a real, honest, spit and sawdust keeper in a very very long time. Whether he is better or not than Begovic is not important.

Gunners,3dxr4a,johnyann,2,Mon Jul 20 18:30:57 2015 UTC,"He looked pretty fucking good against Everton...  Begovic is no doubt a good keeper, but he isn't world class like Petr is.  Plus keepers don't really drop off until the age of ""I'm fucking sick of playing football and traveling and shit"""
Gunners,3dxr4a,hangaram,2,Mon Jul 20 20:09:39 2015 UTC,"Begovic is totally overrated GK. I don't think he could be a No.1 GK in top 4.  Honestly, if we want to get him, I'm sure we get him to our team in last year.  I really have a doubt about his ball handling skill."

Gunners,3dxr4a,pirate-santa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:38:30 2015 UTC,Begovic at 28 hardly has age on his side to be top quality for 15 years. Cech is definitely a better keeper and at 33 has good experience and at least 5 good years ahead of him. A bit hypocritical of James who arguably was at his best when he was 39/40 or so for Portsmouth to argue someone a class above him at 33 wouldn't be capable of improving in his 30s. Van Der sar is another example. 35 moved to Man U and retired when still arguably able to play another couple years.
Gunners,3dxr4a,Jdog2010,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:06:33 2015 UTC,"The only reasoning that I can think of for this is that Begovic is five years younger and would probably have come for about half the price.  But still, while Begovic is good, Cech is MUCH better.  Well worth the extra money.  And he is a ""win now"" buy, which I love.  He's got 3-5 good years left in him, and hopefully by the time he leaves Szczesny will be ready to take over (yes, I still have faith in our Pole)."

I wanted him a few years ago but he seems to have declined too. Cech is a champion, won everything at Chelsea, Begovic has been at stoke infront of midtable players, stupid comments.  Also James is a fraud, only reason he got into the 2010 wc team is because England had really shit keepers around that time."

I'm still not convinced Cech is as good a keeper we like to think he is, Begovic might be better, but he certainly brings that experience and leadership that our defence need the coming years if we want challenge for the title. That is why Wenger went and overpaid for a 33 year old Petr Cech."
Gunners,3dxr4a,Sayek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:16:00 2015 UTC,"leadership that our defence needs   I think Cech has a lot of qualities and he is an excellent keeper. However I don't see him as a leader of the defense. He might bring more experience to the defenders and talk with them on the training field about what he wants them to do etc but as far as a leader on the pitch, I don't think that's really him or why we signed him."

Gunners,3dvjc2,Jawnt,37,Sun Jul 19 21:50:16 2015 UTC,The club's come a long way since the 7-3 against Newcastle when everyone thought it was a sinking ship and Theo was off to Chelsea.
Gunners,3dvjc2,DildoSwagginz69,16,Sun Jul 19 22:47:29 2015 UTC,or that 7-5 against reading. down 4-1 at half time. ugh..
Gunners,3dvjc2,jamestan14,22,Mon Jul 20 01:04:52 2015 UTC,Yeah but that ended up being one of the most exciting games ever. I remember I was in art history class streaming the game and holding everything in my body to keep from visibly freaking out
Gunners,3dvjc2,blockdmyownshot,-2,Mon Jul 20 01:14:49 2015 UTC,Yeah but that was the Capital One Cup. We had a lot of subs in and it wouldn't of been a huge deal had we lost.
Gunners,3dvjc2,G-BreadMan,82,Mon Jul 20 07:24:50 2015 UTC,It's great to see players putting in more faith in team than their own personal interests. Credit goes to Wenger!

Gunners,3dvjc2,HenrysRightFoot,74,Sun Jul 19 23:43:23 2015 UTC,I think Delph really traumatized everyone this week lol
Gunners,3dvjc2,Ross5512,6,Sun Jul 19 23:54:19 2015 UTC,"There is a team behind a high profile player, making sure to maximize wages. If that's at city, they'll tell him to go to city."

Gunners,3dvjc2,ss33o23,11,Mon Jul 20 14:57:34 2015 UTC,I'm not really traumatized per se. I'm just being realistic. This is their job and any one of us would leave for another company if they offered us more money.
Gunners,3dvjc2,HenrysRightFoot,38,Mon Jul 20 00:29:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's definitely not some universal fact that can be thrown around."
Gunners,3dvjc2,b-hayes,6,Mon Jul 20 00:38:06 2015 UTC,Well I mean there are always circumstances that might make this untrue but as a generality it works.
Gunners,3dvjc2,HenrysRightFoot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:39:05 2015 UTC,"It only works as a generality because most people work for low money at low skill jobs.  When you are a highly skilled expert other things start to matter.  That's why players often take pay cuts to join a champions league club.  Look at the wages Real Madrid plays their squad players.  These players could be paid a lot more at other clubs, but the prospect of winning major trophies at Madrid keeps them happy there."
Gunners,3dvjc2,immerc,6,Tue Jul 21 12:07:51 2015 UTC,Money is a big factor. Now none of us can really empathize with their pay grades. But I can at least understand it in principle. It's the main reason my current employer will lose me as an employee eventually

Gunners,3dvjc2,vyrusrama,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:09:23 2015 UTC,Well I can realize it is a business and resent the shit out of someone at the same time. We may love the club but to these guys they are their employer. They might love the club too but they aren't going to put the club above themselves in most cases. Just like I probably wouldn't at my job. Also RvP was our most important player and captain. The club doesn't fall apart if theo goes like it might have with RvP. Also I prefer to call him Robin van Pussy. Not to stir up a truly unnecessary fight.

Gunners,3dvjc2,immerc,-3,Tue Jul 21 12:02:20 2015 UTC,"Delph was playing for fucking Villa, of course he's going to want out."
Gunners,3dvjc2,DTGG,2,Mon Jul 20 10:09:08 2015 UTC,"I agree. If he was 100% committed, I doubt it would have taken this long. He has been most likely keeping his options open to get the best deal he could, but those options are running out for now.  City chose Sterling so it's unlikely they will be in for him this season at least. Liverpool probably can't give him anything more than a guaranteed starting spot. If Pedro becomes available, United / Chelsea will probably look in that direction. Besides, he might not fancy riding the bench at Chelsea too much."
Gunners,3dvjc2,Ygqk,6,Mon Jul 20 01:58:03 2015 UTC,"The full text from this interview doesn't paint such a positive picture, with Theo saying ""If it happens, it happens"""
Gunners,3dvjc2,bonuscheese,4,Mon Jul 20 04:26:29 2015 UTC,Implying that his paycheck isn't a personal interest. Don't pretend that Theo would stick around if he didn't feel he was getting paid enough.

Gunners,3dvjc2,d_smogh,25,Tue Jul 21 18:26:14 2015 UTC,He's just one of those players that listens to whatever his agent tells him. His agent appears to be particularly difficult.
Gunners,3dvjc2,RyanLikesyoface,12,Sun Jul 19 22:19:10 2015 UTC,A poster on another forum that knows of Theo's agent (through his brother) claims that she is rather thick and is going into the negotiations like it's still 2012 and Theo has all the cards.
Gunners,3dvjc2,the_tytan,14,Mon Jul 20 00:32:24 2015 UTC,He definitely doesn't hold the same bargaining position he had back then.
Gunners,3dvjc2,-Indeed-,4,Mon Jul 20 02:02:11 2015 UTC,"I have no idea if the agreement is basically complete, or broken down, or what, but Theo does indeed have bargaining power because he's 'homegrown', a proven goal-scorer in the PL, a sponsor's dream, and will be able to leave free next summer and cash in for some serious money for a PL rival next season. If Arsenal are prepared to let him walk for free and miss out on millions in transfer fees, then he has no bargaining power, otherwise, they'll want to get this sorted this summer, or before January at the latest."
Gunners,3dvjc2,Searocksandtrees,12,Mon Jul 20 02:28:46 2015 UTC,"I never said he didnt have bargaining power, just that his position is different from 2012."
Gunners,3dvjc2,-Indeed-,3,Mon Jul 20 02:42:41 2015 UTC,"Yes it was very different from 2012. Arsenal have come a long way since then, Theo - not so much."
Gunners,3dvjc2,spn150230,3,Mon Jul 20 05:08:28 2015 UTC,"His bargaining power has decreased tremendously since 2012, though.  Then he was top scorer and Arsenal absolutely had to keep him after RvP and Cesc left.  Now, he's not even an automatic pick for the first 11.  And, the squad also has some wiggle room with 'homegrown' players.  To be clear, I really want Theo to stay.  But if his agent thinks they have Wenger over a barrel like in 2012 then this could/will drag on for awhile."

Gunners,3dvjc2,HeWhoDares-,11,Sun Jul 19 21:50:52 2015 UTC,"Look, all the signs are there- Wenger comes and says that his future is at CF...then starts him at CF on the last day of the season where he bags a hat trick...then starts him over Giroud, who'd been starting all year long, in the FA Cup final where he scores the opening goal.   Since then Walcott has done nothing but talk up the club and his teammates while training hard. We know that Wenger is not going to spend £25M on a CF who isn't clearly on par with/better than Welbeck/Walcott/Giroud, so the odds that we sign another CF are slim.   Theo wants to play CF and he's going to get that. He knows the time is right for Arsenal to take the next step and he wants to be a part of it, not leave now like so many before him. Wenger believes he can and will be a really good CF, so everyone is on the same page. Y'all chill. It's done."
Gunners,3dvjc2,G00Punch,29,Mon Jul 20 04:05:02 2015 UTC,"Well, pretty much confirms that theo isn't going anywhere. He's pretty level headed and trusts his agent to get him the right deal. He's not the type to rush contract negotiations. He looked really good in the Everton game. Can't wait to see what a fully fit Theo can do with a quality team around him during his prime years. In a way, we've been waiting a decade to see just how good theo can be and I think we'll see that in the upcoming season, if injuries allow."
Gunners,3dvjc2,Practice4Me,17,Sun Jul 19 22:22:39 2015 UTC,"Fit Theo will scare the crap out of defenders. I can't wait to see him in action. I wonder, though, if Wenger will do the not-play-Theo-at-RW-with-Bellerin thing again this season."
Gunners,3dvjc2,arsenalfc1987,20,Sun Jul 19 22:38:20 2015 UTC,"The Everton game presented them with something that was interesting. Who do you mark, the slow but aerial Giroud or the Flash? The defenders stuck with Giroud and Theo torched then for speed."
Gunners,3dvjc2,FrozenFlamethrower,6,Sun Jul 19 23:31:14 2015 UTC,I agree! It was nice to see. We're quite multi-dimensional now. I am beyond stoked for this season.
Gunners,3dvjc2,trythebry,4,Mon Jul 20 00:11:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think Theo tracks back enough on the right for us to play him with Bellerin. Sagna was generally ok by himself and maybe some midfield cover so I expect Debuchy to do the same. If Debuchy is healthy, I think we'll see a lot of Theo wide and have a dilemma through the middle, with Santi, Rambo, and Jack all probably their best in the the spot next to Coquelin."
Gunners,3dvjc2,not-who-you-think,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:10:45 2015 UTC,"I think Wilshere can play the Santi role. Ramsey is a much different player. Not that you can't play him with Coq but it'll mean a tactical shift, like if we start Theo at striker instead of Giroud."
Gunners,3dvjc2,wooly1987,4,Mon Jul 20 03:31:42 2015 UTC,He looked really good in the Everton game.   Is it just me or does it seem like he always plays his best football in the weeks leading up to a new contract?

Gunners,3dvjc2,jackw_,3,Tue Jul 21 00:58:20 2015 UTC,"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant news. Made my day.   Theo is an ambitious guy, and no way he was going to give up playing for THIS Arsenal team - with Ozil, Sanchez, Cazorla - just to have an easy ride at a mid-table club like Liverpool. I have always had huge faith in him and I hope we see him ripping up the Premier league for years to come for The Arsenal."
Gunners,3dvjc2,uselessrightfoot,3,Sun Jul 19 22:24:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't read too much into it, it's a pretty standard PR stance, Theo seems happy but I do worry that if we call his bluff he might just leave, he'd have plenty of takers next Summer for free. If Man City paid 50m for Sterling, plus big wages, imagine what they'd pay to Theo on a Bosman.  We've won the brinksmanhip games up to this point though, so I'm fairly sanguine."

Gunners,3dvjc2,SlovenlyRed,2,Mon Jul 20 06:35:08 2015 UTC,"The team could wait for (a) the deal to be finalised (b) they're back in London (c) they want to announce several at once (doesn't seem likely in this case)  I like that site too, but it's possible they got wrong information, or misunderstood the status (e.g. thought it was done, whereas maybe there's only an agreement in principle, or there was an agreement but something changed).. I don't get the impression from them that they extrapolate irresponsibly or write click bait, but they clearly jumped the gun on this one: it's clear from Walcott's statements that it's not done yet"

Gunners,3dvjc2,Tubmas,2,Sun Jul 19 23:38:44 2015 UTC,"So I'm confused, when he wasn't signing before because he wanted more money we were all cool with not re-signing him because he hadn't earned it and still has major injury issues.  Now he's started 3 games and he still wants more than 100k and we think he's going to settle for anything less?  I mean I would love to keep him, but I don't see how anything has changed in the last 3 months. This is the exact statement you are supposed to say to keep the fans loving you. Thankfully for him Arsenal aren't like Liverpool and drag him under a bus like they did with Sterling.  If he sticks with his 100k then let's keep him, but if he wants 120k has he earned it? Can Aubameyang bring the same if not more to the table at a lower salary?  Without Theo or anyone else coming in we are looking at Alexis, Ox, Welbeck, Gnabry, Akpom (he will play the wing some games), Wilshere. Great names that we love, but only Alexis is going to bring in guaranteed goals so that's why I see Wenger bringing in someone else. He's just waiting to see how the Walcott situation plays out."
Gunners,3dvjc2,MrAlmostWrong,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:27:56 2015 UTC,"You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Pay the kid what he wants. He doesn't guarantee goals? You forget that in his last full season he had 20+ goals and 10+ assists and was our top scorer? People will never admit it, but he's almost as good as Alexis, and his finishing and speed are  certainly better. Comparing him to Aubameyang is insulting and goes to show how either myopically daft you are, or you just started watching. Before his injury, he was in stupendous form, after, he hasn't don't much wrong other than fail to get into a squad that was playing amazingly well. If he wants par or close to it with Özil and Alexis, so what? He's earned it, and will prove it over and over in the future."
Gunners,3dvjc2,EFG,0,Mon Jul 20 14:37:09 2015 UTC,"Ah so this is how mods treat people. Sweet. But hey let's run with what you said here...  When did I say he doesn't guarantee goals? I did say without Theo the only winger that guarantee goals is Alexis. His finishing is better than Alexis? That's pushing it. Theo is great at the goals inside of the penalty area and I think he's scored one header his whole career. Alexis scores from all over the pitch.  Comparing him to Aubameyang is a perfectly legit comparison because of their skillsets. Theo heavily relies on his runs to create space. Rarely does he try to take anyone on with the ball while Aubameyang can do just that.  In his last four seasons Aubameyang has scored 18, 21, 16, 26 goals (81 total goals). Since 2005 Theo has scored a total of 81 goals in all competitions. So you're right, comparing them at the moment is insulting because Aubameyang has produced more over the years.  But Theo has been injured! Exactly. Theo is always injured in some capacity. We've already paid Diaby for always being unavailable, why do we want to pay Theo top coin when he hasn't proven he can last a whole season?  He isn't on the international level of Özil or Alexis. Hell, he doesn't even shine for England, but now it's okay to pay him on par with those two? He hasn't earned anything. What has earned him a raise since he signed his contract two years ago?  We deride Lacazette for having one breakout season, why doesn't Theo get the same treatment? One season where he scored more than 20 goals (the next two highest totals are 13 and 11) and now it's going to be impossible to replicate his numbers if we lose him?  But I'm the daft one. Again I'm all for paying him 100k or maybe even 110k, but jumping up to 120k+? Nah."

Gunners,3dxj21,BeansforHomerclese,7,Mon Jul 20 12:03:58 2015 UTC,"so no-one is answering your question. Here's what I would do:    read the article very closely for mentions of sources (e.g. ""according to the Metro"" or ""sources in Turkey"" or whatever) then find them. If they say they got it from the Metro, then go to the Metro's site and run a search for Sturridge stories. Or run a google search where you specify the site, e.g. ""sturridge arsenal site:metro.co.uk"". If you can't find it, the source claim could be bs. If you do find it, repeat: see what their source is. Your ultimate goal is to find the original interview. if no source is mentioned, but they give quotes, you can google some keywords in the quote to track it back. Not in this case, but generally speaking many/most quotes come from press conferences, so the original is likely a video, but you can eventually find those, especially in the case of Arsenal: every pre- and post-match press conference and many post-match player interviews are posted on player.arsenal.com. Reporters do also get additional interviews with players, and some of those are taped and uploaded. Again, use google, but this time you don't know the site, but you can specify a date range on your search settings. So you'd be looking for articles within the last, say, month or two. For more generic stuff, start on player.arsenal.com (original videos) and arsenal.com (text transcriptions.. some interviews are posted in video form), or google ""arteta interview"" with a date range; definitely try a video search.  In the case of this story, there are no direct quotes, and we don't realistically expect to find a video of this interview, but there are some keywords you could look for like ""sturridge arsenal steve rowley third choice"", and specify the date range on the google search options. If nothing turns up, consider whether the quote is genuine, hearsay, a misquote, or complete bs. if no sources and no quotes are given, then you've seriously got to question this story: is it being given in good faith, or is it just clickbaity garbage? Some indicators will be the quality/reputation of the site (Daily Mail? some blog? probably garbage), reputation of the author (some columnists have very good reputations), whether the article has been signed by the author (and not using some blog handle, although some bloggers do build up a solid reputation - see previous point), the language used (does the source/article expect to be taken seriously by intelligent people, or is it just some kid shooting their mouth off, or basically entertainment.. tipoff here is the clickbaity title ""SHOCK MOVE TO ARSENAL"").    My quick judgement based on this single article, it's dramatic title, subtitle (complete with exclamation point), short/emotional/opinion-based content, lack of sources, on a blog site, signed using a blog handle is that this is more likely pageview clickbait written by some kid than anything serious. I've never seen this site, nor have I tried to source anything in the story, so who knows, but based on first impressions, it doesn't seem worth the effort."
Gunners,3dxj21,Searocksandtrees,3,Mon Jul 20 19:06:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks, tried all your methods - unfortunately it looks like pure clickbait.  I was hoping it was a BS story inspired by a 1 liner from an actual interview with Steve Rowley, but it now appears they just made the whole thing up."
Gunners,3dxj21,Searocksandtrees,3,Tue Jul 21 02:38:18 2015 UTC,":) yeah who knows. Would be difficult to find an interview with a scout (not the sort of thing they do often.. although I believe I've heard a scout on a podcast) and would be extremely surprising if a scout employed by a club spilled that kind of information (could be a quick ticket out of a job), but anything is possible: people slip up sometimes, or he might have told a friend in confidence who spilled it to the blogger... those sort of ITKs that rat on inside information are a real pain to the club/players.  But as I say, an article like this puts up enough red flags that it's not really worth the effort: if the story has anything to it, it will come up again from a better source eventually."

Really not interested anyone ""playing manager/boardmember"", nor in their opinion unless they are truly top-notch journalists/analysts (e.g. I keep an eye out for Philipe Auclair on podcasts). Basically try to keep the hysteria level to a minimum, and focus on trying to understand what's actually going on (Gazidis is great for that actually, also Wenger in longer-format interviews) and learn something"

Gunners,3dxj21,MrStigglesworth,4,Mon Jul 20 12:10:33 2015 UTC,"I don't see why Liverpool would buy Benteke only to create another lack of depth in selling Sturridge. Benteke would be primarily used as an alternative to Sturridge you would assume. They bring different but equally valuable skills to their squad. Plus Sturridge is rather injury prone.  I think that fans overvalue the fact that players ""support"" a team as a factor. It's their career and they go where they can get the best deal. I don't question whether Sturridge would move to us (because Champions League) but I think it still boils down to the only real question - why would Liverpool want to sell him?"

I only have Fifa 14 so I don't know if they changed that in 15 but players who have a very low stamina meter play almost exactly the same as in the start of the match when their stamina meter is full. They can do the same sprints and stuff regardless of how ""tired"" they are. It's not very realistic. I think that's something that the devs should really work on for the next game."

There's a significant majority of fucktards who call themselves Gooners, who are just waiting for Wenger to slip up before they bring up the WengerOut bandwagon.  I'm a die hard Gooner, and whilst we all want success, we are in no way entitled to it. We've never won a Champs League, and Wenger is the guy who brought us closest to it. We'd never won the league in the fashion we did under his teams - both from a statistical perspective and a style of play perspective. We've finished on average higher under his reign (including the 9 barren years) than we ever did under any other manager. He's overseen the club moving into a new financial territory, a gigantic, modern, and elegant stadium in the centre of London.  Criticism is fine and warranted at times (like why didn't we buy an additional CB last summer), but go fuck yourself if you have the audacity to ask for such a legend of a manager's head via a hashtag.

If you look at the demographic of those who disagree with Wenger, in my experience it tends to be the supporters who are older- chiefly those whose love for Arsenal predates Arsene. I'll never seek to defend the Stoke away incident as it was totally abhorrent, but not liking Arsene doesn't make you any less of an Arsenal fan. Personally I can't imagine the club without him, but like most of this sub I'm young and Arsene is all I know"
Gunners,3dvh40,gnarlsscrott,7,Mon Jul 20 09:30:19 2015 UTC,"I've been following Arsenal since like the year 2000 give or take. I have huge respect, love and admiration for Arsene, who he is, and what he has accomplished.   Does that mean I don't get to consider the possibility that he might not be the right man for the job at the moment? Note that I'm not saying I believe that. But if I did, would I really be that much of a fucktard just because I might consider what Arsenal might be like without him? I don't think so.  And more to the point, I really don't think it' healthy for someone in the position that Ivan Gazidis is in to be saying Wenger can stay another 10 years if he wants. You don't need to be a reactionary to understand that people need to know their job is under some form of scrutiny, otherwise you can far more easily reach a point where you care less and less.  Fully expecting the downvotes, considering how batshit unreasonable most people are on this sub."

Gunners,3dvh40,Brozay89,3,Mon Jul 20 01:54:58 2015 UTC,"It's fine - that's your opinion and constructive criticism is always welcome.  My issue with a lot of people who want to replace Wenger is that they wait until the team slips up before voicing any opinion. The ones who want Wenger to stay stick with him through thick and thin, whereas those hash tagging Wenger Out only emerge after a loss.  It makes our entire fan base a laughing stock. Why not just say, I back the manager until the end of his contract/end of the season, than kicking up a fuss mid season? (I'm not saying you do that, I don't know personally about you, but I'm talking about the legions online).  By the way - I disagree with your point on stability. Wenger whilst well remunerated by Arsenal, is definitely not in it for the money. If anything, knowing he can stay for 10 years is something that makes him feel even more in charge of the club. We forget that he's been approached endless times by Florentino Perez for RM,and even PSG in 2014. If he wanted immediate trophies and success, he'd be gone."
Gunners,3dvh40,interstellar1990,2,Mon Jul 20 09:17:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly - I had a ""Wenger is past it"" flair for the last year and, even though we are definitely doing much better now than we were then, I still believe that we need a better tactitian than Arsene to push us to the very top. I absolutely love the man, I shed tears when I saw him lift the cup, but I think his strength as a manager lies in transfers and economic management, not leading games ANYMORE. He is the only one who could have taken us through the transition period from Highbury, but we need someone with different strengths now to fully ultilise our new assets. Wenger used to have new ideas 15 years ago which changed the entire game, but everyone knows him well now and I feel we lack the surprise factor...  Anyway, the point is I stuck with my opinion even after us winning a major trophy and I received so much hatred here that I couldn't even post stuff anymore. Wenger supporters (not the exact term, I support him 100% and always will, but you know what I mean) can be just as ignorant as the WOB (again, not something I feel a part of)."
Gunners,3dvh40,legop4o,2,Mon Jul 20 13:46:40 2015 UTC,"That's fair enough though. I respect your opinion but disagree.  I think he's just not had the type of players at his disposal to play the type of football he wants. We were utterly dominant when he was allowed to build his team, his way. I think post the trophy drought years, he deserves until the end of his 3 year contract to show us what sort of team he wants to build and how he wants us to play."

What about Herbert Chapman. Don't sell the club short in some respects. That said I agree with your feelings on the Wenger out crowd, you only have to read something like Tim Stillman's collumn or 7amkickoff to understand that football is so much more tactically complicated than what the fans see."

You think Arsenal is going to release a statement that says 'Yeah Wenger was fucking the shit out of that broad'? You think Wenger is going to admit it?  Googling brings up photos of them together, statements from Wenger that I brought up earlier and a statement from Arsenal saying they were standing behind Wenger in the situation. No denials.

Gunners,3dvh40,coldblood11,12,Sun Jul 19 22:01:13 2015 UTC,"In general Liverpool-fans seem to respect Wenger a lot more than most other sets of fans. Judging by /r/soccer and especially Chelsea-supporters they even seem to think he is a fraud. Although that might be some brainwash from their short-sigted manager to a fan-base that didn't know football existed until 2005.  Back to Liverpool they could use some inspiration from our way of doing things to get back. And I think the top 4-ship for next season has sailed, but by buying younger players they might hit form in a season to oust and even older City-side. Could see Man United falling short this season, though. Come back in 10 months and tell me how right I am."

Gunners,3dvh40,Practice4Me,13,Mon Jul 20 01:43:06 2015 UTC,"I, too, dislike the Wenger out crowd. In my opinion they are just a vocal minority that want the manager to be someone as accomplished as Ferguson or Shankly despite the fact that Wenger has had numerous constraints that made it nearly impossible to find as many trophies as the likes of Ferguson. It's kind of a shame that Wenger time in the premier League coincided with Ferguson because, lIke it or not, managers are rated by their trophy count not their life savings. I think he'd be much more recognized as a great manager if people never compared him to the contemporaneous trophy grabbing success of Ferguson, especially considering the financial restraints Wenger had. I do think history will always acknowledge how capably Arsene modernized Arsenal but I hope the Wenger out crowd is given a dark unacknowledged corner in that particular retelling. I have a feeling they'll be given a far larger space in this little history than they actually took up."
Gunners,3dvh40,beauchard,11,Sun Jul 19 22:46:35 2015 UTC,"Wenger Out Brigade will be forgotten footnotes of AFC history in due time. Because even the most vocal member of that party deep down realize that Wenger has been the absolute best thing for Arsenal FC since maybe Herbert Chapman. And his intense scrutiny has come about due to his own unparalleled success at the start of his tenure.   I was doing the math the other day, AFC in our illustrious history have won the title oh about every 7 years. And Wenger is par on that trajectory due to his periodic wins around the millenia (3 in 20.) Now is the time to keep it rolling.   The WOB thinking that just by changing a manager we will win the league shows their immaturity on the face of concrete evidences like the simple case of the managerial succession of SAF himself, or even the 13/14 return of the horse with the inferiority complex, Mou. Success is anything but guaranteed, it has to be built (or bought as it sometimes may be the case.) It is a valid concern that Wenger might not again win the league, but it is just that: a concern not a certainty. IMO Wenger is more likely to win the league for us than any other manager. The squad is finally coming to the fore, to prove our faith.   Between SAF and Arsene, one is a greater manager the other is a greater man. The hypotheticals like what if they managed the same squad who'd do better, or how'd SAF do if he was in Arsene's situation or vice versa, or what if Arsene left for Bayern, or Barca or RM, are just for theoretical proceedings. What we have to contend with are the records. In reality, the financial restraints, the injury epidemic are just small part of the story. In our case, it was always like the david vs goliath story, except what you'd expect to happen, happened. David lost the stamina as the race went on. Wenger always had our squad punching above their weight. We all knew if all things went right our squad throughout the period were capable of upsets, but the things didn't always go right in the short term. And his long term plans were stifled time and again when players around whom the plans were made left. Still he had us performing to the level of the champions. Others will judge SAF the better manager and we can't deny that. But Arsene will always be the better manager for me, for what he has done for the club, how much he has sacrificed and how much he has put into the club day in day out tirelessly.  Also I don't blame anyone that has doubts. We all know exactly why it is there. We all share the concerns and we all share the heartbreaks. But the twats I call WOB are those who have disrespected the manager and act beneath the level of Gooners around the world. Reminds me of the Bertrand Russell quote   The fundamental cause of trouble in the world today is that the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.   We know nothing is bigger than the Arsenal Football Club. But in Arsenal Football Club no one is bigger than Arsene Wenger. Regardless of how passionate the WOB think they are or how much they claim that they speak for the club, they don't. Wenger does. AFC will go on after Wenger, but Wenger won't go on without AFC. And as long as I can have Wenger, I will happily trudge along regardless of what may follow. Regardless of what self entitled twat like pierce morgan say, who have no decency to admit when they are wrong, regardless of how other fans who have won nothing mock us about our lack of winning because it's an easy joke for the entire league or regardless of how a billionaire's launder operation or a brand of Chinese toilet paper accuse us of not spending money, I will follow on his prudent path of self-enrichment.   He's certainly not infallible, he's certainly not perfect. But of all people I expect him to improve year on end. And it's not that I don't want to win anything, it's that I want to win everything with him. And after our years of austerity, the climax is here. The crescendo of this story which has been building for the past ten years has reached its peak. We have arrived with our back2back cup runs. The race is set. And now the man who on his bare back has carried us year in year out amongst the elite of the European football will once and for all crown us the champions of the world, I believe.   In Arsène We Trust"

Gunners,3dvh40,isaidkneel,2,Mon Jul 20 00:31:23 2015 UTC,"outmoded. the modern approach to management involves shared responsibilities. It's a more efficient model that reduces errors, damaging behavior and conflicts of interests that usually occur as a result of control being left to a single person. There are checks and balances that make sure that no single entity has complete control over decisions and/or wields too much power, and forces cooperation in completing tasks. thats why in top clubs you dont see one man running the show.  wenger has certain talents, but our board made a tremendous error in deferring to Wenger in all football matters (presumably because of their own lack of footballing knowledge and vision) and allowing him to impose autocracy within the club"
Gunners,3dvh40,yarnaldo,5,Mon Jul 20 00:40:23 2015 UTC,"idk, I think at some point you have to realize that some men are a cut above. you're right, modern coaches are usually not in charge of personnel decisions, they are only in charge of the on field product, but the truly great coaches get complete power and thrive in it, a la Bill Belichick, Greg Popovich types, who I think are comparable to Wenger in resumes (decade and a half of dominance/success, several titles). A very select few are so on top of everything that they can do the entire job better alone, always steps ahead of the competition that nobody else can really keep up with."

Bill Belichick has been to 5 Superbowls in the past 10 seasons and won 3 of them.  Wenger hasn't placed above 3rd place in the PL in 10 years.   I don't think bringing other people into the fold for decision making would be the worst thing for Arsenal.

Those two coaches continue to win within their respected leagues, which warrants their final decision making within their team. If those coaches went a decade without winning anything substantial, something would change.   Some people have called it entitled to complain about only being in 3rd/4th place in the PL, given the quality of opposition. I disagree, I find that sort of attitude of complacency to be small club mentality, being happy to be there in the thick of it gives off a sense of lack of ambition and killer instinct to break through the glass ceiling.

Gunners,3dvh40,Freagle_q8,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:27:46 2015 UTC,And I can't imagine what will happen to us when he finally retires...
Gunners,3dvh40,isaidkneel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:35:49 2015 UTC,"He's built Arsenal into what it is today. The stadium, the global recognition, the super stars we've had grace our pitch, all of it is because of Wenger. The constant presence in the Champions League, the six FA cup victories, the double, an  unbeaten season. He's done everything and deserves every ounce of praise he receives."
Gunners,3dvh40,ohmahgurd,0,Mon Jul 20 10:26:03 2015 UTC,"Wow.  It took them to struggle as a club to finally understand how remarkable Arsene Wenger is.  Let's be honest, if Liverpool haven't struggled to get in the top 4, they would be bashing him.  With that said, it's refreshing to read opposing views of our management especially in a positive manner."
Gunners,3dvh40,Medfly70,-7,Sun Jul 19 23:43:43 2015 UTC,lol sheer delusion
Gunners,3dvh40,isaidkneel,-8,Sun Jul 19 23:44:32 2015 UTC,"If Arsene Wenger is a WC manager, he should be able to win this team at least one premier league trophy in the next three years. He now has the financial backing so he can't use that as an excuse anymore.  The squad rn is brilliant, it'd be a shame if he can't win something major with it."
Gunners,3dvh40,Medfly70,7,Sun Jul 19 22:30:35 2015 UTC,"As much money we have, we're still far behind a team that can spend a shit ton of money on a cuadrado just to have him sit on the bench."
Gunners,3dvh40,isaidkneel,-4,Sun Jul 19 22:56:15 2015 UTC,how long will fans continue to make excuses?
Gunners,3dvh40,Achilles07,3,Sun Jul 19 23:38:43 2015 UTC,It's not an excuse. It's a fact. As much as assholes want to throw in the fact that no trophy in 10 years in my face I'll throw those facts back in theirs.
Gunners,3dvh40,AnElegantPenis,3,Mon Jul 20 00:30:48 2015 UTC,"the point of contention is that wenger should be able to win the premier league within 3 years. is there is no instance in which wenger can receive any percentage of the blame if he fails to win the league within that time?   one would have hoped we'd have all put to bed the idea that success achieved is inherently proportional to money spent, especially after seeing what Atlético Madrid did in La Liga, having to compete with two of the biggest clubs in world football, who both have even more resources and world class players than either City or Chelsea.    if you are a world class manager, you should be able to punch above your weight or at least make it difficult for teams who are ""superior"" or spending more money. if you can only do as well as your resources allow, what benefits does the manager confer? the whole thing is such a tired argument. Fact is Wenger's management and tactics has been a bigger problem than the relative lack of spending. even now, the guy is now making optimal use of the funds made available, and no doubt we'll be left short in key areas by the time the window closes."
Gunners,3dvh40,KinkyGoat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:52:43 2015 UTC,"I see why you would say all these things, but I think your points are shortsighted and a generalized overview. Consistency is the key to winning titles and consistency cannot be maintained when punching above your weight. Wengers tactics and management are hard to question at large given that he is incredibly successful with a high win percentage and the accolades he has won from his players, current and past. In case you've forgotten, we just won back to back FA cups and were largely regarded as the second best side in the Premier League.  On the buying front, he has made mistakes by not buying, but sometimes it's because he is a stickler for quality and squad balance. He doesn't just buy a dude.  However, I don't think we are punching above our weight anymore and I am sure we will win the title in the next 3 years."
Gunners,3dvh40,omgender,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:49:55 2015 UTC,"Well said. I'm tired of seeing people always defending Wenger no matter what. Always finding excuses to put the blame off of him. There simply is no other club who has a manger with as much control over the club as much as he does. So why in the world should he not be blamed for our failures? I'm honestly tired of people continuously making excuses for him whether it's because we failed to fill the glaring holes in our squad, or because of his piss poor tactics in matches.  It's refreshing to see someone put my thoughts into words better than I ever could. Your comment ""if you are a world class manager, you should be able to punch above your weight or at least make it difficult for teams who are ""superior"" or spending more money."" really resonates with me."
Gunners,3dvh40,ohmahgurd,3,Mon Jul 20 01:06:20 2015 UTC,This subreddit is absolutely terrible with criticism of the manager but you have to consider the fact that the majority of users in here only started supported the club because of Arsene Wenger and the style of play he brings to the team. Criticising the man probably feels like you're attacking the validity of their support.
Gunners,3dvh40,SlovenlyRed,0,Mon Jul 20 01:24:30 2015 UTC,probably until we clearly can compete financially and spend 100 million+ ever year like the other clubs do
Gunners,3dvh40,ohmahgurd,-3,Mon Jul 20 00:21:10 2015 UTC,Money is not an issue anymore. He's said he will spend the money if a player he wants is available.
Gunners,3dvh40,omgender,7,Sun Jul 19 23:03:05 2015 UTC,"By saying ""money is not an issue anymore"" he means that we don't need to sell our best players to pay off debt anymore. But when it comes to transfers, our budget is still laughable compared to teams like Chelsea, City or Untd."
Gunners,3dvh40,ohmahgurd,-2,Sun Jul 19 23:19:20 2015 UTC,This club is acapable of buying quite a few 40M players with 100k+ wages. M
Gunners,3dvh40,JeroenWing,2,Sun Jul 19 23:26:24 2015 UTC,Oh really? Because last i checked we didn't have a billionaire willing to poor money into the club or a national government to fund us or a league that basically acts as our training camp for players.
Gunners,3dvh40,Medfly70,-4,Mon Jul 20 00:20:17 2015 UTC,Okay.
Gunners,3dvh40,ohmahgurd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:46:08 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, ohmahgurd is ITK with the Arsenal accounting department.  I look forward to your exclusive Twitter scoops."
Gunners,3dvh40,Medfly70,2,Mon Jul 20 01:07:57 2015 UTC,"It is an issue to a point. He still has to be smart with it. Not go and spent 59 mil and a 140k a week on a Sterling. Plus for us to get the big name players, we have to wait for other players to move so we can take advantage."
Gunners,3dvh40,ohmahgurd,0,Mon Jul 20 00:32:08 2015 UTC,"Okay, all I'm saying is that we're in a very good position as a club atm, if he is a world class manager as so many of you proclaim, he will win this team something major"
Gunners,3dvh40,essdotc,3,Mon Jul 20 00:45:42 2015 UTC,"What's major? Because he's already won the league three times (once unbeaten). He is a world class manager, he's got nothing to prove. Di Matteo won the CL. He's not fit to clean Wenger's shoes."
Gunners,3dvh40,ohmahgurd,0,Mon Jul 20 03:13:03 2015 UTC,"I clearly said what's major. How long has it been since we've won something major? he's hidden behind the excuse of stadium debt/no money to compensate for poor performances but he can't do that anymore. He has the money, he has the players, so go out and win something..if he REALLY is a world class manager as so many people like to shove done everyone's throat, fucking show it. Win the title that he hasn't won for more than a decade...Win the Premier League. Win the Champions League. That's what a major trophy is."
Gunners,3dvh40,Medfly70,2,Mon Jul 20 04:36:19 2015 UTC,"Even if we spend money that doesn't give us the absolute right to win the league. It's not like United, City and Chelsea will just roll over you know."
Gunners,3dvh40,AnElegantPenis,-1,Mon Jul 20 08:16:13 2015 UTC,Then Wenger's not world class
Gunners,3dvh40,ndenoon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:41:39 2015 UTC,Champions League is luck of the draw and you gotta home Messi is injured. I'd rather us win the league.
Gunners,3dvh40,AnElegantPenis,-8,Mon Jul 20 17:08:25 2015 UTC,"I use to be really snobbish about Wenger with people who were openly defiant against him. I'd call anyone crazy if they criticized him. Not anymore, I removed my rose tinted glasses right after those heavy defeats in the 13/14 season, and now I'm able to see things much more objectively. My opinion on Wenger is simply that he's an okay manager tactically with incredible lows, and not so many highs, and one of the best at recruiting, and nurturing players."
Gunners,3dvh40,ndenoon,4,Sun Jul 19 23:58:40 2015 UTC,Incredible lows?
Gunners,3dvh40,AnElegantPenis,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:08:31 2015 UTC,Yes when he shits the bed
Gunners,3dvh40,ndenoon,7,Mon Jul 20 00:31:06 2015 UTC,Yet hasn't finished below fourth in an absurdly long time. On that view he's been exceptional at avoiding genuine lows.
Gunners,3dvh40,Goongineer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:37:35 2015 UTC,"I never said he has them many times a season, merely that when he has them( around 5ish times a season), they're shocking."
Gunners,3dvh40,AnElegantPenis,2,Mon Jul 20 00:41:52 2015 UTC,"I see, if you're referring to specifically tactical lows, then okay."
Gunners,3dvh40,Goongineer,4,Mon Jul 20 01:07:12 2015 UTC,"I couldn't disagree more.  The ""incredible lows"" that you talk about are one or two games a season. The highs that you dismiss are consistency during low spending periods and now two trophies in two years when he has money to compete."
Gunners,3dvt49,blazeofgloreee,34,Sun Jul 19 23:13:42 2015 UTC,a potential target for Chelsea and Liverpool   They just couldn't resist could they?
Gunners,3dvt49,WengersCDM,48,Mon Jul 20 07:06:59 2015 UTC,"Theo in form and fully fit is extremely unpredictable, dangerous, and incredibly prolific."
Gunners,3dvt49,a_posh_trophy,24,Mon Jul 20 00:33:58 2015 UTC,One of our only players that will go down byline for cross in addition to taking defenders on the inside. This was why he had like 50% of the team assists few years ago.
Gunners,3dvt49,Mathieulombardi,3,Mon Jul 20 01:01:11 2015 UTC,"An intelligent and truly brutal goalscorer. His minutes per £ salary has been woeful. The money Arsene has lost by rehabilitating him in and out is going to weigh on this contract I have no doubt. Imagine giving him the ST position and turning down new blood, only for him to get injured again. Where will we be then? I have so much love for him but he has to understand his own value."
Gunners,3dvt49,JKultra,3,Mon Jul 20 21:40:18 2015 UTC,"Walcott is sleeping on his contract, despite all the good quotes on the press, he still hasn't signed.  Question for you guys : what are the odds of him sleeping over it (to gain time) and having as objective to play well, stay fit, seize his opportunities and... increasing his market value/desirability on the market for a probable switch if the club doesn't meet his demands during negotiations ?  What are the odds of this happening ?"
Gunners,3dvt49,Duke--Nukem,7,Mon Jul 20 10:43:14 2015 UTC,"Odds of that happening would be reasonably high I would say. While I can't see him going overseas, I can see Liverpool, City, United or Chelsea making offers for Theo. All of these clubs have a wage structure that will allow it as well. While I would argue United and Liverpool would probably be a step down for his career, as we saw with Milner, that sometimes is not very important. He may well run his contract down and leave for free."
Gunners,3dvt49,deejay_3,10,Mon Jul 20 11:53:18 2015 UTC,"If this happens, it'll be like stabbing Wenger in the back because he'd have given minutes allowing him to get his confidence and play level back at the expense of the development of other players.  I hope he'll sign before the season starts though."
Gunners,3dvt49,Duke--Nukem,9,Mon Jul 20 11:56:38 2015 UTC,"I hope he'll sign soon as well. I'm just a little worried about this situation. Last time for Theo to sign, the club had to meet his 100k a week demands and he only signed a short contract, hopefully this time around he's not asking for much more because he certainly hasn't justified it as he's been injured."
Gunners,3dvt49,deejay_3,-3,Mon Jul 20 12:03:56 2015 UTC,"Assuming either Arteta or Le coq is played,its either Ozil gets benched or he plays on the wing right?Cause Ramsey and Santi are definitely starting. Where does this leave Walcott?  Just a question, not saying things will play out like this."
Gunners,3dvt49,DylanMarshall,42,Mon Jul 20 00:42:57 2015 UTC,"Ozil's never gonna get benched for Theo. If anything, Theo will replace Giroud up top for a few matches, otherwise he's playing on the right wing with Alexis on the left, and any combination of Ozil, Rambo, Santi, Coq, and Wilshere in the last three midfield positions. Ox and Welbeck will rotate on the wings, and we could see Ox spend some time in midfield and Welbeck up front."
Gunners,3dvt49,beardofconfucius,23,Mon Jul 20 00:48:56 2015 UTC,"Man,it's so weird seeing Arsenal having all these options.Even forgot about wilshere for a sec there."
Gunners,3dvt49,DylanMarshall,16,Mon Jul 20 00:51:49 2015 UTC,This is what years of having to stack players to accommodate for chronic injuries does...once everyone is fit there are WAY too many players!
Gunners,3dvt49,Ross5512,22,Mon Jul 20 01:51:28 2015 UTC,It's called depth. It's ok. Don't be alarmed.  :)
Gunners,3dvt49,vantagegt,7,Mon Jul 20 03:37:34 2015 UTC,No. Özil is our best and most important player.
Gunners,3dvt49,yesitsanextender,-3,Mon Jul 20 07:16:26 2015 UTC,"If he's truly happy, hopefully he doesn't ask for 100k per week wages if he has another season playing as backup winger to Ramsey/Ox again"
Gunners,3dvt49,VanPerstrings,10,Mon Jul 20 02:06:43 2015 UTC,"100k was the last contract, this time he's asking for more."
Gunners,3dvt49,midas22,2,Mon Jul 20 06:18:04 2015 UTC,and rumour was that Arsenal wanted to pay less. thus stalemate.
Gunners,3dvt49,Searocksandtrees,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:24:49 2015 UTC,"Which makes it even more absurd... He hasn't improved at all since that last contract, really."
Gunners,3dvt49,VanPerstrings,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:31 2015 UTC,Why ask for less as long as the fans pay top dollar to watch the team qualify for CL every season?
Gunners,3dvt49,midas22,7,Mon Jul 20 21:07:38 2015 UTC,"He deserves 100k+ a week. He's worth 20+ goals a season and consistently scores against the top teams in England and in Europe. He's one of our biggest goal threats if he's playing. He's 26, we can possibly get 4 more top years from Theo and it's worth it."
Gunners,3dvt49,Guidosama,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:29:51 2015 UTC,In no season in the past ten years has Theo matched or beaten Sanchez or Giroud's last season strike rate.    £120k is a bit ridiculous as he hasn't proven that he is worth that much.
Gunners,3dvt49,FlyingSquirrelArmy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:01:52 2015 UTC,"How is he worth 20+ goals a season? He has only hit that once in his career and hasn't been close since.  I don't think he is good enough technically to play as a starter for Arsenal, but he is the perfect player to come off the bench and start in league cup matches. Sanchez, Giroud and even Ramsey are better goal scorers. It's been nearly 10 yrs for Theo at Arsenal and I don't think I've seen a more frustrating player with 1on1s vs. the keeper. His touch in the box is really frustrating for me. In that regard, I think Ox is way better around the net with his ball control."
Gunners,3e2pwb,erts,23,Tue Jul 21 14:34:09 2015 UTC,"Interesting tidbit, and thanks for sharing, but this doesn't have anything to do with Arsenal."
Gunners,3e2pwb,Ross5512,2,Tue Jul 21 14:36:29 2015 UTC,"Ya if the transfer actually happened it would be worth mentioning maybe but if we're including rumours on what other teams are going to sign, the subreddit will turn into mush i.e. the daily mail."
Gunners,3e2pwb,Sayek,8,Tue Jul 21 14:57:34 2015 UTC,"Almost as if this isn't a football sub. I know it doesn't have anything directly to do with us, but this is a massive bit of info about our direct rival, so if it materialised it would affect us massively. We should be able to have a discussion about things that are football related on this sub. It shouldn't be so Arsenal related that I'm resurfacing pics of Herbert Chapmans bollocks for the sake of content.  I actually enjoy talking about these things with my gooner mates in person, I guess people would rather keep it different on here. Im acting on the belief that this is more real than not, so sorry if it didn't seem worth mentioning. Apologies again for diluting the sub into a worthless piece of mush, carry on posting pictures of Giroud's hair, I know we all love that."

Gunners,3e2pwb,ZXXA,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:55:50 2015 UTC,"Who cares. It'll be Pedro or some shit. People here overestimate United here. You'd think they were still a massive European superpower the way you lot go on.   Wow they signed Darmian, an unproven right-back, Depay who won't be anything amazing in the PL until he gets a bit older possibly, Schweinsteiger who is more name than anything else. His body is pretty much past it and his form suffers because of it and Schneiderlin who while being a good signing is no more of a game changer than Cech would be for Arsenal, arguably less so."

He's been doing a lot of stuff lately (about more than just Arsenal) in the last 12 months or so after a long break.  Edit:  Basically, we've been more or less on a par with Liverpool in terms of wages, and way behind in terms of transfer expenditure. We've been way behind in transfer expenditure, and a bit ahead in wage spend as compared to the spuds. We're closing the gap to the top, but even now, we're closer to Liverpool than to Chelsea in terms of wages. I also think that by the end of this transfer window, if a huge signing is not made, our wage bill will be about the same, or even a bit less than what it was last year (+Cech-Podolski-Ospina/Sczeszny - Diaby + CoqExtension+WalcottExtension+BellerinExtension)."

Gunners,3e2sz4,sidgolan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:32:33 2015 UTC,"He'll probably say that was referring to the bundesliga player, while this is about benzema lol."

It literally costs nothing to remain neutral to this and to wait.  Let's not start saying how much of a piece of shit this guy is when this is his job. Yeah he's mouthing, but there'll be a giant serving of egg on people's faces if he's right.   If he's wrong, go to town on the cunt.  (braced for karma impact)"
Gunners,3e2sz4,ethelber,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:29 2015 UTC,"If hes right about what? He kept making references about an ongoing deal and said talks were going on and were on the verge of completion, and now he brings up bollocks of a bid being made, and hoping it will be accepted.   Any fan with some transfer knowledge would know that players are allowed to discuss terms and speak to another team only after permission is granted from their parent club or after a bid has been accepted for him.   So what on earth was all the drivel this guy Ozcan has been pushing on for weeks? Another poster on this thread summed it up perfectly by saying that Ozcan is just dragging this ""unknown player"", upcoming signing through this window knowing that with the trend of the past 2 summers we have signed a couple of world class players, and the probability of that eventually happening again in the next few weeks would then inevitably give him bragging rights by him saying he ""called it"", when in reality he is playing the odds, rolling the dice basically and hoping just like we are.   Come on man, even you cannot believe some guy on twitter has this incredible inside knowledge which he posts vaguely for months now and no credible news outlet has picked up on any concrete new deal involving Arsenal? You know how much money he would get for selling such information to a media outlet instead of giving away such drivel for free on twitter? Why doesnt he? Because he knows nothing."
Gunners,3e2sz4,sidgolan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:39:33 2015 UTC,"I think he's as full of shit as the next guy, but you really think no one talks to another club unless a bid has been accepted? It happens all the time all summer long."
Gunners,3e2sz4,Arsecarn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:53 2015 UTC,"It does happen all the time, but that is called tapping up, and doesnt really classify as ""ongoing negotiations"" and ""talks are progressing well"", and ""about to complete the signing of the summer"" now does it?"
Gunners,3e2sz4,sidgolan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:53 2015 UTC,"The thing is, he can keep going on like this and then just nail all of his speculation onto the name of the player that Arsenal eventually may sign. He's said barely anything of actual content, other than different shades of ""Maybe"" and favouriting other tweets. Just like the @JanAageFjortoft tweet ""No comment"", these people know fans will put what ever meaning into it they want. Or Kike Marin saying stuff like ""Maybe a signing? Long window!"". Fucking hell, i could have said that. I mean Rolls royce=Reus? Get off it.  These people are fortune tellers pretty much. If you want to believe it enough, it makes sense and adds up. They create an image of knowing more than you, then make you believe it."
Gunners,3e2sz4,bnfdsl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:45 2015 UTC,He has said a bid has been made. If a bid has not been made today then he's talking bollox.  Official bids are usually reported even if they don't succeed.

Gunners,3e2sz4,Flaminis_sleeves,5,Tue Jul 21 15:10:46 2015 UTC,"Not really. As with Ozil, Sanchez, and especially Chambers Wenger likes to keep quiet on most transfer deals. This is even more true when ManU are looking for a striker and would want to hijack a deal with him"

Gunners,3e2lc6,keloka4,8,Tue Jul 21 13:56:41 2015 UTC,We're not a selling team. Wenger won't sell to a rival. Why?
Gunners,3e2lc6,comehomecarl,5,Tue Jul 21 14:20:19 2015 UTC,"He was our leading goalscorer just a couple of years ago. If he stays fit then, yes. He's not on the same level as Alexis but he is still a strong goal scoring threat."
Gunners,3e2lc6,Moo__cow,9,Tue Jul 21 14:27:37 2015 UTC,"I think he knows Arsenal is best place for him. Going to Liverpool menas going down for his career.   But, put aside that argument, I think his career in our team is up to buying another striker ( or Giroud. But, Giroud is a most reliable fit guy in our team and that is most important thing for us though. )"
Gunners,3e2lc6,hangaram,4,Tue Jul 21 14:05:16 2015 UTC,"Slow news day, and Woolwich1886 needed a headline to get some hits. Only need to look back at the end of the season (for those with short memories) to see that Theo has a future here."
Gunners,3e2lc6,jMz23,0,Tue Jul 21 14:31:07 2015 UTC,if you're referring to his hat-trick against WBA remember that they were basically on holiday by that point and couldn't be bothered.
Gunners,3e2lc6,jMz23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:29 2015 UTC,"They beat Chelsea 3-0 a week earlier (excuses can be made that Chelsea already had the title won, but they don't give up losses cheaply regardless) and I can't imagine Tony Pulis ever sending a side out to face Arsenal in holiday mode. We were simply too good for them that day, and turned on the style in the first half - Theo played a big part in that.  Not only that, he scored the vital opening goal in the FA Cup Final and added new life into our attack, after some less than impressive attacking displays against Swansea, Man Utd and Sunderland."
Gunners,3e2lc6,islander1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Tony Pulis was pretty PO'd after that match. If there was any 'mailing it in' happening at all, it sure as hell wasn't from him. I wouldn't want to be in that locker after the match."
Gunners,3e2lc6,TheMuff1nMon,2,Tue Jul 21 19:30:14 2015 UTC,"Yes. Theo and Giroud have always linked well, so if Theo isn't backup striker, play him at RW. This would of course put Ox as backup, which is a shame as he did well last season 95% of the time he played. Some might argue that if Bellerin is RB then our right would be too exposed. My argument is that Bellerin is a defender first and foremost, while he does possess great attacking ability, if he can't do his job without us having to play a defensive player (such as Ramsey) in front of him, he isn't progressing. We need to see that progression this season. Now if Debuchy starts, no issue."
Gunners,3e2lc6,spladarpidus,2,Tue Jul 21 15:07:24 2015 UTC,We won't sell Theo to Liverpool.
Gunners,3e2lc6,TheDevilsAgent,0,Tue Jul 21 16:42:47 2015 UTC,Theo and Alexis should be our starting wingers when both are fit. Don't even see a debate here. It's Jack and Aaron that shouldn't start when everyone is fit.
Gunners,3e2lc6,AfricanRain,2,Tue Jul 21 16:05:19 2015 UTC,Theo gets into the team over Ramsey over my dead body
Gunners,3e2lc6,TheDevilsAgent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:55 2015 UTC,"I hope you're laying on the ground then since Ramsey isn't a great winger, he's central, but he's competing with Santi then."
Gunners,3e2lc6,AfricanRain,2,Tue Jul 21 17:52:26 2015 UTC,Don't care. Ramsey isn't being dropped for Theo.
Gunners,3e2lc6,TheDevilsAgent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:37 2015 UTC,I agree because he's being dropped for Santi.
Gunners,3e2lc6,islander1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:30 2015 UTC,"You lost me at Aaron.  Sorry mate, Aaron should always be in our lineup, unless his fitness is in the red. He's our best midfielder. Period. I'd sell Santi in a New York minute if I had to choose between the two of them.  It's nice having two world class playmakers in our midfield, but Santi seldom scores goals (while Aaron does) and Aaron does plenty well in the assist department as well. This is ignoring his defensive contributions and overall industry on the field that far surpasses Santi.  Santi's great, don't get me wrong, but he's not Welsh Jesus.  The minute we acquired Ozil, Santi became an alternative for the position (and others)."
Gunners,3e2lc6,TheDevilsAgent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:30 2015 UTC,"Wenger's played Santi over Ramsey at the end of last year and with good success. Now, this is Wenger so he may decide to play a double pivot with Ramsey and Santi and leave out a true DM (which I'd hate but whatever), but as of now it's looking like Aaron the winger vs Theo the winger. And in that case I'd choose Theo easily. Aaron the player vs Theo the player and I'd go Aaron."
Gunners,3e2lc6,NoMoreMountains,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:32:12 2015 UTC,"I think Wenger is moulding Walcott into Alexis. For the first two weeks will start in place of Alexis to easy the wear and tear on Alexis.  What he makes of those chances will decide his future. If he isn't careful, Akpom might over take him. He is more versatile and performing."
Gunners,3e2lc6,Person0fInterest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:20 2015 UTC,Yes Akpom is more performing after one hattrick against shitty asians
Gunners,3e2lc6,NoMoreMountains,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:40 2015 UTC,True. I just prefer his technique on the ball slightly over that of Walcott.
