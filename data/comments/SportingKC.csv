SportingKC,3e5flz,hasfarr,15,Wed Jul 22 02:30:40 2015 UTC,Fact: Benny plays 3x better when angry.  Its like he gets charged up.
SportingKC,3e5flz,3kindsofsalt,13,Wed Jul 22 02:43:18 2015 UTC,We looked terrible for the first 70 minutes of the game. Someone must have found the power switch and flipped it on right then.

SportingKC,3e5flz,response_unrelated,4,Wed Jul 22 02:36:09 2015 UTC,"It's not even like Houston was playing good though. They sat back, played their bunker-ball shit and got a goal off a set piece against the run of play while we held possession."

SportingKC,3e38y3,walking_bass,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:39 2015 UTC,With all the games coming up I'm curious what lineup we'll see. Benny got subbed off and looked pretty tired last game. That really only leaves us with Roger in the midfield in terms of play making ability if Benny doesn't start.
SportingKC,3e38y3,Juventus19,2,Tue Jul 21 20:33:53 2015 UTC,"Luckily tonight is much cooler than it was Saturday. I'm expecting Benny to start and hopefully go 65 minutes or so. I could be wrong, but that's what I'm rooting/hoping for."
SportingKC,3e38y3,walking_bass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:14:01 2015 UTC,And right you are. Basically a full strength lineup.

SportingKC,3dsqop,ellswells,10,Sun Jul 19 02:31:41 2015 UTC,We looked really good before the heat took over. Great game from Espinoza.
SportingKC,3dsqop,mtibby26,7,Sun Jul 19 02:42:04 2015 UTC,He's struggled to find his form this season. He finally looked like himself again tonight. He had a great match.
SportingKC,3dsqop,Younger_Gods,2,Sun Jul 19 06:20:31 2015 UTC,"I think the team had an eye to the game on Tuesday, and after half time really took their foot off the gas."
SportingKC,3dsqop,fargo107,11,Sun Jul 19 20:23:23 2015 UTC,"I was there last night, first time ever. I will never, ever, ever attend a Sporting game again without standing in the Cauldron. That was probably the most fun I've ever had."
SportingKC,3dsqop,heavylids,4,Sun Jul 19 12:44:35 2015 UTC,Cauldron is the only place to be.  Especially for a person like me who tends to swear a lot while watching.
SportingKC,3dsqop,mtibby26,2,Sun Jul 19 13:22:36 2015 UTC,"The Cauldron's incredible, but there isn't a bad seat in the house. No matter where, there's still a ton of energy in the place."
SportingKC,3dsqop,nonameshere,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:44:33 2015 UTC,Same. I had never been to an SKC game and was absolutely loving the energy. And I got to see Benny rack me up some fantasy points irl.  Benny and Dom scoring on my end was a dream come true. Nemo scoring would have been more than I could take and I would have collapsed from joy
SportingKC,3dsqop,serious_black,10,Tue Jul 21 19:49:55 2015 UTC,And we STILL have only three losses on the year!
SportingKC,3dsqop,walking_bass,6,Sun Jul 19 02:41:54 2015 UTC,I would not have guessed that at the beginning of the season. It's been amazing to see the defensive depth of our rookies and the attacking variety of our whole front line plus Benny. Almost doesn't feel real.
SportingKC,3dsqop,serious_black,6,Sun Jul 19 04:58:42 2015 UTC,"Ellis, Dia, Anibaba, and Saad to a lesser extent are playing like seasoned veterans. I think some of that is because of the emergence of Mustivar. He makes the job of the back line a lot less pressured, and they're for the most part doing a great job defusing those attacks that do come through. As an example, Piatti's goal yesterday is the first mistake I can pin on Ellis in what must be weeks. We're keeping those kind of game-changing eff-ups to a minimum, and that shows how automatic they've become."
SportingKC,3dsqop,ThisIsMyNewUserID,2,Sun Jul 19 13:38:12 2015 UTC,And having outside backs on both sides who don't leave a gaping hole on one side or the other because they're ball watching on the other half of the pitch (Igor).  But Mustivar definitely makes a huge difference.
SportingKC,3dsqop,nonameshere,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:43:11 2015 UTC,And having outside backs on both sides who don't leave a gaping hole on one side or the other because they're ball watching on the other half of the pitch    That's what I thought caused the goal too.
SportingKC,3dsqop,nonameshere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:48:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'd totally pin that on Ellis. I saw it from the Cauldron---Right before it happened I leaned over to my girlfriend and said ""uh oh"" told her to watch how out of position LB and RB positions were and that they could nullify a CB with one good pass, and then boom. Goal.  Point being, I think the RB/LB positions were so far up and Ellis tried to cover their ass the best he good."
SportingKC,3dsqop,alexoobers,7,Tue Jul 21 19:48:17 2015 UTC,Feilhaber goal  Dwyer goal
SportingKC,3dsqop,Canuhere,6,Sun Jul 19 02:50:45 2015 UTC,Feilhaber goal  Feilhaber assist*
SportingKC,3dsqop,ThisIsMyNewUserID,6,Sun Jul 19 07:25:59 2015 UTC,"That was still a hell of a finish by Dwyer.  If he takes a touch the keeper's there, if he tries to hit far post the angle is funky and its probably wide, if he goes near post on the ground the keeper is there, if he gets to far under the ball to get the lift he needed to go over the keeper it sails, if he hits it harder from that exact angle it sails.  He perfectly one-timed it just over the onrushing keepers reach.  Put it the only place it could go.  But yeah, Benny's vision is insane."
SportingKC,3dsqop,nonameshere,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:48:30 2015 UTC,"That through ball was ridiculous. Not only did he see Dom making that run, but it was so perfectly weighted that Dom didn't need to take a touch, it was already right where he needed it to shoot.  I'm pretty sure I cheered so hard I blacked out for a second when that happened"
SportingKC,3dsqop,serious_black,7,Tue Jul 21 19:52:00 2015 UTC,"Guys looked tired out there, but glad we got the win in the end. Now they gotta rest up for Tuesday."
SportingKC,3dsqop,SamSniped,8,Sun Jul 19 02:29:09 2015 UTC,Give the players IVs and give them a day away from the heat. They've earned the rest playing through this obnoxious heat. Time to beat the shit out of the Dynamo!
SportingKC,3dsqop,Younger_Gods,5,Sun Jul 19 02:33:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if not for the heat, I think we could have finished with a better score line than 2-1. Still happy for the win and well held by our team. 8 in a row, let's keep them coming! SKCTID!"
SportingKC,3dsqop,gold13,2,Sun Jul 19 02:30:55 2015 UTC,"Nemeth should've had one, and Peterson was a foot away from heading in his own. Should've been up 4-0, as Peter mentioned."
SportingKC,3dsqop,nonameshere,6,Sun Jul 19 20:24:27 2015 UTC,Dom is one feisty mother
SportingKC,3dsqop,walking_bass,2,Sun Jul 19 03:24:52 2015 UTC,Ref would not call a single foul committed on Dwyer >:(
SportingKC,3dsqop,ThisIsMyNewUserID,10,Tue Jul 21 19:52:35 2015 UTC,The thing I enjoyed most this game was watching Espinoza. For most of the season so far he really hasn't looked quite like the most expensive player on the team should. That recovery that led to the first goal was classic Roger. I'm hoping this is the turning point for him and that he continues to dominate the midfield.
SportingKC,3dsqop,mjconns,3,Sun Jul 19 05:01:43 2015 UTC,Nemeth looked like he was legitimately dying as he left the pitch.  It was punishingly hot out there.  I hope they recover quickly and take it to Houston Tuesday.
SportingKC,3dsqop,tilIdie96,2,Sun Jul 19 14:51:55 2015 UTC,Was it just the heat? He kept pinching the bridge of his nose... I wondered if he had a migraine or something.
SportingKC,3dsqop,tilIdie96,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:14:10 2015 UTC,When Nemeth was subbed out I looked at his arm and thought I saw medical tape that would be used for an IV. He may have been severely dehydrated.  All speculation on my part though.

SportingKC,3d1cd8,fighterspj,2,Mon Jul 13 00:09:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah heh. I was thinking about the amount of Games Played at this point in the season too. Even though, if SKC maintains their current PPG, they'll be in the lead (it would be like a Win and two Draws every three games), they're currently listed in 6th on the table because they've played 16 whereas most teams have played 18, 19, 20, or 21 games. SKC could be at the top of the table with only two wins though (6 points).  I think it was a wonderful strategy to schedule as few games as possible around June / July with the expectation that we'd have to send Besler, Zusi, Espinoza, Nemeth, and de Jong up to their national teams (thankfully Espinoza and Besler aren't currently called up, which I think will change for Besler after the Group Stage of the Gold Cup).   What I observed last year was a combination of factors, including call ups and injuries depleting the team, as well as a sense that the team peaked around early August and then started a steep decline towards the end of the season.   Kinda like a horse race, with SKC sitting at the middle of the table even though they have the highest PPG average, I think it prevents the players from getting too complacent, knock on wood."
SportingKC,3d1cd8,lifeinrednblack,2,Mon Jul 13 00:18:22 2015 UTC,"Especially with all of the injuries we've had to our defensive line, this is super impressive."

SportingKC,3cdi33,Ralston_Cove,3,Tue Jul 7 01:45:34 2015 UTC,The last U.S. Game the American Outlaws tailgates in the Community America Ballpark parking lot. I always tailgate in the speedway parking lot. That's where I would assume most people are going to tailgate. Not sure about the price to park there though.
SportingKC,3cdi33,smjogrady,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:19:59 2015 UTC,Free parking available in both places.
SportingKC,3cdi33,ICouldBeTheChosenOne,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:47:43 2015 UTC,That's the tbones parking lot right?  Do we know if that's where the AO tailgate will be this time? I'm a new member from Topeka and this is my first us game.
SportingKC,3cdi33,Dabogimp,2,Tue Jul 7 23:37:17 2015 UTC,"There's a huge shopping mall area right by the stadium. Tons of shit to do, lots of places to eat. I'm not sure where people tailgate though, I usually just park by a restaurant   and drink in the car with my friends (something you're really not allowed to do)."
SportingKC,3cdi33,TheyCallMeBallin,2,Tue Jul 7 01:50:07 2015 UTC,Yeah i've seen all those signs yelling about no game parking.  Is that pretty strictly enforced?  It seems like it would be hard to track...  maybe not.
SportingKC,3cdi33,hasfarr,5,Tue Jul 7 01:53:22 2015 UTC,"I've never seen it enforced, and I've been to multiple games.  Source: I always park at the Legends."
SportingKC,3cdi33,SeppGoodell,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:00:16 2015 UTC,"It's not, but personally I wouldn't risk it. Even if it's the slimmest of chances, that would completely suck to leave the game and find your car has been towed and you don't even know to where.  I remember Arthur Bryants (fantastic bbq place) would allow you to park for the game if you ate dinner there beforehand. I'm sure there are other places that do the same. Even if you don't want to eat, you could probably just go in and ask if you can give them a $20 to let you park. It's right by the stadium too."
SportingKC,3cdi33,uptonhere,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:00:32 2015 UTC,"i'm not worried about parking.  I have hotel reservations, so I assume there will be parking available in their parking lot. But who knows, maybe every place will be squatted by the time I get there.  I was just curious in general.    Additionally, I would never take away parking spots from Arthur Bryants customers.  Good food there.  Let in as many people as you can, I say."
SportingKC,3cdi33,phong3d,2,Tue Jul 7 04:15:27 2015 UTC,"Hardly anybody will be eating there, or attending the legends (the shopping mall) in general that's not there for the game.  I always laugh at the ""NO EVENT PARKING"" signs because without SKC, the legends would be an even bigger failure than it already is and a huge number of fans that go to SKC games frequently enjoy the restaurants, bars, shops, etc. beforehand.  I know hitting up Jazz an hour or two before heading to the stadium is something I do a ton, and I don't feel guilty at all taking a parking spot if I spend money there.  Arthur Bryant's will give you a parking pass for spending more than $40 on food, I eat there every so often (I love it) but it makes me shit my brains out so I try not to before games, unless everything else is packed."
SportingKC,3cdi33,uptonhere,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:55:16 2015 UTC,"In general, when we go to games, we eat lunch or dinner at Legends first and might do some shopping beforehand. I have no issues parking at Legends for the game in that case - I'm spending money there and I usually park in the D&B parking garage away from ""choice"" spots."
SportingKC,3cdi33,TheyCallMeBallin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:29:31 2015 UTC,"Same here, except Jazz, since I eat there a ton before matches.  And really, without SKC, the legends would be a graveyard on a Monday night, so fuck your NO EVENT PARKING signs."
SportingKC,3cdi33,nonameshere,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:57:27 2015 UTC,I mean I've never been caught the 5 times I've done it. Just don't get out of your car when you're drinking.
SportingKC,3cdi33,uptonhere,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:12:34 2015 UTC,"I don't have any advice, but I just got drunk and bought two cauldron tickets for the Match. HYPE."
SportingKC,3cdi33,nonameshere,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:37:19 2015 UTC,"Awesome I will be there too.  I guess the Outlaws are in the South stands but the cauldron will be wild I'm sure, my first USA game and I wouldn't want it anywhere else."
SportingKC,3cdi33,brettryan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:59:46 2015 UTC,Same.  I'm an American outlaw here in Lincoln but at this point beggars can't be choosers
SportingKC,3cdi33,nonameshere,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:09:32 2015 UTC,Where? How much?
SportingKC,3cdi33,brettryan,2,Tue Jul 7 21:19:15 2015 UTC,"Member's Stand and the total after everything for two tickets was 170.00.  A tad pricey, but I won't get many opportunities to see the MNT."
SportingKC,3cdi33,jonathannevins,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:20:48 2015 UTC,True that!!
SportingKC,3cdi33,skcku,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:25:38 2015 UTC,"Anyone have a good low-traffic escape route for after the game? I'll need to get to 70E to head back toward KCMO. I've been to a few Sporting games, but I always get stuck trying to leave."
SportingKC,3cdi33,Dabogimp,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:05:16 2015 UTC,Where do you park? Lot F/E or STM?
SportingKC,3caoqx,arooney88,2,Mon Jul 6 12:44:17 2015 UTC,"Doubt that they have a big watch party, if any, but the American Outlaws will have their regular watch parties at Johnny's at the P&L for US Gold Cup games, not sure for the one on the 13th since most will be at the game."
SportingKC,3caoqx,downthebyline,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:22:08 2015 UTC,Yea I couldn't snag outlaw tickets while they were on sale but I'll be in town when the game is happening and I'm looking for a good spot to go to.
