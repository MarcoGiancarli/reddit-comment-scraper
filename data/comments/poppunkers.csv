These dudes WERE pop punk back then and if you liked pop punk you pretty much liked NFG. Now there are so many different bands, it's hard to appreciate a band who's heyday was almost 14 years ago. Like most music, it's rarely just about the music. It's the memories and your moment in time when you are listening to them.  edit - whoever downvoted me, you're a fucking retard."

And when you downvote a comment that is clearly explained, has no ill-will and at the time had no 'fucking retard', then someone is being fucking retarded. I was replying to /u/ipkiss_stanleyipkiss's comment since it seems like most users here don't have the experience of being in highschool when NFG was just gaining a name for themselves.

And yes, I read your comment, and I don't disagree with it. But it simply isn't okay to call someone a retard because you got downvoted. It's the equivalent of throwing a toy at the wall because you were told you couldn't go swimming today.   Again, grow up, dude."

poppunkers,3e0bk2,JayButler315,18,Mon Jul 20 23:46:40 2015 UTC,Yesssss. Loving the positive vibes
poppunkers,3e0bk2,DeIiriumTrigger,9,Tue Jul 21 01:21:49 2015 UTC,Agreed.  It's a breath of fresh air to see some positive vibes going through their music since most recent pop punk i've listened to (from my end) has been a little more on the negative/pissed off side.
poppunkers,3e0bk2,mistafree,14,Tue Jul 21 04:06:03 2015 UTC,Love it. Haven't felt like this since listening to enema for the first time.  This record's going to be insane.

They've always embraced the fact that they sound like ""generic pop punk"" (and even put that on a pair of shorts), but they kept it real with their lyrics. With this song they're kinda adopting the whole ""you're not alone"" ""you can do it"" generic posi theme. It's not bad, it's just something many many bands do when they sell out. I just hope that's not the case here. Hopefully they do more songs like Can't Kick Up The Roots. But, that's just my opinion."

poppunkers,3dyj2l,RedShiftedAnthony,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:03:02 2015 UTC,Guitar tabs.
poppunkers,3dyj2l,Dlgredael,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:05:37 2015 UTC,"They're guitar tabs for the main riff   Dah nah [chikita] Dah nah [chikita] Dah nah [chikita] Duhnahnahnahnahnuh  Duh nuh [chikita] Duh nuh [chikita] Duh nuh [chikita] Duhnahnahnahnahnuh  Chikita's are the x's, which represent hitting muted strings on the guitar for that sweet chikita sound.

poppunkers,3dyj2l,deathcabforkatie_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:12:05 2015 UTC,"I pretty much always end up playing the A (or equivalent) string in those kinds of power chords. Sounds a bit fuller and it's just as easy to hold down two strings with your finger as just one, imo."
poppunkers,3dyj2l,bigfishbloom,2,Tue Jul 21 07:54:24 2015 UTC,What's the difference between tabs & chords?
poppunkers,3dyj2l,airball214,2,Mon Jul 20 22:03:49 2015 UTC,"Tabs are like a map that show you exactly what number fret to play on each string while a chord  can more or less be played in many ""locations"" on a fretboard, in different octaves. (High pitch/low pitch)"
poppunkers,3dyj2l,Dlgredael,0,Mon Jul 20 23:19:50 2015 UTC,"Basically with tabs you get the exact notes you have to play.  For the first strum above, you'd play with your finger on the 11 on the D string, 7 on the E string, and a mute in the middle.  Chords will give you something like lyrics with letters over them, and you'll know when you get to the part of the lyrics with a letter over them, you should be switching to that chord represented by that letter right in that area (if they did it well).  Tabs are very specific and give you all the info, while chords are great for reading and singing along.  If you're anything like me, you'll love tabs for the accuracy at first, but then soon realize (once you know your stuff a little better) that chords are much easier to pick up on sight.  However, some songs like this wouldn't be very good with chords, because those notes don't make a chord (you need three notes to make a chord) and it has a very specific guitar line that won't sound as good if you just use the closest chord to the guitar they're playing.  With stuff like this that doesn't use classic chords, you can usually get a good approximation that you could use for a singalong by the fire, but it won't be how the original recording goes."
poppunkers,3dyj2l,bigfishbloom,2,Tue Jul 21 01:15:52 2015 UTC,That was an awesome explanation. I started guitar in January and have only learned via chords. Was always curious. Thanks for taking the time!

I'm a big fan of the /r/posthardcore mix tapes that cover the previous 3 months of new releases, and are rarely the singles off the albums.  EDIT: Here's the most recent playlist if you're interested."
poppunkers,3dz96b,Pandos636,2,Mon Jul 20 23:41:09 2015 UTC,Is anyone making mixes like that for this subreddit? If not I'd be down to give it a try.
poppunkers,3dz96b,Pandos636,2,Tue Jul 21 01:07:52 2015 UTC,"No one is doing this for /r/poppunkers yet.  The only mixes I've found for this sub are like yours with EVERY major poppunk release from the last 20 years.  They are great for someone that just discovered the genre and wants a crash coarse in poppunk.  If you are a veteran of the scene you're looking for new bands that are experimenting with the genre in different ways.  I don't always want to discover music on this sub by clicking on youtube links, but I don't mind shuffling the spotify playlist while I'm doing something else.  Another advantage is you'll see a band on the mix and think ""oh, I've seen that band's name a lot, I should check out their songs"".  It has gotten me into a lot of smaller bands that I would have never heard of."

poppunkers,3dzxnn,repeat-,6,Mon Jul 20 21:59:15 2015 UTC,"I've loved all of Sum 41's releases for different reasons, but the one that stands out to me the most is 'Chuck.'   Chuck, to me, was the first album that Sum 41 took very seriously. A case could be made for 'Does This Look Infected' being the catalyst for this and I would agree with that. 'Chuck' marked the evolution of the band growing up lyrically and musically. Everyone was outstanding in that album. The band was pushing their boundaries and the response was generally very favorable. When Dave left this direction fell apart though. I always wondered what direction they would have gone in next had he stayed.   I'll find myself going back and listening to any of their albums from time to time though. They are easily one of my all time favorite bands."

They only played stuff from their newest album (played 1 song from Deja Entendu, Play Crack The Sky, and 0 from Your Favorite Weapon).  I know bands are going to play what's new, but to completely fail to play songs from the stuff that made you popular was kind of inexcusable in my book.  All Time Low was fabulous, despite the fact that I had lawn seats and couldn't hear a damn thing they were saying, and their singing was mostly covered up by all the teenage girls around me screaming the lyrics.  Still had fun though!"

poppunkers,3dv2vl,IlluminatiJesus,-5,Mon Jul 20 01:26:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe i'm an old cynical prick (For real), but i just can't get into these guys.. There is a lot of vocal tuning taking place in the production, and they just come off as a TSSF rip off to me.. What's the draw here??"
poppunkers,3dv2vl,mannermule,8,Mon Jul 20 01:52:22 2015 UTC,"Ben Barlow is a natural vocal talent. I really doubt there's a lot of vocal tuning. And this song really doesn't sound like TSSF at all. That complaint was kind of left behind after their last EP, for the majority."
poppunkers,3dv2vl,Dustla,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:19:40 2015 UTC,"Dude there is so much compression and chorus effects on his voice in this song. It's definitely doubled as well. A ton of the harmonies sound auto tuned. Not like T-Pain pitched, but there's a lot of audio trickery going on."
poppunkers,3dv2vl,slchawk,2,Tue Jul 21 03:24:16 2015 UTC,"I know there's effects like compression and chorus on the vocal track. Rarely any of vocals these days aren't doubled, either. My point was he said there was ""a lot of vocal tuning,"" as in re-pitching to make his voice more in key. Which, I'm sure there is. I just doubt there is an absurd amount to the point where it turns someone off to the song. The majority of the entire genre has vocal tuning to different extents."
poppunkers,3dv2vl,Dustla,-8,Tue Jul 21 04:01:04 2015 UTC,"You can doubt the vocal tuning all you want, but it doesn't change the fact that it is there. It's blatantly obvious. Also, just by watching a handful of live videos, it's clear that this dude can't sing for shit."
poppunkers,3dv2vl,mannermule,7,Mon Jul 20 02:48:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should see him sing live before judging him off some videos. He's incredible live. Even while jumping around and running around stage, his voice is dead on. Source: Once on Warped Tour, once in a small venue."

poppunkers,3dv2vl,pr0wnage,-3,Mon Jul 20 02:53:40 2015 UTC,This link wont play on my phone and i found it on YouTube but I dont believe it's the real song because of how low Ben's voice is. If that's the real song then I don't think I particularly care for the song and I'm disappointed.
poppunkers,3dv2vl,WhoThatGuy,3,Mon Jul 20 02:15:33 2015 UTC,The one on YouTube lowered the pitch of the song for copyright reasons. It sounds x100 better than the YouTube version.

Unfortunately, Knuckle Puck and Seaway played at the same time on my date so I didn't get to see Knuckle Puck (I love both but I like Seaway more). It was well worth it though. There was barely anyone at Seaway's set, it was me, a few of my best friends, then a few people up against the barrier. We all sang every word and it was really intimate and tight. The whole pit was just me and my friends. Best set of the day. I threw up after Beartooth and felt sick the whole day so I had to save myself for Seaway for like 7 hours. Which sucked because I was looking so forward to Citizen but all I could do was stand in the back."

The Kevin Says stage at Holmdel had barely any room so there was probably 250 people in the limited paved ground and another 100 up on a hill. The security were really chill and didn't break up moshing at all.  Seaway played near the end of the day but there was probably 70-100 people there singing along and about a dozen of people skanking (yes, skanking). Seaway seemed pretty happy with the turnout.  The only part of the day that sucked was TWY. It went from me being super pumped to super pissed and sick in a matter of minutes. As soon as the first song started, there were dozens of crowd surfers crashing down on top of people. My glasses broke and I couldn't breathe, so I bailed three songs in before going off and fixing my glasses and chugging four bottles of water."

poppunkers,3drjx8,PopRockRoll,3,Sun Jul 19 05:15:29 2015 UTC,My favourite TWY song. When they played it at my stop on their GK headliner tour I lost my mind cause they hadn't been playing it at the shows before. So awesome.
poppunkers,3drjx8,SuperSaiyanNoob,3,Sun Jul 19 01:21:31 2015 UTC,I don't need to pump my fist to look sweet.
poppunkers,3drjx8,ourannual,2,Sun Jul 19 02:10:12 2015 UTC,One of my favorites by TWY. Wish they played it more.
poppunkers,3drjx8,ConfidentCoward,2,Sun Jul 19 05:20:33 2015 UTC,"""And every word that I said got drowned out by dance remix of a pop song I don't care about,"" definitely a lyric that resonates with me and my deep hatred for crowded clubs that play shitty, bare-bones, pop song remixes."
poppunkers,3dtdkb,jezuzofsuburbia,18,Sun Jul 19 07:09:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what type of alone you mean but I'll assume the classic no friends/gf.   ""Too Little, Too Late"" by Transit, while upbeat, is depressing as fuck if you pay attention to the lyrics. While it's more folk rock than pop-punk, ""Divorce and the American South"" by Aaron West and the Roaring Twenties is good but pretty sad. Most of the album Maybe This Place Is the Same and We're Just Changing by Real Friends. I especially recommend ""Summer,"" ""I Don't Love You Anymore,"" and ""To: My Old Self"" but the whole album is great. Actually most songs by Real Friends are about being alone so have fun with that.  ""Pothole"" by Modern Baseball. Kinda depressing. Actually very depressing. Bring tissues. The rest of the album is pretty good, too, but not necessarily about being alone. ""The Medic"" by Foxing. Again not really pop-punk, moreso emo. Still good. Vocals are top notch. ""Won't Be Pathetic Forever"" by The Wonder Years is good and upbeat. By the same band, ""Melrose Diner"" is a good song but if you're in a particular mood the lyrics will hit you hard. I'm sure there are more TWY songs that are about being alone. ""Sasha"" by Turnover, especially the acoustic version is amazing. Makes me feel nostalgic for things that didn't happen. Going old school with some Tiger's Jaw: ""I Saw Water"" and ""Plane vs. Tank vs. Submarine"" are pretty good songs about breakups. Anything and everything by The Story So Far is about a breakup and fucking amazing. Listen to literally anything by that artist and you're good. ""Just Friends"" by Pentimento is a great song, although more about being in the friendzone than being truly alone. ""Prehistoric"" and ""But I Do"" by Now, Now are some of my favorites recently, but they're more indie/emo/etc. than pop-punk. The band has very relatable lyrics so I would definitely give them a listen. ""Lawnmower (Acoustic)"" by City Lights is good. I recommended the acoustic version because I feel like it fits better with the tone of the rest of my suggestions. You need some Brand New in here for no reason other than they're Brand New. Nothing specifically comes to mind about being alone so I'll recommend ""The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot"" because it's amazing and it'll be sad or something. ""Jesus Christ"" is probably better for this purpose actually. Any song off either of the albums those songs are on is pretty good so I'd give it a listen.  ""Separation"" by Balance and Composure is good. Lyrics are a bit less straightforwards than a bunch of other songs in this list but still would recommend.   That's all I can think of right now but yeah there you go. I'd also recommend asking around in /r/emo and /r/postpoppunk for more recommendations.  Also if a bot or something could make all my links into a playlist that'd be awesome.  Thanks for reading, hope you enjoy my recommendations."
poppunkers,3dtdkb,epicblob,2,Sun Jul 19 08:26:29 2015 UTC,This is an incredible list. Small addition: Two Good Things by Modern Baseball is more about loneliness than Pothole IMO

poppunkers,3dnww4,emptyshark,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:31:22 2015 UTC,It's at a place called The Webster. In all honesty it's a really crappy venue in a bad area of Hartford (I live in a surrounding town so it's super close by). I wouldn't expect a huge crowd based on past experience but shows are usually pretty fun though.
poppunkers,3dnww4,AustinFoShoYo,3,Sat Jul 18 20:52:17 2015 UTC,I saw them in Nashville and it was mesmerizing. I've listened to the whole album so many times in my car the whole night just melted together. It was beautiful.

poppunkers,3dp0ys,Addictedtotacobell,-3,Sat Jul 18 18:04:06 2015 UTC,No. Easycore is poppunk with breakdowns. Usually major key. ADTR is easycore. Not poppunk. Not metalcore.
poppunkers,3dp0ys,Silivin,2,Sun Jul 19 16:17:48 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9BHog80AlE  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EimXc69Q7h0  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-6pgfxbXA4  Does this sound like pop punk with breakdowns to you? As far as I know, pop punk generally doesn't scream during the verses. Sounds like metalcore to me. Especially the last one. If you group ADTR into one genre you're just wrong, there's no other way to put it in my eyes."
poppunkers,3dp0ys,Addictedtotacobell,-3,Sun Jul 19 16:18:56 2015 UTC,Please read up on what easycore is.

poppunkers,3dp0ys,camsmith328,0,Sun Jul 19 16:37:01 2015 UTC,That's like saying bring me the horizon doesn't belong on /r/metalcore because they're deathcore. It's pedantic and the genres are basically interchangeable.

poppunkers,3dk9zb,JoeyGinaldi,27,Thu Jul 16 23:16:50 2015 UTC,"Fuck, I love this song. Just pre-ordered the album; I'm so hyped.  This is such a good year for new pop punk."
poppunkers,3dk9zb,MacAnLuin,7,Thu Jul 16 23:43:48 2015 UTC,This makes up for last year by far
poppunkers,3dk9zb,hkdboarder42,2,Fri Jul 17 03:34:39 2015 UTC,"What happened last year? (Genuinely curious, I love this band but haven't really been following them much lately)"
poppunkers,3dk9zb,skatezero696,6,Fri Jul 17 11:58:44 2015 UTC,"Real Friends and Neck Deep were coming out with new albums and the hype around them was huge given the previous EPs. They didn't live up to the hype, to say the least. These two albums were the big releases of 2014, so the disappointment was real.  It was more of a great year for emo-pop punk (Modern Baseball, You Blew It!, The Hotelier, Tigers Jaw, etc) than traditional pop punk.  All State Champs released last year was an acoustic EP which was pretty good but we didn't expect them to release a new album last year."
poppunkers,3dk9zb,DarkSpawn890,3,Fri Jul 17 14:53:38 2015 UTC,Ah okay thought you were implying state champs did or released something bad that I hadn't heard of. Thanks!
poppunkers,3dk9zb,skatezero696,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:18:04 2015 UTC,"Nah, just not many releases, and the ones that did come out kinda blew. I had so much hope for the new Real Friends album but it completely sucked. Same with TSSF acoustic album, expected better."

poppunkers,3dk9zb,Flamoctapus,2,Sun Jul 19 03:42:08 2015 UTC,"Well, I expected the Real Friends album to have that pop punk feeling that it used to have, it kinda was a drag and just kinda made me feel like shit, there was no resolution or even upbeat feeling in that album. As for TSSF album, it was just way too short"
poppunkers,3dk9zb,hkdboarder42,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:47:36 2015 UTC,Yo finally someone else who thinks those two albums were severely disappointing. It's because of those that I'm so nervous about Knuckle Puck.
poppunkers,3dk9zb,Discovering_Oceans,2,Sat Jul 18 03:15:56 2015 UTC,I'm also worried but at the same time I have faith because I thought all three singles were great so far.
poppunkers,3dk9zb,DarkSpawn890,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:58:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, obviously those two bands are hyped to shit but there were way better pop punk records in 2014 including Fireworks, Major League, and Gnarwolves. Some other cool emo pop-punk bands with good albums were Sorority Noise, Moose Blood, The Menzingers, Elder Brother, and Joyce Manor. 2015 is a crazy year for music though."

poppunkers,3dk9zb,couverdure,2,Fri Jul 17 01:05:32 2015 UTC,First song I thought of was A Party Song (The Walk of Shame)

poppunkers,3dk9zb,millsieminor,7,Fri Jul 17 14:17:24 2015 UTC,This song would be a perfect mashup with Taylor Swift's - Blank Space
poppunkers,3dk9zb,Tomus,2,Fri Jul 17 01:59:40 2015 UTC,All I heard during the chorus was Blank Space

poppunkers,3dk9zb,therhymerr,6,Fri Jul 17 19:16:45 2015 UTC,"Right, but think of the rap fans who said the same when ""punk was too popular with the youngans right now"". In 10 years, I doubt they'll be listening to the same shit. Everything's a bubble."
poppunkers,3dk9zb,Dustla,5,Fri Jul 17 19:18:50 2015 UTC,Ever hear a song and know you'd like it after the first 10 seconds?  Because that's what this song was to me.  Fantastic.
poppunkers,3dk9zb,DHend10,16,Fri Jul 17 03:10:30 2015 UTC,Does the first part of this song remind anyone else of A Party Song (The Walk of Shame) by All Time Low?
poppunkers,3dk9zb,princetongirl1,9,Fri Jul 17 03:57:35 2015 UTC,State Champs are one of those bands that I like but I wish they had something worth saying.
poppunkers,3dk9zb,comicsandpoppunk,5,Fri Jul 17 05:39:29 2015 UTC,Exactly this. They have such a great sound but none of their lyrics hold any substance
poppunkers,3dk9zb,mtbow,3,Fri Jul 17 14:44:02 2015 UTC,This is so sick. Fuck yeah State Champs. The production is absolutely on point and the songwriting is better than ever. Bring on the album man this is awesome I can't wait!
poppunkers,3dk9zb,FUCK_YEAH_DUDE,3,Fri Jul 17 12:49:42 2015 UTC,State Champs are awesome.

poppunkers,3dk9zb,Billie_,6,Fri Jul 17 01:15:06 2015 UTC,"For all intents and purposes, this is their first album - at least to a majority of listeners. This will be the album you'll hear on the radio"
poppunkers,3dk9zb,Tomus,2,Fri Jul 17 01:58:04 2015 UTC,Hear on the radio? Unless it's some underground radio station you'd never hear this on a station with a decent listener count.
poppunkers,3dk9zb,SuperSaiyanNoob,2,Fri Jul 17 04:49:07 2015 UTC,"I wish I could hear this on the radio... Hell I'd even take stuff like the new Breaking Benjamin singles... Living in LA and all the rock stations just play the same indie/folk-pop stuff all the time. THAT said, this is a pretty great song, seems a bit like their last album but it's still super catchy and I hope it gets them up and on to bigger things."
poppunkers,3dk9zb,strikeamatch,7,Fri Jul 17 02:25:26 2015 UTC,Well they did go on tour with 5 seconds of summer so it's not totally impossible that they maybe get played a few times.
poppunkers,3dk9zb,himynameisroy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:22:44 2015 UTC,Nice intent but dookie and insomniac sounded basically the same before GD changed the sound
poppunkers,3dk9zb,therhymerr,2,Fri Jul 17 02:20:52 2015 UTC,"I respect Green Day for trying something different. The reason I don't like that approach is sometimes the genre sails too far away from what they originally were, and I lose interest. I'm glad this album will sound like The Finer Things because I know I'll love it."
poppunkers,3dk9zb,Trevorwirth,3,Fri Jul 17 02:26:23 2015 UTC,Green Day?! Every album was the same until American Idiot.

poppunkers,3dk9zb,DASboat,3,Fri Jul 17 02:07:55 2015 UTC,The only thing I like about this band is Ryan Scott Graham and his solo project is so much better than this band.

poppunkers,3dnbu8,__rosebud__,8,Fri Jul 17 17:46:53 2015 UTC,Not pop punk but for me it was American Football. Hated the twinkly guitars but now that album is one of my favorites.

poppunkers,3dnbu8,emptyshark,2,Fri Jul 17 22:51:34 2015 UTC,"I really like the album, but seem to miss this whole emotional roller coaster that everyone talks about when they listen to it. It's just another post/punk/hardcore album to me."
poppunkers,3dnbu8,emptyshark,3,Sat Jul 18 05:08:42 2015 UTC,"La Dispute's ""Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair"" was a hard one to grasp. But then one day it just clicked and it was the most amazing thing I had ever heard."
poppunkers,3dnbu8,TwingTwang,2,Sat Jul 18 05:11:54 2015 UTC,"Title Fight's 'Shed'. When looking around to see what was popular in the poppunk scene, TF were a band I saw frequently recommended. So, I went on youtube to listen to their most popular song at the time, 27. It was such a departure from the 'poppunk' I knew. The music video was interesting, but I couldn't get into the vocals at all. I replayed it a couple more times, and not much of it would stick. Shortly after, I found the chorus of the song stuck in my head repeatedly. When I finally got around to listening to Shed, I couldn't get into most of the songs, but kept giving it a shot. It steadily grew on me, and eventually I thought it was a pretty solid album."
poppunkers,3dnbu8,stayhome,2,Fri Jul 17 21:08:14 2015 UTC,"It was Floral Green for me. Shed still sounded enough like their previous stuff for me, but Floral Green was such a departure, where they just dropped pop punk completely - even Hyperview felt like a natural progression compared to it. But I absolutely love Floral Green now, and there's no way I could pick between it and Hyperview for my favorite of theirs."
poppunkers,3dnbu8,shards_of_hope,2,Fri Jul 17 21:16:17 2015 UTC,"Against Me! - Searching For a Former Clarity, it was such a departure from As The Eternal Cowboy and their other work. It's one of my favorite albums of all time though."
poppunkers,3dnbu8,johnthedudeguy,2,Fri Jul 17 22:08:01 2015 UTC,The other day I found myself thinking about how quickly I dismissed artists or even entire genres a few years ago. I think those kinds of rigid guidelines of what made something good came from a lack of experience of a full range of emotions and therefore no need to see them portrayed. It really is a shame. I try to become more open minded every day.
poppunkers,3dnbu8,DeadEndStreets,2,Sat Jul 18 00:43:05 2015 UTC,Aaron West And The Roaring Twenties was the one for me. Was so hard to get into but in the end it's a pretty solid album.
