ANormalDayInRussia,3dn5fx,Maniacykt,112,Fri Jul 17 18:35:21 2015 UTC,This Russia place sounds very progressive.
ANormalDayInRussia,3dn5fx,MyAssTakesMastercard,81,Fri Jul 17 18:51:42 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly, Russia sort of is and has been progressive for women since the 1920s. Not in exactly the same ways though.  Russia and the Soviet Union never had a feminist movement. Instead, the Bolsheviks simply declared women to be equal, and implemented a lot of policies to make this a reality. They were given the right to unilateral divorce, abortion, child support, and alimony in the 1920s. Women served in state positions as equals with men. The first female ambassador in the world was Alexandra Kollentai, who was appointed in the 1920s. There were early attempts at communal child rearing that essentially failed, but were intended to relieve women of the role of obligate child carer. Sexual liberation and independent women were also encouraged with state films such as Bed and Sofa.  Stalin began to reverse this trend slightly in the 1930s, and made abortion illegal again and encouraged the idea of a traditional nuclear family. Still, women continued to work more or less as equals among men in the factories, and essentially had double duty as a worker and a homemaker.   These combined ideas of Leninism and Stalinism more or less continued throughout the rest of Soviet history and modern Russian history. So, today, women are thought of in their traditional roles as homemakers and mothers, but they are also respected (again, more or less) as equals in the workplace. It's a very interesting development of women's rights that occurred almost entirely separately from Western feminism."
ANormalDayInRussia,3dn5fx,ijflwe42,4,Sat Jul 18 03:45:51 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the performance of female Soviet soldiers in WWII, like Shanina and Pavlenchenko. They found that on average, women performed better as snipers."

If they're officially equal, why doesn't child support and alimony work both ways? If the man is the one that keeps the kid, shouldn't the woman pay child support?   I guess this question also applies in our Western society."
ANormalDayInRussia,3dn5fx,USmellFunny,6,Sat Jul 18 10:29:50 2015 UTC,"Actually it did! Whichever parent kept the child had the right to child support, and if one spouse was making way less money than the other, they had the right to alimony. It just wasn't often that this applied to the man."

ANormalDayInRussia,3dln0s,Zapopa,3,Fri Jul 17 14:27:14 2015 UTC,Nah. My second wife was an interpreter for me when I was in the Soviet Union. That's how I met her and by god married her as soon as I could. While we were married she wore the ring on her left hand when she was in the US and switched to her right whenever we were in Russia. I always wanted to know why this was different between the Soviet Union republics and the rest of the world. Never did get a satisfactory answer other than that's just what it is.

ANormalDayInRussia,3dhw9f,Dr_Moo,11,Fri Jul 17 01:22:08 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of an old thread on a message board I frequent.  The question was: You find yourself face to face with a velociraptor, what one item from Home Depot would you want to defend yourself.    The proper answer was a safety cone, which could be placed upon the raptor's head."
ANormalDayInRussia,3dhw9f,DoctorPancake,4,Thu Jul 16 19:23:29 2015 UTC,A velociraptor was only about 2' tall and weighed about 30lbs.  A good crowbar/baseball bat would be more than enough to defend yourself from one.  Hell you could almost completely cover one with a safety cone.
ANormalDayInRussia,3dhw9f,bulldogdiver,18,Thu Jul 16 19:57:09 2015 UTC,It is called Enhanced interrogation and the polar bear confessed everything: he plotted a terror act - he and his brother.

A more famous university (if you're at all familiar with academia) is ""Lomonosov Moscow State University"", whose official translation is ""Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov"".

According to the story, Grigory Potemkin erected the fake portable settlement along the banks of the Dnieper River in order to fool Empress Catherine II during her journey to Crimea in 1787. The phrase is now used, typically in politics and economics, to describe any construction (literal or figurative) built solely to deceive others into thinking that some situation is better than it really is.

Claims that blond hair would disappear have been made since 1865.[1] According to the erroneous reports, the World Health Organization, or other experts, published a report claiming that people with blond hair ""will become extinct by 2202"".  The story about the report was a hoax—neither the WHO nor any reputable expert has issued such a report. Those who commented on this alleged report were asked by the WHO to retract.[2]   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  Don't let facts get in the way of your victim complex, though."

I can envision the fashion designers contemplating what best to computer design on the shirt, and they mutually decide why not just make the boy's fashion shirt advertise the topics in relation to boy's fashion.   But then (they said) let's Anglicise and proceed to misspell the Macedonian word, thereby producing the contraption SMINEM to the confusion of auto image readers and cause curiosity.

ANormalDayInRussia,3cf48j,RomanTPA,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:30:21 2015 UTC,"Kvass:       Kvass is a traditional Slavic fermented beverage commonly made from black or regular rye bread.  The colour of the bread used contributes to the colour of the resulting drink. It is classified as a non-alcoholic drink by Russian and Ukrainian standards, as the alcohol content from fermentation is typically less than 1.2%.  Generally, the alcohol content is low (0.5–1.0%).  It may be flavoured with fruits such as strawberries and raisins, or with herbs such as mint.   It is especially popular in Russia and Ukraine, but also well-known throughout Belarus, Estonia, Serbia, Poland, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as in other former Soviet states such as Georgia, Kazakhstan and Armenia, where many kvass vendors sell the drink in the streets.  Kvass is also popular in Harbin  and Xinjiang, China, where Russian culture has had an influence.

The cultural analysis is rather accurate if it is a 100% local Cobet piece. It's extremely Western for the time period in styling and music. It appears to be filmed in the 80's also as the video techniques.

ANormalDayInRussia,3bzt3j,onebadmofo,22,Fri Jul 3 14:07:46 2015 UTC,"This picture depicts a lifestyle on a spectrum... The spectrum ranges obviously poor to rich. In Russia, in the poor area at best you live in a big building with essential services, and the building will be in a land which you feel ownership of. The nice places of geography yours to enjoy. They are your weeds. You eat high quality bread, high quality milk, high quality cheese, high quality biscuits. You drink poor tasting mineral water and cheap but nice Lipton tea. The sink, sofa, table, washing machine, stove, oven, pantry, dishes machine, refrigerator, car etc. are all older models. A large turkey could just squeeze in the oven. A large full family soup could just fit on the stove. The ""bathroom"" is 2 separate rooms, this is a very nice detail. Their building is typically very well built. The hot water is centralized (e.g. Building's hot water, and even the city's, e.g. from outside the building, and produces a significant quantity, but sometimes incurs outages). The pipes of the hot water are sometimes on the walls and used to warm socks or towels. They will live in a city designed for walking, and public transportation might be excellent. They will typically walk. They enjoy community festivals, parties, events, outdoors, etc. primarily in their local area, but may travel occasionally on regional journies. When you walk into a shop they point at items they want, and the attendant retrieves and hands the item to them after payment. If they walk up to a drinks case it's locked, they signal the attendant, she presses a button, it unlocks and they can grab a drink. If it's a beer they can walk around the park-like city with it and enjoy the land and scenery. The roads are very wide, and if they want to they just walk accross it and cars drive around them.  The ""convenience store"" in Russia is smaller than the US convenience store, but sells the exact opposite of junk food (it sells natural food), may or may not have an attendant stationed in the booth, and may have a person sleeping inside there who wakes up to help you if it's a ""24-Hour"". The small shack or building traditionally has a number, but now has a brand name and artwork. If you need medical assistance you can go to a special store and speak directly to a doctor or nurse who will authorize a purchase of a product, or you can call them (""Med Sister"") and they will travel to visit you and sell you the product you need.  In the US the same poor person, adjust for relative purchase-power, that poor person will live in maybe 2 or 3 rooms with the same essentials. The building is extremely well insulated for the winter and actually becomes hotter inside than the outside air during the summer. The equipment is newer and not necessarily better. Nothing outside that space is theirs, especially not the country. In fact the 2 or 3 rooms aren't theirs, the equipment isn't theirs, and stepping into the building, or even outside into the country they are in a place that's not theirs. The creek is designated as an animal refuge with signs to not feed the animals and foamy chemicals flow through it. The field is some corporation's. The other field has wire and warnings to not step into it. The ""sidewalks"" are the designated ""public"" space, but you must remain moving on them by law, and a small section of grass adjacent to the animal zone is designated ""park"". You cannot legally walk accross the road, but if you do set foot into it you have the legal ""right-of-way"" in the order: Person (can't be there, but, authority when there), bike, car, big car. (Interestingly it's culturally the opposite in India but it still works fine).  The US poor person eats horrible junk food, occasionally has a healthy meal, and they will drink the world's freshest purest best water, and the water from their sink is 99.99% safe to drink without boiling. They will suffer from High Fructose Corn syrup, coffee, marijuana, cigarrettes, alcohol, junk food, air polution, etc. etc. and they will live in a city which is 80% not designed for walking. Their toilet is directly next to the bathtub/shower in a small ""bathroom"". Their hot water is produced by a large water-heater in their bathroom or adjacent area. Their kitchen is typical size but with bigger appliances. Almost 2 large turkeys can fit in their oven. Almost 2 large full family soups can fit on their stove, and they don't use it. They use a microwave. They will drive everywhere. There is little for recreation in the local area other than restaurants and bars - There is especially no local free festivals or free markets because of the Totalitarianism-of-Law phenomenon (new terminology), but while you cannot have your own festival or market in a field, the state runs a produce market on the weekend, and hosts stupid events which extremely few people attend throughout the year, but which everybody pays for - but driving up to 2 hours in any direction leads to some big attraction, beach, river, resort, casino, waterpark, children's park, etc. When they walk into a shop everything is laid out on tables and they pick up, ""try things on"", and then tell the store attendant what they'll buy. If they walk up to a drinks case, they pull on it, it's not locked, it opens, they grab a drink: water, beer, wine, chemicals, mystery proteins, etc. If it's beer/wine/alcohol they must show ID. It can only be transported in a bag. It cannot be opened until arriving home unless 100% of it is eaten/drank or consumed in state designated and authorized areas. The person cannot take any opened alcohol from the areas. They also cannot, whether legal or not, smoke Marijuana anywhere. Not in their building (building rules), not in their room (building rules), not in the parking lot (building rules), not on the sidewalk (city rules), not in the park (city rules), and the city has No-Smoking laws which enforces building rules. Only in some mystery location which is private, and then that's 100% permission to be fired from any job, just by having any detection of it in the blood, and employers in the US can and frequently do demand blood checks as condition of employment. While the US has every country's drug problem, the relative safety of Marijuana to caustic horrible alternatives is hoped, by some, to alleviate the problems, but is feared by others to act as a ""gateway"" to other drugs and both are right in respective ways.  If you require medical assistance you must pay $60-$200 to visit a doctor (the US mandates $300 a month from your account which might cover that fee), they will then send you to either a pharmacy to purchase the products they authorize, or they will send you to a $300 exam, or a $500-1000 specialist, and THEN you will pay for that treatment. You will then receive a series of bills requiring you to pay after-the-fact amounts you have no idea of ahead of time at all, which you are required by law to pay, in addition to the $300 Government Mandate, and many other Government mandates, which culminate in the ""Everyone works for the US Government"" phenomenon. If you add up all the amounts and distractions will make you go HOLY FUCK.  On the top-end spectrum the rich obviously transcend the conditions, but INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF LIFE QUALITY: There is no life for poor people in the US. They are 100% exploited and subjogated to a lifetime of servitude and suffering."

He has a house that he built himself. The house has poor insulation, but is unique and distinct, no two houses in the village have the same layout. He owns the house and can do whatever the fuck he wants with it. There are no building codes, no fire codes. There are no building inspectors and nobody cares how you do your electrical wiring. He does not need a permit to build anything on his property, he can build whatever the fuck he wants. He does not have a reliable hot water every day. He might bath once a week. He owns a sizable plot of land next to his house where he grows potatoes, beets, cabbages, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, radishes, carrots. He has an orchard where he has apples, pears, plums, apricots, grapes, cherries. He has a cow, couple of pigs, chickens, geese, ducks, turkeys. He does not need to buy food to get by, although his food might not be the most nutritious, especially during the winter. He has a dog that barks every time an unfamiliar person passes by. He is not forced to wake up early every morning to go to work. He can choose to work on his farm/garden today or not. He has no cable/phone/medical bills to worry about. In fact, he gets no mail at all. On summer evenings he might get visited by a neighbor to sit outside on a bench to talk about their daily lives. They laugh and joke around. They discuss their livestock or how good the potato harvest will be this year.   A middle-class man in America has a job. He can't survive without a job. The job pays relatively well. Every morning he needs to wake up and go to work. Every day he is tired when he comes home to his standard looking house in the neighborhood with 100 other houses looking exactly like his. He dreadfully opens his mailbox and sighs with relief: no bills today, only a junk letter from his cable company offering a bundle deal on TV+Internet+Phone. Tomorrow he will get a $1300 bill from a different city in a different state for some medical services he does not recall receiving. Must be from that visit to emergency room 10 months ago for which he already paid twice, had a stressful phone conversation with the hospital and his insurance company. He is too tired to cook anything so he just heats up some pre-packaged meal for dinner. He has a big TV, nice new kitchen, 2 bathrooms with hot water. He showers every day. The weekends are the best days in his his life because he doesn't have to go to work. He remembers he needs to go to town hall this weekend to request a permit to attach a deck to the back of his house. He got a pretty good mortgage on his house, only 3.7% interest, for 30 years. He has a little belly and ""love handles"" from a sedentary lifestyle and driving everywhere. Walking is not common in his city. Most of the time, the streets don't even have sidewalks. There are almost no pedestrians in his city. To get together with his friends, he has to call ahead and make sure his friends are available at that time. If he drives with somebody else in a car, it's called ""carpooling"". He can afford to drive a nice car and buy cool gadgets. He gets 2 weeks paid vacation in a year. He goes to visit some popular tourist attraction on his vacation. There are many people there. Everyone is trying to take pictures or film whatever attraction he's at. He thinks he had a good time, although he wouldn't mind if it wasn't so crowded. Soon, the 2 weeks will be over and he has to get back to his daily routine. Wake up. Shower. Work. Back home. Watch TV. Sleep. Wake up. Shower... His life is good. He lives in America, the best country in the world."

He even called it the ""National Anthem"" of his TV show ""Countryshow"". In January 2008, the song became popular in Poland, winning several radio hitlists. [citation needed] It is also popular in Hungary, Austria and Russia, sporting a cult following on blogs, and several versions of various translations. The song is a surreal tale of a mysterious man-eating monster living in the swamps (Jožin z bažin, Joey from the swamps). In the song, the monster is eventually defeated with the use of a cropduster. A Polish cabaret called Kabaret pod Wyrwigroszem created a parody of ""Jožin z bažin"", entitled ""Donald marzy"" ('Donald dreams'), about the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk. The Russian band Мурзилки International, made a Russian parody under the title ""Путин едет в Пикалёво"" (""Putin goes to Pikalyovo""), about Russia's former prime minister and current president, Vladimir Putin. There is a Serbian version of the song: ""Medo Brundo"" - Brundo the Bear. There are also several parodies of the song in Lithuanian, which are mainly about the country's most nefarious politicians and about the unpopular prime minister Andrius Kubilius. The Ivan Mládek Banjo Band created a Polish version of ""Jožin z bažin"". The nearest equivalent musical style in English is that of the Wurzels.

(EDIT: Actually buildings in the photo look small and those look like air circulation units. These appear to be Dacha blocks, secondary homes).  Peoples' houses are in there. Cafés are in there.

He is finest and most distinguish train repairmen in all of nation.  Let me to tell you story about my uncle Viktor. First you must know he is has no hair. (He is bald)! This important to the story, you will see why.  One morning in town of Bataisk my uncle go to work as train repair man. Is normal morning so far, he already do usual things like check train for oil leak, beat any homeless people who sleep in station, all is as usual. Now my uncle is very responsible man. He make all checks on train, and only once he satisfied does he reach for small half litre of vodka to warm him before he start journey.   Train is start and it go off towards Kamenskaya station as on schedule. Now on board is also great comrade and friend of uncle Viktor called Vasili. Vasili is, how can I say, rascal. He is always making joke on my uncle Viktor like putting train horn into small enclosed toilet. Ha ha, my uncle lose hearing because of him, (he is at first being angry for this, but he laugh many years later - he say is good now he cannot hear his fat wife ha ha).  Anyway train is go and on time for Kamenskaya, very good schedule, maybe running slightly late (2-3 hours), but is ok.  But Vasili now go to play joke on my uncle Viktor. What Vasili did is he place bucket of coal above train door, and lie quiet in wait (like wolf) for my uncle Viktor to come inside. Once my uncle Viktor come in door, Vasili knocks bucket of coal over and my uncle is turned black like great wild bear! Ha ha, Vasili laugh.  But then Vasili quickly stop laugh. Vasili did not realise that coal was still hot, from train furnace! He hear my uncle scream ""volosataya pizda!"" and run around train in pain.   So Vasili follow his training for emergency situation and fetch largest bottle of rakia he could find, and give to uncle Viktor for disinfect purposes (and is pain killer).   And this is story of how my uncle Viktor lose hair. Ha. ha  editing, I forget to say also my uncle and vasili got in some small trouble, when my uncle is running with hair on fire, Vasili is laughing on him and he forget to drive train... he cause some small problems when he have accident with other train, i think you can read some about it also on the wikipedia, is not big problem but it mean he have to wait another 2 week for promotion to train captain so he is small bit annoyed. He also tell train investigator that is not his fault, only engineers fault, (also it help that he give to investigator some fine Hrenovuha vodka, ) ha ha"

ANormalDayInRussia,3bik4k,Pkwlsn,4,Tue Jun 30 03:53:27 2015 UTC,"Our railways are alright, we have more and more modern stock and an hsr line between Moscow and Kazan (400kmh) is currently undergoing planning.

ANormalDayInRussia,3bibwe,EasternEuropeSlave,11,Mon Jun 29 13:55:50 2015 UTC,"one of the episodes about guys ""hunting"" corrupt police officers who compensate their lousy wages by asking bribes. Here is one of the successful hunts when they catch police officers offering to give them a bribe. So what I'm thinking is that those cops stormed out of the place in hopes that those guys would chase them, so they could have a reason to write a protocol (what they did, then those guys left their department) to cover their act of asking for a bribe. In this case,both police officers and their commander were fired from police. Few other policemen relieved from duties. Plus the whole department is investigated by the police internal security."

The drill sergeant went into some supply closet and came out with the ugliest fucking Bill Nye the Science Guy looking goggles and made him wear that shit for weeks until he got enough money to buy another pair of the ones we were issued.

The drill sergeants called 911 and an ambulance came out to get him. He was being sent to a hospital off post and the drill sergeants told another person to go with him as a battle buddy to call and give an update when he knew something.   Later the next day or so they both returned to our company area. The other guy that accompanied him to the hospital came back to the barracks and told us that the doctors could not find a thing wrong with him but they were putting him on a profile as a precaution. So he got out of pretty much everything else we all had to do.  The drill sergeants weren't good at hiding secrets so word spread fast that he had faked it to get out of the Army and they all gave him shit for it. That's kind of when we all knew something was up. He had 'nagged' the drill sergeants everyday about getting him out of this shit and how can I get out and so on. Soon after, they started, apparently, processing him out. We knew he went back to reception battalion and we never saw him again."

ANormalDayInRussia,3bawky,chief_savage,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:42:47 2015 UTC,"Frankly, this seems unlikely to work. In general, bacteria are way tougher human cells (especially if they're hostile bacteria, who are under the constant evolutionary pressure of the immune system), and the level of radiation sufficient to kill them is more than enough to give severe burns to humans. When operating a disinfection light in a room, you're supposed to leave it very quickly after turning it on, since it's much brighter than the safe level for humans."

ANormalDayInRussia,3ba6id,tsahyt,7,Sat Jun 27 13:19:57 2015 UTC,"The first ever recorded death by coconut was sir isaac newton, who was killed when one fell from his coconut tree as he was pondering gravity below. He would later use this knowledge to come up with the basis for newtonian physics, a theory most coconuts today credit for allowing them to continue their jihad against humanity. Other people die when attempting to eat whole cocunuts without chewing first, a practice that is not recommended. But by far the most deaths due to coconut have been caused by collision with motor vehicles. The cocounuts often fly through the windshield and kill passengers as they cross roads as part of their migratory patterns."
ANormalDayInRussia,3ba6id,BrainSlurper,8,Sat Jun 27 13:43:41 2015 UTC,"I get that people are concerned about killings and whatnot although th bigger issue is psychology and the social stigma around asking for help.

I mean, I'm gonna go back and watch the rest of the video but the link is supposed to start you at the part about the Russian military theme park.

ANormalDayInRussia,3b2d7c,Xenophore,7,Thu Jun 25 20:11:10 2015 UTC,"That is actually not an uncommon practice. Mobile cranes are built so their outriggers support the weight, and their lifting capacity/outreach charts are calculated on this.  Using wood dunnage to level a crane is perfectly safe as long as the timbers are sound and well secured.  Most crane crews keep a lot of timbers around for leveling and landing loads. Some are specially built and called ""mats"" and held together with long pieces of all-thread.  If you look at the wood, I would guess it is 4x6 and 6x8 hardwood or doug fir. Could be wrong, but that is a pretty standard type for this kind of application.  The only thing I would really question here is the terminal gear on the crane. With I-Beam like that, I would probably throw some softening material under the strap, or use chain to pick it.  No one realizes the pressure when lifting gear goes around corners.   BTW, I am a journeyman rigger, and I have been around lifting, construction and marine cargo since 2001."

However the bloodthirsty western warmongering propagandists see the news story and it vibrates a special excitement in them. Their mouths start salivating, and they feel titillation in their chests and their hairs stand on end. To all of reality, what is just a simple and understandable rule, to some becomes a plucked, crazy, yet easily believable alteration of reality - It's that alteration of reality's believability that the western war mongers require from you - and somehow that simple rule becomes portrayed as an entire society's daft submissive protest to follow a law.  For the sake of comedy the reality is pushed aside, and over time the sensationalists actually believe the shit you're spewing and it's your own people who become fake, and over time it's the fake people who are the dumb ones."

You make a new wall for your bathroom and you ""make it fit"" so you can fit your bathtub. You have a small bathroom, but you decide you want a bath tub and you cut a hole in the wall.    Silent option nr. 3. Don't put a bath tub in a room that is too small for a bath tub or remove the bath tub if you are going to make the bathroom too small for a bathtub ?   Not getting into politics with you since I'm in neither in the US or Russia. I can make you a stake for the vampires though."

Why put the bath there in the first place ? (or if the wall was relocated, which is unlikely but possible, why not remove it and replace it with a shower?)   Also, are you a construction worker?   No, I'm an engineer. But I worked in construction when I was a teenager and I would not do this then or now, even though I'm not affluent.   If you don't have the space or finance to have a bath tub, you can easily make due with just a shower.   Again, not getting into US politics with you."

The existence of a rare folk art piece, or a rare museam-grade engineering piece, does not make that truly ""rare"" as those seemingly rare things are everywhere.  Anyone who's been to Russia knows it's replete with social artwork.  Here's an example: I have personally seen 3 or 4 major different types of trains in Russia, and I have seen ornate subways, and I have seen quality engineering, and I have seen thoughtful design such as: A gap you don't have to constantly mind (UK), or, travel not needing to be like a mobile Nazi prison camp (US).  Trains? What trains do the people have? They are WAAAAAAAAAAAY better in Russia than in the US. I've been to both sides of the US and to rich and poor areas. We are talking about COMMON PEOPLE.

He moved industry and agriculture to Siberia east of the Urals, which was crucial for success during WWII.  Was it possible to win WWII without Stalin's specific policies? Sure. But his policies, as flawed as they were, did lead to victory in WWII. It's impossible to say exactly how it would have turned out under a different leader."

While he was somewhat responsible for the deaths of countless Armenians and Ukrainians, so too is he somewhat responsible for the saving of many Russian lives, as well as the lives of countless others of varying nationality. Under his tenure, life expectancy for his people doubled despite the loss of 27 million Russian lives at the hands of capitalist fascist Nazis. Likewise, such Russian progress halted within ten years of his death, dispelling the notion that Stalin himself merely was the overseer for inevitable progress. The quality of life of Russian citizens was highest under his reign. That doesn't even mention all of his active campaigning against imperial capitalist aggression, politically and militarily.  He killed millions, but saved tens or hundreds of millions more. He is responsible for both, and should be measured accordingly. He is simultaneously one of histories greatest monsters and humanitarians.  TL;DR: He is not worse than Hitler. That's propaganda. The USSR did a lot of good in the world and helped establish many successful communist democratically elected governments, including Afghanistan and Albania, which we then bombed the everloving fuck out of and toppled. Plus, you know, they were probably the biggest historical contributor's to winning the second world war."

ANormalDayInRussia,3adfsb,TylerDurdenisreal,-9,Fri Jun 19 23:25:00 2015 UTC,"Or, maybe I actually know about aircraft.   Being an expert has nothing to do with what the human body can and can not handle. I'm pretty god damn sure most military pilots could be considered experts and what they do, probably more so than her.  And for the record, forward movement has nothing to do with G forces from an aileron roll, so again, G-forces are bad and those would be really mother fucking hard G-forces."
ANormalDayInRussia,3adfsb,TylerDurdenisreal,3,Fri Jun 19 23:34:00 2015 UTC,"Aileron roll is not a very high-G maneuver dude, think through the physics. She's mostly just rotating around center mass, and not especially fast. So there is a bit of blood rushing to her head but nothing insane.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileron_roll   An aircraft performing an aileron roll will actually fly along a slightly helical path, and a very light, positive g force will be maintained.   A barrel roll has a much higher G-load."

Stop being an idiot."
ANormalDayInRussia,3adfsb,TylerDurdenisreal,10,Sat Jun 20 20:19:52 2015 UTC,"The footage is sped up. Stop being an idiot.   Maybe you should stop beeing an asshole and take a look at the original footage here   I am sure it is built to entirely higher specifications that any acrobatic plane.   You should (probably) also know that these type of aircraft are built for an entirely different task.  P.S. Even Blue Angels are ""stripped"" bare to be able to perform as they do."

ANormalDayInRussia,3a1tv5,MrNinjin,5,Tue Jun 16 17:49:41 2015 UTC,"yeah, hence the name:   In many languages, the raccoon is named for its characteristic dousing behavior in conjunction with that language's term for bear, for example Waschbär in German, orsetto lavatore in Italian, mosómedve in Hungarian and araiguma (アライグマ) in Japanese. In French and Portuguese (in Portugal), the washing behavior is combined with these languages' term for rat, yielding, respectively, raton laveur and ratão-lavadeiro. The raccoon's scientific name, Procyon lotor, is neo-Latin, meaning ""before-dog washer"", with lotor Latin for ""washer"" and Procyon Latinized Greek from προ-, ""before"" and κύων, ""dog"".   It applies to Russian too."

ANormalDayInRussia,39tgvh,every1wins,4,Mon Jun 15 04:55:23 2015 UTC,"In the US 80's there was a TV show about 2 Balkan brothers. One brother lived in the states already for a while and he brought his brother, Balki, over who was fresh from the Balkans. Balki was the best TV character at the time. The actor who played him was a Balkan comic or someone (Apparently he is Italian Russian but his father is from France and he goes by a French name ""Pinchot"").  Everyone is mixed intelligence levels, and everyone seems to have positive and negative aspects. It's possible the negative aspects are only from nature."

ANormalDayInRussia,39tgvh,autowikibot,2,Mon Jun 15 03:14:52 2015 UTC,"Perfect Strangers (TV series):       Perfect Strangers is an American sitcom that ran for eight seasons from March 25, 1986, to August 6, 1993, on the ABC television network. Created by Dale McRaven, the series chronicles the rocky coexistence of midwestern American Larry Appleton (Mark Linn-Baker) and his distant cousin from eastern Mediterranean Europe, Balki Bartokomous (Bronson Pinchot).  Originally airing on Tuesdays for the short six-episode first season in the spring of 1986, it moved to Wednesdays in prime time in the fall of 1986. It remained on Wednesdays until March 1988, when it was moved to Fridays. The show found its niche there as the anchor for ABC's original TGIF Friday-night lineup, though it aired on Saturdays for a short time in 1992.

ANormalDayInRussia,39puun,fdagpigj,27,Sat Jun 13 18:22:08 2015 UTC,The problem is as soon as you go above parallel to the ground the chain goes slack and you lose momentum.
ANormalDayInRussia,39puun,vspazv,18,Sat Jun 13 18:28:44 2015 UTC,"That's because you're not pushing hard enough.  In order for you to go ""all the way"", you need to cancel out gravity with centripetal acceleration. This is done easily with solid bars, as they won't be slack.  For centripetal acceleration, a = v2 / r For the best results, (minimal jarring), I'd say you want to be experiencing ~10ms-2 (1 s.f.), like gravity. This means that you'd need to actually have ~20ms-2 centripetal acceleration. Assuming that the chains are what, 1.5m(?)  20 = v2 / 1.5 30 = v2 v = 300.5 = ~5.5ms-1  Which doesn't seem like much (to some people), but consider that the value for the solid bar would be  10 = v2 / 1.5 15 = v2 ~3.8ms-1"
ANormalDayInRussia,39puun,ProjectFrostbite,24,Sat Jun 13 20:26:39 2015 UTC,"They tried it on Mythbusters, and had to resort to a jetpack to get to the appropriate angular velocity. The problem with doing it by hand is you can only build up speed little by little, and it's impossible to gain enough speed in a single swing before the chains go slack."

Sadly not many kids do it these days because the solid metal bars are being replaced by chains.  Another fun thing to do is when it has a break to stop the spin, but you can end up with your head down. We used to do that a lot too, just spin backwards and get stuck upside down."
ANormalDayInRussia,39puun,smekiar2,15,Sat Jun 13 21:14:14 2015 UTC,"Where i grew up we called it ""чукче"" (hammer). Then again our swings didn't go all the way around, there was another bar on top.

Междудругото знам, че попринцип се прави изправен, но ние го научихме седнали ""чукчето"", като си държиш краката под седалката. За изправеното си спомням че трябваше да буташ силно с ръце към седалката (нагоре) за да се получи."

Относно правото не съм обръщал внимание другите как точно го правят, но аз просто си променях центъра на тежест (накланях се напред, като исках люлката да отиде назад и обратно).  Помня че беше много актуално, докато едно момче не си пукна главата и тогава всички спряхме.  Имаше и едно друго нещо което се наричаше ""Гондола"". Стъпваш отзад на седалката и почваш да люляш някого. Обикновено се правеше на малките, или по-страхливите деца. Ето още Пикасо Paint произведения."

ANormalDayInRussia,39puun,BakeRolles,2,Sun Jun 14 00:05:31 2015 UTC,"Знам я гондолата.   В седнало положение не можеше да се задържиш дълго. Попринцип го правехме по следния начин: представи си, че седиш нормално и искаш ""да я блокираш"" (да спреш надолу с главата). Трика беше да си хванеш ръцете над главата зад дръжките и да си държиш краката плътно свити и прилепнали към долната част на седалката. Като застанеш в обърнато положение, тяло ти да се спусне надоло и да се задържиш с крака. Мърдане напред няма заради ръцете, а назад заради облегалката. Не ми се занимава да рисувам в Pain, пък и не съм толкова добър, но се надявам да си представиш как става. А за центъра на тежеста, просто се накланяш в обратна посока от която си дошъл.   Малко тъпо го обеснявам, но е много просто да се направи. Ако искаш да се върнеш обратно, просто променяш центъра към посоката от която си дошъл."

ANormalDayInRussia,39reez,Ilostmyredditlogin,8,Sun Jun 14 14:59:19 2015 UTC,"No, all my German friends are convinced that Russians are homophobic rednecks that are going to kill you if you openly proclaim that you're a woman or gay. Russians are also very poor, live in slums, drink vodka all day and die from alcohol poisoning or while crossing the road, before the age of 40.   And there's no way to change their minds because whenever I show them pictures and videos of real russia they just label them of as propaganda and much rather listen to our objective German TV channels."

I'm into all that stuff, combat footage and all the news regarding it etc, /r/syriancivilwar is one of my favourite subs. However, I had to unsub from /r/UkrainianConflict because it's just too damn biased and a complete circlejerk a lot of the time. I don't support any side in this conflict, but saying something that isn't pro Ukraine gets downvoted to hell and back. It doesn't even have to be pro Russia, as long as you aren't calling for the death of Putin you will be downvoted. It's an echo chamber really. I've said things like that a few pictures of some tyre tracks from satellites not being enough evidence to prove Russia invading Ukraine and I got 40 odd downvotes. Even something pro-Daesh in /r/syriancivilwar wouldn't be downvoted as much."
ANormalDayInRussia,39frp5,Duke0fWellington,2,Thu Jun 11 19:40:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the bias is huge. But people feel strongly about it and I feel that they should do. If they didnt care I'd be more concerned.   I am quite worried about the Russian perogative. Their country is on the verge of financial collapse, Oil and Gas is in tatters (I work in the industry, things are awful), public relations are very low. I just don't really understand them.

ANormalDayInRussia,39frp5,StiffyAllDay,2,Thu Jun 11 19:49:47 2015 UTC,"Actually the economy seems to be on a small rise, the crisis has forced a lot of Russians to find home alternative to foreign products, thus making a small step at some much needed diversification. This is of course only prevalent with small-medium sized businesses.  It should however be said that the small rise, could be correlated to the small rise in the oil price."

ANormalDayInRussia,39frp5,SomalianMillionaire,2,Thu Jun 11 22:24:14 2015 UTC,"Their currency is the best performing currency in 2015, as is their stock market. I work in the oil industry too.  With the CAD = 0.81 USD, most tar sands projects are making a profit when oil is above $55 as it is now.  Things have slowed down and unprofitable operations are being shaken out.   Things are even better in Russia, where production costs are in rubles.  The big oil and gas projects in Russia aren't  slowing down. American and Japanese companies are snapping up the business that Europeans cut themselves out of."
ANormalDayInRussia,39frp5,man_with_titties,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:54:48 2015 UTC,"Things are even better in Russia   They aren't if things carry on, for every $1 under ~$100/barrel they lose about $1.2bn. A lot of their economy relies on Oil, and right now it is in a precarious position. Lets see how their deficit is at the end of 2015 if things stay like this.    I work in the oil industry too   Possibly a different sector, I am in the offshore (mainly) oil and gas platform design and engineering. There is NO work out right now. The company I work for has shrunk from ~800 people to ~200. And their are now redundancies to staff, which is massive. None of the lads that left are in work. The projects simply aren't going ahead at this price.   American and Japanese companies are snapping up the business that Europeans cut themselves out of.   Once again, possibly different sectors? Because this is far from the case in what I do. Europeans and Koreans win it all. My company is American owned, but for the past 5 years we have got the bigger projects in the UK off our own backs. Companies like Aker and Kvaerner in Norway are booming, especially with the only job going, Johan Sverdrup which is profitable down to ~$35/barrel. Same situation with KBR as mine too. But now, both sides of the Atlantic are in trouble.  My company can normally win work on the cheap, and do it very well, we undercut Aker by $100m to win this job and it has gone fine. But with only one month left till handover, time to worry."

ANormalDayInRussia,39frp5,StiffyAllDay,2,Fri Jun 12 13:14:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the kurt reply.  Didn't have time for a longer one.   To expand. I'm in Alberta, working in construction of tar sands plants. For the past 15 years, this sector has been hyper-active. Looking at the big picture, the environment, community building etc. a slow down could be a good thing. (When I'm building these giant projects, I sometimes wonder who is going to do the dismantling a few decades from now.)  The Steam Assisted Gravity Drain producers are typically breaking even at $55/barrel with our dollar at 0.81 US.  The economics of a plant are never really known till it is built. Some plants turn out to be more productive than projected and some not.  There is always a risk. At current prices, there have been a few projects delayed but others are too far committed.    Husky cancelled one of their big projects - kicked Saipem off site with tons of steel and piping already half way erected.  Saipem also got kicked off Cdn Natural Resources Ltd. but that was another issue.  CNRL's next phase is continuing and the work went to other contractors. KBR is very busy building another upgrader.  Saipem may be so big that even Putin can't cancel their projects, but here they are newcomers and don't really understand how we do things , hence the CNRL cancellation.  In the past few years, there has been a severe shortage of skilled labour. Construction at the tar sands location has been done with a lot of help from the Atlantic provinces.  This changed the travel schedules so that work there was not very attractive to local workers like myself.  No worries, there was plenty of work in Edmonton at the module yards.  Even here, the companies were relying on large numbers of foreign workers - engineers and iron workers from the USA, pipefitters from Poland, Portugal, and Mexico.    At this point, it's the out of province workers affected most.    Apparently, the drop in oil prices affects the Baaken shale gas projects in neighbouring  Saskatchewan and North Dakota more, but that's just what I read in the papers.    We're far inland so I don't know much about offshore drilling.  There was a company building drill rigs for the Caspian Sea and flying the parts out on Ukraine's giant Antonov cargo plane.  I have no idea if that is continuing.    Canada is a lot like Russia.  When one industry is slowing down, another is booming.  In the 70s it was hydro-electricity. Gold in the 80s.  Diamonds in the 90s.  Oil in the millennium.  I should be worried about the slow down in oil, but my roots are in gold.  I really wouldn't mind taking a break from the tar sands and going back to the far north for gold again."

Mind you, almost everything of value inside was stripped for parts years before we got there. I suspect that the important equipment like the instrument panel and whatnot was removed when the plane was being decommissioned. Having kids tear at it for another twenty years finished the job. By the time we got in, there was nothing but the hull left.  The most puzzling thing is actually how the cockpit ended up in its present spot. It's located in a ""closed town"" (you need permission from the government to enter) in the middle of nowhere, many miles away from any aeroports, both military and civilian. Apparently, someone influential enough to appropriate a plane cockpit and get it into the town thought that it would make a nice playground decoration."

You don't go to the store to buy a new one. You steal it from your neighbor. Like literally, from next door neighbor. Then he will either take it back or steal from someone else. And it will keep going until someone will go and buy a new one or just decides that they don't need the light that much. Quite a few floors in my apartment building were in complete permanent darkness because of it. My dad once decided to put fluorescent light out there. After two hours it was gone. What people do the the elevators in their own fucking building is another horror story.    Some people would put harness around their light bulb with a lock. Only to find that bulb was smashed.

Pour out 1/3 of the powder from each cartridge. Put the bullets back in. Discard any bullets where the cartridge got deformed by the pliers.  You should now have sub-sonic rounds that are still powerful to shoot through some light metal like an oil drum or through the flesh of an unarmoured human chest.  They won't make much noise.  Your automatic or semi-automatic rifle will also work like a bolt action because the round will not produce enough gas to power the return mechanism and chamber the next round.  Experiment till you have found the right powder load or consult someone who actually knows something about loading ammunition.

ANormalDayInRussia,38ugms,brezhnervous,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:02:27 2015 UTC,"Loading subsonic rounds would not be good for hunting.  They would have no range.  I was thinking more about sneaking around killing bad people in a Mad Max post apocalyptic situation.  In Canada, a basic gun license allows one to own certain semi-autos like the SKS. Our native militias, the Rangers, are finally replacing their bolt action Lee-Enfields with some kind of automatic or semi-auto rifle. Ranger members are allowed to take their guns hunting so that will actually increase semi-auto usage.  Whatever they replace them with, it will not have the range of a bolt action 303."

This is just a piece of steel, and a (what seems like) a much larger caliber weapon.   http://i.imgur.com/2WXdZpW.gifv  Wooooww, what a massive recoil. Everything you said was completely wrong. Bullets don't actually hit very hard. You'll get a nasty bruise and the wind knocked out of you by a 9mm, at best. (Wearing body armour.)  A .45 caliber pistol may begin to break ribs, but discussing the ""punch"" behind different calibers is for an entirely different subreddit."
ANormalDayInRussia,38ugms,toxic9813,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:03:27 2015 UTC,would be interesting to see what the effect is to a skull inside that helmet.
ANormalDayInRussia,38ugms,dokid,12,Sun Jun 7 01:35:21 2015 UTC,"because that's a layer of fabric and nothing else. Get shot in a plate carrier instead, the same material that they use for helmets like this, and it might wind you. Getting shot in the head like this is obviously a bit more serious, but these helmets are indeed designed to take handgun rounds like that. It's very unlikely it would kill him. US military ballistic helmets are designed to take 9mm without killing you or leaving you disabled.  Also, have you never fired a gun before? Only something like .50 caliber has a large enough shockwave where it would effect the camera. 9mm or whatever handgun caliber he is using would never effect the camera."
ANormalDayInRussia,38ugms,TylerDurdenisreal,2,Sun Jun 7 03:21:37 2015 UTC,"Only time I've felt a gun standing near it smaller than a .50cal is people with crazy muzzle breaks. Always hate standing near them at the range because it tends to mess with anything not held down on the benches beside them. They are also loud as hell to people around them, and they tend to be the people that let brass fly without noticing who it's hitting. My 30.06 and my .44 magnum don't cause any shake to cameras right nearby. I have videos of other people firing them. No way a 9mm does.  .50cal is weird. It's not as outright loud sounding as being near someone near a muzzle break, but you can feel when someone fires one. Even from a few lanes away it's like your insides wiggle just a bit in a slightly disturbing way. You don't feel it nearly as much as their wallet does though at $5+ a round."

However this theory lends no necessary individual safety. Considered a form of attribution, the individual assumes that others either are responsible for taking action or have already done so.  The phenomenon tends to occur in groups of people above a certain critical size and when responsibility is not explicitly assigned. It rarely occurs when the person is alone and diffusion increases with groups of three or more.

This class of military hovercraft is, as of 2012, the world’s largest, with a standard full load displacement of 555 tons.   The hovercraft is designed to sealift amphibious assault units (such as marines and tanks) from equipped/non-equipped vessels to non-equipped shores, as well as transport and plant naval mines.  There are currently seven Zubr-class hovercraft in active service worldwide with several pending delivery. There are two vessels in service with the Russian Navy, one in service with the Ukrainian Navy, and four with the Hellenic Navy.  In 2009, China placed an order for four vessels from Ukraine as part of a deal worth 315 million USD.  Two of the vessels will be built in Ukraine whilst two will be license-built in China.   The purchase of Kefallinia (L-180) for the Hellenic Navy marked the first time a Soviet-designed naval craft had been built from new for a NATO member.

Malchik became a popular station ""resident"" among rail employees and commuters, and defended his territory against drunks and other dogs.  Malchik was killed when a 22-year-old woman Yulia Romanova stabbed him with a kitchen knife.  Later it was revealed that Romanova has a long history of cruelty to animals and psychiatric treatment.   The incident sparked a wave of public outrage regarding the treatment of animals, and, in 2007, a monument was erected in Malchik's honour at Mendeleyevskaya station.

ANormalDayInRussia,38by1e,Digipete,3,Wed Jun 3 19:44:18 2015 UTC,"This is how I had to fix the turn signals on my car for like six months. I thought for sure that there was something wrong with the cables, because the bulbs would work fine when hit (so they weren't burned out) and reseating the bulbs didn't help either. Finally I got fed up when it got harder and harder to get them to come back on, so I took one of the bulbs out and examined it. The filament had come undone on one side and was just dangling, and apparently hitting the light was enough to bounce the filament into the right position.  TL;DR if it doesn't work try hitting it."

I had a love/hate relationship with that viehicle.. but the one I got after that... the whole ignition died, so it was hotwired and you had to bungie the key into an on position, there were bolts in all the tires that the heat melt sealed so didnt bother getting new tires, like 1 brake pad that worked. You had to disconnect the battery at the terminal to get it to shut off, a cracked block so you had to drive with the heater on full blast and windows that you couldn't roll down.

Some would say country's like Brazil have the hottest girls (mixed, best of both worlds and all that). It's OBJECTIVE.

ANormalDayInRussia,37y9dw,maxikov,2,Mon Jun 1 07:29:11 2015 UTC,Must be very inefficient
ANormalDayInRussia,37y9dw,TommiH,5,Sun May 31 16:20:11 2015 UTC,The tank has a 40 liter diesel engine. It has 253 gallon fuel tanks and it's range is 280 miles which means that it's gets 0.9 mile/per gallon (251 liters per 100 km). Lets be generous and make it twice as efficient when you dismantle the armor.   Large tractors have 6-8 liter engines. The fuel consumption is not rated in travel distance but in hours of operation so it's difficult to find a number. My guess is that a modern tractor with no load would get somewhere between 15 miles per gallon (15 liters per 100 km).
ANormalDayInRussia,37y9dw,aykontakt,6,Mon Jun 1 07:12:29 2015 UTC,"15 liters per 100 km   I think, your tractor is called pickup truck. Small one."

ANormalDayInRussia,37y9dw,Holokaustinen,2,Mon Jun 1 12:54:55 2015 UTC,The tank does a better job than the tractor's simply because it can plow a wider swath and do it faster. The tractor uses less fuel but can't plow as wide or as fast .tank takes two hours while tractor takes all day

In Russia, calling someone ""black"" has more negative connotation. ""Negro"" is the most commonly-used term.  If I had to guess, I'd say it's because Russia is so large and old, so it's very common to refer to different ethnic groups like the like the Tartars, Chechens, & Uzbeks by name rather than just calling everyone ""white."" Furthermore, different colors carry strong emotional meaning. For instance, the Russian words for ""red"" and ""beautiful"" are very similar. Hence Red Square, the Red Army, etc. Black is commonly associated with evil & despair in Russian literature."

The spokeswoman said that they didn't find blood within the bear enclosure but on the sidewalk outside which they followed but the trail soon faded. They wondered how he got out of the enclosure because those things are easier to get into than to get out of. Some witnesses said that he had an accomplice that stayed outside of the enclosure so maybe he had some help.  The bears that live in that enclosure are old rescued female circus bears, the one in the picture is Sabina and she is 32 which is old for a bear. The woman said that she doesn't consider this a bear attacking a human but the other way around and the bear female was just defending herself. They are planning to discontinue the use of this enclosure because it's just not safe for the bears.   OK, she didn't say that last part about the enclosure not being safe for the bears."

ANormalDayInRussia,37b4ta,SrpskaZemlja,2,Sun May 31 19:31:14 2015 UTC,"""Само-"" is prefix meaning ""self"", ""-лёт"" is root of verb ""летать"" (to fly). So when you combine it, you get something like ""self-flying"" or ""flying by itself"" (autonomously).  Consider another example: samovar (самовар), it has the same prefix ""само"" and root ""вар"" from the word ""варить"" (to boil/brew). So when you combine it, you get something like ""self-boiling"" (self-brewing). This ""device"" is used for making hot beverages. It consists of internal tube where one puts hot coals and external ""pot"" where one puts water and brewing (tea or some other drinkable grass). Something like kettle but with fire from within.  Actually, there are pretty many words with the prefix ""само-"" and most of them refer to ""selfness"" or ""autonomy""."

ANormalDayInRussia,377e1n,elosoblanco90,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:43:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed. What's funny is in Atlanta in particular, while the city is very open towards gays, the state of georgia is not so friendly, and most politicians even in the city aren't very friendly towards gays. HOWEVER when the Olympics came into town the city council wanted to push out the poor black people and clean up the city to make it look presentable and beautiful for the international stage, so they literally created tons of incentives for homosexuals the move in to these dilapidated neighborhoods and gentrify them. Sure enough, now some of the most beautiful and disireable neighborhoods to live in Atlanta are where the gays initially moved into. Added to that you can tell that the neighborhoods used to be shit. In 2008 on the east side of Atlanta there were foreclosed houses that were no shit going for 10,000 because they were foreclosed and condemned buildings, and on average I would say the housed so were going 40-50k. Now in those same neighborhoods the average price is right around 250k-300k, with some topping over 500k for these relatively small houses. But with the gays they brought in good businesses, good shopping amd restaurants etc. there's re very very few filthy gay people"

To answer your question directly, he didn't state an opinion.  He pointed out that I was odd.  Oh, well... that's great??  And?  Is that a bad thing?  Good thing?  He didn't state anything.  He observed society and looked back at me and said 'you're odd,' though he didn't do it without some weighted value behind it, because he indeed holds that value of peer observation as his own personal moral judgement in which to dispense and judge upon me.

ANormalDayInRussia,36uu6q,AgainWithRestarting,3,Fri May 22 17:36:43 2015 UTC,"Delirium tremens:        ""DTs"" redirects here. For the initialism, see DTS (disambiguation).   Delirium tremens (Latin for ""shaking frenzy"", also referred to as DTs, ""the horrors"", ""the bottleache"", ""quart mania"", ""ork orks"", ""gallon distemper"", ""the zoots"", ""barrel fever"", ""the shakes"", ""the 750 itch"", ""pint paralysis"") is an acute episode of delirium that is usually caused by withdrawal from alcohol, first described in 1813.   Benzodiazepines are the treatment of choice for delirium tremens.   Withdrawal from sedative-hypnotics other than alcohol, such as benzodiazepines, or barbiturates, can also cause seizures, delirium tremens, and death if not properly managed. Withdrawal from other drugs that are not sedative-hypnotics such as caffeine or cocaine do not have major medical complications, and are not life-threatening.  Withdrawal reactions due to physical dependence on alcohol are the most dangerous and can be fatal. They often lead to physical effects including shivering, palpitations, sweating and, in the most extreme cases, convulsions and death if not treated.

ANormalDayInRussia,36mkqp,budihartono78,11,Thu May 21 14:10:06 2015 UTC,"Because US doesn't act in Russia's interest, rather simple. For example, NATO is an alliance to counter Warsaw Pact, yet it still exists even after Soviet Union fell and slowly creeping to Russia's doorstep. Ukraine was simply the last straw, so they burn bridges to make sure that Ukraine will stay in long conflict and will be too economically taxing for EU or NATO to take.  Russia proposed to join NATO few times before, and was rejected, put two and two together you'd see that NATO is still opposing Russia. So no wonder they don't like NATO (US included).

As for your assumption that opinion polls are fake - generally when an election is held, the professional polling institutes are pretty close in predicting the results.  I used the example of the victory parade, because you seem not believe these polls.  In that respect you are like the government my province just turfed out two weeks ago.

My country is going through hard times, and I believe that in order to overcome the difficulties, we must work hard and not to seek solace in past victories. And the current celebration of the victory is very similar to a feast during the plague (not sure that this expression has a semantic counterpart in the English language).

This cruelty, torture prisoners.  And now imagine that every day, every year the TV tells you that here's these horrors, as if they were, I guess. But most importantly, we have taken, and won, and still win. There is always someone who wants to deprive us of our vodka and caviar. And we will win it, because our cause is just.  That is the very same 87% Because they want to believe, they run from the ugly reality in the patriotic dreams. There is one aspect, but to understand it is necessary to know the history of the USSR before the World War II. You hardly know her, and I am a bad teacher.

ANormalDayInRussia,36o85e,true_rpoM,1 point,Sat May 23 16:35:37 2015 UTC,"Yes I know some of that history - found a book called ""it happens in Russia"" by a survivor of the pre-war gulags.  It only had one printing because in the 50s nobody wanted to talk about all the DPs who got sent back after the war. I gave that book to a Volga German born in Magadan - figured it was part of his family history.  Grew up with children of Hungarian and Czech refugees - heard all the horror stories - which have nothing to do with present situation in Russia. Currently there is a larger proportion of the population of the USA incarcerated than the proportion of Russian population incarcerated under Stalin. With 5% of the world's population, the USA holds 25% of its prisoners.  (key words- privatised prisons, secret arrests, Homeland Security) When Russians talk about why they like Putin, it is because he saved them from the social breakdown, Mafia rule of the 90's.  My territory was doing a lot of business with the Sakha Republic back then, so I got lots of stories from people, including the Magadan guy who went back there."
ANormalDayInRussia,36o85e,man_with_titties,1 point,Mon May 25 15:58:22 2015 UTC,"It's not about the number of prisoners. It's about the fact that 87% of voters voted for Putin not really for Putin, but because ""The rest is even worse.""  All internal policy aims to prevent the emergence of a public person, at least one third of the popular Putin. If a person starts to rise - it simply destroy politically, and if necessary, and physically too. All media somehow controlled (and if not controlled, you can always take away a license, like Clear Channel). All politicians (if they want to live well and quietly) are loyal to Putin. And a man that has no access to the Internet (such as, unfortunately, the majority) simply is not possible to obtain alternative information. And when the output appears his view already formed by propaganda, and alternative points of view for him, ""the machinations of the West"" and ""liberal nonsense."" The average man in the street really believe that's what you want to deprive him of his simple belongings and put nuclear warheads in his yard.   And the idea that Russia is actually in a pretty miserable situation of the country from which you sell resources at the man in the street does not arise.  And you're wrong if you think that the Mafia somewhere has got :) Just no longer accepted directly to rob people, it's rough. Who thrives theft from the budget, and the astronomical sums. For example, came into effect a law that I have to pay monthly contributions to the fund capital repairs of housing, which is contrary to a number of other laws. The founder of the fund - the company which is not responsible for anything at all, including the safety of money. It is chaos, but the chaos will bring someone good money."

Its designation stood for mobile, high power. After its first criticality in 1967, MH-1A was towed to the Panama Canal Zone that it supplied with 10 MW electricity from October 1968 to 1975.

It introduced the concept of people who were 'enemies of workers'. Under this writers, along with academics, scientists, and other intellectuals could be arrested basically for opposing Stalin's government.   This is similar to government actions during the Cultural Revolution in China, and the Cambodian Genocide led by the Khmer Rouge where intellectuals, scientists, writers etc. were often targeted as enemies of the government/revolution/workers.

ANormalDayInRussia,36772p,grshirley,1 point,Sun May 17 18:54:21 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Well in case you were still wondering, it was more that these were 'intellectual' prison camps, as compared to the gulags for forced menial labor, rather than specifically 'science' camps."
ANormalDayInRussia,36772p,fightingkoi,1 point,Sun May 17 19:12:07 2015 UTC,Why would the authorities care about putting the intelligentsia somewhere with better conditions though?  Engineers/scientists - sure you can use their labour/ideas.  Authors?    I'm guessing the authorities weren't actually hoping anyone would write a great novel so it seems a bit odd that they were treated better than the poor schmucks in the serious labour camps.
ANormalDayInRussia,36772p,grshirley,1 point,Sun May 17 23:43:25 2015 UTC,"Well, I fully admit, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn is the one Russian author I know the most about who spent time in one of these camps, as well as in other gulags. Hopefully someone else who knows more can give you more info. : /  For him, he started in labor camps, was transferred to a sharashka, then to a third kind of camp for political prisoners. He did go to University for mathematics, so it could be for that reason he was sent to the sharashka. Lev Kopelev served in the sharashka with Solzhenitsyn (who based a book character off him), and his background did not include any technical skills. He had done propaganda though before the war, and had German language skills. As best as I can tell from some quick research into him, he also served time in a gulag.   Reading some accounts of other prisoners at this same time, it sounds like only a very few prisoners were sent to the sharashka's, no matter their backgrounds. The rest went to various forms of labor camps. So I guess in the end, it was probably on a case by case basis, and in general, the Soviet authorities did not care about treating the majority of the intelligentsia better than other prisoners.

You're making children think that they can accept a foam-chemical-food crap slave society, and you're working for the very system which wants to enslave and sicken everybody. You should be ashamed of yourself for being a part of the US lie-conquer-and-destroy process of propaganda.  You're making children think that they should tolerate the US's many abuses because of something imaginary which doesn't exist.  You're doing the world a disservice by beating the dead horse while satan's stallion of US greed and enslavement is is trotting accross the world and destroying everything which was good and replacing it with the US system of enslavement."

ANormalDayInRussia,364gvv,idigporkfat,4,Sat May 16 20:56:14 2015 UTC,"This is the typical color shift from aged E-6 process films.   E-6 was a process developed by Kodak for color slides. When freshly processed the colors were brilliant especially in the blues, greens and violets. However the color was not terribly stable.  Their k-14 process, better known as Kodachrome, was a far more complicated process requiring actual chemists to perform. The colors favored warm yellows, reds, and flesh tone came out very nicely. This process was EXTREMELY stable to the point where slides from the 1930s still look stunning.  On top of being a very complicated process, Kodak never released the details of this process to the public or it's competitors. Instead it created the simpler, and noticeably inferior E-6 (aka Ektachrome) color system in order to avoid threats of anti-trust action by the US government.   E-6, though still somewhat complicated, could be done in a home darkroom, and easily managed in small labs all over the world. It became the natural choice for Agfa, Sakura, Fuji, Farrania, Ilford and other non-US film manufacturers.   If it were C-22 color negative film, it would have shifted to a ghastly red, and if it were the more modern C-41, it would have shifted to a sickly green.  If it were Polaroid, it probably would involve a naked American girl with big hair and possibly a line of coke...And also be blurry."
ANormalDayInRussia,364gvv,demux4555,2,Sat May 16 13:14:40 2015 UTC,"Well, if a chemistry used for developing the film was incorrectly prepared and/or expired, the result could be even worse. Not to mention that some films from the Eastern Bloc had horrible quality, google ORWO."

ANormalDayInRussia,35y2tg,daimposter,1 point,Thu May 14 20:00:16 2015 UTC,Not really. Only the dampener is the shock absorber. It absorbs the initial shock from the road as the compressed gases resist rapid changes and  combats and dampens the otherwise sinusoidal oscillation of the spring. The whole system is just called suspension.
ANormalDayInRussia,35y2tg,C-C-X-V-I,3,Fri May 15 07:59:35 2015 UTC,Sounds British...must be right.

ANormalDayInRussia,35y2tg,letz,11,Thu May 14 17:02:12 2015 UTC,I'm only assuming but I work on vehicles for a living so here it goes.  The vehicle could have been on jack stands with the suspension hanging loose. This would allow the spring (that isn't a shock) to extended out to its longest travel still installed. This would give ample room for the cat to climb in.  Then someone lowered the vehicle down and didn't see the cat. The cat just huddled up scared and then was stuck.  The reason they had the spring compressors on the spring was likely because of the way the suspension is designed. Even extended at it's longest travel it is still under pressure and removing it without compressing it may cause it to come out violently. So compress it and get it out safely and then remove the cat.

ANormalDayInRussia,35ult8,breakone9r,2,Thu May 14 05:47:51 2015 UTC,"This one did.  No one is certain, but the most likely cause was a backfire in the engine compartment.  My exhaust manifold was not fully attached (she was in desperate need of exhaust work by this time...) and we think the spark may have lit up the sound proofing on the underside of the hood.  I was working on a paper route at the time.  That kind of work is rough on a car, especially when there's as many dirt roads as my route had.  Couple with the fact that there's no holidays, and 7 days a week, 365 days a year...  I did have a couple hundred in the bank that I was planning to use to have her completely rebuilt, but she died before I could pull the trigger on that."

ANormalDayInRussia,35ult8,privated1ck,2,Thu May 14 01:43:33 2015 UTC,"Wikipedia showing that at elevated temperature and pressure, or  in the presence of a catalyst, NOS is quite flammable:   Nitrous oxide can also be used in a monopropellant rocket. In the presence of a heated catalyst, N 2O will decompose exothermically into nitrogen and oxygen, at a temperature of approximately 1070 °F.http://spg-corp.com/nitrous-oxide-safety.html Because of the large heat release, the catalytic action rapidly becomes secondary as thermal autodecomposition becomes dominant. In a vacuum thruster, this can provide a monopropellant specific impulse (Isp) of as much as 180 s. While noticeably less than the Isp available from hydrazine thrusters (monopropellant or bipropellant with dinitrogen tetroxide), the decreased toxicity makes nitrous oxide an option worth investigating.  Nitrous oxide is said to deflagrate somewhere around 600 °C (1,112 °F) at a pressure of 21 atmospheres.[7] It can also easily be ignited using a combination of the two. At 600 psi for example, the required ignition energy is only 6 joules, whereas N 2O at 130 psi a 2500-joule ignition energy input is insufficient.[8][9]"

However, we were under the impression that we were allowed to enter that enter, as the actual border crossing was still 2km away. We interpreted the sign as a warning for the approaching border.

And how exactly would the crash of a plane be enough of a reason for someone to make up such an extensive and specific story about a group of russian border millitants?  I also noticed you reported this as a troll because you believe it's a BS or exaggerated story about Russians... as if this story is about Russian people in general, no it's the experience of a travelling group of four who were unintentionally trespassing near a border zone. And ""on many subreddits"", because one is many now?  Am I correct in assuming you are Russian? Or are you on the Estonian side of that border? Because I'd imagine nationality probably plays a considerable role when it comes to border-related issues.  You are, ofcourse, allowed to believe what you want to believe.

Yes.. one man hit me in the face because I don´t speak Russian and the other pretended he was going to strangulate me and pore boiling water over my head. Fortunately we were able to leave the military base after seven hours. Bad thing is my eardrum is broken because of the punch. Hope it recovers fast.   Well yes it´s our mistake -crime. But hitting someone and threating someone is illegal and a much bigger crime in my opinion. This is not the way you treat tourists / people!   Russia is a really nice and interesting country. Russian people are very nice and hospitable. This was just a bad experience. I hope to forget it soon. I would recommend everyone to visit Pechory. Its monastery is amazing.

This could not be further from the truth. Russians are still just ordinary people with a somewhat different culture and nation--that does not mean that normal Russians don't have a healthy sense of self-preservation.  This video is showing a particularly ridiculous individual--not someone just being ""Russian"". No ordinary Russian would react like that, they'd try to jump out of the way and/or react much more strongly. There are crazy people everywhere in the world."

ANormalDayInRussia,35f30u,roomnoises,18,Sat May 9 19:29:19 2015 UTC,"Well Op couldn't deliver, I think I can deliver instead.  I wasn't a complete gopnik by I was among them till 14-15 y.o. We used to fight yard vs yard using baseball bats, broken bottles and all that stuff, some of my classmates started smoking when they were 8-9 y.o. They started drink vodka at the age of 10. I did not but I was always in their company and as expected I was known as nerd.  I don't remember the actual moment when I decided that such life is not for me, probably when my classmate got caught during his flat-robbery attampt I don't know.  The first think I've did was looking for the better mates. At the age of 16 I went to 2nd best russian university (Saint Petersburg State University) for free education (it's sort of educational grand). I decided to leave it during my 2nd year as I realised that it won't help me in having a better future. Back at home I was working on a metal factory and was a part of local football hooligans. After a half a year without being sober I've realised that I have to change somthing in my life and I've ask my parents if we can afford my study abroad. It's still tough for my  family but now I'm living in Ireland studying music production. I'm still a rather rude guy by all means by I don't thinks that I'm any worser then average asshole.

Conversely, is it common at all for people to go the opposite way - not necessarily part of Gopnik culture but attracted to it at some point? Or is it a pretty inward-looking culture?   That's a good question. I never really thought about this, so I am not sure if I can answer 100% objectively. Gopniki are usually young(in their teens and early twenties), so I think they either grow out of this phase and get some sort of a blue collar job, or get in prison and become a part of criminal culture.   I read a blog who is written by a pretty smart person(a programmer with good math skills). He wrote that he was a gopnik back in his teenage years, but then he changed and now he has a successful programming career. So it happens.    Conversely, is it common at all for people to go the opposite way - not necessarily part of Gopnik culture but attracted to it at some point?    Since people become gopniks in their teens, and teenagers are prone to influence by their environment, I think it happens.     Also I'm sure I could google this and get a good answer but what is the educational system like there?   I don't remember the exact stats, but 50%+ of students study for free. Those who pay for college/university-level education pay a lot less than e.g. Americans. So no hefty student loans here.    Somewhat related to the social mobility question, how difficult would it be for a smart poor person to go to a good university?   It is very competitive, but it is possible.   Russia now has something like SAT(ЕГЭ in Russian). So most people get admitted based purely on this score.   However, there are many olympiads/contests. If you are not a good tester, but you're good in these olympiads/contests, you can get full score for the corresponding subject. E.g. if you have a 60% score on the standardized test in math, but you won an olympiad, you have an effective 100% score. And if you're really good(~top150 at the national level) you can get into any university for free.    if you're a poor tester as a teen you may never become a doctor   As a side note, I think doctor isn't really desired profession here, probably because doctors don't get paid a lot."

Not trying to be patronizing or anything, it's just that I view Russia similar to the US in the sense that a person can live a normal and fulfilling life without ever leaving the country or learning a new language.   Very true, The vast majority of Russians don't have an international passport(which means that they can't visit countries with an exception of some ex-USSR countries).   The basics of foreign language(e.g. English) are taught in school. I never really made a conscious effort to learn English, but I am a programmer, and it is pretty much required for programmer to have an above-average skills in reading English text(tons of documentation is in English). I never really made a deliberate effort in learning English, but I read a lot of stuff in English(mostly reddit), so it helped.   I also vastly prefer to watch movies/TV series with original audio track(undubbed) with Russian subtitles, so it helped too.    But what if they aren't really in the environment?   I don't think it is possible then. The culture of gopniki is a mix of street culture and criminal culture, so you have to be immersed there to become a gopnik. Also, gopniki don't like when people call them ""gopniki"", so if you call gopniki ""gopniki"" you're already insulated enough from this culture.   When I was a teenager, among our group of middle class kids, it was common to mock gopniks. People would act like a gopnik(squat, ask for a cigarettes/change, offer to drink a specific brand of a cheap beer), but it was always tongue-in-cheek/just for teh lulz.   As a follow up, how difficult and common is it for Russian students to study abroad? It probably depends on the country, so could you give any examples?   I think it is relatively rare, though two days ago I was chatting with a guy from Poland, and he said that he was under impression that 30% of students were Russian. I suspect that it is common among upper class(e.g. government officials or maybe business people).   Ah. Yeah, it's getting to be that way for doctors here too, at least judging from family anecdotes. Do you think that affects the quality of healthcare?   It probably does. The healthcare is provided by the state, and wages aren't high. I think the situation in private sector is better, and a common job perk in Moscow(at least in IT companies) is ""private insurance""(so if you need healthcare, you go to a private clinic instead of the state clinic).    I'm asking so many questions. Feel free to pick and choose which ones you want to answer because I know there are a lot!   It is a lot of fun to answer these questions! I'll be happy to answer more of them!"

So there are countries where subbing is the norm? I need to read about this!    Are there high rates of academics and professionals leaving the country?   I don't know if there are quantified estimates, but programmers are leaving the country at a steady rate.      Were the conditions (volatile exchange rate, lack of imports/export markets from sanctions) that bad for the every day person?   When it was happening, it was pretty scary, but in the end it turned out not catastrophic. The prices rose somewhat(probably like 10%-20%, but I didn't pay enough attention to measure this).   Did it lead to an uptick in educated/richer people leaving, and has that trend continued?   Again, I don't have anything quantifiable, but I have a feeling that it will result in many smart people leaving Russia. The immigration process isn't easy though, especially if you want to move to the US.  It takes at least a few months(and up to a couple years).   And another followup, have you thought of leaving?

ANormalDayInRussia,35f30u,SnowGabe,2,Mon May 11 15:15:40 2015 UTC,"I think I might be late but figured that I'd try anyways. Here are my questions, I'd be thrilled if you answer any of them because I'm really curious about the opinions of the Russian society as a whole: 1) What is the political atmosphere right now - do people genuinely like Putin or simply believe there is no other choice? How do people feel about the recent events with Nemtsov and Ukraine - supportive or neutral? 2) What is the perception of the former Eastern Bloc countries? 3) What is the general opinion of the 'West'? Does it differ from the general opinion about the USA? 4) Do Russian people read Western media and how do they feel about it (since it often presents as much, if not more, propaganda as the Russian media)? 5) Is Маша и Медведь popular in Russia? :D Thank you!  P.S.: I love your country; I wish I could understand Russian mentality and way of thinking more, it's absolutely fascinating."
ANormalDayInRussia,35f30u,kindnature,3,Tue May 12 20:04:49 2015 UTC,"Hi!   1) I think that before the Crimea thing people felt like there was no other choice, but now they probably genuinely like him(since his ratings are now sky high).  2) Neutral/Positive  3) Hostility, especially towards the US. I guess it has a lot to do with propaganda. People feel like Russia has its unique system of values(more traditional/conservative)  4) I am pretty sure that 99% don't read it. Most Russians don't know English well enough and aren't really inclined to seek that kind of information  5) ""Маша и медведь"" -- folk tale? I think it is pretty popular, I know the basics of the plot"

I'm British and I've always been really interested in Russia, but I never got a chance to go there (a Finnish communist once tried to get me to meet him in St. Petersburg for a celebration of the Russian Revolution but he was so forceful in trying to convince me to come I got wary and didn't go), I feel like even though our countries have usally been at loggerheads, there is a lot of similarities (if anything the conflict is precisely because of conflicts of interest between similar powers) - we're both peripheral members of Europe, in but also out, of course from different directions - and although I think there is something to be said for the differences between Maritime and Continental powers - I think that it can also be overstated a lot. But that's all ""government"" stuff. All the Russians I've met have come across to me as people that I could relate to as a Brit, they're more cynical than Americans like we are, they are even more reserved than British people in some ways... I dunno. But I also think people everywhere are not that different, we're all human after all.  If it ever happened that Europe and Russia fell into all out war again, how much do you think that the people in Russia would understand it's just governments fighting and that people on the other side are just people like them?"
ANormalDayInRussia,35f30u,chiroque-svistunoque,7,Mon May 11 16:52:53 2015 UTC,Ah sry OP I want to reply here as well :)  As far as I see OP is a liberal guy and I'm a 100% conservative guy so I think we just can give answers from different spectres of society.  a) Look mate I live in Ireland and I think that we are really really close to Irish :D So if you know irish people (and you know cause you are british) then you can get the general idea of russians.  b) We russians are cynical that's true. We are big fatalists as well. When people at this sub are surprised that russians don't give a fuck they need to remember that a lot of russians think that they can't change anything and everything is happens by the God (or fate for atheists) will.  c) I don't see big war anytime soon. Putin is not in a row with dictators of the 20's century. He is just a crime leader that accidentaly became a ruler of a country. He has nor balls nor wish to start any war. The situation in Ukraine could be solved with russian army stepping in even not to take ukraine or it's parts but just to control the situation like peacemakers. He is too afraid of doing even this. So there definetely will be no big war with Putin.  Also we have nothing against europe. Still a lot of people dislike americans after all the propoganda but overall view on europe is sort of - they are nice guys just fooled by americans and controled with american military power.

Personally I think that Russians are just like people in other countries. I mean, there are cultural differences, but humans are humans everywhere in the world.   All the Russians I've met have come across to me as people that I could relate to as a Brit, they're more cynical than Americans like we are, they are even more reserved than British people in some ways...    It is an interesting observation! I didn't have a chance to meet enough Americans and Brits to make a meaningful comparison.    If it ever happened that Europe and Russia fell into all out war again, how much do you think that the people in Russia would understand it's just governments fighting and that people on the other side are just people like them?   I don't think Russian government would start a war without support of the people. And if there is a war, the would frame it as ""fighting against fascism"", ""protecting Russians living in other countries"", ""protecting national interests"" and ""protecting Russian world""(not sure if I translated this adequately). Russian propaganda machine works very well and it can easily distort the reality for the vast majority of the people.  After the events in Crimea , Putins approval ratings got sky high.

Russian propaganda machine works very well and it can easily distort the reality for the vast majority of the people.   It's interesting you say this but presumably you yourself are not one of them. I guess there is a lot of division along education levels too? Or is it less simple than that?  As an aside what do ""Muscovites"" like yourself think of all the stuff about Siberia and similar feeling exploited by Moscow? I guess a lot of that sentiment has been overridden by the recent growth of nationalism (convenient...)? Also what do you think about the balance between fighting corruption and giving regions more autonomy (which often seem to be goals at odds with each other)?  If things don't heat up too badly one day I hope to come and get to know your country first hand, so I really hope they don't, but I guess if they did then there will always be an aftermath - so in that case maybe 40 years from now instead of 2-3."

It's interesting you say this but presumably you yourself are not one of them. I guess there is a lot of division along education levels too? Or is it less simple than that?   Yeah, I am not one of them(or at least I'd like to think so :) ). I get most of my information from internet which is still very much free here. Most people get their information from state-controlled TV channels/newspapers which present news in a very specific way.    As an aside what do ""Muscovites"" like yourself think of all the stuff about Siberia and similar feeling exploited by Moscow?   Haha, actually I grew up in Siberia, and I wouldn't call myself a muscovite, though I've been living in Moscow for 6 years. I'd say there is some sentiment towards Moscow exploiting regions, but there is no major tension. ""Siberian nationalism"" is (almost) non-existent.   The biggest source of ethnic and inter-regional tension is North Caucasus(Chechnya, Dagestan, etc). These regions have ""non-Russian"" culture influenced by Islam/Sharia law. In 90s there were two separatist wars there.  EDIT: I never really thought about corruption vs autonomy. But I am pretty sure that while Putin has the power nothing is going to change about corruption."

They comprise the extant families Odobenidae (whose only living member is the walrus), Otariidae (the eared seals: sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (the earless, or true seals). There are 33 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils. While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic lineage (descended from one ancestral line). Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora and their closest living relatives are bears and musteloids (weasels, raccoons and skunks), having diverged about 50 million years ago.

Although originally introduced in the early 1980s, the idea was not substantially researched until decades later. In 2007, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation requested Intellectual Ventures LLC to find a way to fight and eventually end malaria. Intellectual Ventures resurrected the idea of using lasers to kill mosquitoes and now has a working prototype.  The idea has been criticized because most areas where malaria is prevalent do not have reliable electrical power.

Представившись Сомони Эмомали - сыном президента Эмомали Рахмона, Ученик 10 класса международной школы Душанбе Хушдил Курбонов получил $50 тыс. за обещание заключить земельную сделку. Помимо этого, школьник связался с одним из чиновников и потребовал немедленно решить вопрос с участком. ""Хушдил Курбонов позвонил Сабзали Маджидову и представил себя Сомони Эмомали, сыном президента, приказал ему выделить Махмадризо Раджабову земельный участок.

Obviously there are exceptions - an old DGU KVN sketch is infinitely funnier than most Adam Sandler movies - but the vast majority of what Russians consider funny is awful, unfunny, and dumb.  Example, a primetime gameshow, the goal of which is to make the judges smile ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire""-style, meaning that each turn carries the risk of losing progressively larger amounts of money if the judges don't laugh.  A guy shows up in fatigues and shades, but he's not a soldier.  In a bumbling simpleton fashion he starts reading jokes from his notes.    Joke #1 - ""what do you call a chicken ... if chicken ... teeth ... doesn't have"" [eruption of laughter].    Joke #2 - ""what is, what is sex ... you call"" [eruption of laughter].  The judges are dying.  Then one of the judges imitates the contestant's delivery back to the announcer.  Neither version is even a little bit funny.  Joke #3 - ""Armenian Radio: why ... doesn't ... the chicken ... have underwear ... because"" [eruption of laughter].  The judges are now splayed out across their table and the contestant won 100,000 rubles.  The audience is yelling ""Bravo"".  Joke #4 - ""A kid is asking ... his father ... why ... the Earth"".  Judges are dying from laughter again.  Joke #5 - ""One chicken says to the other ... I had such a hot night, all my eggs are hard-boiled"".  Silence.  Then laughter.  The contestant wins 1,000,000 RUR ($20,000 USD).  Anton Chekhov, Ilf and Petrov, and a couple of other classics are funnier than this fucking drivel.  Any Monthy Python sketch beats the shit out of what passes for humor in Russia."

Soviet comedies and tragicomedies are awesome. russian ""comedy"" shows and movies? they make me want to set myself on fire (comedy club shudder).   Soviet humour was very witty and tongue in cheek. The writers really had to be creative and use their brain to write good jokes, because they couldn't just rely on mere mentioning of sex and poop. That is also one of the reasons why soviet comedies are often citated and became, well, memetic. i can't name you a single russian skit i can cite, probably because they are not worth remembering. Brain bleach is what goes best with concurrent russian comedy. That said, there are a couple of russian movies that genuinely made me laugh - Ширли-мырли and о чем говорят мужчины For example."

I also never lived in the US, so I only know the American stereotypes from reddit. I think that it's not such a stigma as US, mainly because Russians aren't a minority in Russia, and also because in Russia it is not connected with poor people, poor education or poor areas. So you'll hear people complain that ""we are a country of single mothers, a country of same-sex families: mother+grandma, a country of mothers with children from three different men and men leaving their wife and kids to raise some other man's kids"". But the people they are complaining about will have college degrees and jobs, and so there's no real stigma attached to leaving your children, "" it happens to the best, he must have had his reasons""."

That's a very common situation because retirement age in Russia is very early (55 years) and so a grandmother is often retired already and can look after the children while the mother goes to work. The phrase is sarcastic, of course. Usually people will say this when criticizing the gay bashing by the state media.

I have this song in Ukrainian, White Russian and Russian and I remember someone telling me that there's a traditional Polish version of the text, too - but I'm not quite sure about how to find it, because my Polish is still very, very bad))) I fucking love Vopli Vidopliassova.

The name comes from Old East Slavic Русь (Rus'), and remains the same in modern Belarusian, Russian and Ukrainian. In Greek it is called Ρως (Ros) or Ρωσία (Rosia), in Armenian Ռուսաստան (Rrusastan), and in Latin Ruthenia or Russia. For more about the etymology, see Rus' (name).
