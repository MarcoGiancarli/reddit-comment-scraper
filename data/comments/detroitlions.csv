detroitlions,3e32qo,thages901,8,Tue Jul 21 16:09:34 2015 UTC,"At this point I don't really care about how different people have graded our offseason. I know what we've lost and I know what we've gained, I don't need people to tell me how bad it is losing Suh, I know it sucks and a lot of people here spent a lot of energy defending him. At the end of the day all that matters is how well this football team plays come the regular season, which all of us can agree on has the potential to be our best season yet. /  Detroit vs Everybody"
detroitlions,3e32qo,Found_my_username,13,Tue Jul 21 16:40:11 2015 UTC,"Meh, the author isn't wrong on the few points they make but they're not taking everything into account.   A non-flashy draft isn't a reason to say that it wasn't a good draft. The Lions don't need flash, they need to protect Stafford, and that's what they've done. The article doesn't even mention the Walker trade, the Ameer pick up, the fact that Ebron is poised to have a break out year, that Tulloch will be returning to the field, that Slay just continues to improve, that Ziggy is setting sights on being the best DE in the league..... So sure, if you just look at the dead cap space of Suh, the bandaid of Ngata and the fact that our draft wasn't ""flashy""; I'd give us a bad grade too. I could really care less what we get graded as anymore. The FO's number one priority was fixing the O-Line and that sits very well with me. Stafford has shown a lot of different faces since his 2010 year. We had the gunslinger, the conservative, the scrambler. He's got a lot of the right components to show us the combination of the three this year and with some time in the pocket. Well, I'm just excited to see what we get once it all starts to come together."
detroitlions,3e32qo,Kayoh44,3,Tue Jul 21 16:39:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're saying but this is an off-season grade based on the moves teams make during free agency and the draft, so a lot of what you're saying is good for the team, but not really relevant to what this guy is writing about."
detroitlions,3e32qo,Snes,5,Tue Jul 21 19:12:02 2015 UTC,"Well, we lost a generational talent in the prime of his career and did very little to improve the team in the long run.  Ngata is just a stopgap (a very good one obviously, but more than likely won't be here beyond 2015) and the rest of the free agent class is a bunch of guys no one's ever heard of.  Meanwhile the draft didn't garner a whole ton of attention, which is bound to happen when you draft a guard in the first round even if you need one.  People were expecting a DT or that CB that we're supposed to draft in the first round every single year and never do.  Not sure it warrants a D-, but it seems clear to me Detroit got worse in the offseason from a personnel perspective.  If they're going to get better it's going to be from growth of players who were already on the roster or from rookies.  It's still blatantly ridiculous to put us on the same level as San Francisco's disaster of an offseason."
detroitlions,3e32qo,RyanFuller003,2,Tue Jul 21 17:43:08 2015 UTC,"did very little to improve the team in the long run.    I could not disagree more.  This is one of those cases where doing nothing is better than doing something. Year after year, we have been stuck with a terrible cap situation that has occured from a combination of bad luck, a terrible CBA, and poor cap management. By letting Suh go we will head into 2016 with large amount of cap space and the ability to lock up some of our talented young players."
detroitlions,3e32qo,Balrog77,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:44:53 2015 UTC,"It's a fair enough point, but they also took a step backwards and I'm not sure they get credit for freeing up future cap space until they actually put it to good use, though.  It's going to be hard to spend that money on someone better than Suh, or even into two or three players that make up for his departure."

detroitlions,3e32qo,punkrawkintrev,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:28 2015 UTC,"Giving us a D- is obviously sensationalized horseshit based purely on the loss of Suh... however, at this point, I like that it only adds fuel to the (bon)fire: all these reporters harping the same tired narrative to fulfill their Shit-on-DET quota will only help us come the regular season. Our players know how great they are, individually and as a team, so pls, reporters, keep growing that chip on their shoulder! Apart from losing Suh our offseason has been solid and stable (can't say the same for the Pack, Bear or Vikes). Our D is still nasty and our O will start to kick ass. Bottom line: Everyone is underestimating the Lions this year BIG TIME, and I have no problem with that."
detroitlions,3e32qo,reubenheart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:23 2015 UTC,"I think it's a poorly written, clickbait, classic ""shit on the Lions"" assessment. The author plays both sides of the fence on the ""grading"". The article says that this specific offseason is a D-, but in the very first sentence says that this is because of years of salary mismanagement. Try to fix the salary management? D-. Had the Lions overspent on Suh and Fairley, they would have graded this offseason a D- for that instead."
detroitlions,3e32qo,MisterFabulous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:44 2015 UTC,Fuck the Detroit Free Press. Fairley was a STRAIGHT UP BUM. Fuck the Freep
detroitlions,3e32qo,chefcurrywithdashot,2,Tue Jul 21 18:58:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we lost Suh in part due to years of cap mismanagement but overall we had a decent free agency.  Picking up Haloti Ngata and Tyrunn Walker will really help fill the void left by Suh.  On top of that, we had a really good draft with Laken Tomlinson and Ameer Abdullah, two day one starters, and Quandre Diggs and Gabe Wright who should be day one role players.  Even Corey Robinson is considered to be a big value pick in the seventh round.  On top of all of this, resigning Matt Prater shores up a kicking game that certainly lost us one, possibly two games last year.  Additionally the pickup of Manny Ramirez is impressive because we were obviously targeting Tomlinson, but we got the player we wanted and insurance with an average to above average guard in the case of an injury to our offensive line.  Retaining Teryl Austin shouldn't add to our score, but it is very good for continuity in our defense while losing a key player.  So overall I would give us a B or B-.  The only negative thing that happened was losing Suh and Fairley.  I don't think it is fair to penalize us for losing Fairley, who was often injured and had multiple issues.  Losing Suh precludes us from getting an A but we covered for it extremely well and vastly improved our suspect offensive line.  Edit:  Also, how do the Seahawks get an A- despite not extending Russell Wilson, their most important player?  The Cowboys get a higher grade then us despite losing their star running back and not replacing him with anyone noteworthy?  It just seems like the grades are pulled out of a hat, not weighted very well."
detroitlions,3e32qo,Snes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:20:01 2015 UTC,"Pretty shocked they gave the Cowboys a C+  I mean what the hell?  They got 2 first round draft picks for literally the price of one in Collins, locked down Dez, picked up Hardy (who should be healthy and hungry in time for the post-season), the only thing that wasn't flawless was losing Murray, but Randle behind the best o-line in the NFL will still take a lot of pressure off.  They had one of the best offseasons, not one of the worst."

detroitlions,3dzs74,notanalbumcover,6,Mon Jul 20 21:21:18 2015 UTC,"It's clear that you've done you're research, but the OL grade was a bit high in my opinion. At LG and C, we have new starters this season (Swanson looked okay for the few games he filled in, but I'm still cautious about his abilities). Also Waddle's health issues are a bit concerning to me. Other than that, this is a great write up and would like to see more posts from you in the future."
detroitlions,3dzs74,AA-ZZ,2,Mon Jul 20 22:39:10 2015 UTC,Good guard play can make a centers life easy. But if we have a rotation at RT again it will make it hard on Warford which could affect center play. I agree it should be a B- now but they could be a A group but that will take time. Don't forget about Lucus or Williams at RT if Waddle can't stay healthy I don't they they are fulling counting on Waddle this season. I'm always interested to see a big TE that is converted to tackle because they are already athletic.
detroitlions,3dzs74,Nixus,2,Mon Jul 20 23:14:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the feedback!

Be safe, Detroit gets a bad rep but it isn't too bad. stay away from alleyways and don't trust people on the street (i had a friend get robbed high fiveing someone after a game) and dont go anywhere you dont have business going.

detroitlions,3drsqu,ThyHolyPope,3,Mon Jul 20 01:39:14 2015 UTC,"So as someone who didn't watch a lot of the lions as a kid growing up, and only sees Barry on highlight films, honest question:  I know he was one of the best ever, but did he get tackled for loss a loss a lot? i know he had huge plays all the time, and he broke tackles like no other, but it seems like his playing style (ei: often reversing field behind the line of scrimmage) would get punished alot too, I mean when they work, they're amazing (thus highlight reels) but when he'd get stopped seems like it'd be for pretty big losses... I guess i'm asking if he's kinda like Brett Farve (in his prime), amazing when hes good, while at the risk of losing big yards when hes not."
detroitlions,3drsqu,votebot9898,5,Sat Jul 18 21:30:16 2015 UTC,It has been said that you could make a highlight reel out of his one yard losses.
detroitlions,3drsqu,ajuicebox,4,Sat Jul 18 23:20:23 2015 UTC,I saw one once.  Even that was pretty amazing.    I will look for it.  Here's one.
detroitlions,3drsqu,rochford77,5,Sun Jul 19 14:55:25 2015 UTC,"Yes sir, but he did average 5 yards per carry for his career.  Also, as pointed out by another comment, our line was pretty bad for most of his career.  He had Lomas Brown and Kevin Glover for a while, but not much else.  So if he was reigned in, it probably would have been less productive.  One thing I would like to point out though, is it's not like Barry couldn't run people over.  He was a lot stronger than people thought.  He would do squats after the games.  I remember one game against the Giants where he ran over a linebacker to get a first down.  I don't remember who it was, but it wasn't LT or anything.  But still, everyone assumed because he was so shifty that he had no power.  He really did have power, it's just he had more agility."
detroitlions,3drsqu,penisbacon,3,Sat Jul 18 23:26:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, he was not a 4 yards every touch/move the chains kind back. More fast or famine. He often ran 40 yards to pick up 3. But man he was hard to get down."
detroitlions,3drsqu,nonsensepineapple,3,Sat Jul 18 22:15:33 2015 UTC,i believe he is the all time yard loss leader in nfl history for an RB.  it makes his career 5ypc average even more impressive.
detroitlions,3drsqu,rsresnor,5,Sun Jul 19 14:21:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, Barry was tackled for a loss often, Barry will even admit to it in interviews.  The Lions offensive line in the 90's wasn't the best in the league.  But Wayne Fontes, the Lions' coach, let Barry just do his thing and Barry and the team were able to reap the benefits.  After Fontes was let go, that changed.  I think that was the first step towards Barry's early retirement."
detroitlions,3drsqu,kyledeb,3,Sat Jul 18 21:53:12 2015 UTC,"He would lose a yard or two probably every other carry at least, but every 6 or 7 touches he'd do something incredible and pick up big yards.  Watching the Lions in those days was pretty much just a waiting game to see Barry make another big play.  Even his losses usually involved beating a few defenders.  That offensive line wasn't ever very good.  He carried that whole team and the coach just fed him the ball."
detroitlions,3drsqu,MenacingVitamin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:26:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't see him play much, but when I did this was my favorite part. It always took quite a few guys to take him down no matter what because of how quick he was, even if he didn't get far."

detroitlions,3dqp9h,MoonMan080,9,Sat Jul 18 15:07:29 2015 UTC,"I'm soooooper tired of the Suh/Fairley narrative.  Sub's loss will definitely be felt, but people seem to often forget that prolific players are only a portion of good scheme and I think we brought in enough talent to stand the defense up. Never mind that Austin took a mediocre to bad defense and made it a historically great one. We have the coach, we have the talent, we will have the defense.  The true question is the offense. Will the Oline improve and will Stafford step into the next tier of QBs? That's the x-factor here. Not our D.  And I say bunk to the Vikings having a better record than Detroit. They're a rising team with young talent, but lack the sideline support to push them to the next level.  The article was well written and I think you did a great job. It seems, however, to stand on the same platform as generic sports media.   We are not the ""same old Lions"" and we'll show you why in 2015."

Suh is a huge loss, but mentioning Fairley and Johnson in the same thought? No way. Fairley was hurt the majority of the season and honestly had very little impact towards the lions success. Johnson was a solid player but will not be the reason the lions regress (per your prediction). I don't know much about the other teams to extensively but a little more research would have helped with the lions prediction."

detroitlions,3dqp9h,Fuckn_hipsters,6,Sat Jul 18 20:39:34 2015 UTC,"I'll repost a comment I made before:   You shouldn't get stuck on names.  Suh, Fairley and Mosley were here before last year, and we had a meh run defense. The real star of this team on defense has a name, and we have him here. Teryl Austin elevated that unit, so if you ask many Lions' fans, we're happy with where we are.   Take a look at our defensive stats before last year, and this window you talk about starts to crumble, that defense wasn't winning a SB anytime soon. We've made shrewd acquisitions on defense, Tyrunn Walker is a new Nick Fairley, and Haloti Ngata will prove a solid replacement of Suh, we do have a DT rotation, unproven but if this far on the off-season we haven't signed anyone of note, I'll trust the FO on that choice.  Anyway, next year we'll have mounts of cap space available, and with the young core we have in place we'll be in the party in January.  Also Ebron is not a bust, and you'd have to be crazy to call him that."
detroitlions,3dqp9h,thabe331,6,Sat Jul 18 16:31:44 2015 UTC,"Fairley has been given far to much credit as far as his contribution goes. Sure he has tons of potential but is lazy and injury prone (probably, at least partially, due to the laziness). He really did not play enough to be considered the loss that your site, any many others, claim it was.  Also Teryl Austin had the same pieces that were there the year before and turned that D into one of the best in the league. The lack of respect that you guys have for his system and his ability to coach is a bit insulting. Austin returning was the most important off-season decision made by anyone wearing Honolulu Blue.  Another problem that stuck out to me is having 4 less wins would be much more than a little worse than last year, especially when the lions go from a playoff team to out. Saying the finishing 7-9 is a little worse is such a gross understatement that I question whether the writer knows what they are talking about."
detroitlions,3dqp9h,Spartanonymous,4,Sat Jul 18 16:16:55 2015 UTC,The lack of respect that you guys have for his system and his ability to coach is a bit insulting.    Detroit vs everybody
detroitlions,3dqp9h,thabe331,4,Sat Jul 18 22:04:40 2015 UTC,"On the Lions you missed other players added such as Tyrunn Walker from New Orleans who will play alongside Ngata in a 4-3 defensive alignment.  The Lions are not catering to Ngata.  Ngata is learning to play in defense unlike one he has ever played in before, which is a 4-3.     Another thing is that you think the Lions defense will suffer without Suh, but the truth is that we had Suh for the three seasons prior to Austin and hr didn't make the defense an elite defense.  Hell he wasn't even the defensive MVP as voted on by the players and coaches.  That would be Deandre Levy, who is the real star of our defense.  We will also be getting Stephen Tulloch back from injury so our defense will likely become even better in Austin's second season than in his first.  We also added depth at the cornerback position drafting Carter and Diggs with Lawson also coming back from injury.  Other than the flag against Dallas, it was our bad play by the 3rd/4th cornerbacks which cost us the game.  Our offense should also be much improved in Lombardi's second season calling the plays, and a revamped offensive line that was the weakest part of our team last season."

To add to your post, Tyrunn Walker while relatively unknown was a hot commodity, many teams wanted him including the patriots.   we had Suh for the three seasons prior to Austin and hr didn't make the defense an elite defense   He didn't' even make us an above average defense, we have been known for a while as a team that was carried by our passing game who can make a few plays on defense  I would argue that Lombardi's play calling in the second half of the playoff game is what lost us that game."
detroitlions,3dqp9h,thabe331,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:08:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I will at least partially agree with you on Lombardi but Terrance Williams made Cassius Vaughn look really bad and I attribute our defense, specifically our depth at cornerback that lost us that game.  We started the game with a quick lead, if our defense didn't give up those few big plays, specifically Williams, we would have won the game.  We had the lead then Dallas scored to take the lead on the drive before we had the refs pick up the pass interference flag.  If all draft picks and free agents can contribute their fair share, and Lombardi and Stafford are on the same page and can demand respect from the defense, then our run game gets 4.0+ ypc we should have a good chance at winning a playoff game or two or three or if we get the wild card four games"

The answer is no I think they would be picking top 5, but I can't argue with the prediction there is a number of ways the season can play out.  There will be a number surprises and upsets, and some unknown teams. da bears are the unknown team Fox is a very good coach they could be 4 to 10 win team know body knows and I wouldn't be surprised ether way. I think a Cowboys and Broncos are teams that will not make the postseason.

detroitlions,3dqp9h,AA-ZZ,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:50:44 2015 UTC,"If they have a decent backup there is no reason they can't go at least .500  In 2010 Rodgers missed 1 game with a concussion. Matt Flynn came in and lost against the 14-2 Patriots 31-27.  The next year Rodgers sat out and Flynn played the final game against the 10-6 Lions in that shoot out.   In 2012 Packers went 2-2 in games Matt Flynn started. The four teams he played against were 8-8, 8-8, 7-9, and 4-12.  Only a single loss of theirs was by more than a TD. This gives them a SOS of .531 for those 6 games, which would have been second highest last year.   So with a solid backup caliber, not even starting caliber QB Packers are competitive. It was only with the undrafted free agent QB who played like it that the Packers struggled."
detroitlions,3dqp9h,LaCW09,0,Sun Jul 19 22:40:00 2015 UTC,"2-5-1 that season without Rodgers and they where playing some cupcake teams. They started the season 5-2 with Rodgers and finish the season at what 8-7-1 that is a 500 record and Rodgers played in 8 of them accounting for 6 of the wins? I agree Falcons(4-12) and Cowboys(8-8 the cowboys where imploding in the second half lost 3 of their last 4 games) where great teams in 2013 the Packers two wins without Rodgers. The last game of the season against the Bears Rodgers had to make some amazing plays to win that game, without Rodgers Packers are not winning that game and would of had a sub .500 record. Also right now packers backup is a rookie, they won't be able to run the ball without Rodgers teams will just stack the box. The packers would see more 8 man box no more 6 man boxes for Lacey or Starks to run in. Packers don't have a good defense maybe middle of the pack, who is their pass rusher, I think the packers have a good secondary, but the LBers and Dline? Also the only team that the Packers lost to with a winning record without Rodgers was the Eagles."
detroitlions,3dqp9h,AA-ZZ,2,Sun Jul 19 23:28:25 2015 UTC,"Plus any team may collapse without their QB. Can the Lions win 8 games without Stafford.   Look at the Bears. 2011. Start out 7-3 under Cutler. He gets injured and they finish 8-8.   2012 Cutler missed two games. Bears went 0-2. Other 14 games they went 10-4.   Any of the teams probably won't get to 8 without their starting QB, even the Lions who start is average at best. Packers have at least shown to be competitive with a decent backup."
detroitlions,3dqp9h,LaCW09,0,Sun Jul 19 23:37:00 2015 UTC,"Can the Lions win 8 games this season with Stafford your answer was 7-9 so how can they win 8 games without him. There are some teams that can win without their starting QB Bengals, Seahawks. Their are teams that will be meh without their starting QB. And then there are teams that will fall apart without their starting QB like the Colts, and Packers. Packer where competitive with who without Rodgers, you bring up the Pats. That year the Packers had a really good defense too. Packers only lost to one winning team without Rodgers and your saying that they where competitive? Saying that they where competitive is what I hear from other Lions fans after a lost looking for a moral victory. Is the NFL a league of parity or not?"

If your answer is yes to Lion then Mayhew is a terrible GM paying franchise money to a replaceable player. Bears GM is unlucky for inheriting that. Vkes we will see.  If your answer is no then it is just wishful thinking that Stafford stays healthy and Rodgers gets injured.

Bears fan thinks they can't win with Culter now what good is a backup going to do? Maybe even some Bears fans are praying for the Backup to start. Vikings might be a team that could win with their backup they have a good defense and can run the ball. I never predicted the Lions to have a winning season I think 7-9 is about right, so they go 6-10 with their back up still a losing season. Why do you think that the Lions roster isn't good? I think they have a good roster, I'm worried about the age of the oline very young and that it might not gel this season but we will start see it the next season. And they do have a tough start to the season, and I don't believe in Caldwell as a game manager and think Joe Lombardi is not a good coordinator and maybe he shouldn't even be a coordinator. Plus the Lions never had have back to back 10 win season so history is on that side. Lions have the talent if you can't see that then your blind. Try listen to Move the Sticks with Daniel Jeremiah a former NFL scout now works with the NFL. He does a good job breaking down teams, players and talent. I would say he is unbiased about the Lions he never work for them and is not from Michigan. I don't know what we are arguing anymore, my point was that the Packers would have a losing season without Rodgers. Talent wise Lions have the better roster talent wise then the Packers. But what makes the difference is that Rodgers might go down as one of the best if not the best QB's of all time."
detroitlions,3dqp9h,AA-ZZ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:13:16 2015 UTC,"Type in ""Top NFL WR Corps 2015"" and many sites have Packers and Broncos switching between 1 and 2.   Do the same with Oline and most have them ranked 3rd or 4th.   Lacy is a young and very solid back at RB.   This offense may be more talented than the 2011 franchise record setting offense.   The defense is still a question but they have two solid young safeties and a good CB.   Matthews is versatile. Peppers was a good OLB. The rest of the LB core seem to be role players.  The dline lead by Daniels with Raji back should be a lot better.  A Rodgers-less Packers roster could go head to head with a Stafford-less Lions roster, if not better cause the Packers have a proven back. They would not have to rely on the pass."

I'm not saying that they don't have a good receiving core you are undervaluing Lions and overvaluing the Packers. A QB plays a big roll in that. Without Rodgers they won't be the top offense that is a fact. Lets go over the great Packers line LT David Bakhtiari below average PFF ranked him as the 53 best tackle in the NFL there are only 32 teams LG Josh Sitton he is a All Pro top five guard in the League I love watching him play he has a nastiness to his game. Now the center Corey Linsley had a good rookie season but is a unknown, I want to talk about the Right Guard before then I will get back to the center. T.J. Lang who is a great person and remember him coming out of college. T.J. Lang isn't a great or good guard, but I would say he is between good and above average as a starter. Now good guard play and QB play can make a center look better then he is. I want to wait a couple of season to see what type of player Corey Linsley is. I have seen bad centers look good because of good guard and QB play. Last Bryan Bulaga who is a below average RT, that the packers really didn't want to resign him but have nothing better to put in that spot now, and are actively looking to replace him. I wouldn't call that a great NFL line. It's decent but I would worry about the tackles but lucky the Packers have a good QB that can extent plays and move out of pressure. Lacy I never liked him coming out of College maybe I'm bias to bama RB's. He is better then I though he would be, but with the offense the Packers have he needs to do better he faces a lot of 6 man boxes.(meaning when teams play the Packers they are not worried about the running game, Starks looks better when he is in the game) I loved Haha coming out of Bama I think he is going to be a good to great player but this is his second year and he isn't better then Quinn right now. Lions have better safeties and depth, On CB's no team has that lock down CB and overall the packers have better depth there. Lions have to many young players and unknowns if Slay can keep going the way he is (He did Shut down Dez in the playoff game) he might become a elite CB. The Packers are Moving Matthew inside (side note will Matthew play a whole season?), Peppers is old and this is his second season playing OLB he mostly just plays DE on Rushing downs. Raji now just seems lazy and unmotivated, the Front 7 is very suspect.  Lions still have a good dline even with the lost of Suh, they have a great LBing core, and a good secondary. Well maybe there will be a game this season where the Packers and Lions play without their starting QB so we can see."

detroitlions,3dn23s,thabe331,3,Fri Jul 17 16:34:46 2015 UTC,"A more accurate title  '5 Lions who we hope like hell elevate their play this year'  Sure,  Stafford with 41 TDs and 10 ints would be nice.  That's not a reasonable projection though.  Ziggy, should be 'double digits' sacks?  meh,  going from 8 to 10 sacks won't make a difference.  If he is to be a game changer, i'm thinking more like 14 or more sacks.   We'll definitely need the QB pressure.  Again, not a reasonable projection.  Ebron at 50 catches 500 yards,  a good mark to shoot for.  That would be a nice season for him, and doable.  Waddle, that would be huge for this season, we need him to get back and play well at RT  Tulloch,  he's a stud, great to have him back.  I think Austin did an amazing job adjusting to his absence, but we're much better off with him back.  Just no more celebrations, ok."
detroitlions,3dn23s,NiceSasquatch,3,Fri Jul 17 17:39:45 2015 UTC,"Sure, Stafford with 41 TDs and 10 ints would be nice. That's not a reasonable projection though.   Why wouldn't this be unreasonable? He's expected to take a big step forward. I think 33-35 TD's should be the minimum.  I think Ziggy taking the step to being a double-digit sack player would be a big improvement, especially since some seem to wonder how he'll play without Suh eating up blockers.  The other two I totally agree on"
detroitlions,3dn23s,Balrog77,2,Fri Jul 17 19:17:52 2015 UTC,"I think Stafford taking a big step forward is the least likely to happen and not due to him. For him to perform at a high level, there is so many things that may need to go well:   Ebron steps up Warford returns to form Laken has a Warfordesque rookie season RT is somewhat stabilized Calvin stays healthy"

detroitlions,3djkj6,wiseprogressivethink,26,Thu Jul 16 20:04:31 2015 UTC,"Orlovsky has always seemed like he has a good sense of humor.  The man made a stupid play and people seem to remember that the most but here he is owning up to it and taking it in stride.  If the NFL had cameras on me at my job every Monday morning, I'd be laughed out of my job.  Also, who knew Orlovsky would have more staying power than Ol' Joey Blueskies???"
detroitlions,3djkj6,urbaneyezcom,8,Thu Jul 16 20:44:57 2015 UTC,"He may not be that good, but he seems like an awesome guy."
detroitlions,3djkj6,k5berry,7,Thu Jul 16 22:15:50 2015 UTC,"The Oregon fan in me loved every minute of watching Joey play in Green and Yellow, and likes to point out that he was still the best QB in that draft class.  The Lion fan in me hates everything about 2002's draft class."
detroitlions,3djkj6,FearMeIAmRoot,7,Thu Jul 16 21:23:40 2015 UTC,"Not so fast I would Say David Garrard had a much better career than Joey. He was drafted in the 4th round by the Jags. Also Carr and Joey are basically a toss up, they both got screwed by the teams that drafted them and they never developed turning into okay backups"
detroitlions,3djkj6,Evander_Berry_Wall,4,Thu Jul 16 21:28:48 2015 UTC,"Meh... Gerrard was one of the better players on a bad team.  He also sat on the bench for four years before getting meaningful minutes.   I wouldn't argue he had a better career, he just started more games for the same mediocre organization.  Had Joey or Carr gone to JAX, it would have been the same story for either of them.  Instead, they floated around the league as competent backups on decent teams instead of staying with the same bad ones that drafted them."
detroitlions,3djkj6,FearMeIAmRoot,4,Thu Jul 16 21:45:03 2015 UTC,"Actually if I'm being honest the team carried him more than he carried his team, pretty much the opposite of him being one of the better players on a bad team.  However, while he wasn't stellar by any means, he was a pretty solid QB on a run-first-and-play-defense team.  Kind of in the same vein as Brad Johnson.  Doesn't really change the fact that that was a bad, bad year for quarterbacks.  Still, Garrard is the best of that bunch, the only one that made a Pro Bowl and who finished his career with a winning record (albeit barely).  And I'd say Shaun Hill was the second-best QB in that class (though he didn't get drafted)."
detroitlions,3djkj6,RyanFuller003,2,Thu Jul 16 22:11:42 2015 UTC,It's also funny to think that Cutler was the best qb of his draft.
detroitlions,3djkj6,thabe331,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:53:04 2015 UTC,"He's not bad.  He's had some good seasons and some bad, but good enough to be a starter for ten years."
