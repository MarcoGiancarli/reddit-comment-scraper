I don't know how common it is for children that age to get them, but I used to get them when I was maybe 6 or 7. I've had glasses since I was 3, so I'm not sure if it had anything to do with needing a new prescription or anything.   Is she hydrated, rested, and well-fed when these instances occur? I'm more likely to get a migraine with aura if I'm dehydrated or have waited too long to eat. Or if I've spent too much time in the sun."
Parenting,3e2ov2,RedInkRiot,8,Tue Jul 21 14:32:19 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, when the optometrist checked her vision it was pretty bad without glasses (she could barely read the third row).

But otherwise yes, I think she was hydrated, rested, and well-fed (the last episode happened when she was playing after dinner)."

I had a period of a couple months where I'd get migraines a couple times a week because I was at the computer so often and needed reading glasses.  A dark room and an ice pack on her head can do amazing things if she'll let you subject her to it at that age! :)"

Parenting,3e2ov2,RedInkRiot,7,Tue Jul 21 14:44:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I've had migraines with aura my whole life. Dehydration, sun over exposure, and going too long without eating are all factors to consider. I wouldn't wish that pain on anyone. Growing up, it was hard for my father to understand just how severe the pain was. If you can imagine, it's like a brain freeze headache that lasts for 6+ hours, and then only fades to last another 10 hours as a dull throb. Feels like, if only you could spoon out your eyeballs, you'd relieve some pressure."

Parenting,3e2ov2,AnnaLemma,9,Tue Jul 21 16:54:35 2015 UTC,"The other thing about migraine with aura is that often you get the aura first and then the headache, and pain meds work best if you take them right when you first get the aura instead of waiting for the pain. So talk to a doctor about the best pain reliever to use and then ask her to let you know when she first gets the aura so you can dose her. It should help."

We give him ibuprofen, a cold cloth for his head and let him sleep in a dark quiet room. I have given him caffeine with the ibuprofen before and that seems to help more.  There say they are more common in children with mother's who also have migraines, so i guess it's my fault :/ Sometimes for myself breathing into a bag, or even the neck of my own shirt helps, the CO2 seems to do something with the nerves in your head."

Parenting,3e3pth,therealrenshai,4,Tue Jul 21 20:00:15 2015 UTC,"First of all well done for stepping up to the plate and helping to look after your little sister.  Am sure it can't be easy!  The most important thing is that whoever is potty training her needs to be ready to follow through with a consistent routine  and keep it up for however long it takes.  This is the biggest key to success.  Different people all doing different things will confuse the heck out of her.  At 4 she is old enough to engage and make choices so get her excited about it.  Have a look on Amazon for a potty training book for girls - maybe let her look with you and choose one together.  Make a big thing of it when it arrives and read it with her several times before you start again.  Maybe take her along to buy a new potty or a step and toilet seat insert or have her look at ones online.  Have a look on Amazon for potty training books for yourself, there are some great books that help explain how to do this and pick one that most closely reflects your views and routine.  Don't start to potty train again until this is all set up and make sure she is aware ahead of time when the ""big day"" is about to start.  It all about encouraging her, explaining over and over and rewarding her when she gets it right.  Never about punishing her if she has an accident - and she will.  Plan to spend at least the first week either at home or someone else's home close to all the stuff you need.  No long car journeys or shopping at the mall.  She needs to be somewhere familiar and know exactly where the potty/toilet is at all times.  Keep gently reminding her to think if she needs a wee, not every 5 minutes, but at regular, sensible intervals.  When she wakes up, a while after she has eaten/had a drink, before bed and to begin with a few times in between.  Pee proof furniture and bedding.  There are mattress covers and pads/mats that you can buy and really help to reduce clean up and stress.  Also sleeping through the night is very different from day time.  Treat day time first.  Good luck."

Basically so long as there was something on the crotch, it was like having a diaper in his mind.  Accidents still happened, but it helped immensely.  Not 100% sure why, but it did.   I've heard of folks basically sitting the potty chair in front of the TV and saying ""drink this, don't get up until you pee"".  I don't know that I agree with that one, but it worked for someone else."

Unemotional (difficult because of how frustrating/gross it can be), ""Oops, you had an accident. Let's go get changed"". And then take as long as possible to change them (shower if they pooped) so that they miss out on fun playtime. Remind them to use the potty. Maybe try watching the potty episode of Daniel Tiger and sing the song and all. I believe it's called Prince Wednesday Goes Potty or something. Just remember to be consistent! There is also an Elmo potty song! Both can be found on YouTube."

It's a ""thing"" that you're not a good mom if you're not constantly driving your kid to activities. But kids, particularly that age,  need a lot of unstructured time. Figuring out how to occupy yourself constructively is an important life skill. Also, having lots of activities can infringe on healthy meals, depending on the rest of your schedule.   Maybe tell your daughter you'll take a month off of activities to adjust to school. Then at the two week mark, ask her what she wants to do. She may even learn of different opportunities from school or new classmates, so at that point you both will know how much extra she can handle and what all your options are."

Parenting,3e2xqw,dmf95742,7,Tue Jul 21 15:45:16 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, at 5, sports should be about having fun and working as a team. The intimidation that the coaches use would be understandable for middle school or high school sports... or maybe really competitive upper-elementary grades... but I definitely think you should pull your daughter out of those classes. Is she swimming competitively, or just learning the basics of swimming? What other options exist in your area? If you're in MN or IL, look into Foss Swim School... it's a great program where kids really learn to love swimming! At 5, I think a 30 minute class is much more appropriate- an hour is a really long time to be in a very, very structured, physically active setting. (Yes, I know school is starting... school also tends to be a bit less structured in the sense that teachers plan short activities with some play time/break time/coloring time in between.)  For what it's worth, I was a competitive swimmer for 6 years in middle school and high school, and while my coaches were tough- they weren't loud and in-your-face. I don't think the situation you're describing sounds appropriate for a 5 year old. Do you have a YMCA nearby?"
Parenting,3e2xqw,SteveHarveysSuit,5,Tue Jul 21 16:38:08 2015 UTC,"As for the coaching I think I get the booming voice thing and would have no problem with it.  I've been in the indoor pool area where my kids take lessons and when there is a lot of people there swimming and splashing around it is hard to hear.  And when kids are half submerged in water it is even harder to hear.  Plus at a pool you don't want kids messing around.  The risk of injury is too great.  As for the scheduling.  I would say 1 hour twice a week is probably too much when starting Kindergarten.  I would either cut it out completely until she adjusts, or at least scale it back some.  We started extra currriculars in November when my son start Kindergarten.  It was basketball and they met one night a week and Saturdays.  I am glad we didn't do an activity in September and October he really needed the down time and we need the time to get used to a new routine."

I'm from Ontario, so our winters are hell, and wet hair really isn't that big of a deal tbh, unless you are walking instead of driving.

It is much more rigorous and I was told that we should be expected to come home with quite a bit of homework.  SO, with all that. I'm planning nothing until I see how we all handle Kindergarten (lol, that sounds nuts). Once we all have a good grasp on the situation, I'll add in one sport or activity a season.   It just sounds like an awful lot, IMO: school, homework, school activities and projects in addition to homework, swim, Daisy, dance.   I just don't like to be kept so busy I don't have down time.  Also, my kids have been in swim lessons for years. We've never had any coaches like you describe and my kids (including the 2 year old) are excellent swimmers. They speak to my child kindly, as one would expect a teacher would. However if you're comfortable with it, not my place to tell you you're wrong.

Parenting,3e2xqw,IveCreatedAMuenster,2,Tue Jul 21 18:35:59 2015 UTC,"I'd like to comment based on my personal experience, not as a parent. It sounds like the swim program your daughter is in is one that preps for competitive swim team: the goal is not ""fun"" and ""water safety"" experience, it is to identify talent and those interested in pursuing high-level athletics. (This happens in many types of athletics- gymnastics and ballet come to mind as well.) I started ""pre"" swim team at age 5, swim team at age 6, with a very competitive team, with a coach who had a similar style to the one you describe. I had talent, and liked pushing myself hard. By age 8 I was doing morning practices and became a state champion. I continued to swim in college, and was all-american. However, my sisters also tried swim team, didn't like it, and quit. Although being a swimmer taught me many great skills (dedication, discipline, how to deal with extreme pain, overcoming disappointment), if I were to do it again I would never impose such a high level of structure and commitment on such a young child.  It sounds like you are interested in sticking with swim team because it helps your daughter learn to swim and coping skills. (1) There are many other ways to learn to swim that are not via a rigorous swim-team program: ones that focus on water play, fun, and safety skills. (2) There are many other opportunities to learn coping skills as well (I assume you mean emotional coping skills- like dedication?)."
Parenting,3e2xqw,avoidhugeships,2,Tue Jul 21 19:01:46 2015 UTC,"It does sound like a lot, to me.  I feel like swim classes over the summer is perfectly legit.  That is how I always did it because I only had access to an outdoor pool ... I took strict swim lessons every summer and focused on school and a couple other lessons over the school year.  Every summer I went back to swim (not by my own choice, my parents really wanted us to swim well), every year I progressed into the next ""level"" of swimming until junior lifeguard and then swimming was just a fun summer thing for me.  If anything, I think having it be a summer activity made it a little more special and fun.  So, my point is just that I think if you are worried about overscheduling, follow your gut.  Your daughter can resume swim next summer and will almost certainly continue to progress and learn and remain a strong swimmer."

I try and have my elementary school kids in the house by 6pm for dinner, baths, bedtime etc.  After school activities are done between 4 and 6 pm.    1 hour swim lessons are tough.  30 minutes with the proper student/instructor ratio is fine for a kid that age.  Not only is it physically exhausting but kids cannot focus on much of anything for an hour. Even in the classroom things will be broken down into much smaller segments.    Unless your kid is training for competitive swimming, the whole scenario sounds unnecessary.  Hard coaching is fine with me when it comes to actual training.  A kindergarten aged kid doesn't need a drill instructor.  If you're just trying to get the kid swim safely and comfortably for recreation, your situation now may be overkill."

The swim instructor could have gotten near her so she could hear and asked her to join in with what the class was doing. If she didn't want to then could have deferred to you, or used other peaceful approaches to gain the child interest.   In class a teacher shouldn't use intimidation. If you teach your child to listen to intimidating people, or blindly follow authority figures when she really doesn't want to, you'll be leading her to believe she must, and she may one day find herself in a very bad situation with an authority figure and not trust her gut."

Parenting,3e3s65,davidrb84,2,Tue Jul 21 21:12:01 2015 UTC,"This is my question, too. Pediatrician said not to be worried until my son is two and even then it's probably not a big deal.  But his receptive language is great (identifies numbers, letters, colours, shapes, and knows the names of most things around the house) and doesn't have any autism-spectrum signs in the social end of things. Doc said it's just his way of learning.  He'll be 2 in September and doesn't use many words aside from ""no"", ""mom"", ""dad"", "" cat"", and ""hug"". He's started saying ""thank you"" now and then but with a bit of an impediment (""unk you"").  But the doc said not to worry and not to call it a delay, so I'm sticking to that. Said boys are often slower to talk. So I'm listening to that."
Parenting,3e2kny,smokeywurg,11,Tue Jul 21 13:51:00 2015 UTC,"Normal. Changing caregivers is very hard on a child. She will need to bond with the new teachers, then things will calm down. You should give 1-2 months in a new situation before beginning to suspect anything.   Though, if parents are ever anything but the most confident in their child care, I encourage them to drop in for unexpected visits or early pickups! I am a home daycare provider and I always encourage new parents to do this a couple times in the beginning (they never take me up on it though, because the fact that I am so open makes them very confident in the quality of care their child is receiving)."

Seriously, every daycare provider I've ever talked to about this (so maybe four total) have also said it is generally not good to drop in halfway through the day, because it will mess with the kids' routines and make your child think she's going home with you. I know the provider above had a different opinion, but I tried this once with my kid and it was bad news for the next several weeks. The separation anxiety just exacerbates itself because she no longer has a set routine where she knows exactly when she will see you.  Obviously in the end it's up to you, but I would highly, HIGHLY recommend against this."

However, we get reports that he is cheerful and helpful during the day, and he tells us that he likes his teachers and plays with his best friends during the day (it is SO NICE once they are old enough to express themselves with words). I think this is normal but stressful and, sorry to say, aging up into the next room may cause more tears. Best of luck."

Lasted about a month. Then he was just back to normal, which is common at that age apparently. We found he did much better when we let him walk in on his own instead of carry him in. We had to factor in some extra time at drop off, but instead of clinging/crying, he dropped our hands to go play as soon as we got to his room. Good luck, I'm sure it will pass!"

We didn't really get to start till we were about 3.5yrs.  What we found worked well, once our son was ready, was to go pantless around the house.  For some reason, with everything blowing in the wind, he was more aware of when he had to go.  There will be accidents.  If your son is like mine, there may be the occasion where he pee's IN mom's purse.  Or in the hall right outside the bathroom door, just because.

Parenting,3e2tub,RedInkRiot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:18:50 2015 UTC,"IMO, I think kids learn best when the parent makes a furtive effort to potty train instead of casually offering the potty every once in a while. I've seen a lot of kids that start to learn early (yay!) and then continue in that half-way potty trained state longer than most (no!!).   So, my method of potty training was to remind them every 30-45 minutes. In the beginning, I gave them extra water and juice to make them pee more so they could get the habit down. Then, when you feel they are better at letting you know, you can remind less or not insist on trying when they say they don't need to go.  And, if they weren't catching on at all within a couple days, I would back off the training and try again in a few months.   I first tried training each of my boys when they first turned 2. I backed off and tried again once or twice with both of them. They were both fully trained by 2 1/2 without problem."

Beyond that, I'd rather her have an accident and start learning to tell me. It's my opinion that if you ask them to try constantly you have an annoyed child and one who is actually not potty trained. A potty trained child tells you when they need to go. I also cannot recommend the Daniel Tiger potty training episode enough.  Mine decided to potty train herself at 2.5 based on said episode. It took 2 days (one really bad one). She night trained at 3.  Her first time on the potty was at 15 months. Just cause she was curious. After that she went (or didn't go) based on her own amusement until 3."

Chances are this lady complains about everything, and they are 10 times more sick of her shit than you are.

If you owned a coop/condo you'd likely be responsible for carpeting 80% of your apartment. It's my opinion that she's harassing you at this point. I'd set up an email rule against her email to repeat this message and just ignore them at this point. Sure, it's passive aggressive... but that's the point.  She's free to rent a penthouse apartment if she doesn't want anyone above her. Should you not vacuum? Move furniture? Bowl? (ok you probably shouldn't bowl unless she gets really annoying :) )"

My husband and I don't have children yet. At a previous apartment we had a neighbor we didn't know thank us for not complaining their baby cried. Really? Who was complaining babies cry? That's what they do.  In the past my husband has had a downstairs neighbor woman complain that they walked around their own apartment (housemates, before we were living together) and that their cat walked around. Apparently the cat walking around at night was super loud . . . somehow. But the place allowed pets and cats are often awake at night.   Now we rent downstairs apartments. This way no one will be upset that we choose to walk in our home. And we never complain that our upstairs neighbors actually live in their homes because that's pretty unreasonable.

I have never lived in an apartment, but I have worked third shift for years and have a family, sometimes I find myself hyper-aware of even minor creaking and everyday household noises. So, coming from someone who is sensitive to sounds, I think perhaps your neighbor may be going through a stage of ""looking for noise"" or in other words developed a heightened awareness of sounds above her and has associated negative feelings about it. She hears a light thump and then actively waits for any other sounds, if it becomes quiet, her mind may be waiting for more noise instead of going about life again.   You could invite her over for coffee and make things more personable again, this might be a good way of reminding her that the sounds are coming from human beings, a family, a child.  She may not understand or remember what it's like to be a parent, seeing your family in action may help empathy resurface. Best wishes."

Inviting her for a coffee will only give her a chance to spy with her little eye around in your place and then she will be telling you about what toys you should get rid of, as they are so noisy.  What I would do is this — one of the weekends have your baby stay with relatives and just do stuff around the house you normally would — vaccuum, mover some furniture, play some music, have a little dance.  After if she complains, email her that at this point she is interfering with your enjoyment of peaceful living and ask her to stop harassing you.  Because all you're doing is living.  By addressing her complaints over and over again, you're inviting her to complain more, as she had an audience.

Look at how your child interacts with each and what value they take away on an individual basis.

We didn't have that problem at all. The people we know are mostly just glad for you if your kid goes to college, and they understand the value of getting through school without debt if at all possible.   Also, our older daughter went to a small state school in a different region of the country where she got in state tuition because of a generous academic scholarship.

What you say reflects on how much money you are willing to spend on their education, how good a candidate they are, and later they'll see if the kid didn't get into the competitive school you mentioned and go to a less competitive one and, without having to say a thing, they can assume he was rejected.  All that stuff that would be incredibly rude to ask directly.  It's something that people work for intensely in high school, it's the biggest and most obvious sorting mechanism we have in our society.

Parenting,3e1b8e,bloodygonzo,7,Tue Jul 21 05:21:48 2015 UTC,"I work in public health. There are a number of reasons it is recommended to receive hep B at birth.   First, it can provide some protection if the mother is hep B positive. Hep B can be contracted in a number of settings/situations, including medical settings. Women can be exposed to hep B during the many medical contacts they have during pregnancy. A simple lapse in basic infection control practices during a routine blood draw or anything else can cause a woman to contract hep b and ultimately pass it on to her baby. A woman would likely never know she was infected. Lapses in infection control practices happen more often than people realize.   Second, the baby is exposed to a number of medical procedures immediately after birth, and some of those procedures can happen unexpectedly (like my daughter's unexpected NICU stay). Read issuing for any number of reasons is not uncommon. Such procedures/readmissions increase the risk of contracting hep B. Giving the vaccine provides some protection immediately to reduce the risk of transmission during routine and unexpected medical procedures.   Third, hep B is a series vaccines. Because daycare and other places where children congregate are other points for possible transmission, the idea is to have the full series administered by the time the child is really interacting with other children, thus maximizing protection.   Fourth, the hep B virus is really resilient. It can survive for hours outside of the body which is why it's relatively easy to transmit (compared to HIV). Basically, it's easy to contract it, especially in medical settings.   Finally, hep B is a serious illness. Children have died from it and treatment can include the need for liver transplantation, among other things. It's often a lifelong chronic condition that is very costly to treat. The vaccine is cheap, effective, and very safe.   The vaccine recommendations that come out of the CDC are there for a reason. No one wants to give a newborn a vaccine if it's not necessary, but the evidence is clear that the benefits of administering the vaccine immediately after birth far outweigh any minute risks.   Tl;dr: get the vaccine. It's recommended for a reason."

I felt uncomfortable with my tiny baby getting shots right off the bat (plus I breast fed so my antibodies were being passed part of why we get the whooping cough shot  while pregnant) but starting at 3 months I began shots. It's different because I SAH with baby but if there had been day care involved I would have stayed shots pronto. Instead we did them slower and at 2 we are all caught up."

I did do quite a bit of research though - there is quite a bit to read, honestly you can ho a long way with just google.  My personal conclusion was that the birth dose is probably safe but also probably uneffective and unimportant in a new born whoes mother is not hepB positive. I went ahead and had my son get it before we left the hospital but not during his first day of life, and will probably do the same for his sister. The important thing is that your child get the other regularly scheduled doses, if your wife is on board for those then I don't think you have a problem.  Do some research of your own. It will probably help you to either be ok with your wife's position or give you the info to convince her that the vaccine is safe.  Edit to mention, our pediatrician did not care if we skiped the birth dose or not."

Just imagine how horrible you would feel if your baby got sick because a shot was refused.

Parenting,3e1b8e,KidsDogsLifeRepeat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:28 2015 UTC,"I believe OPs question is spicifically about the birth dose, not saying the baby wont get his normal hepB series. The birth dose itself is an excelent treatment for hepB exposure, but does little to provide any sort of long term immunity (hence why there is a later scheduled series during the infants first months).  Also hepB risk is related more with life style than location since it is transmitted by body fluids (think HIV).  If your friend is old enough to have grand children the vaccine was not an option for his childhood, but rather something his doctor should have discussed with him as an adult if he had a high risk lifestyle."
Parenting,3e1b8e,217justtoday,0,Tue Jul 21 18:22:50 2015 UTC,"There are two reason why it is offered at birth:   if the mother has HepB, giving the vaccine at birth can prevent infection in the newborn it's convenient and giving it at birth ensures that most babies get it   I declined HepB at the hospital for my first, and the birth center didn't even offer it for my 2nd child. I do not have HepB, neither does my husband and neither one of us are at high risk for contracting it.  Both of my kids received their HepB vaccines at 2 and 4 months as part of their regular shots (it's part of a combo shot).  Obviously I don't think it's a big deal."

A few things that may help:   Have a clear visitation schedule.  It can be as little as the first Monday of every month, or as much as every Tuesday and Thursday evening.  It's up to you - however much you can stand.  Your mother's anxiety will be lessened by knowing there's a predictable schedule. Don't tolerate manipulative behaviour.  As SOON as she starts up with the ""Do you miss me?"" routine, remind her that the question has already been asked and answered.  Distract her, if necessary.  Suggest an activity she can do with the child. If she sulks, ignore her and carry on with your day around her, same as you'd do with a sulky child.  (If grandma's going to behave like a child, then she's going to be treated like a child!) If she behaves especially badly (ie, yelling, berating, upsetting the children), calmly ask her to leave.  If she refuses to leave your home, gather up your boys and take them to the park without her.  I guarantee you, she'll be gone by the time you get back.  (I had to do this once... and fortunately, ONLY once!) Be honest and open with your children.  If by some chance she does tell your child, ""No one likes me!"", ask him, ""Do you think that's true?  Why would grandma say a thing like that?  What's grandma trying to get from us/make us do?""  Even small kids can understand when people are acting badly out of feelings of insecurity and anxiety.  If you're truthful with the kids, they won't feel that they have to make sure Grandma ""feels"" loved.  In fact, they'll learn that even adults can be imperfect, but that doesn't mean they aren't still part of our family, and - additionally! - it doesn't mean we can't still love them (even if they're black holes of neediness whose desires can never be fulfilled).   My mother goes through periodic bouts of behaviour similar to what you're describing.  She has her good months and her bad months.  As a result, we've had many long chats with the kids about how to handle Grandma when she's in a bad place.  I think it's been good for them, in the long run.  They've learned compassion and tolerance and forgiveness.  And they've learned how to manage difficult people.  Oh, and one final tip:  Keep a sense of humour!  One visit, my mom and my teenage daughter were bickering.  My mom had been unsuccessfully trying to bully my kid into making a particular life decision, which we'd already told the kid was hers and hers alone to make.  As my girl headed out the door, she said, ""I love you!""  My mother backed away from her offered hug, crossed her arms, and replied sourly, ""Sometimes I wonder if you do.""  Which inspired a bright sunny smile from my girl and, ""Love you, Grandma!  I'll see you next week.""  By the time my daughter got home she was giggling, ""Omigawd, mom!  Grandma was trying to manipulate me, and she's SO bad at it!""  Having a sense of humour about the whole thing will carry you and your family a long, long way."

It's just ten minutes of effort, but it pays off hugely, in the happy-grandma department.  It also means you won't feel as guilty whenever you do have to draw a firm line with her.  Good luck!"

Parenting,3dy0co,Jaberkaty,11,Mon Jul 20 14:23:17 2015 UTC,"Blocking her on Facebook might help.  Resentment's one of those funny emotions that's more about what you feel you want and need and aren't getting, than it is about what the other person's doing.  Your mum is who she is.  She isn't going to change.  You are who you are, and you aren't going to change, either.  The best thing to do, for both your mum and you, is to stop letting her live in your head so much.  It doesn't matter what she tells her friends.  It doesn't matter whether she's lying, or even if she's truly convinced herself she's telling the truth.  Her feelings aren't your responsibility.  What matters is raising two happy, successful little boys, maintaining a solid, loving relationship with your husband, and accomplishing your personal life goals (whatever they are).  Your mother can be part of that, but only on your terms.  You shouldn't be looking to her for emotional support, or ""mothering"".  And whatever she gets up to outside your immediate family circle is nothing you need to concern yourself with.  Example:  Last month, my mom was upset at me over a disagreement that had happened a week earlier.  She brought it up and my response was to laugh and say, ""Are you still holding a grudge over that?""  She said, irritably, ""Yes!"" but then she dropped the topic and hasn't brought it up again.  Nor will she.  It takes two to fight and I refuse to engage."

I don't know if I'm the popular opinion here, but I do feel like a relationship with the grandparents is worth a little relaxing of the guidelines. However, there are definitely certain criterion that aren't flexible.  Personally, my husband and my parents run the gamut. My mom is the most respectful of our wishes and I have the least reservations with her. My in-laws are responsible caretakers, but they spoil the heck out of our kids and I get frustrated with how bratty my kids can be after a night with them. I let it go because I'd rather the kids know their grandparents than not know them.  My dad is not a responsible enough adult to watch my kids alone. I'm just not comfortable with it on many levels. Instead, I make a point to spend time with him pretty often so he can see the kids regularly. It would break his heart if he didn't get to see them, but I just can't let it happen without me there."

Yes, they spoil a bit more because they have a bit more money and don't see us as often. Mom always mentions offhandedly about how things are getting tight around the house but then overspends on the boys.   The eldest has been going to bed around 7-8 pm but she'd let him stay up until midnight or later watching trashy tv mostly because she just wanted someone to cuddle with while she babysits. So my husband and I would get home to everyone still awake and cranky as hell the next morning. Thanks a lot mom.   I know there's to be a bit of spoiling from grandparents but if I give her just one request, like the ice cream, that's the day she'll say ""Oh, well he just had to have some!"" Well mom, you weren't the one up with him until 3 am while he was vomiting and pooping everywhere.  I guess the thing is I really just don't trust her to be an adult to the kids.   She also threatened to sell my eldest when he was misbehaving while she was babysitting.

She's loving and I want my kids to have a good relationship with her, but she requires lots of validation and acts like having some space means we don't love her or something.  I can see her projecting her issues onto my kids subtly and it caused concern.  We had issues with boundaries too.  My mom is not a very attentive driver so she asked to take the kids out and I explained my concerns with her driving and asked that she stay close by.  She agreed and didn't fight us or anything...but when the time came she decided to go to the mall 20 miles away which means driving on the freeway seemingly without regard of the talk we just had about her staying close by.   We moved about 1,000 miles away a few months ago and the distance has been good for us.  I love my mom but it is un-healthy and your family and kids are priority now.  I don't know how I would handle this if I had stayed there...but you do have a right to be concerned you're not over thinking it.  Respecting your role as a parent is a big deal, and I get that grand parents get to have little cheats about small things but there are clear boundaries you should draw and be clear about how important those are.

It's very hard to say, based on a short internet post, whether or not the OP's mom is narcissistic, but it sure sounds possible.  For me, coming to terms with my own mother's narcissism was helped by a few key books:   Why Is It Always About You? Trapped in the Mirror: Adult Children of Narcissists in their Struggle for Self    Just reading through these and seeing the examples – and finally finding words for the feeling that some things just weren't right with what my mom demanded of me was extremely powerful.  I will say that it has also challenged me to see the dangerous bits of the narcissistic pattern in my behaviors – I've come a long way, but it's definitely a constant point for growth in myself as well...   edit: /u/martyrmom – I've read a few more of your replies and some of the things you say are compelling bits of evidence suggesting pathological narcissism...

Parenting,3dy0co,PurpleMinionDay,3,Mon Jul 20 19:57:44 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm going through the exact thing with my mother in law. Sunday nearly started WWIII. she likes to do 15 different things at once, but ultimately doesn't do them well because she's doing too much. She's also extremely klutzy- had had multiple broken bones and surgeries in less than a year.   My husband told get nicely many times that she can't run around and do everything with our daughter (8 mos) because it's not safe. Lo and behold we hear our daughter crying and his mom holding her while found 3 different things. He told her forcefully she can't, and now he is evil and ""broke his mother's heart. ""  I don't give a damn if her feelings being hurt means my daughter is safe. He has talked to her numerous times and she refused to listen. Now, she will understand how serious he was.   I don't think you are being too harsh. If the safety of your children could be compromised, you are well within your rights."
Parenting,3dy0co,PurpleMinionDay,5,Mon Jul 20 19:47:31 2015 UTC,"She needs some damn therapy. I don't know if that's something you could suggest or not. Saying no one likes her is probably just low self-esteem.  I would tell her that she can't see them until she gets professional help. She's emotionally manipulative and not a healthy influence. That sounds harsh though, doesn't it? Maybe it is. I don't know. Bear with me.  You're doing a really good job keeping the visitation limited. I'd cut it off until she was getting help.  Here's why (and you may think I'm overreacting, I may be, so I have a short story):  I grew up with a dad with horrible self-esteem. Sounds like you did too, so maybe you can relate to this. He was a single parent (by the way, I know this differs very drastically from your scenario, I'm just explaining why ""therapy or GTFO is my response). I felt like I was taking care of him. Oh, and I was so happy to do this as well, by the way. I needed dad, dad needed me. Yay co-dependence, right? No. That's not healthy.   It has made me into the ""people pleaser"" type of person. I mean, it did. I had to get therapy to learn to manage him. He wasn't manipulative, by the way. He was just very obviously sad and after mom left, we were the only thing that made him smile. We knew that. He never tried to guilt us into anything. But we picked up on it. I felt guilty the day I moved out of the house.   Guilt has been a common feeling in my life. The worst, most prominent one. I'm still working on that. It is hard being a mom with a guilt problem. I'm getting way better.   He never tried to MAKE me feel guilty. He never whined, he didn't complain, was always happy for me. But you could tell he was sad. That was all. I was a compassionate kid. I worried about him. I still do.   This is what I'm trying to say- You are correct in thinking that this could impact your kids long-term. I know they aren't too close to her thanks to you intervening, which is GREAT!   I am still dealing with issues from feeling responsible for an ADULT'S feelings as a child and teenager.  Tell them that it's wrong, the way she acts.  We have a grandpa (not my dad, my dad is a WAY better grandpa than dad) that tries to guilt trip our 8 year old. He doesn't see her often, but still. She's old enough that we explained to her that this is not appropriate adult-child interaction and that she is NOT responsible for the way FIL feels. She laughs now, and recognizes, when he tries to pull that shit. She knows. She's still compassionate, but she's also aware that she's responsible, at this point, for ONE person. Her.   Sorry if that was rambling. I had a hard time organizing all those thoughts. Don't let them grow up thinking this is normal. If they still see her, and she does that shit, tell them in terms that they can understand, that it's not right that grandma does that."

You haven't been really specific, so my first impulse is:   She raised at least one kid to full adulthood and probably productivity, so she considers herself knowledgeable on childcare. Your coaching may be unhelpful or condescending to her, even with your most careful approach. She enjoys being loved by the kids, and interacts when them like kids (or maybe babies), which is overly-expressive by adult standards. She seems to actually love your kids and be willing to spend time with them. I'm willing to bet half of the posts on the front page at this moment were written by people who would kill for that sort of extended family.   Again, I don't know the specifics either in your guidelines or her flaunting of them, but I think a little bit of live and let live on this stuff might be best for everyone."

We have a lot of helicopter issues like that. I think she keeps scorecards in her head about how much time the other grandparents spend (even if it's not true), what the other grandparents are allowed to buy (even if it's not true), how much we give her boundaries that we don't give them (even if it's not true), etc.  I think the biggest issue in general are grandparents that don't have hobbies/work.

I have also encountered similar issues related to socializing with kids rather than with adults because they want to rely on/make your child their friend instead of working to make other adults their friend. I'm not saying that grandparents can't be friends with their grandchildren. In terms of discipline and limits, I'd rather encounter a grandparent who's a bestie than a mom or dad who's a bestie.

Lighten up, and let grandma have some time with them. It takes a village, and your way is not the only way they should be exposed to in social development.  Did your mom cause you problems when you were a child?  Was there some lack of success with how she raised you? Grandparents are supposed to spoil the kids, after all. Is there some other below-the-surface reasoning you aren't putting forth for all this?  Are you worried about your boys 'protecting her' from you because you want them to feel that way towards you, instead?  At the risk of the downvotes, I'd argue that you are being unreasonable to your own mom based on the lack of specificity provided, just vague allegations without the underlying facts and opinions and prejudgements included.  It's also ok to let your mom spend money on your kids.   We have one life to live, and the people around us that fill it with joy are the ones that need to be kept in it.  If, for your kids, that's grandma, then you should put aside your own frustration and let her be part of their lives, even if you think it affects your attempts to structure your children's social development the way you want it to happen.  Stop worrying about the unimportant bits, just make sure your children feel loved, feel safe, and educate them."
Parenting,3dy0co,Jalapeno_Business,10,Mon Jul 20 16:51:55 2015 UTC,"It might sound reasonable from your armchair perusal but the ""did you miss me? Did you miss me? Did you miss me?"" combined with the forcing of affection by hugging the kids and not letting go when they want to be let go is alarming. Mostly it's alarming to me because [a family member] used to do the same thing with my daughter and my daughter hated it. I have had to tell her in  a firm voice, ""please let go of the child. She is clearly finished hugging you and now you are forcing your body into contact with her and that is not okay."" It was only at that point that she released my daughter, with a shocked ""I would NEVER do that!!!"" despite an actual physical struggle that took place in front of me between my child who wanted to move out of the hug and my [family member] using her adult strength to hold her in place. She has never been alone for an extended period of time with my child, and she never will be.   There are myriad reasons beyond that incident that these family members are no longer a part of our lives (that have far more to do with the fact that their behavior has been mentally/emotionally detrimental to me in their treatment toward me, my SO and my other loved ones - I can't be a good mom to my child with that type of daily behavior present in my life) but maybe I'm squarely on OP's side because her recounts of what she's experiencing with her mom was the beginning of what ultimately came down to protecting my family from incredibly damaging emotional abuse disguised as ""love"" for our family, ultimately resulting in a motion for a restraining order and no contact.   TL;DR - I have personally experienced what OP is describing and, unfortunately in my anecdotal experience, it has escalated to complete removal of the offenders from my life.

Downvotes be damned, but it's ok, I did start out wtih 'armchair' as a warning that it might be made up bullshit anyway.  These threads bring out all the bullshit talkers, and I felt like joining in on a different tact from most of those showing up to circlejerk the issue. ;)"
Parenting,3dy0co,dezmd,2,Mon Jul 20 17:46:48 2015 UTC,"Reading the responses to this post are blowing my mind.  People are suggesting therapy and cutting off contact from one vague post.  The specific examples like spending too much on a birthday or letting the kid eat ice cream are just par for the course with pretty much any grandparent.  The fact they are even being brought up in the first place makes me agree with your ""armchair assessment""."
Parenting,3dzsb4,mommynerd,13,Mon Jul 20 21:20:39 2015 UTC,"It could be anything so definitely call the pediatrician and get a referral to a pediatric neurologist for a full evaluation. Things like autism and spd vary so much and often other issues can mimic the symptoms of both so it's best to get everything laid out and go from there.   Everyone at some point shows symptoms of SPD and even though he has a lot of the traits it could be secondary to something else . I have a child with SPD and even though I could check off half the list with things that described him it took 2 years to get the diagnosis because they had to rule everything imaginable out first.   It does get better though, once the cause is figured out the workarounds are usually easy enough. Mine used to hold his ears at school assemblies so he kept a pair of noise cancelling headphones in his backpack and he used to not be able to stand dirty hands so I bought wet wipes in travel packs for him to wipe his hands as needed.   The biggest thing was watching for signs and diverting him before the meltdowns happened. It has gotten much, much better with age."
Parenting,3dzsb4,ajwebb23,6,Mon Jul 20 22:36:49 2015 UTC,For us it was the opposite. He got the SPD diagnosis almost right away at around age 2 but it took us six more years to get the Autism diagnosis. :-/
Parenting,3dzsb4,LadyGrizabella,3,Mon Jul 20 23:36:08 2015 UTC,All of the specialist we've seen over the years always told me that SPD wasn't common as a stand alone issue and almost always comes paired with something else so from the beginning they said he had SPD but kept delaying the official diagnosis of only SPD because they were trying to find what it was paired with.  Thankfully though my sons case is very mild and the teachers at school were willing to help with the little things without an IEP saying they had to so the official  diagnosis didn't change much other than getting the IEP just in case future teachers aren't so nice.
Parenting,3dzsb4,ajwebb23,2,Tue Jul 21 00:11:42 2015 UTC,"For us, the diagnosis of SPD, apraxia and dyspraxia due to hypotonia were first. We KNEW something else was up, we just didn't know what it was. I highly suspected a spectrum disorder but we were told no, it couldn't be that. Our son likes to be touched/hugged too much.

He's 11 and even now, if I turn on the vacuum cleaner or the disposal in the sink, he gets annoyed with me and covers his ears. Sometimes he goes as far as running into his room and shutting the door so he can't hear the noise as much because it bothers him THAT much. He can't handle certain textures in clothes and we've had to purchase long sleeved compression shirts to deal because it helps him not to want to be touched all the time since the shirt is hugging him tightly. Otherwise, it's all ""Can you hug me now please? I need hugs."" all the freaking time. Which is fine, every once in awhile, but I don't want to (and frankly cannot) spend all day holding my son."

Parenting,3dzsb4,ajwebb23,3,Tue Jul 21 02:37:54 2015 UTC,Definitely ask the pediatrician about OT services. I really think that even without a diagnosis it could really help a lot over time.
Parenting,3dzsb4,GAB104,2,Tue Jul 21 02:07:10 2015 UTC,"So my son (now 7) was recently diagnosed with ADHD but I personally think he has some form of SPD as he shares so many of the symptoms you name.  Here are some of the things that work for us to survive life.  :)  ""Often it's maybe related to his not telling us there's a problem (hungry, thirsty, tired, etc)"" For some reason - even at 7 - my son is still incapable of telling us these things.  Per our pediatrician - we give him food on a schedule whether he asks for it our not (even if it is just a few bites).  For example - in the summer we eat breakfast at 8, small snack around 10, lunch around 12:30, snack at 3:30, dinner at 6.  I don't give him an option - I just say ""here is your snack - have a few bites please"".  It sucks but I try to stay as close to possible this schedule.  (On a side note - our whole world is so much better if we stick to predictable routine).  This helps us avoid the ""Hangry"" melt downs.  We do a consistent bedtime routine and time.  A 6 year old needs 11-12 hours of sleep a night.  Yes - it often sucks to be the first to leave a party or have to skip the movie-in-the-park because my son has to go to bed but if we give him a later bedtime - we pay for it the next day.  The last one that was kind of hard to discover and causes us the most grief is when things don't go as my son expects them to.  (This may not be your sons problem but I think it worth mentioning).  I think this is often misunderstood as selfishness or stubbornness.   For example - we have to leave the birthday party early and we forget to tell my son before we get there - complete melt down. Before we go to the party we say ""we have to leave the party early to go to grandmas - we will probably miss the cake.  We know you will be sad when it is time to go but please use your words and not your tears"" - a little whining but no melt down.  We try the best we can to anticipate how a situation might or might not go but we obviously can't always.  We talk A LOT with my son what might happen when we go someplace new (especially if it will be loud as he hates that).  We talk every morning what we will do that day - we are careful with our language if something is iffy ""we might be able to go to the pool to day but if we don't - we will go next week"".  We try to give him as much notice as possible when it is time to leave, put toys away, etc (any kind of transition).  ""In 10 minutes we have to go to the store.  You will need to put your Pokemon cards away so we can go.  When we get home you can play again until dinner.""  We have lots of lists/charts in our home.  For example - we have a picture list of the 4 things he has to do before bed so he always knows the expectation.  (My son also hates brushing his teeth).    The good news is we have been doing these things for about two years now and he is learning to be more flexible which is helpful.  We now have one massive melt down a week maybe.  I do think he would have benefited from some OT for the SPD things.  I may push for it when we return to his therapist this fall even thought he does not have a SPD diagnosis.  As others have mentioned - I would also see your Ped.  I also really loved the book The Explosive Child by Rosse Green.  The methods in the book are kind of hard but it gave us HUGE insight into how our son works.  Good luck!!"

If my partner was making it difficult for me to be a good parent, that would be enough to make me think about at least temporarily living apart. Especially if he is negative about the kids?  Anyway, that aside, when things are hairy here and I need a sort of re-set, I re-read bits and pieces on ahaparenting.com. I also really like the book ""Liberated Parents, Liberated Children.""  It is my ""natural/default method,"" but I have a sometimes pretty stressful life (health hassles, which often mean income hassles, which mean everything else hassles) and my coping methods are centered around carving out time for me and making that utterly non-negotiable -- I have no free time but I do stuff like have dinner parties and go to beaches because I would be stark raving mad if I didn't make those things I have to do no matter what else is going on.  That and when I feel like my kid is out to drive me up the wall I like to grit my teeth and pour on the love and understanding. Ten effing minutes is all it takes (at most) to re-set her, so to speak. Better to be kneeling down or hugging and talking empathetically about how when you were that age you thought it wasn't fair too, etc, for ten minutes than to be snipping at each other off and on for hours. (And if you do snip -- lead by example, and be the one to apologise. When my 7yo is a jerk it takes very little time before I get a very sincere ""Mum. I want to say sorry. I was being rude to you and I'm very sorry."")"

Yes, I'm considering a temporary situation.  Dreading it but it might be what has to happen.  I do take a lot of time to myself which is nice, and actually I enjoy the kids very much and have little trouble when we're not at home (husband works from home).  There's no amount of decompressing and re-setting that is sufficient for dealing with the home atmosphere.  Writing this it seems like separating is a no-brainer, but inside it's so much more confusing.  Thankfully I am good at apologizing.  It hasn't paid off as far as it being reciprocated by anyone in the family, but it assures the kids I love them when I do get snippy and creates an overall positive feeling between us.

Parenting,3e0uk8,DivinelyMinely,2,Tue Jul 21 06:40:58 2015 UTC,"I try to use positive discipline, too. I think the hardest part about it is that it requires the parent to have a lot of patience. That is difficult for some.   If you're under a lot of stress, let the kids know! Obviously you do not need to tell them why you're stressed, but if you find yourself blowing up on them when you normally wouldn't, or less capable of handling the noise than normal, they can understand that. I went through a phase where I was overwhelmed and a bit depressed. I would avoid yelling at my kids by warning them that I had a short fuse that day. Usually, they understood and would try harder to not go crazy because they felt for me.   Also, don't beat yourself up for it. Positive disciplinary methods are wonderful, but there is merit to kids realizing how difficult they are being, too. Sometimes it takes a bit of a blow-up for them to see how inappropriate their behavior is.   And, again, always apologize if you think you crossed a line and handled a situation poorly. Seeing parents admit to mistakes is incredibly powerful."

As far as I've observed in our family punitive discipline results in driving an emotional wedge between parent and child, fostering resentment and isolation."
Parenting,3e0uk8,wtadams,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:32:34 2015 UTC,"Quoting from that Wikipedia page you cited on Positive Discipline:  ""In the terms used by psychology research, positive discipline uses the full range of reinforcement and punishment options: Positive reinforcement, such as complimenting a good effort; Negative reinforcement, such as ignoring requests made in a whining tone of voice; Positive punishment, such as requiring a child to clean up a mess he made; and Negative punishment, such as removing a privilege in response to poor behavior.""  Is that what you want to do with your kid?  Note that that list included methods that could be characterized as natural consequences like cleaning up after yourself, and punitive measures like removing privileges.  So, that does not seem, on the face of it, to be that far from what your husband wants to do?  But, are you against those methods?  Do you have a more limiting view of ""positive discipline"" that rejects these methods?  I agree that punishment should not be the first resort and it should be avoided as much as possible.  By the way, do you use planned ignoring?  It's on that list from the wikipedia article.  The book ""Explosive Child"" is good on collaborative problem solving.  But note that it must be proactive, not reactive.  One should not try to problem solve as an immediate reaction to bad behavior, something like ignoring is a good immediate reaction. Or, what do you think is a good immediate reaction?  Do your kids engage in bad behaviors that cannot be ignored, like hurting others? What do you think the proper immediate reaction to that kind of behavior should be, given that you seem to reject time out and you should not that collaborative problem solving should not be use in the heat of the moment."

A lot of people are going to say that one day you'll miss being able to pick him up — but I think they mean more that you'll miss your kiddo being small and cuddly and dependent more than actively having to lug around 35 squirmy pounds.  We would pick up our oldest a lot and now he leans on us to do a lot of things that I see other 5-year-olds doing without much fuss. So, I would say you want to start laying the groundwork now that you aren't going to constantly carry him around places. (In contrast, his 2-year-old brother, who due to timing we cannot coddle as much, never wants us to help with ANYthing. He is fiercely independent.)  If he wants to cuddle with Daddy on the couch, go nuts. But if he needs you to carry him while you walk to the park, maybe turn it into a race so he's not always trying to get you to do the work for him."

I do this a lot, because he wants it and because, if I don't, it will be a slooooow walk. Even with me trying to rush him, one block can take 30 minutes (if we ever get to the end at all). :)  2) At home is the bigger issue for me. As I say, he demands a lot of attention and seldom plays on his own. Frequently he will ask to be picked up. It's ""easy"" for me because it at least allows me to continue doing stuff (while holding him) instead of being dominated by his universe, but I think I need to start doing the ""daddy can't play with you right now"" sometimes.

It won't be useful at all locations but if he's up for that kinda game it might at least speed up a few parts of a walk.  At home, when you're holding while doing stuff, can you talk to him about what you're doing? He might get his hug quota filled faster if they are a bit interactive and maybe he'll learn about whatever you're doing. Especially if what he wants is for you to talk to him as well. Maybe he could be your helper in some tasks, and get used to sitting close to you (like if you are cooking), and counting how many times you stir something.  Training him to be used to you going away and coming back might help him to play alone. ""In a minute I'm going to go do X and come back!"" ""Now I am going to go do X!"" ""I'm doing X now, I'll be right back!"" ""Okay, I'm all done X and I'm back!"" You could start with short durations (get a glass of water) and stretch them out."

He's only been able to stand a bit longer than that. In other words, his little muscles have no stamina yet. A block is short by objective standards, but to him, it's HUGE. How many trips across the living room is that, or even laps around the playground? He might just need a rest.  When my daughter was that age and I needed to wean her from being carried (actually a bit younger, because I was pregnant with her brother), I'd just sit down on the curb and wait for her to be ready to move again, letting her know what we were doing and why. If she wanted to be carried, I told her no, sat down on the curb, and told her we could keep walking any time she was ready. I think it took us an hour and a half to go 1 km the first time. Now at four, she STILL sits on the curb if she's tired when walking, but tired comes more after 3 km or so.

Parenting,3dyd11,sadsappysucker,8,Mon Jul 20 15:33:24 2015 UTC,"So many thoughtful replies. Thank you all! I'm surprised at how helpful it is just to read other peoples' opinions. I've read books on the topic and am psychologically minded, but it is thought provoking and reassuring to hear from the real experiences of other parents.  More background for anyone who cares:  The question about holding is really incidental compared to the bigger question that I only eluded to: Basically, I'm scared that I could be inadvertently coddling my toddler. I certainly try not to, but the results are hard to ignore. Compared to others his age that I have met:   He is extremely shy around anyone that he doesn't know very well. For example, if a neighbour says hi to him, he will become paralyzed until they have gone away. Sometimes he is even very shy around some family that he knows pretty well. He is (physically & emotionally) attached to his daddy, if and when he can be. I try to give him what he seems to need, which is where the fear of coddling comes from. Random example: If we go to a park and I try to stay on the sidelines while he plays, he will most likely insist that I come play with him. If I say, no, I'm going to just watch, he'll probably just stick to me (or stay within two feet of me). It looks like I'm a helicopter parent, but I swear, it feels like I have a helicopter son. :) He is at that perfectly annoying stage of wanting to do things on his own but not really being able to, which feeds into his need for my support. My instinct tells me that I should let him fail more, on his own, but in practice I'm finding this hard to implement. If he fails and then asks me to do something, should I really insist he tries more on his own? I suggest, but I don't insist... To answer several: Yea I use the delay strategy with everything, and maybe I just need to do more and more of it. It works, but it feels as though it's peanuts compared to the bigger picture.   Someone mentioned resentment. I don't resent. Yea, it's hard, but I would keep doing it (for as long as I can) so long as I was sure that I'm doing the right thing. Instead, I'm scared that I'm doing him a disservice and that I should be helping him (gradually) separate from me somehow. My behavior is motivated by helping build his sense of security, but I'm scared that it has done the opposite."
Parenting,3dyd11,DisneyWench,11,Mon Jul 20 18:50:26 2015 UTC,"Shyness around new situations/adults is completely normal. I think you should be okay with letting him ""helicopter"" you at the park and other new situations. He's clinging close to you because he wants to observe how things work from the comfort of your lap (or beside you, whichever you allow). I think this is great and normal, but you shouldn't let him climb you if that's what he's after.   Regarding letting him fail - absolutely yes, go with your instincts and let him fail (if you have the time and the space to allow him to fail).   Example: I have a home daycare and I allow the kids to take off their shoes in the sandbox. The other day a little (18 mo) girl came up to me and asked me to take her shoes off. They were very simple crocs, and I knew she was able to get them ON by herself, and I wanted her to figure out how to do it. So I said ""No, I want you to learn how to get them off. Why don't I help you with my words?""   She gave a half-ass effort for a few moments, but quickly became frustrated and asked me with MORE vigor to help. I stuck to my guns and let her protest my decision to not help. I told her ""You're not ready to work on that right now. Maybe later you'll be ready.""  She had a screaming fit for about 20 minutes, and never got those Crocs off.   A few more days passed with exactly this scenario playing out. But then, one day, she asked me to take her Crocs off, I said no, and she immediately sat down and pulled them off, one right after the other, and promptly hopped in the sandbox all the while smirking at me as if to say, ""I did it, you bitch!""   I resisted helping her all those times because I know that even though it's easier in the moment to help, I am robbing her of that proud moment where she does it ALL ON HER OWN, without any help from me. I want every kid to experience that feeling as much as possible. It is hard to listen to their sobbing cries in the moment, but I've done this enough times that I know it is for their own good.   If we have the time and space for toddler skill acquisition, I will let them struggle and practice. If we were about to on a walk, though, I'd encourage her to try to put shoes on herself, but if she wasn't able to, I'd help her out so that we could get out the door in time. I'd let her struggle with something non-essential like a coat zipper, but probably not snapping her own diaper. :)  From what I understand, it sounds like your toddler is becoming preoccupied with finding firm boundaries. This explains the behavior of demanding constant attention from you. When you delay picking him up, rather than just giving him a clear ""no"" it shows him that you are uncomfortable with telling him ""no."" And in turn, that makes HIM uncomfortable, because children regulate their own emotions by vibing off ours. If you aren't comfortable with not picking him up, how can HE ever be expected to get comfortable with it? If not being picked up is so scary that it makes mommy act this way, then I don't ever want to not be picked up!  So, is the answer to just pick him up every time he asks?   No. You said yourself this is unsustainable, and it's causing actual physical and emotional stress. The answer is to get really comfortable with your child's discomfort.   Example: You want to do the dishes but your toddler is asking to be picked up. Flies are starting to hover, and the dishes really need to be loaded into the dishwasher so they can be clean for dinner later. You've put it off all morning because your son has screamed ""up"" every time he notices that you're in the kitchen.    ""Well, toddler, it's time for me to go do these dishes. I'm going to be in the kitchen, I'll be back in a few minutes."" You turn and go into the kitchen. Your toddler follows you, screaming ""Uuup!""  ""Wow, you really want me to pick you up, huh?"" Nods ""I need to do the dishes. I love you, and I will pick you up after I'm done. You'll know when I'm ready because you'll hear the dishwasher turn on!""   At this point, he's likely full-on wailing. Since you've already validated his feelings, heard his point of view, and explained yours, you can feel confident about just taking care of the dishes calmly while he either stays in the other room or watches you.   I have helped many many parents successfully assert boundaries with their toddlers, and a common behavior at this age is to hit or slap mom and dad when they aren't getting what they want. If he does this, I'd just say ""I hear that you're upset, but I'm not going to let you hit me. I'm going to close the baby gate now to protect my body."" And you calmly separate him on the other side of the baby gate.   You finish your dishes, WITHOUT constantly looking over your shoulder, WITHOUT talking to him in a ""poor baby"" voice, WITHOUT putting on a show to make him feel better. Just do the damn dishes, like you said you would, calmly come out of the kitchen, and say ""I'm ready to pick you up now! Are you ready too?"" And you pick him up.   You can say ""You were having a hard time waiting for me to finish the dishes"" without using a ""pity-party"" voice. Use an empowering voice! I like to tell parents use a ""therapist's"" voice.   Certainly if you're not doing anything else, and you actually WANT to pick him up, by all means pick him up! More than anything else, I think it's the ""delay strategy"" that is causing your son to demand constant attention. Not playing alone is another common behavior in children who need a firm boundary.   http://www.janetlansbury.com/2013/10/the-real-reasons-toddlers-push-limits/ Just read all of Janet Lansbury's blog and you should be good."

We all want to do the right thing and have our child be independent but every child is different and will adjust differently. Have you heard of baby wearing? That helps a lot with the children that want to be carried and frees up your hands too. Kids need security and he probably really likes that from you. Knowing that he isnt being put off to the side because of the new baby. Hang in there and try what works best for you, but like most have said this too will pass. One day he wont want to be Carried at all or hold your hand and want to do everything by himself. Its our job to give them that confidence."

He is painfully shy and it takes him some time to warm up to people, even those he knows reasonably well.  He's been like this since forever.  It can be extremely frustrating as you (and I) know life would be so much easier if he let go of the fears and played/interacted with ease.  I too have had to be a constant playmate at the playground and watch enviously the other parents whose children run off and play happily on their own, or make friends at the park!  I am STILL having give him lots of attention and he likes constant activity so it makes it difficult.  One thing that has really helped, is having his younger brother come along! He is the polar opposite of my oldest son.  He's outgoing and cruisy as.  This has really given him lots of confidence.  I really don't think you can change their personality.  My son (and maybe yours) will probably always been a somewhat shy and reserved child in public.  I just try to help him gain confidence, and not make him feel bad for needing my reassurance.  I think what you're doing (building his sense of security) is completely correct.  But little ones cannot change their behaviour as quickly as adults as they don't have those skills yet, but you can still help guide and build that security and trust, and the foundations are set for a happy and confident child."
Parenting,3dyd11,flaminghotbutthole,12,Tue Jul 21 00:11:52 2015 UTC,"A lot of companies make ""Toddler Carriers"" if you can afford them - Tula, Lenny Lamb, Connecta (I think), Beco Soleil.  Mine is a couple months shy of 3 and our baby is 7 months. My husband carries him whenever he asks in our Toddler Tula. (""Daddy? Can I go in the carrier? Can I be close to you?"" You never catch a teenage saying that...)   Last winter when I was heavily pregnant and couldn't carry my son he would hardly walk 10 feet with me (luckily the stroller was enough of a novelty to entice him since he had been carried most of his life to that point) but would walk for kilometeres with my husband. The difference was that my husband always had the carrier and was always willing and able to carry my son, so he didn't need to insist on having that willingness proved all the time. Since I couldn't carry him, he wouldn't walk for me. Spring time brought Strider (balance bike) season and he will go anywhere with me on his bike now.  The other thing is that the back half of the 3rd year (around 28-29 months to about 3 years) is a big developmental spike in separation anxiety. So independent of new sibling, they need more continuous talking/interaction than the several months before. It's driving me crazy - it's like he can't go more than 5 minutes without talking to me - but it's starting to abate slightly. Nothing is forever.  Get a carrier. Hold him as much as you can without resenting him. When you get to that point, set a firm and kind limit, let him cry and empathize with his feelings. Give him a hug if he needs it but don't pick him up."

Parenting,3dyd11,NotEnoughSprinkles,2,Mon Jul 20 15:52:12 2015 UTC,"I think at 2.5 years it's still OK to carry your child a good chunk of the time. It all depends on the kid. Sounds like your son is feeling clingy because of the new baby, so I'd indulge this habit for maybe the next couple weeks as he continues to adjust, even if it's tough for you.  Sometimes with my 2.5yo I have to explain I have too much to carry and she has to walk, etc. Usually if she knows and understands why (or can help carry something of her own) she won't freak out as bad.  But in terms of inside stores and whatnot, I only allow her to walk around if she's behaving. The second she stops listening or bolts, she's in my arms again. I think that's just common sense when you have a toddler - not to give too much freedom or else it will interfere with other people's abilities to go about their days.  TL;DR: Depends on the kid and depends on the situation, but I'd indulge him for now while he adjusts to baby."

I have been seen with one on the left shoulder and one on the right in bed at nap time. There are days when this/requests for attention presses my sanity. On those days I tell them I'll pick you up/read to you/watch with you/play with you in a little while. I like to give a specific amount of time so they don't feel strung along.  If I'm having a particularly tough moment (with the baby or whatnot) my toddler will attempt to take care of me (serve me a glass of water or whatever). Which is adorable. It really depends. Sometimes you need a break. You are a person and have needs to. Your kids can learn to respect that. You are not a 24 hour entertainment center. But if you think your kid should be walking more, hold their hand and say you'll pick them up at the halfway point so that you don't get too tired.  You do need to set boundaries with your kids, but one day you'll realize you haven't been asked to pick them up in a few months and that you've probably carried them for the last time.

Ask for very easy things at first, things he is likely to do without balking.   Note that these small tasks might not be all that helpful to you, might take more time to work with him, but this prompting, compliance, praise game will pay off in other ways.  This sort of attention can be a twofer: attention to the baby and the 2.5 yo at the same time.

Skipping cleaning would deprive the child of an orderly environment, which children also need.

And yes, sometimes it's ok to avoid leaving home, or walking, or taking a bike.  The key is to evaluate this particular trip and this particular starting time, and decide whether they are more or less important than the feelings of the helpless person who loves you and is entirely dependent on you."
Parenting,3dyd11,nakamura_branchevska,2,Tue Jul 21 16:22:10 2015 UTC,"I only take issue with the use of the words ""rejected"" and ""helpless.""  I think these ideas are adult constructs that we project onto children. How can you know for sure if he's feeling ""rejected"" that he's watching you do the dishes, or if he's actually just feeling tired, hungry, sad, angry, bored, or jealous? Perhaps he's feeling a mixture of all of those things, but the dictionary definition of ""reject"" is ""fail to show due affection or concern for (someone)."" Certainly your child is due affection, but will that affection be authentic if your back hurts from carrying him for 5 hours? If you know the dishes need to be done? OP herself said this constant attention-giving is ""unsustainable.""   If there's anything I've learned about toddlers over the years I've been caring for them, it's that they are capable, intuitive, and resilient WHOLE people. You say toddlers are ""helpless"" and ""entirely dependent"" on adults, but I have found the opposite to be true when caregivers have trust in them. Often, I am amazed at just how efficiently they process negative emotions (when they have been allowed to safely experience them). As an adult, I sometimes seem more affected and scared by negative emotions than many of the toddlers I know!  The way kids learn to deal with disappointment is by practicing, ideally with the support of a loving and understanding caregiver who listens and keeps them safe. ""You really wanted me to pick you up, and I didn't. I understand. I would be upset too.""  I'm not saying never hold your kid. I'm saying kids thrive when they have:    Parents and carers who are clear on what they want and expect from children and others, and who are confident asserting personal boundaries. Opportunities for conflict, disagreement, and disappointment. Instead of trying to ""fix"" struggles or sad feelings, parents and carers let children know that all feelings (including sadness) are safe and okay."

""Certainly your child is due affection, but will that affection be authentic if your back hurts from carrying him for 5 hours? "" As long as it feels authentic to the recipient, who cares?  But, for the record - it's ok to hold the kid on the couch.  Or lying down.  Or even to ask him to rub your back instead.  As long as there is affectionate physical contact when requested the specific type of contact is probably not as important.    ""If you know the dishes need to be done? "" See, that's a perfect example of our differences.  I say - fuck the dishes, if doing them cuts into my cuddle time I'm ok with doing them tomorrow or even eating off paper.  ""OP herself said this constant attention-giving is ""unsustainable."""" Right, which is why I asked whether anything else could be cut instead.  Dishes, for instance.  ""Often, I am amazed at just how efficiently they process negative emotions (when they have been allowed to safely experience them)"" The problem with ""often"" is that it isn't ""always"" and I, for one, would not want to find my kid's breaking point empirically.  Learning to experience and process negative emotions is a good thing.  But it's not a good thing to add extra negative emotions to the ones already existing.  Why not wait until the kid is under less stress?  Yes, it's difficult for the parent, but handling difficulties and ameliorating their effect on the kid is the parent's primary job."
Parenting,3dyd11,Ajs1004,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:43 2015 UTC,"My point about authenticity is that it WONT feel authentic to the child if you are inwardly annoyed. Children are highly perceptive of adult emotions, but really bad at understanding them. They pick up on nonverbal cues, on expressions, on tone of voice. They can tell when you are annoyed, but they don't want to be seen as annoying. This is why rhythm and boundaries go hand in hand. Eventually, your child just understands that every day at 11:45, mom does the dishes from lunch whether I want her to or not. She always closes the door to the bathroom when she needs to poop, but not if it's just pee. She always picks me up if I hurt myself. She never carries me on the way to the park, but usually carries me on the way back home. She never picks me up to stop nursing my brother, but she will hold my hand. She never lets me hit her, but she always lets me push on her hands when I'm upset.  A child who no longer has to ask the same questions over and over is a child who is comfortable with his parent's leadership. That's not to say that he won't occasionally protest established limits, but these protests are just that - occasional. Not a constant, chronic thing.   Constantly demanding attention is a sign of an insecure child, especially if his preoccupation with being held, etc, starts to affect his ability to play independently. Certainly you would expect tantrums, regression, and clingy behavior to start to increase after the birth of a sibling, but you can't expect these behaviors to pass if you don't remain consistent with your boundaries.    The problem with ""often"" is that it isn't ""always"" and I, for one, would not want to find my kid's breaking point empirically.   But it's not a good thing to add extra negative emotions to the ones already existing. Why not wait until the kid is under less stress?    For that matter, why not wait to have a baby until your toddler gives you the go ahead? Why not wait to do the dishes until your kid stops crying? Why not leave the door open while you change your tampon until the kid is less ""stressed"" about not being in your sight. Why not wash your toddlers favorite cup, and transfer all his food into it even though the bowl you already gave him is clean? Why not wait for your toddler to give you permission to leave him at daycare, even though it makes you late for work and you're getting written up every time?   Certainly all of us would have different approaches to the above situations. Some really don't care if our child sees our bloody tampon or poop, etc.   My point: Sometimes life gives you lemons, even when you already have a fucking truckful. Tis the nature of life. Your mom has another baby that needs attention. Your kid gets cancer. Your wife cheats on you. You get laid off. Your mom dies. None of us are ever ""primed and ready"" to experience all that life has to throw at us.   So, the answer to ""Why not wait?"" for me, is because sometimes life doesn't wait.   I matter. As a carer, as a member of the family, and as a fellow human being - I matter. I get to say whether the door is open or closed when I poop. Even if there is a young child in the house. I'm happy to cuddle, hug, sing to, carry, rock, and soothe children most of the day, but it's important that we do it in a way BOTH can enjoy. It doesn't mean I won't make sacrifices, or that it's always about the parent's wishes.   I think that constantly giving into toddler whims (notice I didn't say ""needs"")  creates the stress that you suggest waiting on. Sure, the new baby is a source of much of that stress, but more than anything it sounds like parental discomfort with with their child's discomfort leading to the child constantly testing and demanding attention.    It's been wonderful to discuss this with you and hear your ideas. I think we agree on much. And I think OP phrased the title of this post unfortunately by asking if she should ""stop"" picking up her child. I don't think anyone thinks that's the right answer!"

It may very well be that your son expresses love through touch, and at that young age he will still need a lot of physical reassurance. If you can't actually pick him up because the baby needs you, make sure you are continually giving him physical affection, like hugs, pats on the back, holding his hand. Also make a time in the day (bedtime is easy) when you make time only for him, when he is your sole focus, even if it's just reading a couple stories.  He may be feeling insecure as the new baby demands your attention, so as much as possible give him other forms of attention. If he is asking you to look at something take a moment to acknowledge him. Just put in that little extra effort as you can. Also, there are a couple things you can do. Get him lots of exercise whenever possible, like taking him to the playground or family walks, so he has more time to be tired and less time to notice you are not paying attention to him. A play date with another kid his age will do wonders for him and your arms. And find ways to get him involved in ""helping"" with the baby. Mostly this will not actually be helping, like the train wreck of a two year old folding baby onesies or putting away bottles, but this will give him a feeling of responsibility and importance, and help him cope with his feelings for the interloper. As always, you have to balance taking care of yourself and taking care of your little ones. You aren't doing him any favors in the long run if you're coddling him, but he's still so little that he may just need a gradual lessening of attention."

Then Mommy got pregnant and all of a sudden things started to change.  She had more appointments, he probably moved into a toddler bed and/or into his own room, things started getting ready for the baby, and he is feeling left behind.    Try ""dating"" your toddler.  Go out on daddy and me activities and have your wife do the same... without the baby. Activities can be simple things: go out for ice cream, go to the park, go to a movie, family movie night after the baby has gone to bed (and he gets to stay up a little later than normal)... absolutely anything counts as long as he knows he's the focus of your time."

My kids are about this age apart... What I did to help my son adjust to the new baby was his baby sister gave him a gift to tell him how happy she was to meet him, which was a set on his favorite item at the time (construction cars). I told him that her tapping and grabbing was the way babies say they love you, which helped him form a bond with her. Instead of getting mad she was hitting he started hugging her and telling her he loves her too. Tantrums go into high gear after 2.5 as well, and it'll likely be pretty bad for a year or so. It's really a personal choice if you want to keep carrying him. If you want to wean him off of being carried you could try things like ""I'm going to put you down in the store so you can walk around"", or ""I want you to walk on your own so we can race"". Another thing that worked with my son was telling him he could get a treat (a piece of fruit) from the store if he walked on his own and stayed with me. Sometimes games can make them not notice transition. Note that if you've always carried him and suddenly stop right when the new baby comes he may connect the two events."

In fact, at my previous job (another daycare) I was told I couldn't leave work when I was having diarrhea and to just ""suck it up until 5:00!""   It sounds like you're asking for advice on how to confidentally and comfortably assert boundaries with the parents! Here's what I do:    At the beginning of the year, I have a new parent orientation where all the parents come with their handbooks and we go over the rules face to face. It gives them a chance to ask questions, and it gives me a chance to explain the reasoning behind my rules. I always stress that the policy is for the health of the CHILD and other CHILDREN. Sure, it's an annoyance for adult to have to take off work. But sick and convalescing children need to be home, in a non-stimulating, familiar, and comfortable environment. I am always flabbergasted when parents act put out, as if it's MY JOB to care for their sick kids. Nope. We are a well-child facility. I don't have staff to go and sit with your sick kid while he vomits in the office. I am a one-man show. Some daycares are staffed to deal with sick children, and they do accept sick kids. I suggest finding a list of such facilities and handing them out to parents at the beginning of the year.  I have empathy for the parents. ""Man, I know it sucks to have to take off work. I hate taking off when I/my kids are sick too. Hey, at least your kid loves it! I know how glad little Sally will be to have her mom/dad taking care of her - she's had a really rough day here!"" When I have done all of the above and I still get back talk, I threaten.    ""Hey, I know it's been such a burden to have to take off work so much, but these are my policies. It sounds like our program may not be the right fit for your family - we are a well-child facility and you need sick care. I would love to make this work, but if you can't pick her up when she's sick I will need to terminate enrollment."""

It seems reasonable to me- I don't want my kid around other sick kids, and so I keep her out when she's sick.  My husband or I use one of our sick/personal days and stay home with her.  It sucks, but it's kind of the deal with a kid in daycare."

Parenting,3dzlkl,ch1cgeek,4,Tue Jul 21 21:28:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know my son's daycare's sick policy exactly but it's something like ""if your child is too sick to play, then your child is too sick to come to daycare."" It also states that if there are x amount of diarrhea (I think two in a four-hour period), a fever, or vomiting that the child must stay home for 24 hours after that.  I think, like your daycare, they make exceptions for children with frequent fevers due to ear infections or teething with a doctor's note.  I am a single parent, so when my son is sick, I stay home. I'm a full-time student right now so it's not too bad if I have to stay home, but a few months ago he got rotavirus and I missed classes for two weeks. I was panicking at the idea that this could very well occur once I graduate and start working. That was a real moment for me, thinking about how if I was out for two weeks at a new job, they very well might fire me and, even if they didn't, I would have missed a whole pay period and then how would I pay bills? It was a tough realization of what my future looks like but I wouldn't have a choice.  I'm sure it is frustrating for you to hear a parent complaining that they have to take care of their own sick kid, but it can be really stressful to figure out who is going to stay home from work, and even more stressful if they can't afford to miss a day of work. I would just be empathetic, tell them you understand how frustrating it can be, but you don't have the space or the staff to isolate a sick child from the healthy ones."

I am lucky in that my partner and I both have very flexible jobs, either one of us can take off work or work from home if we need to."

I'm not advocating for this situation just saying not all adults can relate to getting to go home when they feel sick.  That being said your polices are reasonable (and I don't believe you get to set them anyway). No matter what your policy is there will always be a parent who doesn't like it. I get that dealing with angry parents is not a fun part of the job but it's not completely avoidable either. Just make sure parents know about the polices in advance (from when they first start with the agency) and be polite but clear about it in the face of whatever they say. You can sympathize with them if you want or give a reason if you want (it's to keep the other children well, they wouldn't want their child exposed). Remember, you're the professional in this situation and act it."

Faking it with tylenol/advil is just shitty. As for not leaving work to get their kid if they actually find out part way through they are sick I agree they should since those are the terms they agreed to when placing them in your care (hopefully?). That being said it's unfair to assume that the parents just care more about work. Not all jobs allow you to leave in the middle of the day.  I had a previous job where leaving mid way through my shift could have put people in genuine danger and might have been illegal depending on the staffing situation that day/moment. I worked with a migraine because I caught it mid-shift and it wasn't a time I could safely leave my co-workers. I know this probably isn't a common reason but I think we always need to be careful about assumptions. Unless we know that parent's situation we don't know it.
Parenting,3dzlkl,jenna_r,2,Tue Jul 21 06:52:46 2015 UTC,My daughter isn't in daycare however I was a coprovider for one. We were pretty laid back and just said if the kid is contagious and/or will need extra care that takes attention away from the other children. So if your kid comes in with an ear infection we will allow them but with a warning that if they need constant attention that's taking away from the other children that we would be sending them home.  All parents are told the policy before signing the enrollment agreement. It was only a problem on one occasion and we dropped the family from our program because they kept bringing their child in sick.   We were nice and would keep children sometimes if they weren't contagious however :) We understood that work is also important.
Parenting,3dzlkl,NatskuLovester,2,Mon Jul 20 21:34:35 2015 UTC,"My daycares have had similar policies. I used to get frustrated because of the inconvenience and because sometimes the kids were perfectly fine a few hours later. I know that's not the right way to feel, but it's the truth.  We then used a daycare that didn't strictly enforce and THAT was frustrating. The amount of bugs that went around that place was insane. One morning, they had a kid segregated (I'm assuming for early pickup) with the worst case of pink eye I've ever seen. No idea how they didn't notice at drop off or that the parent thought it was ok.   We were VERY happy to return to one of the original day cares (LO was only at the new one for a short time before she was old enough for one of the originals)."

Coughs are allowed (thank goodness, as my kid had a cough for month due to reflux) and mild sniffles etc.  Its alright for me as I'm not working right now so if kiddo is sick she just stays home with me. When I was working I just took the day off (parents here are entitled to take time off with sick kids under the age of 10 that doesn't come out of their normal time off. Not paid though.) so perfectly fair for where I live and it works - not many bugs get spread around the daycares because of the strict rules."

This is exactly my home daycare's policy, and if you drop your child off first thing and they exhibit any of these symptoms you will be called to pick them up. If it occurs a couple hours before pick-up she will separate the sick child and the assistant will work with the well children.   I see nothing wrong with this policy, and yes while it's never convenient to have to make arrangements with work to take a sick day, that's part of being a parent and is seriously not your fault. If they have issue with staying home with a sick child they should make other arrangements. It's not fair to put the burden of caring for a sick child on you. You are not a nanny you are a daycare provider and are also responsible for other children, a sick child takes a lot more attention, that you would be taking away from the other children. It will affect your routine/plans for the day and not to mention potentially infect more kids.

While it IS inconvenient people need to understand that it's so your sick kid doesn't get every other kid in the school sick. I cannot tell you how many times a teacher at my sons school didn't keep their sick kid home and the entire class then got sick. My son was hospitalized twice because of this. He also got walking pneumonia. Every time my son is sick I keep him home multiple days. There was one week where he had a fever of 106. I was working 12hr overnight shifts at the time. I kept him home for 5 days AND still worked my normal work schedule with only 2hrs of sleep a day. Was it inconvenient? Yes. Would I feel like a complete asshole if my kid got more kids sick? Yup. While it sucks that you have to stay home......stop bringing your sick kids to school.   There is one mom in my school that ALWAYS tries to get this by the teachers. I wont lie, I've tattled on her more than once when our kids were under 2. I'm sorry but if your kid has green snot dripping out of his face and he looks like shit, you need to figure out home to keep him home and I'm not going to let that shit slide around my kid.   I think it's great you are enforcing the policy. I know some of the assistant teachers at my daycare are somewhat intimidated by a few of the parents at my school and like to tiptoe around confronting them. But we are paying the school to look after our children. This includes keeping them in as healthy an environment as possible. Our teachers leave handouts at the beginning of the really bad cold season about the sick policy and that parents are required to keep their kids home if they have had a fever/diarrhea/vomiting for 24hrs. If the school knows your kid has had a fever the day before, they will not let you drop off your kid (if you try). If you feel a parent is being too aggressive towards you then have them speak with your director. Be firm but as nice as you can.

She asked her mom if she could jump off the diving board when she came back and mom said to wait a sec because dad wanted catch her and dad was getting in so mom was waiting for him to get in before putting the vest back on. About 3 minutes later she realized she was holding the vest and we didn't see her daughter ""K."" We looked in the pool but the deepest part was actually a little murky on the bottom like a lake because our neighbors just hadn't quite gotten it to clear up completely yet but it tested just fine. So we didn't see K at the bottom of the pool. We looked in the house and in the yard and up the street real quick even before we found her at the bottom. She was completely blue and honestly dead. Blood had pooled to her back and the back of legs. It was terrifying. I had just gotten certified in CPR  last year for scouts and immediately started CPR while my husband called 911. It took about 5 minutes for her to breathe. CPR saved her. And 4 other adults there knew it and held previous certifications but panicked. I cannot say I would have been able to do it if it were my kid. So my advice is to make sure you know CPR. You may not be able to take a class before your trip but you can watch videos and learn.

I was much more relaxed once there, especially when I saw that she was a little afraid of the waves.  Did I watch her like an obsessive-compulsive hawk?  You betcha. My eyes were never off her. Not for a second. And we took a number of common-sense precautions:   We never drank while on the beach. We reserved beer/wine time for when we were all locked inside the beach house for the evening. This kept my SO and I alert when we were on the beach.  We locked the doors whenever we went inside to ensure no accidental escaping.  We always had clear communication regarding who was in charge of watching our daughter. There was never any ambiguity.  USCG certified life vest. Although we did take it off when not right near the water.    I think the biggest thing is always be clear on who is watching the child. And if you don't trust anyone to do it, do it yourself. When we were at the beach there was a big family there with a number of kids and adults. There was a toddler (1-2 years old) and I guess the parents thought the grandparents were watching him and vice versa. I was watching them from the balcony of our beach house and watched the toddler make his way to the water. I was horrified. I felt like everything was in slow motion and I was about to start screaming to get their attention when the mother turned around and caught him at the last minute, right as a wave knocked him over.

Sometimes you just want to go to the toilette, get your forgotten phone from the house, get water for your toddler...without him taking with you (simply because I am three times faster that way), and still be sure, that he is not actually drowning. Specially when you have a bit of chaotic family activity like a BBQ, often everyone thinks, the other are anyway watching, and then accidants can happen.  Always have an eye on him, when he plays directly at the sealine on the beach. Even when there was an hourlong no real tide difference, then out of nothing can come a bigger wave that is sufficient to pull a toddler from its legs."

It is endlessly less of a big deal with just the one kid and so many extra adults.   Statistically the odds of you all perishing in a car wreck en route are almost certainly higher than the odds of a drowning. (Please don't worry about the car.) Known risks, known risks that I can mitigate, are my favourite risks. Don't have any distractions (phone, booze...). Make sure a distraction-free grown-up is in charge of watching the kid at all times, and make it really clear when there's a changing of the guard -- not okay for them to go ""yeah yeah"" while still having their conversation; they should say ""Right!"" and get up and focus."
Parenting,3dyksp,biglettuce,15,Mon Jul 20 16:15:06 2015 UTC,"If she did it once and apologized and seems to understand why it's bad I would not worry. If she's been awesome with the baby for 2 weeks that's one lapse in around 200 hours together. That's not bad.   My 3 year old crunched the baby once. Left teeth marks and everything. I think she was just curious what would happen. I really don't know. She often chews on her and says she's delicious and whatnot, but the one time she actually went crunch. I still leave them alone together (watch your sister while I go grab XYZ from the basement). We didn't make a big deal about it (of course we corrected it and required an apology), I think the SHRIEKING she caused was enough of a lesson. LOL. She's a good big sister."
Parenting,3dyksp,Ridry,5,Mon Jul 20 17:01:33 2015 UTC,"Ours are about that far apart, and we've spent a lot of time talking and practicing a ""gentle touch.""  Close supervision too, of course, especially while the newborn is so  fragile.  Yesterday, she whacked her sister on the arm.  I picked her up, set her in time-out (the hallway, which is enclosed by three doors and a babygate) for two minutes.  Then I asked her why she was in time-out...she said ""hit [sister's] arm"" then ""sorry [sister].""   Then we sat down together and practiced playing nicely."
Parenting,3dyksp,merganzer,9,Mon Jul 20 17:24:52 2015 UTC,"Lots of supervision is pretty much the only way to go. Also, making her repeat why she has to be nice to the baby and be there with her to show her how to show her affection to her sibling."
Parenting,3dyksp,carlinha1289,11,Mon Jul 20 16:50:15 2015 UTC,"You can't trust a 2yo around a baby. So correct the behavior as you would in any other circumstance, including talking about how we don't hit, etc. But do not leave the toddler alone with your infant. Once your infant is, say, a year old and able to defend himself, then you might transition into the 'let 'um battle' mode if he's as big as his older sister where she'll eventually realize that she might want to steer clear. But until then? It's almost like having 2 oscar fish."
Parenting,3dyksp,albeaner,3,Mon Jul 20 17:42:40 2015 UTC,"Kind of a tough instruction to follow though. I mean, no one's going to leave a toddler and infant ""alone"", but it'd be hard to find someone who never lets them out of sight for a few moments here and there. (Taking dinner from oven, using toilet, etc.)"
Parenting,3dyksp,Zifna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:41:46 2015 UTC,"I'd put my baby in the crib where my toddler couldn't get to him, and I'd bring the toddler with me into the bathroom. We also had strategically placed baby gates. Especially when the infant's skull is soft, you have to be pretty vigilant. My kids are exactly 2 years apart and at 25-26 months, toddlers are big into 'cause' and 'effect'. Some toddlers not so much, but when you have one that wants to see what will happen...the last thing you need is them sitting on the baby's head. Yup, that happens too."
Parenting,3dyksp,albeaner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:50:33 2015 UTC,"Mine was 33 months when the baby came and we used a lot of incremental steps. Here, hold the baby on the floor while I go grab XYZ from the table where I can still see you, etc. Once she hit her 3 year old birthday I was able to leave them alone together for brief periods. She's the oldest in a large group and takes a lot of responsibility. There's a huge cognitive development difference between 25/26 and 33 though, I will agree there. And as I said an earlier post she actually did bite the baby once ""just to see what would happen"". She asked me about it the other day (I didn't think she remembered). ""Remember that time I thought the baby was food and bit her?""  On the whole though she's more likely to damage the baby hugging her to death than through actual violence. I've had to talk her down from a few extreme hugs now and again. I do think you can work up to the point where a 25/26 month old (the right 25/26 month old) can be taught to watch their brother/sister for 30 seconds while you go grab something out of the oven. Giving kids specific responsibility often lets them rise to it.   ""Watch your sister for a minute while I go grab a new roll of toilet paper from downstairs.""  5 seconds later  ""DADDY!!!! The baby is crying!!!""  She's very vigilant when you leave her in charge. It really has to be incremental though as you learn to trust your toddler with the baby. It'd happen over a period of months."
Parenting,3dyksp,Ridry,7,Tue Jul 21 12:44:33 2015 UTC,"It's not her fault. She's not developmentally there yet with the empathy.   Only thing you can do is keep a close eye out. When the inevitable happens, ignore her and heap attention on the baby.  That helped with our then two year old."
Parenting,3dyksp,tanman1975,2,Mon Jul 20 17:51:28 2015 UTC,Thanks! This is all really helpful advice
Parenting,3dyksp,wtadams,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:15:32 2015 UTC,"When it happens, immediately pick the baby up and turn and walk away from the 2 yo.  Don't speak to the 2 yo or give the 2 yo any face time, don't get emotional.  Stay away for at least 2 minutes.  This is called planned ignoring.  You can try being subtle about it, but do it as an immediate reaction.  You can discuss it with her later, explain about how it's bad, ask her to apologize, but do not do this as an immediate response because all that attention is likely to reinforce the bad behavior.  And it's typically better to talk a lot with your kids about why good behavior is good as a reaction to good behavior, teach ethics that way, it takes some practice, thought, and preparation because talking about the good does not come naturally.  Also, give the 2 yo lots of positive feedback for being kind to the baby and helpful with the baby.  Catch her doing good.  Ask her to do small tasks like fetch a diaper or wipes and when she does it thank her with enthusiasm for being helpful.  She may not actually be that helpful, but this prompting, cooperation, thanking cycle is a good learning process for her.  Encouraging gentile touch and reinforcing it with positive attention can be good too.  Do this consistently for 2 weeks, and note the rate vs time of unwanted incidents.  You should see a big improvement.  You can also put the 2 yo in her crib for 2 minutes.  Again no talking or face-time, or at most say ""no hitting"".  But planned ignoring it typically a better approach."

Parenting,3dyksp,gddess,18,Mon Jul 20 17:05:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, hitting a child for hitting a child, that makes great logic."
Parenting,3dyksp,kynanny,7,Mon Jul 20 17:31:51 2015 UTC,Spanking a child will only teach the child to fear authority and to use violence against violence. Doesn't actually teach the child why hitting the sibling is a behavior we don't want to use.
Parenting,3dyksp,MadTrini,-14,Mon Jul 20 17:27:29 2015 UTC,And I suppose your grandparents were all monsters. And a light tap on the bum is violence. No wonder children are so soft and pussified now and need to be pumped full of drugs to be able to sit quietly and pay attention in class. Well done.
