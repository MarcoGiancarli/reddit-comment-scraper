quotes,3e0ejn,FlapjackHatRack,4,Tue Jul 21 01:53:28 2015 UTC,"I love Lao Tzu, but isn't that a bit teleological? Nature doesn't have goals or accomplishments. It just is.

quotes,3e0ejn,Sabblesbox,4,Tue Jul 21 04:54:39 2015 UTC,"I'm looking for an interpretation or some clarification on this saying.   While thinking for a few minutes myself, I ask, does taking care of the minutes equate to living in the present which will somehow allow you to live longer (I imagine by making you happier?)?"

quotes,3e0ejn,rand_guy,4,Tue Jul 21 17:46:38 2015 UTC,I take it as I shouldn't stress over whether long term plans work out or the key to a good life is to live in the moment.

quotes,3e1zug,Yuvrajsinh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:58:50 2015 UTC,"The thing that differentiates good business leaders is their ability to walk away from bad ideas both before and after whatever endeavor has been started.  Getting bogged down in losing situations is a great way to ruin your whole business.  The truth in the perspective rests on the acceptance that a lot of the ideas and opportunities presented in business are bad.  This is true, and differentiating and saying no are how you lead and win."

quotes,3dzcnq,Polaritical,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:06:15 2015 UTC,"The narrator of the book is, arguably, the soul of the ""protagonist"" and he experiences the main character's entire life in reverse, from beginning to end. Ultimately, you see everyday things in a fresh light, and you are left with images of people looking backward when they drive, or of humanity waging war in an attempt to create life.    And you're left with quotes like this:   “It’s all strange to me. I know I live on a fierce and magical planet, which sheds or surrenders rain or even flings it off in whipstroke after whipstroke, which fires out bolts of electric gold into the firmament at 186,000 miles per second, which with a single shrug of its tectonic plates can erect a city in half an hour. Creation … is easy, is quick. There’s also a universe, apparently. But I cannot bear to see the stars, even though I know they’re there all right, and I do see them, because Tod looks upward at night, as everybody does, and coos and points. The Plough. Sirius, the dog. The stars, to me, are like pins and needles, are like the routemap of a nightmare. Don’t join the dots.… Of the stars, one alone can I contemplate without pain. And that’s a planet. The planet they call the evening star, the morning star. Intense Venus.”     And     “He turns the pages from right to left. He begins at the beginning and ends at the end. This makes a quirky sense to me—but Mikio and I are definitely in the minority here. And how can we two be right? It would make so many others wrong. Water moves upward. It seeks the highest level. What did you expect? Smoke falls. Things are created in the violence of fire. But that’s all right. Gravity still pins us to the planet.”     And     ""There was, among my colleagues there, a general though desultory quest for greater elegance. I can understand that word, and all its yearning: elegant. Not for its elegance did I come to love the evening sky above the Vistula, hellish red with the gathering souls. Creation is easy. Also ugly. Hier ist kein warum. Here there is no why. Here there is no when, no how, no where. Our preternatural purpose? To dream a race. To make a people from the weather. From thunder and from lightning. With gas, with electricity, with shit, with fire.""     Read it."
