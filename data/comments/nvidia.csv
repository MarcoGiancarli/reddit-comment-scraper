nvidia,3e31c1,Zintoatree,8,Tue Jul 21 15:59:59 2015 UTC,Nice work putting this together.  It's really interesting to see how much value you can get out of the 290 around that $185-200 price point.  What were your temps like for the 290 when you overclocked it? I've seen some get 90+.
nvidia,3e31c1,cousineddie58,4,Tue Jul 21 16:16:59 2015 UTC,The 290 really is a good value if you can grab one used. Around 85 on the Core and 100ish on the VRM. I had to have my fans running full blast while overclocked that much.
nvidia,3e31c1,cousineddie58,4,Tue Jul 21 16:20:06 2015 UTC,Not too bad all things considered. I'd be interesting to see how it does with a nice aftermarket cooler or waterblock.
nvidia,3e31c1,Probate_Judge,3,Tue Jul 21 16:36:45 2015 UTC,The Tri-X cooler is pretty good. I think you would have to go water cooling.  It works perfectly fine and might even be considered a bonus in winter times.
nvidia,3e31c1,Probate_Judge,5,Tue Jul 21 16:39:40 2015 UTC,"I know this really isn't the best test seeing as Pcars and WoW lean quite a bit to the Green team, but I was curious and figured someone might want to see it.   A lot of people don't admit that when it lies in their favor.  A couple of runaway outliers really throw off an average and can be misleading.  This is part of what is known as ""lying with statistics"" when people insist that such an all-encompassing number would be a good rule that is applicable to everyone.  Very large props for including a disclaimer with that piece of data.  A lot of reviewers do not and why I call a lot of them bias.  You often do not see that kind of awareness on reddit hardware subs.   You can find the 290 for around $200 while the 970 is usually around $50+ more.   At new prices you can get 290/290x cheaper than 970's as well, though the prices have spiked some since the 3xx release, though the 2xx are seeming to come back down and go on sale more often.  As even nvidia leaning reviewers state, the 970 is NOT budging in price at all aside from small short lived merchant level sales.  I got a new xfx 290x DD black edition for $305 recently on amazon(I had gift cards that brought it down to ~240), and newegg commonly has sales placing similar cards(Sapphire) in the ~$275 range. As where all the better 970's tend to ride mid-300(all USD pricing) which is why even the 390 is attractive to many.  [the 2xx xfx isn't really that bad of a cooler, the fans by default are just set incredibly low, something like 45% max]  Anyways...I was going to say, that is an awfully cheap 970!, had to have been a helluva sale....and only later saw it was bstock, because of course I skipped straight to the benchmarks!  : P   Still, whatever works.  I don't read much of nvidia(a lot of tech support stuff it seems, a lul in the new-release hype and tech-news that I'm interested in) but this popped up on my front page, and it was an interesting read.  Wish I could upvote more : )"
nvidia,3e31c1,Probate_Judge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:52 2015 UTC,"I was originally planning on testing out Far Cry 4 but I ended up changing my mind because I was getting a little burnt out with all the benchmarks. If I would have I might have left the disclaimer out because it would more than likely have evened it up.   When it comes to what card to choose, it is kind of tough to answer. When I bought my 290 I got it for 239 after MIR. A week after that it was $30-$40 more expensive. The prices shift so much in the world of PC parts, that it basically comes down to grabbing the lowest priced part, at that time, that will work for your intended uses. Some people only see Red and Green so their choices gets narrowed drastically and they might be losing out.  One of the main reason's I wanted to do this comparison was because I didn't see very many reviews that pitted Aftermarket cards vs other aftermarket cards, let alone OC'ed vs OC'ed. But after testing I realized that both cards are fantastic cards and both have strengths the other one does not. I would recommend either one to someone looking, it all would depend on price."
nvidia,3e31c1,Emophia,2,Tue Jul 21 18:57:15 2015 UTC,"Aftermarket cards vs other aftermarket cards   Heh, I mentioned that in the /amd thread, lol. That's where I spend more time, with the newer card as well as my recent purchase(as well as something I've typed below, you'll see why it's a better fit).  They sometimes don't outright say it's a reference card(s), they just say ""GTX 970""  so was it reference, or was it MSI or some other?  I saw one review for the AMD 3xx cards where that was the descriptor, something like ""Radeon 390x"" in the benchmark lists, but there wasn't a reference card, and the MSI 390x one was the one being reviewed and had its own separate entry in the bar chart....WTF?  I find more and more problems with ""professional"" reviewers that piss me off any more.  Lack of transparency / adequate information for the reader is certainly one of them.  When it comes to what card to choose, it is kind of tough to answer.  Not for me, but I may be in the wrong sub to say something about Nvidia's business practices, I don't want to pick a fight. : P  When giving advice to others though, I tell people to not listen to others.  More often than not that leaves the buyer sitting around going, ""Why did I listen to that idiot?""  I'm all for people obtaining to as much information and making the best decision for themselves instead of just going on the direction of someone else.  That's why people like you who do a good run of benchmarks are great.  It's those individual game performances that should influence choices the most after what the buyer can afford.  Who cares how Pcars performs if you're never going to play it?  That is why averages are bad things to base decisions off of after all.  Anyhow, thanks again, even though I don't need it, it is good to know and something to point to for people who want that info.  I'll be saving the thread for that purpose."

nvidia,3e5ad3,SzyjeCzapki,4,Wed Jul 22 01:48:08 2015 UTC,"That old powerpoint slide that claimed Pascal had ""10x the performance"" of Maxwell was referring exclusively to the HBM 2.0 memory. Pascal will (supposedly) use HBM 2.0 instead of the current GDDR5 standard, which is capable of ""up to"" 10x faster data transfer speeds.   Thing is, memory is far from the only thing that matters in cards. Sure it matters, but as we've seen with the Fury X, a card needs more than fast memory to be leaps and bounds ahead of its competition. As for the size of the chip, the smaller the die size and the individual transistors are, the less power required. A 14nm chip would require less power draw than a 20nm for example, which leads to lower temperatures and better efficiency. Who knows if Pascal will be 14nm though...manufacturers have been having trouble getting defect-free chips at that size.   Basically, faster memory is nice, but unless the actual chip is a miracle chip, it'll be just another ~15-25% performance upgrade cycle. Until we have more info, it's all speculation anyway."
nvidia,3e5ad3,Reddit_Is_So_Bad,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:57:17 2015 UTC,"So it's been rumored above that Nvidia will tap out its chips on the 16nm technology, which, while bigger, is a significant step up from the 28nm tech we see in Maxwell. Practically speaking, this should sum it up well.    TSMCâ€™s 16FF+ (FinFET Plus) technology can provide above 65 percent higher speed, around 2 times the density, or 70 percent less power than its 28HPM technology. Comparing with 20SoC technology, 16FF+ provides extra 40% higher speed and 60% power saving.    So, basically, it's a whole lot faster, and uses less power (less HEAT!!!) to do the same amount of calculations as you would need on a 28nm chip. And since it's double the density, basically, you can get double the power/performance for the same size chip and same heat/power output."

I'll tell you my experience with the ones I've tested:  -Batman Arkham asylum: Everytime I walked into paper stacks or objects on the ground, the game would often stutter for a split second before going back to 60 fps. The scarecrow sequences that used physx more heavily, brought the FPS down to single digit, in a 2009 game ran on what was the top single gpu card at the time.  -Arkham Origins: Fps drop from 60 when there was lots of smoke, the worst offender though was the deadshot fight, FPS was stable in the low 20ies there.  -Assassin's creed 4: No, just no.  So at least until last gen of nvidia cards, a dedicated physx card would have provided significant benefits."
nvidia,3e3cnr,miningdroid,3,Tue Jul 21 20:54:51 2015 UTC,"Ok as I'm an inpatient man I ended up contacting nVidia's chat support about it, and got fantastic support, thanks Sonal!  TL:DR    Yes it works as long as both cards are supported by the same drivers.  It won't drain performance form the main card. The secondary card will be able to help with PhysX, if set to do so, and thus might increase performance of the main card.   Here is the answers I got, for anyone that is interested:  Name changed for obvious reasons  Sonal: Hi, my name is Sonal. How may I help you?   rB0rlax: Hi   Sonal: Hello rB0rlax   rB0rlax: I currently use a GTX 980 TI and wonder if I would be able to use it together with an older nvidia card so I can use more than 4 monitors? Not using SLI obviously.   rB0rlax: I have a GTX 260 laying around and if that one is to old? I only intend to use the extra monitors for non-3d stuff   rB0rlax: I really need some extra space but don't feel like getting another 980 TI just for adding more monitors, that won't be used for games anyway.  Sonal: Please give me a moment, let me check   rB0rlax: Thank you   Sonal: Thank you for your patience rB0rlax   Sonal: GTX 260 is an older card as compared to GTX 980ti. In order to use both the cards in the same PC, you need to have a driver which is supported for both the cards, the latest driver for GTX 260 is 341.44 version which is not supported for GTX 980ti. So unfortunately, both the cards cannot work together.   Sonal: You can get any other midrange card like GT 620, Gt 720 etc in order to run two more monitors and you can use it along with GTX 980ti   rB0rlax: I see. I thought that might be the case   rB0rlax: How long will a 600-series card be compatible with latest drivers for a 980 TI? So I don't end up with not being able to update drivers later on because the older card gets dropped   Sonal: The 600-700 series is a newer series. The GTX 980ti can be used along with the cards from 400 series and above. So its good if you get 700 series because its a new series , it will be lasting longer.   rB0rlax: Ok, is there any roadmap for when support for the different series will be dropped? Just so I have an idea of how long they will both work with the latest drivers   Sonal: Unfortunately we do not have any such roadmap. It depends on the manufacturers what card they will release , but I am sure, 700 series is going to last longer as its a new series   rB0rlax: ok thank you!   Sonal: No problem rB0rlax   rB0rlax: So there is no performance loss for the main card (the 980 TI) when using together with an older card? It will run as it did without it?   rB0rlax: just want to make sure so I won't take performance from the 980 TI   Sonal: It depends which monitor is connected to which GPU. If the monitor that you will be gaming on is connected to GTX 980ti, the performance will remain intact   rB0rlax: great! thank you   Sonal: :)   rB0rlax: One last question if you don't mind? Let's say I get a 750 as secondary card, would the 750 be able to give a significant performance gain if I let it help the main card with PhysX?   Sonal: Certainly rB0rlax, if you set the other GPU for physx, the load from GTX 980 ti will get transferred to the physx GPU and the performance will get enhanced.   rB0rlax: Great :) I'm surprised so few have written about this online. I could hardly find any information at all when searching around.   rB0rlax: Thank you for everything Sonal! You've been really helpful :)   Sonal: My pleasure rB0rlax :)   Sonal: Is there anything else I can help you with today?   rB0rlax: If there is any way to rate the support, please let me know and I'll give a great rating   rB0rlax: Nothing else, thank you!   Sonal: Thank you so much :)"

My only complaint about the kit is the radiator fan that came with it is a little bit loud and is a 2 pin fan, so its just always blowing. It's honestly not even that loud, I'm just a quiet freak. To fix this, I ordered a Noctua static pressure fan and I'm going to connect it to my mobo, and just set up a custom fan curve there. I'll let you know if that does the trick if you're interested.

nvidia,3e4s7w,Zarknox,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:51:35 2015 UTC,The choice is do you want a card with a reference PCB or a aftermarket? Do you plan on OCing? My G1's boost to 1342 with no additional OCing and default power target.  I'll be water cooling as soon as EK has a block so I wanted something with 2 8pin.  Also in stock...no need to wait. http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1160257-REG/gigabyte_gv_n98tg1_gaming_6gd_geforce_gtx_980_ti.html  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125787&nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-na-_-na-_-na&cm_sp=&AID=10446076&PID=6202798&SID=

nvidia,3e3j95,sven784230,2,Tue Jul 21 18:02:14 2015 UTC,Normally it should be like 50 at most since the fans turn off. Is your ambient really hot or bad airflow in the case?
nvidia,3e3j95,hdshatter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, ambient temp is pretty high right now (it has 34 degrees outside......)"
nvidia,3e3j95,scarecrowman175,2,Tue Jul 21 18:15:26 2015 UTC,Do you have any sort of AC in your room? If it's the same temperature outside as it is in your room then that'll of course lead to higher temperatures. What are your temps at load? Ideally you want your GPU to idle anywhere below 50c so 60c at idle is pretty warm. I had the same model 970 in my build and it idled at about 30c in my 20c room.
nvidia,3e3j95,tekwarfare,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:27:11 2015 UTC,it goes up to ~79 degrees under load.. i have no AC sadly  I'll probably mount an intake fan on the side of my case.  Thats my OC btw: http://imgur.com/J8PIqlM
nvidia,3e3j95,scarecrowman175,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:25 2015 UTC,I've disconnected all case fans and shoved my tower under my bed. My temps idle between 50 and 60Â°C. My load temps are 80Â°C tops. You can use MSI Afterburner to set the fans to turn on at 70Â°C if you want.
nvidia,3e3j95,scarecrowman175,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:38 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend setting a custom fan profile for your 970 so the fans run earlier to try and keep temps. down a bit. I'd also recommend you get an AC, fan, or something to try to cool your room down as that'd greatly help the cooling of your PC and yourself. You're not exactly at risk of frying your GPU with those temps (I believe the 970 is safe up to 98c) but it will shorten the life span if those high temps stay consistent throughout its lifespan. Which, by the time it gets worn down by those temps it'd be 5 years from now in which case newer and better cards will be out."
nvidia,3e3j95,RainbowTurt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:46:10 2015 UTC,sooo... i guess there is no reason for custom fan curves?  It's pretty annoying/time consuming to always start Afterburner with Windows

Most people who have cooler ambient temperatures won't ever need to use them, but people in your situation can benefit from them. As for it being annoying to start up afterburner, you can get it to start up at launch. Just add it to the Start Menu > All Programs > Startup directory if you have Win 7."

Coil whine is also a mixed bag, so just know no matter the option you choose - there's always the chance you get that.  That being said, I'm definitely one of the G1 owners who think the card is pretty quiet even under a 75% fan load. In idle, I can't even hear it over my normal fans, and with the 75% it blows my previous Gigabyte 290x out of the water in terms of silence.  When I was doing the research myself I saw a general consensus of the MSI being great for the gamer - offering silence and performance, while the Gigabyte was for those wanting to squeeze a little more out of their OCs (which, in the grand scheme of things is very, very small and luck-of-the-draw compared to the MSI - which already has great OC capability). Other than that, people love EVGA for their warranty services and Step-Up Program.   You'd be happy with any choice really, it's just the little perks that make the decision for many.

nvidia,3e070o,RenegadeXG,26,Mon Jul 20 23:10:36 2015 UTC,Considering how rabid the target audience for these cards are to have the highest ASIC score possible... it's fantastic marketing.   They'll be sold out in minutes.
nvidia,3e070o,Munkypoo7,3,Mon Jul 20 23:22:39 2015 UTC,Yeah i woulda opted in for higher bin too. I got a 71% asic card and it has just an avg OC ability. I might end up flipping it for $50/$75 loss to go bleeding edge with one that's higher than 80%.  Those seem to be hitting 1500+ easily.  So random though i still dont know. Im on the fence.  I've had an MSI 970 that was a 78 and it was solid and I had an EVGA 980 SC  ACX 2.0 that was a 69 and it acted just like this card but with a BIOS flash it was fine once the voltages were stabilized.  The problem with the TI's and Titan X's is even with a BIOS flash unless you get into LN2 temperatures you cant get around the vdrops and these chips dont respond to more voltage as well as the GM204 chips.
nvidia,3e070o,p3dr0maz,2,Mon Jul 20 23:29:11 2015 UTC,My 2 GTX 980's are 65 and 67 percent. Both have clocked over 1500. Hell at stock voltage I set it to +250 core and +450 on memory. Boost 2.0 took them to 1505 right out the gate. Asic score I feel doesn't have a whole lot to do with over clocking in these cards.

Just look at the low egg/star reviews people would leave for a perfectly functioning card that just didn't OC ""enough"". It's uninformed whining and outrage.  Well, now the GPU manufacturer is looking at this number instead of leaving it to the lottery, which means increased overhead and justification to enlarge their profit margins. Congratulations! Maybe this will stay within Kingpin sales, maybe within EVGA. Or maybe it'll spread like a virus to the other brands and people will finally settle for lower ASIC scores like they should've in the first place."

nvidia,3e070o,Salt_Lake,3,Tue Jul 21 13:06:56 2015 UTC,"basically, there are... qualities to a card, like with a CPU and the K series CPU are higher quality, and as a result they are unlocked. you can make 1500 sheets of CPUs but only about 150 CPUs off those sheets are top tier where others might have bad cores and as a result be sold as duals or triples rather than quads, or would be slowed down and move to laptop CPUs well, the imperfections affect the quality and there for ""the binning"". This is basically, for the first time ever, assuring you get the quality/bin you want.    its less of a gamble this way, there are people who will buy 4 or mroe to get a high tier bin then sell the spares because a better bin means less imperfections and as a result you would have less heat leaking and better voltage response, so in theory, a better overclock. However, the issue is still a gamble, though less so. Now you are gambling that the few imperfections that the chip has are not in a vital location. so you know LESS imperfections, but still dont know the locations that they are located. you could have a 75+ bin, and it still have a critical imperfection that limits you past a certain point, but a 70 might have more imperfections (hence the lower score) but they might be in less vital locations and as a result that chip still could overclock better than the 75"

They had kingpin cards at whatever event before the launch of the 980ti so they've been building/binning them for a while. With this one your paying extra for the guarantee of a better binned chip but you can still get lucky on the siliocon lottery.  It all makes sense. The only reason you should be getting this card is for L2N, otherwise your paying $300 extra for maybe 50mhz over what a G1 or classified can do which is gonna make the card 1-2% faster over other oc'd cards. From what I can tell, the pricing for the Kingpin cards is either for A) l2N OCers who need the extra headroom because apparently Maxwell operates differently than older cards and higher binning looks like its always better or B) idiots. For both of those target markets the up charge seems reasonable."

nvidia,3e070o,RiffyDivine2,2,Tue Jul 21 13:05:55 2015 UTC,"I did some original research with regard to ASIC, basically, besides all the known stuff, for every ~5% higher or lower quality than about 70%, the 980 tis / titans with dynamically clock about 1 tick higher or lower usually (but no more than 2). 1 tick on this architecture is 13 mhz. Also, for all 980 tis / titans, the dynamic boost clock is 214 mhz over stock clock speed, for an ASIC of ~70%. So, if you were to buy an ASIC 72% 980ti Kingpin, your max dynamic clock will be 1203 mhz+214 mhz=1417 mhz, probably. If you were to get an 80% one, you can expect a max dynamic clock of 1203 mhz + 214 mhz + 26/39 mhz = 1443mhz/1456mhz. So, if you are okay with paying 200 bucks more for a 2-3% faster card, go for it, if not, don't waste your money. Note, this does not take into consideration things like the GPU hitting power/temp/other limits..."
nvidia,3e070o,Merpmerp1618,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:16:40 2015 UTC,I would like to see how many extra fps this translates to in a game like Witcher 3.
nvidia,3e070o,wanderjahr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:54:43 2015 UTC,I kinda half ass tested this when overclocking my 980ti. Just loaded a couple save games with and without oc in witcher 3 and saw about 15 fps difference stock vs +250 mhz. So about 1 fps for every 17 mhz I guess based on my thoroughly unscientific testing.

nvidia,3e070o,drummerdude41,2,Tue Jul 21 13:06:36 2015 UTC,I never got the point of this ASIC crap. I've had cards with 80+ ASIC score that OC'ed worse than cards with 70+ ASIC.

nvidia,3e070o,qazme,5,Mon Jul 20 23:32:57 2015 UTC,"I mean, the way I understand it anyways, behind it is lower ASIC has the same chance of overclock except you may have to put more voltage on it. To someone under water this means nadda. To someone on air it could be the difference between a stable 1500mhz and a stable 1470mhz. Whew HUGE difference. /sarcasm  Is that really worth an additional $200? This is my laugh.....the crying comes in when people start bragging about paying extra for it and how they have a 80% ASIC and talk about it like it's a big deal. This reminds me of the days when they first started introducing the SC cards.  Now there will be questions popping up - ""hey guys should I get the ASIC 80% SC or the ASIC 70% SSC? Which one will be faster they are both the same price?"".....UGH - laughable and crying at the same time. :-/"
nvidia,3e070o,p3dr0maz,3,Mon Jul 20 23:36:38 2015 UTC,I tried more volts on my maxwell TI and it didnt really make a diff. If anything it was more unstable.  Mid range voltage was the sweet spot.  What i have noticed from other forum members is that the higher ASIC's seem to be way more reliable with the power delivery and experience less voltage drops on temps than some others with a lower score (for example a higher binned GPU on the OC thread  upvolted to 1.230V vs my lower 1.224V on the same BIOS).  So more reliable power means stabler /higher OC's.  My voltage goes like this:  1.224 < 45c  1.205 < 55c  1.187 < 65c  so between those three voltages i fluctuate from 1468.6Mhz to 1455.5Mhz to 1442Mhz.  I can lock my voltage at 1.255 and ill be floating on the edge of stability at 1481Mhz. Most games it's fine but some of the more intense games it will artifact eventually.  This is on AIO water so i rarely pass 55c but before I was passing 75c on air so with the Vdrop hit being worse I experienced drops down to around 1400Mhz.
nvidia,3e070o,kittah,2,Mon Jul 20 23:47:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, apparently Maxwell is an oddball in that it doesn't really respond well to increased voltage except at sub ambient (0C and colder) temps. In the past it was always more V = more clock with the ability to dissipate heat being the limiting factor. This is why you could always OC higher under water than on air.  However it appears with maxwell that you will typically hit your highest stable air/water clock at stock voltage. To benefit from increasing V you need phase change cooling or LN2.  Can read more about it from Kinpin's statement here: http://kingpincooling.com/forum/showpost.php?p=30273&postcount=57  My reference 980 Ti w/ ACX cooler is stable at 1480 Mhz at the stock 1.18V. It will pass firstrike at 1520Mhz and some games at 1502 but 1480Mhz is rock solid for daily use, about 100 hrs in witcher 3 with 0 crashes. This is with 75.4% asic quality."
nvidia,3e070o,p3dr0maz,2,Mon Jul 20 23:54:01 2015 UTC,Ok that read is good. thx man. gonna share it over at oc.net  That explains why my best clocks are right around 1.255V
nvidia,3e070o,RiffyDivine2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:17:01 2015 UTC,A bit off topic but is there any truth to leaving cards overvolted for normal use will damage them or wear out faster?
nvidia,3e070o,kittah,2,Tue Jul 21 00:25:31 2015 UTC,It is true that increasing voltage speeds up the process of electromigration but the minor amount of overvolting you can do with a stock bios is not going to have an appreciable effect.   The card will be obsolete long before this effect kills it. Pretty hard to kill a card these days with the thermal & voltage limits baked in.
nvidia,3e070o,RiffyDivine2,2,Tue Jul 21 13:25:55 2015 UTC,Thank you. I wasn't sure just how massive maxing the overvolt slider in X really was since it visually looks like a lot. I did move each power connector to it's own spot on the PSU I got so one line for each power connector. Thought it may help.
nvidia,3e070o,p3dr0maz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:45 2015 UTC,I mean yes but probably not in any significant or noticeable amount as long as your temps are fine. In general the extra voltage isn't what shortens the life it's the extra heat. As long as your temps are under control it should be negligible.
nvidia,3e070o,RiffyDivine2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:34:16 2015 UTC,I got my 980s on hybrid coolers so they are 45c under max load well overclocked pretty hard. But I kept being told if I leave them that overclocked the card was going to die which didn't make sense unless I blew a cap on it or something.
nvidia,3e070o,p3dr0maz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:31:19 2015 UTC,Overvolted  and overclocked are not the same thing  and you just used the term interchangeably.  Are you OV or OC'd or both?  Either way if your temps are that low it really shouldn't matter IMO.
nvidia,3e070o,RiffyDivine2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:09:25 2015 UTC,"Both and yes I did and didn't catch myself, sorry. I overclocked the card and was impressed before it began to crash if I pushed it more and was told to overvolt the card to fix that which it did. Currently when I play a game that can be demanding like the witcher 3 at max I will both overclock and overvolt the card for three or four hours at a time."
nvidia,3e070o,p3dr0maz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:14:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah Witcher 3 if you read around is kinda a pita.

Maxwell is a bit odd when it comes to overclocking in that it doesn't really respond well to increasing voltage at ambient temps unlike previous generations. In the past it was always more voltage = more clock speed with ability to dissipate heat being the limiting factor which is why historically you could hit higher overclocks under water than on air.  With maxwell to see benefit from overvolting you need to be at sub ambient temps (0C or colder) so you don't really see a whole lot of benefit of a custom PCB with extra voltage & power phases unless you are using phase change cooling or LN2.

nvidia,3e3ks2,Syn246,2,Tue Jul 21 20:00:12 2015 UTC,"If that is your total score, please also post your graphics and physics scores (smaller numbers below the total after the benchmark run).  The 3dmark total score is not good for comparing your graphics performance relative to others because it includes the physics test which is 100% CPU-bound.

nvidia,3e3ks2,andrew5161,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:57 2015 UTC,"There is nearly no difference in 3d mark score for 4690k vs 4790k btw, its less than 500."
nvidia,3e3ks2,Syn246,2,Tue Jul 21 19:25:00 2015 UTC,"This is true for the graphics-only score, but not the total score. A given i5 will score substantially lower on the physics test than its i7 counterpart with Hyperthreading enabled, assuming all other things are equal such as clock speeds.  A 4690k will usually score somewhere in the 8-9k range on the physics test while the 4790k will score more like 13k+. This does manifest itself in the total score as well, even if the two machines' graphics scores are the same."
nvidia,3e3ks2,andrew5161,0,Tue Jul 21 19:50:03 2015 UTC,"That is not really true. My friends 5820k and my 4690k (both with large overclocks) only score about 2000 diff in total score, a 5820k is a much more powerful chip than a 4790k so the difference has to be even less than those two when comparing a 4790k to a 4690k. And the graphics score is not effected by your cpu except a tiny bit in the combined test score."
nvidia,3e3ks2,Syn246,2,Tue Jul 21 20:35:17 2015 UTC,"This is simply incorrect and it's misleading to others who are reading it. The total score is a function of both the graphics and physics scores. The physics score is directly related to the number of threads on the CPU. If you have the exact same GPU setup but different CPU thread count between two PCs, the machine with more threads will score higher both on the physics score and the total score (assuming all else is equal between the systems). The perceived degree or severity of the score discrepancy is subjective--the quantitative result is that one scores higher than the other every time. Thus, comparing graphics score to graphics score is the most valid choice when attempting to determine how your video card(s) are performing relative to others."

Also there is no direct relationship between the number off cores and the score for physics, so even suggest that is plainly ignorant. If this was even remotely true, why does a 8350 (8 core) score lower than a 4690k (4 core), twice as many cores. ""The physics score is directly related to the number of threads on the CPU."" << Wrong.  To expound further, the combined score in firestrike also effects the overall graphics score, the combined score is derived from cpu + gpu, so unless you have the exact same cpu even then its not a direct comparison between gpus to use the graphics score. You really should learn more about how firestrike works before you try to lecture on it.  ""--the quantitative result is that one scores higher than the other every time. "" Not true at all, a 4790k running at .1 ghz will score lower than a 4690k running at 4.5 ghz.

nvidia,3e3ks2,Syn246,2,Tue Jul 21 22:22:21 2015 UTC,"I'm actually right but you're trying to pick apart my words to turn them into something they're not. I stand by my statement that the physics score is directly related to the number of threads, because your terrible attempt at refuting it is entirely flawed--you are trying to compare an 8-thread AMD that's got a totally different architecture to a 4-thread Intel chip. It is improtant to note that I never said that core count is the only function of physics scoring in 3dmark. To support my prior statement which implies that all else is equal besides core count between two given CPUs, you should compare a Haswell i5 to its Haswell i7 counterpart, or Ivybridge i5 to Ivybridge i7, or Sandybridge i5 to Sandybridge i7, etc. You will see that two chips with the same architecture and clock speeds will generate vastly different 3dmark physics scores (and thus total scores) due to the core count difference between the two. Sure, there are other factors as well, but the thread count is by far the most impactful.  All I am saying is that quite simply, the ""total score"" in 3dmark--a.k.a. the giant orange one at the top that many people mistakenly post without also including the detailed graphics-only and physics-only scores--is tied directly to both the graphics and the physics scores. It would be invalid to surmise that a given i5 machine's graphics performance is significantly worse than the same machine with an i7 due to looking only at the two total scores.  Here's another example to add to the person who replied earlier. Before I post the details, this is not a perfect example because the machines are not identical and the CPUs are clocked differently, however the graphics scores are almost exactly the same while the physics scores are roughly 50% apart (which is typical for a 4-thread i5 vs. an 8-thread i7) and you can see that the total score is also different. This is all I'm saying--don't compare total score to total score when trying to determine graphics performance between machines with vastly different CPUs.   4690k: http://www.3dmark.com/fs/5324346 4790k: http://www.3dmark.com/fs/5459409 Graphics score difference: 0.1% (39799 vs 39850) -- nearly identical Physics score difference: 51.3% (8967 vs 13564) Total score difference: 14.3% (21119 vs 24139)"

nvidia,3e3ks2,Syn246,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:48:50 2015 UTC,"So again for whatever reason you are trying to run away with your own fabricated argument. I never said thread count was the only factor in physics scoring. I wholly agree that there are other factors in play--of course there are! Thread count is just the primary driver of the discrepancy.  My point is simply to not compare 3dmark total scores between two machines with vastly different CPUs, otherwise you'll go mad if you're on the shorter end of the CPU stick.   You can set # of cores/threads aside entirely--if any two 3dmark results' graphics scores are identical but their physics scores differ by a significant percentage (i.e. 30% or more), the total scores will also be skewed in favor of the machine scoring significantly higher on the physics portion. Period.  If you disagree with this point, find me a pair of validated Fire Strike results where their graphics scores are within 1%, physics scores are 50% apart or more, AND their total scores are also still within 1% (or hell even 2%). It's not going to happen, and this is my entire point.

Using the Advanced Search feature on the 3dmark site, it appears most 4690k & single 980 Ti users are scoring a total score in the 15000+ range, but their physics scores are more in the 9000 neighborhood or ~30% higher than yours.

However this 980 FTW was having problems where it would randomly blackscreen and lock up the pc so that reset was the only thing to do.  When I went to the forum I found that the issue was fairly common and there was at least 8 or 9 people that were complaining about this. To add to the mistery, the card would work absolutely fine in firestrike extreme and could loop it as long as you wanted, however it could not finish a run of skydiver. It became apparent that voltage fluctuations were crashing the card as somehow if you ran with DSR enabled, that would stop the crashes.  Couple of days later in the thread chimes in not a forum mod, not some EVGA PR guy, but the product manager who made the card in the first place, he communicated directly with us and quickly they found out there was indeed an issue that affected quite some 980 FTWs. Once they identified it, it took them less than two weeks to deploy a fix.   Meanwhile, they were offering free returns to people affected and, I returned myself my card just to get another one with the same issue, I held onto this one though as the fix was being developed and once the fix was out, I sent it back one last time (still for free) and got another fixed 980 FTW back that is problems free.  That's a prime example of how customer support should be done, there was a problem with the card and rather than running circles around you the company investigated, ADMITTED the issue and fixed the problem quickly.   In the end everyone makes a mistake, what matters is how you own up to it and no one does that better than EVGA.  Yes this post is awfully pro EVGA, but they worked so hard on this and so quick that they deserve to have praises sung, they set an example for every other video card maker out there."

Is it when the manufacturer picks the best chips and bins the 'bad' ones? So you end up with top grade chips, each one being slightly different?"
nvidia,3e136m,PorkAmbassador,3,Tue Jul 21 13:46:21 2015 UTC,"That's not binning. Binning is a process that happens after the manufacturing is done and its what gpu manufacturers uses to estabilish what will become of the chips. Let's say they just got done producing some GM 200, they will be checked for defects. Some will be perfect and have everything working and match the specification of a full GM200 GPU. Those will end up into Titan X cards. Some might have some slight defects, let's say rather than having all 24 SMM working, some have only 23. What nvidia does in this case is to disable another one and those chips will become 980Ti.  The downside to this is that any chip that comes out with less than 22SMM working, will have to be trashed as nvidia didn't create a product that uses a further reduced version of the GM200, which could partly explain the high costs.  What you are referring to (picking the best chips) happens when you have already a bunch of chips that you know are either Titan X or 980tis and you specifically select the ones that overclock more, have less leakage. That is called ""cherry-picking"""

nvidia,3e0a0j,Captain_Bear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:49:40 2015 UTC,Mine will say that sometimes in afterburner (it OCs to 1480MHz normally (i have an EVGA SC+ ACX)) l0nk. If it isnt clocking higher in games try turning prefer maximum performance on under manage 3D settings>power management in NVidia control panel.  P.S. if you alt tab out of a fullscreen game it will clock down to a lower speed because it isn't rendering stuff so if you want to see real speeds use windowed/borderless mode and my favorite app for reading GPU things is GPU-Z

nvidia,3e0a0j,Captain_Bear,2,Tue Jul 21 00:17:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, turning the power management to max performance will make it idle around 1100MHz, which will make it run hotter but reach higher clock speeds in games (more fps).

Then turn the power limit slider all the way up and then increase the core clock slider by +25 and +50 on the mem slider and run the benchmark, of it runs without any problems and artifacting (weird colors, flashing textures, black spots) increase it again until it crashes (screen goes black and an error message appears and says the driver stopped and recovered) then turn the core and mem clock down by around -35 and -60 and there you go!

nvidia,3e0xf6,JaketheAlmighty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:59:29 2015 UTC,"It might.  Most people recommend going for core clock over memory clock, I tend to believe a good balance of both is best.  I would monitor your power % when overclocked.  Overclocking GDDR5 can draw a surprising amount of power, this is one reason that lowering the memory clock could help achieve higher core clocks.  I would consider putting memory clocks down to +495 (~8000Mhz effective) and see what you could get from the core, start with something reasonable like 1450MHz and go from there.  For instance, My G1 seems the happiest at 1492MHz core and 8002 Mhz Mem  In MSI afterburner this is:  +87mv 130 power% +100 core +495 mem  I also use a custom fan curve that is a bit more aggressive to keep the gpu under 73 when I am using my overclocked settings."

I wonder if it impacts performance though, because like I said it's a little bit of a catch-22: if I put the stronger (& thus cooler/lower voltage) card in the top slot then it gets detected as GPU2 and does less of the work (again assuming the primary GPU does in fact carry more of the load), but if I put it in the bottom slot to make it GPU1 then the weaker/hotter card is in the top position and will reach its thermal limit sooner...  The main reason I'm so interested in chasing this down is because my cards now seem to be unstable at their old 1506/8000 OC. I've got them down to ~1470/8000 right now. Of course, being that I just changed the motherboard/processor/memory, the cause of the OC instability could be any number of things."

nvidia,3dzv0j,AY099d0h9h0d,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:39:49 2015 UTC,yes it will work. but dont expect to play across all 3 screens. a single 780 can do it but you will have to lower the settings. if you plan on sing the 1440p screen is will work as well but you wont get 144hz on any of the latest screens. i also have a 144hz 1440p screen but i have SLI 780s. and i still dont hit a full 144hz on the latest games.    so long story short...  1920x1200 screens = expect full frames.  1440p screen = you wont hit 144hz on graphic heavy games unless you lower the settings if you want speed over quality.   all 3 screens = expect medium graphic settings  with average 30-60(60 depending on the game)
nvidia,3dzv0j,Vinnyk84,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:06:04 2015 UTC,"I'd expect to only use the one screen @144hz to play the game. With that being said, am I still going to lose frames because the displays are active? In other words, will I need to disconnect the other two screens, or are you talking about the case where somebody would span the game across all three screens?"
nvidia,3dzv0j,kittah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:10:34 2015 UTC,"Nah, no trouble in games at all. I'm just taking about the behavior of the GPU at idle. Instead of downclocking all the way to 135 Mhz it will idle at around 8-900Mhz which will cause higher idle temps than you might be used to.  This is a side effect of the higher pixel clock required to drive a 144hz display or to drive three displays.  Really no big deal just something you might notice and wonder why it's happening."
nvidia,3dzv0j,Vinnyk84,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:20:04 2015 UTC,"if you are using just the 1440p and the others are just gonna be connected, you will maybe lose...1% of the power. its nothing big enough to notice. but a single gtx 780 will be tough to hit 144hz @ 1440p. if you give me some games you plan on playing. i can help you as we pretty much have the same setup except that i have SLI 780s."
nvidia,3dzv0j,fuguemaster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:08:20 2015 UTC,Should be no problem. The GTX 780 supports up to 4 displays. http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-780/features
nvidia,3dzv0j,kittah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:07:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can run 3 monitors off 1 780 no worries.   Just be aware that you will most likely run into the issue of your GPU not downclocking when not in use. Normally at idle GPUs will clock down to ~150Mhz but if you have a single monitor @ 144hz or 3 monitors total it will only clock down to around ~800-900Mhz.  Workaround for single 144hz monitor is to set monitor to 120hz at desktop. However there really isn't a good way to get it to downclock with 3 monitors. You can google about forcing P states through nvidia inspector but it's more trouble than it's worth IMO."

nvidia,3dzq9e,kittah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:45:21 2015 UTC,Just to be clear you installed 353.38 hot fix and not the latest driver available through GeForce experience right?  If so then try 350.12 or 347.88. If you still get crashes on those it's not a driver issue then. If reverting to stock clocks fixes it then it's definitely just too high of an overclock.   Hell I had a pair of superclocked 770s that would artifact and crash with as little as +20 mhz overclock. Current 980 ti can handle +251. So it goes.

To get it to go back to 144hz in games just set the refresh rate option in Nvidia control panel from ""application controlled"" to ""prefer maximum refresh rate"".  Edit: Since I can't read, this can also be caused by high res monitor or 3 screens connected. It has something to do with the pixel clock needed to drive 144hz or multiple displays."

nvidia,3dz2q7,p3dr0maz,2,Mon Jul 20 19:22:50 2015 UTC,You can read all the owner threads over at overclock.net for each version.    As far as silicon lottery its pretty random.  I think the G1 guys are getting better luck though for being able to get 1500 on air w/o throttling voltage cause of temps.  I think the concensus is the G1 fans do keep this chip the coolest.    MSI anecdote: I can get 1468.5Mhz @ 1.224V  but at 45c then 55c the stock BIOS Boost 2.0 downvolts (1.205V/1.186V respectively).   Keeping it under 65c is pretty hard on air. Mine went all the way to the mid 70's on Witcher 3 1440p/Vsync off before i threw a water cooler on (kraken g10) and most run about that hot.  With the water cooler i usually run in the mid 50's.
nvidia,3dz2q7,hdshatter,2,Mon Jul 20 19:56:28 2015 UTC,They run cooler if you have a case with good airflow.
nvidia,3dz2q7,p3dr0maz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:32:01 2015 UTC,I didnt say it wasn't. You will be throttling all day long above 55c then 65c then at 75c.   I've actually had instabilities at some higher clocks because of the GPU Boost 2.0 behavior dropping volts unexpectedly in some high GPU stressed games like Witcher.    My favorite BIOS is actually one w/o boost and constant forced voltage in 3d mode.  Either way im happy with my card. it didnt go over 1500 like my other last two maxwells but its all good.

I just threw it to 110% Power Limit, +65 Mhz core, and that was it and I'm boosting to 1400 consistently in BF4. The lowest the FPS ever got was 95fps on 2560x1440, Ultra Preset, 90Fov on a 64person Lockers Conquest. Often it was sitting around maybe 130-150fps, which fucking blows my mind.  Never went over 70c, fan hit 55% speed and I barely hear it (if that's even the card at all) over my extremely quiet computer. I'm honestly CPU imited in this case with my 3770k.  So far, extremely satisfied. Amazing how it replaced two of the most powerful cards on the market at their time. Annnndddd it uses much less power.

I used Afterburner/Rivatuner to monitor the usage and when I was driving really fast, on the highways. It will go up to around 3400 max.  Most other games stay well below 3GB VRAM. Some games, such as Alien Isolation (a very optimized, yet beautiful game), barely hit 1.5 GB VRAM.  One thing to consider though, is if you are installing huge texture mods or similar. These will eat into your VRAM. That is not to say though, that you can't have Skyrim looking absoltely sexy.  I've never used AMD/Radeon cards, so I cannot say how good or bad that they are. I can only echo what reviewers and users have said. Most have said that the 390 is a great card and trades blows with the 970. Sometimes it even beats it. Everything points to it being, with the 970, the best card you can get for the money.  They are both good cards and you cannot go wrong with either. 390 has the advantage because of more VRAM but most games don't go above 3.5GB and when they do, it is mainly because you have a monitor with a very high resolution."

It is still a beast of a card, even with the vram issue. Editing multiple 4k photoshop files at once and video editing in 4k.  But, yes, it will hinder some newer games on ultra.

I expect it will still be sufficient and not bottleneck the rest of my rig for a few more years yet.
nvidia,3dwxi7,SpaceCowboy26,2,Mon Jul 20 23:37:26 2015 UTC,"I bought a 970 about two and a half months ago. I also have a 1080p monitor. The two most demanding games I'm playing at the moment are GTA V and Dying Light.  I can turn all of the settings in GTA V up to max, excluding:   MSAA, which I leave at 2x and combine with FXAA, instead of a max of 8x Post processing, which I leave at high instead of very high All advanced graphics options, which I leave off   This gives me a solid 60fps in the city but when I go out near the mountains it fairly consistently dips below that (probably because of grass, but I don't want to turn it down because it looks so good). I hate screen tearing so deal with vsync and only having 30fps sometimes.  I have looked at the memory usage a few times while playing GTA V and have seen it go above 3500MB a few times, but didn't really notice any stuttering.  Dying Light, I'm able to max out completely (apart from shadow map size being one notch below max) and maintain a constant 60fps everywhere, no performance hiccups at all.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with how the card is performing at the moment. I knew I wasn't going to be able to max GTA completely with it but didn't want to fork out extra dosh to buy the 980 as it didn't represent as much value for money as the 970 and is probably slight overkill for 1080p in most games anyway.  I'm not sure if it will still be doing as well in a couple of years even at the same resolution; the memory requirement for games only seems to be going up and I'm think a few big releases will push that 3.5GB barrier a bit more.  I don't regret my purchase one bit and the 970 is a great card but  I think the 390 is a better choice for most people. As long as you don't care about it running hotter and consuming more power I think it really is the smarter choice. For that exact reason I would personally not choose it (I prefer having a cooler and more power efficient card because Australian summers get a bit hot). 8GB of VRAM is plenty and in a few years if the memory is not what is holding it back you could easily crossfire to regain some performance."

Now, backplates can help hold the card up and prevent the sag you often see on long cards but on the MSI GTX 970 Gaming 4G that's solved by a piece of metal between the card and the heatsinks.

I myself don't see the point of going beyond 1080p until GPU technology advances to the point where I can get high fps on a 2k/4k monitor as I do on my 1080p monitor and not have to upgrade to a new card until several years. Perhaps Pascal will do that since it's supposedly 10x better than the current series. A GTX 980 is pretty OP right now for a 1080p which is awesome because you can skip a couple of series.   Btw, I have a GTX 780 SC from EVGA with a 1080p 144hz G-Sync monitor. The G-Sync monitor helps with the waiting.    EDIT: Take this with a grain of salt because I never witness a 2k or 4k resolution monitor/tv in person but I'm sure there would be a noticeable difference between 1080p and 4k but not 1080p and 2k.

The same can be said about resolution; the increments in sharpness will only be low from this point on that you will barely notice it. Also, let me remind you that we are talking about monitors and not TVs."

nvidia,3dvm8z,flashen,15,Mon Jul 20 06:57:47 2015 UTC,Fury X in crossfire beats even the Titan X in SLI. The 980ti is better as a single card though.  Source
nvidia,3dvm8z,Tinyds,12,Mon Jul 20 00:57:27 2015 UTC,The problem with the Fury Crossfire tests is that most were done without the newly released 15.7 driver which included a lot of Crossfire improvements. This one is no exception.   So the Fury Crossfire should be even further ahead now.
nvidia,3dvm8z,Smagjus,3,Mon Jul 20 01:32:47 2015 UTC,Generally what I have seen is stock the Fury X in Crossfire beats the 980ti however when you overclock the 980 ti is very close to the Fury X since generally crossfire scales better but the 980ti's have fewer dips in Fps which gives a smoother exoerience.
nvidia,3dvm8z,jcgill,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:09:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, for me the decision came down to knowing the 980Ti had a high overclock ceiling, and the FuryX had an Unknown ceiling (and right now it's very low in OC performance). Also, G-sync capable monitors in my spec range (1440@144 IPS) were more available.   On top of that, I have Terrific airflow in my case (four 200mm fans, with zero interior cage drives), so I know i can keep my blower cards cool.   So, I went with the 980Ti. I'll be getting another 4K G-sync IPS 60hz panel when one comes out thats big enough to justify 4K for me (30+ inches)."
nvidia,3dvm8z,Cereaza,2,Mon Jul 20 01:29:23 2015 UTC,"Crossfire scales better but they are still dealing with worse frametime numbers, last I heard. In that department, SLI is much more stable. That is another thing to take into consideration."
nvidia,3dvm8z,Sethos88,-4,Mon Jul 20 00:46:29 2015 UTC,"Yep with their worse frame pacing, crappier driver support, and only having 4GB VRAM per card? I wouldn't be choosing a Fury X right now.   Edit: I made the AMD crowd mad...ooops"
nvidia,3dvm8z,Soulshot96,5,Mon Jul 20 01:12:40 2015 UTC,"For the record, have a read through /r/advancedmicrodevices and /r/nvidia, then tell me who is dealing with more driver issues."
nvidia,3dvm8z,an_angry_Moose,-2,Mon Jul 20 02:37:17 2015 UTC,"Well, you see, I use Nvidia drivers, and 3 of my friends use them too. We all stay up to date with driver updates, and the worst we have had to deal with in the last month was a few TDR's in Chrome. Which can be resolved by disabling GPU acceleration, downloading the hotfix, or dealing with 1-2 TDR's on your desktop a month. Its a fine tradeoff imo versus waiting weeks or months after a game releases for AMD to update their drivers for it. And in the case of games like GTA V, still not fix launch bugs like MSAA causing artifacts. But lets ignore all that, and let you reading through an echo chamber decide. also, keep in mind that their are over 3000 more users here than on AMD's sub, so more people to complain, and more echo."

Specifically in GTA V, where my card does not. And I would not call Nvidia's driver support shit, sure there is a single TDR bug with chrome, but there are 3 workarounds to that, that I know of alone. Hardly a big issue. Not only that, but they are actively working on that problem, working on Windows 10 drivers, and updating the current set for new games and adding SLI profiles. Far cry better than AMD's current driver situation in my book, as I have already found plenty of people who can't even get the new AMD drivers to install."

Every company has their flaws, but blowing them out of proportion is dumb. Speaking of which, everyone was pissed about amd having cards that run hot, the fury x runs 10-15 c lower then the x/980 ti, where is all the rage about nvidia having hot cards? Oh no amd used a water cooler, why didn't nvidia their cards are the same price point and very similar performance. +/- 10 % depending on settings and source.

nvidia,3dvm8z,Griffith1984,3,Mon Jul 20 02:57:07 2015 UTC,"What I said about frame pacing is perfectly true, what I said about driver support, even now, is still true. And as far as VRAM is concerned, I don't give two fluffy fucking shits about how efficient HBM is, when a 980Ti can play a game with higher settings than a Fury X, without running out of VRAM already, what the fuck does that say for the future? Games are going to start using more, and if 4GB of magical HBM is already not enough for some games, that doesn't bode well. Now, on to you, what the fuck is your problem? You talk like a fucking dumbass fanboy, yet claim not to be. Spout out BS like this: ""its = to 6-8 gigs of gddr5 which puts it even or ahead of the 980 ti"", A. where the fuck did you get that? Got source? No? Hmm, from my readings, yes, AMD did focus on optimizing VRAM use for the Fury X, because even they know 4GB is not really enough. And no matter what they do, its going to come to a point, where it isn't going to be(it already has in games like GTA V, like I said). So get off your high horse, stop ignoring pieces of my argument that you don't want to address, and stop spouting bullshit."
nvidia,3dvm8z,Soulshot96,0,Mon Jul 20 02:27:37 2015 UTC,"And did I fucking say HBM was not better at higher resolution? NO. You're just a fuckwit that doesn't read anything, including his 'sources' correctly. The reason Nvidia is using it on Pascal is because HBM2 should be available by then, and will have a capacity of 8GB. Jesus fucking christ."
nvidia,3dvm8z,Soulshot96,-2,Mon Jul 20 02:32:50 2015 UTC,"The entire premise of this argument was over 4 k res, which you said it was worse at, go back and reread this post."

If you want to go there, my argument is even stronger, as games use even more VRAM at 4k, and they will continue to use more and more. Also, when did I say the Fury X was worse at 4k? It no doubt will be when it hits its VRAM limit, but I didn't say it was, not once. I said it and AMD cards in general, are hampered by their overall worse frame pacing(especially bad in CF), slow driver updates, and the Fury X in general, 4GB VRAM capacity."

Customer support is the first thing you should look for when purchasing a video card, especially if the company is a taiwanese/chinese one. Down there, the companies seem to largely ignore the CS standards we have in europe/Usa and it takes A LOT to get something out of them should a problem appear. Make sure to purchase the card through a retailer with an AMAZING CS such as amazon. Lack of which, I'd gladly settle for a card that looks like a brick  and has 100mhz lower clocks but, comes from a company that has stellar CS. Just my $ 0.02"

If I enable shadowplay my memory instantly rockets to 100% usage (16GB) and then my system eventually crashes. I installed the last driver version and it fixed it. However the first time you launch GFE it forces you to update to the newest broken memory leak version. I haven't been able to find anything on nVidia's end even addressing this as an issue but it's happening to me and several of my friends.

I wouldve bought this card immediately and said fuck the bundles, fuck the sales, fuck whatever else is coming out later, but sadly they dont sell in NA, so it is out of my reach unless i pay hundreds more than msrp on international ebay."
nvidia,3dtstw,Put_It_All_On_Blck,3,Sun Jul 19 22:20:29 2015 UTC,You might as well go with the msi version and match the rest of your build. It's very comparable to the other vendors cards.

MSI is the ""safe choice"" in 980 Ti.  It is the middle ground option in terms of noise, warranty support, cooling, price, overclock, and power consumption.  You won't win in any of those categories but you're not losing in any of them either.  Only downside is I have no idea how aggressive MSI is in bidding on binned chips."

nvidia,3dtstw,r0b3r71,2,Sun Jul 19 19:13:53 2015 UTC,"The clock is better than the EVGA acx2.0. Not sure about the g1. The HOF is more exotic than the other cards, so it will probably retain its value for longer. (So if you want identical cards for SLI in the future, buying a more mainstream card may be easier to find later) I think the HOF cards are binned. Any 980TI can be overclocked, but the silicon lottery will restrict you potentially. I read on overclock.net about a guy that bought and returned the HOF due to bad performance.  Ultimately, what card looks best to you? I liked the EVGA and the HOF, but the fact that EVGA has 24x7 phone technical support, and a better warranty was the tipping point which made me go EVGA. I like the peace of mind that support will bring.   The HOF and the G1 have two 8 pin connectors whereas the SC Acx 2.0 has one 8 pin and one 6 pin."
nvidia,3dtstw,r0b3r71,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:29:30 2015 UTC,"I'm surely wrong...but...i never cared about phone support or others, i'm usually go with the best vale for money product or the most powerful product. I tend to put aside support and give priority to these 2 points"
nvidia,3dtstw,r0b3r71,2,Sun Jul 19 19:38:14 2015 UTC,"Your not wrong if that's what's important to you. The way I see it, if you get a good card, it can be overclocked to around 1500mhz. The guy with the HOF said that he returned his because he couldn't get past 1400 iirc. Some people have great experiences with the g1, while others complain of coil whine.    That's why support is important to me, just in case my card has some type of issue.  Based purely on cost, the g1 is the best option for what you want. Highest performance per dollar. Evga is in the middle, with similar cost with lower performance, and HOF is the highest cost, but you have the nice clean design (black sniper edition will be released in the next week or so) and similar performance to the g1."
nvidia,3dtstw,omnicious,2,Sun Jul 19 19:47:14 2015 UTC,Are there many difference in terms of performance from G1 and G6 (MSI)? Cause my setup is Black/red and the msi will match very well. Also msi price is highest...

However note that it can be overclocked a bit, but I don't think you'll get speeds like the popular Gigabyte G1 980 Ti.  In my case I wanted the lower temperatures and a bit of overclocking.  As for warranty, it's EVGA, so they're a pretty safe bet.  I don't think these hoses are so fragile that there's a high chance of leakage; they're pretty flexible but sturdy."
nvidia,3duv7h,iamapizza,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:45:32 2015 UTC,Yeah I figured It'd safe since EVGA covers it but the main problem here is the warranty of other damaged parts such as my Mb for example.

Considering your biggest issue is minimum framerates and not average frame rates I would do this instead.  Two SLI 980s will introduce even more frame rate drops.  That is the nature of two cards.  A single 980ti will allow for a much more stable framerate, as well as a good bit higher average and minimum frames.  A little bit of work to sell the 980 ofc, but skylake wont do anything for your framerate's because your 2600 cannot possible be bottlenecking your 980 by any appreciable amount."

nvidia,3dtg2d,CaptSkunk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:27:38 2015 UTC,Oh wow I didn't know about that. Thank you for clearing that up.  Well that pretty much sums up my fear about upgrading to a 120hz+ monitor. What if I can't afford to upgrade my system the next year? I will be stuck with 40fps in games and I will miss the 120+ fps. Maybe I will only be able to play minecraft or newer games in lowest settings just to get the high fps?  Or is it not about the ingame fps but more about the monitor's capabilities? I never experienced a 120hz+ monitor. All my friends got 60hz just like me. And you can't watch a video about it on a 60hz monitor I guess haha.
nvidia,3dtg2d,HelperBot_,0,Mon Jul 20 03:09:54 2015 UTC,"For gaming, SLI.   But there's a lot to consider. Skylake will run on a new chipset, will likely not support that RAM. On the otherhand, you're runing an older CPU, not sure how many PCI-E lanes it has, which may be an issue in SLI if you use other extension slots of it the 2600 has fewer than 16 lanes."
nvidia,3dtg2d,Zinthros,0,Sun Jul 19 08:52:49 2015 UTC,If sli can work with the 2600 I don't see a reaskn why it wouldn't work with skylake. There's no reason they'd go down from 16 lanes. Also why shouldn't skylake support that RAM ? It should support both DRR3 and DDR4.
nvidia,3dtg2d,zkDredrick,2,Sun Jul 19 10:07:33 2015 UTC,"Skylake will support DDR3L RAM. That means that for most people, buying new RAM is still a must, in order to upgrade to Skylake/Z170. Most people now, do not have low-voltage RAM installed."
nvidia,3dtg2d,CaptSkunk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:00:54 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand the difference. I have normal 240 pin DDR3 CL11 1600MHz RAM, would I need to upgrade that ? I thought the L at the end for the laptop and sff ram. 204pin I think."
nvidia,3dtg2d,zkDredrick,4,Sun Jul 19 13:32:54 2015 UTC,"So, here is the gist of it.   DDR3L stands for double data rate 3 Low voltage random access memory.   What this means is that any DDR3L sticks, use a max of 1.35 volts. Normal DDR3, which is what a great majority of people have, uses 1.5 volts and even sometimes 1.65 volts.   DDR4 uses 1.2 volts. So, it uses between .30-.45 less volts than the most typical memory and still between .05-.15 less than DDR3L memory.   I'm not 100% sure but I think some processor models can only use one or the other (DDR3 or DDR3L) and it can also be implemented on the motherboard/chipset level.   Basically, low voltage RAM is mainly used for laptops or mobile devices but can also be found in some desktops or even servers. The whole point of it is to save energy or battery life. Also of note, is the fact that DDR4 is aiming to get down to a voltage use level of 1.05 volts but this will take a while."
nvidia,3dtg2d,Cereaza,2,Sun Jul 19 14:55:49 2015 UTC,"Okay that was a great explanation thank you. There's something I still don't  though. The motherboards and processors who would support 1.2  and 1.05, why should they have a problem with 1.5  volts ?  I remember haswell requires 1.5V yet 1.65v still somehow works. Would 1.5V and above not work if the motherboard supports  ddr4 ? Is this somehow confirmed or is this some how just logical and can't be any other way. I really appreciate your help thank you."
nvidia,3dtg2d,A1phaBetaGamma,3,Sun Jul 19 15:09:44 2015 UTC,"Because they are just not designed for so much voltage. Though, I'm not sure if that is strictly a limitation that is implemented through hardware or if it is implemented in the bios.   Basically though, over time, the voltage required for each piece of hardware sinks. Whatever it stabilizes at becomes sort of the standard, though there are variations   Let's look back at DDR2 RAM. It goes from 1.8 volts to 2.3 volts (2.3 volts is just in the specs but most common was 1.8-2.1 volts). DDR was 2.5-2.6 volts.   As I said above, over time, hardware is able to become more efficient; doing the same or more amount of work with less energy required. A perfect example of this are the Maxwell cards from Nvidia or the latest Haswell/Devils Canyon chips from Intel. My old GTX 260, from 2008, used something like 250-275 watts but my 970 uses maybe 200-225 max and delivers 5 times the performance of the old 260.

Just get a very-similarly performing 290 for less, or a 390  which is just an overall better card. I didn't mean this to be a rant but honestly I don't see a reason why anyone should buy a 970 now unless it costs less than $300.  It's not just me who says this either, even Jayztwocents, the guy with 3 titan X's and who has been owning only nvidia cards for a very long time says the 390X is a better do.  Yes I know this is the nvidia sub,.but yes this is the truth. Unless you need something like cuda acceleration there's just no point.   I don't mean to say this directly to you but rather to all the people who recommend 970s. This is other's people's money you're playing with.

Above that, the extra memory of the 390 will make a difference for modern games."
nvidia,3dsi9l,quadraphonic,6,Sun Jul 19 19:24:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but most of these points are rather weak, while yes they are probably true.    They both MSRP at $330 (I think, I don't suppose the 970 is officially cheaper) and it's normal if one of them is 10-20 dollars cheaper, even if a 970 costs $300 and a 390 costs $330 that's still just 10 percent of the price, and it's just as likeyy that a  can also be cheaper. Power consumption I can't argue about that, but the difference in the electricity bills is really negligible, the real problem with higher power consumption is my next point Heat. The 390 isn't considerably that much hotter than a 970, and a cooler like the msi TFV really does a great job at keeping the card both cool and quiet. I'd rather not talk about gameworks. I don't know much about the issues it causes and  most of the rants people claim about it is just speculation, yet there's definitely something shady there, but you can still count that as a point for the 970 I guess. Overclocking you can also count s a win for the 970. There's no arguing that.it overclocks like a beast, butnit everyone overclocks their gpu past 1400-1450MHz to significantly beat a 390.   What I get from this is that a person who would buy a 970 should be a person who doesn't mind upgrading that often (more often than a person who gets a 390), fond of gameworks and is really hardcore about overclocking and likes nvidia's apps and such more, but these are far from the majority, especially those only looking for a temporary card and wouldn't like to mess with overclocking.  Please excuse me if you've found my tone hostile or aggressive, I am only entertaining an argument and for all I know you're just a wonderful person who just likes to play games."
nvidia,3dsi9l,A1phaBetaGamma,2,Sun Jul 19 20:15:18 2015 UTC,I picked a 970 because I was impatient and couldn't get a 390 easily (they were also about -$40 more for me in the CDN market).   I was just playing Devil's advocate noting there are some reasons for choosing one over the other. I'm just excited to leave my 8800GT behind!

I came from a trio of 580s and I and my electric bill are so much happier. I even friended some conservationists. Edit: Real world differences between the overclocks of various 980Tis is minuscule.

My laptop only has a 1080p screen, so I think I'll still be able to go with medium-high setings and get around 40fps. As for upgrading, hell no.

Mind you, 1 GB VRAM still works (with games like The Witcher 3, Far Cry 4 and Shadow of Mordor for example), but 2GB should keep you good to go for the rest of this gen without getting too worried.   Then again, do you aim to play at 2560x1080? It's too high a res for these cards. You will need to play at a lower res than that according to your screen orientation.

You can always turn down texture resolution in the game settings if you're low on VRAM and the game needs more than you have.  But if your GPU is too slow, you'll have to turn down a lot more settings and maybe even run at a lower resolution to get a decent framerate.  I agree with the other comments here that you should get at least a 750 Ti."
nvidia,3dtusn,DonDalle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:14:48 2015 UTC,"Hello!  Feel free to search this subreddit as I've already complained about this card a few times :)  To summarize: My first unit had a loud/perpetual coil whine at all times (idle, gaming, etc). Certainly not all of the cards have this issue, but I've seen it reported enough that it's something to worry about. I returned the first card and got a replacement without this issue.  Beyond that, there are a few other issues that I experienced on both cards that I've corroborated with a few other users. These issues may be present on all of the cards as they currently exist and should be taken into account:  One: Fan behavior. On both of my cards and for at least a couple of other users, our fans don't behave well. They report RPM spikes in monitoring programs (which in itself isn't a big deal) but they also cannot maintain a constant speed. If you set a fixed speed of like ~80%, the fans will stay at that speed... for the most part. They will periodically slow down and speed up for no apparent reason. When the fans get loud enough, it can become annoying hearing the fans spin down and up again quickly.  Two: Power issues. I have yet to have anyone provide screenshot/video proof showing otherwise for this card, so I'm hesitant to perform another RMA until I confirm it isn't a design issue. Basically, this card ships with a firm TDP limit fixed by hardware. Unlike other Nvidia cards, the Power Limit slider/target value cannot be modified. It can be changed in say Afterburner, but the GPU will not honor any changes to the setting. The result is a card that is pretty crippled: try to overclock it a bit beyond stock and, depending on the game, you may immediately hit the TDP wall. This results in the GPU dropping Boost bins and your card ends up running a hampered voltage.   For example, my card defaults to 1430MHz and 1.193V, but likes to sit at 1415MHz and 1.168 V (one bin down). If I bump the core frequency by say 30MHz, the following might happen. (This is with a significant Memory overclock that makes the power issues worse)  Goes to 1460MHz and 1.193V initially, then immediately starts power throttling. It can throttle so bad that it gets down to the 1415MHz it used to settle at, but now the voltage may be 1.155 or 1.13X depening on how many Boost Bins it dropped. The end result is that the card dials back too far and lowers the voltage too much doesn't help with stability.  I'm still trying to gather more anecdotal reports - but for now I haven't seen anyone provide proof that this card has functional Power Limit modification and is hampered as a result."

nvidia,3dr0ak,Kweetus,6,Sat Jul 18 16:52:10 2015 UTC,"Sensible recommendation would be to wait however... I was running 780s on a 4k monitor, most things ran ok with 780s, the only recent game I've had trouble with was Witcher 3 which I knocked down to 1440 and got solid frames. It depends on your situation, if I overclock my 980ti I get better scores in benchmarks but not necessarily higher frames BUT I do maintain higher lowest frames whilst gaming due to it being a single card. So a 980ti is roughly on par with 2 780s so you're dropping all that money for little if any gains, at 1440 I don't think you'll struggle to hit 60 but may struggle to maintain 96. I do plan on getting a 2nd maybe on my Birthday next month or may wait a while see if the price drops."
nvidia,3dr0ak,UnrepentantN00b,3,Sat Jul 18 17:06:20 2015 UTC,"You're response is excellent my friend, thank you. I think I will take your advice and hold off on the 980ti and wait for next gen. I don't think I would ever plan on 980ti SLI, so with the money saved from not upgrading now I may choose to run whatever the next gen card is in SLI and get a 4k monitor. Maybe by then SLI will be even more refined, or something better perhaps. Thanks again dude."
nvidia,3dr0ak,an_angry_Moose,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:42:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's DEFINITELY in your best interest to wait. Two 780s is no slouch, and you already have them, so you're out no cash. Use that savings to hold off and pick up the next extreme class GPU. You know the next AMD/nvidia gpu's will both have HBM2. It could be a big upgrade by then."
nvidia,3dr0ak,BaNaNaKING42,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:11:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah but performance really isn't all when you are going from SLI to a single-card solution. I had two overclocked 780's which score about 1000-2000 points lower than a 980 Ti seems to score on a similar system (don't have the 980 Ti, yet).  However, I had some issues with HDR rendering being too fast in SLI resulting in flickering in certain games. Also temps, noise and power consumption are higher with two cards. So you have to take those things in consideration, too."
nvidia,3dr0ak,UnrepentantN00b,2,Sat Jul 18 17:42:20 2015 UTC,"Valid points, but it wasn't something I really considered, I strapped a aio cooler using a Nzxt Kraken bracket to my 780s so noise and heat were never a problem for me. I still wouldn't consider it a worthwhile upgrade. I only went with it because I like shiny things and have plenty of disposable income. But I think mostly I miss the Gigabyte cooler, I had a 670 with it and hated my 780s with the titan shroud.  Let's be honest, unless you literally can't play the game you want then the sensible advise should always be to hold out, however the final decision is with the op's desires."
nvidia,3dr0ak,BaNaNaKING42,2,Sat Jul 18 18:05:40 2015 UTC,"True. To each his own. For me, SLI wasn't as good as I hoped it would be so I decided to go back to a single card for now. (And, of course: shiny new thing :D )  I want to buy the G1 myself. How do you like it? Do you also have it water cooled? And are you experiencing any coil whine?

Highest temp I've seen is 74deg using my fan curve it hit about 50% fans (start becoming audible at  45-50%) but that was during a stress test, gaming I've only seen mid to high 60s where my fan sits nicely at 35-40%.

nvidia,3dr0ak,LordOfTheGiraffes,2,Sat Jul 18 19:08:35 2015 UTC,What do you guys think about the 1440p monitors with GSYNC? I think there are only two out at the moment and they look expensive. Would that be a more noticeable upgrade over the 980ti? I would be going from an OC'ed QNIX to one of the gsync bad boys. Haven't been able to see one in action myself so wondering what you guys think. I'm pretty happy with the QNIX but have heard good things about gsync. Right now i'm thinking to wait until there are more options/price drops but if its that much of a difference I may pull the trigger on one.

I bought it in January, and it inspired an upgrading frenzy that replaced essentially every single component in my desktop over the last six months. I just had to make my PC more capable of utilizing its goodness!  It's got a TN panel so the viewing angles aren't fantastic, but when I'm gaming I'm the only one looking at it so that doesn't matter. The colors aren't as vibrant as IPS, but the contrast and response are excellent (and there weren't any 1440p, 144 Hz IPS displays with G-sync on the market when I bought it, though I think there are now).  I was really surprised at how amazing g-sync is, and can't recommend it enough. I didn't realize how distracting tearing can be until it was gone."

If you have the hardware to drive a 1440p display it makes no sense to buy one without out it.  Everything is so smooth that it makes gaming a whole new experience when you aren't seeing any tearing or stuttering.  There are only 2 1440p G-Sync displays ATM, the ROG Swift and the Acer XB270HU.  I have a Swift and I briefly had the Acer.  The Swift is miles better in build quality and feels like an $800 display.  The Acer feels cheap, has a glossy finish and is IPS with 4ms response.  The one I had had terrible light bleed, dead pixels and what appeared to be dirt on the panel.  If you research that display you'll find the QC on it is horse shit.  Even though I feel IPS has better colors and viewing angles, I like the Swift more due to the 1ms response and build quality.  If you wait a couple of months, Asus is going to be releasing an IPS version of the Swift."

Rendering a video or 3D animations is the staple of xeons, as they excel at it. i-series processors will almost always give you higher frame rates and more consistent fps's in games, even though cheaper, because they have been optimized for such conditions. And if I were you, go with an i7, the hyperthreading helps greatly with future-proofing and getting rid of a possible** bottleneck, though if you don't have the money i5's will do just fine.

The main difference being that the Xeon series does not have integrated graphics on the chip while the i series does. Thus the Xeon series is generally cheaper. Next, the vast majority of games do not utilize the hyperthreading feature of the i7 series. Most games are actually just now starting to use more than two cores, actually utilizing something like hyperthreading in the mainstream probably won't happen anytime soon. As far as gaming is concerned, the performance difference between an i5 and an i7 is almost negligible, a few frames at most. Certainly not worth the price difference for purely gaming.

nvidia,3dsxsl,Neumayer23,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:51:18 2015 UTC,"980 isn't realy enough for 1440p either unless you are willing to lower some graphic options, keep in mind that 980 is basically a 680 2.0 as in, it's a middle range gpu labeled and sold at a high end gpu price tag. Not to mention that the 4gb of vram might still not be enough in games like shadow of mordor with the ultra texture pack and, 1440p res.  The only good answer for 1440p right now is a 980ti that unfortunately, is way above what you feel comfortable in spending, so your best best would be to hunt for an used 980. Lots of people who upgraded to a 980ti are selling their old 980 so you might find a bargain."
nvidia,3dsxsl,mater36,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:09:09 2015 UTC,Yeah that sounds like the best bet. If I buy a used card does the warranty transfer over to me?

nvidia,3dsv0z,DrexelDragon93,2,Sun Jul 19 03:18:13 2015 UTC,Why? It has about 4K or 4000 pixels  horizontally.
nvidia,3dsv0z,touzainanboku,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:19:25 2015 UTC,"The ""4"" refers to the horizontal resolution of 3840"

nvidia,3dsv0z,Ibestrokin9,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:25:41 2015 UTC,"That's differen, that's their vertical resolution. 1080p, 1440p, 2160p are referred to like that. But also as ""2k"", ""2.5k"" and ""4k"" when referring to their horizontal resolution."
nvidia,3dsv0z,DrexelDragon93,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:19:40 2015 UTC,The confusion comes from 1080p not being commonly called 2k. 2k is a resolution used in Digital Cinema which is a slightly wider image 2048 Ã— 1080
nvidia,3dsv0z,HawkEye0,-4,Sun Jul 19 04:21:30 2015 UTC,"Ummmmmm no, it's 4k because it's 4 times the amount of pixels in a 1080p display.  19202 = 3840 10802 = 2160"
nvidia,3dsv0z,tonn482,8,Sun Jul 19 12:48:11 2015 UTC,No 4k is the cinema standard where the resolution is actually 4096 x 2160 hence 4k horizontal pixels. Ultra HD is the condumer standard and that is 3840 horizontal pixels. Similarly 1080p or Full HD is 1920 horizontal pixels and 2k is the cinema standard where they have the same 1080 pixels tall display but a wider 2048 horizontal pixels.

nvidia,3dsv0z,mater36,2,Mon Jul 20 01:36:57 2015 UTC,"Yes but when you purchase a 4K monitor the resolution it runs in is 3840x2160, so the fact that people are saying that the 4k is a different resolution to that which the average consumer uses, is irrelevant."
nvidia,3dsv0z,tonn482,2,Sun Jul 19 04:12:37 2015 UTC,Doesn't change the fact that it is wrong. 4k is a buzzword as far as the consumer should be considered. 3840x2160 is UHD and frankly I'm pretty insulted that even NVIDIA is calling it 4k when it isn't.
nvidia,3dsv0z,billyalt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:30:23 2015 UTC,"I was just saying that for the average person, they wouldn't be purchasing a 4096x2160 monitor and calling it 4k, they will be purchasing the 3840x2160 monitor and calling it 4k, It's not good to confuse the person you are trying to sell something to."
nvidia,3dsv0z,tonn482,2,Sun Jul 19 07:30:31 2015 UTC,Technically that is UHD though and not 4K (though commonly referred to as). The 4 is indeed the horizontal resolution.

nvidia,3dsv0z,tonn482,3,Sun Jul 19 04:46:49 2015 UTC,4K is 4096 x 2160  perhaps you're referring to UHD(1) - 3840 x 2160

That thing nice and looks really purty. Only kinda pain in the butt thing, is if your benchamarking you have to artificially force the fan to kick in too cool the VRAM and VRM. Since the card never breaks 50 under load, the fan on stock setting literally never turns up. This means that while the VRM is hurting from over-voltage the fan will never automatically increase."
nvidia,3dqhjc,sn1313,2,Sat Jul 18 13:42:37 2015 UTC,"I think it is because your GPU is ""asleep"", and then is jolted awake and cannot respond in time.  I'm currently playing Mass Effect 1. Very old game, easy on the hardware. I'm playing it in a GTX 750 at average clock rate of 900MHz (1359 max) with around 50% GPU usage, temps under 50C. VRAM usage at 500MB max.   Yet, I still see framerate drops when entering a new area especially. My only deduction is that my GPU is almost practically sleeping, that when it has to render more heavily it doesn't respond quickly enough. Not sure if yours is a similar experience.   Also, FPS drops have nothing to do with VRAM. It's related to GPU clocking power. If you run out of VRAM what you see is ugly stuttering."

nvidia,3dqggl,sluflyer06,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:03:42 2015 UTC,It might  appear you have just enough capacity if you try to calculate everything out but your playing with fire and you can end up with odd system behavior and chasing ghost issues.  Also keep in mind capacitor aging and overall bad practice to run something as crucial as your PSU at essentially maximum output all the time which only serves to increase wear and tear on the components prematurely.

If you check reviews though everyone's 980 TI cards under load are going 72c and above.  That was my max with fan @ 100%.  If you check the card owners clubs on overclock.net forums you will see a lot of people water cooling these. I did and now my max load temps are 59c.

nvidia,3dqggl,p3dr0maz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:43:03 2015 UTC,Yeah before I did this the card would throttle itself to try and stay cool.  I think the 1st one  starts around  65c. Luckily don't get that warm anymore. I also increased the power limit up to 127%/350w. That helped a lot too.

nvidia,3dprou,Doctor_Turkleton,2,Sat Jul 18 06:54:46 2015 UTC,"Have you ever heard of the ""silicon lottery""?  There's a phenomenon in pcb/ processor fab where some boards (with the exact same specifications) may be able to operate at lower temperatures and higher clocks than others before becoming unstable.  The ones that can get higher are ""binned"" higher.  Those are the ones that get factory over-clocked because they are more easily able to reach that clock.  You may get lucky and get a regular 980ti that can reach the clock speed of a SC card but it's definitely not a guarantee."
nvidia,3dprou,gsparx,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:24:06 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I had heard of it, but didn't know that they specifically sought out the overachievers of the lot to use for the factory overclocked versions of the card. Thanks for the information. I've seen some pretty aggressive overclocks on the regular 980 Ti, so hopefully I'll get that lucky."
nvidia,3dprou,kittah,2,Sat Jul 18 16:50:36 2015 UTC,"They are physically identical, literally the only difference is the SC has a +100Mhz factory overclock. The PCB is identical, the cooler is identical & the chips for the SC aren't binned any higher. EVGA only bins chips for the flagship models like kingpin or classified.  An SC model does not guarantee more overclocking headroom, it ONLY guarantees your card will run at +100Mhz (about 1320 boost) compared to reference (about 1220 boost). However basically any 980 Ti you get regardless of make or model is going to be able to hit 1400-1500Mhz boost at stock voltage. The only thing that determines that is silicon lottery.  Maxwell chips are actually a bit weird when it comes to overclocking in that they don't respond well to increased voltage except at sub ambient temps (0C or colder) so on air or watercooling you don't really see much benefit from a custom PCB with extra power/voltage since it doesn't help. On previous generations basically more voltage = higher clock with the ability to cool the chip being the limiting factor.  You can read about how maxwell is different straight from Kingpin himself here: http://kingpincooling.com/forum/showpost.php?p=30273&postcount=57  But yeah, nothing to worry about your card is going to kick ass. I also got a 980 Ti through EVGA step up so I have the same card you're getting and it's rock solid at 1480 Mhz (+251 core). This benchmark shows it at stock clocks (1220 boost) vs overclocked (1480 boost). http://www.3dmark.com/compare/fs/5343306/fs/5413053"

nvidia,3dprou,BKachur,2,Sat Jul 18 17:42:19 2015 UTC,"If you purchase two cards which are identical, but one has a default overclock, there would be no difference whatsoever from temps if you overclocked them to the same speed. In the real world they might be a difference due to having a better manufactured chip in one, but that's the silicon lottery on which one you end up with. I am not sure if the cards you mention have different coolers, and you would have to investigate that yourself. But if the SC card had a larger cooling power, it would run cooler that the default card."

ASUS has just been making inferior cards in the last few years. Heck, they couldn't even be bothered to put the right heatsinks on the right cards. Ask owners of the 290X about that one (supposedly, there is now an Nvidia card using an AMD heatsink).   Then, take all of the horror stories of practically non-existent customer service from ASUS and factor that in. If your Strix breaks, you are more than likely going to have to fight to get an RMA. I've heard plenty of stories where the customer was blamed for breaking things that are clearly caused by faulty parts.   EVGA on the other hand, does not care how the stuff broke. As long as you can make it look stock, then they will RMA your hardware. Heck, they don't care if you remove the heatsink, attach a Scythe Mugen to the chip and break it. Just slap the stock heatsink back on, wait a week and you'll have a new card.  ASUS would tell you to get lost.

That'll create a space between the cards and make it a little bit better. side fan blowing some cool air at the cards helps as well, you might also try side fan as an exhaust.  i had an extra 120 mm fan attached to the front with a DIY frame blowing some air in between the cards, that helped a bit too. huge CPU air coolers like Noctua NH-15 or Dark Rock Pro 3 also take some space, I've switched to Swiftech H220 and the fans on rad helped to increase air flow as well if your cables aren't well organised - do it.

Also, what voltage offset are you using, if any? Sometimes adding a slight amount of voltage will grant stability to an otherwise unstable card. For example, one of my original G1s that I have since RMA'd (due to coil noise) would not successfully complete a Fire Strike Ultra bench without setting the voltage to +87 in Afterburner at stock clocks. it was fine on regular and Extreme, but Ultra pushed it hard enough to expose this weakness.

nvidia,3dmfv4,slole,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:36:12 2015 UTC,"NV Surround requires you monitors to have the same resolution. If it is not, then, it runs both monitors at the resolution of the lowest resolution-wise monitor.   In your case, it runs the 1920x1080 monitor at 1680x1050 which results in a lower quality image. There are inconvenient ways to solve the problem.  1] Implement that feature yourself at the game engine level if you are the one writing code. Essentially, query the resolution of available monitors then set-up a render texture which takes the bigger height as y and the sum of widths as x. Create two windows (one per monitor) that share a rendering context and then copy the appropriate part of the render texture to each window.  2] If your game uses DirectX 9 the you could try using softth, http://softth.net/."

I'm running a highly overclocked 980 and it's temps under load were hitting 85 until I added a second intake running at half speed (now it never goes over 79 room temps allowing) and a second top outtake running fan controlled by my second CPU header.   Two in and two out however the way set it up to run meant a positive airflow when the internal case temp (as this will affect the CPU temps) was lower and a negative when the internal case temp got too high.
nvidia,3dl7w1,DTfan82,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:40:42 2015 UTC,I had the same issue with mine. From what I can understand the fan of the EVGA wont even turn on until the card hits 60. I installed EVGA precision X and changed the fan curve to Aggresive and it fixed the problem for me. I now Idle at around 32-35. Hope this helps! Only issue is you have to leave the program open and minimized for it to work.  Edit: Saw you mentioned that you messed with the fan curve.

It'd be nice if nVidia just gave everyone the MGSV code since B:AK is literally unplayable, but of course that's not going to happen since nVidia had to pay for those codes, and I'm sure they're just as pissed about it since you know they thought they were getting another great AAA Batman Arkham game and wound up with the blunder of the century.  ...sigh"

nvidia,3diw9q,NCEMTP,5,Fri Jul 17 02:00:06 2015 UTC,"You need a pump, res, and at least a 360mm radiator (3 x 120mm fans) or 2 x 240mm radiators (you case will determine generally what you will use unless you are handy with tools), the fans to put on the radiator and hose, plus blocks for both cards and some sort of fittings (x2 per part in the loop). The only special part you will need are SLi connectors to go between cards, however you can accomplish the same thing with 4x compression fittings, tubing and patience.  More radiators does not mean a cooler loop. Pick what you like the look of and put it together - if you don't like it you can always swap it for something else. Get block you like and know you like because they are the most expensive parts most of the time.  And last but not least don't mix metals copper/nickel are ok copper/aluminum or copper/brass causes corrosion. And make sure you get something for algae growth like a silver coil, PT nuke, or like I do aquarium stuff (way cheaper) - pick up some distilled water till you decide on a color (CHEAP) and have fun!"
nvidia,3diw9q,techno_babble_,2,Thu Jul 16 20:49:20 2015 UTC,"Sweet...thanks for the info! Are there vendors that I should look at over others for the parts? Also how much do you think I'd be spending on this sort of setup? Is it feasible to just cool the cards and keep my hyper 212 evo on my CPU? I'm working with a Coolermaster HAFX case, for what it's worth."
nvidia,3diw9q,joshruffdotcom,4,Fri Jul 17 01:55:04 2015 UTC,"I've never worked with a HAFX so I don't know for sure. However yes you could run a loop without including the cpu as long as you have the room to put everything in there.  Personally since DangerDen shut down I buy most/if not all my stuff from performance-pcs.com. Prices are about right and the shipping is decently fast/cheap. US based = not sure where you are located.  Price wise it varies, the EK titan block I got copper/acrylic + back plate was ~$150 combined(1 card), compression fitting vary from $3-8 a piece radiator can run as low as $50 and as high as ~$120. Pumps depending on options run about that same price range. RES aren't neccessary but make filling and bleeding the system a lot easier plus they look nice - $20-$100. Tubing would be about ~$25 for 10 foot of decent stuff like PrimoChill LRT. 10 foot should be enough to do the whole system and have some left if you don't waste it.  All in all it will tubing yadda yadda added up you will be between $650-$800 depending on options for a relatively simple loop, all the bells and wistles the skys the limit. Granted ~$450-500 will be on the blocks/backplates alone for 3 titans.  Personally however - with 3x titans I would just cool the cpu as well. It'll be another $50-$60 for the block and throw in two BIG radiators.  Something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFo0kqiU8AA  Depending on how picky you are, and if you don't want to mod the case I would put the thickest 360mm I could fit in the top and put a decent 120mm in the back and you will be fine temp wise - maybe not as low as some depending on the thermal dissipation of the radiators and the flow rate of your pump.  It's like building a race car - 400 ways to get to the same point but there's always something better. For instance I know guys who have as much money in their fittings as some people do their entire water cooling setup. There's corners that can be cut in multiple places, fittings are a good example, that can save substantially on. 3x gpu much less 3x gpu + 1 cpu is quite a feat for a first time water cooling project.   If I was putting that sort of money into a rig and wanted to go full water cooled - I would look into a case made for water cooling. Mountain Mods or Case Labs would be my choice BUT $$$. Like anything else, once you go down that rabbit hole - hold on to your wallet - it gets expensive to have nice things - as you should know by now. ;-)  And if you don't know - remember to keep the RES higher than the pump in the loop - order doesn't matter just make sure you are flowing in on the correct side of the block. Your system will hit thermal saturation at some point and the 'sweet spot' in my opinion, if you can hit it, is within 10C of room temp. Gonna be a rough ride for 3x titans inside a case with limited radiator space. Best of luck! (My titan with appropriate - actually overkill cooling - 28C idle 38C load with the cpu running 41C load)."

I'm running only 2x 980Tis, so that should allow for more space to maneuver and let me keep a little bit more in my wallet. With over $2500 in this build already, I figure I might as well get as much bang for my buck as I can with these top-end cards, and the only way to do that now is liquid cooling.  I'll have to look into the specific more when I have the time to get into it! Thanks much."

AMD is a brilliant company that has pushed innovation and technology forward, and has made PC gaming what it is today. Of course, they would be nowhere with Nvidia and vice versa.

Yes, they have been losing money, but it comes as no surprise as they were releasing new products and working in other areas. And yes I call you a fanboy, in fact, you are one of the biggest fans I have come across. Honestly I don't fully understand why or what you see in it, but that is up to you. Most people on this subreddit and many others are well aware that competition is good for consumers and we need AMD and Nvidia.   Lets take a look at the Titan X. The best card in the world, for 1100$. Not an aftermarket cooler, oh no. But then the Fury X was coming out and Nvidia had to make a slightly gimped version of the Titan X as the 980Ti and sell it at a competitive price point. A month ago the 970 was the best card for the performance in its price range, that title now belongs to the 390. Now the 980 is challenged by the 390x and Fury. The Fury is better but costs a little more, and the 390x is much cheaper and competes well in a few games. The 960 is...really I don't know. The 960 compares to that of a 280 but is beaten by the 280x and 380 at its price point.   The point is, do you seriously think Nvidia won't bring up the price without AMD? The Titan X basically went from 1100$ to 650$ due to the Fury. Intel and AMD also depend on each others existence. If AMD goes under, Intel will have to be split due to US laws, same goes for AMD if Intel were to go under.   Now lets talk Mantle. Mantle was a massive success! Why? Because it started as a single goal: to bring a low level API to the developers. Microsoft reacted with DirectX 12 and Khronos Group were given the Mantle code, AMD has helped both Microsoft and Khronos with the development. Mantle is no longer used, but is now private for AMD to use to test ideas and other thing on it. Mantle itself, never got far, but the goal managed to bring 2 APIs to developer, or well it will.  PhysX by Nvidia would be great if they had done the same as AMD and helped Microsoft and Khronos perhaps implement it into the API, or perhaps taken a more practical route to allow PhysX to run on both Nvidia hardware and AMD hardware. This kind of support would be excellent for gamers. Why? Because with this added support with both hardware companies and the newer APIs, PhysX could become very light and use innovative way to add advanced features that require much less resources. HairWorks is the response to TressFX. Now TressFX runs well on both AMD and Nvidia cards and was released as open source to both. HairWorks on the other hand isn't and runs poorly on anything that isn't a GTX 900 series graphics card. Of course TressFX is not without its faults, and although it most certainly looks excellent, it also sometimes made the hair stretch and didn't have great shadow support. TressFX 2.0 plans to be a landslide better than the first and addresses many of these problems. HairWorks on the other hand does look a little better but comes at a cost, which is framerate and performance, we all saw Witcher 3 get a downgrade from Witcher 2's graphics.  Point being is that being a fanboy is madness, we need both companies. Nvidia is the greedies of the two, but their is no doubt they hold an important role."

A lot of manpower went into it and you're acting like a spoiled toddler. They made it, they get it. yes it is rumor, but don't act like someone just stole something from Nvidia. Nvidia has all the options to go with AMD and be apart of this development, but no, they just decided to let others do it for them.  I think it would be fair.  Let's examine Nvidia now for just one thing. G-Sync, yes it's not an open standard and yes it rocks. But they have held onto it as only a cash cow, they will never share it or give it away. Amd does this once and their toddlers? They could have fought for this to not be an open standard. Btw thank AMD and ATI for the GDDR5 we all use now too   ATI worked in solitude for a whole year before it sent initial specification to JEDEC in 2005. Then, Hynix, Qimonda and Samsung joined the effort to bring the new memory standard to life. When AMD acquired ATI in 2006, new management didnâ€™t touch GDDR5 development and let the team to work in peace.   Also there are many people who support neither company and go to both /Nvidia and /AdvancedMicrodevices  I think you need to stop being an Nvidia fanboy when posting on reddit.

For example, my buddy had a G1 980 that had extremely load coil whine in the rig.   Before we decided to RMA it, we check to see if the coil whine was caused from the GPU itself by putting it inside my PC.  Sure enough, it was deathly quiet so the GPU wasn't the issue in his case.  Flash forward, he decided to buy my exact PSU thinking this was the root issue on the whine.  Unfortunately, it didn't solve the coil whine and simply change the ""tone"" of the coil whine.  All in all, we determine that the coil whine must be attributed to a combination of the PSU and MOBO more than the GPU itself.  Since then he had decided to live with it and use a frame limiter especially in game menu windows to reduce the coil whine sound.  Anyhow, good luck on the coil whine issue and hope it gets solved.

nvidia,3di1vn,FapFlop,6,Thu Jul 16 19:32:16 2015 UTC,My MSI 6G has slight coil whine (barely noticeable) at very high FPS (like 500+). I have set an aggressive fan profile. maintain temps around 70-72c on full load with the fans at 80% and can barely hear them. most 980Tis generally run hot but the MSI ones are slightly hotter. I had mine reach 80c+ until I put a exhaust side case fan right on top of the GPU.

Hopefully the seller won't make it any worse that it is (they're already saying they want to send it to Gigabyte for expertise - WTF?) and just give me another one or swap it to MSI.
nvidia,3di1vn,XXLpeanuts,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:43:06 2015 UTC,Edit: there is a really slight coil whine from the PSU or something else but I can barely hear it (sitting 30 cm away from my PC). I can only hear it when I turn all the fans off. The whine that was coming out from the card was typical for GPUs - getting more intensive when you rotated the camera in game etc.
nvidia,3di1vn,Xintros,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:10:08 2015 UTC,"this is my experience exactly, coil whine above 500 but only noticeable in almost complete silence. my card (84 asic) clocked to 1530 and 7800 hovers at 73deg in firestrike with 80% fan profile which is quiet enough that any practically any sound would drown it out. my noiseblocker case fans at around 80% as well are nearly the same sound level, and those fans are really quiet. so yeah, its a pretty damn quiet card. thing is, this is my third card- first two went back due to unacceptable temps at stock clocks. which is the issue plaguing the MSI cards.. moral of the story? keep rolling the dice til you get a winner?"
nvidia,3di1vn,Gaptun,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:20:55 2015 UTC,"yup noise levels are impressive as in can barely hear them over case fans, that's I have the fan profile a bit aggressive.   84 Asic is impressive there and a nice overclock.

nvidia,3di1vn,thetonyk123,4,Fri Jul 17 14:32:58 2015 UTC,"Did you try a custom fan curve? My G1 is far quieter than my old XFX 280x card was with my fan curve. Its temps are really good I have found, the 3 fans really helps. Coil whine I only get at like 300+ fps so if you were getting it lower then fair enough, but I think most if not all 980 tis will have coil whine.   My g1 is OC at 1429/7500 and never reaches about 75C with a very aggressive fan curve that does not go over 50% until it reaches 80C which it never does.  Sorry I cant provide any of the info you wanted on the MSI card, I just thought it best you know the G1 can be good, though it may be I was used to a loud card and the G1 is quieter than it but still too loud for you."
nvidia,3di1vn,BearinG,2,Thu Jul 16 13:46:33 2015 UTC,I wish I was getting the whine and buzz only at 300+ fps. Mine was whining at 60 fps in Witcher 3. Which software did you use for the fan curve? OC Guru II ?
nvidia,3di1vn,BearinG,3,Thu Jul 16 14:12:25 2015 UTC,"Damn thats bad yea I would have RMA'd that too. But that was definitely a faulty card. Yes the OC Guru II, its good for OC and Fan curve but my god its annoying that it wants to inform me every time I start my computer up that I have overclocking enabled. You would think a program specifically designed to OC a GPU would not have a pop up every damn launch."
nvidia,3di1vn,UnrepentantN00b,2,Thu Jul 16 14:14:27 2015 UTC,Hopefully they'll change it to another one. I've noticed that I can make it run much quieter with a custom fan curve (what's yours) so these loud fans are not that much of a problem but the coil whine is.

And the temps are really good in the 60's mainly, if you are ok with running hotter you could keep the fan at 50% through out I am sure.   This is with an OC at boost of 1429/7492"
nvidia,3di1vn,sluflyer06,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:15:37 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot man! When I will get it back (hopefully a new one with coil whine) I'll definitely try your curve. You're not using the 0db feature at all? Or do you enable this curve only during gaming?

It's also a pretty quiet card in my opinion (very subjective thing of course.) I have not touched the fan profile or clock speeds at all. The temps top out at 79Â° and the fans are up to about 80% at that time. To me the card is quieter than the sapphire R9 290 tri x I just replaced it with."

My case (Corsair 600T) is closed with a ""mesh"" window.  I don't have a G1 to compare but I find the fans are surprisingly quiet even under load. My case fans make more noise than the GPU... CPU is watercooled (H100 set on low speed.. 2x120mm).  The GPU fan speed goes up to 63% when doing benchmarks back to back (Core@1504Mhz, Mem@~7600Mhz..ASIC 67.5%) and temps reach ~75-76Â°C. Ambient temp was fairly warm this week at ~25-26Â°C in my basement.  I was going to get the G1 (best performance it seems) but the local shop had an MSI in stock so I went for it. I really have no regrets since I do prefer quieter myself and the performance is there.  I guess I automatically assume the G1 might be louder since it has 3 fans but as someone else mentioned, maybe with a custom fan profile, you might get the same results."

Screens go black for a second the moment when the 3D world of games initializes, then TDR crash.  This happens in GTA 5 and Witcher 3, other games I've tried that work fine are TF2 and Cities Skylines, haven't tried any more demanding games.  My system is freshly installed with nothing but the games, drivers, directx runtimes etc. on it (no logitech stuff etc.)  This started happening when the last GTA update came out, sometimes I'm lucky enough to get the game to render a frame or 2 before it crashes (gta), in these frames, shiny surfaces are usually green or pink. Witcher 3 crashes the drivers instantly when I skip the intro movie.  GPU is NOT overheating - the drivers crash instantly so there isnt even time to get the temps up  Things I've tried:  Underclocking/Overclocking GPU  Underclocking/Overclocking CPU  Display Driver Uninstaller, installing the last 5 or so nvidia drivers, including latest hotfix, selecting only the graphics driver and physx each time  Reinstalling OS: tried with fresh installs of win 7, win 8.1, win 10  Removing Nvidia GF experience  Unplugging my second monitor  All possible game graphics settings permutations  Power management settings in win to ""high performance""  10 passes of memtest86  5 hours of furmark  5 hours of prime95 (all temps are fine, no errors)  Changing the CPU and motherboard  Changing the PSU  I've probably forgotten something I've tried, but the point is that the fault is clearly on Nvidia's side and they aren't doing anything to fix it.

Should i switch to dual single 8 pin for better power delivery or is the single rail split cable okay? I am getting the MSI Gaming 6G which is overclocked, so i'm not sure."
nvidia,3dgaj9,BlayneTX,3,Thu Jul 16 01:17:02 2015 UTC,If you have two 8-pin cables then use those. This is especially true if you end up overclocking with a custom bios and a higher TDP and are sending 150w+ through each cable.

nvidia,3dgaj9,ImaEvilDoctor,2,Thu Jul 16 10:10:59 2015 UTC,Always split up power as much as you can. Good choice. No need to starve a monster card.
nvidia,3dgaj9,ImaEvilDoctor,2,Fri Jul 17 03:32:13 2015 UTC,"You should be able to use the dual 6+2 pigtails on the right for your GPU. I use the same on my 970s.  I personally don't think it looks that messy, but I guess it depends on how you tuck the cables. Using your image as reference, I have the top 6+2 plugged into the GPU's right set of PCIE slots and the bottom set of 6+2s plugged into the left PCIE slots. The extra 2 pins is tucked in between the pigtail loop.  It does stick out a little bit, but I have a 760T which is rather wide so it doesn't get in the way of my side panel."
nvidia,3dgaj9,Juts,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:22:52 2015 UTC,"I have a Define R4 which is also pretty wide. For my current card it is okay. I chose the loop as i wanted to use the least amount of cables necessary to get a very clean build. I removed most of my interior. I must say the loop always kinda annoyed me, but i wasn't sure if it's safe to use two cables for one card on my modular. The cables are kinda misleading. I thought i had to use the one that has all the connectors required on a single cable and only use the other if the card only has one connector."
nvidia,3dgaj9,hdshatter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:39:07 2015 UTC,I think the pigtail type cables were manufactured later due to consumers complaining about having to run two separate power cables from their PSU to their GPUs.  I did a little bit more Googling and found some posters on LinusTechTips who said they were able to run 400W through a braided pigtail without much issue. If it's true then a 980Ti should be perfectly fine using a pigtail since it's at 250W at max load.  If someone more technically inclined could confirm/dispute this that would be a nice help to me as well since I'm on EVGA's step-up waitlist for my own 980Tis. I'm fairly certain it's safe for 970s which are only around 150W.
nvidia,3dgaj9,hdshatter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:59:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's what i thought too on first sight. I currently run a AMD R9 280x on single pigtail cable and that is known to draw up to 300w under load. I am almost certain there wont be an issue in delivery, but i have respect for the more high end hardware and guessed things have to run a little different now. Especially when going into (factory) overclocks."
nvidia,3dgaj9,rodrosenberg,2,Thu Jul 16 05:41:22 2015 UTC,"If you have a single rail power supply I dont think it matters. If you have one with 2 rails, you probably want to use two cables to split the load"
nvidia,3dgaj9,djisadud,2,Thu Jul 16 02:55:15 2015 UTC,"I always use separate cables, when I had a 290x I was able to get higher overclocks by using seperate cables."

nvidia,3dip9a,kittah,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:45:38 2015 UTC,This helped me before and i mentioned it to someone else and it didnt help them but ill say it again in case it does. If you have power management mode set to adaptive some games which dont use a lot of CPU wont boost your clock. It happened to me with DX9 on Path of Exile. I changed Power Management mode just for that game to Performance and after that it would stay at the base clock permanently.

On-topic; The possibility that the audio being fried by the gpu is highly unlikely. It might be the realtek audio drivers which comes with the graphics driver conflicts with earlier drivers you had installed with the 660. You might want to reinstall drivers thoroughly.

If you have the GPU power to spare it certainly is but it's preference. I don't mind playing TW3 at 45 fps, I find it fine for gameplay. Max Payne 3 is a good example without DSR you get 200fps+ why not run it at 4k. It's really just another performance/visuals trade off that is kind of up to each persons preference.   As for GTA V it will always have aliasing at 1080p. Even at 4k with AA on you will still notice small amounts but it does look a lot better, it's the engine I guess."
nvidia,3dgpk9,jim2point0,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:19:16 2015 UTC,While playing all games I notice that my frames indeed to up at 1080 if I keep my settings but running a game at 50 to 60 at 1440p feels more sluggish than 55 to 75 at 1080. Thus I feel that anything less than 60 just feel slower.   Is that just me?
nvidia,3dgpk9,hdshatter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:49:15 2015 UTC,"I think I get what you mean but that feeling goes away after 5 minutes of playing, I can definitely notice the difference between 1080p60 and 1440p45fps but once you adjust 45 is perfectly playable but again it's preference. Plus some games you can DSR with 60fps+ easy.   I know some people that prefer fps however I lean towards visuals, it does depend on the game though. It also depends on your monitor refresh rate, if you have 120/144hz it's very different"
nvidia,3dgpk9,MilkManEX,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:04:06 2015 UTC,Well anything below 60 and you'll start feeling the variable framerate differences which will always be a bit jarring. That's why Gysnc was invented.
nvidia,3dgpk9,hdshatter,2,Thu Jul 16 16:37:07 2015 UTC,I prefer injecting SMAA over DSR.
nvidia,3dgpk9,kovensky,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:19:17 2015 UTC,"That's reasonable from a performance perspective, but as far as image quality goes (because post process AA doesn't touch subpixel or temporal aliasing), there's just no substitute for downsampling. SMAA does make a nice companion to DSR/GeDoSaTo, though. Now, if you're sporting a 4k monitor anyway, SMAA is probably all you'd ever need to make things look nice."
nvidia,3dgpk9,XXLpeanuts,2,Thu Jul 16 11:34:22 2015 UTC,Should of added I play at 2560x1440 so I don't need as much AA to make it look good.
nvidia,3dgpk9,sn1313,2,Thu Jul 16 11:40:39 2015 UTC,"You actually want to combine DSR with AA if you can, because DSR uses a rectangular sampling grid, while higher quality AA uses various sampling grids to better resolve the render.  What this means in practical terms is, DSR will handle everything well except for nearly-vertical or nearly-horizontal lines. Adding another AA to it (even FXAA) improves the quality by, at worst, hiding the parts DSR fails at."
nvidia,3dgpk9,cykbryk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:28:32 2015 UTC,"While games look amazing using DSR (I have native 1440p monitor and I use DSR to get 4k resolution in a lot of games) I still find myself needing fxaa or smaa in some games to get rid of ALL the jaggies. I use 25% smoothing though, you can use higher values to lessen the sharpness of edges but the image quality suffers.   Overall, if you can afford to performance wise, use dsr because its awesome."
nvidia,3dgpk9,crschindler,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:52:13 2015 UTC,"I usually use DSR over AA at 1080p...the only thing I notice is that the game is sharper...but I prefer it over the blurred dull look of 1080p textures...and soft edges...  I bounce back and forth, especially since I record and have to set everything at 1080p"

I have a microcenter in town and go there fairly often as do my friends, we have been denied price matching most of the time even with the store manager.

nvidia,3dfi9p,Izviral,7,Wed Jul 15 21:30:24 2015 UTC,I'll recommend the Gigabyte G1 as it will likely have the highest OC potential of any of the vanilla aftermarket cards.
nvidia,3dfi9p,BlayneTX,2,Thu Jul 16 05:22:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed currently have one and while I came from a 280x, its quieter, has fantastic OC room, I like the default OC program too guru II its decent enough.   The thing is great and the exact same size length wise as my 280x."
nvidia,3dfi9p,XXLpeanuts,8,Thu Jul 16 13:56:31 2015 UTC,"EVGA's coolers are pretty good, but they are smaller than a lot of their competitors' because they're the same size as reference.  Personally, I think the ACX coolers look the best (if that means anything to you), and I happily take a slight cooling performance hit for the excellent support EVGA provides."
nvidia,3dfi9p,Aldarro,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:38:36 2015 UTC,It's the same size but is it a custom PCB or is it still a reference? I'm curious because I'm in EVGA's step up to their base 980Ti model and I might be interested in water cooling in the future.  EKWB looks like it has GPU coolers for reference 980Tis but when I was previously looking at coolers for my 970s the EVGA ones were not compatible with any of EK's full blocks.
nvidia,3dfi9p,ImaEvilDoctor,2,Thu Jul 16 02:27:49 2015 UTC,All of EVGA's 980 Tis are reference PCB except for the Classified.

Most will be water-cooling those bad boys."
nvidia,3dfi9p,Aldarro,2,Thu Jul 16 21:06:19 2015 UTC,"Well, that's the beauty of choice, I suppose! I personally think the ACX cooler looks simple and classy, but I do have an appreciation for the more extravagant designs as well (such as the new Strix or Windforce coolers)."
nvidia,3dfi9p,Aldarro,3,Thu Jul 16 20:34:13 2015 UTC,"The BP stands for backplate - it helps with rigidity I believe ( more info on SuperUser ).  I just purchased that same card two weeks ago - upgraded from an AMD 7970, very very happy with it thus far."

nvidia,3dfi9p,hdshatter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:28:29 2015 UTC,A lot of people don't see zotac as a serious brand so their amount of users is pretty small to begin with.
nvidia,3dfi9p,billjanke,2,Thu Jul 16 11:21:20 2015 UTC,"Can't go wrong with EVGA.  Personally, I went with the EVGA Reference SC model simply due to availability back on June 2nd.  Haven't regretted it sense.  Of course the benefit of your model that you picked is the added backplate and the aftermarket cooler design.  But in all honest, you can't go wrong with any 980Ti.  Also in terms of overclocking, it's actually pretty easy to do without modifying the voltage on these cards so I'd consider trying it and see what it's all about."
nvidia,3dfi9p,Syliss1,2,Wed Jul 15 22:12:58 2015 UTC,"I just have a stock Gigabyte one, but my old 770 was EVGA, and I was very happy with it."

This gives me the card now and then the option of buying a water cooler later (likely the Hybrid). I only have a 1080p display so the 980ti is super overkill, but for my system I couldn't be happier ."
nvidia,3dfi9p,t0shki,2,Thu Jul 16 02:27:24 2015 UTC,"It's a tough one. Depends on what you are looking for in a card. Is it  size, silence, balance, speed, looks.. etc. All factors in on your decision.   Please take the following with a grain of salt. I do not own any of them and use my knowledge gathered from studying reviews. Mainly Guru3D and watching many YouTube reviews.  From my research i can tell you that the ""Zotac AMP! Extreme"" is the fastest yet, but also not very silent at that. The ""MSI Gaming 6G"" comes close by a few FPS but is a also less noisy. ""Gigabyte G1"" is in the middle in performance and noise.  The ""EVGA SC+"" is very silent, but also doesn't have that huge of a factory overclock to work with.   I don't have any RMA experience with said companies and i personally went with MSI. It really really depends what you want. If its raw performance, go with Zotac i'd say. They really pushed their model hard. But i can't tell first hand."
nvidia,3dfi9p,DexRogue,2,Thu Jul 16 02:29:27 2015 UTC,"My vote is for the Gigabyte G1. I love mine, it's a beast and it's super silent, I can't hear it over other fans in my case and the temp never goes above 71."
nvidia,3dfi9p,Icanhaswatur,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:51:55 2015 UTC,"Take a look at reviews of each card and read the temperature part. I just ordered a SC w/ACX, and reviews don't show it ever going over 75c at load. That's is pretty good and Def good enough for me. My reference regular 980 hit 80c so fast, that I'd so so glad to have it at 75c full load.   It may not be the best among all of them but for 650 it seems like a steal to me."
nvidia,3dfi9p,Syn246,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:02:21 2015 UTC,"If you are not overclocking at all, buy the card with the highest factory OC so that you get the best performance for your money. Cooling and power delivery will not be issues at these clock ranges.  If you do decide to OC, you will be better served with a card that has an aftermarket PCB due to the increased power target and improved delivery of stable, clean power to the GPU. Plus, non-reference PCB means it will have a non-reference cooler, allowing you to clock higher while maintaining lower temps vs. a reference cooler."

They've had major issues with every release since the Far Cry 4 driver last November. The good news is that some of the newest hotfix drivers are finally addressing some common stability issues so hopefully this will all be behind us soon.  My overall point is: if you experience crashing with a certain driver, assume it's the driver itself and try a new version before dismissing it as a defect with the card or a result of an unstable OC. My first driver test with SLI G1s resulted in crashing in the low-1400 core clock range--I was horrified that I got one or two dud cards but as soon as I tried the 353.38 hotfix driver I was able to go over 1500 core clock fully stable."

So even with AK being the disaster that it was, that was still a not-trivial amount of money spent on the promo, money that they can't get back. Anyone who got the AK promo code already bought a card, so those sales are already done, meaning there's no incentive to give those people more games.

nvidia,3dgca2,iWoundPwn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:11:40 2015 UTC,Is the card over clocked? Which version of drivers are you running? I had small issues like this once and it was the graphics card getting hot and down clocking for like a second or two then recovering back to its boost clock. Try using precision X or afterburners osd to look at temps and boost clock.

nvidia,3dgca2,FunktasticLucky,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:56:36 2015 UTC,You need to verify that's the issue first. In my case I just needed to make a more aggressive fan profile.
nvidia,3deogw,FunktasticLucky,2,Wed Jul 15 18:05:01 2015 UTC,"2 Gigabyte G1s here. I'll mostly be talking about my experiences with SLI. But I'll post some single card benches.    Benchmarks  Card 1: 76.5% ASIC - max boost 1530mhz, +400 memory   Firestrike Normal Firestrike Ultra   Card 2: 69% ASIC - max boost 1520mhz, +600 memory   Firestrike Normal Firestrike Ultra   Both Cards in SLI   Firestrike Normal Firestrike Ultra   Note: All benches are run on Windows 7. Those graphics scores would actually be higher on Windows 8.1, so keep that in mind if you're using that operating system instead.    Temps, Noise  Here's my afterburner setup in SLI:   +130% power limit (no harm in maxing this) +87mV +110mhz core - boosting to a max synced core clock of 1510mhz +400mhz memory   When pushing both of these cards (for example, Witcher 3 in 4K) you're going to be generating a decent amount of heat. 2 non-reference 980TIs in SLI is a recipe for a space heater in your room. Especially if you overclock them further. I can feel the room temp raise a degree or two, and my entire case is probably feeling the burn as well. The top card will easily jump to 80 degrees unless you set an aggressive fan profile. In turn, that will cause a lot of noise.   The best solution is to have a big fan in the side panel of your case to blow air into the GPUS for the top card to suck in. That's been keeping my top card at a maximum of 75 degrees and 75% fan speed, which is not audible when I'm playing any games due to wearing headphones. My wife can't hear it from the next room over so that's my very specific and indepth review of the noise levels :P   Several reviews cover this sort of thing though. Here's Guru3D:   Temps Noise levels   Compare that to another popular card, the MSI:   Temps Noise levels   The Gigabyte runs cooler and a little bit louder."

With that said left at default my cards are boosting to 1314mhz.  As son as EK releases blocks I'll be ordering them and then OCing."
nvidia,3deogw,ggwp9999,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:18:59 2015 UTC,just curious what is the fan speed for your top and bottom card and the temps? Thanks
nvidia,3deogw,jim2point0,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:24:57 2015 UTC,"I'll get some data for you later (I'm in the office).

nvidia,3deogw,jim2point0,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:29:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot. I'm asking because I too have GTX 980TI in SLI but they are struggling to keep the temp at normal range (75-82c top card), i have to turn the fan speed all the way to 80% to have it stable at that."
nvidia,3deogw,Luckyduck1337,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:34:55 2015 UTC,"Thing is, non-reference coolers are all intake while reference coolers use blowers. The blower style coolers are usually recommended for SLI. The non-reference cards needs to suck in air to keep the GPU cool, but the bottom card will restrict that airflow and will also cause the top card to suck in hot air as well.   The only solution is to have cooler air from outside the cause get blown into the case via a fan on your side panel. A lot of airflow from the front of the case will help too, of course. Or just have the door off and have a fan sat next to the tower :P"
nvidia,3deogw,jim2point0,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:33:04 2015 UTC,I'm not so sure this is very accurate. I don't know how much air is being restricted. The issue is that it's dumping so much heat in the case and the bottom card is directly feeding that hot air into the top cards fans. I'm gonna buy a G1 and run it up top and then a reference down under and see how it goes.
nvidia,3deogw,Luckyduck1337,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:07:42 2015 UTC,"and will also cause the top card to suck in hot air as well.   That should have been my primary point. You're right, I'm not sure that ""restricting airflow"" is the primary reason, but it makes sense in my head. It's mostly that the air between the cards is going to be hot, and the only way to solve that is to have cool air being blown into that space. Or.... ya know... water cooling. But that's too hardcore for me."
nvidia,3deogw,jim2point0,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:12:20 2015 UTC,Well for now I'm keeping my HAF932. I have 4 gentle typhoon's ap-15 running wide open. It keeps my EVGA 980 acx's pretty cool. They are on a very aggressive profile but you still see the temps rise when running heaven benchmark. They will both get to like 54C and then slowly climb as they saturate the air with heat. After about 30 min the bottom will stabilize around 59-60 and the top 67-68.
nvidia,3deogw,Luckyduck1337,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:09:52 2015 UTC,"My one G1 980 TI does push out a lot of hot air into the case, which is to be expected.

I think I could get a bit more performance out of it but I think the heat is becoming an issue. Also the memory can go higher without issue, I was just trying to bring down overall temps.

nvidia,3deogw,bisjac,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:02:07 2015 UTC,"I just can't help but want to dial in the performance to my cards max.   That's definitely fun. A custom bios will help. I was able to squeeze 60mhz more on the core clock witha custom bios when I had a single 980TI (The EVGA SC+). But due to availability issues, I couldn't get a 2nd one of those so I opted for 2 Gigabytes for SLI instead.  But having a single card makes a custom bios easier, and allows you to push the clocks to the max whereas in SLI you need to find common ground between the two cards."

The other one only does 246 :( it lost the lottery there lol.   I have great cooling but I'm still worried about the 980 ti dumping way more heat than my 2 980's. Which is why I went reference on the bottom and will probably pick up a G1 for the top since everyone has been getting great results on here with them. Plus I can run both my monitors without an adapter.

nvidia,3dfr30,Popingheads,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:57:31 2015 UTC,"I don't personally own the computer but my brother is running EVGA SC 980 Ti's. Under a full gaming load (specifically Metro LL) the bottom card hits about 72-73 degrees and the top one hits about 83. That is with the default fan profile by the way.  Case cooling is one 140mm rear fan (on a radiator), two 120mm top fans and two 140mm intake fans at the bottom/front. It is set up to have a positive case pressure.  So the temperatures aren't the best however with the stock blower you will still be hitting the low 80's on an overclocked card anyway. I guess having the blowers would be nice for keeping the CPU cooler, but to be fair the CPU doesn't get over the mid 50's anyway."

nvidia,3dg5cv,HeyOmni,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:30:45 2015 UTC,i just upgraded from mine and bought a used 780. i also upgraded my monitor to a 1440p one. Its nice but even that big a jump was not as big in performance as I was expecting. If your at 1080p get a 770 for cheap and ride out til next gen.
nvidia,3dfayz,frostfire2k,4,Wed Jul 15 20:39:04 2015 UTC,"In witcher 3, what is the resolution set at? DSR isn't like AA, it enables higher resolutions for games to use and then intelligently filters and samples it down to your native resolution. Having DSR on doesn't change anything unless you're set to those higher resolutions."
nvidia,3dfayz,SirCrest_YT,3,Wed Jul 15 20:45:07 2015 UTC,"So if i enable the newly allowed resolution within the game after turning up DSR, then ill see the new resolution? I knew it always sortof felt like it wasn't changing much haha"
nvidia,3dfayz,SirCrest_YT,7,Wed Jul 15 20:49:22 2015 UTC,"In the NCP, Enabling DSR adds extra resolutions over the native resolution. So for example, you're on a 1080p monitor, you enable 4.00x DSR, you then go into Witcher 3 and select 3840x2160, you are now using DSR. DSR when enabled is simply adding extra resolutions, nothing changes if they aren't selected in the game.  If you have your game still at 1080p, DSR isn't being used, hence probably getting some ridiculous FPS, and also once you see 4x DSR you will instantly know the difference. besides performance Witcher 3 looks so damn good with downsampling."
nvidia,3dfayz,SirCrest_YT,3,Wed Jul 15 20:52:17 2015 UTC,"I turned it up to 1440p and selected it in-game. MY frames went down to the 60-70 range. This is good buuuut.  Strangely, after playing it at over 100 frames this whole time, 60 frames doesnt even look that smooth anymore. WTF! 60 frames used to look super clean to me and now that i've been playing everything at over 100 frames it looks only sub par. Yikes, maybe i will stay at 1080p after all"
nvidia,3dfayz,SirCrest_YT,2,Wed Jul 15 21:06:39 2015 UTC,"You got hairworks off, right?"
nvidia,3dfayz,SirCrest_YT,2,Wed Jul 15 21:09:28 2015 UTC,"Ya its off. Another thing i'd like to point out is how DSR seems to cause a very difficult to describe ""wave"" on textures, i'm mostly seeing this while moving around and looking at large textures i.e. a big roof (all one color). It's very distracting and imo this renders DSR totally useless. But it does give me a good sense of how it would look at 1440p"
nvidia,3dfayz,billyalt,3,Wed Jul 15 21:15:59 2015 UTC,"Adjust the gaussian filtering in NCP, perhaps lower the smoothness factor which might contribute to that."
nvidia,3dfayz,kittah,2,Wed Jul 15 21:18:15 2015 UTC,"As it turns out, turning the smoothness factor up got rid of the waves. Thanks for the help man, would have never found out how to use DSR on my own haha"
nvidia,3dfayz,Lobrauski,2,Wed Jul 15 21:23:28 2015 UTC,"Increasing the smoothness basically spreads out the filtering width on the downscaling filter. Probably helps those wave artifacts but makes the image softer.  Should still feel sharp due to the higher resolution in any case, glad it worked out."
nvidia,3dfayz,billjanke,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:36:10 2015 UTC,"Those waves are known as moire patterns, a side-effect of DSR's downsampling implementation. Smoothness factor is a Gaussian blur shader that is supposed to help reduce moire patterns, but can also blur the image."
nvidia,3dfayz,Syn246,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:45:33 2015 UTC,By far the best looking DSR settings for 1080p is 4k downsampled since its actually a perfect multiple (2x in each direction) so you don't get that weird crawling on pixels. At 4K->1080p you can set the smoothing factor to 0. Unfortunately 4k kills framerate.  At any factor below 4x you really need to use that smoothing filter to eliminate the crawl. 15-17% seems to work well enough for 1440p->1080p
nvidia,3dfayz,HawkEye0,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:46:50 2015 UTC,This was my experience too with the FPS it just didn't seem as smooth anymore. Occasionally it'll drop into the 40's at 1440p and that is just unpleasant.

Like i said before, get a real game that requires the 980 to even begin to stretch its legs and you will see the diff."
nvidia,3dgo3i,sn1313,3,Thu Jul 16 03:09:33 2015 UTC,The 980ti has more cuda cores and is a different chip than a 980 classified. A 980ti will beat the 980 classified in every single category relating to performance even if the 980 is clocked higher.

The fans were running at 100% and as I was dialing in the OC it would whine and make a bit of a grinding noise, also classified as coil whine I believe, right before the drivers would crash and restart.  Other than that, no coil whine under normal use.  For reference I got my card stable at 1520 but I dropped it to an even 1500 to bring down the thermals.

nvidia,3ddc2e,jim2point0,5,Wed Jul 15 14:38:48 2015 UTC,"My thoughts are if you are running a custom loop the classified is probably the safest bet for high clocks.  If you want the highest clocks with on air - the G1 is probably going to do that better.  However, EK is supposedly coming out with a block for the G1, and at voltages most everyone uses it will probably come down to the silicon lottery.  If you are going to go crazy and go over 1.3v with the card - then the classified is the only one that can probably do that safely, however KINGPIN himself has apparently said that there isn't much to be had with these cards past 1.28v"

PEOPLE WITH DISCONNECTING ISSUES: On the last sale of these myself and 3 other friends bought them. We all had disconnecting issues and now we don't.  There are a few major things that will cause these to disconnect randomly.   Cell phone near (~4ft) next to the receiver. Routers that use channel 6 that are within ~30 ft of the headset. Change your routers channel and this will probably go away. (worked for 2/2 of us who were still having problems) Multiple G930s in close proximity to each other. I play games with my girlfriend across the room ~10 ft away all the time with no problems, but when one of my other friends comes over and sits on the desk between us with his set, we all get disconnects (not often though).   I hope this helps. This is a fantastic headset and for this price you really can't beat it. If you live in a close quarters apartment complex though you may have issues with other people's routers.

Didn't really do much for me removing Logitech Gaming Software, problem with my card is low gpu utilization. (Power set to Pref Max)  On Witcher 3 the game runs flawlessly, as it should with any 980ti.  However, on pretty much every other game, it likes to push out like no gpu usage, ending up with less fps.  An example would be Borderlands 1, Usage sits around 20-30% with 60-90FPS, this is annoying since I play on 144hz. Another example is Far Cry 4. Game pretty much sits on 70-75% usage and results in like 70-90FPS constant. The above happens with every game the card is meant to absolutely destroy.  Specs are i7 3770 & MSI 980 TI Gaming.  Forgot to mention that even on Fire Strike (normal) the usage stays low, so i'm getting a shit score from it. When I up it to the 1440p variant, usage goes up but it stays around the same fps as the other test because its like trying to perform consistently or something.  Update:  Did another test on normal Fire Strike. In the first graphical test my usage was at 45%, resulting at 48fps during the test... why?"

Regarding your GPU, have you thought about selling it and putting the money towards a 980 Ti? You can always sell the 980 Ti when Pascal comes out, and this might not be for another 12-18 months.  Another option would be to add a second 780 Ti for SLI--I imagine they're well into the mid-low $300s second-hand, if not lower. You'll be stuck with 3GB VRAM going this route though."

nvidia,3deqle,jim2point0,2,Wed Jul 15 18:29:36 2015 UTC,"With 2 cards in your case, you're restricting airflow to the top card. The non-reference cards use intake fans (not blower fans like reference). Also, because you have a GPU already running hot on the bottom, the air the top card will be sucking in will likely be hot as well. So it's no surprise that the top card heats up WAY more than the bottom card.  The only solution other than a custom fan profile (which will ramp up crazy high) is to have plenty of intake fans in your case, especially a big on the side panel that's situated in front of the GPUS (so the top card has cool air to suck in)."
nvidia,3deqle,mull54,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:06:27 2015 UTC,I had 2 gtx 970 g1 gaming and the top card had a temp of 60-62c and the bottom card had a temp of 75c(my target temp. So it would throttle after that). So if you have 70-72 and 84c on the second card I think it's seems pretty logical. It is often recommended that you don't use two custom cards if you don't have extremely good case cooling because the top card will dump all of its heat on the bottom one.   Don't worry. 84 is well within safe limits(And Yes With The Acx Cooler You Most Likely Will Have To Run It As Fast ). But lower temps never hurts so you could check out a waterblock for the card/cards or buy a new chassi/fix your case flow.
nvidia,3deqle,sluflyer06,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:07:06 2015 UTC,"I'm ok with 80ish temps but running 80-90% fan speed worries me more, i guess i will just have to get used to that."

Also are you running stock fans or fans of your own choosing?  non-reference SLI setups are extremely problematic for temperature, they just dont' work well as there is too much super hot air blowing into the case.  I'm in the same boat but only until EK releases block."
nvidia,3deqle,ConsolePeasantNoMore,2,Wed Jul 15 18:34:31 2015 UTC,"Yes this is in game, If i run furmark it will shoot up to 85+. I will be getting a new case soon (enthoo luxe) with added fans so hopefully that will help a bit."

But here are some charts that can give you more info.  http://www.pcper.com/reviews/Systems/Quad-Core-Gaming-Hardware-Roundup/BioShock-Infinite-and-Civilization-Beyond-Earth  Honestly the only real bottleneck with a modern intel quad core CPU is at frame rates EXCEEDING 144hz, and if you turn up the graphics settings or play at a resolution over 1080p those disappear. You really should not have a CPU bottleneck unless you play games with horrible CPU scaling and optimization. Also you could overclock if you aren't getting 99% GPU usage but I would really be surprised to find out you had a CPU bottleneck at actually hurts your gaming experience.

So far in real world seems like the 980ti when oced a bit keeps up with or out performs my dual 780ti SLI setup. I'm sure there are a few cases where the SLI pair would eek out being a bit faster but you would be crippled on vram vs a 980ti.  Get the single card!

I beleive you also don't get a choice with the codec it uses (I haven't found an option for changing it yet and I've been using it since it came out).   If you're recording for professional play or want the crispest clips use another (albeit heavier) capture software.   If you're using it for 1080p youtube and need to save disk space use Shadowplay, the ability to buffer up to 20 minutes of gameplay is a godsend."
nvidia,3dei8b,Ohnae,2,Wed Jul 15 17:22:33 2015 UTC,"Alright, so 2 things.   Fans:  Most 980 Tis have a silent mode feature where the fans won't turn on until the board reaches 60C by default. So just because your fans aren't spinning doesn't mean something is wrong. As long as they turn on when the card gets hot your card is fine.  If you aren't happy with idle temps you can use something like MSI Afterburner to set a custom fan profile so the fans never turn off. But the cards are designed to be OK below 92C & throttle around 80C so never will get that hot.  Crashes:   The latest WHQL (official release) driver 353.30 has the same issue that has persisted since 352.86 where you get driver crashes with google chrome & in some games. To fix this you need to install the 353.38 hotfix driver that was released to specifically address the chrome crashes. You can find that driver here:  http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3694/~/geforce-hotfix-driver-353.38"

nvidia,3dei8b,pj530i,3,Wed Jul 15 17:52:09 2015 UTC,The fans probably won't turn on until the temps reach 50C.  The Silent and Stop lights are lit up because the fans are stopped and the card is in silent mode.

nvidia,3ddj8e,Leonick91,2,Wed Jul 15 14:04:55 2015 UTC,"If I were you I would wait to see how your current card handles at 1440p and to see how it performs with the newer APIs (Windows 10 launches on July 29th).  The gap between the 970 and the 7950 isn't massive but could be filled by another cards between in the future.  If the performance increase is worth the cost to you then go for it, after you are sure. Bare in mind that multi-GPU support should be far better in DX12 so XFire may be a good idea (as far as I know DX12 allows any GPU combo). Also take a look at the 390, most would argue it is better than the 970 for the same price, but go for whatever, if you choose to buy one. Hope it helps!"

nvidia,3de896,Wolfie3101,3,Wed Jul 15 20:29:19 2015 UTC,Their tech support not responding and then finally getting the card and saying it wasn't a failure it was user error and not fixing it stuff like that.   I also have a bad taste in my mouth from the Radeon 9800 days I believe when Asus used these stupid electronic circuit breaker type things. They would trip and drop the card into safe mode. And you couldn't get the card to return to stock speeds without shutting down and powering back up. Horrible design.
nvidia,3de896,FunktasticLucky,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:12:19 2015 UTC,"MSI, Asus, Powercolor, XFX and Gigabyte are all Chinese companies in Taipei and Chinese companies and they just do not value HR. From what I've heard it is a mixed bag dealing with these guys. Sometimes they will handle a warrantee normally, other times they will just dick you over and rake you over the coals and make it an adversarial process.  There was a thread...somewhere on reddit where a guy bought a 295 x 2 from one of these companies which had a cracked fan and coil whine. He was forced to literally make a video and send it over. They then tried to undercut him because his card ""depreciated"" then send him back the same card he sent them without fixing it. The entire process to RMA the card took 5 months and he was forced to go though Newegg to force a warantee. I've also heard some wild shit come out of asus as well, where they would refuse to honor guarantees for arbitrary reasons, often blaming consumers. I have to stress its not all bad stories and there are plenty of people who don't have any issues but it is more of a gamble dealing with the Chinese manufactures when things go south.  EVGA however is a California company. You pick up the phone now, call them and you will talking to some dude sitting in an office chair in CA in the next 10 min. They are generally super helpful and they have the best warantee in the business. In fact, they even allow you remove the custom cooler from their cards and just put it back on if you need to RMA it for whatever reason, this would void a lot of the other manufac. warantes. From personal experience I buy EVGA, their cards have worked flawlessly for me for years now and I've heard more than a few people who do comptuer service and repair that generally they have less problems with EVGA stuff."

nvidia,3dc8pm,Mobile_Lawnmower,2,Wed Jul 15 03:31:38 2015 UTC,"In the Nvidia Control Panel under Manage 3D Settings, there is an option for Monitor Technology that was recently added. Enable Gsync under that option. Lower down in the settings is Vertical Sync, if it is enabled it will only enable v-sync if your framerate is at the max refresh rate, if you turn that off then your framerates can go over the max refresh rate. Also make sure v-sync is off in-game so gsync will function"

nvidia,3ddmg2,Luckyduck1337,2,Wed Jul 15 13:16:19 2015 UTC,Is the 41c you say your CPU runs at idle or load?  According to open hardware monitor my g1 fans kick in at 57C. in games it typically maxes out at 72C but I have seen a temp of 73C once. I have an r5 with a d15 and 4 noctua a14 ULN case fans though.
nvidia,3ddmg2,Zarknox,2,Wed Jul 15 15:56:15 2015 UTC,"My CPU hits around 41C at load and then around 34C idle. It's OCd but I feel like the d15 is disipating a good deal of heat into the case likely, it's large, in order to keep the CPU cool.  I went ahead and ordered two NF-A14 iPPC-3000 fans for the top of the case. I feel like it couldn't hurt to push some of that hot air out the top.  In retrospect I should have just gone for a full size case. Maybe I'll go ahead and make the move one day."
nvidia,3ddmg2,Zarknox,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:24:55 2015 UTC,"hm wow. My cpu is anywhere from 31-35C idle but at load it gets around 57C on games. OH I think that would be due to having the low speed adapters on, ya that makes sense.  PS 74C is fine I think"
nvidia,3ddmg2,KaiForceOne,2,Wed Jul 15 16:45:54 2015 UTC,74C is well within safe temps and a great temp for this chip. I wouldn't bother with all those case changes.
nvidia,3ddmg2,p3dr0maz,2,Wed Jul 15 16:15:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed my MSI 980TI Gaming with good cooling would get 72c under Witcher 3 1440p 99% GPU load no vsync and fans @ 100%.  ASIC 71%  It actually scared me away from OC'ing and actually made the card throttle.  KrakenG10 bracket and Corsair H55 on there now and that's probably the best thing I ever did. Does'nt go over 57c now.  Added volts and pushed some 100Mhz more out of the core over stock, still tinketing."
nvidia,3ddmg2,Johnnyrodger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:02:53 2015 UTC,"The default fan curve for the G1 isn't good if your wanting to keep your card cool, only beneficial if you want it to run as silent as possible. http://i.imgur.com/nyIk0l4.png That is my custom fan curve, sits at around 60C @ 100% load."
nvidia,3ddmg2,Johnnyrodger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:16:38 2015 UTC,"Okay, thanks for the feedback. Seems like I'm not alone in feeling like the fan curve could use some adjustment.    Still seems like your fans are running at 50% at 100% load and keeping it at 60C, cooler than what I'm seeing."
nvidia,3ddmg2,attomsk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:33:51 2015 UTC,"Nah, they hover around 70-75% at full load."
nvidia,3ddmg2,attomsk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:25:27 2015 UTC,"That fan curve is a bit more aggressive than I run, my curve hits 70% fan at 72c.  I take it you are trying to keep the card running at 1.243v?"
nvidia,3ddmg2,attomsk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:07:10 2015 UTC,What speed are your case fans running at?  Do you have good ambient temps inside the case?  What is the pressure gradient like inside your case?  I can get DRASTICALLY different temps on my video card just by flipping two fans in my case and changing airflow directions.
nvidia,3dco9o,reyllo,3,Wed Jul 15 06:02:15 2015 UTC,"I think performance-wise there wouldn't be a huge difference. But you have to consider two things:   You already have one 980 so it would be cheaper to buy another one, however You have to know that SLI is not always beneficial compared to a single-card solution. I'm running two Gigabyte GTX 780 GHz and am going to transition to a 980 Ti soon because I want to move away from SLI for now. Mainly because of noise, temps and some incompatibilities with certain games (see HDR flicker for example).   So yeah, from a financial standpoint go SLI. But from a compatibility and all-round standpoint take the single card. But that's just my humble opinion"
nvidia,3dco9o,BaNaNaKING42,2,Wed Jul 15 06:44:54 2015 UTC,The general consensus I'm seeing is that it's better to have one amazing card rather than two lesser cards. Plus some games don't support SLI.
nvidia,3dco9o,therusskiy,0,Wed Jul 15 06:11:18 2015 UTC,"The going rate for 980s is 450 on ebay; a 980 ti is 650, so you'd safe 250 bucks by going the 980 ti route, with nearly identical performance."
nvidia,3dco9o,JJSCHMITTY,2,Wed Jul 15 06:12:29 2015 UTC,Yeah but he already has one 980 so it would be cheaper for him to buy another one
nvidia,3dco9o,BaNaNaKING42,5,Wed Jul 15 06:40:49 2015 UTC,"On what planet does SLI 980 has ""nearly identical"" performance?   It curbstomps a single 980 ti. The question OP should ask is if the increase in performance is worth losing 2GB vram and going from single to multi-card.  I have been using SLI for years and in my library there are only a few games that don't run well/support SLI and all those games can be maxed easily with a single 980.  Expect SLI to only improve in Windows 10 / DX 12 with better API support and lower overhead.  But if you are aiming 4k i'd say go 980 ti. But Reddit basicly seems to jerk-off to the 980ti forgetting the merrits of other cards."
nvidia,3dco9o,Gutterblade,2,Wed Jul 15 06:46:37 2015 UTC,"I ran 2 670s in SLI for a year, I always ran DDU before updating drivers and I never had issues with it. My only real problem with it was 2GB of vram wasn't enough for 1440p so I got rid of them and bought a 290x which had about the same performance but with double the vram.  Were there games that didn't support SLI? Yes, plenty of them. But if you actually know how to use Google you could easily find out most of these games you can force SLI with NVInspector and it will work fine most of the time.  I am convinced the majority of people saying don't use SLI never actually used it themselves and have no experience with it."
nvidia,3dco9o,hdshatter,-3,Wed Jul 15 09:13:42 2015 UTC,"It actually doesn't curbstomp a 980 Ti surprisingly. A decently overclocked 980 Ti was getting me around 22,000 on Firestrike and my highly overclocked watercooled 980 SLI was getting me 28,000.  Edit: Okay thanks for the downvotes."
nvidia,3dco9o,DrexelDragon93,0,Wed Jul 15 12:20:37 2015 UTC,Get the 980 Ti
nvidia,3dco9o,pogo_is_god,0,Wed Jul 15 06:40:10 2015 UTC,Single 980ti however its hard to recommend SLI until we get NVlink on pascal we don't have good GPU scaling. Fury X CF may be better than 980ti in dual configs.

nvidia,3dbae8,andrew5161,2,Tue Jul 14 23:03:01 2015 UTC,"As soon as a tech looks like it might have any chance of being a real thing, companies swarm in and patent everything reomotely related to it regardless of if they have any real working product.

nvidia,3dbae8,Put_It_All_On_Blck,2,Wed Jul 15 05:27:35 2015 UTC,"Seems like they are just after the patent to troll manufacturers in 50 years.   There are already pico projectors and projectors that are built into phones or in cases for them. We are far far away from having a worthwhile mobile projector setup. The things go through batteries extremely fast, the bulbs are delicate and need to be covered as oils and debris is terrible for them, they heat up which is terrible for batteries, the lumen and resolution will be low, etc."
nvidia,3dbae8,Rozenrot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:47:18 2015 UTC,"I work with projectors for a living and this isn't something that will be viable for a very, very long time.  Even the smallest pico-projectors are low resolution, hot, power hungry things. You'll not see a projector in your phone for years if not a decade or more.  Personally I wouldn't hold my breath for it ever happening, because the applications are almost none, and most people will see this is gimmicky as hell."
