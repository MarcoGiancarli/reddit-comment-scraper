With parts that take no less than four hours to print on my quadruped project, for example, I was able to design and print out the entire thing in about a day or two (will make a post about it when I finish programming it).  Unless you have your own laser cutter or machining tools with a large supply of material, even taking into account that plastic is a better material in many applications than wood, acrylic, or metal, you won't be making things (that fit in your printing volume) as quickly as a printer will, and you won't have the freedom to modify your design to suit your needs as often as you like.  The most unusual print I've seen was one of my own failed overnight prints - a print for a bunch of small-scale amusement park rides that took up a good percentage of my build plate. The end result was a very small, hard, congealed blob of melted plastic with a shiny shell similar to an acetone-smoothed part; wish I still had it. Not really a good example to assuage your disappointment, but it's important to remember that 3D printing is far from failure-proof. Looking in your comment history, I see that someone said a watchface should have been laser cut; consider that something worn every day like a watch would hopefully be made of the most durable materials possible, and that a printed part was completely unnecessary to include except to claim that their product was '3D printed'. I guess 'laser cut' isn't cool anymore."

Think about it, if someone has an idea for a new invention but getting it made via CNC or something would cost $2k but a 3D print would only be $200, and they absolutely do not have $2k lying around for a random idea prototype, then for all intents and purposes that product will not exist without 3D printing."

You've done the hard work and got a good customer base and (what seems to be) a decent reputation.  In this field I found that in order to turn it into a legitimate full time job you need to alter your prices to certain customers. Get them in by being affordable and then once you prove your quality, speed and professionalism, you can bump up the prices. Customers will be reluctant to go with another supplier as it can be an expensive exercise only to find out they should have stayed with you from the start and they will fully understand it is a job, not a hobby.  Few people will take a risk to cut costs on some hobbyist who does it on the side, vs someone who raises their prices and does 3D printing as a career path."

Less warpage from drafts etc.  Are you using 2020 extrusion? I'm working on a tighter fitting enclosure for mine at the moment that attaches to the 2020 in the corners. Both to ease transport and to increase chamber temperatures (less volume)
3Dprinting,3e0oa4,Verdigrie,2,Tue Jul 21 11:30:09 2015 UTC,Yes warping is down. It also really helps cut down noise. and I don't like breathing in ABS fumes :P  Yeah those are 2020s. That would be pretty cool! Do you have a delta style or (xyz style?)
3Dprinting,3e0oa4,Verdigrie,2,Tue Jul 21 13:17:23 2015 UTC,"Ah the cut down on noise is beautiful isn't it? I placed some rubber and foam underneath mine and can happily sleep in the same room as it now.  As for the smell, I haven't used any ABS yet myself. Do you have a heated bed? I quite like the sweet smell of the PLA, however if ABS is anything like the fumes from plastic welding I'll be glad of the enclosure :)  I have a delta Kossel 2020 too.

Hot glue feet sound like a great idea! I might have to steal that for when I'm travelling with the printer and don't carry my foam base.  You should get great results with the new hot end.

3Dprinting,3dyiq6,Skellyton5,3,Tue Jul 21 08:18:15 2015 UTC,Certain ABS is considered food safe by the FDA. BUT that does not take into account the manufacturing difference in FFF printers vs the typical mold based parts.  A very known side effect of extrusion through a heated nozzle is that it produces zillions of micro-particles that enter the environment (bad to breath) and coat the part in copious quantities.  More heat will release them.  The science on the micro-particles is pretty solid and documented though I am unaware of any specific scientific paper on this.  I know there are industry papers on this subject and will locate them when I have a chance.

EDIT: I've spent the last hour researching this and I have found page after page saying that It is dangerous when: It's made at the factory, Long term exposure to printing and can burn when melted. Other than some Broscience comments that it's toxic I haven't found a single article that says it's harmful when in a solid form. The pigment/dye I'm not sure, but from what I've found I'll comfortably eat and drink from (acetone sealed) ABS plasticware for many years to come.  Here's another one for good measure.

3Dprinting,3e1opt,Dycus,2,Tue Jul 21 07:26:50 2015 UTC,Looks like your z-stop is indeed too high. The plastic should smoosh against the bed slightly in the first layer. The bottom shouldn't really have any gaps in it.

3Dprinting,3e1opt,lumpy_potato,3,Tue Jul 21 07:58:45 2015 UTC,You may need a higher temp at higher speeds to help the plastic flow better. A better extruder assembly may also help. Even 5 or 10 c can make a difference.   Also that part seems like it has layers that would take less than a minute each -  check your cooling settings.  Slic3r for instance has a setting to slow layers less than X seconds. Maybe check that and bump it up to shave some time off your print

3Dprinting,3dvy0e,SaLESaLE,34,Sun Jul 19 23:55:45 2015 UTC,"Something that huge, you really shouldn't print in ABS/HIPS unless you have an enclosure.  ABS is much better for mechanical/structural parts where you need more precise tolerances, flexing, or impact strength- but it's not good for large parts as it tends to crack.  PLA is great for large parts as it always adheres great and never cracks like that.  It has trouble with fine details, overhangs, shattering under load, and direct sunlight.    PET/PETG/PET+ is a bit of the best of both worlds, but is quite expensive.  Last I checked the cheapest was $35/lb.  Versus PLA @ $12/lb and ABS @ $10/lb.  EDIT: PETG is slightly cheaper (for whatever reason). Found it for $15/lb.  EDIT 2: The one downside is PET-based plastics is they are EXTREMELY difficult to glue/weld. Whereas abs you can glue multiple small pieces together to make one big piece with just acetone easily. Both PLA and ABS respond well to methylene chloride based glues such as scigrip 16, or standard epoxies, PET is polyethylene based and epoxy (as well as most glues) have a difficult time grabbing on to it."

I had some issues with the last 1/4 roll of clear being tangled but the other 4 rolls have been just fine and I just unspooled and respooled the clear and it was fine.

But generally, as long as you follow the manual, calibrating is pretty simple and then it's just turning 3 screws until you get the Z height perfect. The two ABS fan shrouds it has you make came out came out really well. A few more crap starts with PLA and I might convert to ABS.  But I have like 8 spools of PLA, so probably I'll fight it until I get it right or run out."
3Dprinting,3dw3jg,wensul,4,Mon Jul 20 10:23:49 2015 UTC,"SeeMeCNC filament, bed @60C, and really get that first layer squish right, and you should see good bed adhesion. Add a skirt 3mm and that helps too. Supports need purple elmers glue.  That first layer squish makes a huge difference - you can use G0 Z0 to send the hotend down (heated appropriately, bed hot too), and then do the paper test and change the Z=0 level from there without having to use the knob to send it down."
3Dprinting,3dw3jg,fmdx,2,Tue Jul 21 01:11:43 2015 UTC,"That sounds pretty sweet.  The build volume is amazing, and the price is quite attractive.  The Afinia has a selector for PLA / ABS temps, between 200C and 260 C, and I think there is a new software update that allows you to manually enter the temp you want.  For me, I only use Afinia premium filament (ABS), mostly so I don't have to spend a lot of time diddling and cleaning clogged nozzles.

I created a CAD version of the CMS detector, one of the experiments on the LHC at CERN.  I did it in my spare time for fun.  (I am a CMS collaborator.)  Well, one of the outreach coordinators at Fermilab asked if I could produce 70 of them - one for every US CMS institute (50) and a few VIPs (DOE/NSF management).  So then I had to figure out how to produce 70 of them.  Tons of work."

Pause points are determined in CAD as distance in mm from bottom layer to stop point.  Points are entered as a string concatenated with commas.""

3Dprinting,3dw3jg,MuckYu,6,Mon Jul 20 01:35:01 2015 UTC,"Definitely takes patience.  It's pretty insane in the shop when I run these parts.  I'm running batches of 25 models, so I need 25 of these parts for each order.  Each individual print takes 3 hours, so I try to pile it up on one day of misery, and do 4 sets of 6 in a row.  I make heavy use of the 480's ""print again"" feature, so it doesn't need to resend the part to the printer, just starts printing instantly.  I just swab a new layer of glue stick on the surface and it's good to go.  That also means that each printer finishes each color layer at pretty much the same time, so I'm like a mad man cutting the old color at the top of the extruder, and feeding in the new color, trying to do it before the next one finishes...and so on...and so forth........repeat ad nauseum."
3Dprinting,3dw3jg,theprophet84,4,Mon Jul 20 02:18:19 2015 UTC,"The first printer was funded by Fermilab as part of a small grant I wrote to make just one model.  After that, they liked it so much they decided to purchase 70 of them (at least).  I am selling to anyone that wants one, for $275 each, and the remaining 5 printers I purchased myself.  To change the filament, it will pause where you specify, and you can either withdraw the existing filament and extrude a new color, or do what I do, and simply cut the filament at the top of the extruder, click ""resume"" in the software, and feed the new color in behind the old color.  For these parts, the color change happens within the model during the ""fill"", so you can't tell when it rainbows through purple between red and blue, for example."

But since I'm a physicist I have to be a bit pedantic, the LHC (large hadron collider) is the machine that actually accelerates the protons (hadrons).  This is a model of the CMS detector (compact muon solenoid), and it's the thing that sees what happens when the protons collide!  ATLAS is another detector like CMS, and CMS is 'competing' with ATLAS to announce the next discovery first, or with greater precision.  A little competition keeps us honest."

3Dprinting,3dxlvj,someonestolemycar,2,Mon Jul 20 18:20:58 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/a/csrpu#0 Have at you! Mine is a lot more complicated though (frankly too complicated, was a nightmare to make and I'm still not done) Entire top is removable on pegs, rear solid wall is fixed and will have plastic spools, PSU, RPi, Ramps and a fan or two will be on the back of it. Bottom compartment is for storage of solvents, juices and adhesives and some plastic.  The plexi is inset into the legs and table top using cut slits, (a mistake looking back, though it does hide my crappy cuts, I have no idea how to cut plastic accurately and with clean lines) I'm using a door on hinges with a lot of printed hardware around it (still some missing including the knob/handle, most of the trim around it, stops etc) made a tray in the top as well for the LED strip to go in, going to make a cover/diffuser out of clear filament to cover it up.  It's one of those projects you get where you think is halfway and you realize you've bitten off way more than you can chew, but you're already halfway to stopping would be a waste, but in reality I was more like 10% done with it at that point...  Frankly your version looks like a lot less of a slog to make, though aren't you limiting your z axis? I did the measurements on my i3 and without raising the legs of the table some my extruder motor would hit the table top at about 160mm~ and I currently have about 197mm~ Got a fun surprise when I cut the legs from the other table I bought and realized they're just a square tube of cardboard with wooden plugs at the ends, luckily I had wood the perfect dimensions to slip inside the tube, screwed them in place in the end against the plug and sawed the combination off flush on the miter saw. (Well, somewhat flush, I'll need to spend a lot of time with sand paper, putty and paint to make this thing look decent...)"
3Dprinting,3dxlvj,KriLL3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:15:55 2015 UTC,"Your project reminds me of how mine started - I cut it back due to time to builkd (which would be time not printing, as I used the tables the printer was currently sat on!) and how adventurous I was feeling. I can't say I'm not jealous that I didn't have the guts to go through with it though. Good luck!  In regards to Z-=axis, no, I don't lose any height - could be my i3 sits a little lower than yours, also I'm using a direct drive extruder, so it has a lot less height itself.  I know what you mean about the Lack's interior though - they are definitely made to be cheap! I considered putting some expanding foam in the pilot holes for the screws, to give them more to grip, but it wasn't necessary with liberal application of epoxy.  And my plastic cutting isn't that great either - the silicone hides the sins!"

His portable circle saw again has a blade meant for wood I'm sure but it works a lot better, problem is that you need to set it up so that the plastic you're cutting can't move and the saw slides along a guide of some sort, even so you end up with a lot of wavyness from slightly shifting how you push on it even with the metal guard thing on the bottom, his reciprocating saw works quite well for details but it tends to dance around a bit and it's a bit hard to saw using painted lines on the anti-scratch liner when the saw tends to rip off the liner, I had to buy some cable channel stuff to hide the bottom edges of my side panels since they don't slot into slots because the top part is removable, and I'm going to have to print a lot of extra trim around the door to hide the pretty narly lines, even after sanding."
3Dprinting,3dxlvj,KriLL3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:07:05 2015 UTC,"I have the ""luxuary"" of having the printer itself being elsewhere while I work on the enclosure, has meant I've dilly-dallied a lot though, I intended to complete the enclosure in like a week (been 2 months so far...) and had set up the printer ""temporarily"" on the desk in my bedroom, which means I can't print while I'm asleep, the bedding smells awful funny (I'm washing it regularly) and it's in the way of all my electronics stuff like my soldering iron etc. Here is my current super messy ""temporary"" setup: http://imgur.com/a/yzUIz#0 Idea was to set it up like that so I could print stuff I wanted to print right of the bat, and print upgrades and parts for the enclosure etc, was never meant to last this long which is why I never really made an attempt at making it tidy. Features my no-patent-pending z-brace.  Yeah I'm using a geared setup with the motor ending up perched far above the rest, though I wonder if I actually should or not, reading around it seems geared is intended to be used with weaker steppers to allow lower weight on the x axis, but I got a pretty big stepper up there, probably works direct, but I don't have the right parts for that atm, I'd need a feeding wheel thing for the motor (only got a hobbed bolt) and print a extruder for it. I can see a direct setup fitting under the table unmodified.  On the topic of wiring btw I'm making cable chains for mine, I can't find em cheaper than the plastic cost of printing them, going to put on going from the left Z motor to the X motor and one from the X motor to the extruder motor, in front of the z rods, I've seen people put it between the z rods and frame but then you limit your z a bit since the cable chain/cables/mount thing hits the z tops.  When I cut the legs on the miter saw my first thought ""huh, that was easy"" then looked at the cut end and realized why XD Also remembered the properties of the LACK stuff after I put on the table top on the rear, I wanted to fix it in place initially using those printed brackets you can see on the rear wall, and sure enough that fixed it in place, until I tried moving it from lying on the back piece... Turns out screws through cardboard aren't awfully structural, had to screw through the wooden pieces in the corners, and I'll have to add chipboard/MDF to the back of the back wall screwed into the 4 wood corners to be able to mount stuff on the back... I left the brackets and screws to cover the holes held in place with glue, but I doubt they're actually contributing to the structural strength...  I didn't spot the silicon around the edges at first, I didn't want to do that because of the somewhat cludgy look of seeing it from the other side, though looking back that was probably a mistake, I thought the plastic would just sit nicely in the cut grooves somehow but boy was I wrong, if they're narrow enough to grip the plastic well to make a friction fit work you can't slide them through to install them (duh) when I opened up the slits a bit to let the plastic slide in they fit very loosely and rattled around, my cludgy fix was super glue all the corners, which works but there is some glue visible in places, considering printing some brackets to screw through similar to yours which would also hide the glue residue.

I assume there will be a lot of strength needed when the key is being turned. p.s thanks for you help, i was actually able to find the exact housing I needed. (Turns out, i'm not the only one who sat on their keys and broke the housing)"
3Dprinting,3e1c41,S00rabh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:27:23 2015 UTC,I would recommend as high a temperature plastic as possible.  Depending on where you are located the interior car temperature could easily approach the point at which your print becomes soft and useless.    The other option is to find someone with an SLA printer such as a form 1 or B9 as these plastics are thermoset and will burn in preference to melting.

3Dprinting,3e1c41,Gooch_scratcher,2,Tue Jul 21 08:09:26 2015 UTC,"The reason it's so expensive is because it has an immobiliser chip inside it.  Basically if you try and start the key without that chip near the ignition column the car will think it's being stolen.  There are a number of work arounds including taping the chip to the underside of the column and just having a ""dumb"" key although your insurance might take issue with this if the car was stolen.    You can usually find new housings on ebay for peanuts.  I would check there out first."

If the motor is getting hot, get a fan on it and see if your board has a potentiometer so you can turn down the power a bit. If ABS has been working, probably you are just too hot at the hotend."

3Dprinting,3dztt1,mushoo,4,Mon Jul 20 23:16:04 2015 UTC,"Both would likely burn (and thus clog your extruder irreparably) at the nozzle. Superglue would likely harden on it's own over time, and epoxy would have a similar issue - as well as being exothermic, thus expanding, heating, and cracking your filament.  Finding a 'liquid' that doesn't burn/evaporate at the temps we require for extruding (plus, you'd need it to match temps with the outer shell), while still solidifying after exposure to air, AND having an interesting/useful property, seems like a tall order.  Anything sufficiently liquid (you'd probably rather some kind of gel) would drain the moment you snipped the filament to load something else.  Anything that solidifies via air exposure would solidify slowly over time, eventually rendering the filament useless.    Best use I could think of for this would be a filament with an olive oil core, for seasoning an extruder (it's handy with PLA).  Oil core would be useless for actual printing though, as nothing would bond through it."
3Dprinting,3dztt1,printedsolid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:09:35 2015 UTC,"There are some filaments sort of like this.  The most similar is the cleaning filaments that are a coextrusion of two different materials.  You have a thin core of an active cleaning material with another polymer around it.    Then you have the filled materials (wood, metal, etc) and some of the kai parthy materials (layfoam, etc) that have a dissolvable material mixed in a matrix of something else.    My first reaction is that an actual liquid core probably isn't going to work, but maybe you could have a core of another polymer with significantly different properties for cool effects.  Maybe something like a low durometer TPE like ninjaflex with a hard 'candy' shell of something like a PLA.  I imagine if you could get the ratio of stiff to flexible material, you could get an easy to print / push highly flexible filament."

3Dprinting,3dylv0,Keebie81,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:37:26 2015 UTC,watch that the big gear doesnt stop moving. if it does the set screw for the small gear might not be tight enough.  also make sure the filament idler tension is tight enough and that the hobbed bolt is pulling filament in.

Weren't my favorite filaments. They work. That's about all I can say about them. Sometimes the diameter would go down and it is noticeable on a layer or two on a tall print.  -(translucent) Red/Orange: Great quality. Amazing diameter consistency. Looks like candy when printed. Sometimes the shiny, translucent look isn't desired.  -(Dark solid) Blue: Was supposed to arrive as translucent blue. Amazon screwed up or the page was wrong about the color and advertized picture. Came with dust on the outside of the filament on the spool. Prints good, I guess. Unhappy it wasn't the pretty translucent blue I wanted, but wanted to try it.

Has clogged my hot end once when I went below 210c. :/ Was a #$# to clean out.  Ninjaflex  -dark red(?): Will not work in a bowden extruder, ever. Requires a special extruder design to keep it from bending and wrapping around the feeder gear as it is so elastic and flexible, droopy. Needs slower printer speeds. Layers very often tend to de-laminate under bending and stress if the layers are not fine and haven't fused well. Strings like crazy, retraction can't help. Doesn't do over-hangs well. These issues don't really matter though, because it was the only flexible filament I could get, and the flexible property is novel enough. I hear semi-flex is better in all departments, if not a tad less flexible, haven't had a chance to buy any yet.

Get a couple of metal plates and place them on top of one another (with a constant distance in between), then get out a multimeter and measure the capacitance (C_no_plastic). If your multimeter is not good enough to measure that low a value you could setup a simple RC circuit and charge up the plates/capacitor to a known voltage (Vs), connect it to a resistor (R), and then measure how long it takes for the voltage to fall to ~0.63Vs (T). To calculate the capacitor value simply use: C_no_plastic = T(in sec)/R(in ohms). Then print out a sheet of plastic to fit in between the metal plates and place it in there, after this measure the resulting capacitance value (C_with_plastic).  Once you have your two capacitance values its very simple to calculate the dielectric constant, simply divide the C_with_plastic by C_no_plastic.  NOTE: The downside of this method is that it gives you the dielectric constant at a single frequency which may/may not be the one the client wishes to operate at.

3Dprinting,3dvue8,elmoret,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:32:13 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, you're hawking a design with pretty obvious flaws at a spendy (for hobby machines) price point to a community that's known for rolling its own solutions using free designs with members that have access to a machine that can create its own parts for almost nothing.  Given most of these people are running their RepRaps in their homes for giggles, and it takes 20 minutes to print $0.40 worth of material and 10 minutes max to swap, you have to go through a lot of gears before $50 is worthwhile to your average RepRap user ignoring any weight problems. Even valuing your machine hobby time at $20/hr, you have to go through 3 gear sets before it's close to break even; if you sit there babysitting the machine. If you print a batch of them, all-but-ignore the print, and set them aside, it's around a dozen sets before the break even point. Most of us don't print that much and those that do aren't using RepRap machines.  You're also coming across pretty hostile to valid feedback, which isn't winning you any points in the community. I'd say if you're serious, fab one up that's close to a final product (thinner, near hollow, herringbone teeth, etc) and then ask for feedback. And yes, there are already gears out there that match the specs for cheaper. According to some quick Googling, metal pinion gears run $6 to $15 and the larger gears run $15 to $25; so at worst you're still $10 more expensive."

If you are talking about commercial 3D printing options, things like hot-ends, extruders, controller boards, haven't really changed much. The slicing software has improved a lot but those are usually free updates. The whole point of having a 3D printer is that it can update itself with the latest upgrades."

Any changes have been mostly on the software side so as long as you get a decently built one that follows open standards (RAMPS, etc), you'll be good for a long time and can probably easily add any future improvements to it.  For other 3D technologies, that hasn't really been established yet. Being in its infancy means lots of stuff hasn't been proven or replaced yet. Most SLA printers can use nearly any resin, SLS can use almost any plastic powder (or metal powder depending on design), etc. There's not really much of an upgrade force in the industry yet except for increased business utility causing a business to upgrade to the next most expensive machine; unless you're talking specialty materials on the very cutting edge of the tech like carbon fiber."

Take a look at Make magazine's 3d printing guides and this printer generally performs in a $ category that's about $500-$1000 beyond its own price. It seems to be an anomaly. I also think its a wonderful printer to start with since you get to see so much of it work, and will have to spend time getting your settings just right with your slicer and control software. I've learned a lot using it. Finally, its also amenable to modification- I've printed a different fan vent, and installed a better fan. Others have done a lot more. Beyond the bed size issue (which might be a limiting factor once you grow in competence and confidence), I'd wholeheartedly recommend it as a first printer."

3Dprinting,3du6sr,Goldensword,4,Sun Jul 19 14:43:17 2015 UTC,"First, stop looking at the manufacturer's listed spec for minimum layer thickness. This is a worthless specification unless it is artificially limited by the software, which on the two printers you listed there are no artificial limits on machine performance. The only other difference in minimum feature size (not resolution, that doesn't make sense on an FDM printer) is the nozzle size. There may be some difference here between the two, but it is a relatively cheap thing to swap a nozzle to a different size ($10-$20 typically). The next thing to talk about is surface finish. A large part of this is the stiffness and dimensional stability  of the printer frame. The Lulzbot Mini is a steel frame with high quality motion components and is close to the stiffest most dimensionally stable frame you can get."

FDM fabrication is not a perfect process, it relies on plastic literally being squished onto a previous layer so there is lots of error in the extrusion and shrinkage alone (corner's aren't sharp either). Then there are mechanical movement components not being perfectly accurate.   To top it off, when a CAD program saves an stl file. A round circle is not actually round, the underlying geometry is a multifaceted polygon that approximates a circle.   Better to engineer in some room for error and imperfections than to pull your hair out trying to get that bit of precision out of a machine that was never designed to be that precise."

I have one that is x=25.15mm , y=25.45mm, z=25.6mm             What this means is that I have to SHRINK the dimensions by the amount of difference.  If z is supposed to be 25mm, but it is instead 25.6mm, then if I divide 25/25.6, I get .977.

Even in your best case scenario of 5.15mm, if you were printing something 100mm long, your correction factor of 0.971 means you are going to print a part 102.99mm long."
3Dprinting,3dsy4m,vaderj,-1,Sun Jul 19 17:01:06 2015 UTC,"I did make a mistake - I measure the entire assembly, which is actually supposed to be 25mm x 25mm. Either way, the process has worked good enough to create many functional prints"
3Dprinting,3dsy4m,DBrowny,2,Sun Jul 19 19:26:55 2015 UTC,"Its still not a good idea though.  If you want to calibrate it by doing your method, print a 100x100 square. It doesnt have to be tall, even 5mm tall will do it, but you are still drastically over-compensating by setting your calibration via a 25mm piece.  You should never have to apply a correction factor of 2.9% to PLA of all thigs. ABS is more like 2%, PLA should be less. If you printed a 100x100 square im fairly sure you would find the correction factor to be more like 0.995."
3Dprinting,3dsy4m,vaderj,-1,Mon Jul 20 03:27:57 2015 UTC,"You are making the assumption that the only correction required is for the thermal contraction. Every printer is going to have an error value on each axis, which when you print the calibration cube, you get a good enough approximation. Most build pads are relatively small, so getting a rough estimate from a 15 minute print job is accurate enough. If you require higher accuracy, 3d printing via FDM is probably the wrong manufacturing process for the piece"
3Dprinting,3dsy4m,DBrowny,3,Mon Jul 20 05:16:06 2015 UTC,"No no no  The error value you are getting is true, but it does not scale with size! Yes printers will have an error on each axis, but if your printer is even worth using, this error is going to be an absolute error (+/- 0.2mm) and not a relative error (+/- 2%).  If your printer is consistently printing parts 2.9% smaller than it should, you don't have thermal contraction issues, you have a step/mm issues and this needs to be fixed via firmware/tightening the belts etc and not by applying correction factors. Trying to compensate for inaccurate prints by just scaling the model does nothing to solve the problem that is causing your prints to be the wrong size.  A +0.15mm tolerance on a 25mm part is honestly really good, id take that any day. If you tried to correct that by increasing the model by 2.9%, you are going to end up printing large parts oversized and this can be completely avoided by not scaling the model, and instead calibrating the printer correctly. Don't fix the model, fix your printer. You cant print a calibration piece and then use that to scale future models. The entire purpose is to calibrate your printer, not to generate some fudge factor for the STLs."

At least it was for me with my bulldog lite extruder. Moving in increments of .1mm, 1/16 steps or 1/32 steps, made it skip with minimal pressure in the drive gear. WITH no hot end.  Now I understand why geared extruders are used such as Wade's Geared,  or Bulldog XL.  I hope this doesn't happens to x and y axis. I've never seen this issue on my xy axis with 1/16 steps. As you said, you don't see a problem reaching that speed with belts."

That said, if I push by hand, the PTFE tubing starts to float up - I think that its strongly pointing to the issue being volume flow through the nozzle. Maybe I really do have to stick to 210C...but its been OK so far! Can't quite understand the sudden change instead of things failing right away  One thing - the EZStruder bites the PLA, which then kind of drags on the PTFE.

3Dprinting,3drhqv,matteatschicken,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:10:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry, the extruded stepper driver was turned down. At 180° I lowered the voltage until it stopped extruding then upper it 1/4 turn. 20 min into a print and the extruder motor doesn't feel too hot, maybe 30° or so."

3Dprinting,3dq4zx,ionparticle,2,Sat Jul 18 14:56:01 2015 UTC,You're right the schematic layout does look very similar to the Sanguinololu board. It's more than likely built off that. Thanks for the help in identifying it.  Edit: It looks like it is actually a MKS Mini board. Identical layout and components.  The kit only came with the extruder fan. I gather it's going to be in my interest to put on some heat sinks and a fan to cool those stepper motor controller chips? Unfortunately the board is mounted underneath the build plate so a fan might mess with the temperature of the build plate and cause issues. Not sure how to handle that.
3Dprinting,3dq4zx,Daelith,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:12:57 2015 UTC,"Interesting, never seen that board before.  In my experience, stepper drivers actually run pretty cool when they're adjusted correctly.

Deltas know how many steps off of the limit switches the build plate is. If it's not reaching the build plate, you have to change the MANUAL_Z_HOME_POS value in the firmware."

I think I've identified the board as an MKS Mini and I'll have a look at the setting you mentioned. Thanks."

3Dprinting,3dpdrb,engineerd3d,3,Sat Jul 18 05:44:58 2015 UTC,I would thicken up the lip. Then print in abs. The tungsten abs I used in one of my videos would definitely be a better option. The only downside is cost.
3Dprinting,3dpdrb,DBrowny,2,Sat Jul 18 06:24:43 2015 UTC,"It's a cool use for printing, but I think that design needs a change before the materials do. I would expect the same failure with ABS from a similar impact that did that."
3Dprinting,3dpdrb,DBrowny,2,Sat Jul 18 05:15:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking about that. It would have more strength if the layers weren't parallel to the direction of force, but printing this upright would mean a lot of support material. I wanted to add chamfers to the ""wall"" but it wouldn't fit under the board.   Know how I could strengthen this?"
3Dprinting,3dpdrb,miker95,5,Sat Jul 18 05:44:13 2015 UTC,I think printing it upright is going to make a significant difference. It would use more support material but I cant think of a way to make it more stronger which doesn't involve making the part far thicker. That would lose the look of the part and it would be kind of blocky though.
3Dprinting,3dpdrb,5TATAA3,2,Sat Jul 18 05:51:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, the only options I thought about were thickening the ""bumper"" or printing vertically. Maybe a small piece of aluminum inserted into the print would do the trick."

3Dprinting,3dpdrb,astromek,2,Sat Jul 18 07:09:16 2015 UTC,"The direction of the layers. If you print like I did with the layers going against gravity, then the direction of force when this collides with something is perpendicular to the layers. That means the space between layers are failure points and the print is way easier to break. Printing with the layers in the direction of the force would improve the strength."
3Dprinting,3dpdrb,The_Original_One,2,Sat Jul 18 08:34:13 2015 UTC,"It looks like the front of your board takes a huge amount of force (hence the busted plywood). Some cars have body designs that crush deliberately on impact, absorbing force. Have you considered designing the noseguard to crush on purpose? Maybe make it a little thicker than it is now, but hollow with medium infill. Since you can print it you could just replace it when you need to."

3Dprinting,3dp0zv,tommygunz007,3,Sat Jul 18 02:06:36 2015 UTC,"I don't have one, but I can answer a couple of those questions maybe.   The largest part the form1 can print is a 4.9"" x 4.9"" x 6.5"" part, which is not considered large in the 3d printing world. A bottle of the printing resin costs $146 for 1 Liter on average, and you need a new resin tank after every 2 bottles at $59 each according to the manufacturer. That is orders of magnitude more expensive than a fillament printer. There are likely cheaper sources for the resins, but it's still considered a more expensive facet of the hobby The light based resin printers are generally much more accurate at the smallest levels than the fillament printers. You generally see them used for parts that require a high degree of precision, but not a whole lot of strength, though there is a new resin on the marketplace that claims similar strength to ABS plastic extruded parts. People use them for things like making mold cores for small jewelry and other fine detail parts, or for making one off custom parts that require a high degree of precision (lab environment parts for experement rigs, etc.)  I don't own one so I'm going to decline to rate it."
3Dprinting,3dp0zv,piercet_3dPrint,2,Sat Jul 18 05:57:58 2015 UTC,"Not really expensive, maybe by hobbyist standards.  Big prints tend not to be solid, so often aren't much more expensive than small prints that need a bunch of support.  We find the resin tanks don't last 2 litres for us, but we suspect that's because we often print big things that accelerate wear in a single spot.  We use probably a litre of propan-2-ol a month for the cleaning tanks, which is maybe $10. Wind tunnel models, molds, adaptor plates, mounting plates.  Often just anything that needs to be custom made but doens't need to be metal and can't be done on a laser cutter.  Industry is aerospace research, yes I like it. 4/5.  Does exactly what it says on the tin, software is fairly idiot proof.  Higher accuracy, less shrinkage, and better wearing resin tanks would be nice."
3Dprinting,3dp0zv,votingprawn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:29:54 2015 UTC,"I would say the biggest disadvantage is how messy it is. When the print is finished it is completely covered in liquid resin. You take the part off and now you have resin all over your hands and then you put it into the acetone bath, and then the box for the acetone bath has resin all over it.  tl;dr Too messy for inside the house. Messy enough for the Garage. Beautiful print quality though."

3Dprinting,3dlz87,ShadowRam,2,Fri Jul 17 13:05:41 2015 UTC,"Stepper motors draw more power than the Arduino can supply, so you need intermediate circuitry to run them - the Arduino uses its 3.3 or 5 volts to toggle the intermediate circuit's (usually) 12 volts directed to the motor.

They're circuits that allow you to run current either way across, say, a motor, allowing you push it forwards or in reverse just by flipping the state of a couple of switches."

Parts will be subject to heat if one decides to close off the sides or build an enclosure to maintain high temperatures. All I'm seeing is that Altuglas is heavily marketed as high impact which isn't the most important aspect of whats necessary in a frame. Rigidity, vibration dampening, and how it handles prolonged exposure to high heat would be."
3Dprinting,3dm4hj,dezign,2,Fri Jul 17 19:03:25 2015 UTC,"There's no way that enclosure gets up near 94C. If it does, the steppers will fail long before the acrylic does. Again, heat is not an issue.  Altuglas is marketed as high impact because that's the biggest weakness of acrylic, and it was overcome with additives to the polymer... so this makes the marketing. Rigidity comes less from the material and more from the design. Same story with damping."
3Dprinting,3dm4hj,elmoret,3,Fri Jul 17 19:07:25 2015 UTC,"94C is when is when Atuglas ultimately fails.

Also on the Kickstarter page, the chip samples of the acrylic is branded with ""Perspex Impressions"". Paging /u/SanjayM do you happen to have a better, more thorough explanation and confirmation of the exact frame material you are using? Also have you guys put the material through rigorous torture tests such as baking the material in an oven, letting it cool, and repeating this process numerous times, and measure out before and after readings of the material to see if there is any warping utilizing digital calipers/indicators or scientific tools."
3Dprinting,3dm4hj,dezign,5,Fri Jul 17 20:50:16 2015 UTC,"And I thought I was a real hardcore resin-specific plastic nerd.  Mitsubishi plastic people just so happen to provide nice photogenic colour chips that look great on kickstarter, don't read into it too much.  Thermal cycling, not really fussed. PMMA doesn't care about the sort of temperatures we're going see, even slightly. No torture testing required. What I will be testing is more relevant stuff like crack resistance, flexural modulus, and how it makes the marketing girl feel when she looks at the colour chart.  I'm honestly not sure sure which exact resin grade we'll use. But I live, breathe and sometimes accidentally eat polymers. Altuglas has some pretty good shit, as do Mitsubishi and Plexiglas. But it will be the right stuff for the job at hand, with a considered choice based on a decent understanding of the actual material science."

Why would they put anything in an oven? Even enclosed in a 14""x14""x14"" enclosure with the heated bed at 110C, the temperature inside my enclosure doesn't break 40C. This printer, as shipped, will work just fine. If you want to add a heater to the enclosure and take it up to 100C then sure it might not be suitable, but it also isn't suitable to put a 200 shot of nitrous oxide on a stock Honda Civic. Doesn't mean Civics aren't great cars.  Take your pick of Altuglas flavors, they'all have continuous operating temperatures of at least 40C. With regard to that, it doesn't matter which one they end up with. But yes, hopefully Sanjay can chime in shortly. From my experience the first 24 after a KS launch are very busy."

Right now it's actually hard to find)  Got some comments on the linked article:   Sanjay and the team are planning to get the dual head machine also working as directly mounted extruder’s during the final stages of refinement on this printer design.   It would be interesting to have a modular design. Have the motor mount and extruder attachable to the carriage in a direct drive setup, and also have them mountable somewhere on the frame for a bowden setup.  E3D already have bowden conversion kits (little metal discs with a bowden coupling to turn ""any"" extruder in to a  bowden) and their hot ends come in a universal version. Include a mounting point in the design and you've got a nice feature built in. Very useful if you do stuff like print ninjaflex (really, really needs direct drive) and then later want to push out some rigid plastic quickly.   dual stainless steel M6 rods   Is that threaded rod as in something like this? Threaded rod made for fastening things together is indeed cheaper than rods made for linear motion, but the swarm of Reprap / Repstrap machines made over the years tend to show it as not the best solution. In my case, Id be worried about the rods being easier to bend, both along the length of the rod and on the threads themselves in the event of anything rough happening to the Z axis. It also conflicts with the kickstarter claim of:   No expense has been spared on motion components.   I'm not saying standard threaded rods won't work, or won't work really well to start. I am nervous that they won't hold up as well long term. I want to make sure that a $1200 CAD printer can survive the inevitable head meets bed accident without major damage.  Last one: BigBox printers according to the kickstarter are wood frame by default, with a 99 pound upgrade to Acrylic / Altuglas (depending on where you read). Nothing for or against here, just that most comments are talking about acrylic as if it's the default frame option, while it is not.  With all that said, I like what I see so far. I had planned for a Taz at some point next year, but this printer has the print volume I want, the hot end I want, a far FAR simpler looking extruder, and seems to be a pretty stable platform to modify and build on... at around half the price. The tradeoffs are that it's not a metal frame, and possibly the Z axis threaded rods."

3Dprinting,3do7bk,ntoff,2,Fri Jul 17 23:53:18 2015 UTC,Agreed. Also read that you need to put some thermal compound on the threads of the heat break on the cold side to help keep PLA from jamming.

You just need to remember to use a low retraction setting, for me that's about 2 - 3 mm because I'm using bowden but for direct I believe it can be something like 0.5mm (don't quote me on that) so the melty bits don't get pulled up into the PTFE part and get stuck."

Have a look at the drawing. The PTFE tube ends in the enlarged bore at the top, and the melt zone is only within the bottom 5mm, with the heat transition zone continuing for another 2.1mm after that. You should be able to retract 10mm without pulling melty bits into the PTFE.  And even if you did, PTFE is non-stick. People use PTFE liners in their hotends precisely so that when you pull hot melty parts too high, it doesn't get stuck.  The reason you need to keep your retraction relatively slow (40mm/s) is that you need to give the plastic time to release its heat and solidify so that it doesn't get stuck in the cold section of an all-metal hotend. This applies for all all-metal hotends."

For a more permanent fix you can look into printing an oiler which is basically just a printed piece that will hold the paper towel. There a bunch of files online for just that.  The lubrication shouldn't mess with the extrusion since the hobbed bolt is biting into the filament as is pushes it into the hot end.

Measure it with some calipers, if its close to 3mm, (like 2.98mm), that may be your problem, I know I've experienced this before.   It could also be that the PLA is expanding in the heat break and causing the clog, which would be due to not enough cooling, which could be due to the summer heat (if you have summer heat where you are).  You can also try running some extruder cleaning filament through your hotend, which would clear any debris which may be causing the clog issues."

The biggest thing is removing dust and crud that is on the filament before hitting the hot end. The tiny bit of oil definitely stops air printing and other jams. The down side is that there is this.. oily residue on some of the walls, but that could be from someone at our makerspace using too much."

Shouldn't be getting those gaps between the walls.  More likely you need to up the temperature.  Check your speed settings. if your infill is 80mm/s and your exterior wall is 40-50mm That will explain the slight under extrusion throughout.

Also make sure you check you soldering technique, if required, although there is not much soldering to do generally.  The harder part can be actually dialling the printer in, calibrating it properly. Its not so much tricky but it can take some time. Your first prints will point to issues that will need to be tweaked and you will have to diagnose problems and make appropriate adjustments.   Luckily, there is so much support out there that you will always find help."

I don't think I've ever used honeycomb because I imagine it would be pretty strong and a pain to remove. And of course you can minimize or possibly eliminate the need for supports by being clever with your model orientation. The newer preview features in slic3r are very helpful for this."

(I was originally backing at the level that included a driver board too, but then the BBP guys said they were going to support the Diamond, and I was already backing their board...so I went down a tier to save money for filament!)  btw, here's all the Diamond unboxing pics for those interested.  I plan to shoot a better, more extensive, set of pics when I get my BBP and am ready to assemble the hotend-- a process I'll document --but for now these are pretty good.   http://media.makecoolthings.com/wp/2015/06/3dp_diamondunbox01.jpg http://media.makecoolthings.com/wp/2015/06/3dp_diamondunbox02.jpg http://media.makecoolthings.com/wp/2015/06/3dp_diamondunbox03.jpg http://media.makecoolthings.com/wp/2015/06/3dp_diamondunbox04.jpg http://media.makecoolthings.com/wp/2015/06/3dp_diamondunbox05.jpg   One additional benefit of the Diamond, though, is that you can blend colors.  I plan to try it with ESUN's PETG filaments, because their translucent Magenta (which I've also seen referred to as 'Rubine Red'), Yellow, and Reflex Blue filaments are fairly close to optimal for that I think.

SEE ILLUSTRATION. You'll likely need to scale this, possibly non-uniformly, but the curves should all be about right..  I took the measurement of the thumb in each picture, and drew the profile curves. Then I scaled the profiles and thumb measurements to uniform scale, and aligned them to each other. i used a sweep command to create the surface from the curves.  You can either scale it uniformly based on the thumb measurement above, or you can scale it non uniformly based on edge lengths, which is likely the best method.

You could make a perfectly functional bong, even one out of food safe plastics, as long as you had something else (metal, ceramic?) to hold the burning part. But it wouldn't be a good idea. Even food safe plastics aren't guaranteed to be safe if they're burnt, and you'd have a hell of a time properly cleaning after use.

3Dprinting,3do0oc,ThatFatKid,2,Sat Jul 18 08:10:02 2015 UTC,"You don't need to go that far, when printing a bong out of plastic you have to understand a few things.    It's not permanent - You can print some crazy bubbler/perc/etc designs but because of the nature of a basic filament style printer It's not going to last for long. The resin build up, ash, and water grime will stain the plastic and cleaning a plastic bong isn't something I would attempt. Plastics: Acrylic (What actual plastic bongs are made out of and sold.), Some form of PET. Doesn't absorb water, can be boiled, strong, prints like PLA. As of right now the only Acrylic filament I know about is currently being made by the E3D guy's. Glass: The only company I know working on a glass like filament is E3D but it's not the type of glass you think it would be. Ceramic: This is the only thing I could see being used for legit piece's and long term use, after you print you're part it can Fired/cured and then be glazed which gives it that shiny ceramic texture but this is also what makes it useable for cups, bowls, plates, things you can actually use.  Glass Downstem/Slide - This is a must! You need to keep the heat away from the plastic, a two piece system is you're best bet. The glass absorbs the initial heat and keeps it from getting the plastic hot enough to release any form of gas. Once the smoke hit's the water It's cooled enough to make the piece function able.   That's really about it on making a 3d printed bong, use common sense here. I suggested PET as it's what water bottles are made out of, so think about the DIY gatorade bongs people use. The same thing applies here, they work but after a week of use they get funky and it's time to make another one. The same applies with the 3d printed bongs, with enough use It's going to become unusable. A tip I can offer is to empty the water when it's not in use, keeps it cleaner/useable longer.   $20 cheap glass bong might last a day (cheap glass) or last years. $20 worth of plastic used you can make a sick piece, will only last 2-4 weeks. Ceramic I have know idea on, a lot of factors here I don't to much about."

This is a huge problem with this hobby that will surely end in tragedy for someone. Go to Walmart and buy a 30amp cartridge fuse holder from the boating/auto section and install it inline from your power supply to your printer board."

Another common practice was to take an item printed days before and put it into a 5th generation printer to make it appear as if it had just been printed by that machine.

They're losing money drastically due to these 'DIY' level printers and they know it isn't going to stop any time soon. So in order combat this, they did the most logical thing and bought the most 'well known printer company'. But as a 3D printing company selling printers for $40k+, you can't have a $2500 print as well as the $40k printers, so what do you do? You take this printer that you now own, add a bunch of creature-feature upgrades to make it look like you care and then sabotaged the extruder, the one key thing that a printer desperately needs. Anybody can make a 3 axis gantry, but it takes talent to make an extruder.   So What is the goal of this exercise? To make the 'best printer on the market the worst. This way the public perception of these printers would return to the ""they'll never be main stream"" or ""they'll never be more than a science fair project"" and people will stop buying them. I've already seen this in happen multiple times at places I've worked at where people actively avoid DIY printers due to this perception. These are the places they're looking to make the most of this money back and they won't touch a DIY level printer because they're afraid of the fuss. So I guess you could say it's working.  Prime example of this is at my current job, we were looking into buying 3-4 printers for the engineers and we were just about to pull the trigger but then someone expressed the issues that MBs have and that pretty much sold the purchasing manager on the idea that all DIY level printers are junk and thus we now own two $40k printers. Now we have to jump through hoops just to print something because of the ridiculous costs involved. (filament, build plate etc)   The saddest part is that we all know the truth, that these printers (4th gen Replicators or other printers) can print just as good as the expensive printers but that is because we took the leap of faith to find this out. Additionally, this slows down the process of improving printer technologies because larger companies like Samsung or LG aren't interested in the market as a result."

I was a massive Makerbot fan with the replicator 2 and I was so looking forward to CES2014 to see what Makerbot was going to release, I was ready for a Replicator 3X that could do soluble support and a dedicated ABS/PLA hot ends to avoid issues with using the same hot end for different plastics.  Instead they bring out a DOWNGRADED, more expensive machine. They sold it under the guise of being consumer friendly, but they also released 2 other printers, why couldn't one of those be PLA only and have a 3X available for those who want ABS? I straight away suspected sabotage by Stratasys. I'm sure you already know this too so I'm not trying to teach you a lesson, this is more for other people reading this, the Replicator 2X was a serious threat to the Mojo which just came out. By removing all ABS and dual extrusion possibilities, this was a plan to ensure the Mojo remained the cheapest, best soluble-support printer on the market. Stratasys would happily ruin Makerbots future generation of printers if it meant the Mojo sold more.   That I firmly believe, but the screwing up of the extruder I think wasnt some callous ploy against the industry, that was just a result of trying to push the new machines out way too fast to get maximum profits.

What sucked even more, I scraped together a rather large chunk of cash and bought the SD2 expert model at full price which was something like $799 + filament + shipping + tax, all in all nearly 1k, which wasn't easy money for a full time student working at a coffee shop part time.   So yeah, fuck that company."

The unit would lose it's firmware so I was re-flashing it constantly. The auto-level sensor was inaccurate, and it seemed to trigger at random heights (including a few inches above the bed).   I was willing to work through all of it because going into it I knew this was a budget machine, and 3D printing is quirky at best. However, I never got a single response to support requests. I packed it back up and sent it off to Amazon for a refund.   When I got my Dremel it wouldn't boot up. The start screen would reset on boot up in a loop. I had Dremel tech support on the phone in a couple of minutes, and we solved the problem right there (loose  micro SD in the unit).   3D printers take a certain mix of patience, technical ability, and willing to experiment in order to dial them in. I don't have patience so picking a printer with responsive tech support was my number one priority. Now that I've gained a little more knowledge with printing I feel like I could go back and tackle a Printrbot, but don't really need to. Time to move up to something bigger...like a Wanhao 5s."

3Dprinting,3dkrry,spence123458,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:51:34 2015 UTC,Ive had a shit tonne of issues with mine and im still trying to work on sorting it. My belt had part skipped off the pulley opposite the stepper. According to the wanhao website there is an issue with the toothed pulley attached to the stepper that sometimes is loose and that  cause it to print oval circles. Unfortunately the shitty chinglish video on youtube does not mention the size of the alan key needed to tighten it or the size of the grub screw if one needs to be replaced. None of my alan keys seem to fit properly (metric or imperial).

3Dprinting,3dju5i,Xera1,3,Thu Jul 16 21:15:12 2015 UTC,"Got the same kit for nearly the same reasons. Some thoughts:   I couldn't get the electronics box to kit all the cables. Left just the mounting plate and discarded the other two plates.   The Z-rods are wobbly which made printing at 0.1 difficult, 0.2 works just fine. Currently working on remodeling these: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:139857 (this model is to long and fat to fit in the way its intended onto my configuration.   Replaced the silly rubber tubes connecting the Z motors to the threaded rods with flexible aluminum shaft couplers. I don't think the tubes were causing problems but they were long and ugly.  The lack of a print fan also bothered me and after struggling to find a decent fitting 40mm fan housing I made my own: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:930929 It replaces the stock heat-sink 20mm fan clamp as well.    On the topic of PLA out of the Prusa Nozzle MK2: I still can't get it to finish a print without jamming. ABS works great. Not sure what to do about that yet.   The plate of Glass that came with my kit is warped. This makes bed leveling a nightmare since the bed has no clamps holding it to the Y stage. You can loosely zip tie the bed down bed down and it'll work fine.  This collection has a few useful upgrades: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:707109 for after you get the kit built. The Z axis tops with bearings really made a huge difference in layer alignment.   The electronics don't get hot at all. But they do seem to lose any changes you make to the preheat settings when you power them down. Also the Power supply has no power switch.     Its a great kit and if you put a bit of love into it you'll end up with an awesome printer."

This kit looked like a perfect one, but one of my requirements to be perfect is to print every possible material (the ones we have right now).

Borrowed some old pla from work but I also switched Slicers (Slic3r to Simplify3D) so I haven't really isolated the issue. The PLA did sit at customs for a while and was opened so there is a chance it got a bit wet. I'll keep testing but it does seem like this nozzle can handle PLA just fine. Relevant to /u/Xera1 as well.

I've printed a few parts with ABS so far and the quality is very good with the only calibration so far being leveling the bed.   I've found the same thing with the electronics box, it seems like a very poor design - the only part of the printer I really have a problem with. I'll probably end up doing the same as you.  Thanks for linking your fan mount, looks very good - how'd you connect the 40mm fan to the board? Is there somewhere that sells a fan with the proper connector?"

I didn't have the right header on the fan I bought so I used a servo female hearer, clipped it down to two leads and used a razor to clean it up so it would fit. Use the same polarity that the 20mm fan uses. You only need a two wire fan but if you get a three wire only use positive and ground."

I printed your fan nozzle at 0.28 (Stock settings, 10% infill) and it came out pretty nice, not sure where that hole came from but oh well.  The auto bed levelling mod looks interesting but what's to stop the nozzle being driven into the glass? Surely both pieces will continue to move down until the nozzle hits the bed, then the end stop piece will move smoothly while the nozzle is jammed against the glass, flexing the bed/something until the switch disengages?  Thank you so much for all your help!"

Usually 245ish Celsius for the first layer.  If that.  Lately i just out it down at 240C and leave the temp.  60C bed temp on blue tape.  Speed depends on part.  Anywhere from 15mm/s to 65mm/s.  I haven't gone higher than 65mm/s.  So, it can probably be done.  In marlin I have the settings at 2.86mm filament width, 4.12mm retraction, anywhere from 22-42mm/s retraction speed and x/y acceleration settings are each 2200, z setting is at 41mm/s.  Extrusion rate is at 109%.  That was the key - getting the extrusion  rate setup properly.    MadeSolid says to run 240-270C and 20-40mm/s.  I find 240 range is best.  It gets more opaque the lower the nozzle temp.  It is about as flexible as ABS, better shrinkage tolerances than both ABS and PLA, it is far better with overhangs, you can air print and bridge like a mofo and it is odorless.

3Dprinting,3dj8sz,classic__schmosby,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:44:51 2015 UTC,"Alright, here's where you need to do some more research. The FAQ and the other comment you replied to list pretty much all the places you can get 3d printable designs (other than designing your own things, but that was in the FAQ, too). Many of those have wrenches (which aren't good things to print anyway) and there are many storage containers, too. Although if you want anything food safe and with a good seal you aren't going to be able to print them.  If all you need are wrenches and tupperware (and whatever ""stuff like that"" includes) then you might be better off just buying them. There's a saying that goes around this subreddit a lot ""When all you have is a hammer, all of your problems look like nails."" Basically, when you have a 3d printer, you think it can solve every small item problem you have, but it won't. Some things are just better off bought."

The nice thing is that usually, the user benefits from this. I purchased an ATX mid tower on eBay for $20, including shipping. The first one arrived poorly packed, and the plastic pins that held the front panel to the case were broken on one side. We contacted them, they told us to keep it and shipped us another.

Strength is a measure of how much direct tensile load something can handle, whereas pliability/brittleness describes how much something can deform before breaking. A material that is both strong and pliable is said to be tough.  In the case of 3d printing, PLA is strong but brittle, whereas ABS has less ultimate strength but more pliability, so is tougher.

When I unpacked it from the US (to the UK) it came calibrated and printed perfectly first time without a single adjustment. As I'm sure you're aware it takes a lot to built and calibrate a printer to be of a usable quality and with the Cube Pro you get what you pay for, a really well built and polished machine.  The main downside is that the proprietary cartridges are an absolute ripoff! If I remember correctly it's around $70 per 0.3kg, where as you can pick up 1kg for $25 or so normally. Not only that but with the initial 6 cartridges I bought with the printer, 3 of them  refuse to be recognised at all and 1 was so brittle that after 10 minutes of printing you have to stop the print, remove the cartridge, open the cartridge (voiding the warranty!) and feed it through.

You will never owe another dollar to printrbot and can buy parts and filament anywhere.  On the other hand $299 gets you a printer ready to go on day one, but when it breaks chances are it's broke. Without hacking it you can't buy filament from anyone but daVinci, and if you hack it you void the warranty.  Both produce comparable prints. XYZ's software is slightly easier to use out the box, but you can always just buy Simplify3D and suddenly their both easier to use and equally good. The question is are you willing to pay less and make payments to have a machine that works out of the box, or are you willing to spend a weekend to have a machine you can use (with some maintenance yourself) forever?"

The bed carriage is warped though so I'm about to have to replace that if I even can. Mine was on new firmware and I wasn't bricked by hacking it. It was actually really simple to do compared to other projects. I bought when it was 450 but Amazon gave me 100 back on it a month later when it dropped I'm going to see if I can get another 50 now with price match.

You can build a little unit that flashes the cartridge chip, but during various points with the firmware, trying to read a flashed cartridge bricks the printer.  If you want to be restricted to the most basic of basic printing using ONLY DaVinci filament cartridges, then yes, it is super cheap.

3Dprinting,3dfodc,Festernd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:14:44 2015 UTC,10% should not be a common variance in extrusion. Good quality filament only varies 1% in diameter.

3Dprinting,3dfodc,while-eating-pasta,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:20:28 2015 UTC,"True-ish... for total flow it doesn't, but for repeatability it does.  Here's an experiment to show it:  set nozzle diameter to 1/4 of actual diameter, print cube with wall thickness of 4 shells. In theory you'd just have a cube with 4 thin outer walls instead of one thick. in reality, you'd be lucky if it doesn't peel away.  to achieve 6.25 micron accuracy, the 40 micron variance observable in most nozzles would fsk the print.  fortunately, they've updated the literature, and clarified that the 6.25 micro 'resolution' was the size of a single microstep.  additionally, of the 5 e3d nozzles I've measured, they all varied by only 5%."
3Dprinting,3dfodc,SanjayM,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:05:08 2015 UTC,"The link shows 50 micron (0.05 mm) layer height, and that absurdly small 6.25 micron number for ""resolution."" Layer height is doable, I want clarification on what they consider ""resolution.""  I'll join your BS call. I strongly suspect they did some napkin math on their linear motion system's X/Y movement and assumed what they got on paper for distance moved with one microstep was their resolution. Never mind the width of the plastic extrusion, or the round hot end tip's penchant for having a radius on corners. Measuring opposing walls of a test cube can get you some very close numbers if it's perfectly calibrated, but that isn't ""resolution.""  Their kickstarter graphs contradict each other. They use their lowest grade model's price with the highest grade model's features to compare to competing printers. Also they're using the minimum layer height for other printers to compare to their XY movement math (which may not even be accurate) to put themselves in a good light.  Other stuff:  -Flip down microswitch here mount for auto leveling. Cool in that it stays out of the way and works on glass, but you'd better not have any print residue on the probe points. Also what's the margin of error on that switch assembly? Their multipoint probing will mitigate small errors somewhat if it averages out between points, but as you print larger items getting that bed level is important.  -Half max movement speed on the lite version. Why? Also how? Are they giving the lite6 more time to melt, or have they reduced max movement speed in firmware to create a feature point for their more expensive models? Hopefully it's a limit in firmware and can be turned off. I want my non extruding moves to happen quickly, thank you very much.  -I see six motor drivers in their kickstarter photo. That's X, Y, Z(left), Z(right) Extruder 1, Extruder 2? Are all six present on all models, or at least do all models use the same board so they can be added in? Out of the box electronic & power support for dual extrusion would be nice, especially if the mounts are printable by the user.  I'd also really like to know if they are partnered with (as alluded to in this post's title) or just buying their hotends from e3d. The kickstarter doesn't mention them as anything other than hotend providers."

Switch assembly is actually pretty damn good on repeatability, you'd be surprised. The bed definitely does need to be clear when you run the levelling sequence, that's for sure.  Lite version moves same speed as Pro, actual speed that you can extrude when printing is lower on Lite though. But the numbers in the table are wrong.

The amount of material per payer was relatively consistent up to the first major cavity on the piece (recessed from the top about 1/3rd of the object), presumably after that point, there was less material per layer, although the banding persisted past that point for about another 30 layers.

The pictures I uploaded look different but I was getting the exact same pattern you saw before those, but not as pronounced.  https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/3cwqwm/what_caused_sudden_zbanding_printrbot_simple_metal/  I changed the z-coupler, tightened the bolts and printed at various layer heights to try and identify the issue. It seems the coupler somehow, loosened enough to cause that issue. Try taking the threaded rod out and putting it in again, making sure it is directly vertical as you tighten the set screws slowly, one at a time."
3Dprinting,3dfc2e,while-eating-pasta,2,Thu Jul 16 04:28:34 2015 UTC,"Above is probably spot on. Hold your print up to your Z screw. If the pattern of the bands matches up, that's your problem.  Check to see if the Z coupler is stretched like this one which will cause a ton of trouble for you. In that picture the top two bands are fine, the bottom two are where it messed up.  If it's good you might be slightly out of alignment between your motor and the plastic bit that lifts the arm up. Close to the printer it'll be trying to bend a lot and will cause banding. Taller prints will magically cure themselves as the distance between the Z nut and stepper increase. If you want to fiddle with that connection, this person has some good info. When I re seated mine, I did it with the arm as low as I could get it and still access the grub screws on the coupler. Then I manually turned that screw until it was at the top while looking for bending of the rod / feeling for changes in resistance that would indicate it was out of alignment."

If you were just talking about load weight, then it will be carrying lots of coins as per the challenge.   Additionally, the outriggers have most of their buoyant force in the front half of their length, which, combined with extending close to 60mm infront of the main hull, will keep it from pitch poling (hopefully!)."

3Dprinting,3db81b,Tunabarrage,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:40:25 2015 UTC,"I have a Davinci 1.0a modded with Repetier and using Slic3r  Bed Temp: 45  Extruder temp: 195  Filament: XYZ proprietary filament  Supports:  I didn't use supports, but I did use sacrificial towers to allow the piece to cool in between layers.  Per their website the filament should be at 190 with a 45 bed temp. I've tried every temp I can get and the lowest bed temp I can do.  If I lower the extruder temp lower than 195 it will not extrude, it just stops and makes a clicking noise.  If I go higher it will extrude but then ends up a melted mess.  I have tried to use this filament several times before and this is the first time I have gotten it to print out a full print.  Any lower and it will start to print, but  then just randomly stops.  I have tried temps from 160-230.  Finally I got the 195 to print out this morning after messing around for about 6 hours on it yesterday.  I just calibrated the bed, checked the belts, changed out some wiring... My ABS will print fine, but the PLA looks like crap.  Is it the printer? the settings? The filament?  Or do I just need to take some sandpaper to it?  It is natural color and I planed on trying to make a light, but I can't do that if I slap on some filler. You will be able to see the blotches where the gaps were covered up.  Please and Thank you.  EDIT:  Added information."
3Dprinting,3db81b,Tunabarrage,2,Tue Jul 14 22:49:52 2015 UTC,"The davinci 1.0 has a really crappy hot end design, not sure if it carries over to the 1.0a. Basically, the heatbreak where it feeds filament into the hotend gets really hot, not hot enough to melt abs, but hot enough to mess with PLA. When this happens the PLA strand can adhere to the sides of the heatbreak and mess with the extrusion. That could be why you're having issues printing it at higher temperatures.   As for the roughness on the bottom of your print, It would help a lot to have a fan blowing on the layers as they extrude for the overhangs. Also, try printing at a slower speed for the lower layers until you get past the overhangs."
3Dprinting,3db81b,TooSunny,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:15:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you. This is really helpful information.  This is/was going to be made in to a light, I love the transparency that it has.  I want to enlarge this piece at least 2/3 times its size on my next attempt. Do you think that maybe turning the object over and printing the narrower piece first would help or make things worse?"
3Dprinting,3db81b,sigismond0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:27:29 2015 UTC,"I think that would make it worse, actually. I don't have much experience with PLA, but basically taking it slow and printing with a cooling fan aimed at the layers as it prints helps a ton with overhang. I don't know what angle your overhang is specifically, but if it's over about 45degrees or so, you might need to support it anyway (at least for the very bottom where it curves out with a steep overhang)."
3Dprinting,3db81b,rzzbzz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:41:04 2015 UTC,"A low overhang (< 45 degrees) like that without supports will end up looking like that on most printers. You can try increasing cooling or adding supports, but that's just the way things work."
3Dprinting,3db81b,GreazySweet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:41:33 2015 UTC,Thank you. I've got no experience with PLA. The feel is different than ABS. I am assuming they work in the same fashion and will be somewhat easy to removed?

3Dprinting,3dd5hm,Devil_Spawn,4,Wed Jul 15 10:10:34 2015 UTC,Enclosures are good for ABS but bad for PLA.
3Dprinting,3dd5hm,PuffThePed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:08:04 2015 UTC,"Why bad for PLA? As long as it isn't so hot that the part deforms, it seems like a controlled temperature environment would help combat warping."
3Dprinting,3dd5hm,Belfrey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:33:32 2015 UTC,PLA warps when it's warm. To prevent warping I usually put a large fan blowing over the entire print volume. It's the exact opposite of abs.
3Dprinting,3dd5hm,PuffThePed,0,Thu Jul 16 14:38:22 2015 UTC,"Think about what you are saying. PLA may wrap because of a difference in temperature from one layer to the next, but warm temperatures alone don't make it warp. If that was the case parts would randomly warp after they were printed and put to use.   If you have an enclosure that can be heated via something other than the bed, so that the temperature inside the environment is more consistent, then PLA will likely print better with some added warmth."

3Dprinting,3dd5hm,laptopdude90,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:20:37 2015 UTC,"I do not think that much heat is safe for the printer, mainly the stepper motors. You can look up the temperature limits for the stepper motors but if I remember correctly the operating temperature for stepper motors goes up to 115°F. So you're barely squeaking by, but you should be alright."

3Dprinting,3dd5ge,PuffThePed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:20:24 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you're right about over extruding.  It makes sense. Iirc, the extruder setting was something like 1.75:1 with a 0.3mm nozzle.     Did you calibrate your extruder ?     I'm not sure.  I tweaked the speeds for certain features and infill, adjusted temperature, adjusted z and leveled the bed in ways that improved the print, and now my first layer looks good.  My other layers look pretty good except for my Hatchbox orange ABS that has to be printed very quickly or at unusually low temperature to prevent jamming, which makes for a decent looking print, but unfortunately has poor interlayer adhesion...so I'm machining parts for a new hotend to fix it.  I didn't follow any specific calibration procedure, didn't print cubes, and don't even know if there's a calibration button in Slic3r.  I'd post some pictures of my prints, but I'm that guy that will go backpacking hundreds of miles with a camera in his hand without taking a single picture...and I'm just as bad in the shop.    Calibration is definitely something I need to look into more, along with many other things since I'm planning on making myself an oversized 20 in3 enclosed dual extruder variation of the Prusa i3.  Let me know if you have any thoughts about the design that could make the printer better to adjust and use.  Let me know if there's any information I could provide.  I'm not that knowledgeable about 3d printing, and I know I don't know what I need to know to help you figure out what my problem is."
3Dprinting,3dd5ge,atetuna,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:48:16 2015 UTC,"I rotated the model around, told it the filament was 1.77mm rather than 1.75 and raised up the z axis by 0.01mm. Seems to be doing better but still not perfect. I imagine most of the improvements were made by simply shuffling how the slicer decided to segment the print. Guess I'll just keep on finagling with it, surely I can narrow down the culprit eventually."
3Dprinting,3dd5ge,ganpachi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:02:41 2015 UTC,"I find rippling is usually a function of Z-calibration. When the first layer is printed too low, it ripples because there is too much material for the calculated layer height. When it is too high (and I mean just ever-so-slightly too high) the material may curl away as it bonds to the printed line next to it and create wave-like ripples."

I have mine set to .36 mm (with a default printing width of .4mm) and they are just strong enough to stay where I want them to, but still easy enough to snap off.   Two interface layers, tight .05 spacing.   I also run honeycomb supports as they theoretically work in any orientation. I have had some stuff literally fall through the cracks when the overhang runs parallel to the rectilinear support orientation."

With PLA, I'd just rather avoid supports altogether, and if they're absolutely necessary, I print with ABS."

Threaded rods should have a light coating of grease, Lithium grease works great for this."
3Dprinting,3d8p8x,random_account_538,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:35:02 2015 UTC,I am thinking about using my old engine oil as a brush on lube. I have been brushing on axle grease on the rods and use a high quality paper towel to wipe them before applying fresh stuff. I wonder if used 5w20 will be better. Food for thought.

3Dprinting,3d8p8x,ganpachi,0,Tue Jul 14 17:28:26 2015 UTC,"Motor oil's detergents will retain water if not heated periodically (like it is in an engine), causing rust. Not sure if that's a problem for little 3d printers but it is certainly a problem for larger machine tools. Oil is usually available in non-detergent versions."
3Dprinting,3d90ng,freakiegamer,3,Tue Jul 14 13:13:11 2015 UTC,"The lab I work for is currently using an autodesk Ember SLA printer, and in the last weeks we've sort of hit our stride. The settings will require you to spend a lot of time fiddling with it- only one of our people has put in the time enough to get a decent workflow.   The printer itself needs a lot of fiddling and there are still plenty of failures: layers don't print right, object falls off, model is the wrong shape/unprintable. It's definitely not the kind of printer you leave unattended, and the jamming and need for refills are not infrequent.  It doesn't appear that SLA printing is an exact science yet.  The quality is good, but can be delicate- lots of scaring for supports, surfaces aren't always smooth, etc. I myself am trying to figure out a good way to finish the prints, as we have had only limited success with the alcohol baths and nail polish.  Oh yeah! Did I mention that it was very goopy and the chemicals used require a lot of caution? You'll be doing a lot of wiping."
3Dprinting,3d90ng,relkbat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:54:04 2015 UTC,"Well - that being said then... Do you know of an affordable printer (<$5,000) with minimal failed prints/maintenance?  I have a feeling there is no such printer but as the need for the 3D printer is minimal, I don't want to portray to the company that 3D printing is incredibly difficult to use and requires a lot of support to keep it running."

3Dprinting,3d90ng,iDig3Dprinting,2,Tue Jul 14 15:21:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can get a full colour 3D printer for < $5000. Is Full colour an absolute requirement? What is it that you need Full colour for?  As to maintenance and failure rate.  The failure rate will go down as the machine gets dialled in to the material and models being produced, together with the general calibration of the machine.   Maintenance is another matter. Most models have some bugs but FDM is probably your less high maintenance option."
3Dprinting,3d90ng,iDig3Dprinting,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:17:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry - full color is not a requirement at all. It was mentioned 2 or 3 colors would be nice but is not necessary.

3Dprinting,3d90ng,iDig3Dprinting,2,Thu Jul 16 21:42:24 2015 UTC,"mobius1ace5 and iDig3Dprinting bring up a good point– there is not really a 3D printer that won't require ongoing maintenance and someone that knows how to troubleshoot. That being said, I'm pretty sure that's true of any machine.   Other posters are correct– there is no printer that's going to give you colour for that kind of price. You probably don't need colour, which will only detract from the structural design features anyway.   That being said, my person preference is the TAZ lulzbot V– which is a great printer if you're actually willing to spend the time learning to use a 3D printer.  EDIT: TAZ V is not SLA but I don't have experience beyond the Ember"
3Dprinting,3d90ng,toddthefrog,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:59:13 2015 UTC,"We believe, that multi-colour printing with and SLA printer is not possible.  SLA printing relies on a reservoir of resin. For true multi-colour printing the only way to achieve this would be for the resin to change colour based on some variable property of the light beam, i.e wavelength.   The alternative would be to be able to flush the reservoir with a different coloured resin. The latter would produce a very limited multi-colour capability but is easy to achieve if you can pause the print.  It may be that someone has created the former, we deal in FDM printers so we are not sure about that.  As to failure rates this is always variable and depends on the user, the machine and the model. What I can say about SLA is that you need to think of what you want to do with your models, SLA resins for example tend to be sensitive to light and can produce objects less robust than FDM printers. They can be good for making moulds.  You really need to define your exact requirements and list them in priority order. Like most things its swings and roundabouts.  You can get FDM printers with low resolution though. We sell the ROBOX FDM printer that goes down to 0.02mm z-resolution and there is the Projet system if you want proper multicoloured printing, but these come at a professional price."
3Dprinting,3d90ng,iDig3Dprinting,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:00:55 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  While it may not be possible to print in color right now I don't believe this will always be the case.  Just off the top of my head I see at least two different ways to do this, one is with a rotating bed of color baths, the other is physically depositing naturally repulsive (oil/water) based pigments on top of white resin.  I foresee a few fun hurdles but nothing particularly show stopping.  Edit:  A technique similar to Ebru is what I had in mind."
3Dprinting,3d90ng,toddthefrog,3,Tue Jul 14 14:25:16 2015 UTC,Apologies. You can change the colour if you change the resin in the reservoir as we stated so multicoloured 3D printing with an SLA printer is possible now. But we made the assumption that this is not the kind of multicoloured printing freakiegamer was interested in. To our Knowledge true multicoloured 3D printing on a SLA machine is not currently possible.  I think that having resin that is able to change colour on the basis of a variable property of the light source would be the most fruitful (option 1 in our comment). I haven't investigated this fully but my/our assumption is that chemically this is possible and may already exist in some format.  But as I said we are not aficionados of SLA 3D printing.
3Dprinting,3d90ng,iDig3Dprinting,2,Tue Jul 14 14:52:15 2015 UTC,There's no need for your classy apology here pal.

3Dprinting,3d90ng,st_raged,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:30:32 2015 UTC,"Multi color SLA print is currently impossible. Unless someone comes up with a miracle resin that changes color according to the laser wavelength or intensity, it will stay impossible."
3Dprinting,3d90ng,st_raged,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:03:35 2015 UTC,"Send the parts out to a service bureau (a real one, not some hobbyist group).  That way you can try many different processes, materials, and finish levels without committing to buying a piece of equipment.  In the end you'll probably find that unless you are keeping a printer busy 24/7, then you're better off financially paying someone else to run parts.  You have a laser on your daVinci?  The usual TLA for melt and squirt machines is FDM.  If you are using this machine for business use, none of the consumer level (read <$5k) machines will have the quality, consistency, and most importantly support from the manufacturer that you'll need.  Objet (polyjet machines, now owned by Stratasys) has some relatively low cost machines (<$25k).  The higher end versions can do multiple materials with blending in-between them, so you can get a grey-scale part.  They even have a new machine that can do three materials and get wider selection of colors.  The parts are similar to SLA in that they are UV cured resin and have excellent accuracy and resolution compared to FDM.  This is my go-to process for small engineering prints.  Again, I'd send parts out to be printed.  Unless you are a huge consumer of prints and will keep multiple machines going, the machine and the person you'll need to hire to keep it running will be a drain."
3Dprinting,3d9tke,Joshjingles,2,Tue Jul 14 16:54:28 2015 UTC,"Repetier-Host will let you manually pause a printer mid-print provided you are streaming the G-Code over the serial connection rather than printing from an SD card.   Once you pause the print, you can use the printer controls to park the print head on the side, swap the filament, purge the old color, and then resume the print.   DO NOT accidentally reposition the stepper motors' positioning during this. The printer will not know that it has been bumped, and the rest of the print will be shifted out of phase."
3Dprinting,3d9tke,ganpachi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:03:12 2015 UTC,Also you will probably have layer adhesion issues if you let the print cool too much. I know some people will hit there print with a hot air gun or blow dryer before they restart.
3Dprinting,3d9tke,dm-86,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:49:56 2015 UTC,Thanks all. My printer can manually pause as well (rep 2) and haven't had adhesion issues with it. Was just hoping I could trigger it to pause  at a specific layer so I dont need to wait for 3h and eyeball it.  Any other tips?
3Dprinting,3d9tke,jaybrecht23,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:53:08 2015 UTC,If you are using a rep 2 there is a z pause setting that you can set during the print and the printer will undergo a cold pause until you restart it. The pause is limited to every millimeter (so every five layers if you are using standard resolution) but for whatever reason it stops a layer before it is told to. So if you tell the printer to z pause at 1 mm it will stop after four layers (.8 mm).
3Dprinting,3d9tke,jaybrecht23,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:30:10 2015 UTC,Amazing. Thanks. Is this achievable with the maker software by chance?
3Dprinting,3d9tke,jaybrecht23,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:37:07 2015 UTC,Not that I know of but it is an available option on the printer itself while the printer is printing. It's called z pause height and you can find it by scrolling down to the fifth option on the print menu during a print. Also if you are printing in PLA you shouldn't have to worry about the layer adhesion problem when switching. Are you trying to switch materials or just colors?
3Dprinting,3d9tke,KretzKid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:51:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Just colours from clear to white.   Was really hoping I didn't have to sit and wait to catch the switch 2h into  the print.   Ah well, works this way too. I wonder if simplify3d has options like this."

3Dprinting,3d8d3e,ubermeisters,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:38:58 2015 UTC,"It seems your concern is which one produces better looking parts and not anything else. I own both. Love both.  B9 has approximately 10 times better 'resolution' 30 micron B9 vs 300 micron Form 1+   What this translates to in practice is this; if you want to build objects with sub 50 micron features, you must use the B9. If you don't plan on building features smaller than 100-150 microns, use either the B9 or Form 1+  Some tricks like 'ghosting' a print on a form 1+ will help you get smaller, but maximum feature size i've seen or experience has been 100 microns.   There still may be reasons to pick the form 1+. The design is great and the software is mom proof. But quality of prints is heavily on the side of B9"
