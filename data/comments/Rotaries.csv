Rotaries,3cuzqe,C0rdt,2,Sat Jul 11 18:45:38 2015 UTC,"""I'm pretty sure I warped a side seal. ""  That is physical; a compression check is now required to confirm or disprove.  Make sure to write down your pressure readings. Do you know anyone with a rotary specific compression tester that will ship it to you?  If not, use a normal compression tester with the ""valve"" removed and have someone crank the engine while you watch, you will see three peak readings that repeat in order as it cranks with the comp. tester's valve removed.  That said, as long as the engine is already toast, (you will replace the end or intermediate plate if it's a side seal) go ahead and drive it, it should go fine with low compression as long as it is only one side seal.  Pre-mix Lucas or Marvel oil 1 oz for each gallon of gas every fill up along the way to make up for the missing compression.  /and update your AAA membership."

Rotaries,35vlro,duck_homicide_187,4,Wed May 13 23:05:48 2015 UTC,You'd need a 4 rotor peripheral port but for your streetcar a bridge port will sound very nice.

Rotaries,35vlro,My_usrname_of_choice,2,Thu May 14 01:29:30 2015 UTC,I have had the pleasure of hearing several of Mazda's 4 rotor cars in person at full song. Its glorious. They employ an interesting variable intake system. Look up some of the naturally aspirated 4 rotor rx7s from scoot sports or r-magic.

Rotaries,35vlro,fstbck1970,3,Thu May 14 03:27:22 2015 UTC,Yeah and some tighter valve springs to get the revs up haha
Rotaries,35vlro,duck_homicide_187,1 point,Thu May 14 04:15:26 2015 UTC,"Open up the block, bridgeport it. Drill out the carburettor a bit, the original nikki's on the older 12a's respond quite well to this. Lose the reactor and have a nice exhaust header made. Not even that expensive since you can file out the bridgeport and drill the carb yourself."
Rotaries,35vlro,Rangourthaman_,2,Thu May 14 10:32:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, though. What makes it sound so amazing?   Cams and exhaust make the american V8 gurgle, what makes this sound so incredibly different than a stock RX7/8?"
Rotaries,35vlro,Clay_Pigeon,4,Thu May 14 00:46:38 2015 UTC,4 rotor peripheral port. It moves the intake from the side plates to the rotor housing. Tons of overlap makes it sound the way it does. Even a 13b or 20b sounds badass with a PP. A Bridgeport sounds good too and a little more streetable. Check out YouTube.

Rotaries,33bzz0,in_cod_we_trust,3,Tue Apr 21 15:48:11 2015 UTC,Honestly not even premix just modify the OMP to use a separate reservoir of fresh 2 stroke (or engine) oil instead of dirty old shit from the crankcase.   Just make sure you throw a low level sensor in there.

They're not cheap though, like lazyanachronist said they're high 5-figures.  If you want to stick with a rotary, the older Formula Mazdas go for around $20-25k and use the older 13b. You can race those in the SCCA.  If you're ok with piston engines, Formula Continental or Formula Ford are definitely worth looking at. You can get older cars from the 80's and 90's for under $15k (Formula Fords for less than $10k)."
