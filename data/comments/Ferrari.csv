One weekend there was a Ferrari gathering in my area and I was one of the only places that sold premium fuel. It was a great weekend to work.  A Rosso 355 GTS F1 pulls in and the guy gets out, after he pays I ask him whether I can have a closer look. He was really obliging (assuming they get asked all the time). He was like 'if you want one, then just go for it'. That was 1997.  If I stay on track I am hoping to be in my first Ferrari in about 4 years."

Ferrari themselves say there were 400 Enzos made, but Ferrari historians have since confirmed by gathering serial numbers that there are nearly 500 Enzos that exist. There are many threads on Ferrarichat about it, feel free to search. Ferrari does this with many of their limited cars.  I have brokered purchases and sales of a few high-end cars, including Ferraris. No one serious about selling will honestly bring this significant of a car to market with a handful of photos and a very vague ad. It simply does not happen.  The car is not listed on DuPont, eBay, Hemmings, Ferrarichat... I am unable to find it anywhere other than Craigslist. So, yeah... every channel available, right?   I don't know why, but a fake Enzo pops up for sale once every few months. One just did a run on eBay, used photos from two different cars, super vague ad... and had it listed for like $1.6mm. I don't know if it's a scam, or just people being bored, but it happens frequently.   I have no reason to contact the seller to prove a point to anyone on Reddit.

The yellow one that was displayed in March at the Geneva Motor Show is still in Switzerland. There's a Sergio in Abu Dhabi, and another one in Japan.  I know that the Rosso Sergio Sergio is number five, and the blue one here in California is number one. Unfortunately, the VINs and series numbers of the other four are as yet unknown. The owner of this red one is a Chicago local who, in just one year, has acquired this car, two McLaren P1s, two Porsche 918s, and a LaFerrari.

Bugatti has a great history behind it as well. But it seems like a large portion of people who like them only do so because they are so expensive. I know a car being expensive is part of what makes it so cool to see, and keeps it exclusive, but I am just tired of seeing people compare cars by their price tag.

These are the most expensive F-cars to maintain.  Pick up a 348 or 360 and you're only looking at $2-3k / year.  Don't be fooled.  There's no such thing as a cheap Ferrari.  Either you pay $$$ up front to get a well-maintained car or you pay $$$ post-purchase to keep the car running.  I learned this the hard way.
Ferrari,3c907d,hell_on_wheel,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:09:49 2015 UTC,Care to share your story of how you learned this the hard way? If you don't mind me asking. I'm curious to hear.
Ferrari,3c907d,Skyline99x,2,Mon Jul 6 01:36:46 2015 UTC,Go to Ferrarichat.com and look at the maintenance threads.  One of the biggest costs of ownership is the engine out service to change the cam belts every few years.
Ferrari,3c907d,hell_on_wheel,3,Mon Jul 6 02:24:34 2015 UTC,"The 355 is especially needy as it's got several engine internals that need replacement at some point in the car's life: namely the valve guides.  The cam belts aren't the most costly service for some cars... it's only about $1500 to get them done if you've got a 328 or earlier, or a 360 or later.  Even cheaper if you DIY."
Ferrari,3c907d,Sojohan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:03:09 2015 UTC,"I was referring to F355 specifically. Obviously I don't speak form experience from owning a Ferrari. But I'm trying to be informed because one day if all goes according to plan I will own one. Once I get serious about buying one I won't be looking for the cheapest one, I'll be looking for one that has a well documented maintenance history and recent engine out service, and of course the advice of a good Ferrari mechanic. I know that a 360 would have a lower cost of ownership and higher performance, but the heart wants what the heart wants."
Ferrari,3c907d,Skyline99x,2,Mon Jul 6 04:36:26 2015 UTC,"You have all the infos on Fchat. The ""good"" thing is all the problems of the 355 are well known by now. There's even a tongue in cheek thread about the 10 items you must have in your 355 at all time (stuff that regularly goes wrong). That being said the 355 is probably the next model that will see a massive raise in prices in the coming years, just like the 512 recently. It's amazingly beautiful and the sound of that V8 is magnificent. If you can afford to maintain it properly and enjoy it a few years go for it. You only live once."

The shield is the ""Scuderia Shield"" it signifies the team and it is actually an option on the road cars put on the fenders behind the front wheels, however a lot of them (the current ones at least) have them.   The rectangle is Ferrari's logo just like how other car manufacturers have theirs, such as Jag's leaper, Audi's Rings etc.   The separate Scuderia Ferrari Team logo is updated sometimes and generally looks similar to something that Marlboro is doing."

Ferrari,3bpnek,goldandguns,3,Wed Jul 1 15:16:54 2015 UTC,"Here is a cash from this past sunday (6-28-15) I was the first safety truck on scene. This is one of largest incidents that I have been a part of in my 7 years on the safety team. We (track personnel) repaired nearly 200' of catch fence in 90 minutes. By the end of the day we were back on schedule. Here are a few words that the dispatcher had to say about the crash.  ""I wanted to give my thoughts on this last Sunday’s incident from my perspective. You can see the accident on the Youtube video link below. Once I have been able to see the different videos that are in private and public domain it has given me a fair amount of thoughts to look at.   First, this was my first real major incident I have ever had to deal with while dispatching. I have never dispatched before until this weekend filling in pinch hitter role. I was learning as we went!   Now for the incident! I looked up to the left and saw a car airborne and thought they were showing some highlights from somewhere for a split second. Then I realized that was the live feed at 5. I gave the “Oh shit” and turned around to the officials behind me. All I needed was the look from Carson Wilkinson. No words needed to be said. I immediately dispatched my Safety Truck and Ambulance from Turn 1. Even though I had stuff closer at Turn 5 I cannot send them due to cars still on track coming into the scene.   I stood up ALL safety units including my roving vehicles. Even though I have never had to do this it seemed like natural instinct kicked in. The light switch was turned on, emotions turned off, and an incredibly high awareness come forth. I was told I stayed incredibly calm but they could tell in my voice it was a major incident. Not sure I buy that I was calm but ok….   Unfortunately, a real thought came to my mind of do we have a Mass Casualty Incident. In no time the initial safety truck arrived on scene. They gave a first in and mentioned the drive was ok and that we didn’t appear to have any spectator injuries. The tension in the tower changed. Instead of tension around injury, it now went to restoration of the track. This is always a big concern on pro weekends like this because live feeds whether TV or Internet are time critical to the fan base, and sponsors. We got the cars off the track and could address the scene without worry.   I brought in all resources from all safety trucks, pit lane fire/ems, maintenance, clean up, and vehicle recovery. This is where things really became amazing. The fencing that we all complained about years ago did EXACTLY what it should. It kept the car and parts out of the crowd. Yes if you see the video fencing debris did fly around but none of the poles, etc ended up in the spectator area to my knowledge. It ended up in the buffer area between spectators and track. Again as planned!   Now that all resources were on scene we saw the impossible be possible. There was approximately 200 ft of fencing shredded. How could this get pulled off and still race today? The plan was already there! Maintenance has planned for this scenario. Now they just had to execute on it. We watched a sea of red and orange (safety suit colors). Everyone pitched in. Based on what I heard, there was NO standing around, NO bitching. Simply work being done. Assignments given, people staying on task, and creative solutions to the problems. Using a rollback as a work platform is pure genius! While this was going on my work in dispatch was pretty much done. I didn’t have to communicate much at all other than time estimate updates and acknowledging resource movement. They had the plan, and executed their plan. The tower wasn’t calling them and bugging them, or requesting me to move things along. At one point I had a birdy in my ear ask about getting water on the scene as she was listening from home. I mentioned it to my chief and he was on it. Come to find out Tammy assigned someone already as rehab for the scene and that plan was in process.   Anyone that thinks we don’t manage this like a fire scene should come watch! Fast forward to the end it took 90 minutes to complete the restoration and clean-up of the scene. Where else could you get 30 people in no time dealing with it that fast? The Road America team is simply top notch! All teams worked together seamlessly with no compromise for safety of the spectators or racing. If we can’t repair it right, we don’t finish! At this time I would like to thank the people on the team that performed the impossible. Without all of you, we couldn’t do the greatest job at the greatest track in the world!   Thanks to Carson for believing in me that I could do the job all weekend. I don’t think he had this in mind for me the first weekend! Thanks to the Pirelli World Challenge officials for letting us do our thing! They recognized we had our stuff together and allowed us to execute our plan!   Thanks to Jan and Shellie for all the help and guidance on learning this art of dispatching at the track. I will be back for more. I will give myself a grade of C compared to their expertise. Thanks to the drivers and spectators for coming to the track and making it possible for us to be there.""  This was truly an amazing crash that everyone walked away from. And the teamwork from the track services personnel was second to none!! TL;DR Car crashed, tore up 200' of catch fence, fence repaired in record time, great teamwork, 0 injuries."

Ferrari,3b01uy,xplush86x,2,Thu Jun 25 04:08:38 2015 UTC,"only 500 of these bad boys in the entire world, a huge chunk of these owners are collectors, who bought it straight home to their air conditioned garage, and covered it with silk cloth and let it sit there, to sell it off at a very good price, which this car will almost certainly get in about 10 years. So when a car like this comes for sale, 5 mil is a reasonable price considering the rarity and the fact that even if you had 5 mil in cash under your bed, you probably wouldnt be able to buy one right away unless an owner decides to let it go for that amount."
Ferrari,3b01uy,Grooveman07,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:59:45 2015 UTC,I know someone that was offered $4 million for his. Five million is a bit steep but the asking price on them is already insane.

I've only had one time where I couldn't test drive a car. Some stuck up salesman wouldn't let me test drive a new at the time Porsche 2010 GT3.

Ferrari,3a6e2r,A-Pod,3,Wed Jun 17 18:25:51 2015 UTC,"Used, 100% they let you test drive IF they own the car. Most dealers have used vehicles on consignment. Then you need to prepare documents and enter into a contract prior to driving. As far as new, sometimes they have cars specifically on the lot for that reason. Also, every Ferrari is delivered with miles as they are driven on the track prior to delivery."

Ferrari,394bwb,pleeplious,6,Tue Jun 9 04:07:41 2015 UTC,"Hi.   Take this advice as you please.   I want a ferrari too. I'm a teacher. I'll never get one. But what I did do was buy a 2008 Corvette and supercharged it. I'm putting down 617 horses at the wheel and I'm in it for about 30k. You can find a used Corvette with low mileage quite easily.   When things go wrong, its not much to fix.   If you want a Ferrari, well, I guess only a Ferrari will do. But if you just want to go so fast people refuse to drive with you, you have options."
Ferrari,394bwb,1ststatestereo,5,Tue Jun 9 23:28:18 2015 UTC,"And ferraris are meant to be driven....   This is kind of the problem though... They aren't. If you go to models more than, let's say, ten years old, they're horribly unreliable and difficult to deal with because they weren't made to be driven - not in a modern day car usage way at least.   I've had plenty of Ferraris that just decide they're not going to start, and you call up the garage and all they can give you is ""Yeah, it does that. Try again tomorrow"".   While I certainly judge noone for stretching their budget to own a car they're passionate about, I'm equally passionate about telling them at Ferrari probably isn't the brand to do that with.   The cheap ones are too expensive and difficult to maintain. The good ones are too expensive to buy."
Ferrari,394bwb,10b-5,2,Tue Jun 9 12:05:15 2015 UTC,"You're talking about older models with deferred maintenance, of which there are plenty.  The 3x8/Mondials will run forever if well maintained, and will start every time.  They're dead simple in terms of mechanicals, and very little electricals are involved (thank goodness).  Maintenance is quite simple on these cars too as there's no engine removal needed for minor or even major service, though it makes life easier.  Sorry you've had bad experiences, but that's no reason to tarnish the marque altogether.  Many of these cars, especially the older ones, were hand-finished at the factory.  As the joke goes, if you got one from the AM shift you're good to drive, but if you got one from the PM shift you're in for some maintenance."
Ferrari,394bwb,hell_on_wheel,4,Tue Jun 9 16:06:50 2015 UTC,"You're talking about older models with deferred maintenance, of which there are plenty.    Yes. Also known as the ones OP would be able to buy.   Sorry you've had bad experiences, but that's no reason to tarnish the marque altogether.   Well, I think we've owned close to 120 Ferraris over the years now, so I think I have a reasonable data sample to rely on."
Ferrari,394bwb,10b-5,-1,Tue Jun 9 16:11:03 2015 UTC,"You're assuming OP would just jump out and buy the first thing he finds.  If anything, being of lesser means would motivate one to be patient and shop for a well-maintained example, which isn't necessarily more expensive.  I bought 120 gallons of milk, does that make me a dairy farmer?  Seriously, your mechanic's response to a no-start is to ""try again tomorrow""?  And you pay that guy money?  Whether you owned 1 or 1,000 cars, I'd wonder what you're doing with them if this is your mechanic."
Ferrari,394bwb,hell_on_wheel,-5,Tue Jun 9 16:20:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the differing viewpoint hell_on_wheel ....10b-5 was pretty much saying ""You aren't rich enough to join my club that I am in. Even if you somehow landed a Ferrari, you can't pay the dues to stay in the club. ""   So YES I am a social worker, YES I love cars, and I want a Ferrari my lifetime. Yes, it's gonna be expensive for me but damn it I think I am worthy of a Ferrari but society doesn't think I should even come close to being capable of purchasing one. But I digress....  what about a 2001 Modena with higher mileage but good maintenance records...it's not a a 99 so some of the growing pains are gone? But its also a 15 year old Car...."
Ferrari,394bwb,hell_on_wheel,2,Tue Jun 9 17:45:48 2015 UTC,"A good rule of thumb is that you need to budget about $2 / mile for the 360s, regardless of model year, minimum of $2k / year.  Even before you buy, you should find a good, reputable mechanic nearby (preferably an independent) and have a talk with him about being proactive with maintenance and how much it costs.  These cars do need regular attention, just like every other car, otherwise the problems get expensive and fast.  Another thing to do is spend a while reading threads here, as in a month or two: http://www.ferrarichat.com/forum/360-430/  See what other owners are experiencing, and see how much you can DIY on the car.  You can save big $$$ if you can do things like fluid changes.  Even if you don't DIY spend some time looking around and under the car; keeping a close eye on things can help you spot problems before they become expensive.  I'm not going to steer you away from a 360, it's def. one of the better F-cars in terms of performance for price.  But if any Ferrari will do take a look at a Mondial or 308/328.  They're cheaper to purchase, much simpler to maintain, though some parts can be hard to find, and still make all the right noises & get all the looks."

Do you even know/care how that sounds?  No wonder you think can't I can own a ferarri...By me admitting (proudly I might add) that my financial situation (by choice) is clearly not on the same level as you, your subconscious/ego, I would bet, is threatened by an average middle-class joe owning a piece of machinery that is usually reserved for the super privileged. If I were to own a ferrari, in your mind, the value of your cars would depreciate (of course you would never admit this) and would threaten your privileged existence. Instead of adding positive constructive insight to my original post, you just told me to F off and stick with your ""common man"" cars.

I didn't say you couldn't, I said I didn't think you should. And my advice in that regard was based on a good bit of experience with the cost involved in owning them. A tried and tested cliche about supercars is that you shouldn't buy one unless you can afford two.   is threatened by an average middle-class joe owning a piece of machinery that is usually reserved for the super privileged.    Not at all. On the contrary, I'm spending a lot of time and effort spreading passion for cars, to anyone.

You're doing a whole lot of projecting here.    Instead of adding positive constructive insight to my original post   Which is exactly what I did. And until you found out I was rich, you didn't have a problem with it. My constructive insight is that there's a hell of a lot of options that gives you a much better 'fun for the dollar' than a Ferrari. You can find cars that offers 90% of the fun for 30% of the price. If money is a concern, those are the cars to look at.   you just told me to F off and stick with your ""common man"" cars.    If your financial sense is as bad as your reading comprehension, you shouldn't own any car.    You sir, are exactly the type of person that I would not want help from.

I'm not white though, if that helps. :) Though to be fair, a TLDR of my advice should be this:   You can find cars that offers 90% of the fun for 30% of the price. If money is a concern, those are the cars to look at.   I don't think there's anything wrong with you wanting a Ferrari, I don't think there would be anything wrong with you getting one, as long as you're willing to deal with the hassle and cost. However, I do think you need to at least acknowledge that a Ferrari isn't three times as good as a car that costs a third of it.   Even with older cars, you are paying a pretty significant 'badge tax'."

Ferrari,38ud9k,tylerstig1,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:58:27 2015 UTC,First deliveries are being made in end of August. American models not being delivered until shortly over new years I believe.  I would estimate that the first 6 months of production is already fully booked; although plenty of those cars are held by dealers and can still be purchased. Some reconfiguration should also be possible since they're not actually in production yet.
Ferrari,38ud9k,10b-5,2,Mon Jun 8 05:46:23 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, does someone who purchases a Ferrari typically lease the car (regardless of their financial situation), or do many people own these cars outright?  If the latter, I'd imagine they place the car in a trust for protection against civil suits, etc?  Also I would guess there is an 'escrow' of sorts considering the cost of the car, or is a simple wire transfer at the dealership?"
Ferrari,38ud9k,10b-5,2,Mon Jun 8 06:06:11 2015 UTC,"It depends on a few things. Typically, leasing does offer some financial benefit since you could just place the same money in a fund and get better interest returns there than you would pay for the financing. With good enough returns, the car could essentially pay for itself.  That being said, personally I prefer just outright ownership, instead of having to deal with some other company that places restrictions on what I do with the car, how much I use it, etc.   I think leasing makes a lot of sense for people who are 'just able to' afford it though. (That ignores whether it's smart to buy a Ferrari if you can barely afford it though, but lots of people stretch their budgets for a passion.)  As far as trusts, I'm not sure if that would have any purpose. The insurance company is going to require you to sign on personal liability anyway, so I don't think you would gain much from owning it through a trust. The one benefit would probably be anonymity, if people decide to go snooping on your license plate numbers, but that's not easy to do in America anyway.  As far as payment, usually just a wire transfer. I've even paid cars with a credit card, but that's obviously not a smart decision, since the credit card company will add a couple of percent as a fee."
Ferrari,38ud9k,nielish,2,Mon Jun 8 06:39:30 2015 UTC,Most individuals who purchase a 458 or the new 488 will typically finance long term (84 months). An individual getting into the California T is more likely to lease. With the special cars like the Speciale or Alperta are more likely to be purchased and owned outright.

Ferrari,38ud9k,nielish,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:51:17 2015 UTC,"Financing long term lowers the payment, where they almost feel like a lease payment.

I fell in love with a white f430 spider years ago with red seats. I was in Carmel for the shows and it was a young guy, the windows were so tinted with the windows up and top down you couldn't see the inside but as soon as he put then windows down the red was just shockingly cool. I was maybe 14 and from that point forward I've always that color combo on a convertible.   When I was buying my current car I almost did a black metallic exterior with red interior but I didn't really like it when I did my extended test drive. The red was just so loud that I didn't really like it for a DD. So I did black on black with red accents and stitching and black piano lacquer trim. Its perfect IMO.

Unfortunately, also the most expensive to maintain... valve stem seals, sticky controls, sticky valves, brittle manifold.  Easily 3-4x the maintenance cost of other models.  My Mondial's only cost me $0.75 per mile, the F355 is closer to $2 per mile.  I'd love to own one, just to drive it through tunnels and giggle maniacally, but I could spend the money to customize one or two cars and get just as many smiles per gallon.

Ferrari,31gal2,nielish,0,Wed Apr 8 20:46:48 2015 UTC,"I can speak with certainty. You would not be able to walk into a dealership and purchase one off of the floor. Each Ferrari is custom ordered and built for each client. Now, on occasion, if someone cancels or back out of a vehicle that was ordered, then you may have the opportunity step in and take that vehicle. But, you would have to take a vehicle someone else speced out. I am speaking for the US market, not sure how it works in other markets. Take the 488 for instance. If you have never owned a Ferrari, you are probably last on the ordering list and will porb have to wait two to three years."
Ferrari,31gal2,DenseCookie,-1,Tue Jun 23 12:25:48 2015 UTC,"Depends on the dealership. My uncle was tuned down from buying a new F430 in 2008 and had to buy one used. He bought a new 458 in 2011 and traded that in thus year for an F12. He told me that the F12 can't be your first new Ferrari from that dealer. My dad was turned down from buying a new 458 Spyder from the same sales guy that sold my uncle his cars, and my dad showed up in an SLR and had bought a 911 Turbo a few years before. It has nothing to do with that, just dealership policies."
Ferrari,31gal2,Cs5ski,-3,Mon Apr 6 16:02:11 2015 UTC,"This is the way it is with Ferrari, I speak from experience, i have 3 Ferrari's, my first was a used F430 Scuderia with only 2600 miles on it. After owning it for 6 months i was able to get on the list to order a new 458 Italia. The best example is the 458 Spyder (thats what Ferrari calls a convertible you moron) a brand new one cost between $255k-$285k if you were able to order one. Go to Dupont Registry and check, a 1-3 year old 458 Spyder with low miles sell for $300k-$370k. Anyone can by a low mileage used Ferrari but you can not just show up and order a brand new one like it was a corvette."

There are no New Ferrari's for sale from a dealers (except The California Ferrari which is the starter car) inventory except in a very rare circumstance.  The used cars are more than a new one if you are lucky enough to order a new one. Yes you have to own a used Ferrari to be able to place an order for a new one. Typically you place a deposit of $20k then you are put on a waiting list for allocation of the model you want, Ferrari decides if and when you get one, and they decide what model they will let you have. Thats why they hold their value, there are more buyers than new cars available."

Ferrari,30pbcm,xfortune,3,Sun Mar 29 23:37:30 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm concerned the sub became a bit better after that rule was dropped. Was constant bitching about spoilers there. At the time there was a lot of bickering about it, and in the end it was a rule for the majority to fiddle with for the minority that couldn't watch it live. Was even whining in threads people popped in to that didn't have any results, but results got referred to in comments. Also people accidentally watching a gif of an incident in the race that could have been posted, boom spoiler.   I'd suspect the reason why they are ""twats"" about it is that the subject was really heavily debated, and there was a constant shitstorm about it.   Reddit is no problem to do without spoilers until you've watched the race. Unsub if you aren't watching live, or if you browse /r/all, just do /r/all-formula1 and it will filter out content from that sub."

Ferrari,309c24,knele,1 point,Thu Mar 26 13:19:54 2015 UTC,"No, no. I didn't mean to insult Lamborghini with referring to them as Audi, Audi badged sports cars ( RS models ) exhibit extremely similar handling characteristics to those of a Huracan. Huge amounts of grip but zero adjustability, no rotation whatsoever can be provoked even with seriously daft lift offs or power inputs.  That's why I prefer Ferrari's way of doing sports cars, make something that's inherently balanced, something that requires certain amount of driver's skill and than equip it with electronic aids capable of restraining the car and keeping it between the capabilities of more novice drivers. What you're left with is a car that can be enjoyed equally by a huge amount of different drivers, from inexperienced ones to hardcore club racers.   Where Huracan ceases to amaze more demanding drivers out there. It's astonishing on so many levels but not where it counts, at least not for someone with higher expectations."

Pobst's lap was well within boundaries of grip , 8/10 I'd say, so no understeer there.   Every credible driving magazine out there ( Evo, Autocar ) claimed the car was a mess dynamically. MotorTrend here says otherwise, they say that Lambo resolved those issues but take a look at a Lago's try around the figure eight, same car.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqu3a3PZihk  Wardrobe, a damn wardrobe, damn shame too.

If you like mashing the throttle on the straights and taking corners like if you were on rails, sure , Huracan can do that. I'm interested in what happens when the grip runs out, up to that point Huracan could be the holy grail for all I care, but that's not what "" spirited driving "" means to me, -on the track that is.  It all comes down to what are we asking the car to do, and what it can deliver, it might be right up your alley, it sure as hell isn't right up mine."

Ferrari,2wwtgb,just2good,2,Mon Feb 23 20:57:16 2015 UTC,Picture review of this kit here!
Ferrari,2wudpx,bullet50000,5,Mon Feb 23 05:36:52 2015 UTC,"They don't want to, I think, for fear that something will be faster than it, and you will have bought a $1.7 million car that isn't the greatest. The Veyron can get a pass because 254 mph (or 258 if the SS comes into the equation) is so ridiculous (although VW was equally cagey initially for reasons I don't understand), but Ferrari doesn't have that leg to stand on with the LaFerrari. Particularly if the 918 and P1 go around and are much faster, that will piss people off at Ferrari."
Ferrari,2wudpx,MintyChaos,7,Mon Feb 23 06:29:52 2015 UTC,"Additionally, Ferrari wants to ensure that any test wouldn't be skewed by something unseen/unexpected happening, which is why they want to send a factory car. They want the car in its purest to be tested, which I can somewhat understand (given the shitstorm that happened when the Tesla roadster was tested and Top Gear threw a fit over the model supposedly running out of power).  On the other hand, Ferrari can be notorious for tuning such a factory model to pull every bit of performance out possible, which is somewhat unfair to the other cars since it's not an accurate representation of the final product.  McLaren should send their factory PR car, reasonably tune it as they'd like and as Ferrari would to make sure the car acts normally, and get on with it.  Or Ferrari can do the same and just allow a customer car to be used. Either way, the backlash can't be THAT much from it, considering most Ferrari/McLaren/Porsche customers probably can't eek out the level of performance to really create much difference between the 3 hypercars.  Finally, this has all been somewhat disheartening for a car fan; the lack of proper journalism makes it hard to trust the media nowadays with rumors floating that Ferrari forces reviewers to always make their car win in order to keep reviewing new Ferraris (which seems to always be the case in recent head-to-heads).  We just need some classic competition to call manufacturers out on their BS."
Ferrari,2wudpx,bullet50000,5,Mon Feb 23 06:46:44 2015 UTC,"The problem with thinking the backlash can't be that much is that most people who buy one of the big 3 are likely going to be buying only one of the big 3. The Mclaren, the Porsche, or the Ferrari. You go for the Ferrari, you spend the extra $350k over a P1 (or $900k over a 918), and you are probably buying the Ferrari because of the reputation that it will be the fastest, and then the Brit or the German comes and totally eats its lunch on the track. You're never going to drive it on the track, but it's MAJOR bragging rights with that car (which, TBH, is why you're spending almost if not over $1,000,000 on a car, or in the case of the Ferrari, almost $2,000,000). Ferrari has locked itself in a hole with that car where if 1 thing comes off, they lose with that car because it had more expectations, particularly considering it costs the most.  I do rather hold a bit of a thing against modern Ferrari ever since the whole debacle came out about their use of specialized models of cars for straight-line or corner testing, so it may be that side of me talking, but I just feel rather cynical about this and don't trust the current management when it comes to this sort of thing of brand protection."
Ferrari,2wudpx,MintyChaos,3,Mon Feb 23 06:54:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess there's a lot riding on this considering that this is THE Ferrari and Ferrari represents one of FIATs most profitable sectors and one of the world's most powerful brands. At the same time, there is more to that $350,000 extra than simply all-out track speed. Interior design, exterior design (the Ferrari is the most amazing looking IMO), as well as sound (holy shit does the Ferrari sound good), and the brand itself (which is greater than the speed of the car itself).  I thought Ferrari had settled that when the 12C was slightly faster than the 458 on track but was unanimously less exciting to drive, but there's probably a lot more to all this that's making all the brands hesitant."
Ferrari,2wudpx,10b-5,0,Mon Feb 23 06:59:11 2015 UTC,"Additionally, Ferrari wants to ensure that any test wouldn't be skewed by something unseen/unexpected happening, which is why they want to send a factory car. They want the car in its purest to be tested, which I can somewhat understand (given the shitstorm that happened when the Tesla roadster was tested and Top Gear threw a fit over the model supposedly running out of power).   No, they don't want their car to be at its purest, they want their car to be specifically tuned for the track it will be tested on.   It's a fucking obnoxious practice, and I've told them in pretty clear text how I feel about it, but it's not like they really give a fuck about my opinion. Especially not as long as I keep throwing money at them."

It has sympathetically restored a Ferrari 212 Export Coupé Vignale to its former splendour. The car has an unusual history. It was built in April 1951, then in May, it was sold to Antonio Mambretti Sozogni Juva and a month later it was sold to the company of the Duke Cesare d’Acquarone.  In fact, it was the Duke of Acquarone, who at the end of 1951, opted for a radical change of bodywork. The car, which was originally a hardtop, was transformed into a convertible or “Barchetta” by Vignale. In 1957 it changed hands again, bought by an enthusiast from Padua, whose son recently sold the car to a Brazilian collector. In recent years, the 212 Export has been a regular competitor in the historic Mille Miglia.  The car has undergone a total ground-up rebuild, restored to the way it was come the end of 1951 and it is now ready to be returned to its owner. However, the handover will take place only in April, as the owner has agreed to the 212 being displayed in the Maranello Museum for a couple of months."

Ferrari,2umlnk,CaptainPickACard,3,Tue Feb 3 14:07:39 2015 UTC,"FERRARI 488 GTB: EXTREME POWER FOR EXTREME DRIVING THRILLS    The new V8 debuts at Geneva: track-level performance and responsiveness for the road  Maranello, 3 February 2015 – Forty years on from the unveiling of its first ever mid-rear-engined V8 model, the 308 GTB, the Prancing Horse opens a new chapter in its 8-cylinder history. The Ferrari 488 GTB provides track-level performance that can be enjoyed to the full even by non-professional drivers in everyday use. Its response times, nimbleness and on-the-limit driving guarantee a unique sense of exhilaration and unparalleled driving pleasure.  The new berlinetta brilliantly encapsulates Ferrari’s experience in both F1 and the WEC, where the 458 GT holds the World Championship title and has won its category in the last two editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The new model also exploits to the full the know-how gleaned by Ferrari technicians over the last decade through the XX programme which makes extreme track-only cars available to gentleman test-drivers. The data yielded has made a significant contribution to the refinement of the electronic and vehicle control systems so that drivers can make the most of the incredible performance of this new car.  The Ferrari 488 GTB’s new 3902 cc V8 turbo is at the top of its class for power output, torque and response times, making it the new benchmark for this kind of architecture. The engine unleashes 670 cv at 8,000 rpm along with 760 Nm of maximum torque in seventh gear and a response time to the accelerator of just 0.8 seconds at 2,000 rpm. These figures are sufficient to allow the Ferrari 488 GTB to accelerate from 0-200 km/h in an astonishing 8.3 seconds and, when combined with the radical innovations introduced on all aspects of the car’s performance, lap the Fiorano track in just 1’23”.  The gearbox features Variable Torque Management which unleashes the engine’s massive torque smoothly and powerfully right across the rev range, while specific gear ratios deliver incredibly progressive acceleration when the driver floors the throttle. As is always the case, Ferrari’s engineers have dedicated great attention to perfecting the 488 GTB’s sound, creating a new soundtrack that is full, clear and totally distinctive, as expected from any Prancing Horse engine.  The car’s aerodynamics also made a pivotal contribution to performance: its 1.67 efficiency figure is a new record for a production Ferrari, and is the fruit of 50 per cent more downforce than the previous model and reduced drag. The greatest challenge was achieving these two goals simultaneously. Several innovative elements were specifically developed to do so, not least a double front spoiler, base bleed side intakes and, at the rear, active aerodynamics coupled with a blown spoiler. The aerodynamic underbody, which incorporates vortex generators, is highly sophisticated, too.  The Ferrari 488 GTB’s subsystems and electronic controls make its power and performance instantly available and controllable. It is, in fact, the most responsive production model there is, with razor-sharp response times comparable to those of a track car.  The evolved version of Ferrari’s side slip angle control system (Side Slip Control 2 – SSC2) is more precise and less invasive, providing greater longitudinal acceleration out of corners. Aside from integrating with car’s F1-Trac and E-Diff, the SSC2 now also controls the active dampers which renders the car’s dynamic behaviour during complex manoeuvres even flatter and more stable.  Designed by the Ferrari Styling Centre, the new car features very sculptural flanks which are the key to its character. Its large signature air intake scallop is a nod to the original 308 GTB and is divided into two sections by a splitter. The wide front spoiler features a double profile to improve the thermal efficiency of the radiators positioned at the sides. At the centre two pylons are combined with a deflector which channels air towards the flat underbody. The broad, low tail is also dominated by aerodynamic solutions, including an innovative blown spoiler which generates downforce without increasing drag. This works in conjunction with an aggressive ramp angle for the diffuser which features active flaps. The greater height required for the diffuser was achieved by repositioning the exhaust tailpipes. The circular LED tail lights have also been redesigned.  In the cabin, the seamless integration of the new satellite control clusters, angled air vents and instrument panel heightens the sense that the cockpit is completely tailored around the driver. Usability was the key word in the design, leading to an extremely sporty ambience that in no way compromises on comfort. There are plenty of classic Ferrari styling elements too, such as the clear separation between the dashboard and tunnel, the multifunctional steering wheel, the control switch bridge and wraparound seats. The graphics and interface of the infotainment screen have also been completely redesigned while the design of the car’s new key takes its inspiration from the car’s cylinder banks and allows keyless starts.  The Ferrari 488 GTB will make its world debut at the International Geneva Motor Show in March, but from today can be seen at www.ferrari.com.

Look at the veyron tires as a good example of high speed sports car tire use.   Indycar tires have to be changed roughly every 30-50 miles and they are turning constantly at speeds between 220 and 240 mph, very rarely do we get blowouts anymore.  I think the real question is where are you going to find a place you can take a corner at 300 mph and not black out.  Don't think that kind of banking exists (graduated)  besides a top end speed statement is always in a straightline"
Ferrari,2ta440,hotsizzlepancakes,1 point,Thu Jan 22 18:15:20 2015 UTC,"The Veyron's tires will shred after 15 minutes at top speed. And that speed is 267 mph, which is still far below 300 mph.  300 mph is much different than 200 mph, which is much different than 100 mph. The stresses and friction that those tires go through are much greater the faster you go.   They don't make tires that you can go 300 mph at, have them not shred and explode, and then turn around and use them normally for another month.  As for cornering at 300 mph, I don't think even an F1 car could do that."

Ferrari,2t8k04,user812,2,Thu Jan 22 01:09:43 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I don't own a Ferrari and everything i say from this point onward is NOT from my direct experience with a Ferrari.  If im not mistaken, the clutch engagement on a 360 is similar to a traditional manual transmission, except the computer controls it. This is a guess, but i know this is how the 2007 M6 handles clutch engagement. Dry clutches are used in these types of systems. The computer slips the clutch as it engages to put the car in motion. Auto mode slips more to be smooth, sport modes slip less and engage sooner to be more responsive. Sport mode will probably prolong clutch life because less slip = longer life. Reverse also puts a beating on clutches in these types of systems because of constant slippage.   The dual clutch systems are different because they are essentially two transmissions combined along with two clutches. One trans handles even gears and the other handles odd gears. Clutches in these systems are bathed in oil and are called wet clutches. Wet clutches are essentially immune to damage from clutch slip. Many motorcycles use wet clutches and slipping the clutch is highly encouraged and promoted in the motorcycle community. Of course, everything in moderation.  On the 360 you should be able to last a few years with the F1 clutch. From what i hear its maybe 5% wear per 2000 miles. They can last 50k miles if you keep it out of traffic, avoid overheating it, and are conservative with reversing. People say to put it in neutral at lights to prolong clutch life as well as having it adjusted every time you get the car maintained by a qualified professional. This is essentially the core of the issue, whether or not the clutch was installed correctly AND if adjustments were made along the life of the clutch to minimize slip and prolong its effectiveness before a replacement is needed.  Get it installed right and adjusted often and it should last a while.  Reminder: I don't own a Ferrari and everything I have said is the result of research and experience with other similar cars."
Ferrari,2t8k04,Rocket_Potato,3,Thu Jan 22 02:28:52 2015 UTC,"/u/Rocket_Potato is essentially correct. You can make the single clutch F1 systems last a long time if you drive them like you would any regular manual (if you are doing it correctly). That usually means driving them in manual mode to reduce slip. Parallel parking - especially on a hill is about the worst thing you can do to one. However, they don't usually need adjustment if set up correctly when installed. There are sensors that track wear and give the transmission computer information how much material is left so it knows where the friction point should occur. That initial setup is critical though. You can also inspect the clutch via a small port (in the 360 anyway) and visually check for wear, etc.   We purchased a 360CS with about 12K on the clock and a fresh clutch. It's now at 22K miles (mostly at the track), and the clutch shows 75 to 80% of clutch remaining.   The F430 system is very similar. Interestingly the transmission in the F430 Challenge cars was taken from the 360CS. A simpler more mechanical system apparently, that worked better in the racing environment."

Ferrari,2seuec,BlueHuracan,2,Thu Jan 15 13:23:12 2015 UTC,I'll try to eventually create both the testa and p3; I'll be sure to let you know once they're completed !

Ferrari,2s8i6k,mullinerparkward,7,Tue Jan 13 02:17:07 2015 UTC,"Seems to me they've gotten about as low as they're going to get, and the appreciation could come in 1 year, or 10 years, or more.  No way to know.  Personally, I'm starting to eyeball the 612's because I just love the subtlety of them.  I think those have a year or two left and they'll also be a steal."
Ferrari,2s8i6k,ntmatter,2,Tue Jan 13 02:33:42 2015 UTC,"I think now is a pretty good time. I would highly recommend looking for a manual though. The 575m is the last front engine v12 car offered with a stick by Ferrari, and I think that will be a huge selling point in the future for purists, and simply because the F1 box was really nothing special."

Ferrari,2s8i6k,Onlinealias,1 point,Wed Jan 14 02:20:16 2015 UTC,"50K for a TR?  There are a few out there in that range.  I would be scared of the PPI report.  Purchasing cost is usually just the entry fee of Ferrari ownership.  Still, estimate around a buck a mile, once the car, insurance, and gas are paid.  That helps budget long term repairs, and little bits that stop working.  612's are dipping below 100K.  If you can find a good 575M, by all means, go for it!  Fantastic cars."
Ferrari,2s8i6k,whoapower,3,Wed Jan 14 17:54:24 2015 UTC,"Two years ago it seemed like that was the going rate for a good one, bought well (patiently).  I haven't really looked too hard lately, but I thinks prices have firmed up.    I'm planning on a similar budget for a Ferrari as for my Bentley - ""You can't afford to drive one unless you can afford the purchase price several times over"" Either way I'd rather pay R&M on a used car than depreciation on a new one."

Ferrari,2rr450,tifosiv122,4,Thu Jan 8 16:18:19 2015 UTC,"I don't mind turbos (at least on the V8 engines) but I do think that naturally aspirated engines are more...impressive I guess.  A NA engine is like someone running on a treadmill for a long distance, whereas a Turbo engine is like someone running on the same treadmill but hooked up to an oxygen tank. It's not necessarily ""cheating"" but I don't find it as impressive and spunky as a NA engine.  I think the hybrid V12 is the way to go. It's more powerful, more passionate, more beautiful, and ultimately more environmentally friendly than turbos. Plus, you just can't beat that instant torque."

The F360 is a great Ferrari, way less maintenence than the 355; However, if you aren't stuck on wanting a red, mid Engined Ferrari, I would consider spending a little more, and possibly getting into a 550M - Ebay Listing Often they can be had for under $100k (this one just had it's major timing belt and fluid changes), and nothing sounds better than a V12 Ferrari. Ferrari Chat 550M 456M is another option, but is a very love/hate Ferrari.   Also, if you haven't yet, I would head over to FerrariChat.com and lurk in the for sale sections, I have seen some really good deals on great cars there. You've been spoiled with the NSX's low maintenance, as you're well aware, these cars need proper care. I'd get my posts up on there then even consider listing the NSX on there as well, there is some serious money on that site. Good luck, get a Ferrari certified Mechanic's PPI, and I really hope to see what you end up with!"

Ferrari,2rruim,BroasisMusic,2,Thu Jan 8 23:12:01 2015 UTC,"Oh lord, the maintenance costs between the 355 and the 360 is night and day. A lot of service on the 355 is ""engine out"", not to mention some of the more common build-quality concerns like the crappy thin and prone to cracking (expensive) exhaust manifolds will set you back a quite large stack of bills, too. Honestly, from nearly every standpoint the 360 is a better car, and will be considerably cheaper to run. The 355 is in an odd place right now. The older Ferraris are becoming more classic and more desired, but the newer Ferraris are much cheaper to maintain, much more reliable, and much faster. The 355 kind of sits in the middle. It strikes me as the type of Ferrari someone with just enough money buys, only to be sucked broke by maintenance. That being said, the 355 is still strikingly beautiful for being 15 years old, but hot damn the maintenance costs just aren't worth it..."
Ferrari,2rruim,BroasisMusic,1 point,Tue Jan 13 05:54:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice.  I really appreciate it.  And I'm a little (pleasantly) surprised, because I figured all the new-fangled tech in the newer Ferrari's would make them more expense to maintain.  Shows what I know."
Ferrari,2rruim,Onlinealias,1 point,Tue Jan 13 15:11:28 2015 UTC,"All this being said, I have to say I like the looks and sound of the 355 about 100x better than the 360. Maintenance issues aside, it's a car I'd love to have in my stable. Just be careful with the car you choose, have a PPI of your choosing on it and make sure it's done by an F-car expert. Honestly, I don't know if I'd ever be a 360 buyer though unless it was a challenge stradale. The 430 is just miles ahead of it in technology, power, luxury, and looks, and really by now the 430's have come down to the mid-low 100's... not terribly higher than a well-maintained 360 which still pushes 6 figures."
Ferrari,2rruim,charlesca,1 point,Tue Jan 13 15:23:36 2015 UTC,"You can buy one with an F1 tranny quite a bit cheaper, and I wouldn't let one scare me a bit.  A little bit of research if something goes wrong and you will find that they are quite easy and cheap to deal with.    In short, buy an F1 and get it cheap because everyone is scared of it for no real reason.  However, I agree with the above poster...front engine Ferraris are sublime and probably the only ones I would actually buy."
Ferrari,2rruim,itsGecko,4,Fri Jan 9 01:35:03 2015 UTC,NSX value is increasing so you will easily get $45k+ for your car.  I almost got double what I paid when I sold my NSX 6 months ago.  F355 has lots of annoying issues is not as reliable as the 360 but the F355 sounds a lot better though.
Ferrari,2rruim,TheSherbs,3,Thu Jan 8 22:17:36 2015 UTC,I like the F360 most.
Ferrari,2rruim,bullet50000,2,Thu Jan 8 19:54:46 2015 UTC,"Purely from the standpoint of maintenance, which is more practical, the F355 or the F360?   The 360. Depending on how long you plan on keeping it, the 355 will have an engine out service, and that IS a $10K service bill. The 360 has service intervals as well, but nothing that requires the engine to be pulled unless something catastrophic has happened."
Ferrari,2rruim,10b-5,1 point,Thu Jan 8 22:30:41 2015 UTC,"If you plan on maintenance being a big part of what you do unquestionably go for the 360. Ferrari of New England at one point had service prices up on their website, and I think I remember the belt service for a 360 Modena being $2499 and the same for an F355 being like $6999"
Ferrari,2rruim,BlueHuracan,1 point,Fri Jan 9 03:43:58 2015 UTC,"When it comes to maintenance for Ferrari, there's a massive premium the older the car gets. So yeah, 360 is a hell of a lot better in that regard than the 355. (And the 430 even more so, etc)"

Ferrari,2ps7zp,RapistNextDoor,6,Sat Dec 20 06:58:30 2014 UTC,I say four five eight to keep the syllables right. So for the 360 and 430 I say three sixty and four thirty because three syllables
Ferrari,2ps7zp,papijaja,2,Fri Dec 19 13:16:19 2014 UTC,"Actually, 3.60 and 4.30 are totally right."
Ferrari,2ps7zp,gotfondue,4,Sat Dec 20 00:24:03 2014 UTC,"In this video (the unveiling of the 458 Speciale Aperta by Luca di Montezemolo, former chairman of Ferrari) it's pronounced ""four-five-eight."" So I guess that's the most official response you can get.  Personally I've always pronounced it ""four-five-eight"" and that's how I've heard it pronounced most often."

Ferrari,2ps7zp,A-Pod,2,Fri Dec 19 14:58:29 2014 UTC,SO why wasn't the 360 the 368
Ferrari,2ps7zp,earlofsandwich,2,Fri Dec 19 17:23:11 2014 UTC,"Upon introduction of the 360 Modena, the digits for V8 models (which now carried a name as well as a number) refer only to total engine displacement."
Ferrari,2ps7zp,A-Pod,2,Fri Dec 19 18:44:11 2014 UTC,"Because the 360 and the F430 didn't use the ""8"" in their naming scheme. It was only the displacement of the engine."

Ferrari,2om4ir,jetshockeyfan,2,Mon Dec 8 18:13:40 2014 UTC,depends on what do you mean by real. If it was official merchandise? or if was a team jacket? actually worn by a team member? worn by a driver? worn by Schumacher? worn by Schumacher during the 2004 Brazilian GP?  But just to have an idea official merchandise jackets at the Ferrari store go from something like 250 to 1200 for a nice leather jacket

I currently don't own any, but my dad does. I have always changed my fluids at regular intervals, whether it be in a Ferrari or a Chevrolet. In my experience Ferraris work like Beretta pistols. They are meant to be run hard. However, I tend to run my vehicles hard regardless of the make  or expense, and regardless of the setting, so I may just be lucky, who knows."

Ask your father about the service (from Ferrari): The factory specifies service intervals of 15,000 miles, which includes a tune-up and valve adjustment. The 30,000-mile services are the big ones and involve the removal and reinstallation of the engine, along with replacement of the water pump, the timing belts, ignition parts, the clutch linings, various seals and hoses. ya, sounds like a chevy to me too..."
Ferrari,2nzrgs,CappnKrunk,-2,Tue Dec 2 06:28:26 2014 UTC,"Yes, I've owned a 430 Spider and a Mondial T. Both were gifts from my father. I personally could not afford the service on the 430 so I sold it, and the Mondial was a mechanical nightmare from the beginning. I have personally watched the engine removal via webcam from Ferrari Ft. Lauterdale. One of the reasons that dealership is actually there is because my uncle lives a couple of miles away and was very involved in Formula 1 a few decades ago. I never compared a Ferrari to a Chevrolet, I simply said I have regular maintenance and upkeep performed on all of my cars regardless of make. I didn't mean to offend."

You can't just change drivers, or change the complete engine-layout, or gearbox or whatever. Everything is restricted. Only thing he could do was waiting for the season to end, and start clean next year. Ferrari should know it too, so therefor my guess is this was planned all along."

Ferrari,2lqw1d,tifosiv122,2,Sun Nov 9 15:26:04 2014 UTC,"I don't think I'd ever seen a 308 in Giallo before, and it looks fantastic!  I, too, had to take the Modenese car out yesterday with my driving group, and we had a wonderful time... My F355, one 550, a Boxster and an Elise. Whereabouts are you located? If you're in NorCal - specifically the Sac area, we want you to drive with us in that beauty!"
Ferrari,2lq3nl,jberd45,8,Sun Nov 9 01:29:35 2014 UTC,"I can't put into words how expensive the parts are, seriously. And they weren't designed with serviceability in mind, so you may end up picking up new tools to do random tasks like get to that damn bolt behind that - why is this bolt here?? Who does this!? Why do I have to pull the engine to replace the muffler bearings!?   Jokes aside, working on old Ferraris is fun if you have a looooot of money. It's extremely frustrating otherwise. I hope I didn't turn you off too much, but I kinda hope I did. I may have saved your marriage."
Ferrari,2lq3nl,tathata,5,Sun Nov 9 03:35:29 2014 UTC,"This and worse when parts are not available no matter the cost. I've experienced this on my '86 & '87, but my '95 just had an issue and I was told from the dealer the part is NLA. Now you need to find NOS ($$$$) or junk yard parts. Not easy, fun, or cheap.   There are some positives. Generally a lot of parts are from other vehicle... BMW, for example is the interior door handle for 80s Monials. Ferrari chat has good cross reference lists.   Mechanically they aren't anything magical - any mechanic can work on them. Of course the more you see the easier the 'quirks' are too figure out."

Ferrari,2lq3nl,whoapower,1 point,Sun Nov 9 04:13:55 2014 UTC,"Ditto to tathata & tifosiv122's posts.  There are no impossible tasks, some just take time and specialized tools.  Some you can fab up yourself, or some might be a really large hex wrench.  Wrenching can be fun, it takes time, but yes frustrating at times.  When you start looking at prices for a 3x8 model, it skews the price point on everything in your mind.  Some things for other cars that seemed expensive are now ""reasonable"".  But not everything must be sourced as a Ferrari part.  To give you an example, when I have time this Dec, I need to pull my alternator out on the 348 and rebuild it.  I haven't done one before, but it isn't a difficult task.  I figure 60-80 bucks tops for parts once I confirm what I need to source.  If I wanted a new one, that's $2,304.64 from RicambiAmerica!  (http://www.ricambiamerica.com/product_info.php?products_id=203282)  I think I'll spend the time doing it myself.  As cars get older, some of the pieces are no longer available.  www.unobtainiumsupply.com is a guy from fchat who reproduces pieces that are no longer made, can be found, or ones that just break easily.  If you are in the market, by all means, go for it.  There's a story and adventure with just about everything you do with the car, and right now the prices are currently ticking up on the 308's and 328's as they age a little further.  They'll soon be up well above your 50K mark."

I find it very easy to work on. By comparison my Alfa Milano is over-complicated and a real bitch to diagnose and repair. Having said all that, you still need to pull the engine in the 348 every 3-5 years, so not the best choice if you're on a budget."

I would be terribly sad to see Ferrari become Lamborghini and start making economic cars. Ferrari is Ferrari because of their absolute love for racing and excellence. Their history and passion is incredible. This guy just sees money and no passion. Hopefully he isn't an idiot and destroys what the brand stands for. I would personally no longer be interested in buying a new Ferrari if they start whoring  themselves out. I would just go old school and buy used.   If Montezemolo doesn't like the idea or guy after knowing him personally, I would garner that this is bad news. Montezemolo was the closest thing Ferrari has to Enzo himself in today's world.   Edit: fixed a couple typos."

There will always be ppl to buy whatever they put out, they will just lose their authenticity somewhat amongst their hard core crowd. They are Ferrari for a reason. Not Lambo. Not Porsche. Not Bugatti. No one I feel has the prestige quite like Ferrari. Sure they other manufacturers put out great cars. None feel as passionate as Ferrari. Just my bit.

If you have 10 ferraris that you bought from a dealership, but never actually do anything with them, how will ferrari even know about you? However if you had lets say an f50 and an Enzo, and you would show up to car meets, and such, and other ferrari events, im sure youre chance of buying a LaFerrari is much higher.  It's all based on how loyal you are to the company, and how prominent you are in the ferrari world."
Ferrari,2k8bf2,Harain,5,Sat Oct 25 04:28:18 2014 UTC,"It absolutely does. From the article "" Rumor has it that customers must already own five Ferraris to even be considered, and more than that is advised."" An owner of a single new Ferrari going to car shows will not be selected. Minimum of 5 new ones with a history of buying. They don't care about people attending shows or anything else. Buy and hold not resell. Serviced at the dealership only. Not leased. Not financed.   They are looking for owners who don't flip the cars.   I own (owned, sold 3 recently) 5 Ferrari's and attend almost every FCA event. I get my cars serviced at an authorized dealership.

The 458 Speciale will still have the power advantage, though a bit less so, and the weights will be very close. The 458 Speciale is fantastic and I'd say more of a thrilling experience, but the Porsche is a master of corners so I think it'd be real close and can't predict the winner.

I would highly suggest a clear bra on the entire front of the car, ask around locally for some one that does it and dont skimp or you will regret it.  if you tap both the shifters at the same time it will drop you into neutral and you can rev it and then re engage into gear by shifting up  trickle charger on it if you're leaving it sit for more than a week, the plug is under the dash on the passenger side against the sidewall where the door meets the frame.   never done the power start, but becareful turning off traction control all the way... i do not recommend. It's going to handle about 10x better than your average lambo.  be careful putting fuel in her, its a little gimmicky getting the nosel to fit and you can do some damage  If you track it do so under a ""drivers education"" event otherwise you will void your warranty, which on this is a 7 year version. it looks like you live in vegas so i would never track this car, just go to dream racing and drive the F430 GT / challenge cars, its more fun than driving a stock 458.  If you want to put turbos on her there are a bunch of different stages you can do, the guys in austin can rig that up for you. Honestly i see no sense as you can have more fun in a challenge car than you can boosting the shit out of a stock.  other than that, enjoy her"

Capristo if you want that loud rumble and growl sound. Both exhaust sound amazing depends on what the owner prefers. Here's a tip don't lock yourself in the trunk

There will be purists who complain about it, and keep and favour the old, but technology moves forward. There is a flaw with ICE that lacks torque various RPM, electric motors are the fix to fill in the holes."
Ferrari,2ijle9,Porsche924,1 point,Tue Oct 7 13:41:01 2014 UTC,"Yes, but if everyone is coming up with new tech, it'll speed the process up for innovation in electric technology. So lets say we can get a battery that is half the size/weight. First thing they'll do is double the capacity so it weighs the same. But once they get to a point where they don't NEED to put more capacity it, the batteries will start getting smaller and lighter.   If hypercar and racing teams are trying to gain an edge to win at any cost, they'll find a way to make it all work."

Ferrari,2g2jy6,tifosiv122,1 point,Thu Sep 11 05:42:41 2014 UTC,I'm really leaning towards the 348 myself. I love the looks and it has the power I want. Hard part is finding a good condition 348 TS in red with tan interior.
Ferrari,2g2jy6,SupaSupra,1 point,Thu Sep 11 06:59:39 2014 UTC,"Without a doubt that is the right move. The 348 is grossly undervalued as most Ferrari 'purists' don't like them. They are quick (not fast) and oodles of fun. If you push them too hard they will spin so you need to be a decent driver.   Rosso / Tan TS is the easiest one to find.   I've had 6 Ferrari's, the 348 is the one that will be with me until I die."
Ferrari,2g2jy6,tifosiv122,1 point,Thu Sep 11 13:31:28 2014 UTC,I absolutely love the 348. Its has similar styling to the Testarossa but doesn't have the costs that the Testarossa does.
Ferrari,2g2jy6,SupaSupra,1 point,Fri Sep 12 04:05:26 2014 UTC,"It goes beyond that. I was originally going to buy a testarossa. I was lucky that the owner of the one I was going to buy let me drive it first. It's a very difficult car to drive. Its much, much bigger than you think it is. Hard angles to see out of.   The 348 is extremely easy to drive around with. I take mine everywhere including trips to the supermarket where I can pickup small items. A teastarossa is a pain to park as well.   Don't get me wrong, it's breathtaking, but it's not a car if you are actually going to drive it. Let's be honest, they should be driven."
Ferrari,2g2jy6,joeyx09,1 point,Fri Sep 12 04:34:39 2014 UTC,"Oh wow. I've only gotten to see Testarossas. Never actually been in one. I'd drive a 348 quite often for sure.

Ferrari,2fzo78,Jerome92,7,Wed Sep 10 09:05:18 2014 UTC,"Completely gutted by the news. Besides Enzo, he was probably the most Ferrari-man ever. He did a great job as head of the company and can be proud of his achievemens. With him leaving I fear for Ferrari's future. It's well known he's the one that veto'd a Panamera/Rapide rival and an SUV. With Marchionne at the reigns, I'm afraid Ferrari isn't going to be Ferrari anymore."
Ferrari,2fzo78,Blanchimont,3,Wed Sep 10 10:14:50 2014 UTC,"I agree, however it really depends on how you view Ferrari now. For me, they haven't been the same since dropping the gated shifters. Don't get me wrong, the 458 is beautiful, it's just not the same...  Sad to see him go - he did love the company."
Ferrari,2fzo78,tifosiv122,2,Wed Sep 10 12:13:30 2014 UTC,"I had the privilege to drive the 458, and it definetely feels super analogic. Let's hope that Enzo's will of no four-doors and no diesel cars will be respected (I guess so, they already have problems of exclusivity because they sell too much).

Ferrari,2eunke,redditor1983,3,Thu Aug 28 20:00:39 2014 UTC,"Yeah, they're referred to as ""battery conditioners"" usually. Lots of exotic cars come with them because many exotic car owners keep their car sitting in a garage for weeks (or more) at a time, and only drive it rarely.   If you do that, the battery will obviously die. A battery conditioner provides a small ""trickle charge"" that prevents this."
Ferrari,2eunke,uber_neutrino,2,Thu Aug 28 22:20:30 2014 UTC,"Because nobody ever drives their ferrari.  This is actually a common topic of conversation amongst those who own these kinds of cars (hey jim, what kind of battery tender do you use? etc)."
Ferrari,2eunke,carguy84,2,Thu Aug 28 22:42:09 2014 UTC,"It's a 3 amp tender.  Modern Ferrari's don't use any more battery power at rest than other cars, but because the majority sit for so long, it's an easy way to keep the battery conditioned.  The cars also require a lot of battery power to start, so having a fresh battery keeps you out of the Dealer with the dreaded ""Engine Control System Failure"" codes."
Ferrari,2eunke,charlesca,2,Thu Aug 28 23:35:33 2014 UTC,"Battery tenders keep the battery charged.  On the 360, you can't just jump start the dead battery or you will blow out your dash cluster ($$$)."

Based off my experience I'd have to say each dealership is different.  My local dealership did little to nothing to make sure I was happy.  They called me to let me know of service appointments and also to let me know about events but that was it.  No post sale call or anything.  Ferrari North America never called, wrote, or anything.  Ferrari isn't known for stellar customer service.  Their service department tends to be great but their sales department is very hit or miss and generally leans more on the miss side.  Aston Martin on the other hand was excellent from sales to service!  They still contact me regularly when new car models come in to test drive them and it's been 3 years since I owned one.  They also send me magazines and materials multiple times a year.  McLaren is also very very good as well."

Ferrari,2dd8hu,rlothar,4,Wed Aug 13 02:33:45 2014 UTC,"One thing to remember is Ferrari have 0 issues selling cars as the demand is always higher than the supply, by design.  They actually are restricting the amount of cars they make per year to keep the car more exclusive.  They also make more money on merchandise than cars or racing.  It's not a model I would follow but their cars are amazing and an experience of a lifetime  McLaren or Aston Martin on the other hand are not in the situation and need to retain business and grow.  Their focus on owners and prospects makes you want to stop in just to say hi.  They invite me to track days, new car launches, test drives, cocktail dinners, and even say happy birthday :).  In this day and age, customers opinion is incredibly important.  Social media has given people a much stronger voice so I recommend you continue doing what you do and build relationships with people.  Their  positive experiences will only bring you more business and positive reviews!  As far as what I do, I do consulting in the software development space."

However, I completely agree with rlothar. Ferrari is pretty much the worst when it comes to after sales. When I bought my Ferrari in 2009, I believe I got one email from the salesman checking in and that was it. Definitely nothing from Ferrari North America other than emails about events where I could spend more money. Nothing about satisfaction. I do get invites to come by for events where they unveil new models. That's not bad.  Porsche on the other hand have been a completely different story. I've had 2 different 911s. One regular Carrera S and then a GT3 RS. Even after the regular S, I'd get random nice stuff from them: books showing new models, personalized items, check ins on how things were going. Then after the RS, I got a rather nice package introducing the 918 Spyder with a book about the car. It also came with an invitation to speak to their former race driver about the car and someone to contact if I wanted to purchase. At one point my salesman offered free tickets to a popular car show. Since I couldn't swing by to pick them up, they fedex'd the tickets to me. Lots of little things like that.  Ferrari couldn't be bothered, their new models always have buyers waiting in line. They know you'll be back, and if not, someone else will."

The side markers on a real 288 GTO  are actually conical in shape and they are inset into the quarter panel, whereas this one appears to be cylindrical and set on top of it. Also, the turn signals on the front bumper are backwards (white should be on the outside, not the inside of the two)."

Ferrari,2c2xqe,samyinaferrari,1 point,Tue Jul 29 21:32:30 2014 UTC,"Looking at your pictures I can see you are from Calgary. Are you new to Canada? I hope this does not sound rude or anything but I'm just curious because it surprises me that you believe this might be the only 458 in western Canada. Calgary has one of the highest supercars/capita ratios in the world and is also one of the richest cities in the world. There are countless 458s cruising throughout Alberta.  Also, just incase you are in fact new to calgary, you should keep your eyes pealed for the f40, f50 and Enzos that occasionally cruise about the streets. There used to even be an mc12 although from what I hear, it seems it's now located in Edmonton.   Anyways, happy hunting! I hope this is not the last 458 you see this season!"
Ferrari,2c2xqe,needfourspeed,1 point,Wed Jul 30 19:06:54 2014 UTC,"Born and raised Calgarian.   It's the first 458 Spider (convertible) in Western Canada, been hoping to run into it for a few months now when it first was delivered to Ferrari of Alberta (dealer in town) and then was sold. The driver looks like one of the managers at the dealer as well.  I have ""raced"" many cars in town in my R1 including the two enzos I've seen around (yellow and red; the red is owned by the same man that owns this 458 Spider and the yellow is of a rich CEO, both are very good drivers. I watched them go through and under the train line in bowness at over 120mph and in my bike I was only comfortable going 90mph.)   I know of a F40 and Diablo that's both wrapped different every summer seemingly. The owner of the shop that wrapped them owns a FXX that's been made street legal and I saw it last year but he didn't want to race me haha. The shop is ZR Auto if you wanna check it out."

There are good ones, with zero issues, nothing needs to be done at all, but they are still 50-70K at the moment.  A grand or two isn't much of a difference, especially given that as a Ferrari, it will still cost you a buck a mile, even as a DIYer due to things stop working or maintenance.

I would venture to guess having the roof on in this car made driver changes during endurance races nigh impossible considering the seating position and overall height of the car. That's why the GT40 had a massive roof cutout attached to the door, so you could get in and out."

Ferrari,28xafh,Nasarri_B,5,Tue Jun 24 05:07:44 2014 UTC,Yes. It is the previous model in the Mid-Engined V8 segment. Before it was the 360 Modena/Spider/Challenge Stradale. Its also a special edition being the Scuderia 16M which celebrates the 16th Constructor's Championship win by Ferrari. Being the Scuderia would make it closer to the Gallardo Superleggera or Spyder Performante in terms of Lamborghini as well if you want to get really specific.

Ferrari,25mf8f,uluru,3,Thu May 15 13:12:46 2014 UTC,"Here is the profile and interior.  This car - chassis number 0224 AT - was the most successful of the three cars designed by Carrozzeria Vignale for Ferrari to be dispatched to Mexico for the ""Carrera Panamericana"" Mexican road race. The original 1950-54 competition was the most dangerous road race in the world, seeing 27 racers killed on the new Panamerican Highway, with many more spectator fatalities that sadly went unrecorded. A huge crash by Pierre Levegh in 1955 killed an estimated 80 track-side fans in one incident alone.    Looking back, it was a shockingly dangerous race, with a course of over 2100 miles over nine stages in five days, most of the endurance race took place between 5000-8000 feet above sea level, and guard-rails were not a luxury the racers could rely on. The original 1950-54 competition was the most dangerous road race in the world, seeing 27 racers killed on the new Panamerican Highway, with many more spectator fatalities that sadly went unrecorded. A huge crash by Pierre Levegh in 1955 killed an estimated 80 track-side fans in one incident alone. The average speed for the last 227 mile stage of the 1950 race was 138mph - on public roads.  So, the racing world was enthralled by the spectacle of the Carrera Panamericana, and with the spotlight on the race, Ferrari knew the 1952 edition would be fiercely contested. Porsche was in, Mercedes had a few 300SL Gullwing prototypes they were keen on, so Ferrari went to the drawing board. They took Aurelio Lampredi's long-block 4.0L V12 340 America that had just one the 1951 Mille Miglia and produced three lightweight 340 coupes - all named ""Mexico"" for the race.  So, this car was then driven by three-time Le Mans winner Luigi Chinetti and his co-driver Jean Lucas, they would go on to clinch third place in the 1952 race, still running temporary Italian plates. A pretty gorgeous car (that has to be one of the longest hoods on a Ferrari ever) with an interesting heritage. It sold for $4.3 million at auction in 2011, and if you would like to see the full 22 picture set, I've just posted it up at /r/thewholecar."

I see people constantly talking about how they're going to buy a 355 or a 360 because they found one that they can just barely afford the purchase price of.  What they don't realize, is that Ferraris being sold cheap usually have problems, and problems aren't cheap to fix.  If you think you can just barely afford to buy a $60-80k 360, you can't afford to maintain it."
Ferrari,24wvjk,Fidget11,2,Wed May 7 22:18:25 2014 UTC,To be honest my career path that I'm currently on will treat me good but I also hope that the price of a 360 or F430 will depreciate a bit so that it isn't so much of a stress on me and so I can afford to maintain it and fix it if needed.

If you buy at a low price, you will end up needing to sink in another 5-20K into it to make it right.  Many neglected Ferraris are out there on the market going for low balling dollars right now.  The other thing to note, besides the modern Ferraris, 430 and up (due to chains vs. belts), once the car, insurance, and gas is paid for, there is still a cost per mile.  It's around a buck, give or take twenty cents.  Reason being, there's always something that might break, that needs to be tended to, or something silly that just doesn't work right.

Ferrari,20euxs,FixerBiscuit,3,Fri Mar 14 16:54:49 2014 UTC,"this has always scared me about a 355. Even though I want one, I would NEVER be able to keep it going, even with my job as a pharmacist"
Ferrari,20euxs,bullet50000,1 point,Sat Mar 15 05:22:50 2014 UTC,"This car has taken so much more money than I thought it would out of our savings, but it's my hobby and passion, and my wife has been just incredibly understanding when it comes to our ""problem child"".  I wonder, because of its timeless looks and high maintenance costs, if well-running examples of this model will become classics, and desirable in 10 or 15 years. I plan on keeping it until I die, or until it's worth more than I would feel comfortable driving it anymore. :-)   Time will tell, I suppose!"
Ferrari,20euxs,bullet50000,2,Sat Mar 15 23:01:12 2014 UTC,"I'm very tempted, with it's easier maintainence, to get a 360 instead of a 355. Either that or a 328"
Ferrari,20euxs,bullet50000,1 point,Sun Mar 16 02:15:03 2014 UTC,"If I were just buying a car now, I'd say it's no contest - get the 360. While it's a little more expensive to buy, you'll save all of it, and more, in maintenance costs if you plan on keeping it for 5+ years. There's also much less of a stigma against racking up high mileage on the 360s, as the car was perceived as being more reliable. Plus,if you're thinking of Spiders, there's the extra bonus of being able to track the car, because it has adequate rollover protection. How I'd love to be able to track mine just once or twice a year, but alas..."
Ferrari,20euxs,bullet50000,2,Sun Mar 16 13:15:40 2014 UTC,"I'm actually thinking of daily driving it, so yeah a 360 should be much better"
Ferrari,20euxs,rTec9,2,Sun Mar 16 16:23:40 2014 UTC,"Most definitely, although Ferraris are difficult to daily drive - depending on where you work, I guess. Leaving the car unattended for 8+ hours isn't usually wise, especially in a down economy, and in a society where people are told that the wealthy people are to blame for all their problems. No matter how much you've sacrificed to obtain your car, the general population just assumes that it magically appeared in your driveway, and a few will get angry about it. Not many, but there are some. And a few of those will consider doing something bad to the car if they feel they won't get caught.   This is why I wouldn't bring it to a movie theater, for example. Someone who sees me leave the car in the lot knows they have 3 hours alone with it. It's one of the reasons I'd considered letting it go in favor of something a less attention-gathering, but I love how it drives so much, that I haven't yet been able to part with it.  Consider having something else - doesn't have to be expensive (I've had an MR2 Spyder and 350Z as a daily drivers, for example) - to blend in during the week, and then thrash the Ferrari on the weekends. It makes drives in the Ferrari even more special."
Ferrari,20euxs,bullet50000,1 point,Mon Mar 17 14:41:30 2014 UTC,I am at least thankful its much nicer for nice cars in America than Britain. I have a few British friends who say how owning an expensive car there can bring tire slashers and people sticking knives in your ragtop quite often.

I went riding with a friend in his 550 yesterday, and he lives on a secluded, relatively wealthier dead-end street about 10 miles from here, and he's said he once, by mistake, left the car, unlocked, with the keys in it, overnight, and it was right where he left it in the morning..."

Ferrari,20euxs,Jane_E,1 point,Wed Mar 19 04:32:03 2014 UTC,"Maybe it's because I was born and raised in Northern NJ, but I've never been able to understand things like leaving a car running when running into a store for a few minutes (something a coworker of mine in Plano, TX did a couple weeks ago and someone took the car!), or leaving the doors unlocked at night when sleeping.  The way I've always figured is, if I make it more difficult for someone to steal from me than my neighbors do, then thieves will go there instead. The problem for me is that the car makes people think I have nicer stuff in my house, which, honestly, I don't."
Ferrari,20euxs,ninjatune,2,Wed Mar 19 14:54:32 2014 UTC,"Wow, I thought these things were invincible because it's a Ferrari. Nice to see a car like this being so immaculately maintained."
Ferrari,20euxs,ninjatune,14,Fri Mar 14 17:09:56 2014 UTC,"Oh, my goodness, you have no idea how vulnerable... to EVERYTHING... these cars can be! Starting with the 360, reliability and overall build quality got a lot better, but I always explain the F355 as being part of Ferrari's ""awkward teenage phase"" between cars with no electronics and cars with LOTS of electronics. So there are lots of quirks.  This major service, and all the little minor bits that I'm having looked at while it's in the shop for months on end, has well exceeded my planned budget for it, but things come up, and as the caretaker and steward of this car, it's my responsibility to do as much as I can to keep it working as best I can.  Mine has over 38,000 miles now, which means I've put 21,000 on it since I bought it just under 7 years ago. It'll never be a museum piece - it's got lots of rock chips, and I won't even show you pics of the crack in the front bumper and the scuffs on the bottom of that bumper. I can't afford to have a car just to look at it.  So, for as long as it stays with me, I'll enjoy the hell out of it, and if it costs me all of my discretionary money (it does, and then some!), so be it. I'm having fun. :)  That said, if you buy a Ferrari, get something newer. It'll be cheaper to maintain and run, will be more reliable, quicker, and faster."

Ferrari,201fwi,DanielPerianu,1 point,Mon Mar 10 14:08:24 2014 UTC,Excuse my ignorance.  There is a market for replica vehicles? Aren't there obvious tells that reveal its not a genuine car?
Ferrari,201fwi,DanielPerianu,3,Mon Mar 10 17:53:19 2014 UTC,"People actually buy replicas knowing they aren't genuine. If you can't afford $200,000+ for a vintage Ferrari, to some people having a replica is the next best thing and are willing to pay pretty decent prices for them.   I've seen a replica Lamborghini Countach with a V8 from a corvette go for $60,000."
Ferrari,201fwi,TNightster,1 point,Mon Mar 10 20:07:18 2014 UTC,That is crazy... Im going to assume they arent replicated very well? Are they?   And im also going to assume they arent seen very well by genuine car collectors.
Ferrari,201fwi,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Mar 10 20:13:32 2014 UTC,"D, I believe there are actually two schools of thought here.   First, there is the mindset of how to replicate something to the closest degree possible. Similar to any model hobby, model cars, warplanes, rockets, etc.   Then second, the chance to drive either a car you can't ever afford, or possibly a car you could never have access to.   In the case of this specific car, you can have a chance to be Sonny Crockett chasing bad guys through Miami.  I'd bet any guy who is child of the 80's would easily recognize the Daytona. However, what many might not know is the car we all fell in love with was NOT a Ferrari. Not a real one at first.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cars_in_Miami_Vice  So maybe it all depends on your goal. Some to collect, some to experience, some to imitate. Whatever your goal, it's still just about loving cars."

Ferrari,1znmlt,SeedlessJack,7,Wed Mar 5 20:35:09 2014 UTC,Wax degrades extremely fast at temperatures much lower than the operating temperature of your brakes. To do what you are trying here would require a sealant - at least if you want it to last longer than a trip around the block :)
Ferrari,1znmlt,mystikos,1 point,Wed Mar 5 21:42:29 2014 UTC,I want some more advice on this! I work at an exotic custom shop and I there is anyway to preserve that gloss I am more than interested
Ferrari,1znmlt,mystikos,2,Thu Mar 6 01:49:13 2014 UTC,I am not sure there is anything designed specifically for this but I can say I have had fantastic results on my Ferrari with CQuartz Finest (http://www.cquartz.com/finest). It covers the entire car as well as the calipers and has held up well.   I've not tried it but I suspect you would get good results from JetSeal 109 Sealant from The Chemical Guys (http://www.chemicalguys.com/Chemical_Guys_WAC_118_16_JetSeal_109_16_oz_p/wac_118_16.htm).  Good Luck :)

Keep in mind that 360 is going to still be a greater dollar per mile, that is after the car has been paid off, the insurance and the gas.  It usually runs around .80-1.00 a mile just due to maintenance and general upkeep.  The price for the car, whichever you choose, will just be an entry price point into the car."
Ferrari,1ynbcj,Rackbaw,1 point,Mon Feb 24 20:13:53 2014 UTC,"That's not a bad price for the shape and mileage. I've had the pleasure to drive a 308 for a week. You couldn't wipe a grin off my face. It's a timeless style, and everything about the car, the sounds, the sights and the smells, scream classic ferrari. There is no doubt in my mind that you won't enjoy the hell out of that car."
Ferrari,1ynbcj,tifosiv122,4,Mon Feb 24 20:36:25 2014 UTC,"I've had two - they are fantastic cars. I do like the look of the 308 better (seriously who doesn't?) but if you need the extra room or want a drop top, they are a ton of fun. Mechanically they aren't all that different from 308/328/348 depending on what mondial you are taking about. They share a lot of the same parts.  The later year t's have more power but I opted for the 3.2s because I like the look better (larger side flares) and I didn't want power steering. They aren't viper fast, but they aren't Prius slow either. If you push them you will have a blast - anyone who says otherwise has never really driven one. Dont expect them to raise in value anytime soon. Buy it to drive it. You can find a similar price 308 so if price is your only concern the mondial shouldn't be the only model to choose from."
Ferrari,1ynbcj,Anofir,3,Sun Feb 23 01:38:38 2014 UTC,"I heard the Mondial didn't handle very well and is also quite slow, as well as having mechanical issues. I think probably all Ferrari's have mechanical issues at some point, unless very well maintained."

Ferrari,1ynbcj,yourbrotherrex,1 point,Sun Feb 23 01:49:51 2014 UTC,"If you have the patience, you can find a genuine f355 close to 30k: much more Ferrari satisfaction for your $."
Ferrari,1ynbcj,tifosiv122,2,Sun Feb 23 17:17:13 2014 UTC,A lot of money will need to go into a $30k 355...that is the one model I would not go cheap on.
Ferrari,1ynbcj,whoapower,2,Mon Feb 24 03:50:36 2014 UTC,"Agreed.  A 30K 355 will be a trainwreck and need another 20-30 to be just decently right.  With leaking header issues, valve guide issues (which can still crop up), even more electrical gremlins than a 348, you just don't know what you are buying in a 30K 355.  As for the OP, if you want a Ferrari, get one.  Don't settle for what might not make you happy.  If you think a Mondial will make you happy, great!  Go for it!  Just don't look for a ""deal"" on a car.  Get the right one and get a proper PPI (pre purchase inspection).  It will be worth it, even if the flaws and issues are pointed out.  But if the Mondial will not make you happy, and if you are buying it just because it has a horse on the hood, keep saving up or find means to obtain the car you want.  Banks and credit unions will certainly lend you money on something like this.  Insurance isn't as bad as you might think - as long as you have a garage to store it in.  If you are seriously interested, just go to your financial institution and start asking if you want to borrow.  Interest rates are so low these days, it doesn't make sense to shell out cash, which could be needed for other investments or in dire emergencies.  Other cars to consider:  308, 328 (later ones becoming more expensive), 348's and 456's - which can be found sub 50K and are quite subtle in design."
Ferrari,1ynbcj,yourbrotherrex,1 point,Mon Feb 24 04:39:25 2014 UTC,"That's what I meant by patience. There's always someone our there who bought too much car than they could afford; it's guys like that where they're cash poor and just need to unload the vehicle at a greatly reduced price.

Ferrari,1y4w1d,leksanski,2,Mon Feb 17 09:49:57 2014 UTC,That's cool. I will never understand the fascination with this car. I know I'm in the minority but I find it ugly.
Ferrari,1xppa2,tellman1257,5,Wed Feb 12 15:35:23 2014 UTC,looks fantastic.
Ferrari,1xppa2,Robinoo,2,Wed Feb 12 16:31:42 2014 UTC,"Not a fan. The original California (meaning the original modern version) looked better in my opinion. I liked the headlights - tail pipes, and hood. The 'update' with the silver side inserts looked awful, so in that regard this is better. If the first one came in 6-speed, it would have been the perfect car for me. :(  {yes, I'm aware 2 or 3 were special ordered in stick}"

Ferrari,1xppa2,TheDhan,1 point,Thu Feb 13 04:52:50 2014 UTC,As far as I know it was not an official option but a special order. There are plenty of people including myself that tried to order one at the dealer and was told it was not available.
Ferrari,1xppa2,tifosiv122,0,Thu Feb 13 14:25:01 2014 UTC,Really you tried to order one? What were you told? I've always been curious about those 2 manual Calis.
Ferrari,1xppa2,tifosiv122,1 point,Sun Feb 23 15:30:15 2014 UTC,"I went to order a Cali twice - two different dealerships. Both times I was outright told it was not possible to get it in stick. At the time I had 3 Ferrari's that I was going to trade in + cash for the Cali. When I did find out (years later) that there were a few in stick I went back to the salesman who worked with me. He claimed it must have been a special order because it was not on their options list. Additionally, this could be for high end customers (ie the ones who get chosen for the special models, laFerrari)."
Ferrari,1xppa2,Ferrarisimo,0,Mon Feb 24 03:48:27 2014 UTC,"Interesting. A few different sites reported that there was only a handful cause only a few people ordered them, which I found hard to believe. I imagine they'll be worth a decent sum someday."

Ferrari,1xo7ug,tifosiv122,9,Wed Feb 12 02:34:15 2014 UTC,"Let me provide some background. I purchased this one ~4/2011 on eBay for $16,000. I paid $1,500 to transport her to me. The 'seller' knew very little about the car. It was a huge gamble, but I've always wanted a red/tan 348 and people were asking crazy money for them and they all needed work. I figured, how bad could she be.  She arrives and she is very rough. Terrible paint, crack in the front spoiler, crack in the side door - but damn, she's still sexy! I committed to driving her until something major went wrong before I let my mechanic tear her apart.   The clutch was weak from when she arrived. I had some great runs with her - put on about 800 miles before I lost the clutch completely. At first it was just first gear - tried to get home - then lost second, third, and fourth. Eventually had to be towed.  Mechanic took her apart. Besides the obvious clutch there was a ton of work that needed to be done. Mechanic had her from 9/2011 - 10/2012.   It turns out that the other major issues, besides a ton of oil leaks...the valve spring broke damaging the bucket, valve, and cylinder head.  Needless to say a lot of work needed to be done.   The attached 300+ pictures shows you what was done. I had the opportunity to replace some broken parts with new (real) carbon fiber. This upped the price of the job considerably, but even if I went OEM it would have still cost a fortune.  I was able to drive her before we decided to give her a complete overhaul. She is now awaiting full paint & all new leather / carpet. She will now be as pretty outside and she is mechanically. I setup another set of pics for the inside/outside when it's finished.   Feel free to ask any questions."
Ferrari,1xo7ug,amishchicken,4,Wed Feb 12 02:42:41 2014 UTC,I love a well documented restoration job. Looks amazing! How is the cost of the rebuild vs buying a minty one? Im looking at doing the same thing but ebay searches for parts have me worried...
Ferrari,1xo7ug,karnac,1 point,Wed Feb 12 04:01:32 2014 UTC,In this case I'm extremely upside down. There is no way I could sell her (not that I want to) for what I'm into it.   A 'minty' one - it's still going to have issues. The cars are 20+ years old.
Ferrari,1xo7ug,Qexodus,1 point,Wed Feb 12 21:18:14 2014 UTC,"This is some good shit. I enjoy watching build pic's. Thank you for this! Also Only question I have, and I hope it is not out of line, but what was the total price to do what you have done, and what do you estimate the total price for the paint and interior to be? No need to answer if you don't want to.  Thanks."
Ferrari,1xo7ug,Qexodus,1 point,Tue Mar 11 20:59:45 2014 UTC,Thank you. Estimate for paint & interior is ~$20k. The mechanicals were a lot more. I've been well upside down on this vehicle since we decided to go forward. By the time I'm done this would be around $80-90k worth of car - one that I could sell for maybe $25k?
Ferrari,1xo7ug,InvertedBladeScrape,2,Tue Mar 18 21:31:02 2014 UTC,Very cool.
Ferrari,1xo7ug,Heer_,2,Wed Feb 12 03:44:29 2014 UTC,"That is awesome. I really like these, not quite as much as the 355 though.   Beautiful restoration - post more when you redo the interior like you mentioned!"
Ferrari,1xo7ug,MarsterNelle4,2,Wed Feb 12 05:23:58 2014 UTC,I had a 355 as well - two very different cars. I actually prefer the look of the 348 over the 355 and I also like the way it drives better. Rougher - sort of speak. It feels like a big go cart. The 355 is a hell of a car though.

Ferrari,1xhtwx,trepanman,3,Mon Feb 10 15:06:30 2014 UTC,Any tips on buying a used Ferrari?
Ferrari,1xhtwx,empw,5,Mon Feb 10 13:51:51 2014 UTC,"This is my fifth Ferrari in 5 years...  DON'T buy one if you can just afford the purchase price. Don't buy one with a ""fresh major"" - while doing these major services ($5-10k) the mechanic ALWAYS finds things that are wrong that should be repaired while the engine is out. However, if you are servicing the car just to sell it, you would tell the mechanic to ignore it. That will bite you (new owner) later on. Buy one without the service and factor that into the price."
Ferrari,1xhtwx,empw,3,Mon Feb 10 15:09:36 2014 UTC,"The newer the car, the lower ownership costs. Its pretty much at 360 they began to be reasonable when it comes to price to run it through Service. 430 even better, 458 -really OK. Many just buy an old 348, or 355 -but the ownership costs outdo the purchase price within a couple of years."
Ferrari,1xhtwx,empw,1 point,Mon Feb 10 14:24:16 2014 UTC,I'm 25 now but I would love to own a Ferrari in my lifetime. I love the 360 so this is good news. Maybe by the time I'm 40 I'll be able to afford one.
Ferrari,1xhtwx,empw,3,Mon Feb 10 14:31:42 2014 UTC,I got my first at 29. 2 more at 30 - I'm 33 now. There were points in which I never thought I would be able to buy one - the economy tank in 2008 really helped me as I did have some extra cash to spend and prices were still low in 2009 when I bought my first.

Yes, the dude can do whatever the fuck he wants to the car, because he has the money to buy it and it is his.  However, when you do shit like this to draw attention to yourself, expect the people, whose attention you got, to form an opinion about it.

An argument that is about useless as this one, since you can't force people to not develop an opinion about something that was designed to draw their attention in the first place.

Ferrari,1w6y92,redditor1983,5,Sun Jan 26 21:53:19 2014 UTC,I've seen about 5 or 6 Ferraris total in my area since I started paying attention to cars (about 6 or 7 years ago).  I see Gallardos and Mercedes SLSs much more often.  EDIT: I should add that the majority of Ferraris I've seen have been 10 years old or even older. I've only seen one current model Ferrari (a 458) and I only saw it once.
Ferrari,1w6y92,redditor1983,2,Sun Jan 26 16:53:41 2014 UTC,"I should have mentioned as well there isn't a shortage of lambos, mercedes, audi r8, and astons but it seems Ferraris are the super car of choice. As for seeing new Ferraris, within about a year or two of a new one being released it will become the common one here. The ferrari and maserati dealership is close to where I live and every year they have a charity event for a children's hospital,  last time I went there were about 50 Ferraris and 35 maseratis.  Edit: Although older ones also seem to be spotted from time to time as well."

Ferrari,1w6y92,BurberryTrench,1 point,Tue Jan 28 02:10:19 2014 UTC,"yeah it was used. I bought it about 3 years ago when i was 27. I looked for a little higher mileage one with a great service history. I would rather have a little higher mileage than lower because they are meant to be driven and the more hey are driven the more the ""issues"" are sorted out. As fa as major it needs to be done every 5 ish years and it is kind of expensive, but as far as doing the normal service intervals means the cars will last."

Ferrari,1tl2tj,Bruck,1 point,Sat Dec 28 14:23:51 2013 UTC,"Most people don't realize it's a replica. Most people don't know what to think, maybe because they've never seen older Ferraris, I guess. They'll usually ask ""what year is that car?"", and I usually say something like ""well, the car it's been modded to look like is a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO, but there's no way I could afford one of those, so this was built using a 78 Datsun 280Z."" They're always very nice, usually saying something like, ""man, that's one good-looking old-school car, no matter what"". I'll usually point out the major body differences between an original and mine if they're interested (like the length of the hood, and the hatchback), and if they ask me how much it cost me, I usually say ""about 40 million dollars cheaper than a real one.""

But the F12 just seems a pleasure to drive, everyone I see driving a F12 goes nuts and after a curve they scream of joy. It must feel like a very very very nasty beast and you are able to drive it(or try to drive it xD).   Every review that I saw about the F12 states that you need to be "" a pro driver or a really crazy guy"" to drive the F12 with everything off(traction control, Manual, etc). A guy from EVO.co.uk said ""You need to have the hands of a surgeon and the feet of a ballet dancer to be able to really push it"". And that is what I think its funny about the F12, trying to tame it must be one hell of a ride!   I just wish someday I can drive my own F12, or anyone's F12! xD  Forza Ferrari!"

Ferrari,1sx4li,F_d_ANCONIA,8,Sun Dec 15 06:33:08 2013 UTC,"Your compadre sounds like a BMW owner talking about a Mercedes owner.   Let me put it this way, if you own a Ferrari, this is the response you would have if someone was buying a BMW. Ferraris DRIVE LIKE GOD. WHO CARES IF IT IS PINK."
Ferrari,1sx4li,Elite_Deforce,5,Sun Dec 15 08:16:06 2013 UTC,"First things first. If you ever order a Ferrari in pink, Ferrari reserves the right to deliver a pink Morris Marina in its place at full cost because you don't actually deserve said Ferrari.   Second, and this is an answer to OP's question, a Ferrari becomes more than a status car when you can actually drive it. If you own a Ferrari because you're rich but can't take it around the track because you're retarded, its a status car. If you buy a Ferrari because your rich and can put in a respectable lap time, then its more than a status car."
Ferrari,1sx4li,goochBuster,6,Sun Dec 15 08:46:28 2013 UTC,"To add to the pink Ferrari debacle, the only reason a person should ever buy a Ferrari in any other color than red is if they already have that model in red."

Ferrari,1sx4li,b20vteg,4,Fri Dec 20 17:43:26 2013 UTC,"I used to have a similar mentality.  I could build a car that would do well or beat a stock ferrari, so why bother buying one? Then I saw an Enzo at Wynn Las Vegas and it changed my thought process..  The Enzo had every detail taken care of in terms of going fast. It was already built of carbon fiber. It already had huge carbon ceramic brakes. It already had sorted aero, magnetically adjustable pushrod suspension, an evil sounding v-12, full engine management, very advanced traction control, dynamic suspension control and rediculously wide tires. It hit me that a Ferrari already has every single detail I would want in a fast car, for a when-new price that probably turns out to be pretty damn reasonable and much less drama than me building something from a lesser chassis. Then there is the racing pedigree. These cars are only built by Ferrari to fund their racing program, for the most part, which is the coolest reason I can think of to be in the car business.  Going down the Ferrari line a few notches, a 458 or 430 or 360 all retain many of the qualities of the Enzo, and are at a much lower price point.   And.. last.. they almost all have design elements that are not found in another vehicle. People who know Nothing about cars recognize a Ferrari as a fast car and something out of the ordinary."

Ferrari,1ogu2v,BurberryTrench,9,Tue Oct 15 00:43:34 2013 UTC,"First, read the owners manuals. They cover all the bases and you will learn a lot.  Second, Ferrari Chat (http://www.ferrarichat.com) is your friend. You will find tons of useful information and people who can help.  Next, to get you started here are a few basics. Always keep the car on a trickle charger. Ferrari actually supplies one but you are better off with a newer version. Most people place a lead in back of the drivers seat on the main bus. See (http://aldousvoice.com/2012/08/12/ferrari-360-fitting-a-battery-tender-and-improving-the-range-of-the-remote-control-fob/) Low battery can cause the car to behave very oddly and can damage the ECU/TCU. Note: the car never really powers down all the way and may drain a full battery inside a few weeks.  Starting the car takes a little time. If you haven't done so in the last 90 seconds (I think) hit the alarm button and wait for the red triangle to disappear and then turn the key to the on position - wait for the ""check ok"" to go away and start the car. Now go get coffee while it's warming up...  The manual will inform you not to take the engine over 4000 RPM until BOTH the engine temperature and the oil temp are warm - heed this warning.   Lastly, if you need an extra key or FOB do NOT ask Ferrari for it. There are people on Ferrari Chat who can make you one. I can do this as well if you like.   Good Luck, and congrats you will fall in love with it quickly...  P.S. When possible after driving it open the bonnet and let the engine cool for a little while. It will place less stress on the softer parts."
Ferrari,1ogu2v,mystikos,2,Tue Oct 15 05:27:40 2013 UTC,"Thanks so much for the info & detailed response. I also posted a few pics as proof (or at least very good evidence) in reply to another comment if you're interested. I will check out the charger and other links. Also, could you watch this - the part you need to watch is only 10 secs. The driver is paying to drive it and has the instructor. At about 3:15, the driver shifts and the instructor commends his shift as being smooth and with his foot ""just hovering."" What does that mean? Is there a proper way to shift/what to do with the gas so I don't go clunking into the next gear? I mean I know obviously what rpm to do it at, etc, but how do I make sure I don't get that ""bump?""  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KtzqF2mPUU"
Ferrari,1ogu2v,mystikos,2,Tue Oct 15 07:16:00 2013 UTC,Don't let off the throttle when requesting an up-shift. That will confuse the computer as to your intentions. You can ease off a little but not a lot. You'll find the sweet spot with a little practice.  A couple things to remember. You (F1) clutch does not last long. Try to limit the time you spend in reverse. Keeping the car in sport mode helps save the clutch. At low speeds (like in stop and go traffic) treat the throttle like it's a on or off sort of thing. This produces a kind of hopping forward you will see others do. I don't mean make it too jerky but you want the computer to fully engage or disengage the clutch and spend little time in-between. Oh there is new software for your TCU. Make sure it's been re-flashed and have them index the clutch to see what your percent left is and to make adjustments.
Ferrari,1ogu2v,mystikos,1 point,Tue Oct 15 17:37:27 2013 UTC,"At low speeds (like in stop and go traffic) treat the throttle like it's a on or off sort of thing. This produces a kind of hopping forward you will see others do. I don't mean make it too jerky but you want the computer to fully engage or disengage the clutch and spend little time in-between.   Can you explain that a little better/detailed? It seems important. Well, not better, I'm sure you explained it well, but I'm not the smartest and want to make sure I understand. I don't think I deserve this car so I damn well don't want to abuse it.  Also, If I put 100-150 miles on it a week, is that going overboard? Will it hurt it in any way? I assume the only downside it that it would require more regular maintenance? I'm not trying to sound like an ass but paying for the maintenance isn't really a problem. Should I keep it only as a weekend car? I have an Acura that I drive now, and obviously, am keeping both. Of course I'm not driving this 360 in rain or snow etc!"
Ferrari,1ogu2v,mystikos,2,Tue Oct 15 21:28:09 2013 UTC,"ok, I'll see if I can explain it better. Basically, you want the computer to engage (and disengage) the clutch quickly. When taking off if you are on the gas a little heavy the clutch will engage quickly. You may then completely let off the gas and coast a bit. So your speed ramps up quickly and you coast and bleed off speed. It looks a little like someone first learning to drive a stick shift as it is a little abrupt. What you want to avoid is making the computer feather the clutch constantly. So you don't want to creep along at say 3 mph for a while - better to hit 8 mph  and off the throttle and coast. Your clutch will be happier. I'm not saying you need to jerk it around it just takes a little to get the balance down.  You won't hurt it either way it will just save you some clutch life. So don't worry too much about it. The 360 is perfectly capable of being a daily driver and you can put as many miles on it as you like as long as you keep up the maintenance. If you don't let it sit for long periods of time and drive it for at least 30 minutes when you do it will be less troublesome. I try not to let mine sit for more than 3 weeks for example. Sometimes in what we call winter here that happens but that's not to big a deal because the rest of the year I have driven it regularly."
Ferrari,1ogu2v,reddit4sissies,1 point,Wed Oct 16 04:56:18 2013 UTC,"Alright, I think I got it. Don't creep along slowly in stop and go traffic. Instead let the traffic advance a little so I can get a bit higher of speed faster, and then make up the distance to the car infront of me by coasting.   One last question that I'm dying to know. Should I/is it beneficial to put the car into neutral when I'm at a redlight or stopped for a prolonged amount of time? I've read, for all cars in general, that this relieves some stress on the transmission...  Thanks, you've been really helpful. I appreciate it."
Ferrari,1ogu2v,qs0,1 point,Wed Oct 16 05:54:30 2013 UTC,"Correct... Typically if you will be sitting for a while you should put it into neutral. If you have just missed a light and it's a long one I would. Otherwise, it's fine to keep it in gear for a short periods of time."
Ferrari,1ogu2v,mystikos,1 point,Wed Oct 16 16:02:19 2013 UTC,"Okay, so I've driven it a bit.  When I do normal acceleration I change gear at 3.5-4k rpm. If I want to give it more gas, but not go near redline, do you know where I should aim to shift? 6k? Redline starts at 8.5k.  Also, when I shift, there is a sort of silence, and then a bit of a jolt (Don't know how else to describe it) and it then catches the next gear. Is that normal or should I be getting smoother shifts? I just worry it's banging violently into the next gear or something.  Let me try to recreate sound with text.  vvvvvVVVVVVVROOOOOM ......................VVVVVVRRRRROOOOOOOM  Haha, sorry, but I think I got my point there.  Lastly, in traffic, I move in first gear, sometimes I get into second. In these gears, if I'm moving and then let off the gas, the car kind of jolts/jerks. Is that normal/bad? If it's bad, how do I prevent it? You know lots about cars I assume, but this same thing happened in a 370z I was driving.  Sorry for all these questions..."

Ferrari,1ogu2v,mystikos,2,Fri Oct 25 00:29:47 2013 UTC,Question: I've taken my RPMs over 4000 in my car (Mercedes c63 AMG) while the engine and oil were cold. Can doing that only a couple times damage the car?
Ferrari,1ogu2v,qs0,3,Tue Oct 15 17:25:55 2013 UTC,You are fine but you might not want to make a practice of it. The Merc engine is less sensitive than the Ferrari. The Ferrari's 3.6 liter (NA) makes 400-420 hp so that's ~117 hp / liter - it's wound a little tighter than most. Check your owners manual it might give some guidelines; German's love guidelines.
Ferrari,1ogu2v,qs0,2,Tue Oct 15 17:47:02 2013 UTC,"Non-owner enthusiast with lots of time on Fchat here.  This is great advice. Listen to this guy, he knows what's up. :)  Also, 360s are starting to seriously show their age (no offense meant), the bills WILL be expensive.  DO NOT put off a belt service if yours is due (theres both a calender and km limit on them).  These cars get better and better the more you drive and maintain them, don't let her become a garage queen. Seriously consider whether you are prepared for the financial and time commitment an aging Fcar demands, 10k a year is not unheard of.    Good luck with the car!  Drive her in good health!  :D"
Ferrari,1ogu2v,Fidget11,1 point,Tue Oct 15 17:48:38 2013 UTC,"Thanks and you bring up an important point that I forgot. The maintenance schedules have both time and mileage intervals. The maintenance will be required no matter if you drive it or not. Let that sink in for a minute.... Ok, the belt service is very important and you will need to do it MORE often IF you do not drive the car. The car will be happier if you drive her every few weeks. So BMGfan also knows what he is talking about :)"

Ferrari,1kgl1d,cherydad33,6,Thu Aug 22 00:42:49 2013 UTC,"Depends on how much you're gonna drive and how hard.  And what your budget is.  The problem with the Mondial is that almost any amount of service that the car will need will cost more than the car is worth.  If you need a major, you might as well throw it away and buy another one.  360s are pretty inexpensive and, as among the first ""mass produced"" of the V8s, I think they'd make an excellent starter Ferrari.  You can do the major engine service without having to remove the motor.  I've never owned a 360 -- not a fan of the design.  But I know lots of guys (and one woman) that have/had them and I can't think of anyone that regrets their time with the 360.  If you can find a decent grey market 360 in the states, go that route.  You'll save a nickel and they're (in my experience) faster than the US-spec 360s  For what it's worth, my first Ferrari was an F355.  Spent $85,000 on it, I think.  Previous owner drove it sparingly.  I did not.  In the first 1,500 miles that I drove it, I had to rebuild/remount the alternator.  Was about $1,200 if I recall correctly.  I had to do 2 engine out services to the tune of about $4k or $5k a pop.  Chose the non-dealer route the first time to save a nickel and it didn't run right until the second service that the dealer did about 2 years later.  De-rubbered the interior switches, reconditioned the seats, etc.  Lots of little things.  One day, I went to start her up and she wouldn't crank.  None of the normal ""fixes"" got her running, so the dealer came with a tow.  ECU was dead.  Estimated $7k and 4 months.  Turns out, the ECU was replaced by the previous owner under warranty -- so they warrantied that ECU however many years later when it died again.  All in all, I probably spent about 1/3 to 1/5 the price I paid for the car to keep it running.  And I loved every minute of it!  Also, in the ""for what it's worth"" category, the latest Ferrari I got has maintenance included for, I think 7 years."

Ferrari,1jtayf,Toast_One_Seven,2,Wed Aug 7 00:32:21 2013 UTC,I don't know the law in Pennsylvania but in MD a license plate in the window is still ticketable.  I did a lot of research on this when I had a Lotus.  Fortunately Lotus had a federal waiver to not require a front license plate because the Elise/Exige design didn't have front bumper space for one.  I believe that's expired now.
Ferrari,1jtayf,Toast_One_Seven,1 point,Wed Aug 7 01:47:50 2013 UTC,"The front bumper on the elise is quite barren.  I've seen a few that have a really low mounted plate bracket.  In PA so we don't have front license plates.  It looks like it would greatly reduce air going through to the radiator/cause cooling issues.

Ferrari,1ihs31,empw,5,Wed Jul 17 16:17:43 2013 UTC,"It is about equal on the older/newer arguement. Simply because the 308 is older, and the 355 has a ton of hydraulics (the F1 transmission, for instance). the cheapest to own is sadly a Mondial Quattrovalvole, because you don't need to drop the engine for services. my personal choice on a budget is the 348, as they aren't as hydraulically and electonically operated as the 355, and they are a lot newer than a 308i"
Ferrari,1ihs31,bullet50000,3,Wed Jul 17 19:29:53 2013 UTC,"A 308 or 328 will be the cheapest to maintain.  (I'm biased towards my 328, naturally). 355s have a bad reputation for reliability and maintenance costs.  A well-sorted 3x8 can still be had for ""regular people money"", and if you are reasonably comfortable with tools, you can do a surprising amount of work yourself.

In the end it is a Ferrrari, so for a rule of thumb, half of the cars cost is a little extreme, but be realistic and know the probably costs you could get into.  Read, ""One Year with a Ferrari"" for a 355, just google it. And join Ferrarichat.com.  Very useful."
Ferrari,1ihs31,airblizzard,2,Wed Nov 13 16:31:18 2013 UTC,"A good rule of thumb I heard somewhere was budget half of the car's cost for repairs every year.

It's not because they are uncomfortable or have poor storage or anything like that. It's because you can't feel comfortable leaving it most places where the general public, who have no respect for the property of others, will have access to it. For example, a movie theater. People will see you get out of it, and they KNOW you won't be back for a couple of hours. Inevitably, someone will let envy get the better of them. The Porsche is a better choice in this regard.

I will however leave the Porsche places; here in Austin Porsches are (almost) under the radar. The Ferrari always draws a crowd and they get damaged that way. People don't normally mean to but it just happens.  So, my suggestion, buy the Ferrari - it's simply amazing; also buy an older 911 (maybe not a 964 but SC, 993 or even a 996) and drive that every day. You will have the best of all worlds - I promise."
Ferrari,1ie4q1,mystikos,3,Tue Jul 16 05:36:29 2013 UTC,"Do, or have you ever owned a 360?"
Ferrari,1ie4q1,SillyPuppy,4,Tue Jul 16 05:56:18 2013 UTC,"I've got an F355 Spider. Adore it, despite the maintenance costs, drive it like I stole it... Except around town for normal stuff. ;-)   Considered a 360 a few times, but next time around, I'm getting something just as capable but a little more usable day-to-day... Test drove the F-Type this weekend and I think I'm headed that way, eventually."
Ferrari,1ie4q1,SillyPuppy,2,Tue Jul 16 06:16:12 2013 UTC,"I thought about the 355 but I saw the prices were not far off the 360's and the 360 seems to have a better reputation for reliability/costs.   I had been considering a Maserati Granturismo, but I just can't seem to justify it over a Ferrari. The Porsche is appealing on other levels because I have been a Porsche fan since I was a kid and a family friend (who raced 911's) gave me a toy 959."
Ferrari,1ie4q1,SillyPuppy,1 point,Tue Jul 16 06:42:27 2013 UTC,"If you're going to get a Ferrari, don't get anything earlier than a 360. Starting with the 360, reliability has gotten much better. Mine has been pretty good the last few years, but having a good mechanic is KEY.  At one point, I didn't have a good mechanic, and I got very frustrated with the car. I considered trading for something else, and the Maserati GranSport Spyder looked like a good fit for us. Checked every box except one - it wasn't at all exciting to drive (it felt pretty much like my E46 M3 that I had at the time). The GranTurismo should be MUCH better - I've heard nothing but good reviews. And it's sedate-looking enough to not draw that much attention when you're not in your car's line-of-sight.  I, personally, don't get excited over Porsches (with the exception of the Carrera GT), but if you love them, and I know plenty of guys who swear by them, and wouldn't part with them for all the world. Reliability is VERY high, they're wonderfully quick and fast, and offer enough comforts and conveniences that they make for wonderful all-around cars. They handle track work, too, without batting an eyelash."
Ferrari,1ie4q1,Fox-donut,1 point,Tue Jul 16 14:46:46 2013 UTC,"I like Porsches, I'm a big BMW guy, and I have an X6 that my SO will likely end up driving. The Porsche has always been a bit of a dream for me. But then I saw a Ferrari which I had thought was just too expensive to ever be an option and realized in fact it isn't.   It's hard when there are two cars from two brands that are effectively both dream cars for you and you can select just one."
Ferrari,1ie4q1,jowww87,1 point,Tue Jul 16 15:14:19 2013 UTC,"You can always get one, and in a few years, switch it for the other if you want to be able to say you've owned both... The 360 doesn't have much further depreciation left on it - it'll be worth a good percentage of what you paid for it in 5 years, while the water-cooled Porsches (997, 991) will drop more heavily in that time frame. If resale is a concern of yours, keep that in mind, too."
Ferrari,1ie4q1,Surok86,1 point,Tue Jul 16 16:56:39 2013 UTC,"This reminds me of a clip on Topgear - 360 vs 997  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO7XvOt9suM  Actually Clarksons review is probably a good summary of why you want a Porsche and not a Ferrari as a daily driver.  Edit - depending where you live in the world, a 456 might be an alternative to a 360 - I;m told - very easy to live with as well."

Im on a tour of northeast italy and the head leader of our small group knows some guys.. Some big guys... Like beretta firearms factory, 10 feet away from runway watching frecce tri colori and it goes on.. But yes it was amazing everyone is all happy and all decked out in ferrari pit crew gear. There is a peace garden right smack in the middle of the factory. But yes words cant descride the atmosphere of it."

Ferrari,1i6phy,bullet50000,4,Fri Jul 12 23:35:52 2013 UTC,"Ok so first of all, you have to be a ferrari owner to get into the factory. Unless you know people. But as far as the factory goes... You walk in, get a factory passport. The reason for the passport is now you can go back anytime you want free of charge. Next you go into the factory and see some of the different production lines. Very calm and relaxed workers because the ferrari family pays for basicly there whole lives. Children, residence ext. but there all in there ferarri suits walking around or at there stations working on whatever the job is. If its rims, body, engine ext. its all very modern on the inside and very authentic looking from the outside. But most of the lines are robots with just tech guys watching over whats going on. Anything else you want to know just ask.!"

Ferrari,1d5jlv,BMCBoid,6,Fri Apr 26 14:04:13 2013 UTC,"I love the 308's. They are wonderful -- BUT -- you need to be prepared for the maintenance. In spite of what it may look like there is NO inexpensive Ferrari!  First, having been sitting this will need some new seals and belts. In this generation that means pulling the engine. You will have to do this every 3 years anyway. It can cost $12000 a pop sometimes a little less sometimes a little more. The general rule for Ferrari's is budget $1 for every mile. So I would be ready for an initial $15000 - $18000 in maintenance up front since it has been sitting. If you are ok with paying the up front costs and almost that much every few years ok.   I would, personally, never buy a Ferrari  that did not have all records and been cared for lovingly. The potential for badness is just too high and it's better to pay up front. In my opinion you will pay less up front if you buy a 30-40k 308 in good condition.     Ok, that said, it can be a life changing event and should be fantastic. Yeah, I know that sounds stupid but it is true. When I was looking to buy my first Porsche someone told me to do it because it would change my life - it did - a lot. The same was true with my first Ferrari. If you can swing it get one and JOIN the Ferrari club of America. You will meet great people and do some amazing things. (Note the same is true for the Porsche Club)   Edit: Added more encouraging stuff at the end."

While at some point, it does make sense to pull the engine, it is absolutely not necessary to do so for a belt / valve job on a 3x8.  The engine is transverse in these cars, all you gotta do is pop off a wheel and you're looking right at the belts.  Don't be scared by these older cars, they're the easiest to maintain, even as a DIY mechanic."

What you are actually seeing is a 458 decked out in wrap for a charity called the Blue Planet Network which works on providing safe drinking water around the world (http://blueplanetnetwork.org/about/)  The car was/is wrapped like that because the owner was promoting the charity through a fundraising rally of the Ferrari Owner's Group where they raised $120k.  See the car in the 12th picture here: http://fogrally.com/media/2012-1 And in the 5th picture here: http://fogrally.com/media/2012-2/

Ferrari,19pa6i,kloetersound,3,Tue Mar 5 19:14:59 2013 UTC,I am actually in love with this car. It's so beautiful.
Ferrari,19pa6i,Strobepomf,7,Wed Mar 6 08:29:08 2013 UTC,"I'm very disappointed by the design. Sure, it is a technical tour-de-force, but there is not one single thing I can see here that makes me love this car like I love the 288 GTO or the F40.  I see so many features all over the place on the exterior, the car doesn't appear to have any discernible shape or presence. Older Ferraris seemed to look 'together' where this looks like a bunch of different smaller sections connected to each other. The front looks technical and modern, while the curves over the rear hips seem at odds with the front. There is far too much messy news going on at the back. I know it's all in aid of performance, handling, economy, aerodynamics, etc, but this, and the FF and F12, were where I officially stopped loving Ferrari as a modern car company and I'll just pretend they stopped making cars after 2010.  Even though I'll never be able to afford one, I'm still quite upset by this design!"
Ferrari,19pa6i,stdl0g,3,Fri Mar 15 01:14:30 2013 UTC,"I agree with you in that this doesn't have the simplistic design that gives it the ""presence"" of cars like the Enzo, but I feel they went berzerk on the exterior in order to give it equally insane performance (keep in mind it's 3 seconds faster than the F12, Ferrari's fastest road car up to now), and I'm willing to forgive the somewhat cluttered design in the name of speed. Also, I think many of Ferrari's renders seem to exentuate the details, which may make it seem more cluttered than in person.  I felt the same way about the F12 for a while, but the design eventually grew on me and it's now one of my favorite Ferrari's, we'll see how well LaFerrari fares."
Ferrari,19pa6i,MintyChaos,2,Tue Mar 5 12:47:45 2013 UTC,"I can see your point, however I think a stronger point can be made that the design is essentially an updated Enzo.

My son told him he'd be back some day..."

If we're arguing on the behalf of the 911, Porsche has a certain look they've basically based their entire company on over the course of the last 50 years.  The 911 is their icon and doesn't need much changing in terms of styling because that is a 911, that look.  The size changes because they want the car to handle better, but the styling remains the same.  Everything else?  Yeah, it's pretty lazy on their part."

Check out Ferrarichat.com. There is tons of info on the specific car you are looking for.

Ferrari,usrit,Ferrarisimo,2,Mon Jun 11 13:18:31 2012 UTC,"I would go with the following:   F12 Berlinetta: Ferrari's latest GT car is an instant classic as far as I'm concerned. Drop dead gorgeous with that amazing Enzo-derived V12 engine. I would wait until the HGTC package or GTO-equivalent model is released before putting one in my imaginary garage. 458 Spider Scuderia 16M*: While the Stradale/Scuderia version of the 458 has yet to be unveiled, and the Spider version of that car (aka 16M) is probably 12-18 months further out, the second spot in my nonexistent garage would be reserved for this weekend rocket. It would be used primarily for Sunday canyon carving and (extremely) spirited cruises up and down PCH. 250 GTO: Let me just cut a check for $35 million to pick up one of 39 GTOs ever made."

Ferrari,u7ipp,Ferrarisimo,3,Sun May 27 18:13:46 2012 UTC,I swear it's a V8
Ferrari,u7ipp,911991,2,Mon May 28 00:08:39 2012 UTC,"I believe you're right. The original rumor back in February/March was that this was to be a V12, but after digging around for a bit just now, I can't find any evidence that it isn't a V8. In fact, it appears that Ferrari and Clapton originally wanted this car to have a V12, but federalization hurdles made it a lot easier to keep the original 458's V8 in there instead.  If I could edit the headline to reflect this change, I would. Instead, have an upvote."
Ferrari,u7ipp,911991,2,Mon May 28 01:48:54 2012 UTC,I just wish I wasn't right! a V-12 (from the Enzo as I'm sure every video host documenting this car will mention) would have made this a car I truly envy.  Right now I would be content with a plain old 458 over this!
Ferrari,u60sq,Bruck,2,Sat May 26 15:01:58 2012 UTC,"So let me see if I can help to answer some of your questions.  First of all, there were 36 Series 1 cars built (with either a 3.0 liter V12 or a 4.0 Liter V12 (all of them built on Ferrari's 250 Short Wheel Base chassis, except for 4561SA which was built on a Superamerica chassis.  The had a long wheel base model as well, but no GTOs were built on it) with three additional Series 2 cars built later.  On top of those, a couple of the original Series 1 cars were re-bodied to become series 2 cars.  All cars are different, and have small details that distinguish them from the other cars.  For example, chassis number 3757 (owned by Pink Floyd's Nick Mason) has one door 1cm longer than the other door.  Other things that vary are how many ports are on the side of the front quarter-panel, the shape of the nose, the lights, etc.  They really were all built by hand and are unique cars.  For the front port/hole question, the majority of them have removeable plugs that can be taken out or put in, depending on how much air needs to go into the engine bay.  Ralph Lauren's car in the picture on wikipedia has the plugs in, while you oftentimes see them with the holes open.  Other than that, they are fantastic cars, but are way out of most people's price range.  One recently sold at auction for roughly $20 million.  I believe I've heard Nick Mason say that his is insured for closer to $40 million.  Obviously they are only worth what someone will pay for it, but be ready to bust out the checkbook.  Hope that helps, and anyone else please feel free to correct me if I messed up."
