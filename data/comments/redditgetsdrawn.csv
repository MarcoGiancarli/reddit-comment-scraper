redditgetsdrawn,3dmazd,nesir,122,Fri Jul 17 12:47:04 2015 UTC,Was in a bit of a rush so it's messy but here ya go  http://i.imgur.com/iUZpfPF.jpg
redditgetsdrawn,3dmazd,Vezarez,22,Fri Jul 17 19:53:24 2015 UTC,This is like a clever album cover.
redditgetsdrawn,3dmazd,HeirDelta3141,13,Fri Jul 17 20:34:12 2015 UTC,i hate people like you (not really) who are some of the best draftsman in the world and you call it 'messy.' why are you doing this humble brag? you're fucking awesome. own it. haha
redditgetsdrawn,3dmazd,knurdshogun,20,Fri Jul 17 20:21:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is fair. Just because it's awesome to you, it doesn't mean it's awesome to the artist - everyone has different standards for their work. Acknowledging that a piece isn't as good as your normal work isn't necessarily a humblebrag."
redditgetsdrawn,3dmazd,Destruct-o-Bun,4,Fri Jul 17 20:40:38 2015 UTC,"If we were only around the highest of caliber of artists here, that would be one thing, but we have a wide range of skills and abilities here that make it irrelevant for top knotch draftspeople to be critical of their own work. And while this person is capable of doing much better, it goes without saying that they know what they're doing, regardless of how messy it may appear to them it is not a sloppy piece. It's like someone complaining about being slow when they normally run a 100 meter dash in 10.01 seconds and they ran it in 10.5 seconds. That's fine to say if you're around Olympic athletes... but not around hobbyists and people doing things for fun. but it's all good."
redditgetsdrawn,3dmazd,knurdshogun,5,Fri Jul 17 21:22:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think criticism should ever be irrelevant or discouraged, whether it's coming from yourself or others. If you're looking to improve you should always be your own biggest critic, no matter how good you are or what level you're at. Me being critical of my own work just offers others a platform to chime in with their own opinions, good or bad.   I get where you're coming from, but I wasn't really being critical when I called it 'messy'. It'd be like a musician releasing a track demo and saying ""sorry for it sounding harsh, it hasn't been through mastering yet, but hope you enjoy it anyway""  To put it bluntly, it was more of a courtesy thing. I was basically saying I couldn't be arsed spending the extra hour or so it would have took me to clean up the image, so excuse it seeming a bit rushed if you view it that way."
redditgetsdrawn,3dmazd,Vezarez,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:23:05 2015 UTC,I'm with you. Sometimes I just say fuck it to shadow maps and move onto the next thing. I could do a whole piece in the time it takes me to layer out the shadows.
redditgetsdrawn,3dmazd,Madlutian,6,Sat Jul 18 01:06:31 2015 UTC,"I understand where you are coming from, but I can speak from a musicians point of view, and if you aren't critical about all your work you will improve much less than somebody who is. It takes high standards to yield high results. Generally."
redditgetsdrawn,3dmazd,music_player99,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:05:30 2015 UTC,"There is a study that says that confidence is inversely proportional to competence. IOW... the better you are, the more likely you are to not realize how much better you are than others. I guess cognitive bias has its place. My main point is that you don't have to downplay a ""messy"" sketch when it's better than most people can ever hope to achieve even if they put in the same amount of effort. But yeah, I don't see how you can get high results without high standards."
redditgetsdrawn,3dmazd,knurdshogun,6,Fri Jul 17 22:19:50 2015 UTC,"Not if you're the Goat or even Best in the World. Guys like Kobe, Michael Jordan, Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, Jordan Spaeth, Tiger for a long time all display a ton of outward and inward confidence. That's just sports though, and they're large personalities so they're easy to compare. If you want it in business, just watch an episode of shark tank. Everyone of them is obviously one of the best at what they do and they just reek of confidence."
redditgetsdrawn,3dmazd,call_me_Kote,-1,Fri Jul 17 22:38:30 2015 UTC,"Being critical about yourself is one thing, but you can keep it to yourself. This is just like a really skinny girl is saying ""I'm so fat"". Do you know what I mean?"
redditgetsdrawn,3dmazd,knurdshogun,6,Fri Jul 17 22:11:52 2015 UTC,"Artists here can be critical of themselves if they feel inclined, and most certainly don't have to keep it to themselves. This conversation is bordering on disrespectful toward this artist, so it ends here."
redditgetsdrawn,3dmazd,Madlutian,6,Sat Jul 18 03:06:21 2015 UTC,"In RGD if artists want to do the humble brag, we let them do their thing and don't question it. Also, ""humble brag"" has a bit of a negative connotation, so I'll thank you not to use that term toward artists here in the future."
redditgetsdrawn,3dmazd,Shmoonify,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:05:16 2015 UTC,"I find it interesting that this comment would gain that much attention, and regardless I think it is fascinating to read other people's thoughts on the matter of self-criticism. I'm still confused, but i can be a little dense. Obviously I think the person can draw very well. Sorry if my phraseology was a little messy for your taste."

redditgetsdrawn,3dp7z2,onzuka88,2,Sat Jul 18 10:11:33 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks!  Everything I draw always looks disturbing - the process for that is to get into a series of really abusive relationships but then even it out by finding jobs that are equally abusive and awful.  If that doesn't work - move back in with your parents after ten years of living alone - I can pretty much guarantee that their relentless picking at your anxieties will do the trick.  As far as the literal art making process - I start with a line drawing, which for me is pretty much always blind-ish contour.  Then I take two colors somewhere from the mid-tone and break the drawing down into light side and dark side.  This piece is mostly all collage - the two pink patches on either side of the mouth and the orange patches in the eye sockets are my original two mid-tone colors.  Then I took tracing paper and outlined the various facial planes, cut them out, traced around them on whatever pattern fit the needed value and temperature, then glued them in place.  The final step was to add in the details, which were done in black oil pastel."
