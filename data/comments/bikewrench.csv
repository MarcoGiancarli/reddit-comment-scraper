bikewrench,3e6soi,TheBicyclist,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:59:58 2015 UTC,Yeah I've wanted shorter cranks for a while but I'm prompted to do it now because if I don't tighten the bolts every other ride there's a lot of creakin' down there.

However, from the picture you've posted, it doesn't look excessively worn to me: a bolt interfering with the cog would instantly make the bike unrideable except by freewheeling. Bear in mind that the tooth profiles on the cog are not consistent by design: they have shift ramps to help you get up and out onto the next cog. You may be mistaking these (or the serrations which help bind the lockring) for damage.   From your other comment you say you don't know how well it rides: my advice is to take it for a little ride and see for yourself if shifting feels impaired, or there's unusual drivetrain noise or slipping chain or whatever. A couple of miles at most will reveal any major faults. If it feels good, by all means sell it, and include a new cassette if you feel particularly responsible since they're so cheap."

You can restore much of the strength of the member by filling with substitute material, but the risk is that you'll perpetually end up chasing that crack. You can sleeve it (if you have good continuous contact and load sharing between the sleeve and the parent tube), or you can gouge out the crack entirely and re-build the metal.

A lot of hubs these days are ""8/9/10"", and will take any of the three.  I believe (but don't take my word on it) that all Shimano 10-speed hubs are that way.  Chain Reaction has a number of Shimano and Easton rear wheels in the $85-$110 range.  Add a cassette, and you should be good.  They also have a front and rear set for just over $100.

But to answer the question you've asked: use a dremel with a cutting wheel to cut through the rivets if that's all there is.   Or, failing that, remove the second-to-last cog instead of the largest one. Yeah, it'll probably shift pretty poorly, but is that really a huge concern on this mongrel half-breed you've concocted?  Best of all: use a modern freakin' hub. You're lacing up the better part of $200 worth of rims to extremely outdated hubs that force you to make compromises in other areas. DT350s aren't super expensive, Ultegra 6700/6800 even less so. You probably wouldn't even need to cold set it unless you really wanted to. 2mm per side isn't that extreme."
bikewrench,3e555d,FalseBuddha,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:03:29 2015 UTC,"Why to which bit?   In answer to your answer though. I'm aware a Dremel is going to come into play. But when the last Couple of cogs are riveted onto a spider it doesn't do you any good to take one off. The base of the spider is still the same width, meaning it won't fit onto a seven speed freehub, which is precisely why I'm planning on running it 9-of-10."
bikewrench,3e555d,FalseBuddha,2,Wed Jul 22 02:14:46 2015 UTC,"Just why to all of it. Why put so much money and effort into making an old bike do something it --and the parts you're trying to hack onto it-- was never meant for?  Secondly, by ""second-to-last"" I meant ""second smallest"". It's going to be one of the less frequently used cogs, will shorten the overall width of the cassette, and won't effect the lockring. Also, if you're that dedicated to Frankenstein's monster you could always try shaving down the spider of any 10sp cassette similar to how Shimano has made their 42t 11sp cassettes fit on standard 10sp freehubs; the largest cog actually sits over the hub flange."
bikewrench,3e555d,p34y95p9hfcsd,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:19:19 2015 UTC,"I thought about shaving it down. Many of the MTB cassettes come with a washer riveted on the inside with the largest cog hanging out over the hub flange. I didn't know if that would be enough though. I was hoping someone might have experience with that.   As to why to all of it? Because its fun. Because its more interesting to me than getting excited about the marginal gains on the latest race bike I won't race. Because it is a reasonably light tubing spec on a bike with clearance for wide tires and eyelets for fenders which you can't find on anything new that isn't custom. Because I like the way the bike fits me. Because it has a story. And because bike shop employees get bored of boring new bikes, and like to try fun and interesting things. I know what I'm doing and I know what I'm getting into. What I don't have is every 10 spd Cassette that is Shimano/SRAM compatible in front of me or in my store.

The bike shop told you not to pedal while shifting??? The picture you linked shows a bike with a derailleur.  You must pedal (forwards) while shifting on a bike like that.   Every full crank would result in half the crank not engaging the wheel and just 'slipping'.   Are you able to tell if the problem is that chain is slipping over the teeth on a sprocket?  Or is it that the rear sprocket is spinning fine, but the sprockets aren't ""catching"" and therefore aren't spinning the wheel?"
bikewrench,3e4p8k,tommywalsh666,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:11:58 2015 UTC,"Slipping is certainly a sign of a problem with the gear system and is not normal. If the teeth are considerably worn or chain stretched, that can cause slipping, but on a new bike, something else is wrong. Hard to diagnose without looking at it / video of it on a stand.   Did you assemble it out of a box or did a shop do it? Does the rear derailleur visibly move and stay in a new position with each click? I'd also check the chain for the quicklink/point where you pinned it to make sure that link is good and a pin isn't sticking out or the quick link not locked properly."

bikewrench,3e4p8k,NoImJustLooking,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:43:11 2015 UTC,"First off, the bike tech you talked to is an idiot. Though, in their defense, you did say in your last post here that you had no nearby LBS.   If possible, you can try to take it to a performance bikes if there's one near you. They own nashbar, and while that means they didn't sell you the bike and have zero obligation to help you with it, you might find a little bit of sympathy with them if you're really nice about it.  That said, you haven't answered the question as to who built this new bicycle. It was a mail order bike, and it should have been looked over by somebody who knows something about gears.  The chain wrapping, or ""sucking"" around the front chainring is troubling. That means something is either very wrong with the front derailleur, or the chain is bent. Since the gears in the back seem to be affected too, my money is on the chain and not necessarily the front derailleur.   We're talking bent laterally, like side-to-side. If you pedal the bike backwards, without you on the bike, it might catch and hang up on the rear derailleur or the cassette. Or if you just examine the chain from above while pedaling backwards slowly, you might be able to see a kink or twist. This can be fixed only by replacing the 8 speed chain.   I wouldn't say it's the shifting, though maybe getthe new cables have seated in and are a little slack. That would cause the rear derailleur to pop back and forth between gears, but not ""slip.""  And one final note: forget the fixed gear conversion. It would cost more than the original cost of the bike to get a new fixed disc hub, eccentric english bottom bracket, and a 24mm spindle crankset."

A poorly set limit screw can cause you to wreck. As for your shifting problem, the issue is that your derailleur cable is too tight. This doesn't usually happen spontaneously so your derailleur may be out of alignment. If it's always been this way, it's probably the cable. Rotate the adjustment barrel on your front shifter clockwise in 1/8 turns until the problem is resolved. If you go too far you'll run into chain rubbing issues when cross-chaining.

bikewrench,3dyd4k,snakesign,5,Mon Jul 20 16:46:28 2015 UTC,Helium is very good at diffusing through stuff which is one of the reasons it's used for vacuum system leak detection. In that process you blow He on the outside of a running vacuum chamber and monitor a mass spectrometer inside the chamber. When you get a spike in He (which is normally a very small fraction of the atmosphere) you've found a leak! It's even more fun when the system is hooked up to some audible feedback system so you can hear when you've found a leak (since you're usually crawling around looking for them).   Hydrogen is so good at defusing through metal that the way the metal ingots are rolled out matters when building a vacuum vessel. The slag in the center of the ingot forms channels that gas can seep in through.   Source examples would be O'Hanlon's a user's guide to vacuum technology

bikewrench,3dw81s,Piece_Maker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:21:22 2015 UTC,"The idea is the ""open"" edge of the bar tape's overlap is pointed in the direction your hands apply pressure to the tape."

bikewrench,3dw81s,FalseBuddha,2,Mon Jul 20 04:02:09 2015 UTC,How would the plug come out? Normally they're in there so tight that I have to use tools to get them free when re-wrapping.

bikewrench,3dw81s,Verdris,2,Mon Jul 20 03:43:06 2015 UTC,"It's ""wrong"" because your hands will rest against the sides of the bar tape.  But again, I've never had a problem with it. Although I only put in about 130 miles a week.    It just never made sense to me how people will spend $2k or $3k on a bike, then slap electrical tape on it right off the bat.  It's like buying a Porsche and putting masking tape on the rearview mirror."
bikewrench,3dw81s,respectwalk,2,Mon Jul 20 04:04:47 2015 UTC,"I do it this way, as well. Works great, and no tape necessary. The only downside is that when you need to re-do cables/housing, you have to unwrap the entire bar, not just to the hoods. Not a big deal, though."
bikewrench,3dw81s,Sumpm,2,Mon Jul 20 10:22:30 2015 UTC,This sounds interesting. Can you please explain your technique?  Do you overwrap at the beginning a couple times then go down the bar?

The ESI Road Grip comes with some kind of rubberized finishing tape strip, which we threw out because it didn't work.  Brooks Tape comes with cool little cloth strips that are exactly the same as cloth bar tape. But make a slick finishing tape for the leather.   Fizik comes with junk finishing tape, cinelli comes with trash, lizard skins is the same...Where did you last encounter the product you are looking for?

It should cost a dollar or two. Be sure to ask for two new ferrules (metal pieces that go onto the ends of the cable housing) and a cable tip (crimped onto the end of the cable itself to prevent fraying).  Install the new cable housing and follow this guide to get the derailleur adjusted. http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/rear-derailler-adjustments-derailleur"
bikewrench,3dwspe,xkkd,2,Mon Jul 20 14:50:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I really didn't realize that the housing was more than just a way to protect the cable...Now that it's been pointed out, it certainly makes sense that it affects the geometry.  I expect I will need a new cap for the tensioner, as well, so I may just take it in and get it done.  Thanks for the assistance!"
bikewrench,3dwspe,xkkd,2,Mon Jul 20 15:32:19 2015 UTC,"I had similar trouble with my new derailleur recently, and the reason was because the cable's housing did not reach from a holding point on the bike, to the actual derailleur.

Thanks for the suggestion!"
bikewrench,3dwspe,wrongwayjay,3,Mon Jul 20 14:45:26 2015 UTC,"It's hard to explain without physically showing you, but the housing makes the cable go around the derailleur. When it doesn't, the derailleur acts as a pivot point and the cable only pulls the derailleur up, instead of increasing tension on the spring inside. Not sure if that explanation is 100% right, but it goes something like that :)"
bikewrench,3dw8m9,brodie1600,2,Mon Jul 20 01:30:36 2015 UTC,"This might be caused by dried up grease in your shifter mechanism; Shimano is notorious for this. The solution is to hose down the mechanism with a penetrating lubricant (even WD-40 is close enough for this purpose), let it soak, work the shifters, repeat.  If after you get everything loose and the shifter is still bad, it's possible the pawls/gears in your shifter are just plain worn out, requiring a replacement. It's also possible that your shifter cable is binding (rust on the cable is a warning sign of this).  If it works, though, you may still need to adjust the shifters so they index the gears correctly."
bikewrench,3dw8m9,pthu,2,Mon Jul 20 02:23:57 2015 UTC,Applied some WD-40 to both shifters and that seemed to do the trick. I also pushed that hammer-type thing of the right shifter into the center a bit with a screwdriver. I now see that it wasn't catching onto the tiny spokes of the gear. Thanks for the advice!
bikewrench,3dw8m9,pthu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:55:32 2015 UTC,"Great!  Now that things are working, others will point out that you should re-grease. The problem is that it's not realistically feasible to get grease in just the right spots in a fully-assembled shifter mechanism like this.  Instead, oil is a reasonable compromise as long as you re-oil every once in a while. Once the WD-40 evaporates, drip some mineral oil in there both to lubricate and to prevent rust."
bikewrench,3dw8m9,gootgen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:04:53 2015 UTC,"If the penetrating lubricant doesn't help, i would check at your local bike co-op for a replacement. They usually have loads of those kind of shifters to sell for few bucks."

bikewrench,3dui6d,Rhyk,4,Sun Jul 19 19:02:18 2015 UTC,"Stick it in a stand/upside down and see if you can find a sprocket/chainring combo that causes your chain to touch the derailleur. If you can, loosen the bracket holding the front mech onto your seat tube and twist it just enough that it's no longer in contact. Spin through your gears and repeat until you get a satisfactory outcome.   Note that if you've got a triple chainring with anything more than a six/seven speed cassette then you'll probably still get some rubbing if you're in the smallest gear on the big ring, or the biggest gear on the small ring."

Don't ask for advice on parts you don't buy there.  Understand there will be a wait.   Buy the small parts from the shop (rim tape, tubes,  etc)  Be patient.   Listen to the mrchanics advice."

I want a good price and the XD-lite might not be the best or easiest rim to get hold of, but I don't want to be the jack-ass who asks for campag wheels on a shimano bike because I think they ""look faster"".  I'll take your advice."
bikewrench,3dv0w7,p34y95p9hfcsd,5,Sun Jul 19 22:22:47 2015 UTC,"Personally I would re-lace a disc rim that is true, it's not like it's worn out and at risk of breaking from a thin braking surface. If it's been used as a road commuter the rim should be in decent shape.   If you unlace the wheel yourself you'd save some labour costs and it's pretty easy to do. Do a couple of rounds of undoing each spoke, don't just completely undo one at a time.  You can see if the LBS can even order a dynohub for you and if they can't then just buy whatever hub you want and bring your rim in with it and get a regular wheelbuild. In my country distributors stock very few rims and would rather just sell whole wheels.  Finding the shimano dynohub in 36 holes might mean ordering it from Europe, in which case you might as well order the lights from one of the German sites at the same time. The B&M lights are hands-down the best value out there, I use them for brevet riding in all weather and on my city commuter and they've been working steady for years without any problems."
bikewrench,3dv0w7,audiocycle,3,Mon Jul 20 00:42:55 2015 UTC,"Professional wrench here, this is what I think:  It's not worth it to relace a rim you've been riding daily for the last two years, especially not an Alexrims (due to their value)  Out of courtesy I'd ask your LBS if they can order the exact rim for you. If not, it's really easy to understand you ordering it online to have matching rims on your bike. Most shops have straight gauge stainless spokes in stock, this would be just fine. They might have a delay if they need to order a specific length for your rim/hub combination (dyno hubs have wider flanges and thus require more atypical lengths)  As long as you're not an ass and order compatible parts, I have no problem working on parts coming from elsewhere. Expect to pay full price on labor though.  If you have any more questions just ask!  Edit: switched replace to relace, I'm on mobile  Edit2: Imo having a non-dyno but compatible spare wheel could be useful. That way you have a drag-less wheel if you plan on doing a short daytime ride."
bikewrench,3dv0w7,audiocycle,2,Sun Jul 19 20:13:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  I'll get chatting to my local LBS some time next week.   It's not worth it to replace a rim you've been riding daily for the last two years, especially not an Alexrims (due to their value)   This is the bit that had been bugging me.  As they are Alexrims I would think about replacing the whole wheel set.  I've used Alexrims before and found them............sufficient.  Some of their rims are very budget and I've shipped them on ASAP, but these rims so far have been rather good - little flex, well built, reliable, true and long lasting.  The eyelets look good but I have no idea how they would cope with being stripped and rebuilt.  Rims like H Plus Sons appear to be hitting the performance/value spot and if it wasn't for the IHG, I would just be both wheels built with a 105/Ultegra level rear hub and dynamo front.  If I was going to go for a complete refresh, then it would be a new Alfine rear hub, two new rims, dynamo front hub and a whole higher budget - out of the question at the moment.  From what I understand the Alexrims were part of an OEM deal with the bike manufactorer so only a few XD-lites were on general release - I've seen the rim needed on eBay.de but I know others have had difficulty on sourcing them too.  I think the rest of the build (spoke lengths etc) should be straightforward regardless of reused or new rim.  Just for clarification:  your first choice would be rebuild or replace?"
bikewrench,3dv0w7,grantrules,3,Sun Jul 19 20:39:44 2015 UTC,"I did a typo. I would recommend replacing the rim. IMO it's not worth the cost and time to relace that rim on a new hub. It might be running true and all but it has already seen some good mileage so unless you do it yourself (no labour cost) I would invest in a new rim.  Whichever you choose you will pay for new spokes and, I assume, labour so add a little for a new rim and you have a brand new wheel AND a functional backup."
bikewrench,3dubyl,wigglrpop,2,Sun Jul 19 15:36:18 2015 UTC,"99% sure it's a Maxy/Super Maxy. Apparently they produced a few variations of it, some were machined differently, like some have the Fuji branding and some have Sugino branding, also the spider cutouts are on some but not others.  Velobase and google image search back up this opinion pretty solidly IMO.  As far as price, idk, not very much. It's really nice looking, but it's also obsolete tech and was not that amazing of a crankset to begin with.   A friend of mine has this crankset on one of his bikes.

Shimano calls it a b-link.  http://www.bikerumor.com/2012/04/25/soc12-a-second-look-at-shimanos-new-dh-groupos/   The Zee derailleur also allows riders to swap between different sized cassettes by swapping out the B-Links. The derailleur will come standard with the DH oriented knuckle for use with 11-28 cassettes.   DH specific b-link shown at: http://www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Zee-B-Link-600x399.jpg

To realign it use a standard derailleur alignment tool like you'd use for the main derailleur hanger."
bikewrench,3dtf2m,cmags,3,Sun Jul 19 11:41:45 2015 UTC,"Though I'm not sure what you'd call this part,  it is not the hanger that you're referring to.  The upper bolt will bolt to the hanger,  whether integrated into the frame or replaceable.  The hanger is always a frame part.   This seems to be just a free swinging  linkage in the derailleur design to allow the derailleur to sit more compact (for more trail/obstacle  clearance)  and to let the cable housing route straight instead of making that old fashioned loop around to the backside of the body (which could also snag obstacles)."

With out your rotor or other spacer in there the piston couldn't retract properly causing it to bind. If you're lucky you might be able to just remove your brake pads and push it back with a screw driver. Otherwise, you'll have to pull apart and rebuild your brake."
bikewrench,3dv0j0,What_a_rubbish_user,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:47:42 2015 UTC,I think the best tool for that is a tire lever. It has a good shape and (assuming yours is a plastic one like mine) won't damage the pistons.  It should not be necessary to rebuild the caliper unless a piston came out.
bikewrench,3dv0j0,Vojta7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:13:58 2015 UTC,Ahh thanks. I pulled the pads out and pushed the rotor in. It wasn't really stuck too bad though. One thing I noticed I put the wheel back on while in the stand and it spun smooth. I put on the ground and reset the QR skewer and I noticed it settled a little and then the rotor was rubbing again. It's almost like I should have a spacer or the wheel/fork alignment could be off?
bikewrench,3dtmhi,xeonblade,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:49:28 2015 UTC,"It will work, set it so the the granny to middle shift shifts between the two rings otherwise you can end up needing to upshift twice if you accidentally downshift too many times"
bikewrench,3dtmhi,TheBicyclist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:46:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, it will work, but it's not at all optimal. Typically what i'd do for a setup like that (Which 9/10 times is because someone's too cheap to buy the proper shifters) is to lock out one shift and set the cable tension normally. This way 7 shifts are going to do exactly what you need and the 8th simply won't do anything. I also prefer to set the shifter one gear up from the bottom when setting it up so that you have slack on one end, and not super super tightness on the other. This way, if you forget that you're at the top of your range you don't accidentally blow up your shifter by forcing it over.  TL;DR- Set front shifter to 2, and rear shifter to 2 and then set up your drivetrain normally. Make sure to set limits properly."
bikewrench,3dt8fj,Tamagi0,4,Sun Jul 19 05:53:43 2015 UTC,"I see more cosmetic issues than anything.  Steel is generally very strong and resilient, and a lot of metal has to rust away before safety becomes an issue.

Just imagine one of those kinks giving out as you're charging down a hill and taking a corner.  I know how you feel, though.  I was in a crash this year that bent the top and down tubes of my beloved hybrid bike.  I'm really sad about it.  I commuted over 3k miles on that bike and even did my first triathlon on it.  It was the bike I was riding as I started a personal fitness revolution.  So it pains me to have it sitting out in the shed, knowing I can never safely ride it again.  Even if I could somehow bend it back (it's a steel frame), I could never trust it to not just catastrophically fail on me."

bikewrench,3dt8fj,fireanddesire,3,Tue Jul 21 01:25:22 2015 UTC,"If you like the bike a lot it might be worth the cost of sending it to a good powdercoating place, not just a random guy on craigslist that claims to be good at it. I got a frame done at a place that does all kinds of auto parts and industrial stuff and they blasted it clean and coated it nicely without hiding the details or coating any of the threads or crown race. I would expect to pay 100-200$ for a good blast and powder. You might also want to investigate why the seatpost needs a shim, if the tube is out of round that can be a bit of work to fix and a lot of shops don't really do stuff like that anymore.  Then you'll wanna rebuild the bike with new stainless cables, new chain and freewheel. That's easily another 100$ in parts.   This bike looks like something that was sold at hardware stores or department stores in Canada in the 1970s. I've seen a few come through our local co-op and they aren't bad bikes.  Honestly I would spend the money and look for a similar bike that's in better shape or save up for something a bit more modern like a 1980s touring bike or even a vintage MTB (drop bar conversions aren't that expensive) can do all the commuting and touring you'd want."
bikewrench,3dt8fj,Hagenaar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:56:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions. I had assumed the bits that stick out for the bolt to clamp down on the seat post were what had fatigued. Do you mean the tube might have ovaled? And yea, was already going to replace many of the drive train components.  1970's! That's ... older than I had expected. But she's been very good to me since I bought her and hasn't really let me down over the ~9000k I've put her through. Till I let her down anyway."
bikewrench,3dt8fj,fireanddesire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:57:32 2015 UTC,"Seeing as the bike was exposed to so much salt you might be SOL when it comes to dis-assembly. I've taken apart hundreds of shitty old bikes in better and worse shape than yours and parts sometimes aren't really removable. Salt water leads to galvanic corrosion and I would guess that the stem is probably seized in place. The crankarms might also be really hard to remove. Bottom bracket cups might be seized in place.   If you can't get the bike down to a bare frame there's really no point in painting it. I would probably just retire this bike so it can get recycled into something new, all the rust and seized parts are really the end of a bike's life. If the stem is seized you'll never be able to raise the handlebars or service the headset.   Looking at the parts a bit more I would guess it's more likely from the 80s but still it had a better ""life"" than most bikes that only get ridden a few times a year and buried in someone's garage."

It will reveal most of the issues and problems. Strip it down. Use the proper tools (a crap 13mm spanner for a 13mm nut is better than a top quality 1/2"" spanner for a 13mm nut). Take notes and use your phone to document exactly how things are disassembled (this will help put it back together) Dont throw anything away. Its a weird french bike and parts may be hard to get. Inspect the parts when disassembled   (esp. The frame) make a note of what needs replacing. Ask your LBS for advice if unsure. Create a rebuild parts list. Dont assume that because it came off the bike, an exact replacement is the right way to go. Its old, it might have had many a fudge to keep it going. Ask your dad if he remembers any problems it had, ""Yes son, it had a new rear cog-thingy and the damn thing never worked properly after that so i gave up on it..""  Would tell you the the new cog-thingy was actually wrong. Don't be tempted to ""restore"" it. Restoration is far more costly than preservation and imho, preserving old machines is far better. A good clean and lacquer coat on the frame is the way to go. Use the internet. Treat this as a project to teach you how bikes work. Google everything.

That's not hyperbole; a bike that size is really fucking hard to come by unless you have one custom made.  Decent lugwork + bar end shifters + quick releases + probably alloy wheels = probably a really decent bike.  For a bike of that size you're talking about a fair bit of money on craigslist if you're willing to wait for a buyer.  Like I said: folks that need a bike that size usually need a custom frame.  If that was mine and I'd done the stuff below I'd be asking like $400 (but I'm no craigslist flipping pro) because bikes in that size are really hard to come by in the first place and bikes that aren't complete shit that size are really fucking rare.

Here are the steps:  1- Take the chain off. 2- Take the old RD off. 3- Set the B-Screw of the new RD to the same level (counting threads helps) 4- Bolt it on. 5- Set H and L screws. 6- Attach the cable loosely (shifter to the smallest cog) 7- Reinstall the chain. 8- Shift to the 2nd cog. 9- Tighten the cable by using the barrel adjuster 10- Shift to the 3rd cog. 11- Find the right barrel adjuster setting by going back and forth 2nd and 3rd cogs. 12- Done.  It helps a lot to have a working stand. Flipping the bike upside down doesn't really work. You can find a volunteer to lift the rear side up or just buy a rear triangle stand like this. They're pretty cheap."
bikewrench,3dr1s3,uluchay,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:03:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know why the others are getting more yours than you. Adjusting shifting on a freshly installed derailleur isn't that hard. It takes a couple minutes too dial out in but be systematic about it and it's moi big deal. I use the system you describe but to start, I adjust the barrel adjuster with the shifter in the lowest gear until it starts to make noise on the second cog. Then I back of a little and go from there. At that point I'm pretty darn close to emerge I need to be."

Used to work at a shop and this is how I was taught.  Cables tend to stretch/slip over time and leaving more adjustment available via barrel adj. is best practice when installing a derailleur."
bikewrench,3dr1s3,mpbikeman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:46:23 2015 UTC,"Well maybe loosely isn't the right word. It's kind of hard to put into words. The cable should be perfectly straight and have almost zero tension.  Also depends on where you start with the barrel adjuster. If you start somewhere in the middle some tension could be necessary. I start with the barrel screwed all the way in, then tension the cable by unscrewing."
bikewrench,3dr1s3,uluchay,2,Sun Jul 19 07:16:27 2015 UTC,"Removing and installing a new one isn't that hard. But adjusting the new one to shift properly may give you some trouble since you mention you have very little experience. You will need a chain breaker tool to remove the chain from the old derailer. You'll also need some way to put the chain back together. Your chain may have a special link on it that allows you to disassemble and reassemble it. Look at all the links on your chain to see if one looks different than the rest. If it has a special link, you won't need a chain breaker tool, but you'll need some way to open that special link. There are a few different kinds.  Removing the derailer usually just involves unscrewing one hex bolt and loosening the bolt which secures the shifter cable. Installing the new one again is just screwing in one hex bolt. Though you'll need to properly route the chain through the derailer pulleys as well. Take a picture of how it's routed through it now and refer to that when putting it back together.  For adjusting shifting, there are many good YouTube videos on this. If you can't get it shifting right after all this, you can always take it to a shop and they'll fix it for you. You're not likely to make anything worse I don't think."

Advanced skills being things like replacing headsets, cold-setting a frame, or installing and adjusting hydraulic disc brake systems.  If you have a friction shifter it shouldn't be to bad if you're mechanically inclined.  Tutorials or youtube videos should be enough.  However if the shifting is indexed it could get tricky.  But again if you're mechanically inclined you could probably do a passably good job.  If you don't feel naturally mechanically inclined... and if you have the cash and aren't super keen to learn on your own, just have a pro do it."

bikewrench,3drxwb,ysengrimus,2,Sun Jul 19 03:02:12 2015 UTC,"In fact you would need a real metallurgist with experience working on welded and heat-treated 7005 to answer that question for good(though Kona's answer is clear and probably very well informed). It would also depend on the temperature reliability of the ovens used by the painters and temperature needed for their specific paint (might change with colours? Idk)  Imo both Kona and the thread are pretty clear. Don't do it unless you are in contact with real professional painters experienced in the matter and conscious of the precautions needed and risks associated. If they bake the frame too hot, you'll lose all mechanical properties of your alloy and end up with a soft pile of shit.  I'd say go for some quality spray paint or get it anodized, forget powder coating."
bikewrench,3ds1qx,Shroffinator,5,Sat Jul 18 22:22:12 2015 UTC,"Mineral spirits won't strip the frame paint since Schwinn probably used some baked on enamel or something heavy duty but should wipe away most of the other grime. Oxalic acid can work well on cleaning all the little rust specks too, it's sold at paint stores as wood bleach. You can make a little pool for the frame with some plastic sheeting. I make a pretty weak solution and it works well, too strong a solution will leave a tenacious residue.  Meguirs make some polishing type stuff that can also make old paint really shine, I would try that before stripping and refinishing."

If it feels like it's engaging where you want it to, make sure that the pads are retracting fully. If they're not, you can GENTLY push the pads back with a screwdriver, and force the pistons to compress. That might help in aligning the pads.  Take a shot at this too- 8/10 times you can set the position of the caliper by loosening the retaining bolts, squeezing the brake lever so that it bites the rotor, and tightening the bolts back down. If the rotor's not warped it'll probably be dead center.  If you don't have any success let me know- I might ask for some pictures."

Your bike used to have 3 chainrings up front, but was clearly swapped. If the front derailleur and shifter work, then no worries. Your rear mech has two ""limit screws"" tighten the one closer to the wheel and it should keep the mech from throwing the chain into the spokes. Might take a bit of fiddling, but simple fix.

bikewrench,3doy00,helzar42,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:36:31 2015 UTC,I will second that bigger is better. Just make sure you will have the clearance on your bike. For 700x25 you most likely will. However any bigger and it may not fit. 700x28 does not fit my madone.   Scwable One is my personal favorite tire. It has fair puncture resistance for a race tire.
bikewrench,3doy00,atalanta_run,2,Sat Jul 18 02:30:05 2015 UTC,I hope that was a joke about the pronunciation of Schwalbe. I know the Schwalbe One is a relatively new tire. Do you have much experience with other tires? I was thinking about trying out the tubeless one when I wear out my fusions.
bikewrench,3doy00,shitfucksniffglue,2,Sat Jul 18 03:51:38 2015 UTC,"Not intentionally a joke. Just my fat thumbs and rushing to reply on my phone misspelled the Schwalbe.   Anyways, I don't have gobs of experience chronologically for reviewing tires. I do love tinkering and trying lots of tires though. In the past season (since March this year) I've tried; GP 4000, Pro 4 Service course ($30 at Competitive cyclist right now), Schwalbe One, Bontrager Hard case, and Bontrager R1.   Of Those 5, the Schwalbe is the most supple, most comfortable, and my favorite in corners. It feels really consistent cornering at 90psi in the 25 width. I never punctured with the tire (Around 1000 miles on a pair so far). I just replaced the rear tire for the first time after having to come to an emergency stop and skidding along the asphalt for a bit (wires started to show).   Can't comment on the tubeless variety."
bikewrench,3doy00,atalanta_run,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:17:56 2015 UTC,"i've been following the writing of Jan Heine, of Bicycle Quarterly; he has been pushing the cycling world to take a fresh look at tires, essentially concluding that wider, supple tires at lower pressures can be as fast or faster than conventional road tires; here's an example article note that the discussions in the comments of this blog can be most illuminating — you will find insights into flat avoidance for example  (not everyone agrees with Heine's tire philosophy, and it's worth noting Heine has a financial interest in Compass Bicycles, which sells a range of tires)  how wide you can go will, of course, depend on your rims and your frame/fork; i've put 50mm Schwalbe Big Apples on my Pake C'mute — i'm very happy with the comfort and they don't feel slow; my cheap Aksium rims are a bit narrow for these tires, but because the sidewall is fairly stiff i don't get a rolling problem in corners; when i can afford it i'll get some wider rims and more supple, lighter tires in the 50mm range"

bikewrench,3doy00,scottybee915,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:16:03 2015 UTC,"Just look for the highest TPI (threads per inch) you can get.   All other things being equal, yes, higher TPI is better. One caveat however: manufacturers typically add the TPI of each layer of casing (for example the Conti GP4 are probably 3 layers of 110TPI). Ideally, you want 80+ /layer, but most makers don't give detailed specs, so someone's 200 TPI could be 2x100, and another company's 200TPI is 3x60. Then you get into casing materials, thread size (which is related to weave tightness and therefore stiffness), and on and on...  All that said, I don't think there are any truly crappy tires that advertise 300+ TPI, and the Conti's that /u/VigilantEcho mentioned are a known favorite."
bikewrench,3doy00,howmanydads,2,Sat Jul 18 04:19:41 2015 UTC,"right, what matters is the fineness of the thread, not the number of threads; TPI, if consistently measured, would correlate somewhat well with suppleness, but wouldn't be a perfect measure"

bikewrench,3dok9h,beardedllamadotnet,9,Fri Jul 17 23:34:50 2015 UTC,"Look at picture 2 you posted. See the ""22"", that represents the grip diameter of the bar, 22.2 mm. That size is usually seen on upright bars or older British bars. The common ISO for vintage bikes is 23.8.  It's a size that still used today, so you shouldn't have a problem finding it at a your LBS. The only issue is if it will fit the brake levers, so bring them with you.  If it were me. I'd opt for finding another set of levers. The ones you have are modified suicide levers. They used to have a lever on the side as well (that's what that big screw is for). Plus they aren't made for hoods which is not so comfy.  If you don't care about period correct you can get some Tektro or Dia Compe BRS levers for around $20. If you have a local bike co-op, you could probably get a set of used levers for a few bucks.  You're probably saying, $20 is almost as much as I paid for the bike. That's the downside to vintage bikes. You can definitely score but always plan on putting cash into them.  BTW, those things are called brake lever clamps.  Edited for typos"

bikewrench,3dok9h,essef_sf,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:09:29 2015 UTC,"Ha. NP. It was a hard lesson learned when I got into vintage bikes.   I get a lot of friends and co-workers asking me to help them find a vintage bike. It always sounds rad in theory, but from a cash standpoint, if you want something nice, you could easily spend what a new bike would cost. I did a mixte for a friend. The frame and wheels were $60. After everything she wanted on it/done to it, it came out to about $1500.  I usually tell people to estimate about $150-$200 on top of asking to get the bike riding reliably. Even when it's advertised as ""fully restored"", unless I can check it out. I always think it's a good idea to take it to someone who knows what to look for.  I've seen ""fully restored"" stuff listed, only to check it out and find that there is a ripple in the downtube, the fork is bent, etc. I don't blame the seller all the time, they usually don't know what to look for as some of the impact points and stress risers can be kinda' tricky to spot.  I would say the things you need to concentrate on besides the levers are new brake pads, tires (you already did that, good call), a chain (99% of the time these are shot) and a basic tune-up.  I get super anal though and also think you should replace the cabling, repack the hubs/headset/bottom bracket with new grease and bearings, then make sure any parts that are metal on metal are lubricated.  One way to save cash is to take a class your read about basic repairs. Some stuff is crazy easy and with LBS minimum labor rates, it can be totally worth it.   Send me a private message if you have questions."

Took the bike in, staff there immediately noticed a bent fork. Now I'm in $30 for the bike/wheels, $40 for new tires/tubes, and $50ish for a new frame. I'm sure never brake levers and repairs will be another $20-25.   Thank you again for your reply! I will probably be taking you up on the offer for repair advice :-)."

bikewrench,3donql,kopsis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:49:31 2015 UTC,"Officially, both the SS and GS cages support a 28t max cog. That doesn't mean it won't work with a 32t, but it isn't guaranteed."

bikewrench,3donql,audiocycle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:17:12 2015 UTC,The cage ripping off was probably a bad limit adjustment rather than a too big sprocket. A too big cassette will simply rub on the uppermost derailleur pulley.

It actually would shift into the 32, but just barely, and at one point probably under a bit of stress it failed during the shift from 28 to 32. Either t he edge of the 32 acted as a fulcrum to tip the bottom of the cage or throwing into the spokes was just an aftermath of a failure derived otherwise."
bikewrench,3donql,w1n5t0nM1k3y,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:00:09 2015 UTC,"Also, I'm pretty sure Shimano changed the cable pull ratio on the 10 speed mountain deraillers, so the aren't compatible with road brifters. I couldn't find a definitive source, but it's something to look into. This differs from the situation with 7-8-9 speed components where mountain and road components were compatible."
bikewrench,3donql,audiocycle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:27:44 2015 UTC,"Your road derailleur can probably not take sprockets this big, we would need the exact generation number to make sure. Cage length has more to do with the size difference between your chainrings than anything else. Shimano RDs are generally limited to 27-29 max sprocket sizes, no matter the cage length.   Edit: you can possibly push it up to 30 by maxing out your b-screw but I doubt any more than that"
bikewrench,3dmlht,haltbro,10,Fri Jul 17 14:24:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, you need a shock pump. Shocks/forks are very high pressure, low volume air chambers. A floor pump is likely not going to be able to latch onto the air chamber schrader valve, or get you the pressure or precision you need for air suspension.   I don't use my shock pump often once I find the proper air pressure, as suspension seems to hold pressure pretty well compared to tires. But not having a way to play with air pressure or check it regularly is doing your nice suspension a disservice."
bikewrench,3dmlht,D0rk4L,5,Fri Jul 17 14:45:14 2015 UTC,Related question. Does the pressure of an air shock affect it's travel? Or just the amount of force required to move through its full range?
bikewrench,3dmlht,zmoney92,10,Fri Jul 17 15:24:16 2015 UTC,"if by ""affect its travel"" you mean make the available travel longer/shorter, then no, that is a mechanical limitation.  It does greatly affect the force required to move through that travel though."
bikewrench,3dmlht,nhluhr,6,Fri Jul 17 15:30:22 2015 UTC,"to add to what /u/nhluhr said, if the pressure is too low, you can have much more sag than desired which is in turn reducing the amount of useable travel."
bikewrench,3dmlht,jimmynibbler,2,Fri Jul 17 15:35:03 2015 UTC,"ah yes, thanks for pointing that out!  I guess it effectively reduces travel since you're starting more compressed with low pressure."
bikewrench,3dmlht,nhluhr,3,Fri Jul 17 15:44:54 2015 UTC,I personally use my shock pump each time I ride.  At the very least I use it just to make sure the PSI in my shocks are what I need them to be at and add a little air as needed. Shock pumps are a crucial piece of MTB equipment and cannot be interchanged with schrader or presta floor pumps
bikewrench,3dmlht,Log_Dog,6,Fri Jul 17 16:23:26 2015 UTC,"Forks and shocks can maintain pressure for months with little change. In my experience they lose maybe 5 PSI over nine months. Every ride is excessive. You are probably just letting air out when you put the pump on, and then adding it back."
bikewrench,3dmlht,vertr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:32:14 2015 UTC,"I agree every ride is a bit much, but 5 psi is a significant change."
bikewrench,3dmlht,morningr,4,Fri Jul 17 17:47:06 2015 UTC,Nine months. The takeaway is... maybe check it once a month.
bikewrench,3dmlht,vertr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:51:38 2015 UTC,"The typical shock pump is bad at checking pressure, since you are filling the pump hose up with air until it is the same pressure as the air chamber of the shock when you attach it. Since the air volume is quite small, you typically reduce the air pressure in the shock quite a bit depending of the size of your pump, so the refilling you are doing is probably just replacing the air you let out into the shock hose.   Pump it up, notice the pressure for future reference, and ride it is my approach. Shocks should be pretty much set and forget for longer periods of time once you have found your correct sag, otherwise something is probably wrong. On the other hand, there is nothing wrong about experimenting with different pressures to find your ideal shock setup."
bikewrench,3dmlht,crab_man,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:59:05 2015 UTC,What /u/vertr said. Don't need to use it every ride. If you are actually losing air over the span of a week the fork/shock needs servicing.

bikewrench,3dmlht,morningr,2,Fri Jul 17 17:45:46 2015 UTC,"I know everyone is commenting the opposite, but your specific model has a low volume, high pressure setting.  Set it to it's ""Stage 3"" setting it should work just fine.  I know of multiple local LBS that use floor pumps similar to yours to do suspension setup.  The real question is if the head of the pump will hold tight enough."

If the pulleys are out of alignment, that could mean that the derailleur hanger may be bent, or you're just noticing the slight bit of play required for a shimano guide pulley.   Can't read the derailleur, it's too dark in the video, but the cassette looks like an 8 speed? With the plastic pedals and the steel chainrings, (ignoring the Magna in the background) it's not too high-end of a bicycle, and a sound like that is par for the course with that level of components."

bikewrench,3dmsuo,Bathorhythm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:19:56 2015 UTC,"But it's new, right? Perhaps the honeyglow has worn off and you're noticing the sounds now.  I'm also not the type of mechanic that rips on anything that's not built for racing. Everything has its place, and entry-level bicycles are still better than the BSO's that big box stores sell. It will function for years without issues, but the amount of plastic and steel, along with the rougher/larger machining will make things sound a little different.  I'm weird with the sounds. I worked with an older blind bicycle mechanic, you learn to use sounds a little more. I'm always trying to figure that aspect in more to my work, in case I meet a young blind mechanic that wants to learn how to wrench, now that the school for the blind is gone."

bikewrench,3dmsuo,whabt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:10:09 2015 UTC,"Mine makes that noise when I'm in the big ring and in the 3rd gear out of 9 on the cassette.

bikewrench,3dnbrs,BukketsofNothing,2,Fri Jul 17 19:02:58 2015 UTC,"I second the compact and 12-28.   A compact is a good choice regardless and the 12-28 is a good middle of the road cassette, you can always size up or down on subsequent replacements"
bikewrench,3dm1fd,seager,3,Fri Jul 17 10:46:12 2015 UTC,"Ideal? No, probably not. Safe? I would say yes. It wasn't too long ago the average MTB rim was ~19-24mm and riders were running 2.1""+ (50c) tires all day long. Wider rims are a fairly recent trend, whereas wider tires have existed forever."
bikewrench,3dm1fd,jeseely,2,Fri Jul 17 12:18:28 2015 UTC,According to http://www.weinmanntek.com/Products/RACE/DP18.htm the rim width is 12.4mm on that rim. According to Sheldon Brown's tire width chart at http://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html#width that will probably not be safe.
bikewrench,3dm1fd,evenflow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:44:37 2015 UTC,Those are in fact very narrow rims that won't be ideal for a tire that wide.  Basically you'd have a much higher risk of pinch flat for a given pressure as well as more likely for the bead to not seat correctly.

bikewrench,3dm1fd,throwinit9,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:03:30 2015 UTC,"Check to see if the manufacturer has a rim pressure rating. As tires get wider, they exert more force outward on the rim. Since its 29.5 I am assuming its an MTB rim, which may have been designed for lower pressure applications."

With new pads you have to ""set"" them though.  Go out and so some heavy breaking while riding to set the pads, then see if it still rubs."

bikewrench,3dkybe,FreeRideJunkie,2,Fri Jul 17 04:21:18 2015 UTC,This! There were several times where I'd be using the Park disc truing tool while using an adjustable wrench to help isolate the section of the rotor that I was focusing on truing. The actual tool is great but it really is unnecessary for your occasional minor adjustments.
bikewrench,3dkybe,NoImJustLooking,3,Fri Jul 17 07:10:38 2015 UTC,Rotor truing fork is what you're looking for. Real cheap. Real easy.
bikewrench,3dkybe,Remington_Underwood,3,Fri Jul 17 03:57:00 2015 UTC,"Start out using only enough force to flex the rotor a slightly.  If that doesn't do the trick, add slightly more force, then repeat as needed."
bikewrench,3dkybe,Awesomebox5000,3,Fri Jul 17 06:04:51 2015 UTC,"Small, simple bends are worth truing. Large and/or complex bends sometimes aren't. A basic rotor is going to run you ~$40 (at least in my shop), I might have something in the back for less...  If you've got a little ringing, that's probably fixable. I recently went over a cactus and had to ditch the bike in some rocks. Spent about 2 hours trying to work the rotor back and decided my time was worth more than effort it was going to take to fix the damned thing."
bikewrench,3dkybe,Awesomebox5000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:50:35 2015 UTC,Yea its the tiniest bend. It just makes a ringing/grindy sound when it rubs. It literally moves back and forth in the free space between the pads and the rotor itself ( couple millimeters of wobble ) to give you an idea on how tiny it is. Just is really annoying when im on a nice quiet path to hear that noise every time the wheel rotates.
bikewrench,3dkybe,john78901,3,Fri Jul 17 13:34:22 2015 UTC,"Something I forgot to note in my original comment is that when braking the rotor gets crazy hot, this will often cause the bend to come return a bit so you'll often have to work the rotor true, then go ride the brakes, then true some more. It's best to take small bites because you can easily introduce more wobble than was already there."

bikewrench,3dkiwu,Log_Dog,3,Fri Jul 17 00:32:57 2015 UTC,"Because for a lot of people, a 44t is just too big of a chainring for offroad use, even on open fire/access roads. So they remove it and often replace it with a bash guard so they have a bit more ground clearance and make the shifting a bit simpler."
bikewrench,3dkiwu,D0rk4L,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:42:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I did. Plus, the bash guard saves your other rings when you misjudge an obstacle and - bash into it!"

bikewrench,3dkqj6,rawmetal,3,Fri Jul 17 14:38:27 2015 UTC,"In addition to what rawmetal said, don't look for  indications from riding.  By the time you can tell that something's going on with your shocks as you ride, they're a fair chance that the fork is already going to need new parts at best, and go in the garbage at worst.  Do the maintenance pro actively, not reactively."

I went to 4 or 5 different LBSes, and only the last of them was willing to do it instead of spewing some ""105 isn't compatible with ultegra"" bullshit. They also wouldn't sell me the body without doing the work themselves... That they refused to do...  Once I bought a tire in an even different LBS, but after 1 km and a flat I found out that the entire sidewall came loose. I went back and they accused me of doing something wrong. Got a new tire after loads of arguements with EACH employee in store (after being asked if I used pitchforks to get tires on, while I popped them on bare handed). Thing was: I couldn't just get the tire and go, I had to bring in my wheel ""so they could show me how it was done"". THEY HAD TO INSTALL the tire and belittle me while doing this. Next day after 2 km, entire sidewall was comming loose (No, no brakerub). Went back, demanded the same tire but from a different batch (25 instead of 23) and had no problems anymore. Had to pay for the tubes as they didn't want to refund them, as they were allready doing me ""an enormous favor"", at 7€ a pop ... I'm never going back there again, that's 5 out of 6."

bikewrench,3dio30,cbalzer,6,Thu Jul 16 16:09:41 2015 UTC,"I spent way too much time thinking about this in the past. I eventually decided to get a TW-1. The thing with the clicking style wrenches is you technically are supposed to keep them calibrated. No one does that. I knew I wasn't going to do that.  The bar style (eg the TW-1) can get out of calibration, but it's obvious. The bar won't point at 0. To fix it, you push it the other way until the bar points at 0. It's now recalibrated.  So I decided I'd rather have a bar wrench that I can be sure is calibrated properly, and can measure multiple values, than one of the click ones."
bikewrench,3dio30,quafflinator,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:22:26 2015 UTC,"I just stumbled across the Topeak ComboTorq Wrench and Bit Set . I think if I was buying one again, I'd look into buying that one. Seems convenient."
bikewrench,3dio30,quafflinator,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:25:24 2015 UTC,I have a bigger of the TW-1 (different brand) for car stuff and I find it really hard to read because either it's in an awkward position or the bar is always springing back and forth a bit.  I feel like a slightly out of calibration clicker wrench would probably be more accurate in light of that.  Or is there some trick to using the bar style that I don't know??
bikewrench,3dio30,mountainslayer,2,Thu Jul 16 22:22:26 2015 UTC,"Totally valid point. For me I normally am not trying to tighten to the exact max torque allowed, but to right around the proper value. For instance, if my seat post clamp is 6.2Nm I know that means max 6.2Nm, and I try and shoot for around 6. So a little bit of ""am I properly aligning my head to read that"" I'm not incredibly worried about.  Now, this sounds very counter to my earlier point, where I said I don't want something uncalibrated. For me the difference is ""I know I might be reading this bar slightly off, but it always works that way, and I can compensate"" versus ""it hasn't clicked yet, am I close, when did I get this calibrated, how much does it go out of whack when I don't calibrate it, ..."".  A known unknown versus an unknown unknown, if you will.  A known precision versus an unknown precision, if you won't."
bikewrench,3dio30,quafflinator,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:25:54 2015 UTC,"The clickers can get quite off on calibration, and they entice user error because they don't exhibit the same difference in static vs. kinetic friction or lend themselves to getting the user to understand it and torque smoothly and consistently.  I believe bar types have greater inherent accuracy as well since they are just based on material properties, so readout error has that on its side as well.  As for readout, I've never had difficulty orienting the torque wrench such that it approximately finishes in a readable position when used with the bike in a repair stand.  Just takes a bit of foresight."

bikewrench,3dioq2,SonsofWorvan,5,Thu Jul 16 16:14:26 2015 UTC,"You should start from the beginning with setting up.   Detach the cable, then check the derailleur alignment. Make sure the height is adequate, and make sure the side to side angle (as the der is clamped to the seat tube) is lined up with the chainrings.  Adjust the low limit.  Make sure the shifter is in the lowest gear and any barrel adjusters are screwed in.  Attach the cable, and check the high limit by pulling on the cable, not by using the shifter. After checking and adjusting the high limit, the cable may have seated itself and has gone a little slack. Detach, take out slack, and reattach. You can use a barrel adjuster here, but I prefer to use barrel adjusters when I don't have tools in my hands, like out on a ride.  Then check shifting with the shifter.

If OP has an adjustable bb that uses flats to remove the drive-side cup (rather than the Shimano splined tool), he/she can just use a large adjustable wrench on that side (not too expensive), and a lockring wrench on the non-drive side.  Labor at my shop is $30 for a bb reinstallation, so if OP bought a lockring wrench, spindle, and cup set (which include balls usually), the cost excluding the actual bb would be cheaper, and OP would likely not need to invest much in the future since all the tools for future maintenance would be owned."

If it's a fairly standard type of bottom bracket, it definitely makes sense to buy the tools. It might not be worth it if your bike has an obscure BB.  For example, a 20-tooth-spline BB (probably the most common) takes a tool that costs under $10 if you buy the generic one (find whatever has 4.something stars on Amazon). You'll probably need a crank puller, Park one is $15-20 (worth the splurge here, cheapos can destroy cranks or self-destruct).

bikewrench,3dhu9m,Wasd9595,6,Thu Jul 16 11:51:14 2015 UTC,"Just go through the full adjustment process again.  For some reason, every time I replace something it goes out of alignment again too.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j1gSwhsVN8 -- Rear derailleur adjustment  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxV_vKlgolc  -- Front derailleur adjustment"

bikewrench,3dhu9m,WarLorax,2,Fri Jul 17 01:13:47 2015 UTC,"If your derailleur is touching the spokes, that's usually because the derailleur is out of alignment. The two pulleys should be exactly underneath each other.  Before you try to do anything about derailleur alignment, look and see if you have a derailleur hanger. It is a piece of aluminum, usually silver or black, that attaches to the frame and your derailleur attaches to that. It is there so that if it snaps off, you're not out a whole frame. If you don't have one of those, and your derailleur is bolted directly on the frame, leave this for the LBS. They should have a special tool that will let them get more precise than bending it back in position by hand and is less likely to do major damage."
bikewrench,3dhu9m,actionlawyercomics,3,Thu Jul 16 13:45:13 2015 UTC,"Good advice, but let's make sure it's not a cold before recommending open heart surgery.  I'd say start by going through the normal Derailleur adjustment process... only think of the hanger if it doesn't work."
bikewrench,3dhu9m,Manezinho,2,Fri Jul 17 14:22:41 2015 UTC,"Usually replacing the rear cassette means re-adjusting the rear derailleur.  However, from your description I wonder if the derailleur hanger is bent or if the chain is long enough.  The chain being too short could explain why it's binding in the big/big configuration."
bikewrench,3dhu9m,mpbikeman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:11:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's possible you cut the chain too short or it didn't come with enough links for your gear range. Shifting into big-big with to short of a chain can also bend the derailleur hanger."
bikewrench,3dhu9m,otishotpie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:11:58 2015 UTC,"Sounds like your rear derailer needs a bit of fine tuning, there should be 2 small set screws on the derailer body, one screw stops it going past your biggest sprocket and the other screw stops the derailer moving past the smallest sprocket of the cassette when you select either gear.  Sounds like a similar situation for the front also, maybe the cable just needs a small adjustment so the derailer stops in the correct position when you change gears."
bikewrench,3dhu9m,BilboBagginsJr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:14:40 2015 UTC,I managed to make sure the derailleur dont touch the spokes. Now I can turn the pedals when in the big-big configuration but it is still really cranky. I haven't lubricated the drivetrain yet.   I think you might be right about the chain being too short. How to check this? I took these pictures of the drivetrain in the biggest sprocket and smallest.
bikewrench,3dhu9m,nukak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:51:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with what most people said regarding the limit screws of the derailleur. But just to rule out, is your chain long enough? I assume that it is ok having into consideration that you had the previous one to compare. But you know... shit happens. You can google how long should it be. It is not that difficult and doesnt take that much time."
bikewrench,3dhu9m,mpbikeman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:31:05 2015 UTC,Even checking against the previous chain isn't a foolproof solution.  That's assuming whoever installed it knew what they were doing.  Best bet is to check the chain against the configuration that's on there.
bikewrench,3dhu9m,BilboBagginsJr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:43:42 2015 UTC,"Yep, way too short.  The part of the derailer with the 2 cogs should be pointing straight down when on the biggest gear.... Just add a couple of inches of chain back onto it...."
bikewrench,3dhu9m,mpbikeman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:07:12 2015 UTC,"O.P. take a look at this tutorial and make sure your chain is long enough.  The big/big configuration looks borderline too short to me.  It can be tricky because too long though and it won't have enough tension in the small/small configuration.  What you want is to hit the sweet spot where it's almost too long but not quite.    Also, it looks like your derailleur hanger is bent.  Hard to tell for sure from the pics but you probably have to have it checked at a shop where they have a hanger alignment tool.  Your hanger is the replaceable kind so you could also just replace it with new."
bikewrench,3dhthi,Raumance,2,Thu Jul 16 11:41:28 2015 UTC,You can either get a new tubeless presta valve and re seal the tire with a little more stans or get a proper sized inner tube and clean out all the old fluid.

bikewrench,3dhthi,fiskfisk,3,Thu Jul 16 13:24:00 2015 UTC,Stan's Fluid is the brand name of the fluid you use in sealing tubeless tires.
bikewrench,3dhthi,blast_off,2,Thu Jul 16 13:47:51 2015 UTC,"If the air is leaking out at the base of the valve (where it meets the rim), remember that this is where any air that is leaking through the inner seal / rim tape usually leaks out. It can be a symptom of a leak in the rim tape or internally instead of actually around the vent.  Using a bit of petroleum jelly or something similar might also help to seal better between the rim and the inner part of the valve (the rubbery part), at least long enough to have the goo settle and seal instead."
bikewrench,3dhthi,blast_off,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:30:23 2015 UTC,Yes this is where the tire is leaking.
bikewrench,3dhthi,Nickerdos,2,Thu Jul 16 13:02:43 2015 UTC,"what kind of rim tape are you using, and what kind of presta valve did you get?"
bikewrench,3dhthi,stravadarius,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:53:24 2015 UTC,It's Kona Process 153 2015 and it has WTB ST i25 650b tires. I'm not sure what it has.  http://www.konaworld.com/process_153.cfm  does not say here
bikewrench,3dhthi,nhluhr,2,Thu Jul 16 13:01:55 2015 UTC,"oh... its oem.  Is the bike newish?  Take it back to the shop if you are not comfortable taking it apart.    If not, pull the tire off and find out why its leaking? You may just need to tighten the nut that holds the valve in place.  Watch out, as the valve may spin as you try and tighten it.  If it spins, put a thick towel between a pair of pliers (so you don't scratch the valve), and hold it in place."
bikewrench,3dhthi,nhluhr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:06:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I tightened the ring at the base of the valve that holds it in place and it lessened the leak by quite a lot but it's still leaking.
bikewrench,3dhthi,nhluhr,2,Thu Jul 16 13:18:14 2015 UTC,"Chances are the rim tape is not deigned for a tubeless setup.  You probably have a rim strip installed.    You will need to remove the rim strip. Clean the rim and install rim tape.  You start about 3 inches left of the valve hole and go all the way around and end 3 inches to the right of the valve hole.  Make sure you keep tension on the tape and it presses smoothly on the rim. Cut an X into the tape and press your valve stem through.   Stan's provides detailed instructions on how to do this as well.   Get your wheel nice clean, soap up your tire and try it again."
bikewrench,3dhthi,nhluhr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:12:34 2015 UTC,Ok thanks man.

bikewrench,3dhthi,nhluhr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:47:19 2015 UTC,I bought the bike a few months back I haven't done any stuff on it. I would hope that they know how to put in enough sealant in the Kona Factory.
bikewrench,3dhthi,stravadarius,2,Thu Jul 16 14:57:01 2015 UTC,Bikes don't come from the factory with sealant because sealant dries up over time.  As I see you already discovered it is not even tubeless yet.
bikewrench,3dhthi,nhluhr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:37:33 2015 UTC,How long does the sealant last?
bikewrench,3dhthi,stravadarius,2,Thu Jul 16 17:06:14 2015 UTC,"We tell people to clean out the old gummed up stuff once a year, with a 6 month refill in between to keep the liquid flowing and effective.  The sealant can be injected through the valve (with core removed) so it's pretty easy."
bikewrench,3dhthi,stravadarius,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:26:17 2015 UTC,I get a lot of pinch flats in my inner tubes. This was one wasn't but it was still  caused by an impact. Would you say tubeless is more resistant to those kinds of impacts that cause inner tubes snake bites?
bikewrench,3dhthi,stravadarius,2,Thu Jul 16 18:32:19 2015 UTC,Not having a tube will definitely reduce the chances of a pinch flat :)  You could still damage the sidewall or rim during an impact to the point where the tire loses seal but that would take a harder hit than a tube would take to be punctured.
bikewrench,3djkiu,BonBaiserDeDub,6,Thu Jul 16 20:04:26 2015 UTC,"They are friction shifters. By ""10 speed"", the seller means 2x5. Nice thing about friction shifters, however, is that they can shift pretty much whatever you like, so 2x6 or 3x7 should be no problem."
bikewrench,3djkiu,Skuggsja,3,Thu Jul 16 20:27:14 2015 UTC,What bike are you putting these on? As long as it doesn't have more than 9 cogs in the rear this should shift it just fine. These are old vintage friction shifters (i.e. non-indexed).
bikewrench,3djkiu,SgtBaxter,2,Thu Jul 16 21:05:14 2015 UTC,"Wow those are beautiful.  Definitely old enough to be friction (and usually indexed shifters also have a friction setting).  They should shift just about anything.  I'd recommend disassembling them and cleaning the washers (at a minimum) before using them.  Replacements don't exist to my knowledge, but you can make your own from various materials if the shift quality is poor."

I can't think of any reason why it would matter whether the AR washers are on the inside or the outside of the dropouts, and I can't find any source saying that it matters. Could you elaborate?

bikewrench,3dhb1o,yottamoto,13,Thu Jul 16 07:16:05 2015 UTC,"You check your tire pressure every 2 weeks on a bike you ride 25km to work every day? If you're trying to maintain a constant pressure you should be checking/adding air every few days at least. I add air, at minimum, before every other ride. It always needs topping off."

bikewrench,3dhb1o,ViaticalTree,2,Thu Jul 16 08:47:40 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on what you consider to be within an acceptable range. I think most regular/serious riders experiment with tire pressures and once they figure out what works best for them, they try to keep it right at that pressure. In two weeks of daily riding your tire will lose significant pressure."
bikewrench,3dhb1o,fantastipants,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:01:16 2015 UTC,"It also depends on your tubes.  Thin/light tubes lose air faster.  I've quiet often used Michelin Airstop, which are a little heavier, and lose air noticeably more slowly."

bikewrench,3dhb1o,w0ss4g3,5,Thu Jul 16 07:34:29 2015 UTC,That could absolutely be a factor. Newer bikes I looked at were all lighter by 5-9kg.
bikewrench,3dhb1o,fantastipants,12,Thu Jul 16 08:27:01 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's a big difference."
bikewrench,3dhb1o,SgtBaxter,4,Thu Jul 16 08:32:19 2015 UTC,"While 5-9kg doesn't make a huge difference to overall speed (since it's probably ~5% of your total weight bike+rider+bag), it makes a huge difference to the feeling of speed.  A light bike has much less momentum, so will 'surge' under you more when you push the pedals.  That makes it feel like it wants to go more.    Unless you actually have bad bearings - wheels or chaingear doesn't spin easily  - that probably does explain the difference you're feeling.  On the plus side, that 5% weight reduction only helps acceleration and climbing, by about that 5% - maintaining speed on the flat will be about the same."

On the other hand, if you purchased this bike from my shop and asked nicely, I would be more than willing to set a time (probably the slowest time of the week) to do a build.

Cheap bikes are the ones that have more issues and take more time.   105 and above bikes typically only need wheels, bars, pedals, and saddle installed. Headset adjustment is simple, and the bb won't need anything. Shifting and brakes are pretty damn close to perfect already. Seems that the longest time is spent unwrapping it.

A Trek hybrid will need the front wheel installed, seatpost inserted, and handlebars clamped in place (along with various quality controls like making sure the shifting is right, greasing things, truing the wheels, etc).

You'll need to know how to install a saddle and seatpost, as well as installing the wheels, handlebars, and pedals. Don't be surprised to find the tires and tubes already mounted, but you'll definitely need to check they're mounted correctly. Actually, anything already installed should be checked once over.  You'll probably have to run the brake cables and adjust the brakes as well. A multitool and a set of needlenose pliers (to crimp the brake cable endcap so your cable won't fray) will probably be all you need. That and a 15mm pedal wrench to attach the pedals.  If you get stuck, stop. Nothing should be forced on. If something feels wrong, go to a bike shop - there's no guarantee that something wasn't bumped or broken during shipping, or that the it even left the factory 100% correct. Other than that, in this age of youtube how-to videos, why not give it a try?"

I've assembled my bike (which was a fraction of the cost of the the Niner, I admit) out of the box. I referenced a few YouTube videos for clarification, and had to stop in at the the hardware store for a few tools (like allen wrenches), but for the most part it wasn't that complicated. You learn somewhere.   Also, I wouldn't doubt that the bike your buying comes some degree assembled. In my experience the bike was ""90%"" assembled. You can ask the company you buy it off of, or it lists it somewhere in the shipping section. For me, I had to put the handle bars on, the pedals on, the wheels into their dropouts, inflate the tires, check anything that might be loose, and then tune the derailleur."

Though a work stand would be useful you probably won't have access to one.  The tools you will need are a multi-tool (4mm, 5mm, and 6mm Allen keys and a screwdriver).  An adjustable crescent wrench will also be useful.  Also be sure to get some grease.  You will need to apply some on the threads of the pedals and to the seat tube (about an inch down), so your seat won't get stuck.  If it's a threaded headset than you should apply some grease to the head tube as well, before installing the stem.  I would recommend using youtube to learn how to set derailleur cable tension, adjust the limit screws, and set up the brakes properly.  After you finish everything, I would recommend taking it to the shop and just having them look through it, for your safety and to be sure that nothing is installed in a way that will cause damage.  The inspection should be free since you bought the bike there.  Best of luck, and have fun"
bikewrench,3dgnrc,kraftcrew,-1,Thu Jul 16 03:40:03 2015 UTC,Go for it! You might want to have the shop install the headset and bottom bracket. They've got the proper tools for the job.

Any bend on the fork? Is the fork cracked, especially if it's carbon? Is there damage on the bar tape? If so, the bars may have been bent and therefore cracked too- you should probably unwrap them and check.   Pretty much, just take a look at everything that might have been bent, tweaked, cracked, shattered, etc. and make sure it isn't.   And also yeah, take it to a bike shop for insurance purposes."

Taking it to a shop is the best idea, and it shouldn't cost you any money (though a six-pack would put you ahead of the game). A good shop would gladly take your bike overnight and give it a complete and thorough check, noting any issues that may have come from the accident--or otherwise. Ask for a written estimate on one of their service forms.   Some places may scoff at doing this for free, but a customer-oriented shop will know the value of the situation. They stand to gain a good customer in you; you're already riding your bike, you may need a new one, and you're standing there in the store asking for help. Ask them what would be a good replacement bike too.   Whether or not you actually follow through with the insurance is up to you."

The Schwalbe tires look good, but seeing as it's been a long time since we've ridden I'm trying to avoid spending a ton of money until I know we're going to ride consistently.  I'd hate to spend $200+ on new tires just for them to hang on the wall for a couple years unused.  I added those to Evernote so I can come back to them if I want to upgrade later though.  Thanks for the links and for confirming the sizes!"
bikewrench,3dgacb,Lakestang,2,Thu Jul 16 02:18:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about the tire you are looking at, but, Schwinn is not what it used to be. I have something like this on my old mountain bike, converted to road duty. Not exactly the same, as it has 26"" wheels. They ride decent and have way over 500 miles with no issues.   If you want to spend more on the tires, and it seems like money well spent to me if you plan to ride a lot, consider Schwalbe Tires  As far as tubes, you most likely need schrader valves, (like a car tire). I think 700 35-45, like the ""frequently bought together"" on Amazon suggests would be right. The other type of valve, Presta, is more narrow, so, the difference will be obvious.

bikewrench,3deotp,chuchurocka,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:04:42 2015 UTC,I think the key is the stuff they write about the range of allowed big sprocket teeth. For the 105 they seem to require 25 to 30 tooth whereas for Ultegra 23 to 30 tooth. So I would expect that they mean that a 11-23 Ultegra cassette is not recomnended for the 105 derailleur.  I cannot see how ut would be a problem either way though. Not sure why there would be a limit to how small the biggest sprocket on the cassette can be.

bikewrench,3deotp,chuchurocka,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:28:54 2015 UTC,"The issue is usually that if the biggest cogs are too small, there will be less chain wrap, which can lead to accelerated cassette wear.

bikewrench,3ddxi0,DrThoss,2,Wed Jul 15 14:50:42 2015 UTC,"Where did your spokes break?    -If the nipple broke, it would indicate the wheel was built with too short of a spoke length.  -If the spoke broke at the head (near the hub), it would indicate failure to bend spokes prior to tensioning to make them a straight-line and reduce cyclic stress during use.  -If the spoke broke at the threading, it indicates either improper left/right spoking (spoke holes are often offset or drilled at angles meant for left or right of wheel), excess stress (from using standard conical nipples (like basic DT 12mm) on a non-offset drilled rim instead of spherical ""DT Prohead"" or ""Sapim Polyax"" style to reduce lateral loading at the nipple-thread interface.  It could also potentially indicate some kind of damage to the threaded area which could result from not using something like Spoke Prep or Linseed Oil on the threads before building.  -If the actual rim bed cracked around the nipple, that indicates excessive spoke tension.  Solving this would be building with lower tension and/or using nipple washers to distribute the force across the rim bed.  On a radially laced front wheel that has no dish (as in, not a disc brake wheel), you are perfectly okay to leave the spoke tension well below rim maximum - like if your rim has a mfg-spec max tension of 120kgf (pretty common), you could built the front at 100 and never have any issues whatsoever since 1) front wheels that don't have disc brakes never receive any torque so there is very little dynamic loading/unloading of trailing/leading spokes and 2) wheels with no dish don't have a low-tension side (like a rear wheel that has NDS tension of closer to 50-60kgf where it gets problematic in terms of losing tension over time)."

bikewrench,3dbii6,KayceS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:43:26 2015 UTC,"Yep, CN-9000 and CN-6800 11spd chains have been replaced by CN-HG900, CN-HG700, and now the CN-HG600 (meant for 5800 105 group) which are indeed also meant for use on the M9000 and M8000 11spd MTB groups.  However, Shimano still has 7 basic chain categories that apply across the various product lines:   6,7,8spd HG and IG chains 9spd HG chains for MTB and Road 10spd HG-X chains for MTB and Trekking 10spd HG chains for Road 11spd HG-EV chains for MTB and Road 9/10 spd HG-X and HG chains for E-bike IHG/Singlespeed NX10 chains.   For Road and MTB groups still widely in use (9spd, 10spd, and 11spd), only the 10spd people have to actually pick different chains based on whether it's MTB or Road.  What makes an MTB chain different from a Road chain?  It's quite simply the shape of the side plates, both inner and outer.  The outer plates help with the ability to shift left to right when commanded and the inner plates assist with chain-retention when the chain is being pulled sideways a bit by cross-chaining or similar.  For example, Shimano engineers specifically recommend that if a person is using an 11Spd Road crankset with an otherwise 10spd road drivetrain, they should pick the 11spd chain to prevent unintentional chain derailing during use.  It will somewhat affect the shifting performance but the drawback isn't as severe as derailing accidentally like you'd be likely to do with the 10spd chain on an 11spd crank.

The method for adjustment is well documented online, one of the best sources I would guess as usual being Sheldon Brown's site.  It's a trial and error process where you get the feel for it, but the notion is that you kind of hand-tighten the cone down to the bearings, then let it off a bit onto an appropriately located locknut.  The friction of the cone-locknut-threads system keeps the cone in the correct location."
bikewrench,3dcqsu,illustribox,2,Wed Jul 15 07:18:01 2015 UTC,"This method works well, but I have a little trick to practice getting the feel for it... While working on a wheel, I do a ""jiggle and spin"" method. Start tightening everything down. Hold the wheel down, grab the axle and jiggle it. If you feel any wiggling/play, tighten it a little more. Once there's no play, spin the wheel while holding the axle. If it spins freely with no excessive grinding, that's the sweet spot. It might take a few tries to get the cups and cones tight with no axle play and a good spin, but you'll get the hang of it.  Keep in mind that you can get a slight amount of grinding to stop by backing the cone out against the lock nut without moving the lock nut at all."

Luckily they're pretty cheap and simple to replace if you have a big enough wrench. Basically, remove the pedals on both sides, remove the ball bearings on both sides (they'll come in a ring-shaped ""cage"" - don't lose any of the balls), remove the crank. Put bike aside and examine the crank: unscrew the cone that's tightly wedged against the chainrings (there should be two wrench flats for a very big wrench) and then the chainrings themselves.  Or go to a local bicycle coop and buy a used one-piece non-Schwinn crank. I bought one last week myself for an old Schwinn for $10, including chainrings, nuts, washers, and all.

Turns out, it's a weird ten speed specific hub, and the splines are taller than most other hubs both older and newer than this generation, which wound just require a spacer to make an old cassette fit. I had to have the entire free hub replaced.  Take a look at the splines on the hub.

How well do the rear brakes work and release?"
bikewrench,3dbmqa,AT_thruhiker,3,Wed Jul 15 00:35:46 2015 UTC,"When the freehub spins freely in both directions, it is because the pawls are not engaging the ratchet splines. Sometimes this is because of actual damage to the pawls, springs, or splines, but more often the cause is just too much grease/dirt in the pawls, or the grease in there has hardened.  Try opening up the freehub body. You won't actually need to remove the cassette from the body, though it makes it easier. Typically, a 10mm allen down the inside of the freehub (after the axle is removed) will allow you to remove the freehub, though some hubs dissasemble differently (and I've encountered some that seem completely resistant to being opened).  Be warned, sometimes the pawls will shoot out when the freehub body is removed, so keep your hand in a position to block them. Check visually and by feel, and degrease and clean all the appropriate bits (including pulling the springs out of the pawls if applicable, and cleaning out the holes for the springs). When you're ready to reassemble, apply a touch of grease to the part of the pawl that pivots, and a touch of grease around the ratchet splines. Really a tiny bit is all you need, to much and the grease makes the pawls 'float' over the ratchet.  For getting the freehub body back on, I suggest using a few wraps of dental floss around the pawls to hold them down, leave the free end of the floss hanging out. Once the pawls are partially in the body, unwind the floss and press the body on the rest of the way.  Of course, if your freehub body is in fact shot, replacing it isn't difficult, but finding the right one can be. Shimano ones are fairly interchangeable, they use a splined star to connect the entire freehub assembly to the hub itself. Certain brands are designed with freehub changes in mind, others you're better off replacing the hub or wheel."

Someone could key the info in wrong especially on older vintage parts.   http://www.wheelpro.co.uk/spokecalc/ Click on the help button, then under ""Hub dimensions A, B, C and D"" click on read this page, and follow the instructions.   I'm not a professional wheelbuilder but if the spoke isn't coming up to the end of the nipple where the slot is I would consider the spoke too short. Using a longer nipple might engage more threads but it doesn't make the spoke longer. I've ridden lots of wheels with short spokes so it doesn't mean it won't work but if you fully tension the wheel and find the spokes are still 2mm away from the end of the nipple then you would know your spokes are too short. Ideally I think the spokes should be long enough to penetrate the thickness of the inside section of the rim, obviously not so long as to protrude from the spoke nipple though."

bikewrench,3d92re,nhluhr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:58:07 2015 UTC,Of course nipples are meant to be in tension; the whole system is in tension. Spokes pull equally on the hub and the nipple which pulls on the rim.
bikewrench,3d92re,FalseBuddha,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:52:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry but that's not correct.  Diagram: http://i.imgur.com/fzCLUp7.png  With a spoke of correct length (threads engaged inside the head of the nipple), the head/shoulder of the nipple itself is in compression between the threads of the spoke and the rim bed.  This is important because whether you're using aluminum alloy or brass nipples, they both have a relatively small fraction of strength AND less than half the tensile modulus of the stainless steel that spokes are made of.  If you build a wheel with spokes too short to engage inside the head of the spoke, you are now subjecting the brass or aluminum nipples to tension - and since they are approximately half or less as stiff in tensile modulus, and somewhere on the order of 1/4 in terms of ultimate tensile strength, you now have a relatively weak wheel that will rapidly fracture nipples.  If you still can't figure this one out, here is a good reference complete with pictures.  http://www.kstoerz.com/freespoke/tech-threadengagement.php  And here's a quote from Sheldon Brown's website under Spoke Length ""If the spokes are too short, or seem to be:""   If a spoke does not extend into the head of the spoke nipple, then the weakest part of the spoke nipple is in tension and the nipple is at risk of breaking. Brass spoke nipples are much stronger than aluminum ones and are more likely to survive this abuse.   And finally, just google ""spoke nipple tension compression"" and you'll find countless other places it's discussed that having too short of a spoke mistakenly causes the nipple to be tensioned instead of compressed and therefore causes wheel failures."
bikewrench,3d92re,nhluhr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:21:11 2015 UTC,"What do you think about of opposite situation: spoke is threaded so far inside the nipple, that non-threaded part of the spoke is in the nipple threads.

This is bad because it means you could end up with not enough tension in the build and you no longer have the ability to dish or true the wheel except by reducing tension on one side (and if you try to true a wheel by only turning a spoke only one side, you cause roundness issues instead of just correcting the true."
bikewrench,3db2ev,thekev506,3,Tue Jul 14 22:01:24 2015 UTC,"Laquer-based urethane automotive paint is the best; with a small brush or stick it's usually possible to place a drop or two inside the chip and it tends to flow well to fill it, especially if you don't mix in too much reducer.  However, it's a pain to have to buy an entire pint of auto paint. Sometimes places carry 'touch-up pens' or small bottles of paint for the same purpose, but color selection is pretty limited.  The easier and almost-as-good method is to buy appropriately colored nail polish. It's technically not the same type of paint, but it blends well enough for a diy repair, and the color selection in a good store is pretty good."

bikewrench,3dazq2,happysnorlax,3,Tue Jul 14 21:42:23 2015 UTC,"clincher refers to the way the tire mounts to the rim, its defiantly the type you want, not tubular. As for size, almost any wheel described as a road wheel will take a 700x25c (its actually 700c X 25) tire. 700c is the ISO size for the diameter, the actual size is 622mm in diameter, it may have that in the discription. 25 is the width of the tire in mm, thats a typical size, so any rim thats discribed as 622x19 (or 622x17 or 622x15 or 622x20) or simular will fit. You will also want to make sure the hub width is right, your bike should take 130mm width, which again to standard, so most wheels will work, and make sure it has the right freebody hub, you most likely want shimano/sram compatible not campagnolo, shimano/sram again is standard. and as long as the description doesn't say disk wheel in it, rim brakes will work."

Since the weight of the crank arms and pedals are off center there will be wobbling when spun fast.

But the problem isn't necessarily the speed class. Its an engineering issue.  The  RD-M786 derailleur is designed using the Dyna-Sys shifting technology. The Dyna-sys system is engineered so that the shifters pull more cable but the derailleurs move less. This article is a great reference: http://blog.artscyclery.com/science-behind-the-magic/science-behind-the-magic-drivetrain-compatibility/   It isn't that you necessarily need a ""9 speed"" derailleur... it just has to have the correct actuation ratio to work properly with the amount of cable pull in your shifter. But, play it safe. Buy a 9 speed derailleur.  Maybe the RD-M771, or the low profile RD-M772... or anything that isn't Dyna-sys.   Good luck, I hope that helped."
bikewrench,3d7nr4,barnitosupreme69,4,Tue Jul 14 03:50:35 2015 UTC,"My guess is that you need more tension on the cable from the shifter to the derailleur. There is a barrel adjuster on the shifter that if you turn it puts more tension on the derailleur cable, which makes the derailleur move a little more to the outside (3th chainring).  Go to youtube and search for a tutorial on front derailleur adjustments, but don't touch the screws as they are most likely set up good."

A broken spoke makes the rest of the wheel suffer and could potentially lead to much more expensive repairs. A broken spoke shouldn't cost too much. Not getting it repaired can cost a lot more in the long term."
bikewrench,3d7nr4,Stickytapemeasure,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:14:38 2015 UTC,Would the wheel warping affect it? Because the spoke being broken led to the wheel becoming w0rped and untrue
bikewrench,3d7nr4,Stickytapemeasure,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:20:50 2015 UTC,"The wheel being untrue is a problem, but it shouldn't affect shifting at all.  The problem you have with shifting is likely that there is not enough tension on the cable. To get more tension on the cable, turn the adjuster at the shifter until it shifts to the 3th chainring.  A bent wheel has nothing to do with shifting."
bikewrench,3d7nr4,Stickytapemeasure,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:34:47 2015 UTC,"well, i suppose i'll let the guys at the shop take care of it since it's already in there. just kind of a bummer since i've only had the bike for less than 2 months and maybe 240  miles."

bikewrench,3d5zu0,grantrules,5,Mon Jul 13 21:29:01 2015 UTC,Would you believe that they had the gall to go out of business?
bikewrench,3d5zu0,grantrules,3,Mon Jul 13 21:30:16 2015 UTC,"Well that's unfortunate. Your plan sounds about like the best. You could try other carbon repair people, definitely some smaller shops have popped up in the last few years. Calfee is renowned, but I bet you could find someone else who would do it if you didn't feel like fucking with it yourself, although to me it sounds like a fun project."
bikewrench,3d5zu0,conipto,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:38:55 2015 UTC,"I'd probably run it buy a aero/astro engineer friend of mine who's done DIY carbon repair before. I feel like I know what needs to be done, but could royally screw up the details of execution.  Carbonframerepair.com just shot me down. Apparently they only work with pure carbon issues."
bikewrench,3d5zu0,conipto,3,Mon Jul 13 21:57:43 2015 UTC,"Calfee's way is pretty much how I'd do it, and I suspect most of them will say the same.  Are your inserts separate BB threads, and not a solid sleeve?  You might be able to get away with something like this:  http://www.cycle-frames.com/bicycle-frame-tubing/NOVA-7005-AL-BB-MTB-100mm-SHELL-THREADED.html  if you put a light coating of fiberglass around it before epoxying it in, then build up a little extra.  While it might seem scary, I'd say a BB repair is a very safe (as in not likely to kill you) repair to start with, especially on a fat bike.  At worst you might break it off under hard load if your repair fails.  A smaller thing like a seat stay crack or something, that's a little more risky.  I just did a PF30 (OSBB) repair on a frame that had stripped it out.. even that wasn't too hard, once I found the right reamer."
bikewrench,3d5zu0,cleansoap,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:09:18 2015 UTC,"PS - The important part there is also the ""coat with fiberglass"" part.  You don't want to epoxy raw uncoated aluminum to carbon, it'll corrode over time and weaken."

Anyways, yes, afaict, it's two inserts on each side, which I imagine is what led to this problem in the first place."

bikewrench,3d5qsm,Elliott_0,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:55:44 2015 UTC,Via the barrel adjusters. I've a few years of basic maintenance under my belt.
bikewrench,3d5qsm,Skuggsja,3,Mon Jul 13 20:06:14 2015 UTC,"Cool, in that case I'd try: Settting it up with the barrel adjuster all the way screwed in. Pull the cable taught but not too tight (i.e. just the weight of your arm, not actually pulling on it) before screwing it in. If the adjustment doesn't then come from quarter turn adjustments then we can rule out tension as the cause. Things I'd then look for are a bent cage or hanger/stay.

bikewrench,3d6bve,ausstieglinks,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:33:56 2015 UTC,"I can address a couple of things. Not all of them, but:   The model. It is entirely possible that SRAM has yet to update their website. Go to a dealer that has good stock/works with mountain bikes and ask if they can order a TK Solo Air Recon Gold in 27.5"", and they will almost certainly be able to get it from a distributor. Most of the other models around the Recon's price are listed as having 27.5 options. I don't think it should hurt your fingers, but the red knob has an allen key on the end of it. That's what acutally drives the rebound adjustment socket, which is why you have to push it in. When you get a chance to, flip the bike upside down, pull the rebound knob out and see if the socket is damaged or dirty. Damper damage is possible. Oil may also have leaked into the lower half of the leg (where there is some oil for lubrication). This is something I would recommend professional work for, unless you have helpful friends and some dedicated tools and the appropriate suspension oil."
bikewrench,3d6bve,llama_herder,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:02:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  If it comes to it, I guess I'll do that!  I'll check if I can remove the red thing.  I guess my question there is whether my experience is normal... is it normal for that adjuster thing to not be smooth and hard to use?  Too bad, I like doing work on my stuff by myself.  Is there a safety check that I could do to make sure that it's safe to ride?  Should I go to a professional shop do that?"
bikewrench,3d6bve,llama_herder,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:51:16 2015 UTC,"I can't really say to the difficulty of adjusting RS rebound knobs.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you only have to go to a shop. SRAM does have detailed service manuals for fork service.

bikewrench,3d4mn0,_Ymodos_,2,Mon Jul 13 14:41:09 2015 UTC,"Okay, follow-up question on a somewhat related topic, then: my shifter cable snapped inside my sora 9-speed rear shifter. The ends of the cable ended up fraying, and now this stupid bit of cable is all in my shifter's business and it won't let me shift down far enough to pull it out.  How can I get that damn thing out of there?  I've already replaced the shifters with 105 10-speeds (I'd already been planning to  upgrade that weekend anyways--already had all the parts and everything), but I'm thinking of buying another frame--maybe a cheaper steel frame if I can get one--and using the sora gear as a  backup / bad weather bike."
bikewrench,3d4mn0,atlasMuutaras,2,Mon Jul 13 18:49:12 2015 UTC,"That's fixable then, but not easy, depending on where exactly the piece of cable has ended up.

bikewrench,3d4mn0,_Ymodos_,5,Mon Jul 13 14:43:07 2015 UTC,You can probably find a 9-speed Tiagra (4500 series) shifter on eBay at a reasonable price.  Just make sure you get the triple version (ST-4503 I think).
bikewrench,3d4mn0,tmwk,2,Mon Jul 13 15:34:32 2015 UTC,I would try to get used Tiagra despite the cheesy gear indicators. You only need to replace the shifter that actually broke.  Be aware that current Tiagra is 10-speed so you'd need tp find a used 9-speed shifter if that is the one that broke.

bikewrench,3d4mn0,Synthacon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:32:46 2015 UTC,This is the answer I was afraid I'd get. Thanks though.
bikewrench,3d4fij,sheep_puncher,3,Mon Jul 13 13:06:00 2015 UTC,Well... You might try degreasing it and trying to clean the chain thoroughly before lubing.  But if you haven't given your chain any attention in years I'd bet it and likely the rear sprockets are worn past their useful life.  Getting everything nice and clean and well lubed may make problems more apparent.  Take your bike into an LBS and ask them to measure the chain stretch.  If it's worn replace the chain (and the sprockets if there is substantial wear).  Then try to take care of your new chain.  A well-maintained drive train lasts much longer than a neglected one.  How long do you think a car would survive if you never changed the oil?
bikewrench,3d4fij,SavingHawaii,2,Mon Jul 13 13:13:16 2015 UTC,The bike has been abused and neglected for most of its life. If I start replacing parts It's most likely better to write it off completely and take better care of the next one.   If degreasing cleaning and lubing the chain will help I'll do that and at least a replacement decision will be better informed. Thanks for the advice.
bikewrench,3d4fij,ThanMan,3,Mon Jul 13 13:34:53 2015 UTC,"At this stage, just put some new or used motor oil on it and wipe it off so it's not flinging all over everything when you pedal."
bikewrench,3d4fij,_Ymodos_,2,Mon Jul 13 16:54:26 2015 UTC,"If you have never lubricated the chain (or cleaned it) there is probably not much point to do anything as the bike most likely runs like shit anyway.  However, if you want to go over it with the least expenses possible I would just spray it liberally with WD-40 while running the cranks backwards. Then wipe off all of the crud by holding a rag around the chain while turning the cranks backwards. Repeat as necessary.  Once you get the chain relatively clean, apply any generic chain lubricant and you'll be good to go. But don't think that the chain really plays a big role in slowing you down, with a completely unmaintained bike pretty much everything will slow you down."

bikewrench,3d4fij,bikejockey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:36:12 2015 UTC,"got the chain looked at and it is indeed fucked to shit. It's more stretched than the tool can measure and it has a twist in in, it sits sloped. I'm looking at replacing the chain and sprockets entirely."
bikewrench,3d4fij,FranklinChainsaw,3,Mon Jul 13 19:22:28 2015 UTC,"Probably the chainrings too then.  Those tend to wear out slowest but with the chain that far gone they're probably due.  The problem here is that a worn chain will cause a lot of wear on anything it touches.  Those rings and cogs get worn.  If you just put on a new chain and don't replace them as well, they'll rapidly wear out your new chain (and cause horrible skipping in the meanwhile).  This is pretty easy stuff to DIY if you're interested.  You won't save a ton of money this time as the tools cost about as much as shop labor, but next time you'll have the tools and can just do the parts.  You will have to do some research to make sure you're getting the right parts."

The screw driver style is perfect for hard to reach bolts,  and no risk of scratching a frame with the opposite end of the key.   The l-handle for everything else.

If you need something else, it's a weird size.   I would stay away from PH-1 for hex, but the same style torx come in very handy because they are pretty much only used on brake calipers and levers where you need the extra leverage and have plenty of space."
bikewrench,3d2yz9,conipto,3,Mon Jul 13 03:47:33 2015 UTC,"A really high quality set of allen wrenches is worth spending some money on.  The reason why is that worn out tools make worn out bolts.  Stripping things out on your expensive (often aluminum) bolts will get you down pretty quick.  To that end, I absolutely love PB-Swiss' sets.  They're not cheap, but I've had sets I used for 6-7 years (and as my most used tool when I was working as a repair guy for a non-bike job as well).    http://www.amazon.com/PB-Swiss-212LH-10-Piece-Chrome/dp/B001EQADTC/ref=pd_sim_60_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=0ZXS3T9GVE4F561G9QTV  This is my favorite set up.  L key with ball end, long shaft.  The L end is flat, the long end ball - since you don't want to be applying torque anyway with the ball ends, that ends up working out well.  You have the ball end to spin things in, and the L end to tighten.  Whatever you buy (I realize I pasted a link to a pretty expensive set but - they are built really, really well like I said) avoid anything with a ""gripper"" end on the ball.  These so rarely actually help and just start stripping things faster and then the dumb metal clips fall off anyway."

You're fine, you don't need to swap them out for something wider.  If you want nicer tire's I'll second /u/arvi1000 's suggestion to pick up some 32c Panaracer Paselas.  They'll look quite nice on that bike.  If you want something with more protection against punctures the T-Serv is nice but don't have the gumwalls like the Paselas."

If you have fenders and go bigger you'll be constantly adjusting them from dragging, and I don't find the difference between 32 and 35/37 to be that big.  Anyways, for non-clip in pedals I really like the MKS Grip King. Big ole grippy platform pedal that's very well made."

Depends on your ambitions and your willingness to invest in a special pair of shoes.  My problem with ""normal"" pedals is that they tend to hurt my shins a lot when I inevitably slip off. So I'm not really in a position to recommend a type of platform pedals, but I know there are some people that like them. Maybe try asking in /r/bikecommuting.  I definitely approve of changing the pedals, stock pedals are probably crap."

If its made in Japan I guess it will be BSA threaded if in Italy then you probably it will be ITA.  Easiest way to check if there are no labels or markings. Take the english threaded BB and try to to put it in without screwing it. If BB slots in means you have a ITA BB. If it's tight and you need screwing - then its correct english BB.

bikewrench,3d35ka,shadowman42,3,Mon Jul 13 03:45:22 2015 UTC,"If your rim is out of round or out of true, you need to have your wheels trued (a mechanic would adjust the spokes to do this).  A loose hub is unlikely to be the cause of a once-per-revolution bump.  If your rim has a spot where it's bent outward (like when hitting a bump on underinflated tires), you will need to have your rim repaired or replaced at a shop. Aluminum, which your rims are likely made of, is susceptible to failure after being bent back and forth. $75 or so for a replacement wheel is, in my estimation, a better deal than spending time recovering from an accident."
bikewrench,3d35ka,ActuallyAHamster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:19:39 2015 UTC,"By my research, a loose hub would be indicated by play in the wheel right? That was gone after I took it to the shop"

bikewrench,3d35ka,singlejeff,3,Mon Jul 13 15:55:33 2015 UTC,"There is a chance that the bead is not seated evenly around the rim. I had that happen on a BMX and had quite a pogo effect on the front.  You can look around the tire where it meets the rim. There is usually a mold line close to the rim that makes it easy to see if it's even. Check both sides just to be sure.  Alternatively, pick up the rear of the bike and spin the wheel to see if you notice the bulge. Once you find an uneven spot take a closer look at the wheel/rim/tire at that location."
bikewrench,3d35ka,bikejockey,2,Mon Jul 13 05:15:02 2015 UTC,"turn your bike upside down. spin the wheel, look at it in relation to your stationary brakes. this is a makeshift truing stand. if your rim appears to get closer and further from the brake pad at one spot, you have an out of true rim.  next look at the height. if the rim appears to move up (or down) in relation to the brake pad you have a hop.  for either of these situations you could learn about truing the wheel, but a shop may be quicker and cheaper for now and bear responsibility for the repair without getting spoke tensions out of whack in relation to each other.  if you ride an underpressure tire, the rim is vulnerable to damage - like riding a car with a flat tire. on the best of circumstances you should be riding to avoid road debris and obstacles and potholes, be especially vigilant with underinflated tires."

bikewrench,3d2wbq,pthu,2,Mon Jul 13 21:26:51 2015 UTC,"That's not just stripped - that pedal was loose for a long time, letting it damage the face of the crankarm as well. There are no threads left to tap and the damage is not perpendicular, making a helicoil repair difficult or impossible. It looks like you'll need a new crankset; it's up to you and your bike mechanic to determine what quality (and price) of your replacement crankset.   For the future, be on the lookout for loose or worn parts. Had the pedal fallen off at the wrong time (e.g. pedaling hard through an intersection), this could have become a serious accident. Besides, what could have been a free courtesy service (tighten up a loose pedal) will now cost you money in parts + labor."

bikewrench,3d2ipn,Oliver1307,5,Mon Jul 13 00:24:47 2015 UTC,First thing I would check is to make sure the wheel is in the dropouts all the way. Loosen up the bolts or quick release while the bike is on the ground and if it isn't in all the way the wheel will become straight. That is probably the issue. If not then the dish is off. The dish is where the rim is in relation to the hub/axle. Your LBS should be able to redish it. It might cost a few bucks though.
bikewrench,3d2ipn,bizzileb1tch,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:54:56 2015 UTC,"I went back where I bought it. The guy apparently fixed it but, to me, it seems just as off centered as before.

Even if you use rim brakes, they can be adjusted to suit that small of an offset in dish.  If you get into technical stuff, if it's offset toward the drive side, that would change spoke tensioning ratios and what-not, but unless things were on the ragged edge anyway, I don't think that a few millimeters would make enough difference to worry about."
bikewrench,3d2ipn,FokTheRock,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:36:58 2015 UTC,It might be the axle is not centered and must be adjusted.
bikewrench,3d2avg,TheSilverBanger,4,Sun Jul 12 23:17:03 2015 UTC,"The catalogue indicates that 1978 Le Tours had round reflectors on the wheels, whereas mine has rectangles.   The plastic on wheel reflectors becomes brittle and they often break off. Would be very rare to see originals on a 35 year old bike.   have not had much success in locating vintage Schwinn Le Tour parts online.   Bikes aren't like cars, they are much more standardised - specific ""Schwinn Le Tour parts"" don't exist. Any standard front quick release skewer should work with your bike. You don't have to get a special Schwinn part. Schwinn most likely wouldn't have made the QR skewer anyway and it would be 'Schwinn Approved', which means whatever supplier Schwinn could get it cheapest for for that batch of bikes.  Until the last 25 years or so, pretty much all QR skewers looked similar to the standard Campagnolo design, any skewer that is that sort of design no one will notice if it doesn't match the rear/isn't original unless they bend down and look at it closely. Or buy a matching F+R pair of that kind of design.   Mostly I just want to find the correct part so I can ride the bike.   If you plan to ride this bike, can I suggest:   Replace those tires (and inner tubes)! They would be extremely dangerous to ride on if they don't explode when you try to pump them to the correct pressure.  Raise the seat - at the moment the bike looks way too big for you. If you need the seat that low I think you will find this bike an unpleasantly long stretch to reach the handlebars, and will run into difficulties/crash if you ever need to put your feet on the ground on uneven terrain or while moving  (as there is no standover height). Google some guides on getting the correct seat height, hopefully you need to raise it at least 2-3 inches The aftermarket handllebars that have been fitted are very poorly adjusted in terms of the angle of the brake levers - it looks like to try and cope with the bike being too big for the previous owner. The bar tape is also old and fucked and won't be nice to ride with, especially if you don't have cycling gloves. Take off the old bar tape, adjust the brake levers down on the bars about an inch and put new bar tape on.   Also I should say that while this bike is vintage, it's not valuable or collectible vintage like Schwinn's higher end Paramount range of that era is, so in terms of monetary value there's little point in spending tons to stay authentic. The bike is only worth around $80-120 fixed up so it's a little debatable whether fixing an old 30lb ten speed is worth it unless it has sentimental value to you (considering it needs tires + tubes, bar tape and the skewer at least). If I came across this bike I would probably donate it to my local cycle co-op that fixes bikes with donated parts and gives them to families/people in need"

bikewrench,3d0u0l,bikejockey,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:44:33 2015 UTC,a derailleur hanger is a replaceable commodity but for some reason isn't standardized. if you post the make and model number of the bike you might be able to get pointers in finding a compatible hanger.
bikewrench,3d0u0l,cleansoap,2,Mon Jul 13 02:01:04 2015 UTC,"Photos would help.    Bending the derailleur is possibly enough, replacement is possibly warranted, and the derailleur hanger itself should be inspected.  Unless there is damage you're not describing (such as a cut, kink, or fray), I'm not sure what replacing the cable would accomplish.  Photos looking rear to front parallel to the centerline of the bike would be ideal, maybe one perpendicular one to see the ""big picture"".  Photos from further away which are well lit and in focus are more valuable than photos taken closer than the minimal focus distance of your camera/lens."
bikewrench,3d0u0l,bizzileb1tch,2,Sun Jul 12 16:04:18 2015 UTC,"Your LBS should be able to bend the hanger back. There is a tool made specifically for this. However, there is a chance that it snaps when they bend it back, just keep that in mind. This is if it's the hanger of course."
bikewrench,3d0u0l,chibuezephoibos,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:25:48 2015 UTC,"Just replace the hanger. The cable has nothing to do with this, that just determines tension on the derailleur when shifting to move it up or down the cassette. Also, depending on how bad the crash was you may have done some damage to the derailleur itself, so that may need replacement as well. Give it to your local LBS, and ask them if they can look at the derailleur and check that nothing on the inside is messed up, if the outer casing isnt bent anywhere, and if the limit adjusting mechanism is still in tact."
bikewrench,3d1420,foreverfaithful49,3,Sun Jul 12 17:27:28 2015 UTC,I am of the opinion that if you love your frame/ geometry it is worth upgrading if you're not stoked on the frame then wait. As for wheels a good wheel set will cost at least half the cost of a new bike but are always worth it as they can be transfered to a new bike and a second wheelset is just nice to have
bikewrench,3d1420,What_a_rubbish_user,2,Sun Jul 12 17:47:07 2015 UTC,"Is anything broken? Are you very dissatisfied with some specific part?  definitely replace any smaller bits you don't like. That just makes riding much better. If shifting got clunky, replace cables and housing.  Road bikes are evolving very quickly these days. After a couple years electronics + hydro, thru axles and advanced carbon and/or quality steel will be a norm. I'd ride what you got till those significant upgrades come down to your budget. Unless smth is broken or you don't like, of course. But don't upgrade just for the sake of upgrading."

bikewrench,3d06mc,mpbikeman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:47:21 2015 UTC,"Hard to say for sure if this is the culprit based on the description.  But they should have checked derailleur alignment at the shop (source: used to be a bike mechanic).  O.P. what are the symptoms of the indexing or better yet what have you tried? Could be anything from improper adjustment, bent hanger, worn chain and cassette,  loose derailleur cable, or faulty shifter.  If I were diagnosing I'd start with checking obvious things first like chain and cassette wear, cable tension, and eye-ball the rear derailleur hanger to see if it's obviously bent or the if the derailleur is damaged.  If you turn up nothing there Sheldon Brown has an article on derailleurs and his stuff is pretty much the bible on all things bike related.  It's usually my first go-to when I need to check something.    If your still stumped I'd take it in again to have a professional look at it."

When I corner on my MTB sometimes the brakes will rub. I would try setting up the brakes again following the manufatures recommended procedure and if the issue is still there it may be worth taking your bike to your LBS
bikewrench,3czmib,PM_ME_YOUR_BlCYCLE,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:25:27 2015 UTC,"Hm, I'm not entirely sure.  There's too much wind in my ears to tell when it's rubbing.  I should set up my camera and lavalier microphone down there.  Edit: seriously thinking of taking everything apart and reinstalling."
bikewrench,3czmib,PM_ME_YOUR_BlCYCLE,2,Tue Jul 14 15:21:05 2015 UTC,"its probably not necessary to reinstall everything. Just loosen up the brake, take the cable off and proceed from there using the manufactures instructions. There are lots of videos on youtube about installing bb7 brakes too."
bikewrench,3czmib,PM_ME_YOUR_BlCYCLE,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:22:59 2015 UTC,"When I drop the front end lightly onto the ground, the rubbing begins.   That sounds to me like your wheel is not all the way in it's dropout. Does your bike have quick release skewers, nut/bolt design, or a thru-axle?  Here's what I would check:   Remove the wheel and place it back in the dropouts while the bike is on the ground, ensuring that the wheel is indeed correctly aligned in the dropouts. Tighten the caliper screws that secure the caliper to the fork and ensure that they are not  impacts. BB7s have adjustments on the side that can be done with a T25.  (See the shiny bolt on the large red circle on the left caliper here).  Tightening the bolt bring the inside pad closer to the rotor and loosening it pulls the inside pad away from the rotor. I recommend following the process described in this video to maybe remedy some of your issues."
bikewrench,3czmib,nhluhr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:50:02 2015 UTC,"It's actually as far into the drop out as possible.  I've tried leaning over the handlebars while pulling the front wheel upwards and tightening.  I do know about both the outer and inner adjustment knobs as well.  I think I might have to take the brake apart when I have to find the issue, and while I'm at it, I'll probably spread the spring a bit more."
bikewrench,3czmib,Drone9,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:54:57 2015 UTC,Gotcha. There's also a small tension adjustment screw on the underside of the outboard side of the caliper you might be able to adjust in that case.
bikewrench,3cygzn,The-Alpine,2,Sat Jul 11 22:42:10 2015 UTC,"Headset might be loose, or you might need to service it. If your bike has a rigid fork, you can squeeze the front brake and try to move the bike forward/backward when it's stopped and on the ground. You will feel/hear movement if the headset is loose. If it's a suspension fork, you just have to grab the fork and shake it to see if there is movement (or lock out the fork)."

bikewrench,3cydai,stoleyourwaifu,2,Sat Jul 11 22:09:01 2015 UTC,"Step one is try to get it right just by adjusting the other screw--all that matters is that there's enough tension for the brake to spring back and that it's balanced on both arms. Make small turns then squeeze and release the brake before checking.  However, if that doesn't work, you can loosen the bolt that holds the entire brake arm on the frame, and there's a little tiny pin that fits in one of three holes. If it's on the bottom or middle hole, you can move that pin higher up to increase the amount of tension on that side (or lower it to decrease). Just pull the brake partway off, then turn it and slot the pin in the new hole and tighten it up  There's a chance the part that the tension screw sits against is broken, in which case the brake is toast. The same can happen if the plastic that surrounds the screw is cracked enough."
bikewrench,3cydai,DrEnormous,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:10:27 2015 UTC,"What does the other side look like? It looks like the screw can't reach far enough, as if something got broken. Can't tell for sure though."
bikewrench,3cydai,onseali,2,Sat Jul 11 22:23:25 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/1uGimq8  That's the other side. And yeah after moving it around a bit it can't reach. But I'm really wondering if that actually controls the brake spring tension after all
bikewrench,3cydai,onseali,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:49:38 2015 UTC,What is the model of the brakes? The tension screw is usually very tiny.

My 2cents: You really only need a spoke wrench, and maybe the cassette/freewheel tool if it's on that side of the rear wheel.  If you have rim brakes you have a truing stand.  Put the wheel in the bike after you replace the spoke and put some tension on it.  Wrap something around the brake lever to set the pads close to the rim and go for it.  Unless the wheel is totally bent or has broken many spokes it's not super hard.  It's the kind of thing you can do on the side of the road just like fixing a flat.  Edit: Also find a new shop if possible, $35 for a spoke is up there.  The most I've ever seen is $20, usually more like $10-15."
bikewrench,3cy9lc,umaijcp,2,Sun Jul 12 05:43:24 2015 UTC,"This.  I have replaced many spokes and trued many wheels using my bike to hold the  wheel, my fingernail to gauge deflection, and a squeeze of two spokes to measure tension.  Yes, this takes some experience, but you are only replacing one or two spokes so you have a whole bunch of other spokes to compare tension so I think anyone that can read a dial gauge can do the job without one. Just go slow and if you start messing up you can pay the $35 to get the wheel trued."

bikewrench,3cy9lc,jondthompson,2,Sun Jul 12 16:47:21 2015 UTC,"When replacing spokes, you almost always have to go over all the other spokes and tension several of them until the wheel is round, true and spokes have even tension and no wind-up. It's not ""charging $35 for changing ONE spoke""."

Loosen it until you can whack the bars and have them come loose (but do not just keep loosening or you will make a lot of work for yourself), then slide the whole stem and handlebars up, line up the bars with the wheel, and tighten it back down.  But you're likely going to run into one or both problems:   That stem looks pretty far out already. There's a maximum amount it can safely be pulled out (should be marked on there). It may not have a lot more to go. Some of the cables do not appear have a lot of slack, so you might have to redo the cables and housing to move it up more than a slight bit.

Giant road bikes of a certain vintage used the original Overdrive, which was 1.25 to 1.125, in which case you just need a new lower headset assembly. Most modern high-end bikes, including many Giants, have a taper that goes from 1.5 to 1.125, if you have this you'll need a replacement lower headset assembly OR just a 1.5 to 1.125 reducer race for your headset.

bikewrench,3cttzr,Drone9,8,Fri Jul 10 18:51:48 2015 UTC,"Avid bb7 brakes have pad adjuster wheels to fine tune pad spacing. You shouldn't need to use the lever's barrel adjuster. Examine your cable and housing - make sure housing ends are in place properly. Don't preload the moving brake arm too much by clamping the cable under too much tension. Check that all bolts are tight. Set the inboard pad as close as possible without rubbing on the rotor, I usually move the pad until it starts to rub, then back it out 1/4 turn. The outboard, moving pad should be set the same way. Sometimes this requires truing the rotor to get everything as close as possible. And bed in the pads, like u/D0rk4L mentioned."

To adjust the moving pad, I unscrew the barrel adjuster on the lever by a few turns, move the arm on the caliper until the pad touches the disc, tighten the cable in that position, and then screw the barrel adjuster all the way back in.

bikewrench,3cttzr,D0rk4L,4,Sat Jul 11 08:26:22 2015 UTC,You need to bed in the pads/rotor. Do 10 hard stops from 15ish MPH and that should help wear some pad material onto the rotor. Fresh pads/rotors always need bedding in.

bikewrench,3cslgg,H4ukka,3,Fri Jul 10 13:27:24 2015 UTC,"That's always the safest option. If you are unsure don't ride it.  The pinch bolts are on the non-drive side crank - two opposing bolts. The safety pin is located in a slot between the pinch bolts. Removing the crankarm is as easy as undoing both of the bolts, pulling out the safety pin (tab) and taking the crankarm off. You only need is 6mm allen key and a tool to remove the cap - the cap is only finger tight (0.7 - 1.5 Nm) so it can be removed with a pair of pliers haha. I used a pair of pliers before I bought the actual tool.   Here is a pdf from Shimano showing the general assembly of a Hollowtech II crankset, it also has the recommended torques."

bikewrench,3cslgg,H4ukka,2,Fri Jul 10 14:07:44 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly sure nothing is actually broken, there is just some extra wiggle room because the non-drive side crank isn't quite fully in. The axle is fused into the chainset on the drive side; so that really can't come loose. And if the cranks are solid otherwise - i.e. no play up/down, front/back - the bottom bracket is fine. Stickytapemeasure gave a good and short explanation on how to tighten it easily. ^^ But your local shop will get everything sorted if you don't want to play with it yourself; although it would be good to know how to do it so in the future you can do it yourself."

Kinda hard to explain... Does this video help? While wiggling like that the drive side moves as well (crank + chainrings) Nothing else seems to be moving (silver part of the bb for example)"
bikewrench,3cslgg,redfoxiii,2,Fri Jul 10 14:56:37 2015 UTC,"The cranks should be solid with no play in any direction. If there is play when you pull the cranks up or push them down that might mean your bottom bracket bearings have some wear on them. How old is that bike, more precisely the bottom bracket? How many much distance do you have on it? If the bearings are worn you might need to replace the bottom bracket; unless you want to try to service the bearing but I'd leave that to the graybeards.   Bottom brackets aren't that pricey, $20 or so. But replacing it does require a specific Hollowtech II BB tool (Shimano loves their special tools!).  Here is an easy to follow video on replacing a HWII BB. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZNJM1Hi7jc"

Sorry about the confusion...really tough to communicate in english about technical stuff I have no experience with :D Did the video help?"
bikewrench,3cslgg,Stickytapemeasure,2,Fri Jul 10 15:33:50 2015 UTC,I just thought the non-drive side crank wasn't in fully so there was sideways play. Yes the video was helpful in clarifying what the issue is.  If that's the original BB then I think it's a wear issue.  You can remove the chainset (cranks + chainrings) easily yourself to check the bearings by hand. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRBrmQmFDuY.   You can remove the cap with a pair of needle-nosed pliers since you probably don't have the tool for it.  The bearings should feel smooth and rotate easily. It's really easy to tell when you're rotating it with your finger. If it feels rough or doesn't want to turn at all then that's a clear indication of worn bearings.   Easiest option as always is to take your bike to a shop but cost the most in the end. Or a co-op if you have one of those nearby.

bikewrench,3csq38,vagittarius,4,Fri Jul 10 13:47:06 2015 UTC,"9 speed freewheels are a relatively recent innovation, created for use on electric bikes with oversize axles. Back in the day when thread-on freewheels were the norm, 8 speed freewheels were a thing for about 10 minutes. They didn't catch on because with thread on hubs, the rear hub bearings are on the far left (non-drive side) and close to the middle, under the freewheel threads (drive side), and the wider the freewheel got, the more off-center the drive-side bearing is, and the weaker the axle becomes. Cassette hubs solved this by putting bearings as far out as possible on the drive and non-drive sides.  You could respace your hub, spread your frame, and put on a 9-speed freewheel, but it would result in a very week wheel."
bikewrench,3csq38,dokydoky,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:01:26 2015 UTC,I see.  It sounds like a better option is to replace the wheel with one that uses a freehub and get a cassette. Do you think it would be okay to spread my frame? I suppose I can google that.

bikewrench,3cq44w,ysengrimus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:16:54 2015 UTC,You think something more like a 60mm technomic might be more appropriate in this case then?  50mm seems a little extreme. Guess I should spend more time with the calculator.
bikewrench,3cq44w,bikejockey,3,Fri Jul 10 02:42:26 2015 UTC,"this is quill stem. the nice part about modern thread less stems is being able to swap out stems easily. there are mountain bikers who use zero reach stems for example.  I use a small stem (70mm) but that's a consequence of a modern bike that didn't fit(56 cm vs a 52 I usually ride), typically modern stems are 100 - 110mm. in observing older stems the trend was smaller reach, the rationale I'm not sure about. I suspect the forks were raked more to compensate.  it's totally possible going small reach, but results in a twitchier ride. the thing is, going 2cm smaller might not alleviate her stretched out feeling, and then you will have done a lot of work and still not quite right, and have a twitchy ride. Is her saddle as far forward, that's a stop gap as well.  just my thoughts, good luck.   further reading is stack and reach, I believe slow twitch goes into detail. basically as long as the contact points, angles of body are preserved, you can make different frame geometry fit. compromises are handling as I mentioned.  edit: on thinking about it, can you raise her stem, thereby less of a racing posture in the drops. might help for free. otherwise depending on the quill you got to remove bar tape, shifter and brake levers, to install new stem if it didn't have a removable face plate.."
bikewrench,3cq44w,bikejockey,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:51:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah it can raise some but not enough.

After indeed making sure you have the correct size post, this is the next step. The abrasive in the paste is typically made from walnut shells, so it won't damage the steel or aluminum.   But, first make sure the frame isn't torqued to the point where the two pieces the binder bolt run through are touching. As in; you've got the bolt that pinches the frame and holds the seat post, now make sure there's still a slit in the seat tube, and a gap in the seat tube under the binder bolt. If not, then you're just folding the frame around the seat post.   If it is touching, or there isn't much of a gap, then you need to remove the post, stretch out that slit, and put the next size up seatpost in. You may need to use an expandable reamer to get the next post to fit."
bikewrench,3coh80,Bathorhythm,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:13:22 2015 UTC,"Good to know. There's still a gap there, and the seatpost is the right size for the frame.

bikewrench,3coh80,velvet7,2,Thu Jul 9 16:11:30 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about it breaking, you can inspect the bolt. The bolts will actually stretch a little before breaking, and the difference in thread pitch and the thickness of the bolt (by the head) can be easily seen. The threads will be spaced out further, and the diameter of the bolt by the head will be thinner.   Checking this will also give you an idea if the holes for the bolt are worn, which may allow for the bolt to creep and lose tension in the frame. Hopefully the key-hole shape (which corresponds with the key tab on the ""nut"" side of the binder bolt) on the (usually) non-drive side is there still."

To be honest, unless the current derailleurs/shifters are actually broken, I don't think this is a worthwhile use of your time and money. The improvements will be marginal at best - you would be better putting the funds towards a better bike second hand that is better in every respect, not just the derailleurs. As you have obviously found, you get what you pay for with bikes. You could buy a similar but better quality bike on Craigslist for $150-200, so $35 on new derailleurs where you might not even see any difference compared to degreasing and lubing the current ones isn't a good investment imo.  If they are broken and need to be replaced, any non-Dynasys Shimano derailleurs should work afaik though you are best off with a RD that is designed to work with the same number of speeds. With only a 7 speed bike that means your options are very limited in terms of upgrades without changing to more speeds (which would be an even more excessive upgrade for this bike) or looking on eBay for vintage higher end parts from the 80s and 90s"

It hasn't been driven regularly (haven't actually taken it out for 2-3 years now, due to the lack of time, which has been freed recently). Cleaned it up roughly but haven't taken it apart to clean it properly, probably wouldn't know to set it up properly again.

The QR can put a little more pressure on the axle that will turn a ball bearing from 'perfect' to 'too tight by a hair'. Ideally the axle should have some play before tightening the QR."
bikewrench,3cnd7f,redfoxiii,2,Thu Jul 9 07:44:36 2015 UTC,I tried loosening the quick release so that it was barely being clamped and I don't seem to notice any change. However I will give the wheels a chance as you suggested and just keep riding them.   I'm not racing or anything so as long as the wheel isn't being damaged it's no big deal. I might end up getting the hubs serviced when comes fall anyways and get someone to see if anything seems off.   Thanks for the reply!

bikewrench,3cnd7f,throwinit9,0,Fri Jul 10 04:12:48 2015 UTC,"Woah, no way, man. That's the point of the nuts outside of the cones: cone tension is set and then the lock nut and cone are cinched together to prevent the cone moving.  For it to work the way you've described, the axle itself would have to compress from the force of the lock nuts being squeezed together.  The only way it would really, noticeably, get tighter from a QR skewer is if the axle was broken into pieces."
bikewrench,3cnd7f,redfoxiii,2,Fri Jul 10 04:09:20 2015 UTC,"For it to work the way you've described, the axle itself would have to compress from the force of the lock nuts being squeezed together.   That's exactly what happens.  From Sheldon himself:   No binding with no play is the proper adjustment for solid-axle hubs, but if you have quick-release hubs, there is an additional, complicating factor. When you tighten the quick-release lever, it tends to compress the axle just a little bit. If the adjustment was just right with the wheel on your bench, it will be too tight when the wheel is installed and the quick release tightened. For this reason, quick-release hubs should be adjusted so that there is a very sight amount of play in the axle when the wheel is not installed. This play should disappear when the quick release is tightened to the dropouts. My article on cone adjustment describes a special home-made tool lets you get the adjustment right when the wheel is off the bicycle. You might also keep a pair of dropouts sawn off a junk fork, so you can tighten the quick release on them and still spin the axle to check for binding."

For quick release type hubs, snug the cone down until it contacts the ball bearings, and turn back counter-clockwise one quarter turn (90 degrees). This will purposely make the bearing adjustment too loose. Hold cone with cone wrench and tighten locknut fully. Proceed to HUB ADJUSTMENT below.   I will mention that this has always been my experience working with QR hubs."

bikewrench,3cni5p,ysengrimus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:59:18 2015 UTC,"All things being equal larger flange diameter = better bracing angle = stronger wheel, especially in the rear.  But all things aren't equal.  Chasing this metric when not only are you going to be ignorant of the variance in casting/forging quality across brands, but also building with modern high-tension components, is not a great use of time.  Proof of the pudding is in the tasting, and on a modern wheel with sufficient spokes the types of failures bracing angle would help just aren't a realistic concern.  You're not building an ultralight wheel where ever last scrap of strength needs to be eeked out so that another pair of spokes can be dropped...  All this is moot if you've historically been breaking spokes on 36h wheels of known good tension."

bikewrench,3cn7dl,MinimusNadir,2,Thu Jul 9 08:52:18 2015 UTC,I can't answer with certainty but I believe you can probably do 11-30 by winding in the B tension screw. You'll likely need a new chain unless the existing one has been cut long.

bikewrench,3cn7dl,uluchay,2,Thu Jul 9 13:07:08 2015 UTC,Sora already has a medium cage derailleur. The part you're looking for is RD-3500 GS. As with all Shimano road RD's SS is short cage and GS is medium cage. Check what version you have. You might also need to run a slightly longer chain.
bikewrench,3cn7dl,uluchay,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:37:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. If it is short cage, do you think it will still work with 11-30 if I run a longer chain and just increase b-tension? Obviously this isn't ideal but it's a much cheaper option."
bikewrench,3cn7dl,uluchay,2,Thu Jul 9 13:13:53 2015 UTC,"According to Shimano it should be fine. The short cage has a 32T Max sprocket and the cage length is more about the crankset than the cassette. However, check the current cassette, for example I have 52/39 with 11/28 and I wouldn't switch to a 11/30. If she has 26 or less as the biggest cog it can help, 27,28,30 don't really change much combined to a 39T in front."

bikewrench,3cn7dl,Stickytapemeasure,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:57:21 2015 UTC,I have three years and 7k kms under my belt and I accept defeat against standard. I'm currently waiting for my compact to arrive. It's not just about the climbs. A pro uses a standard because he usually uses the 14 or 15 in the back which gives him a straight chain line. I on the other hand go between 21 and 19 which are third and fourth respectively. The chain wears faster and every time you look down you get disappointed.
bikewrench,3cn7dl,Stickytapemeasure,2,Thu Jul 9 14:50:57 2015 UTC,"Short cage and medium cage clear the same max cog.  The difference is in how much chain slack they can take up - that's what the cage itself does.  The 3500GS has a publishied max cog of 32 and 41T of takeup.  30-11=19T of takeup needed for the cassette which leaves 22T for the chainrings.  A Sora triple is 50/xx/30T, 50-30=20T.  so 39T total.  So we can see that the 3500GS is designed to work with a standard triple and the widest possible 11-32 cassette.    The 3500SS is for the smaller 16T differences of a double.  (37T total capacity = 32-11 + 50-34)  Point being either will work Just Fine with a 11-32, you pick the cage length based on the crankset.    Don't forget a new, longer, chain."

bikewrench,3cm56d,bigwhiskey103,15,Wed Jul 8 23:56:29 2015 UTC,"With spokes, bigger is not always better. It sounds counter intuitive, but double-butted spokes, which have a thinner center diameter, 2.0-1.8-2.0, are considered stronger because they flex more and provide a little give. At 320lbs you might want to consider a wheel with more spokes like a tandem wheel (40 or 48 spokes) which is intended to carry the weight of two 160lb riders."
bikewrench,3cm56d,coolkevin77,9,Thu Jul 9 00:33:09 2015 UTC,"A wider tire with lower pressure takes up some of the impact, sparing your spokes some.

More cushion on the spoke, and may have no more rolling resistance for you than the skinnies."

bikewrench,3cm56d,thedavemcsteve,3,Thu Jul 9 05:31:00 2015 UTC,"A lot of things about spokes and wheels are somewhat counter-intuitive. Although spokes are in tension, they support a rim exactly the same way as they would if they were in compression, like a wagon wheel. With every rotation, spokes are unloaded, partially, or even fully, as the rim section near the ground deflects. This constant cycling of tension can fatigue the spokes to eventual failure.  Steel has what's known as a fatigue limit. Fatigue is cumulative, but below that limit it doesn't accumulate. Stress may be concentrated at places where spokes bend, which is why they usually fail at the elbows. When spokes are made at the factory residual static stresses are often left, and/or when lacing into a hub. These residual static stresses are superimposed on the dynamic stresses of normal wheel rotation. The combination of the two may exceed the fatigue threshold.  Spokes must be stress relieved in a finished wheel in order to prevent fatigue accumulation and eventual failure. This is often not done since bike mechanics don't understand the engineering. It is a quick and trivial process described in articles on Sheldon Brown's web site.  All things being equal, heavier loads require more spokes, and/or thicker rims, and/or higher spoke tensions. Maximum spoke tension is usually limited by rim cracking around spoke holes (fatigue there, too). Heavy riders should look up the manufacturers maximum spoke tension spec for the rim and dial that in with a good tensiometer. The purpose of high spoke tension is to keep the rim supported to protect it, once the spoke goes to 0 tension under load it's no longer doing that. Even fully unloading the spoke cyclically will not fatigue the spoke if the maximum tension is below the fatigue threshold, and the way to achieve that is by stress relieving.  TL, DR; Before you do anything else, stress relieve the spokes, bring tension to spec and true the wheel. The real problem with heavy loads is rim failure, not spoke failure."

bikewrench,3cmdt0,Moegain,7,Thu Jul 9 01:05:43 2015 UTC,"Well, hang on a minute everyone who is saying the shop is at fault for instaling the BB without any grease. What standard is the BB on your bike? It sounds to me like it might be PF30, in which case the shop was right to not have put any sort of lube or grease on it if they were installing into a carbon shell. You don't lube the plastic casing of a PF30 bottom bracket before installing it into a carbon shell; you just press it in dry.   If it was a PF30, they shouldn't have put grease on it when you brought it back though. The carbon surface on a PF30 frame can get wallowed out from the cranks being ridden while loose and causing the BB to start to work it's way out. It sounds to me like that may be what happened. If they put grease on the PF bottom bracket and had you ride around like that, it could be the cause of your problem.   If it's a regular BB30, there is no way for the shell to be ""too big"" for the bottom bracket bearings. A regular BB30 should be greased liberally when installed, but if it isn't, your bearings will just corrode prematurely.   I'm assuming it's not a threaded BB, as you said it was a racing bike and none of the things the shop told you would make sense for a threaded bottom bracket."

bikewrench,3cmdt0,toecutters,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:34:25 2015 UTC,I'm not sure. They said the shell got bigger because there wasn't any grease in there. It was a tight fit when they initially installed it
bikewrench,3cmdt0,TherapistMD,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:49:30 2015 UTC,"I think I see what you're getting at, but a press-fit bottom bracket doesn't work that way. It's supposed to be really tight when installed because friction is the only thing holding it in place. So the mechanic is saying that since there wasn't grease on the BB, it took a lot of torque to press it in there, which must have stretched the BB shell on the frame? Carbon fiber doesn't stretch, and alloy will only get mis-shaped if a BB with alloy cups was being pressed in crooked and someone really worked at it.   From your original description of the problem, it sounds to me like your cranks may not have either been installed tight enough, or been missing a spacer, which let to them having play. If you ride press-fit cranks with play in them long enough or hard enough, it can cause the BB cups to start to move around, which can cause them to abrade the carbon shell, removing material and making it so a bottom bracket will never fit right into that frame again until it's repaired.   Hopefully that's not the case for you. The first thing I would do is to try a new Bottom bracket. It's possible to damage a press fit BB with a plastic shell when installing it, which could make it not fit right.   If the BB shell on the frame is actually damaged, I know that Ruckus and possibly some other carbon repair company (Predator?) can add carbon to the BB shell and then face it back down to the original spec. It's not a cheap repair, and you have to ship the frame to them, but it might be worth it if it's an expensive bike.   Good luck!"

Beyond that, your best bet is to take your bike (or just the levers if they're already off) to a nearby bicycle cooperative and sift through their bins of used parts.

I'd be surprised if they charged more than $5 or $10 for the entire brake lever assembly.  Edit: Also, definitely consider /u/levelsaddle says.

The part you're looking for is FD-2403 but any FD-XXX3 should work the same.   Both easy operations, check if your chain has a quick link, otherwise you'll need to break it with a chain tool. I don't have much experience with CX brakes but I believe most V or Mini V brakes should work.   Another thought is to repair them, brakes and FD's don't just stop working. They might be blocked by dirt since it's a CX bike. Try randomly spraying some WD40 on moving parts. See if it does the trick."

There's already good suggestions here.  Keep an open mind when searching for the culprit, as oftentimes the sound isn't coming from where you think you're hearing it.  Also:   Always properly torque all fasteners to their recommended values Use grease on parts that move or slide against each other during normal use. Use anti-seize compound in places (like seatposts) that don't move during normal use, but may during adjustments or maintenance.  Use a thread locking compound on the threads of fasteners."

bikewrench,3ckeob,ninzo09,2,Wed Jul 8 16:29:38 2015 UTC,You should be able to unthread the pull chain that actuates the shifter in the hub and drip some lube i n there. Also if it is a coaster brake type the brake arm slides back when not in the dropouts to reveal a grease port. I would use phil wood tenacious oil. Also if your having shifting issues it may be due to your hub being loose
bikewrench,3ckeob,DvesWeasel,2,Wed Jul 8 17:23:58 2015 UTC,"I would rather recommend a thicker lubricant like grease for the bearings, you can use lighter oils to clean it all but shimano usually wants grease on their products (Alfine11 specifically needs oil though).

The bad news, if you've played with the H and L limit screws (and not put them back where they were before) the derailleur may be out of adjustment.  You should try to add a bit more cable tension to the FD cable.  There should be a barrel adjuster on your front shifter.  Screw it counter-clockwise (it should start extending from the shifter) one half turn at a time until the rubbing stops.    If that doesn't fix it, you'll need to unscrew your H limit screw, the one you labeled ""1.""  Unscrew it about 1/4 of a turn at a time until the rubbing stops.

bikewrench,3cjcjt,snowboardracer,2,Wed Jul 8 13:19:25 2015 UTC,"Unless you're cross chaining, you shouldn't have any rubbing on a properly-adjusted derailleur.  That is, if you're in the big ring (up front) and the smallest cog (in back), the chain shouldn't rub.  If you're cross chaining (big up front, large cog in back), you may get some rubbing on the FD.  Sometimes it's unavoidable even when perfectly tuned.    If you're rubbing on the big/small, small/big combinations, take it and have it adjusted.  Some cables tend to stretch a bit after the first 100 +/- miles or so, and your LBS can adjust the tension in a few minutes.  While you're there, ask the mechanic to explain what s/he's doing.  It's invaluable to understand how the barrel adjusters and cable tension affects either derailleur -- you'll eventually need to make an adjustment while on a ride!"

bikewrench,3cjwz7,D0rk4L,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:21:27 2015 UTC,All I could tell was the rubber over the bead was a little scuffed from popping off. No kinks/tears/etc. I am wondering if I am just dumb and didn't seat it carefully enough in the first place.
bikewrench,3cjwz7,jeseely,5,Wed Jul 8 14:26:29 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I've had a few tires that I was sure were seated on the rim, and then 10-20 minutes later I've had them blow off the rim. It's rare, but I have had it happen a handful of times.  As far as the rim/tire combo goes, a 23c tire on an A23 is absolutely fine. The internal width is something like 17.5mm, so you're not even close to 1:1, which we've found works with most rims/tires. We actually recommend 23c+ even on the wider Aileron.   Few questions:  -what rim tape (material and width) are you running? -has your rear tire been okay? Have you tried swapping a known good tire to the rim? -what size range tube are you running?  -seely"
bikewrench,3cjwz7,jeseely,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:44:24 2015 UTC,"Hi!  Let's see...  The rim tape is some pretty narrow OEM stuff from wheelbuilder.com.  The same tire's been fine on the other wheel.  I haven't tried a different tire yet but I certainly will if the Rubino hops off again.  Tubes are Bontrager butyl 700x23-25.  When I remounted the Rubino after flatting, I noticed I really had to wrestle the bead into place.  I'm used to Contis, usually Gatorskins or CycloXKings, and they easily snap right in place.  That's what made me wonder whether I just didn't quite have the bead seated in the first place.  I like problems that are my fault, I can fix those.  :)  Love the rims by the way, thanks for the advice."
bikewrench,3cjwz7,senoritaoscar,2,Wed Jul 8 15:06:47 2015 UTC,"I will say that the Rubino, in my experience selling them for a decade or so, could be a tough tire to mount (though not on the scale of the dreaded Zaffiro ;)  Sounds like your tube/rim strip setup should be fine. We really recommend a thin ""plastic"" tape like our Velotape with the A23, but others do work. They may just make tire mounting a little more difficult.  With the  A23/most tubeless ready rims, try to keep the bead of the tire in the center of the rim as much as possible and off the ""shoulders"" by the bead. This will give you more slack in the tire.   If it keeps happening, definitely keep in contact with us."
bikewrench,3cjwz7,senoritaoscar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:28:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll give you a poke if anything else happens!  I should clarify -- when I was talking about wrestling with the tire bead, I meant that once the tire was mounted on the rim, I still had to fight with it to get the bead up off the rim tape and into the bead hook in a couple spots.  If I recall my Gatorskins correctly, they have a lower friction material on the bead exterior. The Rubinos have more of a tread rubber type material on the bead.  That's what I was wondering whether I had failed to do previously..."
bikewrench,3cjwz7,ImaginarySpider,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:08:06 2015 UTC,"Possibly; normally it'll pop itself off when you inflate the tire, but I've seen a tire get ridden around for a bit and then come off because the bead wasn't completely seated. Can you reinstall and try to ride it again? Also, are you using the same rim/tire combo on F/R? If it works on one, it should work on both, for example."

bikewrench,3cjvlu,cleansoap,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:48:06 2015 UTC,"That's actually an excellent idea.  Never even thought of it!  Are there any compatibility issues to look at when it comes to swapping rings?  Also, would moving to a nicer crankset be worth it in any facet for an intermediate rider?  I figure the Oval set on there is probably heavy/flexy compared to what I'd get with Shimano.  Thanks for you response!"
bikewrench,3cjvlu,cleansoap,2,Wed Jul 8 22:37:11 2015 UTC,"If the feel does not bother you the level of flex is (energy wise) completely insignificant, esp on a BB86 system with the wide bearings fully integrated into the shell.  $X will buy one a lot more flex improvement in a square taper setup than $X will buy in BB86 as the latter system is so much more inherently stiffer.  As to weight you'd need to pull specs.  Low end cranksets are typically heavy, but how many g per $ CX50 saves you I'm not sure.  May be a hundred g, may be zero.  As to compatibility it literally is as simple as 4 vs 5 arms and matching BCD.  Want to make sure you're getting 10-speed compatible rings as well, but that's not really an issue in 2015."
bikewrench,3cjvlu,cleansoap,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:58:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not remotely good enough to know what a proper feel from a crankset is, to be honest, so maybe it is worth waiting.  I'm sure I could stand to lose a about 10000 grams myself, so I guess I'll be alright saving some money and dropping the weight.  I've been reading up on the 46/34 combo and it seems like people really like it. 42 with a bash guard looks like an interesting option as well, but I'd probably need to change my cassette from 11-32 if I were to do that.  Thank you for the in depth explanation, it makes a lot of sense and I appreciate the thoroughness.  It seems like it wouldn't require much adjustment to go to the 46 aside from lowering and tweaking my FD, correct?"
bikewrench,3cjvlu,D0rk4L,2,Wed Jul 8 23:39:50 2015 UTC,"Right, lower and tweak of the FD, and dropping links from the chain if you want.  46/36 is the common CX pairing, but a double crankset is really inner ring agnostic (so long as you keep it no more than 14T smaller than the outer) and I like it because 46 in the big allows me to stay in the large chainring longer (really, I never would spin out at 50:11 ratio) and those times I'm in the inner ring I want it as low as I can go.    (and 48.5:11 is the equivalent of what old-school road kings would have had as their top gear (53:12) not but a few years ago.  And I ain't no road king.  46:11 is (for me) Just Fine)"
bikewrench,3cjvlu,D0rk4L,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:13:10 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming after only losing 4 teeth I'd only need to drop a single link and it would just crisp things up on the shifting end and prevent dropping the chain slightly more?

bikewrench,3cjn51,blueblackdit,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:48:42 2015 UTC,"First, let's make sure you're adjusting the hub correctly.  Are you using a cone wrench to hold the cones in place while you tighten the locknuts?  If not, then the cones will get overtightened and it will be hard to spin the wheel.  If you are doing the adjustment correctly, and the hub still feels ""bumpy"" or ""gritty"" when you spin it, then your problem is probably ""pitting"".  That's what happens when you ride on a hub with no lubrication.  The ball bearings ""dig in"" to the surrounding metal and ruin the surface.  If you've got pitting on the cone, then you can maybe just get new cones (check your local bike shop for these).  If there's pitting on your hub, though, you're SOL... the hub is trash.  You can do an image search for ""hub pitting"" to see what pitting damage looks like.   New bearings are just bad quality?   Doubt it.  But is it possible they're the wrong size?   Wrong grease? I got some random grease, that looks like it contains grafite.   Any old grease should work.   Also, one more (dumb) question: When I buy a new hub, does it come ready to use, or would I have to do some kind of hub servicing before using it for the first time?   If you buy a new wheel, then no service is required.  At the risk of stating the obvious: If you really mean buy just a new hub, then you need to lace it to a rim with spokes.  That's usually not a job for a beginner, and it's expensive to hire someone to do it.  Pictures might help with the diagnosis, if you can.  Also, why did you buy a new axle?  What was wrong with the old one?  Did you keep all the old cones, locknuts, etc?  Or did the new axle come with new ones?  Finally, if you find that your hub is trash, buying a new front wheel is an option.  But, also, you can check craiglist, yard sales, etc.  You might be able to find a crappy bike for cheap money that has the same size wheels as yours.  If that bike's front wheel is okay, just swap it onto your bike."

That's what happens when you ride on a hub with no lubrication.    In my defense, I took the bikes (mine and my wife's) to the nearest bike shop (I had seem good reviews about it) to do what the guy called a ""full overhaul"", before taking the bikes off their ""hibernation"". Shouldn't hub servicing be included in that?! (After a few experiences with that shop, I got the feeling that if they are good, it's probably for expensive bikes only. Looks like they don't care very much if you bring them a cheaper bike. I'll be doing my own maintenance from now on.)   Doubt it. But is it possible they're the wrong size?   No, same size: 1/4"".

At least one of the old ones showed noticeable ""scratches"" on the bearings path, that looked like imperfect forging. So, I already switched the whole axle and nuts.  I ended up mounting the wheel with old bearings and leaving it that way, because they don't seem any worse than the new ones. That's why I got to think I need a new hub. I would have to open it again to take pictures, but I'm not sure it's worth it.  I'm not in US, so no craiglist, I guess. But I'll also look on our local equivalent for a used one. Thanks."

Shouldn't hub servicing be included in that?!   Yes.  Even if he didn't repack the grease, he should definitely have at least adjusted the cones and locknuts.

I'm having trouble finding a new 26"" wheel that comes ready and does not cost more than the whole bike.   Alas, it might actually cost even more to buy just the hub.  If your spokes and nipples are still in very good shape, and if your new hub is the same dimensions as your old hub, then you might be able to reuse your current spokes and not have to buy new ones.  But, paying someone to build up the new wheel will be expensive.  This is something that you can learn to do yourself, and it's kinda fun, but it's not easy at all.  And, if you want to do it right, it's really important that you get the right tension on the spokes.  Allegedly some old pros can do this by feel, but for non-experts, you need to use a ""tensiometer"", which is an expensive tool.   Because I wanted new cones. At least one of the old ones showed noticeable ""scratches"" on the bearings path, that looked like imperfect forging. So, I already switched the whole axle and nuts.   I'd bet that those scratches are pitting, rather than bad forging.  And, that might mean that the hub is pitted as well, and there's not really a fix for that.  Another explanation might be that your new cones don't match the old cones.  (Not all cones have the same ""profile"", and if your new cones have a different profile, that might be the issue?)"

bikewrench,3chnsd,A_Torontonient,2,Wed Jul 8 00:38:29 2015 UTC,Ive never repainted a carbon bike fork before but I have repainted a lot of shitty old cars.  The old paint shouldnt have any adverse affects on the new paint. Wash it to remove any dirt or gross shit. Then as the dude said lightly sand it (fine grit. I buy 3M shit thats meant for autos). This gives a good/even surface for the primer to adhere to and gets rid of the old clear. Then from there the quality of the finished product is dependent on the amount of work you put in when laying paint/between coats.

If the star nut stays put long enough to clamp the stem, then what's the problem?  I've reused a star nut after banging it trough a steerer with a broomhandle, when it was already rusted enough to lose one of the flanges without me touching in. I installed it in the new fork before cutting it to lenght. I made sure that I couldn't pull it up by using the topcap and tightening the bolt on the steerer.   In any case: If you use the tool to instal the star nut. Can't you simply thread the starnut onto the tool again after shortening the steerer to push it in deeper? If you use the tool, it would be level and straigt again wouldn't it?  In any case: If you decide to shorten the steerer, the nut needs to go in further.

bikewrench,3chehe,Stickytapemeasure,2,Wed Jul 8 12:10:41 2015 UTC,"+1   I think that this is an important point. The top cap and star nut are only used to adjust the headset. Once set (and during riding), it doesn't do anything. The stem is what holds everything together/maintains pressure. There's not a lot of precision needed with the star nut. It needs to be in ~3/4"" to 1"" and straight enough that the thread points at the hole in the top cap. Other than this, it doesn't matter how it's in there. I've used wooden dowels in the past, but the last time I did it, I just threaded a longer bolt into the nut and slowly tapped in into the stem doing my best to keep it straight. ""Good enough"" is a fine outcome for star nut installation. It's not like tensioning spokes, cottered cranks, or cup and cone adjustment where it's important to get things just so."

bikewrench,3chehe,Sirlazzlo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:16:11 2015 UTC,"The tool used to push the star nut in - it goes a very specific depth.

bikewrench,3chehe,insideouthoodie,0,Tue Jul 7 23:28:40 2015 UTC,"Because the star nut tool will only allow you to install the star nut to a specific depth and, more importantly, completely level to the top of the steer tube.  Once you install the star nut and then try to pound it deeper you will sacrifice the integrity of the star nut, and thus the proper function of the star nut and your safety.  Figure out your length with spacers, ride the bike for a while to make certain this is the length that you desire then cut your steerer to that desired length and install a NEW star nut using the star nut tool."
bikewrench,3cgb7x,Coldieee,6,Tue Jul 7 18:10:03 2015 UTC,"You had a sealed bearing come completely apart. This is not going back together, the cartridge bearing which is behind the snap ring in the body needs a new friend.  I'm on mobile so I will go back and look at the pic, then edit with some more info.  EDIT: RIGHT. So, the only parts in there that aren't exploded cartridge bearing are the space w/o a groove in it, and the 'unsure about this guy' which is the dust cover. The nut goes on the axle when it's back together, and there's a cassette lock ring. All the other bits are failed sealed bearing.  In reassembly, the non-grooved spacer goes into the shell, then a new sealed bearing, then the dust cover.  To be honest, if you don't have any experience working on these, I'd take it to a shop to get put back together - you'll have to order at least one new bearing, and setting bearings without ruining them is tricky if you have no experience."

As long as everything is compatible - derailleur pull ratio, shifter indexing, and freehub width - you can upgrade.

If these pieces are still fine you can get by by buying parts (Amazon is your friend) like a new casette, chainrings or crankset, BB, cables, brakepads etc. Secondhand wheels can be had pretty easily in the $100-$150 range.  If everything is shot you should go for a full groupset from eBay or another online retailer. Sora and Claris are good values.  Just make sure you match things like the BB thread, correct clamp size for the derailleur, crank arm length and such"

bikewrench,3cfhrt,bbelo,3,Tue Jul 7 14:41:17 2015 UTC,"Ok, headset has two threaded pieces. The one you are pointing to is the adjuster. Starting with this piece, take a very large crescent wrench and use it to turn the adjuster clock wise until your wiggling stops. You want to turn that adjuster little by little, and check each maybe quarter of a turn to see if it stop wiggling. The reason to do this little by little is because if you over tighten you will make it hard to turn the handle bars.   Ok, so you turn the adjuster with the wrench until you find the exact spot that just barely makes it stop wiggling. When you find this spot, your going to actually turn the adjuster just slightly counter clockwise so that there is maybe just a SLIGHT wiggle again but very close to perfect. Now you have to identify the second piece on your headset that is threaded, and in you picture it looks like it is the big nut sitting three pieces up from the adjuster. This is the lock nut. Using your first wrench to hold the adjuster, take a second wrench and tight the lock nut clock wise until you work it all the way down to the adjuster. With a final turn, crank the lock nut clock wise and the adjuster counter clockwise maybe 1/8 of a turn (this will counter lock them and insure it wont need adjusting again for a long time). Because you cranked the lock nut, it should have also cranked the adjuster slightly and take care of that slight bit of wiggle you left when you turned the adjuster. To check that it's tight, hold the front brake and push the wheel. Does it Knock? if not, lift the front wheel off the ground and push the handle bar side to side. Does it move easily? If it does not knock and it moves easily, congrats, you have just adjusted your headset! If it knocks, it means you need to redo and slightly tighten the adjuster a little more. If it moves rough or hard or slow, then redo but loosen the adjuster slightly. If it is hard to move and is rough to push, then you need to replace the head set."

bikewrench,3cgubq,NorthernDynamics,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:21:47 2015 UTC,If the crankarm fell off while you were riding it needs to be replaced. Just putting it back on and putting on a new nut will result in the crankarm falling off again in the very near future.  Any bike shop or co-op in your area should be able to get you a new crankarm and nut.

bikewrench,3cekgd,heman__,8,Tue Jul 7 08:21:28 2015 UTC,"If everything does fit you won't encouter too many problems. You probably need new cables. Chances that the housings are the right sizes are slim, but I would avise you to get new cables anyway, even if it would work out.  What to check:   Bottombracket! What do you have in your Trek 1.2? I presume from the pictures and square taper bottombracket that it's a BSA frame. Order your chinese frame with BSA bottom bracket if you want to do all of your maintenance yourself. Press-fit systems are a little more complicated/require specific tools.  Headset: Check if the frame comes with a headset. Probably not, so you'll have to get a new one. Unless you get the same headset dimmensions. you'll have to check if you have an integrated/semi-integrated or standard headset, and what you need in the new frame. Measure inside & outside diameter for both top and bottom cups if no headset is provided with the frame.  seatpost clamp: check if the diameter for the seatpost is the same. Or if the frame comes with a clamp.  handlebars: depending whether you get a stem with the frame or not: Check if the clamp diameter matches the bars. You could probably take your old stem and put it on the new frame no problem.  Problems with a chinese factory frame: GET A TORQUE WRENCH! It's not worth trying to save money by not getting one, and cracking the frame or another part by overtightening anything. Or even worse, undertightening and loosing parts while cycling."

bikewrench,3cee55,solitary_wanderer,4,Tue Jul 7 06:55:57 2015 UTC,"I can't watch the video here at work, but one thing to consider is that no chainring is perfectly round/centered. You've always got a tight spot and a slack spot with any singlespeed.   You can mitigate it somewhat by loosening up the chainring bolts just a bit so the ring can shift around a bit on the crank spider, and give the crank a few rotations, then tighten them. This often helps ""center"" the ring on the spider a bit more.   Once you do that, find your tight spot and set the chain tension at the tightest point for just a bit of slack."
bikewrench,3cee55,jeseely,3,Tue Jul 7 12:36:12 2015 UTC,It sounds like the chain binding on the teeth. Have you checked the sprocket and chain ring for wear and the chain for stretch?

I haven't checked the chain for stretch yet, and I'm doing something else at the moment, but I'll check later tonight and update.  This bike pretty much hasn't been used before, but has been sitting for a couple of years so I don't think it's because of wear and tear."

Here's an album  of the chain, chain ring, and rear sprocket that I just took after cleaning everything - they all seem to be fine.  Edit: It's off by about 1-2mm.

bikewrench,3cee55,auftakt,2,Wed Jul 8 03:06:00 2015 UTC,"What kind of chain are you using? If your setup is 3/32 it's generally better to use an 8 speed chain (which is 3/32) rather than a single speed chain (1/8). While it's capable of using the larger chain, generally it's loud and has much more lateral play than I would ever like to have. On the other hand, 1/8 cogs and chainrings should and need to be paired with 1/8 chains."
bikewrench,3cee55,auftakt,3,Tue Jul 7 14:15:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm wondering if this is the issue. Is your fixed gear cog a 1/8"" cog or the rarer 3/32""? If you just bought a generic fixed gear cog or track cog, you've almost certainly gotten a 1/8"" cog and your chain is a 3/32"" chain so there will be some weirdness.

bikewrench,3cdhk4,B1CYCl3R3P41RM4N,2,Tue Jul 7 02:52:05 2015 UTC,"Resources? Find the best wheel builder in your town, make friends with him, then beg him to help you build a wheel. It is art. Here is a start though: clearly you know your spoke size, so go ahead and buy the spokes and brass nipples. Get a little tub of spoke prep, tap one spoke in the spoke prep- just the tip, then roll two spokes together to set the prep through the threads. Do this with all spokes, then set em out to dry for a beer. Now build the wheel 3 cross like most tutorials say- driveside/ off side. Tighten all spokes until 2 full threads are still visible. Now start at the valve hole and tighten every 7th spoke 1 turn until you get to where you started, then 1/2 turn until you get where you started, then 1/4... The wheel should be almost properly tensioned at this point. The next 20mins are just fine tuning the true. This is the art. I can't explain it here."
bikewrench,3cdhk4,p4lm3r,2,Tue Jul 7 03:03:49 2015 UTC,"Skipping all those spokes is kind of a waste of time in my experience. As long as you're tensioning up the wheel gradually, there's no need to skip spokes to maintain balance"

bikewrench,3cdhk4,FalseBuddha,2,Tue Jul 7 13:42:11 2015 UTC,"Re spoke the wheel. Replacing the spokes as they break throws off the tension of the wheel. Newer spokes are generally a little less elastic and as a result tension up differently. Respoking a wheel is doable at home, but you should get a shop to calculate and cut the spokes for you. Try not to cut the old spokes out of the wheel, the rapid change in tension is hard on the rim. Go around the wheel loosening each spoke one revolution at a time until the spokes are loose to ease the tension off the rim. Lube the nipples before doing this, triflow works great. For the build you should look up some videos or something, I'm not gonna explain all that"
bikewrench,3cdl1k,_occur,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:10:01 2015 UTC,"Hi there, My post might be long winded, but i will try to be as clear as I can. I had 2 spesh bikes before and all I can say is - ditch that mindset! Why. I hate those weird lose bearings sitting in those mindset cups. They are nasty, hard to service, low quality and bot supported by spesh anymore. I would strongly recommend to swap it for CaneCreek IS-40. Works to the moon and back and smooth as a butter. And you dont need to rob a bank to buy one. How it works. Mindset is two stupid cups sitting inside the head tube. On my first bike the cups were really tight and almost felt like welded in. So i bought it to spesh store and they popped out those bloody cups in a matter of a seconds. On a second bike I already did know whats where so i took a screwdriver and a wooden mallet and slowly working around smashed them out. When you take them off you are left with two groved edges were they sit. Thats where new CC sealed bearings sits in. All you need from the old mindset is is a cap which should be marked VK-** or VPK-** or something like that, where ** is numbers. Then using same wooden mallet and a tube from a hoover smash on new CC-IS40 fork crown race. And then put everything together.  Sealed bearings, when you put them in, edged sine should face inwards ;)  I understand if you will decide to stick to that stupid mindset. Then I guess all you need is a CC IS-40 crown race. But email CaneCreek before buying they are quiet good at responding, or their website has a compatibility calculator with most of the bikes on so you could reffer to that.  *I love spesh but their lack of support for older models is astonishing. So everytime I see someone asking about the mindset I copy/paste instructions above.  Hopefully that helps ;)  Edit - type in a google canecreek headset finder and you should be able to determine what is what ;)"

If it's got a nicer valve on it where you can remove the core (either with the proper tool or pliers), you might be able to clean it out and get the valve working again."
bikewrench,3cc031,D0rk4L,2,Mon Jul 6 19:11:21 2015 UTC,"In most places, sealant tubes aren't necessary.  Where I live, you have to use them or be prepared to fix a flat on the way to where you're going and again on your way home.  My worst record was 4 flats in one day, all on pavement from thorns.  The clogged valves don't seem to happen very much with the slime brand sealant."
bikewrench,3cc031,Turbobaker4,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:42:31 2015 UTC,"Is the sealant even supposed to work? The first one I used, I got a flat... And it sure as hell didn't seal itself up. Unless I'm supposed to do something special for it to work?  So far my experience with those tubes is not great. The first one had a flat that did not seal itself. I patched up the flat and it didn't work (probably because the repair kit I have is so old and the rubber cement didn't work well). Then I get the second one on there, and the sealant clogs up the valve..."
bikewrench,3cc031,Turbobaker4,2,Mon Jul 6 22:11:04 2015 UTC,"It's been my experience that only the green Slime brand works.  And even then it only seals small thorn punctures, and not all the time.  When you have a bad thorn problem like in my area it can mean the difference between replacing the tube once every couple months or every couple days.    You can not patch tubes with sealant in them because of the oils in the sealant.  The glue just won't stick now matter how much you try to clean the area.  I'm sure some people have done it but I wouldn't trust the patch."

Spesh armadillo, conti gatorskin, schwalbe marathon plus, etc. dropped my flats to 1-2 per year. also the most expensive.  Tire liner. Mr Tuffy is what we sell, dunno what else is out there. Same principle as a flat prevention tire, a little bit cheaper. Not sure what the material is. Installation can be a pain. Never used one personally so can't speak to their effectivity.  Puncture resistant tube.  Helps a bit but I still see plenty of them with punctures. Heavy. Also difficult to install sometimes.  Sealant. Garbage. Covered that above.

bikewrench,3cbr3s,AlabamaIceMan,8,Mon Jul 6 17:58:02 2015 UTC,You need the sealant. That's what seals any microscopic holes on the tire carcass as well as around the bead and the base of the valve. If the bead wasn't set it wouldn't have held air that long.
bikewrench,3cbr3s,D0rk4L,2,Mon Jul 6 18:03:56 2015 UTC,"You need to put the sealant in. If the bead wasn't seated, the tire would instantly deflate. The tire itself is not 100% airtight - that will be sorted out by the sealant.  After sealing it the first time, you might have some gradual air loss for the first week or so, then after that it should hold pressure just like a tube."

A drill press and some way to fasten down the bike, if available, would be safer, but if you're careful, you can do it freehand.  One possibility is that during the drilling, it will simply screw farther in and fall into the frame.  If that happens, you may just have to live with the rattle.  :-(  Applying WD-40 to the bolt as you drill into it should help reduce the amount that the bit grabs and twists the bolt, and you can degrease it before using the extractor.  Like some other uses, WD-40 is often ""good enough"" as a cutting fluid."

There's no getting around that. One trick to installing a troublesome tire is to install the bead on one side of the rim first, then work the other side on. When you get to the tight last section of bead, squeeze the already-installed portion of the bead on both sides of the tire together so that the bead sits close to the centre of the rim well instead of right on the rim's hook.

bikewrench,3c9ax3,guruatma,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:00:26 2015 UTC,To me wider toes are usually easier to get on. If needed get a read with some soapy water on it and lightly coat the tire bead area with the soapy water. This makes getting it on by hand so much easier. If it's still a bit hard out some of the soapy water on the rim as well. Just make sure to do everything off when your done (if you use rim brakes).
bikewrench,3c9ax3,chocolatemeowcats,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:33:31 2015 UTC,"I've seen people use hair dryers to heat up the bead of the tire so that it can stretch a bit easier over the rim.  Of course this wouldn't work on the road.  Another thing people often forget is after you get one side of the tire on, to put the beads of the tire into the recessed grooves in the center of the rim.  This will give you a tiny bit more room to get the rest of the tire on the rim."

And you'd need to apply a crazy amount of force before it breaks.   Best thing you can do is use a tire lever to mount it; use the tire lever as leverage. Or use a bead jack. Tire levers work better imo.

Try using a longer piece of pipe that the lever will fit in and just leverage it back down, if you don't have a long piece of pipe maybe try locking a vice grip on it and just use the extra leverage... If you can move the lever back down with more leverage you might be able to either spin it out and just replace the whole front skewer.   If that doesn't work what about just cutting the skewer and replacing it? If you can get a hacksaw blade somewhere on the actual skewer shaft it's self you might be able to cut one side off and slide it through.

bikewrench,3c8qq8,Ausrufepunkt,8,Sun Jul 5 23:23:04 2015 UTC,"Tire hairs are a byproduct of the manufacturing of the tire. They serve no purpose as an indicator for anything. You can trim them off without fear, as they will likely slowly eat away at the finish of anything they hit at the wheel rotates.   As for the cable hanger, yes you can twist it if needed. Sometimes it's slightly offset so that the cable housing feeding into it doesn't have to make as sharp of a bend under the stem. It's not hurting anything by being offset if that's the reason why it's not straight."

While we're at it, I forgot to mention that one of my braking cables housing is making a squeak when turning right (the cable is on the left side of the frame, I have internal cable rooting, where it exits the frame towards the front the housing is squeaking) I know there are like plastic things you can put around the exit hole (I got one on the back), but that seemed to have been installed when the cable was renewed.

Anyway, I'm unclear if this is a new conversion to tubeless or you already had tubeless and now you're just putting on new tires.  Anyway, there are two common causes for the Bontrager TLR system to not work.  First is the valve must be turned the right way.  I see you replaced yours with a Stans valve.  I'd go back to the correct Bontrager valve and make sure the o-ring is between the plastic rim strip and the base of the valve where it belongs.  In your photos, the o-ring is up the valve a bit which gives me concern that you tried to put the o-ring somewhere else like under the nut that holds the valve tight.  As for rotation, you can often accidentally turn the valve in its little seat by cranking the nut too hard.  Make sure it is aligned properly when you replace it.  The second major cause is the TLR strip is somehow damaged.  A replacement TLR strip to fit your wheel is pretty cheap.  Go to a Trek dealer and pick one up and it'll likely solve your issue.  Oh yeah, the sealant - don't forget to shake the sealant until ALL the sediment is back into mixture instead of settled on the bottom of the squeeze bottle."

bikewrench,3c7ys8,MinimusNadir,0,Tue Jul 7 14:47:15 2015 UTC,"If you found yourself running out of gear on the old cassette during climbs, then definitely go with the 11-34.  If you never used the largest cog in the old cassette, 11-30 might be a good option.  Other than those two scenarios, 11-32 is probably where you want to be.  That being said, you might want to take the opportunity to put in a higher quality cassette, like the CS-HG51.  As for the tire, as long as the tire is at least a little wider than the rim, and you inflate it properly, you're good."
bikewrench,3c7ys8,MinimusNadir,0,Sun Jul 5 20:42:10 2015 UTC,"thanks, ill go with the CS-HG51.  So lets say I get a 26 1.5 rim, the tires could go up to 1.75? 1.95?   Where do you guys purchase your bike gears? I'm having trouble finding a well reviewed 26inch 8 speed rear wheel on amazon. Most of it is 6-7 speed"
bikewrench,3c7ys8,MinimusNadir,0,Sun Jul 5 21:21:32 2015 UTC,"So lets say I get a 26 1.5 rim, the tires could go up to 1.75? 1.95 ?   The tire must be wider than the rim, so if you get a 1.5"" wide rim, you'd need a minimum tire width of 1.75"".  If you want to run more narrow tires (like 1.5""), you'd need a more narrow rim.   I'm having trouble finding a well reviewed 26inch 8 speed rear wheel on amazon. Most of it is 6-7 speed   An 8-speed cassette is the same width as a 9-speed cassette, so a ""9-speed"" wheel should work.    Now, if the hub is a true 10-speed hub, you can't fit an 8-speed cassette.   But if it's a ""9/10"" speed hub, it will also fit an 8.  Since you're already buying a new wheel and cassette, you can take the opportunity to go to 9 or 10 speeds, but that would involve a new derailleur and shifters as well.  Whether it would be of any benefit to you would depend on what you use the bike for.  You might want to talk to a local bike coop about a wheel if you're on a tight budget.  Because most bikes are going to disc brakes, a lot of wheels have rims that won't work with your rim brakes.    That being said, if you can shop somewhere other than Amazon, there's something like this if your budget is pretty low.   There's also this, and Shimano/Sun are better brands, but it's front and rear.  That may be fine with you, may not."
bikewrench,3c77qk,ivanttopaint,5,Sun Jul 5 15:00:48 2015 UTC,"If your paint is still in good shape there is no need to strip it. A light scuff with 600 wet/dry sandpaper and the proper prep and paint products will give you very good results.   I will say that it's unlikely that a beginner with no experience or knowledge will have a VERY hard time producing results anywhere near the quality of a factory finish.  It's all about the prep! You'll need to completely disassemble your bike. Then you'll have to get every trace of grease and oil off of it. Every bit! Use what is called ""wax and grease remover"". You can find it at an auto body supply store. Then you'll have to wash it with dawn dish soap without any fancy stuff in it like lanolin. From this point forward you will not touch it with bare hands. Then degrease it again. Twice.  Now you'll need to remove all stickers. You can try with a hair dryer to remove them but you may need to use an adhesive remover. 3M makes an excellent one that can be found at an auto body supply store. Every bit of adhesive has to be gone. Now degrease it.  Now you can scuff. I like 600 grit wet/dry with soapy water. You can use grey scotchbrite too. Only grey. Scuff until the entire finish is dull. Every nook and cranny. Dry and degrease.  You'll need to mask off your headtube, bottom bracket shell and seat tube with tape. Seal them up really good.  Now for sealer. Degrease and then use a tack cloth that has been unfolded and puffed up to get any dust off of the frame. Spray one decent coat being careful not to get any dry spots or runs. Good luck!  If you got dry spots or runs you'll need to knock them down with 600 wet/dry, clean, degrease and use the tack cloth again. 3 times.  If you're sealer is perfect move on to color.  I suggest a ""single stage"" type of paint. Meaning it is glossy without using a clear coat. Makes it easier for beginners. You'll want a paint that uses a reducer (reducer is chosen based on temp when sprayed) and a hardener. Rattle can stuff that simply air dries will not hold up unless it is allowed to sit for a VERY long time. Hardened paints are basically like a plastic coating that gets hard and shiny from a chemical reaction.   Anyways... Spray one light coat of your color. Let it sit (usually 5-10 minutes between coats) and spray a second wet coat. Let that sit and then hit it real nice with your third and final wet coat.  If you got any runs you can sand and polish them out. If you sand to sealer you'll need to basically start over. Scuff, clean shoot. Usually one nice coat will do it though.  So ya. Get an air compressor, an hvlp paint gun, proper safety gear (respirator, latex/nitrile gloves, eye protection, etc.), a near sterile dustless place to prep and shoot and all of your supplies.  Have fun!  P.S. You can paint carbon forks if you ensure that you do not compromise the clear coat. Just a light scuff."

If you never did it before - you will screw up. Sorry. 4. Preparing CF is even more difficult. So forget the forks. Sorry.  If you will decide to do it. I wish you all the best. Cause everyone has to start somewhere. But even if you commit to do it. Dont do it on a current frame. Just buy a nackered beater frame and start a new project.  *if you dont like the current frame colour. Just bringt it to powdercoating guys.

bikewrench,3c77qk,MrMoar,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:13:14 2015 UTC,"I've have had 2 of my aluminium bikes painted - 1 myself with a strip-sand-prime-rattle can approach, the other I took to a powder-coater to get done professionally.  The rattle can job was OK, but the paint did chip pretty easily afterwards, even with a lot of care to get many thin coats and using the right paint, etc. So it is possible to do yourself, but I found a good finish difficult to get. If you're still interested, this guy on RB gives a bit of a run-down: http://www.rotorburn.com/forums/showthread.php?62163-How-to-Paint-Frames-(Plow-Style)&highlight=plow+style Edit: as MrMoar said below, be prepared to invest some time for this, especially the prep. It takes a long time to get the prep done right, a real long time.  The professional powder coat job looked great and has lasted well through a year of abuse. It cost me $200 for a premium colour (would have been $120 for a normal) with the bike handed over disassembled (it was a Giant Reign 1, so 2 parts, no forks). They weren't a specialty bike painter but more of an industrial set-up. The finish is tough and doesn't scratch or chip easily, so I expect it will last a good long while.   There are mobs about that will do carbon, specifically for bikes. It does cost a fair bit more. No experience with this myself, I just know it exists.  Good luck with the paint job!"
bikewrench,3c77qk,BleinTR,-1,Mon Jul 6 01:03:07 2015 UTC,"Okay so the thing about painting a carbon fork is that it is not conductive like aluminum, and will not be able to tolerate the 400 degree oven that it  takes for the paint to cure. What you can do is use a kind of automotive spray paint called Plasti Dip that can lay over your current paint and practically peel right off when you want to change back to the original color."

bikewrench,3c77qk,A_FLYING_MOOSE,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:52:32 2015 UTC,"No. It does not take 400 degrees for paint to ""cure"". Powdercoat yes but paint no. Any decent quality paint is ""cured"" by using a hardener and with the proper reducer will spray nicely and harden in a wide range of temps from near freezing to REALLY hot.  And plasti dip is the worst possible stuff to use on a bike. It has zero tolerance for the hard use most bikes see.   And what does conductivity have to do with paint hardening? Powdercoat is applied to conductive surfaces that are charged and heat is used to basically melt the powder into a plastic coating that hardens."
bikewrench,3c77qk,EternalNoob,0,Mon Jul 6 05:03:14 2015 UTC,"whoa whoa whoa, let me Wiki that for you. ""The coating is typically applied electrostatically and is then cured under heat to allow it to flow and form a ""skin"". The powder may be a thermoplastic or a thermoset polymer."" And while you say it doesn't take 400 degrees, a typical drying kiln- again let me wiki that for you ""Normally the powders cure at 200 °C (390 °F) for 10 minutes."" And conductivity has everything to do with powder coating and is unrelated to the coating process - Powder coating requires the material to be electrostatic. And while Plasti-Dip may not be the best option it certainly is affordable and widely used on aluminum and carbon frames alike."

But if the brake stops the wheel instantaneously then I guess it's safe to say it didn't? For the main subject - I loosened the front 2 bolts and that's when the mechanism started kind of ""splitting in half"" and I noticed oil drops on the floor. The bike was upside-down, so it was the top side of the mechanism. Here's a pic: http://imgur.com/LDjtRIn"
bikewrench,3c6kpo,super_girl,2,Sun Jul 5 12:47:03 2015 UTC,"Regarding oil on the rotor or pads: the wheel may stop solidly on the stand, but not when you are riding. Test it thoroughly.   Are you sure that the leak happened at the seam? I'm still not sure which bolts were loosened that caused the leak. It looks like the two bolts on the caliper are (1) brake pads retention and (2) bleed plug. If you loosened the bleed plug, it's possible that some oil escaped and it appeared to leak out of the seam. If this is the case, and no air got into the system, you are probably OK. The extra oil in the reservoir at the bride lever will make up for the loss. If it feels squishy, or you can slowly pull the brake lever all the way back to the handlebar, then there is air in the system.   If you are sure that the oil leaked out of the seam, take it to a bike shop. This is not normal."

bikewrench,3c5ggl,jondthompson,2,Sun Jul 5 12:22:37 2015 UTC,"Well, keep in mind that whenever WD-40 is used, it is generally NOT used for what WD-40 was made for.  Yes, it can lubricate something a little bit, because it has light oils in it.  But it's not a very good lubricant, because it wasn't made to be a lubricant.  Yes, it can work as a solvent, because it has some light oils in it.  But it's also not that great of a solvent, because it wasn't made to be a solvent.  ""WD"" stands for WATER DISPLACER.  It was originally developed to displace water off of metal parts and prevent rust.  It's pretty darn good at that.  So, let's say that you leave your toolbox out and the tools get wet - pull them out, wipe them off if you can, and spray them with WD-40.  It'll pull the water off of them, and prevent them from rusting.  Not every situation calls for a high-performance solvent, just like not every situation calls for a high-performance lubricant, and in those situations, WD-40 can still be ""good enough"" for the job."

bikewrench,3c5y29,sick__and__tired,3,Sun Jul 5 03:24:29 2015 UTC,"Whether you could do that would depend entirely upon the oil in question, but most oils have smoke points in excess of 400 degrees, so I'd be very leery of causing other harm before you really got the oil out.  Besides that, the oil wouldn't necessarily even come out, but rather polymerize in the pad (like seasoning cast iron), and not really help anything.  If you're comfortable and competent to do your own brake maintenance, take the caliper off, take the pads out, and take a look at them.  you can lightly scuff them if need be.  But just as importantly (and perhaps more), degrease the rotor entirely.  I like to take the rotor off of the wheel, hit it with a scotch-brite pad, and then brake cleaner to get it squeeky, absolutely clean.  But, you could probably do pretty much as well on the bike with some bike degreaser.  Also, proper rotor designs clean the pads fairly effectively, poor rotor designs leave portions of the pads with buildup of dust from the pads, or just dirt.  That's a possibility as well, one that you can ascertain fairly well by looking at the surface of the pads."

bikewrench,3c56x1,DonOblivious,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:05:41 2015 UTC,Normally if shorter pads were required they'd be on the front to help clear the fork.  The other option is to go thin with the front pads.

bikewrench,3c5cnl,muchacho_loco,3,Sat Jul 4 23:13:23 2015 UTC,"Is your frame aluminum? I'm a big guy and I can get the frame to flex when I really push, for me this causes the cranks to click on the front derailleur in turns sone times."
bikewrench,3c5cnl,blanksamillion,0,Sat Jul 4 23:54:06 2015 UTC,"It's aluminum. I weigh about 190.  This just started though. The clicking isn't anything hitting the derailleur though, I don't think, and it's pretty much every stroke if I crank moderately hard."
bikewrench,3c5cnl,spectchem,3,Sun Jul 5 00:14:09 2015 UTC,"I'm getting this because my chainring is loose. So it's only in the largest front gear, but it is as you describe.   Fixing it is another issue ... I haven't figured out how without a chainring tool"
bikewrench,3c5cnl,WuTangDan,2,Sun Jul 5 01:26:47 2015 UTC,"Pedals, cranks, chainring bolts, derailleur hanger, seatpost, seat collar, pedal cleats. The list goes on. If you can feel it though, and not just hear it, my first guess would be the bottom bracket needs to be snugged up. Does it change at all based on how much power yer putting in?"
bikewrench,3c5cnl,WuTangDan,3,Sun Jul 5 00:20:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it doesn't happen if I pedal light, but if I pedal about... Mediumly (is that a word?) it happens more. I looked at the bolt and if I have to tighten it up I'll need to buy a new tool for it.  I guess this is as good a time as any to overhaul the thing, if I have to go messing around in there anyway."
bikewrench,3c5cnl,WuTangDan,2,Sun Jul 5 00:29:23 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Does it change from medium to hard effort? Or is it always the same when it does it?
bikewrench,3c5cnl,ancap-biochemist,0,Sun Jul 5 00:39:19 2015 UTC,"There seems to be a threshold where it starts, but after that it's about the same. (when I said 'more' i meant more often, eg, instead of 50% of downstrokes at light-medium pedaling, 100% at medium-hard)."
bikewrench,3c5cnl,SavingHawaii,3,Sun Jul 5 00:47:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah that would support the theory. You should pull off yer cranks and check that the bottom bracket is tight. That's the bearing part that goes through yer frame. Removing the cranks and tightening the BB both require special tools. These tools aren't needed often, but aren't that expensive either. If you think you'll only use em once, pop into a local bike collective if you have one."
bikewrench,3c5cnl,ancap-biochemist,2,Sun Jul 5 01:08:20 2015 UTC,"Assuming it is, in fact, the crank:  I get this on bikes sometimes after I've used them as commuters for about two years. The bottom bracket gets worn simply because of my form (I don't use clips, I'll stand on one pedal, treat the bike roughly, crash, drop it on its side, etc., mistakes happen and I'm a bit rough with my bikes).  What might have happened is the bottom bracket got a little worn, and then each time the bearings have to work under load there's a bit of cavitation that occurs (I know that cavitation has a different engineering meanings related to fluid dynamics but I can't think of what else to call the wearing of the bracket).  In this picture, on the far right, you'll see the bottom bracket:  http://mywheelsandmore.com/Images/bicycleParts/chainset/ISIS-bicycleCranksetStandard.jpg   On my bikes there have been worn sections of that metal (when I took it apart), and usually you can just replace the bearings and it'll be fine.  You'll need a crank wrench which you can borrow, rent, or buy. And a nut that I don't remember what it's called that holds the spline so that you can remove the bracket from the frame.  Be sure to grease and seal it up well.  Hope that fixes it.  I was able to ride around on a bike with the clicking noise for a good number of months before I changed out the bracket/bearings. Mileage may vary, but I doubt it will seize up immediately (or ever?), but try to fix it before it does."
bikewrench,3c45hg,turbochargedmonkey,2,Sat Jul 4 16:28:41 2015 UTC,"If it were me, I'd get some larger clamps, and think about maybe getting a new rack (although it may be equally difficult to fit if you don't buy one from a brick & mortar store). The clamp you're looking for is called a P-clamp.  Chances are you could bend the rack further without doing any damage beyond perhaps chipping the anodization, but I wouldn't want to suggest it without being able to flex it myself. The anodization or paint on aluminum will chip before you damage the metal."
bikewrench,3c45hg,howmanydads,2,Sat Jul 4 17:02:48 2015 UTC,"I can't tell from the pictures how you installed it at the fork ends. Did you already tighten the screws there? Did you use the front or back eyelets? Try installing the rack on the mid-fork eyelet first and see how they line up with fork-end eyelets and maybe add spacers there.  Edit: I turned the brightness of my screen to the max and was able to see that you used the front eyelets. Try the rear eyelets instead, put in a longer bolt with the mudguard some spacers/washers and then the rack."
bikewrench,3c45hg,john78901,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:39:16 2015 UTC,"You were right, the rack fits when I mount the upper screws first. However, on the lower ones, the rack really wants to go on the back eyelets, and there is the fender already with a mighty spacer.  It was all pretty tight with this rack, I didn't want to switch the fender mount, the brake caliper and QR skewer were in the way, and the rack's top was pushing against the shifter and brake cables pretty hard. In the end I decided to get a Tubus Tara low rider, much smoother and no issues fitting it, plus I think the lower weight is better for ride quality anyway.  Thanks for your comment, you were spot on and I learned something, even if I went with a different solution in the end!"
bikewrench,3c3ser,akoro,3,Sat Jul 4 14:21:22 2015 UTC,"Those cranks are a 130bcd, so chainrings will be rather plentiful. Im assuming, as Im not the most familiar with that generation, the front shifter is friction shift, meaning you dont need ramps/pins, but they'd certainly help.   Anything 39/53t 130bcd rings that are a bit generic should work. If your in the US, a distributor called J&B Importers produces Origin8 products, and there's bound to be something from them that'll work."
bikewrench,3c3ser,mudbutt22,2,Sat Jul 4 16:07:18 2015 UTC,"You can (slightly) overshift and trim back with a friction shifter, to get good engagement followed by correct trim. (Mechanical) indexed shift pretty much mandates some sort of front shift aid on the ring because the FD cage can't be made to reliably overshift and then fall back into a perfect alignment without frequent adjustment. Even where a trim position exists, it's on the ""middle"" side rather than the extreme top or bottom position where it would facilitate a shift without shift aids.   Exceptions: close ratio chainrings don't have nearly as big a gap to jump and so need shift aids less; however there's no real reason to have a close ratio crankset and indexed shifting since pretty much the only people riding close ratio cranksets nowadays are riding vintage bikes and would thus not be riding indexed shift on the front. Electronic shifting offers the possibility of rings without aids (or with significantly redesigned ones) since the cage can exert much more force and be made to fractionally and briefly overshift, as a friction shift user would do manually. I fully expect the next Big Leap in electronic shifting to be dynamic cage positioning (using, probably, a tiny imaging system of some description) to provide closed-loop control of chain and cage position.   That said: why would you ditch shift aids? Weight penalties on the order of grammes, in exchange for much more reliable shifting. Some sacrifice is made in terms of interchangeability, but drivetrains aren't really mix and match anyway: nobody expects a set of Campag rings to work ideally with a Shimano derailleur, and the major gruppos are well-enough understood by smaller chainring makers that they can produce rings with compatible shift aids, whether that means the fact that Q-rings have acquired pins and ramps since their initial appearance, or ultra-aggressive WickWerks ramps on their MTB rings. In terms of the impact on cycling in general, I'd say that modern shift aids are only a little way behind indexed shift - it's just a straight technological improvement."

bikewrench,3c1s2u,Nessus,9,Fri Jul 3 23:35:41 2015 UTC,"If it is a brand new bike and you got it bone stock I would chalk this up, 100%, to improper front derailleur alignment.  If the derailleur is aligned properly, the next culprit are the limit screws.  Once those are set properly, the next thing I would check is the derailleur housing - perhaps it is frayed or pulled through the ferrules (usually as they enter the shifter).   Once that is take care of I would pay close attention to the amount of cable tension required to move the front derailleur. I have encountered my fair share of front derailleurs that require a fairly slack shift cable on the small chain ring and then an incredibly taught cable on the big chain rings.  If none of this works, consider throwing the bike into the nearest quarry/lake. Be sure to let the rest of us know which one so we can go and fish it out later, fix the issue, and post pix here."

bikewrench,3c1s2u,cleansoap,3,Mon Jul 6 23:05:13 2015 UTC,"Quick thoughts before bed.  IF YOU REMIND ME I'll reread in ~24 hours and think longer and harder on this.   Is it common for a fresh out of box bike & parts to have this issue?   No.   If they meant the actual Bottom Bracket spindle, shouldn't they be able to tell the length by examining the part?   yes.   If they meant the shell, shouldn't they be able to... I don't know.... measure it??   Yes.  This is a binary question and can be measured for verification.  That said it shouldn't cause SUCK and DROP even if a 68mm shell where a 73 was called for OR VISE VERSA.   Is it common to utilize a spacer in this way?   I don't grok why they think a spacer is the cause of the symptoms.  This is one of the things which needs more digestion.     Will utilizing a spacer in this way accelerate the wear on the bike in any way?   No.   Is the SRAM Rival 50t ring actually superior to the Sugino Alpina[2] , as the LBS says, or are they replacing damaged parts with lower quality parts?   Not superior in any manner which would be causal to the problem at hand, and aesthetically inferior.   Should I be contacting the manufacturer?   At this point cutting out the middle man and at least trying to hear it from the horses mouth is valuable.  Just be sure you know what you're speaking of OR be willing to write down exactly what is said.  Exactly.   Are there any questions I'm NOT asking that I should be asking you, the manufacturer, or the LBS when I go in to pick it up? I'm losing faith in them, and I can't tell if they simply want my bike out of the shop because it is eating so much time that they aren't getting paid for.   This is another one which needs more thought from me, but in a nutshell the problem as you have described it so far including the fact it happens on ""the road"" and not on the stand is indicative of problems not related to chainline spacing.   And thus a complete and completely transcribed statement as to what the problem is needed so that if they are right we can look at it without playing the telephone game and say ""yeah, that's legit"" OR you can hold feet to the fire in the future.   What else should I look for when I go to pick up my bike?   Does it drop chain?  Does it contain the parts you paid for?  Does it work as perfectly as a new bike of this price should?  (damn good)   What precautions should I be making to ensure I'm not getting taken advantage of? Take it to another bike shop to verify the changes?   Nothing but the above."

Counting each upshift & downshift as 1 shift, I would estimate every 30-50 shifts, it would malfunction.  Though I watched the front derailleur shift about 30 times on the stand, I don't know FOR CERTAIN that it wouldn't happen on the stand.  Most testing was done outside of the shop."

Counting each up and down as 1 shift leads be to believe the ""malfunction"" always happened under the same circumstances.   What were these circumstances?  Did it fall inward off the inner ring?  Outward off the outer ring?  Inward off the outer ring?  Other?  Are we using terms correctly?    Chain suck as in the chain sticks to the underside of the chainring and wraps up and into a jam?    Chain drop as in the chain falls off the ring?  If so which?  Both?"

I was unable to tell if the drop was happening from the inner or outer chainring, unfortunately.  Out of 10 malfunctions:  5 were as this image of the first occurance, stuck in the front derailleur.  2 times the chain was stuck loosely on the chain stay. 2 were dropped onto the outside of the big chain ring on the crank.  1 time, it dropped half off the chainrings onto the inside of the small chain ring."

While I rode, I had to reach my right hand over to pull the shifter. Not cool.  LBS said, and I quote, "" I can't have my mechanic and manager spend any more time on this, we've already gone above and beyond by replacing with better(sic) parts. We gave you a functioning bike.""  I reiterated that I expected the bike to be the parts I bought and work perfectly without crutches.  Reached out to the manufacturer to get some clarification in the manner I indicated on the other post.  Handed it to another recommended mechanic in the hopes he can give further diagnosis.  Also contacted the manufacturer, asking for a new crankset, as the LBS broke the first one, or at least the large chain ring.

You could maybe polish it and then clear-coat it, and that might look cool, but it won't look like the chrome fork in your picture.  To get what you're looking for, you'd need to get the entire fork chrome plated.  I once had an old BMX bike where the chrome plating was flaking off, and a local shop gave me a ballpark estimate of $100 to re-chrome it, so that's maybe about what you're looking at for cost.  My fork was not lugged, and yours is --  I don't know if that might introduce any complications."

bikewrench,3c1kzo,tommywalsh666,2,Fri Jul 3 23:39:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, I suppose that's possible -- that they chromed the whole thing, and then over-painted.  I didn't think paint ""stuck"" to chrome plating very well, but I'm sure no expert.  You could try to remove a small amount of paint from an inconspicuous area to see (acetone will strip paint, but not chrome plating).  If your paint-scratched areas are old and haven't rusted, then you're probably right."

bikewrench,3c0iet,caffeineme,5,Fri Jul 3 17:32:31 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter.  Typically the rear QR lever is placed on the non-drive side, simply because in some orientations it could interfere with the derailleur, and because it would be a bit more annoying to open and close next to the drivetrain. Front QR is on the same side just for consistency (though some folks swap it to keep it further from the disk brake, same reason just makes it more user-friendly).  Just make sure the lever is facing more-or-less backwards when closed (so it doesn't risk getting caught while you're riding or walking your bike), and point the lever far enough up that the derailleur won't press against it when you shift into higher gears."
bikewrench,3c0iet,howmanydads,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:27:09 2015 UTC,"For bikes with disc brakes, the QR lever should be on the left side, same side as the brakes. When the lever is on the right side, opposite the brakes, the lever will be more likely to vibrate loose. Just check them for tightness before each ride to ensure there's no issue. Make sure the lever is substantially tight.  See here for a discussion of QR lever sides with disc and v brakes: http://www.kinetics-online.co.uk/uncategorized/disc-brake-safety-issues/  Edit: If your bike doesn't have disc brakes, then either side is fine."

Rear levers are usually put on the left to keep them away from the drivetrain (or disc brakes, but I don't think you have those), and then front ones on the left to match the rear.

You can scrub them in some hot soapy detergent and lightly sand them with some 220 grit sandpaper if they did get oily.   Also, I believe there are different brakes for road levers and mountain levers. Make sure your brakes match the levers. They pull different amounts of cable and won't work well if they're mixed.

As for getting that old one out, an LBS is your best bet. You can replace the allen screw, but that derailleur doesn't look in good shape to me."
bikewrench,3by1jt,fireanddesire,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:34:17 2015 UTC,Thanks.   I appreciated the info.   I would have bought a used one online or gone to the co-op but I wanted to ride around tomorrow for the holiday.   Neither option would have worked fast enough.   I will look for an original one online. That cake with the bike.   I did take the old one up to the handy bike shop and they helped me out with out with a quick replacement.

bikewrench,3bw0yn,xohcahtoa,6,Thu Jul 2 16:45:16 2015 UTC,"couple things:    the ""7000 series"" refers to the aluminum that the bike is made with. not the model name. also yes it is aluminum. and i wouldnt really call it ""vintage"" but i guess thats debatable. its not a fixie. its a road bike converted to single speed with a coaster brake. originally it would have had gears on it, because its a road bike. shimano RSX is an entry level shimano component group which would have included STI shifters, derailleurs, multiple gears, brakes, etc... there wont be any problems converting it to a road bike because thats what it always was. the rear triangle is spaced to accomodate whatever hub width it had originally. measure between the the dropouts. its prob 126mm or maybe 130mm. either way its not hard to find wheels for it. you only really actually need a new back wheel.  speaking of wheels, those Campy Sydney 2000 rims arent really that old. you could prob sell them for a significant amount. enough to finance your geared wheel set or something.  the frame isnt rusty. aluminum doesnt rust. the discoloring is from the bottle cage bolts or the embedded mounts, which are steel. you can clean that off. or just not worry about it.  the paint coming off is just a thing you need to decide. if you strip it, you could burnish the raw aluminum to be shiny. or you could repaint it. or whatever. personally i dont really see any need to do anything. a little messed up clear-coat here and there never hurt anyone. i think it lends character. but it really comes down to your opinion. bottom line: if you leave the paint the way it is, the frame will be fine. the only reason to mess with the paint would be aesthetics.    feel free to ask any questions about specific parts."

I ask, because starting a project like this will almost ALWAYS cost more money than buying a complete bike, and will definitely be more hassle.   The bike you have could sell as-is for enough to finance a fairly nice road bike of the same vintage, depending on your area and chops as a craigslist hawker.  What are your goals? If you change the crankset, change the bottom bracket to go with it. If you decide to add more cogs in the back, I'd stay unified in your choices for shifters / derailleurs / freewheel or cassette to make it easy on yourself.

bikewrench,3bw0yn,Zank_Frappa,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:38:38 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your region. Browse craigslist for similar bikes and try to gauge a range of price-points for bikes that are equipped similarly, in similar shape, etc.   IF you want to buy a vintage road bike, I would look at the shape of the bike and the components before I would look at the brand. My area almost always has nice steel club or team bikes from brands like Fuji, Specialized, Raleigh, Trek, Panasonic etc, and these bikes can be had sometimes in the $1-200 range."
bikewrench,3bw0yn,gootgen,2,Sun Jul 5 16:11:01 2015 UTC,"as an addition to what others have said: Get rid of the lithium grease. It is not good for bicycle components. The operating temp.s for that kind of grease are way more than anything the bicycle can produce causing it to be pushed away from the parts you want to protect and cake up preventing any sort of lubrication to your bearings, etc. I would recommend phil wood or park tools grease but I've heard the new WD40 bike line has good products as well. A good rule is if it's Lithium, marine grade or hi-viscosity you really dont want it on/in your bicycle."
bikewrench,3bw0yn,What_a_rubbish_user,2,Thu Jul 2 20:21:52 2015 UTC,Marine grease can be useful for press fit BB cups and adapters. That is about all I would use it for on a bike though.
bikewrench,3bw0yn,howmanydads,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:14:36 2015 UTC,"Marine grease is intended to withstand salty and wet conditions, not high temperatures or huge pressure such as car grease.

bikewrench,3bw0yn,howmanydads,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:43:21 2015 UTC,"Good to know. My personal experience with it, is that it tends to be too thick and just doesn't lubricate or wear as well. I can definitly see its use as a proctectant in extreme condition though."
bikewrench,3bw0yn,The_Westerner,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:51:53 2015 UTC,"First of all, what kind of brakes could/should I install? It looks like the bike supports a rear rim brake, but I'm not sure about the front.   The hole through which your front fender is attached can also hold a caliper brake. You'll probably have to move the fender mounting bracket to the backside of the fork, also a trick nut like this can make installation easier.  I really want to install gears. Are there any obvious problems converting a single speed bike to gears, like spacing or something else?  Your bike was originally made with gears, as the rear dropouts have a derailleur hanger. You may need to change what bottom bracket your have in order to get a better chainline (wider BB spindle puts the chainrings further out), but I wouldn't worry about that for now.   Also, will I have to buy new wheels if I replace the crankset to add gears?   Just the rear wheel. ~Your rear hub possibly supports a freewheel, so you might be able to put a 5-, 6-, or 7-speed freewheel on the back wheel and move some spacers around to make it work. That's really dependent on the rear hub though, and may not be worth the trouble when a decent cassette-ready wheel can be had for under $100.~  EDIT: Just noticed your rear hub has a coaster brake. Coaster brake + multispeed isn't possible, so nevermind. New rear wheel or lacing your rim to a new rear hub will be necessary.  Also, you don't necessary have to replace the crankset if you want to add gears. Are the chainring and chainring guard separate pieces bolted to either side of the crank? If so, that crank can take two chainrings. Also, many people run 1x setups: a single chainring up front with multiple gears in the back. This may be an effective way to save a bit of $ and retain some simplicity to your bike.   Also as you can probably see from the pictures, the chrome plating (if that is even what it is?) is peeling a lot. Is the damage irreversible, or can I fix that somehow? The bike would look so much better without the peeling. Maybe I could scrape all the chrome off and polish the frame up, or I could paint over it. I just don't know whether it would look any good.   Your bike is aluminum so it definitely isn't chrome plating, and it doesn't look like paint. It's probably just a clearcoat over the raw aluminum. You should be able to strip all the clearcoat (chemically, mechanically, or both), and finish it. Raw aluminum has a lot of possibilities, you can wire-brush it or media-blast it to an even texture, mirror polish it, and then either clearcoat it or leave it raw."
bikewrench,3bw0yn,s3rious_simon,2,Thu Jul 2 17:13:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you for all the answers, they cleared up most of my confusion.  I don't think I've tightened my the crank completely onto the BB spindle so I might be able to make that work. I'll look into either lacing the back wheel or just replacing both to install a freewheel.  I just checked and the chainring and the guard are bolted on exactly as you described! I think I'll go with the single chainring setup though.  Thanks for clearing up the chrome/aluminium thing as well, I'll try and strip it off."

bikewrench,3bvhyf,theotherdave,3,Thu Jul 2 14:16:15 2015 UTC,"I'd be more inclined to say that's more of an issue with product durability or build quality than anything you're doing wrong. You may be pushing the wheelset outside of its intended uses, but i'd imagine you'd experience more issues with dented rims, busted spokes and wheels that won't stay true well before you get into issues of physically deforming the seats for the pawls.

bikewrench,3bvhyf,D0rk4L,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:28:52 2015 UTC,I think the issues Easton was having were related to the bearings in the hub not the actually freehub body. I keep finding a lot of information regarding the bearing upgrade.

A double-wall 36 or 40 spoke wheelset in either 27"" or 700c would work, and high or low flange doesn't matter as much as spoke count. you might need different brakes for the 700c. One issue is going to be frame wheel spacing. Measure the distance between the rear dropouts. Most modern rear axles will be too wide, so either you need a vintage set or a hub specifically spaced for narrower frames."

Many rims have the same/similar depth (if I'm imagining your definition of rim depth correctly) and will require varying lengths of spokes.   If you want to replace your rim, get the exact make and model if you want to reuse spokes.   We go above and beyond with our spoke length precision (down to 0.5mm) but we also have 10,000 spokes in stock and two spoke cutter/threaders. You realistically don't need that level of precision, but it doesn't hurt to be reasonably close.

I see a few posts about on t'internet with people complaining that their new Ultegra is 'noisy'.  Perhaps that's just the way it is.  No-one else with a (non Ultegra) ten speed seems to do it though.  My crappy old 8 speed is quiet as a mouse in comparison!  It's not a really loud noise but it's certainly noticable, and pretty annoying.   Also, just double checked (again!) with my trainer wheel (which has a new Tiagra cassette) and the noise is definitely where chain meets chainring.  I've had the chain off before and spun the cranks with no noise so it isn't the bearings either ......"
bikewrench,3buunz,CapnScrunch,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:04:27 2015 UTC,"This may sound odd,  but I find that I get a slightly noisier chain when I measure and cut it using the ""big chainring-to-big cog"" method. If instead I size it by going over the small rings front/back and through the derailleur, it runs a touch quieter. The difference is that the chain is a little longer when cut using the ""small-small"" measurement,  about 1 inch.    I noticed this when I bought a used bike last year, and while refurbishing it,  I wondered if the chain had been sized correctly. I measured it big-big, cut off two links,  and on the first ride I noticed that the rear mech sounded louder."

I would suggest looking at the system as a whole to figure out why it is rubbing. I would not expect a different crank to illicit different result unless the parameters of the crank differ from the current crank."
bikewrench,3buunz,nnnnnnnnnnm,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:29:22 2015 UTC,"This is partially what I'm asking.  A few different threads I found on various forums mention that the 6700 series has different chainring spacing to the 6600, which might explain it, esp as the bike was designed to have (and was originally sold with) 6700.  Chain has been replaced due to normal wear, outer chainring has been replaced as it looked a little bent.  I could change the cassette I guess but from tracing the noise it very much seems to be coming from the chain meeting the chainrings when the chainline isn't straight, but in a combination where it should be OK (i.e. 39/25).  It's not derailluer rub.  I dunno.  I'm a bit lost at this point and the fact that this is the only part that isn't original 'spec' is almost the last option."

bikewrench,3bude9,stalealmonds,5,Thu Jul 2 05:51:26 2015 UTC,"There's two key things to consider when tweaking a derailleur; the limits stopping it's travel at either end of the cassette and the cable/spring tension. Firstly you should make sure your limits are OK, my method for this is to shift to the highest gear (this is minimum cable pull as the spring pulls it towards the highest gear). If it hasn't shifted then either a) the limit screw is too far in (test by trying to gently pull the derailleur outwards and see if it shifts) b) there's too much cable tension c) the hanger/derailleur are bent or d) the cable has too much friction or is catching at some point. Make an adjustment to the high limit screw if necessary, screwing it in limits the travel outwards, unscrewing it allows further travel.   To test the lower limit I grab the derailleur behind where it bolts on with my index and middle fingers and push the first pivoting section of the derailleur (relative to the bolt) with my thumb towards the wheel while turning the cranks, watching how far it can travel. If it travels far enough to shift into the lowest cog but not over it then you're fine - otherwise adjust as necessary.  Once you're confident with your limits, release all cable tension - shift into the highest gear, undo the anchor point that holds the cable, pull the cable taught and put the anchor back down. Now try and shift to your lowest gear, if it doesn't shift all the way up to the lowest gear or it skips on the outer edge of the lowest gear then you need more cable tension which you should add by turning the barrel adjuster the cable goes through counter clockwise. Turn it a quarter at a time while turning the pedals and observing the effects. Once you have it able to shift onto the lowest cleanly, click through your gears while turning the pedal to see if they all shift properly. If you spot any points where it doesn't shift in the appropriate direction or it's skipping then you should adjust the cable tension in the relevant direction. If it's not shifting up, loosen the cable by adjusting clockwise and vice versa.  If this doesn't get you shifting properly then your problem is more complicated. It could be a bent hanger, bad derailleur, bad shifter, bad cable, bad cable outer or the cable is snagging around the bottom bracket."

If you've had a crash, your bike has fallen over or anything has bumped against the derailleur it's pretty easy to do.

I know you've said you've gone through the ""typical procedures"" but if you've gone through all the steps in their specific order the problem won't exist short of a mechanical failure (of which we have no evidence for, especially when mid-cassette shifts are what are borked (which raises a different red flag but we'll cross that bridge when we get there))."
bikewrench,3brdlr,jeseely,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:20:36 2015 UTC,"I have not verified the alignment, but looking at your second link I adjusted the B screw after adjusting the cable tension so I wonder if that is what caused the issue.  Edit: The alignment looks good by visual inspection."
bikewrench,3brdlr,fergie,2,Wed Jul 1 15:42:22 2015 UTC,"If those are the gears that you typically ride in, could it just be due for a new cassette? Most riders tend to primarily ride in 3-4 gears out of the range, which are going to wear faster as a result. I know you said they visually look fine, but its pretty difficult to eyeball cassette wear in my experience."
bikewrench,3brdlr,Senior-Jesticle,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:44:25 2015 UTC,"I actually tend to ride in the three to four largest gears on the back since most of my miles are racked up with commuting, however when I go for a ride on the weekends this is right in the range of where I typically sit which makes it especially annoying. It's entirely possible that the cog simply is worn out, but it seems unlikely because of what I said above and also because I did not have problems with shifting between these gears just a month or two ago before I degreased."

bikewrench,3br8cm,howmanydads,2,Wed Jul 1 15:01:30 2015 UTC,"As u/Dork4L said, you have a zero-stack (aka. internal bearing, aka. low-profile) design. There are still two pressed-in bearing-holding cups, as opposed to an integrated headset where the cartridge bearings rest directly in machined rabbets in the headtube.  You shouldn't have to remove the cups for service unless they are damaged, all they do is hold the cartridge in place. Just wipe them clean so the bearings will sit true.   How should I go about removing this, and the other bearing (preferably intact)? Thanks :)   If you do want remove the cups, you can use a wide-bladed flat screwdriver (or a section of metal pipe that will fit) and a hammer. If both frame and cup are steel, they tend to rust together a bit and some force may be necessary. If either is aluminum, be gentle, you risk gouging either one. Switch off from hammering on one side to the other, since you're pushing it out at an angle you'll have to sort of side-to-side wiggle the cup out so it comes out more or less straight. This photo shows how, even though it's actually on a press-fit BB it's the same idea.  If you're unable to hammer the cups out with a reasonable amount of force, bring it to a bike shop. They have an expanding cup remover that contacts the entire cup (as opposed to the 1/4"" that a screwdriver contacts) and is gentler on both cup and frame."
bikewrench,3bte01,PM_ME_YOUR_BlCYCLE,4,Thu Jul 2 00:08:56 2015 UTC,It's usually the rubber seal on the hub rubbing/squeaking against the metal hub.  If you have rubber seals covering the ends of the axle just put a little oil or grease in there where the metal and rubber touch.  Could be other things too but it's a very common problem with new bikes.

My guess is that the hub just needs some cleaning and fresh oil.  If spares are needed, they are still available via ebay, worst case in the form of a donor hub.  EDIT: I overread the part where you mentioned that the current behavior of the hub started with changing the tire.  Make sure the hub is set up correctly (Cables tightened correctly, Only found a german howto), the torsion arm of the coaster brake is tightened correctly (if this is the version with a coaster brake), and the chain is tensioned correctly.  No need to even open the hub if it has worked before the wheel was removed."
bikewrench,3btc2s,nklim,2,Wed Jul 1 23:52:06 2015 UTC,"no problem. you got this. your derailleur mounts to the frame using an adapter claw  like this: http://www.firstflightbikes.com/_borders/RaleighTRRD.JPG   The adapter claw uses the ""D"" shaped nut, aka the ""bracket nut"", to position it correctly against the dropout/frame.  like this: http://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mIh63MNjOoFJpp06vwObpUg.jpg  (potato quality, you'll have to zoom!)  First, remove the wheel and chain from the bike.  Line up the adapter claw with the dropout so that ""claw part of the adapter and dropout are aligned. Install the bracket nut so that the raised ""D"" part of the bracket is nestled into the dropout. Tighten the screw, making sure to keep the claw in alignment with the dropout. It is usually easiest to loosely install the nut on the inside of the adapter claw before installing it to the bike.   Install the rear wheel.   To align the wheel correctly, bring the axle tight up against the adapter claw. When the wheel is aligned with the frame, there will be a gap between the axle and the end of the drop out on the non-drive side. (something like this: http://www.schwinnbikeforum.com/SLDB/Images/Gallery/SportTour/1973/73SportTour5.jpg ) This is ok. As long as you tighten the wheel nuts to spec, the wheel won't move. Be sure the the wheel stays in alignment as you do this. (I find it is easiest to tighten the bolts in quarter or half turns, alternating one side then the other. This will help to prevent the wheel from migrating slightly as you apply torque)  Install the chain through the derailleur.   And youre done. Take it for a test ride  Have fun!"
bikewrench,3btc2s,einsama,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:07:09 2015 UTC,"As a side note, you should get some washers for your axle nuts. The more surface area between the nut and the frame the better the hold in the dropout and the less chance there is of damaging/marring the frame."

I feel like it shouldn't be the chain because it didn't happen with the same cassette and chain on the old wheel. Double check that the hanger fastener is tightened as well.

Near the end of the 2000s, Shimano introduced 5600, 6600, and 7800 which were their first 10-speed groups. These lasted through the late 2000s and very early 2010s, at which point Shimano revised these sets to 5700, 6700, and 7900 which were still 10-speed but had drastically different hood ergonomics that look more like our current groups. These lasted up until last last year (IIRC), at which point 11-speed was introduced, with 5800, 6800, and 7800."
bikewrench,3bn1bp,DavyJonesLocker,8,Tue Jun 30 15:15:10 2015 UTC,"Probably still lots of dirt in the pins of the chain, and depending on how well you cleaned your drive train, you could still be picking stuff up from it. Check your rear der jockey wheels, stuff loves to build up on there and is easy to miss. If your cassette and chain rings don't look brand new you'll be picking up dirt from them as well."
bikewrench,3bn1bp,joshrice,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:42:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I tried to clean the drive train as best I could. Using stiff bristle brushes the scrub degreaser on the chain rings and jockey wheels and then a cloth with degreaser on it to get the cassette, in between the teeth and all that. I thought I had it pretty well cleaned out. So I'm guessing your right when it says it's coming from the chain. I'll give it another good scrub down in the next day or so and see if it's still happening. I'm guessing it might to a couple washed to get it all out"
bikewrench,3bn1bp,joshrice,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:57:41 2015 UTC,"If you have a chain tool you should take your chain off to soak in degreaser every once in a while. That really helps get the crap out.   That said, it doesn't need to be perfect. Your chain isn't going to stay clean for long anyways. Good enough is good enough sometimes."
bikewrench,3bn1bp,Drumfool56871,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:36:43 2015 UTC,"Have you tried the park tool chain cleaner? I feel like it gets in there pretty good.

bikewrench,3bn1bp,rayEW,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:28:39 2015 UTC,"Try using querosene, lots of it to clean up the chain. Afterwards use the degreaser, it will remove the querosene. The dirt and gunk should be previously removed by the querosene. After the chain is dry, apply lube. Never leave the chain without something oily for much time, as it will rust very fast. kmc has chains with protective rust coating, but they suck, Shimano chains rust easily but seem stronger  Thats my 2cents"

bikewrench,3bmtgy,TherapistMD,3,Tue Jun 30 15:47:07 2015 UTC,"I would use a Dreadnought File (curved tooth) on the post to de-burr it. It will be faster and the file will last for years.  With the file alone you will be able to get the post smooth enough to be safe. If you have a round file, you could use it to clean up the tube. Most of the gouging probably came from lack of grease and turning the seatpost to pull it out, so grease it thoroughly when you're done."
bikewrench,3bmtgy,dialectric,3,Tue Jun 30 14:45:03 2015 UTC,"In my experience, it's almost always a burr at the top opening of the seat tube, and it only takes a stroke or two with a file to get rid of. Whatever is causing scratches isn't going to be big; use a fine-tooth file and don't go hog-wild on the filing."
bikewrench,3bmtgy,pthu,2,Tue Jun 30 15:03:27 2015 UTC,"Its almost certainly the top opening of the seat tube (frame), not the post.  Once you clean that up, the seatpost scratches won't matter (the steel frame will just press down any rough bits).  I'd use a deburring tool to clean up the edges of the seat tube, and also make sure the corners are not folded in (which would take a file to fix)."

The seat post game is frustrating when you're starting out, there are some that just kind of fit like this one looks to be doing right now. It shouldn't be extremely hard to move and it shouldn't end up scratched from doing so. Check your post size vs the size specified for your frame."

bikewrench,3bmapx,billytheone,4,Tue Jun 30 11:00:29 2015 UTC,"Short answer:  Yes and yes.  Slightly longer answer:  Maybe- there's a cassette checker that will tell you but if the teeth on the cogs look worn out, replace it; depends on the chain but you will need a chain tool to cut out links."
bikewrench,3bmapx,icallthebigonebitey2,0,Tue Jun 30 11:14:59 2015 UTC,I can run through 6-8 chains at mating the 1.0 without issue.  OP best if you try it and take a look.
bikewrench,3bmapx,kinboyatuwo,6,Tue Jun 30 16:59:21 2015 UTC,"Replacing the chain is fairly easy. You'll need to make the chain the same length as the one you have now, but if you buy from a bike shop, they can size your chain if you either know how many links it needs to be, or just hand them the old chain. Installing a SRAM or KMC chain is easy, each one comes with their variant of a split link which you just engage and pull together.  When it comes to cassette wear, if your chain is at 1.0% wear, most likely the cassette is toast. You can visually inspect it though: look for teeth that appear too narrow or look like sharks fins. Note that many modern cassettes have an intentionally slope-toped tooth every couple teeth for better shifting.  Also, if the new chain skips when you put it on, it's time for a new cassette."
bikewrench,3bmapx,howmanydads,3,Tue Jun 30 13:42:49 2015 UTC,"Also, if the new chain skips when you put it on, it's time for a new cassette.   Right.  The proof of the pudding is in the tasting.  Preemptively replacing the cassette serves no purpose, nor does worrying about this potential problem.  If a new chain skips on a properly parallel and adjusted derailleur then look into the cassette.  Otherwise sleep the sound sleep of the just and forget about it!"
bikewrench,3bmapx,cleansoap,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:13:34 2015 UTC,"This. (Although you should size the new chain)  Replacing a chain at 0.75mm stretch is easier/cheaper than chain and cassette.  Once you're at 0.1mm, you're in for both items and maybe a chainring.  The pictures above show some fairly extreme cases of wear. Best of luck!"
bikewrench,3bmapx,insompengy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:18:24 2015 UTC,"I'd also like to add, if the chain is toast, and the cassette and chainrings have also been worn past the point of getting along nicely with a new chain, yet everything (old) still shifts and generally works well, just wear it all into the ground.   Only do this if all 3 parts are equally crappy, and it's magically still performing well. Even if you only get another few hundred miles out of the old stuff, that's a few hundred miles of wear you don't put on the new parts."
bikewrench,3bmapx,Sumpm,3,Tue Jun 30 16:35:12 2015 UTC,Recheck the chain with a ruler.

bikewrench,3bmapx,SgtBaxter,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:02:35 2015 UTC,Thanks I will give it a go then and look into getting the checker.
bikewrench,3bmapx,EmceeQubed,0,Tue Jun 30 12:22:11 2015 UTC,I would just get a new chain with a new cassette instead of getting a checker. You know when you need a new cassette without a checker ... that's when your new chain skips on your old cassette.
bikewrench,3bmapx,700x23c,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:47:19 2015 UTC,"Mechanic here. Our policy in the shop is to replace the chain and cassette any time the chain wear is above 75% pitch wear. The reason for this is that as the chain stretches, it wears into the teeth of your cassette, deforming them as well. This is the reason some people can run a drivetrain just fine at 100% without any issues: The drivetrain has worn as a unit.   If you replace just the chain, you may find that it doesn't skip, as your cassette may not be at that stage of wear yet. However, it is deformed to the point where you will be burning your chain out at a much faster rate thanks to the imperfect mesh."
bikewrench,3bmapx,mmitchell30,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:15:22 2015 UTC,"There's a whole school of thought that you should replace the chain and cassette at the same time because they effectively mould into each other after a certain time. Change one and you've suddenly got two parts that are different shapes and it doesn't work quite as well.  Changing both is an easy enough job, most chains have 'quick links' where you can do it with no tools (a chain tool is handy for sizing though). Changing a cassette requires a lockring tool, a chain whip (can be done with mole grips..just about) and a spanner and is as simple as unscrewing the lockring and sliding the old one off and the new one on."

bikewrench,3bnzdr,porcupinee,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:14:43 2015 UTC,"First make sure the wheels are properly centered in the dropouts.  If they're still rubbing the tire, adjust the pads so they're as high on the braking surface as possible without rubbing the tire.  Pads should be level (you don't want the front of the pad lower than the rear of the pad) and hit the rim at 90 degrees (they shouldn't be sloping up or down).  Edit:  Oh shit I realize you mean the caliper arms and not the pads.  How wide are those tires?  2.2? 2.3?

I have no problem going with a slimmer tire, but it doesn't stand to reason that's the problem.  The only thing that sticks out to me is that the front calipers have more sheer. I don't know if that's a term bike mechs use often. Ummm it's closer to 90° to the ground?"

bikewrench,3bm1fz,nhluhr,4,Tue Jun 30 11:12:47 2015 UTC,"If the bike currently fits you, it will be too long with drop bars, even if you use a shorter stem.  Think about the general positioning of your hands for drop bar use - the most used position is 'on the hoods' which is gonna be significantly further out than your current flat style handlebar - roughly half the length of the hoods plus the full length of the handlebar's 'reach' dimension (typically somewhere around 80mm).  You can't shorten a stem that much and still have a bike that handles reasonably well."

So I'm not sure who told you it was a cyclocross bike with a flat bar but the bike you linked is nowhere near that.  Not even close.  That bike has a significantly longer top tube, shorter seat tube, longer chainstays, shallower seat tube angle, longer fork, longer wheelbase, and higher bottom bracket than a cyclocross frame."

bikewrench,3bnsb2,WarHamster26,19,Tue Jun 30 18:26:15 2015 UTC,That is exactly how it is supposed to work. That is how the dérailleur keeps the chain tensioned even as the length changes due to the different sized gears.
bikewrench,3bnsb2,bikewazowski,8,Tue Jun 30 18:34:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is one of the primary functions of a derailleur.  In addition to moving side-to-side in order to shift, it also has to take up slack in the chain when shifting to a smaller gear, or release slack when shifting to a larger gear.   Shift through a few gears, and watch how it works.  :-)"

bikewrench,3blnwa,AustENTation,2,Tue Jun 30 05:49:51 2015 UTC,"Something is amiss. Take your wheel to a shop and have them check the dish on your wheel. If the wheel is dished properly, your frame has issues."
bikewrench,3blnwa,802bikeguy_com,2,Tue Jun 30 05:58:59 2015 UTC,"Pretty much leaning on the latter as I tried two wheels and flipped them around with the misalignment always to the same side and always present. I know that the wheel I'm primarily using is a bit out of true, I can probably mostly eliminate the rub by truing it but it's still going to be misaligned and probably still going to rub from a bit of flex."
bikewrench,3blnwa,JiForce,2,Tue Jun 30 06:05:29 2015 UTC,"Seconding possible frame issues. If the wheel rubs the NDS chainstay no matter which way you put it in, that sounds like a frame issue (because if dish were the issue, the wheel would protrude in the other direction when you flipped it.)"
bikewrench,3blnwa,Guyroscope,2,Tue Jun 30 06:23:12 2015 UTC,"you can test the alignment by running a bit of string from the rear L dropout to the front L dropout, look at the gap between the string and the bottom bracket, then switch to the right.

bikewrench,3blnwa,nhluhr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:25:33 2015 UTC,You need a frame alignment gauge and a pair of dropout alignment gauges to check the frame and dropout.  It sounds like your frame might be a little twisted.
bikewrench,3blhvq,mikefitzvw,7,Tue Jun 30 04:44:36 2015 UTC,"20-30 steel would be found only on low-end models through the 1970's, but into the 80's you'd really only see it on a brand's budget model or on dept. store beaters. The steel doesn't have enough strength to have thinner tube walls, and it's not butted either, so what you end up with is a very heavy frame. That said, steel is steel and the ride quality is going to be nice even if heavy. I had a 70's gas pipe single speed that I rode happily for a summer. Now, my town bike is full 531c (main tubes DB) and I also used a bike for a few years that was full DB Tange 1, and they were both a big upgrade. The Super Course has straight gauge 531 main tubes I think. Maybe a little heavier than full 531 and no butting, but still a really nice frame. If I needed a bike and saw one for under $200 I'd pull the trigger. Just make sure it fits."

As for other characteristics like stiffness, shock absorption, handling..  affected by other things like geometry. i dont know what you would notice and not notice in a ride, or if you would even care if you did notice it. All i know is that is pretty much a bargain basement frame and almost anything would be an upgrade"

bikewrench,3blhvq,cleansoap,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:24:43 2015 UTC,"Hey another question - what does this chart tell you?  It looks like a 531 Super Course (in 1972) was only a single pound lighter than a Grand Prix.  I'd have to splurge up to an International to get a fully double-butted frame, and those go for over $800 usually, and still only saves 4 pounds.  I wonder how much differently they would ride at those weights.  I've probably saved 4 pounds just in my wheels."
bikewrench,3blhvq,cleansoap,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:55:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I don't really ride bikes that old; bikes from the 80's are my thing. I think the 1979 or '80 SC has Suntour Cyclone, Brooks Saddle, 531 main tubes. It probably weighs at least 5 lbs. less than your bike. I've seen them around $200 on craigslist. It's a good buy."
bikewrench,3blhvq,buzzsaw_and_dynamo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:46:40 2015 UTC,No frame is going to save you 4 lbs.  Comparing the SC to GP you're comparing apples to oranges.  The SC has a heavier saddle and lighter rims.  Good luck mathing the frame weight difference.
bikewrench,3blhvq,takeshita_kenji,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:43:59 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm asking - considering I already have swapped to alloy wheels and a lighter modern saddle, what else is there really?

bikewrench,3blhvq,buzzsaw_and_dynamo,2,Thu Jul 2 17:33:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah the Varsity is a heavy bike.   Does your Raleigh have a sticker that denotes the type of tubing? Besides the composition of the steel itself, different tube sets are different shapes. This is def a factor when choosing what to ride on."
bikewrench,3blhvq,buzzsaw_and_dynamo,2,Tue Jun 30 05:14:26 2015 UTC,"Basically just this (top left).  I don't think the tubing is butted.  I'd say it has a fairly pleasant, lively ride, albeit heavy by today's standards, whereas the Varsity has a muted, dead ride."

bikewrench,3blhvq,cleansoap,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:17:11 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I love the Grand Prix as-is (including the vintage components, as they work very well), I would probably only upgrade to a 531 Super Course if I actually noticed an improvement in ride quality (and I'd swap everything over).

bikewrench,3blirn,mikefitzvw,2,Tue Jun 30 05:43:07 2015 UTC,You're not going to find a screw of that diameter as short as you want at a hardware store.    Either cut the current bolt to length with a hacksaw (since you don't have a nut to thread onto it in order to rechase the threads post sawing you'll need to be careful and prepared to take a file to the cut bolt in order to clean up the threads) or as was otherwise suggested buy some new brake hoods.

bikewrench,3bl1ow,azneinstein,7,Tue Jun 30 02:18:57 2015 UTC,"A crankset specifies a particular BB spindle length because that places the chainrings in the right position for both the derailleur, and to maintain a good chainline with the cassette. Usually ±2mm causes no noticeable issues, but anything far beyond that is asking for trouble.  Your best bet is to use the stock length BB (or almost stock length), and put on a smaller chainring. You may be able to find a smaller chainring to replace your large chainring, research what is available in that bolt circle diameter (ie. the spacing of the chainring bolts).  Alternately, a compact crankset intended for road use may clear the chainstay, otherwise you'll have to get a mountain crankset with even smaller rings, which may leave you with less-than-optimal gearing for road use."

bikewrench,3bj3qg,rootaford,3,Mon Jun 29 17:20:07 2015 UTC,"You appear to be describing multiple independent issues:  Chain falling (inward?) onto crank arms is a limit issue. (even though I can't see how you'd have the limits wrong with the above described methodology).  ""doesn't shift or doesn't sit correctly (mind expanding on this?) on shift"" sounds like a cable tension issue.  1 - Are you sure you have a 2x front shifter?  In the same vein you sure you are doing the full shift and not getting hung up on the trim 1/2 shift?  2 - Are you sure your cable is routed correctly over the FD?  I'd start over again from first principals and see what happens:  http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/front-derailleur-adjustments"
bikewrench,3bj3qg,cleansoap,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:29:45 2015 UTC,"""Doesn't shift/sit correctly"" elaboration: When I shift from small ring to large ring up front...it seems to shift over but the chain doesn't sit flush on the teeth...instead it sits kind of angled and once the full pedal rotation is completed the teeth either over shift outward onto my pedals or I luck out and it clicks back on the ring. It's about 80/20, 80 being it overshifting and 20 being that it stays on chainring. Adjusting the H-limit for the overshift causes the chain to never reach the large ring in the first place no matter how taut I adjust my barrel adjusters.  It's indeed a double shifter and the derailleur is a FD-5600 (made for 2x10). I recheck all my work 3x over and it's definitely not setup incorrectly to my knowledge.  However...I've never heard of pulling on the cable (assuming along the downtube) while adjusting my H-Limit screw, is this a common ""trick of the trade""? I could see this simulating the ""under load"" issue I'm facing."
bikewrench,3bj3qg,cleansoap,2,Mon Jun 29 17:38:16 2015 UTC,"FSA Vero Compact Crank   So square taper.  Your elaboration on the chain not shifting/sitting correctly sure sounds like it either overshifts or undershifts.  Overshifting shows again a problem with limits, and undershiting (again) shows a problem with tension.  Some more thoughts.  A system which inconsistently alternates between overshifting and undershifting makes me think there is slop.  Makes me think the playing field is shifting.    Is that FD clamp rock solid?  Are you using a shim?  Is this a braze-on FD attached to your frame via an adapter strap?  Is every single housing end rock solid?  Is there a burr at any single housing trimmed end?  Hopefully you haven't wrapped your bars yet.  Is that crankset on the bottom bracket properly?  I.O.W. are those chainrings parallel to the frame at all points in their rotation or is the crankset askew on the spindle?  Are the chainrings bent?   I recheck all my work 3x over and it's definitely not setup incorrectly to my knowledge.   I hear you, but like I said swallow the pride and the assumptions pride leads one to and follow that new set of instructions Without Skipping A Step."
bikewrench,3bj3qg,Stickytapemeasure,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:48:50 2015 UTC,"The reason it's both overshifting and undershifting is because when it overshifts I adjust the H-limit screw to compensate (1/2 a turn) and that leads to undershifting. I'll definitely give everything else a once over, it's a band type FD and the FD is definitely aligned with the crank. For what it's worth, this crank derailleur combo was working fine before I made the switch to 10-speed. My components before were as such:  Sora 3x9 shifters, Tiagra rear mech, 9-Speed SRAM cassette, 9-Speed SRAM chain, same front derailleur, and same front crank  The reason for all the mix-n-match was that the bike had been in a wreck that ruined the previous shifters/wheel/rear mech. So the owner pieced it all together before selling it to me. It rode great, but I've always wanted 105 shifters which is why I'm in the pickle I'm in now..."
bikewrench,3bj3qg,ThaGuySP,2,Mon Jun 29 18:22:32 2015 UTC,"turning the H-Limit screw shouldn't lead to undershifting. My bet it that the derailleur should be lowered on the seattube.  If you clamp the derailleur, you should fit the derailleur parrallel to the chainrings and just a mm or 2 above the biggest chainring. Like so"
bikewrench,3bj3qg,D0rk4L,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:00:19 2015 UTC,You are definitely right about the derailleur height. I went home last night to take some photos to post for some visuals and realized the derailleur was set to high at about 4mm. I lowered it and straightened it and set the limits and again...all worked fine on the stand. My success rate while testing it out on a quick ride around the block didn't prove to be as successful with the chain constantly undershifting. The undershifting causes me to turn the H-limit but now I'm thinking that I should tension my cable tighter instead of messing with any of the limits if this happens (since messing with the H-limit gets the chain to jump rings but also causes the overshifting). I'll give it another go tonight and post pictures hopefully.
bikewrench,3bj3qg,howmanydads,2,Tue Jun 30 21:24:11 2015 UTC,"You need to pull the cable while adjusting your H screw, that's how you adjust the limit without the factor of cable tension interfering.  It sounds like your tension is too low (if it's set just high enough to ever get onto the big ring on the stand) and your limit too far out (since the chain is falling outward).  Pull on the cable, and where the FD stops is where your limit is.  Screw the screw in until you hear rubbing when pulling the cable and turning the cranks, then back it out a little.  Then tighten the cable until the FD stays on the high limit when you let go of the cable.  At least for my 5800 I need to up the tension even more to get good upshifting - you can crank the tension way up and it won't fall off the outside if your limit is good."

bikewrench,3bj6se,55555thatisfivefives,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:32:08 2015 UTC,"Ok so to recommend a fork that will keep your geometry the same, we need to know the distance from the crown to axle of your current fork.  The axle is at the center of your wheel, and the crown is at the very top of your fork, where it meets the head tube.  What we need is the distance.  As you can see in this example, it's 372.5mm.  How many gears do you want to have in the front: one, two, or three?"

The previous ones use a standard 1 1/8"" straight steerer, so just grab whichever 1 1/8"" carbon fork meets your fancy.   Also in terms of small parts, you'll need a new star nut (can be ordered from Nashbar too) for the forks that have an aluminum steerer, and to transfer your crown race from your old fork to your new fork. Or just buy a new crown race and get that installed. They're cheap too.   For the price, I'd go with this guy or this guy. Note you won't need a star nut for the second one because that's a carbon steerer and comes with an expander plug."

Generic tubes are fine. Just read the size on the side of your tires (probably 700x23 or 700x25) and find a tube that says the same.   Seat opinions vary widely with personal preference. I personally like specialized body geometry seats, and you can sometimes pick up a good quality used one for around $25. If you want a specific color, origin8 has a wide range."

This situation I would get the make of the brake caliper and go from there.   Suggestion: Although its not bad, its not standard practice to take the caliper apart. They're designed to have the pads slide out rather easily. But, I like the tendency.

bikewrench,3bjd57,1speed,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:39:11 2015 UTC,"I like kool stops but they can be squealy at times. The compound feels a little harder than some other inserts to me, and I think it forces the pads to be toed harder to compensate. I like my brake pads to be toed only as slightly as possible because I don't like flexi brakes. I find the jag-wire pad inserts work really well, and generally don't need to be toed as much. Just a matter of opinion"
bikewrench,3bjd57,B1CYCl3R3P41RM4N,-1,Tue Jun 30 03:24:07 2015 UTC,Get the mold release off them and they'll be quiet. I use a little emery paper.

bikewrench,3bjd57,B1CYCl3R3P41RM4N,0,Tue Jun 30 13:59:48 2015 UTC,"I do it to all pads as they grip better. Takes ten seconds. For the same price KS pads will last a good twice as many miles as Avids or Shimanos. Avids wear the rim heavily in my experience. Prepping the pad is the smallest of hassles, but use what you like."
bikewrench,3bjd57,otterland,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:02:40 2015 UTC,"dont get me wrong, I recommended kool stops to a customer today actually, because they do offer noticeable improvement to stopping, especially in the wet, over a lot of other pads. That just doesn't change the fact that they're noisy as hell, which is the caveat I had to explain to my customer when I sold him a $30 padset. I've tried filing em too, it helps a bit, but the compound is just too stiff, especially with cantis on a steel fork. The jag wires and shimanos work just fine for stopping power with most rims, without that dreaded squeal. I too avoid avids, but I generally avoid avid as a brand overall anyway. They've just released too many questionable products for me to feel good about putting them on a bike"

My new favorite is ordering non recessed center bolts complete with all the hardware and taking the caliper apart and rebuilding it.  This takes a little labor but the result is good.  Good luck. Drilling the fork is also really easy.  Know it all bike shop guys will tell you not to but on a steel fork it's totally fine.

bikewrench,3bhjts,Bike-o-king,3,Mon Jun 29 18:22:25 2015 UTC,"Know it all bike shop guys will tell you not to   You know why? Because we get sued. The shop I work at used to help customers install bike carriers (on vehicle). Until one customer damaged the paint on their vehicle. To be clear, this customer installed it on their own and fucked it up, but they argued that since we had shown them how to set it up, and they didn't properly execute the procedure, we bear some liability.  There's a million creative fixes for any number of problems like the ops, but I've seen too many shops go to court over qr skewers improperly installed by customers to ever suggest they drill their for or alter a frame in any way.  The big worry would be drilling too big a hole. The same person who doesn't understand the 'open vs closed' label on a qr skewer, absolutely cannot be trusted to drill a straight hole that is also small enough to ensure the recession works.

bikewrench,3bhjts,randomusername3000,2,Mon Jun 29 19:08:03 2015 UTC,Very common. Can you take a PIC? Or see if a magnet sticks to the fork

bikewrench,3bh0r9,jhands,3,Mon Jun 29 03:44:09 2015 UTC,"Hub work is easy but proper tools are necessary.   Your hub could be Mavic, but is more likely Shimano. Could you provide a photo please? We can then direct you on the right tools & talk you through the procedure."
bikewrench,3bh0r9,glenelm,3,Mon Jun 29 03:50:57 2015 UTC,"Firstoff, the Mavic CPX22 is just the rim, and doesn't indicate anything about the hub. Considering the CPX is a fairly modern rim, there is a good chance though that the hub has cartridge bearings as opposed to cup and cone, which means you wont be able to adjust the bearings (the entire cartridge is replaceable). Servicing the freehub bearings is usually an exercise in futility, the bearings are tiny and usually quite difficult to put back together.  That said, there is one part of the modern hub which can still be serviced, which is the ratchet and pawl assembly for the freehub. Typically they don't require much work, unless one or more of the pawls are sticking, in which case the pawls and springs should be removed, everything cleaned, lightly regreased (excess grease on the ratcheting surface can keep the pawls from engaging), and reassembled. A tip I've suggested before for reassembly is to wrap dental floss around the pawls several times to keep them in the inward position, this makes getting the freehub body onto the hub much easier, and the floss can be unwrapped once the pawls are partially in the ratchet ring.  If you want to try to learn to service a cup&cone hub (it still a very useful skill), I suggest getting your hands on an older wheel, ideally something not worth too much. Start with the front wheel, it's a bit easier. Make sure you don't lose any ball bearings; get an old yoghurt cup or something to put them in as you pull them out, and work on a cleared surface. Also make sure to keep track of the order of any spacers or nuts on the axle, they may play an important role in centering the hub in the bike.  There is a bit of finesse involved in the final adjustment of the cones: often a wheel that spins well when off the bike will not spin easily when in place, this is because the cones get pushed slightly closer together when the quick-release or axle nuts are tightened. You may experience this yourself, just take the wheel off the bike, back off of one cone by 1/4 or 1/2 turn, and that will usually fix it. There's a perfect point where the hub has no play off the bike and the wheel spins freely on the bike, it may just take a bit of trial-and-error at first."
bikewrench,3bh0r9,howmanydads,2,Mon Jun 29 03:57:01 2015 UTC,"The hub has cartridge bearings.   The bike was ridden pretty hard all winter and spring, and there's been a lot of exposure to moisture.  When spinning the wheel, there seems to be a grinding on the rotation.  This is the problem I was trying to get at.  How often should cartridge bearings be replaced?  could the grinding be from ratchet and pawl?"
bikewrench,3bh0r9,howmanydads,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:07:03 2015 UTC,"When spinning the wheel, there seems to be a grinding on the rotation. This is the problem I was trying to get at.   Definitely sounds like a problem with the cartridges. Typically the main bearings (cup&cone or cartridge) are the first to have issues, as they're most exposed to the elements. In fact it's pretty rare for anything else to go wrong with a hub.   How often should cartridge bearings be replaced?   Whenever they start to feel gritty. If you catch it early enough, you may be able to pry off the seal, flush them and repack with grease and gain some more useable life. This doesn't always work though, but it's worth a shot since you're doing the work yourself (not worth paying a mechanic to do when new bearings are decently cheap).   could the grinding be from ratchet and pawl?   No, the only thing that would go wrong with the ratchet and pawl is a sticking pawl that doesn't engage. Usually only happens in quite old or high-mileage hubs, or ones that haven't been serviced right (wrong grease, too much grease). The freehub bearings wouldn't cause grinding that was noticeable, bad freehub bearings are evident when the freehub or cassette doesn't freewheel freely when turned by hand."
bikewrench,3bgi7k,listofdemands,-1,Mon Jun 29 00:48:36 2015 UTC,Sounds like you need to bleed the brake line. Easy job to do if you have a small amount of brake fluid handy.
bikewrench,3bgi7k,MrMoofMonster,4,Mon Jun 29 01:00:32 2015 UTC,"Hold on there.  Bleeding hydro brakes not a trivial job, especially if OP doesn't want to have brake fluid eat all the paint off his brake calipers and maybe frame/handlebars etc.  Are we even sure these are hydro brakes?  OP, see Park Tool: http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/categories/brake-service-and-repair  Figure out which brakes you have, then choose the appropriate lesson category.  Since it sounds like you have disc brakes, determine if they are mechanical (with an inner cable inside an outer housing) or hydraulic (with fluid in a hose)."
bikewrench,3bgi7k,cromulenticular,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:47:20 2015 UTC,I'll check it out thanks for that - I do have Mechanical Disc Brakes - should have mentioned that sorry!
bikewrench,3bgi7k,cromulenticular,6,Mon Jun 29 02:03:32 2015 UTC,"If you have mechanical discs, you should have no problems.    Take a 5mm hex/allen tool and loosen the cable pinch bolt at the caliper.  When it is loose, pull another 5mm of cable through and retighten the pinch bolt.  Then check the feel of the brake levers.  Repeat to adjust as needed.  Also, check your brake pads - if they are worn out, then consider replacing them.  When dealing with cable brakes, it is really easy to end up with a housing that has popped out of it's barrel somewhere along the line.  The most common place I see is at the lever.  Keep an eye out for that - if you are squeezing your levers and it's feeling scratchy or otherwise odd, double check the housing runs."

bikewrench,3bgdq7,StampCollect0r,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:06:54 2015 UTC,"That ""spacer"" looks like a chainring bolt.  If so, it is in the wrong place completely.  In any case, a spacer is not necessary to get your wheel aligned in the dropouts.  Once you get your chain aligned on the cogs, put the axle in the drops and adjust the QR lever until it is ready to clamp down.    With the bike upright, stand on the non-drive side of the bike.  Put your left hand on the wheel just above the bottom bracket, behind the seat tube.  With your left hand, center the tire between the chainstays and push it backward into the dropouts.  When it's centered, engage the QR lever with your right hand to lock the wheel in place."
bikewrench,3bgdq7,cromulenticular,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:10:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for your advice. Do you have any idea why my bike retailer might have installed them? They are a very reputable shop so I feel like they must have had some reason.
bikewrench,3bgdq7,buckarooney,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:45:53 2015 UTC,I think I figured out why. I removed them and now the fenders don't fit. Hmm.
bikewrench,3bgdq7,buckarooney,2,Mon Jun 29 02:51:54 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, and it's kinda clever.  The axle can be put anywhere in the slot - meaning all the positions are valid. But other parts, such as brakes and gear mechanisms, may need small adjustments to work best if the position is changed - and like you've noticed, fender clearance might not work at all. Clamping those chainring bolts there creates a stop. Some bikes have a small bolt that does the same thing.  Do you know how a quick release lever works?"
bikewrench,3bgdq7,arth33,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:12:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I used the lever to take the wheel on and off. I ended up just taking off my fender. For some reason I wasn't able to get the axle to sit well with the bolt in the way. I probably should have just moved it further away from the bolt in the slot, but I don't ride in the rain so I didn't really need the fender. It's good to know that anywhere in the slot is valid so if I run into this problem with future equipment I won't worry so much about the axle being in the ""right"" spot."

Wheels usually go out of true because of uneven spoke tension and the nipples vibrating loose at the lax spokes. I'm too OCD to no measure them.

bikewrench,3bfzfe,cromulenticular,7,Mon Jun 29 00:56:34 2015 UTC,"He's saying you didn't have any leverage over the cranks when your saddle was low, and therefore would be putting out a lot more power to the pedals with a higher saddle, making the harder gears feel easier. It's easy to check if the chain is on the smallest cog in the back, and the largest in the front. If that is true, there is nothing that would suddenly make it feel easier from a technical standpoint. Wear and tear will not make it easier to pedal, as long as your chain is on the smallest in the back and biggest on the front it's 100% due to body position and saddle height."

Then once you've done that for as much as you easily can with bare hands, pop back out the tire lever. Hook it on the rim, under the tire. Use the edge of the tire lever to leverage the bead over the rim and then into the bead well.   I started not knowing how to change a fucking tube last Thanksgiving. I have never damaged a tube through mounting it with a tire lever."

In this way your hands have more power, and it will surely get the tire over the rim."
bikewrench,3bdew7,DeFex,7,Sun Jun 28 04:09:04 2015 UTC,"The cable pull ratio is different: the amount of cable pulled per shift is greater compared to the old 9 speed stuff. What this means is that a smaller percentage of each shift is affected by things like cable friction and component wear/tolerances. So it feels crisper and generally behaves more consistently than its nine speed brethren. It really does make a difference in shift quality, especially when things start getting dirty. If you're mostly going to be touring, it might not be a big difference. I can comfortably say that the shift feel is much more positive with the dyna-sys stuff.  You hit the shifter, you hear and feel it move things around, and if it's at all adjusted properly, it just shifts. Every time.   For what it's worth, the xt level shifters have metal paddles and ball bearings on the downshift (thumb push) and can release two gears at a time on the upshift (finger pull)."

With more cogs per cassette the amount of cable being pulled per shift was getting really fucking small.  So small that indexing was becoming a pain in the ass due to random errors in cable/housing length/friction due to frame flex/ temperature/dirt becoming larger than the difference between cog N and cog N+1.  So Shimano, rightfully, broke backwards compatibility by increasing the amount of cable pulled per shift - and in doing so dramatically (50%) increased the signal-to-noise ratio of the shifting system.  Making shifts much more reliable and the need for fine tuning has been greatly diminished."

bikewrench,3bd6a7,besselfunctions,3,Sun Jun 28 03:04:36 2015 UTC,"The problem you're going to run into trying to make a 9 speed cassette work with 7 speed shifters is that 9 speed cassette cog spacing is smaller than the 7 speed shifters were designed for.  Essentially the space between each cog is less than on a 7 speed cassette so when the 7 speed shifter shifts the derailleur it's going to move the chain too far. You'll get a couple gears that work but most of them won't.  You could conceivably add the correct amount of space between each 9 speed cassette cog to make it work if you had access to some 3.22mm cassette spacers. Apparently SRAM 7 & 8 speed freewheels use 3.2mm spacers?  The best solution is like /u/besselfunctions said though, to just buy a 7 speed cassette and put a 4.5mm of cassette spacer behind it."

Since we ended up going with a R451 on the front, I'd just have to order one for the back and it should be a viable option. (Funnily enough, I had silver housing for the front cables and black housing for the rear cables, so the calipers match their housing, haha)  In the meantime, I've found Velocity's 27"" Aeros, which are fine by me. I already put in the Gatorskins on the current LP18s and, honestly, I kinda fell in love with the feel of them after riding around with the new brakes.  So the only remaining issue would be finding a hub I could fit in the back; and the FH 2200 or maybe an Alivio would fit the bill. It seems like since the FH-2200 is 8/9, I'd only need a 4mm spacer and then I'd be golden to pop in the 13-30 7 speed cassette, may require a new chain, but hey, new components at this level aren't very expensive.   But now that I've got it back from the shop (had to do some drilling for the new brakes), I can get pictures!

bikewrench,3bdbi0,FlatBot,5,Sun Jun 28 03:32:47 2015 UTC,"You could, but it would alter the handling capabilities of the bike since the fork that's on it is not suspension corrected. That said, I see Raleigh offers the same model with a suspension fork and I doubt they alter the frame in any way to accommodate the fork so it's likely you'll be alright with a hybrid-style fork. You can sometimes find inexpensive hybrid suspension forks around, maybe something like the Suntour NRX 700c or an RST Neon fork, they should run you under $200. You'd probably need to buy a new crown race for your headset too, because you can't always remove the old one from your current fork without damaging it. But they're cheap.  Make sure you get one that fits. You'll need a 700c disk brake fork with a 1 1/8"" straight steer tube. No more than 80mm of travel. Most hybrid forks run 50-70mm."

bikewrench,3bdbi0,Vojta7,0,Wed Jul 1 02:07:57 2015 UTC,"A ""rule of thumb"" is that for every 1 cm increase in fork height, the head angle slackens by half a degree. This bike has a fork with an axle-to-crown distance (ATC) of 42 cm, the rigid one (mentioned by /u/stravadarius) has a fork with 47 cm of ATC. That's a difference of 5 cm, or 2.5 degrees, or a change from 71° to 69.5°. This may not only affect the handling (slower steering, front end raised by those 5 cm) but it may actually be a risk for the frame, putting excessive stress on the head tube, possibly damaging it and causing an accident.  I agree with /u/Sumpm, get the fattest tires you can fit and run them at a low pressure (but not too low to get an excessive rolling resistance), also get some foam grips (I bought a pair on eBay for $1)."

I am a heavier rider and I can output a lot of power, so stiffness is a huge factor to me. It also really bothers me that square taper cranks are basically designed to deform themselves onto the taper, and that is the problem I have encountered with them.   That said, from what I am reading it sounds like the GXP and Hollowtech II brackets themselves are somewhat unreliable (though some other compatible external brackets are not,) as the external bearings tend to be more exposed to the elements than the typical square taper. A lot of people also said external isn't as ""smooth,"" but then, loose bearings are even ""smoother,"" so it obviously doesn't count for much. What is your experience with GXP so far?   Also, do you know anything about the Campagnolo power-torque cranks?

No they aren't. What makes you think they are?  The bottom brackets tend to be less durable than a quality cartridge bb, but the newer hollowtech II bb's are better sealed then they originally were.  External bearings aren't as ""smooth"" when you spin them freely, but since the crankset (with integrated spindle) is stiffer, the result will be still be less resistance while cycling, or smoother.  My experience with GXP: It's a good concept. installing it is very easy and it's very smooth. I had a square taper upgraded to a (used) Sram Red chainset with ceramic blackbox GXP bottom bracket. These ceramic bearings should be relubed regularly (once? twice a year? I forgot) and after every ride in heavy rain. But since it's on my nice weather bike that's no problem to me. If you get a GXP for a winter/all weather/commuter bike, don't go for a ceramic one.  My GXP chainset is better than my (very cheap) square taper, yes. But if your cranks are fine, just get the cheapest bb cartridge you can find. It's around 12 € in store where I live, so online it can be even cheaper.

bikewrench,3bc9tj,cromulenticular,0,Mon Jun 29 10:17:26 2015 UTC,"Do you ever see those posts on reddit where they make a ring out of a silver dollar?   What they do to ""size"" the ring is hammer the soft metal object onto a harder tapered stick, which widens it.   This is essentially what happens when you tighten an aluminum crankset onto a steel tapered BB, and this is why it is so difficult to remove the crankset after it has been installed - the crankset has deformed itself around the taper to provide solid contact.  And this is all well and good when you have skilled hands working with high quality parts, but every time you remove the crankset, for whatever reason, it still ""sizes"" the taper a little more. The majority of cheap bikes are assembled with low quality parts by, lets say, uncaring hands, so I have had a couple otherwise decent bikes where the cranks have needed replacing after only a few months. I like that the external brackets already have enough contact with the cranks due to their larger size.   Anyway, with the bike in question I need to update the bottom bracket and chainrings, so buying a whole GXP unit isn't drastically more expensive - the difference is as little as $20 or $30, which is nothing for the upgrade and added peace of mind."
bikewrench,3bc9tj,Stickytapemeasure,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:53:54 2015 UTC,"hammer    and   This is essentially what happens when you tighten an aluminum crankset onto a steel tapered BB   No it isn't. I don't know about you, but I never used a hammer on a crankset before. Not to tighten it onto the spindle anyway.   It's just plain wrong. Square taper cranks are not at all designed to deform. What can cause deformation of the square bore is eiter play between the splines, with rounding as a result, or removing and installing a crankset so many times you have indeed reamed the bore a bit bigger. The last part is no problem, but it could (after many many installations) alter the chainline by a small bit.   I like that the external brackets already have enough contact with the cranks due to their larger size.    What do you mean by that? (almost) All cranksets with external bb have some sort of interface where they attach a crankarm to the spindle, just like with square taper. Most of them have the spindle integrated in one of the two crankarms, so you only have to attach 1 crankarm to the spindle instead of 2 for square taper.  (Campagnolo ultra-troque uses 2 half-spindles that are both integrated into a crankarm. You bolt the 2 halves together instead of attaching a crank to the spindle.)"
bikewrench,3bc9tj,pear-trees,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:39:53 2015 UTC,"I mean, I will happily concede that you know more about bikes than I do, but if the crank itself is not conforming/deforming to the shape of the spindle, I don't understand:   The point of having a taper, as there is no other reason it wouldn't be square and untapered unless the point was to jam the spindle right the fuck into the crank arm.  Why you would need a mallet to get a crank arm off, as is often the case. If they were the same size, it would simply slide off when unbolted, as seems to be the case with GXP (which as far as I can tell are not tapered) How it would somehow bore a hole through repeated removing and reinstalling without deforming the existing hole just a little bit.   I would assume they designed it to work this way for machining tolerances, which were much lower even 15 years ago in mass manufacturing. I wasn't saying I used a hammer to put the crank arms on, but whether it be a hammer or a bolt, pressure is pressure, and aluminum is softer than steel.   But, anyway, thank you for the information!"

The good news is that the noise you have is not a bad one, and doesn't mean anything is wrong with the brakes. Avid/SRAM brakes make that noise when there is excess pad material on the rotors. However, there must be SOME pad on the rotors for proper operation/stopping power. I'm sure you noticed that your stopping power went down when you cleaned them. When it gets really bad, wipe the rotors off with alcohol - but yes, it will be back.  This is really a good news/bad news post: good, everything is fine, bad, can't do much about it.  I will, however, make sure to note that if the noise is accompanied by any shuddering or jittering, you DO have a problem (SRAMs current centerline rotors should not do this, however).

You won't destroy anything but if you can't brake it will be unsafe to ride.  http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/linear-pull-brake-service-v-brake-type  2) Is the chain actually switching gears? It is possible that you change the shifter on the handlebars but the derailleur isn't moving the chain onto another gear. Pedaling with your hand and switching gears with the bike on a stand or upside down will tell you if it is shifting.  3) I also only use about 3 gears on my commutes. It is mostly flat, the general advice if to pedal at around 100-110 rpm so a little slower than two full circles per second. I believe that is the most efficient but I am not sure about the why I just know it is often stated advice. So if you are pedaling quickly the whole trip you don't need to use extra gears just because.  I am by no means an expert but I know a lot of the basics.

You'd be better off trying to salvage a hub from a wheel with a destroyed rim.

bikewrench,3b93is,howmanydads,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:11:46 2015 UTC,"First off, it's great that you identified that the creak synchronizes with your pedaling, and exactly what conditions cause the creak. That really helps to narrow down the potential causes for the creak, as we clearly know that it's tied to the part of the drivetrain that rotates with the pedals.  A few potential causes:   Crank to bottom bracket interface. Since you didn't specify a bike, I'm assuming you likely have a square taper bottom bracket. Sometimes the bolt that holds the crank in loosens, and will cause creaking. If this is the case, tighten immediately, as riding with this too lose can damage the crank. Pedals. Pedals have a finite life, as they contain much smaller bearings than most other areas on the bike. First, ensure the pedals are tightened, as loose pedals could cause creaking. If they are tight, swap them for a different pair. Some pedals can be rebuilt if necessary, or at least packed with more grease in the hopes of extending their life. Bottom bracket bearings or threads. It's likely not the bearings if you have a decently modern bike, as modern bottom brackets are sealed and rarely need to be replaced. You can check by pulling the chain off of your chainring and spinning the cranks; if they continue spinning after you release them, your BB bearings are fine. Occasionally, the threads on a bottom bracket creak, the easiest fix for this is to remove the bottom bracket, clean and grease the threads, and reinstall it. I suggest also applying a bit of grease to the inside of the non-drive-side cup, to eliminate another potential point for creaking. Occasionally, it's possible that the motion of pedaling – transferring weight left to right on the bike – causes flex in the frame, or rubbing in the spokes, or somewhere else. That's a potential cause for creaking as well, and usually the hardest to find. Usually diagnosing this requires riding the bike on a trainer while a friend moves his/her head around to pinpoint the exact location that the sound is coming from. We know it's not the seatpost as it will make the noise when standing (ungreased seatpost tubes can creak, and will also get stuck), but perhaps somewhere in your handlebars/stem? Or a rack mounted on the bike?"

Somewhat. 105 has been around since the 80s and is still being made, and has seen a ton of changes in technology. Probably limits it to a sealed bottom bracket though.  Assuming you have square-taper cranks (Octalink is similar, may require a different size of allen key).  To tighten the crank bolts usually takes either a 15mm socket, or a 6mm allen key. Both bolts are normally threaded (unlike pedals or bottom bracket cups). I'd suggest removing both bolts and pulling on the cranks to ensure they're still seated. Since I assume you don't have a torque wrench: if you're using a small L-shaped allen key, really put as much force into it as you can before your palm hurts. If you're using a socket wrench, put a lot of force, but not everything you've got."

If you have a spare set, or can swipe some off another bike, it's worth checking. Good news is should you need to repack them, your pedals can be easily opened with an allen key in the dustcap.   No rack mounted, I've had trouble with the front wheel spokes breaking   What you say about the front wheel spokes breaking makes me wonder if many of your spokes aren't tight enough. When spokes aren't tight enough, the weight of the bike+rider isn't distributed across multiple spokes (actually, the tension is removed from the bottom spokes when weight is applied, but that's besides the point). Under-tensioned spokes also flex more than properly tensioned ones, which could maybe be a cause of creaking. Easiest way to check is to temporarily swap the wheel for another one.  That said, I doubt it's your wheel, as most times that a wheel creaks it will do so with no pedaling, just rotating."

In practice, the worst thing that actually happens is that the wheel gets cocked and rubs on the stay, which is no big deal, you notice the noise/friction, stop and recenter the wheel. Bikes were made this way for a long time without it being considered more than an occasional minor nuisance.

bikewrench,3b8we2,mesija_mesic,3,Fri Jun 26 22:41:40 2015 UTC,"Im going to guess you have a freewheel and not a freehub body with a cassette. This would be a great time to get a solid axle. Just about any bike shop should have these in stock and they will come with cones, spacers, and locknuts. You may have to mix and match some of the spacer bits for correct fit. I do this all the time. Cost of the parts should be $10-$15 approx. Get some new ball bearings while you're at it."
bikewrench,3b8we2,dura-ace,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:41:27 2015 UTC,"Yes it's a freewheel, I'm probably gonna convert to a solid axle. Thanks for your input and thanks to all the other repliers."
bikewrench,3b8we2,motorbacon,2,Sat Jun 27 23:15:49 2015 UTC,"You're almost certainly stuck with the diameter of the axle.  Finding all of the parts that make up an axle set (cone nuts, lock nuts, spacers, possibly dustcaps) that would fit with your existent hub in a different axle size is tremendously unlikely/costly.  If you somehow did find a larger axle set that fit your hub, you are still limited by the size of the dropouts on the bike.  Using a bent axle is going to lead to premature bearing and cone failure and eventually hub failure, as there will be no way to properly adjust the bearings.  Some will be too tight, others too loose, at any given time.  As to stronger, tougher axles, I dunno.  If it's a quick release axle (hollow), it's important to get one the right length.  Too long and the quick release won't lock the wheel in place.  Also if you're planning on reusing the cone nuts and locknuts, it's imperative to get the right diameter and thread pitch on the replacement axle.  24TPI, 26TPI, or 1 thread per mm are the usual thread pitches.  By the time you simply find one that will fit, there aren't often choices as to quality."
bikewrench,3b8we2,EmceeQubed,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:39:31 2015 UTC,"If it's a QR and if it's bent that's not exactly a huge deal. Axles are stressed in tension rather than compression. I would still get another one though, even though many people have ""bent"" their axles without realizing and rode back home just fine.   Hollow axles of the same diameter are stiffer in torsion but less stiff in bending. In torsion, it's mainly the outer diameter of the shell that determines its stiffness. The stuff in the middle has progressively less effect on torsional stiffness as you approach the center. In bending stiffness, the extra stuff in the middle of a non-hollow axle helps.   I don't think your problem is stiffness related in any case. Axles don't generally ""bend"" in use and if you snap your axle, you'll probably find that it actually had a small crack in it somewhere. More than likely there was a single loading event that stressed it past its limit or a series of loading events that lead to crack formation.   http://yarchive.net/bike/bent_axles.html"
bikewrench,3b8we2,MustGetALife,3,Sat Jun 27 05:13:23 2015 UTC,"You've the bending/torsion stuff back to front.  In bending, you have a (mostly) unloaded neutral axis in the center of the beam (hence tubes are so good structurally)  Axial torsion doesn't have a neutral axis.  The torsion in a neutral axle like on a bike is minimal. Its the shear and tensile loading which hurts."
bikewrench,3b82a7,vincemarotte,4,Fri Jun 26 18:47:31 2015 UTC,Force and Red 22 big rings now come with two drop pins and a plug.  You punch out the drop pin you don't need and put the plug in.

I haven't actually seen even a well-neglected headset actually be toast. Not saying yours isn't, but, if it can be cleaned up without any real pitting, it's just worth keeping. Not big on singlespeed, so, can't help with a wheelset. Once you pick a crank it will dictate the spindle for the BB. I'm 5'9, about a 30"" inseam or 80cm pubic bone height, I prefer 170mm crank arms for sure. For brakes, when converting an old bike with calipers there's rarely a better answer than a set of Tektro R559 nutteds. VO sells'em. Good brakes, and they'll let you do a 650b or 700c conversion either on most vintage frames. Or at least 700c, if it's the old 70's style with miles of clearance between the fork and brake bridge and the wheels. You'll lose a lot of braking power if you go 650b though (due to longer reach), so, probably just stick to 700c or 27"""
bikewrench,3b8vbu,zedmartinez,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:49:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Well, I say headset, but I mean this mess if you scroll down a little. I wasn't sure if I'd need to replace the headset cups or not to use a modern stem since what I'm replacing is an all-one-piece-of-junk. Also I kind of suck at terminology, so sorry if I'm calling it the wrong thing.  I'm 6', about a 30"" inseam (I know, weird stubby legs proportionately), so thanks for giving me a place to start there!  I'll definitely look into the Tektros. The plan is to roll on 700c, the bike's got so much clearance it isn't even funny. There's even eyelets for fenders, so they clearly thought space was important.  Overall, thanks a bunch!"
bikewrench,3b8vbu,howmanydads,2,Fri Jun 26 23:04:30 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with Zed regarding the bottom bracket (cup&cone BB are bombproof, so long as you're willing to source new ball bearings when necessary). You may be able to fit the spindle from 3-piece cup&cone English thread bottom bracket to your BB cups, but don't count on it. If you're able to, then replace the bearings with loose balls of the same size. As he said, crank manufacturers specify a spindle length for a crankset, try and get one within ±4mm. That said, for a single-speed you have a bit more leeway, as you can move spacers on the axle and re-dish the rear wheel to compensate.  For the headset, is there a reason you want to replace it? It's probably possible to take it apart, clean out the old grease, replace the bearings with loose balls if necessary, repack and reassemble. If you need to replace it though, Velo Orange is probably the only source for an affordable one.  For brakes, yep the el cheapo Tektros work as well as entry-level Shimano and cost less too. They're even dual-pivot!  Wheelsets, I'm not the best person to ask, but I've heard good things about the entry-level ones from State Co. and Eighth Inch."

I'll head down to the hardware store and see what I can get to replace the bearings. Thanks for the advice on spindle length! I knew I had some wiggle with making it a single-speed, but not how much or what was right. Time for a little more homework, eh?  For the headset, I've taken it apart and most of the problem with it is rust. I think I'll be able to make it work, but I won't know until I clean it up. The actual problem is me sucking at terminology and the old stem design is, according to Sheldon Brown, downright dangerous. So I'm trying to figure out what I need to replace there to make a standard stem work with these wacky French dimensions.  I like the Tektros. I know it isn't cool to do or anything, but I want front and rear brakes. There's a lot of gravel kicked out by dump trucks and stuff around here, and I want plenty of brake when I need it.  I'll look into the wheelsets, definitely. Thanks again!"

However, you can adjust the front derailleur (part that changes the 'front gear') cable tension yourself. It is too tight and therefore pushing too far out towards the big ring.   Now you know what the job is, the best thing to do is YouTube search it - far easier than trying to go off written instructions.  Good luck and enjoy the new bike."
bikewrench,3b5ot2,An_OtherGuy,4,Fri Jun 26 06:02:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think the FD is at fault. The chain shouldn't be touching it when seated in the chainrings. As the OP says the chain is touching the larger chainring when in the lower part of the block. Sounds like an alignment issue, perhaps having the chainrings move out a little by using a wider BB or spindle depending on the setup would help. Either way it sounds like a poor bit of design."

bikewrench,3b5ot2,An_OtherGuy,3,Fri Jun 26 10:36:40 2015 UTC,"Cyclocross bikes, especially lower-end ones running strictly road componentry instead of CX-specific stuff, have weird quirks in their frame geometry and setup that make components not play nice sometimes.   I'm guessing the Masi CX has a rear wheel with 135mm hub spacing and thus the cassette is further out from the center line of the bike than it would be on your average road bike. This would angle the chain further out toward the direction of the big chainring and possibly make it scratch, where it usually wouldn't if these road components were installed on a road bike.   That's my guess anyway.   Not much of a solution for this besides either avoiding the problem gear combinations or using a wider BB like suggested to move the crank out a little more and reduce the angle the chain is running at."

The new wheel has a 32mm cx tire on (Kenda Kwicker) and combined with the front gears intended for a 26"" wheel, it's quite fast. The bike had one of the slackest headtube angles I've ever seen so a degree or two less doesn't seem to affect it too much. I helped compensate by having a slightly chubbier tire up front (40mm Kenda Kwest, kinda terrible but I didn't know this when I bought it) and for the most part it handles as great as any 26er with commuting tires."

That said, should your QR skewer break, you could be in more trouble than if you had a better fitting axle.  If you want the peace of mind, you can replace the axle in your new rear wheel, ideally with one intended for a MTB rear wheel (~10mm longer than a road rear whee; axle). Solid or QR, doesn't matter.

bikewrench,3b32ds,ThanMan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:23:51 2015 UTC,why?
bikewrench,3b32ds,B1CYCl3R3P41RM4N,3,Thu Jun 25 17:49:59 2015 UTC,"Because it puts the least unnatural/most supported load on the bike. The rear triangle is more solid than the front fork. With the front you are loading all 20 lbs on the bottom headset bearing/race in a way it wasn't meant to be. The bike is designed to engage the road at 73 degree angle - mostly down, but also moving forward. The bike will hang steadily and securely, and will rest in the rear dropouts, probably even if you took the quick-release out. It's so much more friendly and less stressful on everything."
bikewrench,3b32ds,ThanMan,0,Fri Jun 26 04:32:59 2015 UTC,Unless it's a mountain bike in which case the angle could be anywhere from 73 to 65 depending on the bike which itself is designed for more abuse than a wall hanger can possibly dish out.

bikewrench,3b32ds,cromulenticular,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:34:36 2015 UTC,"Actually it's not. Bikes with slacker head angles are stronger in the headtube area in order to support the additional stress resulting from said slack.

bikewrench,3b5162,intelligenzbestie92,2,Fri Jun 26 00:55:31 2015 UTC,"Neither your chainline nor your pedal position will be noticeably affected by a 0.7mm spacer. Both are probably already off by at least that much. The only thing you'd really have to worry about is the side-load on your bearings. Most two-piece, external bearing systems have the ability to take up some amount of slack - IIRC Shimano uses a wavy washer and GXP uses a bearing seal that has a lip around the inner edge.  Such a small spacer isn't likely to cause problems, unless you're already compressing things to the limit. Checking this might be tough, but you might be able to feel the play when you remove the wavy washer. In the worst case, you could give the right side of your BB shell a haircut.  PS. Not sure about MTB's, but its common for road setups to have a tight clearance between the big ring and the chainstay."
bikewrench,3b5162,igiveyoumehs,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:09:25 2015 UTC,"Not sure we're thinking about the same bottom bracket system because I don't have any sort of wavy washer. It's just sealed bearings and a dust seal pressed inside a cup, and the cup is threaded into the frame. The spacers prevent the cup from being screwed into the frame as far. If I trimmed the 'right' or drive side cup I would move the crank closer to the frame.   I think you are totally right with regards to chain line and the unbalanced pedals because it really is a thin washer.   Since the spindle length is fixed, my main concern is that the NDS crank arm will not have enough spindle to slide on an get the safety pin in the hole. Any thoughts on the tolerance for that?"

Many times the chainring isn't perfectly round causing a tight spot/loose spot condition. The chainring could also be off-center.  Loosening the chainring bolts you can try to recenter the chainring.

Then spin the crank again and see if there is a tighter spot.  Repeat as necessary.  What you are doing is slightly moving the chainring to better center it on the crankarm.  By finding the tightest spot, you are using the chain tension itself to help force the chainring into the correct position.  If you resolve the problem, tighten the chainrings bolts and ride happy.  If it never gets better, then you have chainring that isn't round, or has improperly drilled bolt holes.  The only solution is to get a new chainring/crank."

bikewrench,3b4ow5,UkeOverThere,2,Thu Jun 25 23:07:39 2015 UTC,All those special ferrules are meant to protect the poly wound coating on your cables from fraying.  Failing to use them quickly results in poor shifting response.  Read the instructions and/or dealer manuals at si.shimano.com to make sure you use them in the right spots.  Quick summary though:  The long nosed ones go where cable housing meets frame stops.  The short nosed ones go into the shifters.  And you already have the little one in the rear derailleur adjuster barrel.

bikewrench,3b4ow5,conipto,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:12:12 2015 UTC,"You can definitely get a clamp adapter.  It's typically a plastic or aluminum collar that goes inside of the existing one.

You can search for Dura Ace 9000 setup, Ultegra 6800 setup.. they're the same, but all three of them (the 11 speed models in the current generation) are a little trickier to set up than your old set and forget 10 speed double.  Especially so with a narrow steel seat tube like you've got - you'll almost definitely need to pay attention to the supporting plate and set screw part, as your FD is going to have it's limits at the higher end of the spectrum compared to wider/more typical modern ones.  /u/nhluhr got the rest of your answers below... you MUST use them where you're supposed to and you MUST NOT use them where you shouldn't, in short :)"

bikewrench,3b3tor,bloodyforeigner,2,Thu Jun 25 19:10:36 2015 UTC,"Can you take a photo? My initial thought is that you may be using the wrong length of link wire, as you said:   The link arm ends about 5mm before the cable clamp, so it doesn't cover the whole length of the cable.   That shouldn't happen; the 'shroud' part of the link wire should cover the entire cable and rest against the brake arm. Are you using a link cable that came with the brakes, or an old one sitting around?    When I apply the brake, I can see that the brake cable is moving through the link wire.   This also shouldn't be happening. The link wire should have a mechanism to 'lock in' the cable that runs through it. You should lock the cable so that the link is in the proper position.   I then adjusted the fine balancing screws on each arm so that the tension was the same and both arms, when moved (without the link wire connected) have the same tension and spring back apart nice and evenly.   Adjust the spring tension screws once the cable is attached, and the brakes are roughly where they should be. Usually I center, tighten up the brake spacing, then re-center if necessary. Having the same tension on both levers when they aren't connected to the cable doesn't really matter, as that serves no practical purpose.   my Tektro Oryx (yeah, I know)   Nothing wrong with Tektro brakes. They're reliable, fairly lightweight, and tend to work pretty well. Often times I prefer them to the equivalent tier of Shimano. I almost always suggest the cheapest Tektro levers as an excellent upgrade for anyone who has a bike with old non-aero road levers."

bikewrench,3b3nsu,Sturmlee,2,Thu Jun 25 20:54:59 2015 UTC,"Yep, sounds like the indicator chain needs adjustment to me.  Likely your shifter cable has stretched (which is normal), and the result is a bias towards to low-gears.  In all likelihood, your tension needs to increase just a little to take up the slack.  It's a simple operation but easy to screw up, too, so if you're not completely comfortable doing this yourself (and it sounds like you're not), take it to a shop."

bikewrench,3b2h7k,TrentKama,4,Thu Jun 25 13:00:34 2015 UTC,"If you turn the shifter you put extra tension on the cable. If the derailleur and chain are on the low gear in front and you turn the shifter without pedaling (= dry shifting) the chain won't move, but it will put a lot of tension on the cable.  Does the shifter also slip when you pedal while you shift?"
bikewrench,3b2h7k,Stickytapemeasure,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:26:05 2015 UTC,"Ah, it's as simple as that. It was slipping while I was riding, so I would tighten it up at home and give the pedals a few spins to shift the gear and it would end up still being springy or too tough to move so I'd loosen it again, take it out for a ride and have the same problem. Hard to figure out without a bike stand to keep things moving while you work.  Tightening it up helped on my second ride today. It didn't slip, but it takes a lot of force(hand off the bar and wrench it) to get it into top gear. I suppose that's the nature of friction shifters though."
bikewrench,3b2h7k,txbikerider,3,Fri Jun 26 07:48:03 2015 UTC,"There is usually a phillips head screw on the top of the shifter, tighten a little bit so that it won't return to the starting point and you should be good."

bikewrench,3b36m3,black_goat_tea,2,Thu Jun 25 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"For makeshift wheel truing, I've had good luck using the brake pads as reference for truing. Using the adjustment screw I can bring the pads closer until one is touching the wheel, and with a ruler (or often by eye), I can adjust the brake pads to be centered in the frame (by rotating a caliper or adjusting the centering screw on cantis or Vs)  I find it's good to look for not just the spot where a wheel is most out-of-true, but also to try and observe for how long the wheel is out of true (ie. is it a small bump thats 3-4 spokes long, or a long bend that's more like a dozen spokes long). Sometimes, on particularly long bends, I'll mark the rim with a graphite pencil to better remember where the bend starts and ends, and to be able to check my progress after adjusting the spokes.  Also, if you're familiar with truing, you probably know this but when adjusting for side-to-side true, it's important to counter every tightened spoke with a loosened spoke on the other side."

Cranks are designed to fit a certain width of BB spindle in terms of overall pedal spacing as well as positioning the chainrings for ideal chainline. Your BB has a 113mm wide spindle, which is right in the middle of the range for common sizes, so shouldn't give you too much trouble accommodating most cranks.

bikewrench,3b08nk,MK_Ultrex,7,Wed Jun 24 22:43:17 2015 UTC,"That's a very unusual mount for the front derailleur, I believe it was used by Simplex back in the day. I think it fell out of fashion after the mid-80s.  Even though high direct mount derailleurs wouldn't exist until many years after that Bianchi was made, I suppose it's worth measuring on the off chance it could be made to work.  It's possible that an aluminum/carbon screw-in hanger would work, but it would have a tendency to pivot about the single screw.  You say the bike will not allow for a band-on derailleur, I assume this is because of the brazed-in bump. Perhaps a braze-on adaptor could be placed right above the brazed bump, and a braze-on style derailleur fitted in the lowest possible position in the slot? Alternatively, switching to a compact crankset would mean the derailleur would have to be moved lower and should give the necessary clearance for a regular clamp-mount derailleur.  Do you have any more info on the bike itself, ie. model, year?"

Once I got the new bearings I had a terrible time installing them. I highly recommend the tool from SantaCruz for pressing. I used a make shift carriage bolt with washers and spacers that fit through both bearings. Be careful not to pull too hard on both sides at once without bracing the frame against itself. I slightly collapsed the bearing housings and had to rubber mallet the vpp link quite heavily to get it back into position.

I have in the past reset the pistons and installed new brake pads but that was before they started having issues again more recently truth be told. I would think the pistons and brake pads wouldn't be an issue. Truth be told, not a ton but I can be very rough with my brakes so it wouldn't surprise me if that caused an issue.  My immediate thoughts might be a leak, as the LBS said, or the brake fluid needs to be chucked but the brake fluid should be fine. He just bled them for me about 2 weeks ago. It shouldn't be diluted at all. If it's a leak I'm a bit lost."

A lot of that, even the derailleurs, will probably work fine with some TLC and lube.  Though the rust is a little scary - if any water got into bearings etc., there will be some replacements required.

bikewrench,3azwd3,valgonzarp,5,Wed Jun 24 21:08:51 2015 UTC,"Caliper reach is dependent entirely on the distance from the hole for the brake mounting point to the rim of the wheel. Nothing else. If you put too long of a caliper in, you'll place the brake pads below the rim, where braking efficacy will be reduced.   Of course, if you change rim size (ie. 27"" to 700C or 700C to 650B), then caliper reach will have to be changed to compensate.  Caliper reach won't be a limiting factor in tire width, although caliper width can be (and there are extra-wide calipers made for fitting larger tires). Usually longer reach calipers are wider as well, so if you have the option between a 47-57mm caliper and a 55-73mm, it would be a good idea to get the 55-73."

bikewrench,3ayixh,D0rk4L,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:40:41 2015 UTC,"Do you feel like when you use one, you're potentially pushing it far enough under the tire to reach the tape? I'm not certain this is the cause, but it's a possibility."
bikewrench,3ayixh,bikejockey,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:42:37 2015 UTC,"i don't think so, but even if it were the case, this morning there were multiple spoke holes partially covered, with the tape moving back and forth. is there a trick to installing the velox tape that i'm just not aware of?"
bikewrench,3ay2rn,seager,7,Wed Jun 24 12:42:36 2015 UTC,"Mini-V's work great of adjusted properly compared to a set of low-end or lower midrange dual-pivots. High-end dual-pivots (like the new Ultegra/DA and top-end SRAM Red brakes) work better than just about any other rim-brake option. Mini-V's have to be set up so the pad is running very close to the rim in order to get maximum braking power/modulation. If you set them up with the pads about as far from the rim as you would with a dual-pivot, they'll be very spongy and won't have much power."
bikewrench,3ay2rn,stravadarius,2,Wed Jun 24 12:58:14 2015 UTC,"There are a couple different leverage ratios out there and my bet is you are using a caliper meant for the higher leverage brake levers but using the lower leverage lever.  For example, TRP makes two mini v brakes, the CX9 and the CX8.4. The 8.4 is appropriate for SRAM levers since the calipers arms are 84mm long.  The 9 is appropriate for levers like Shimano 5700 or 6800 since it has longer 90mm arms."
bikewrench,3ay2rn,nhluhr,2,Wed Jun 24 14:00:10 2015 UTC,"as to your last question, you won't die!   those salmon kool-stops come stock with (the already super strong) paul minimotos and i've yet to flip myself over the handlebars, unintentionally.   i actually prefer the modulation, stopping power (in the dry, not too much experience with them in the wet) of the minimotos with salmon pads to my modern ultegra hydro road disc set-up - not that the hydro disc setup is at all bad, the v-brakes with salmon pads are just that good."
bikewrench,3ay2rn,_okra,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:15:28 2015 UTC,"On of the differences between canti/V and caliper (dual/single pivot) is that in the former the fork or seat stay stiffness affect the braking firmness. If they deflect too much the brakes will be mushy. Too low mechanical advantage, which may be mismatched levers or too acute angle of the straddle cable (canti) may feel firm, but require a lot of hand squeeze. Finally, weak ferrules or damaged cable housing ends can also create mushy braking. The higher the mechanical advantage (leverage) of the brake and lever combination, the closer the pads have to be adjusted to the rim.  You shouldn't be afraid of strong brakes. Unless there's extreme non-linearity in the response (AKA grabbing) you should be able to brake the front hard enough to lift the rear wheel without going OTB. It's simply a matter of practice and something every cyclist should know how to do. Rear brakes are really only useful for redundancy, shedding heat on long descents, and in very low traction situations."
bikewrench,3ay73e,5839023904,2,Wed Jun 24 13:26:33 2015 UTC,The barrel adjuster is the way to go.  You may need to apply a few drops of lube to the threads.  Then there's adjusting the cable tension at the hub but that's best left to your mechanic.
bikewrench,3ay73e,icallthebigonebitey2,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:23:25 2015 UTC,have you worked with this specific one before? Did you use a wrench? The plastic adjuster just seemed so flimsy.
bikewrench,3ay73e,icallthebigonebitey2,2,Wed Jun 24 19:37:39 2015 UTC,"Haven't worked on this exact shifter, but generally all barrel adjusters are the same or at least very similar.  The plastic bit sits over a metal cup.  If you need a wrench to bust it loose that's okay, just don't apply a lot of pressure and don't strip the grip."
bikewrench,3awmfz,fischeai,6,Wed Jun 24 02:24:04 2015 UTC,"one of the qbp value builds from your lbs. The basic ones should be $50-$60 for the complete wheel. And if it's from the 80s, the spokes are not fine and it's very unlikely they would be the right length for a new rim anyway."
bikewrench,3awmfz,shittypromech,2,Wed Jun 24 03:43:31 2015 UTC,"Listen to this guy.  Your old spokes are unlikely to a) be in good shape, b) fit a new rim unless you find one of the same ERD (that is a good value.) Even then you'll be saving very little buying a rim rather than a complete wheel. Factor in cost to rebuilt (40-50) your wheel with the new rim (unless you have the time/tools/expertise) and the complete wheel is a better deal.  If you're not just buying a rim, then it matters what kind of hub you need if its the rear wheel: freewheel (5-7 speeds) or freehub (usually 8 speeds up, sometimes seven). Overall Velomine has great deals. If you're just commuting/riding around town the Sun rims will be fine and are very reasonably priced."
bikewrench,3awmfz,doebedoe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:04:03 2015 UTC,"Although, If op uses friction shifters its fine having whatever speeds, just need to match axle width."

bikewrench,3awmfz,Drxgue,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:35:39 2015 UTC,"Depends—what are you looking for in a rim? Definitely avoid any old/second-hand steel rims, which are heavy and flimsy. Mavic Open Sports are great rims and are about $50 a pop."
bikewrench,3awmfz,georgekeele,0,Wed Jun 24 02:52:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. $50 feels steep for me, I'm a poor college student and it's an old bike that works well enough (apart from a busted rim). I just need it to get me the 5 miles from home to school each day. Anything in the $20-30 range? I just came across these guys: http://www.amazon.com/Alloy-700c-CR18-Silver-Hole/dp/B000AO7EYQ/ref=sr_1_2?s=outdoor-recreation&ie=UTF8&qid=1435112929&sr=1-2&keywords=700c+rim Thoughts?"
bikewrench,3awmfz,miasmic,3,Wed Jun 24 03:06:39 2015 UTC,"My thought is that once you've bought that, new spokes and had it put together, you will have spent a lot more than $50...?"
bikewrench,3awmfz,Drxgue,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:13:47 2015 UTC,"Look on your local eBay or Craigslist for a whole replacement wheel. You don't say if it's the front of rear wheel. If the front, any old 700c wheel will fit and work. I can run a new $1000 a pair Ksyrium SL front wheel on my 80s road bike and the run the 80s wheel from it on my new carbon bike if I want.  If it's the rear, you pretty much just need to find any aluminium/alloy 700c wheel with the same number of speeds. I say pretty much as newer wheels the hub could be slightly too wide but they will still fit stretching the dropouts apart slightly (no worries with a steel frame), and you can have your frame 'cold set' to be permanently like that.  If you are a broke student imo you should set a budget of $30-40 to get a replacement wheel. Check out garage sales, municipal recycle centres etc, charity/pawn shops. I've bought rusty whole bikes for a few bucks to get spare parts, spare wheelsets etc."
bikewrench,3awmfz,bikejockey,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:47:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I'm a bit hard headed so I'm still gonna try and rebuild this thing, but its good to have these backup options."
bikewrench,3aw8ib,lavaslippers,6,Wed Jun 24 00:23:54 2015 UTC,"Pannier or seat tube, tucked parallel on non-drive side. Mounting to the fork is waiting for a disaster when it rotates into your wheel."
bikewrench,3aw8ib,55555thatisfivefives,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:27:31 2015 UTC,Good call. Thank you. I took another look at it and managed to find a place on the downtube. Hopefully this is safe.

bikewrench,3aw8ib,iceardor,3,Wed Jun 24 04:23:45 2015 UTC,"If you still have your old lock, drip some chain lube into the keyway and the portions of the base that secure with the U. You might be able to get the lock back to working condition. Never know when it might be handy to have a backup lock."
bikewrench,3aw8ib,EmceeQubed,2,Wed Jun 24 05:21:27 2015 UTC,"I had already been lubricating for weeks to try and alleviate the problem, but it was getting worse. It was very old and had been neglected outside by the previous owners. I am grateful to have been given it and used it for most of a year, but the mechanism was so seized that I only barely opened it that last time, and that required force enough to bend the key. Once open, I was relieved to not have to leave my bike on the mountain for the night, and I knew the lock would never open again, so I locked it and broke the key inside to prevent it being used. The LBS added it to their metal recycle bin.  You are right though, having two locks is a good idea. Eventually I'd like to get a higher model, and then this one can be the spare."
bikewrench,3aw8ib,EmceeQubed,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:27:11 2015 UTC,"Don't use wet lube, use pencil lead shavings, aka graphite. Wet lubes get clogged up with dirt. What you can do now is flush the lock with wd40 or mineral spirits. Let dry for a few days. Then spill graphite inside."
bikewrench,3aw8ib,tmwk,2,Thu Jun 25 02:58:46 2015 UTC,"The lock was far too corroded for graphite. I used penetrating lube, as that was the most likely to help. The lock has since been discarded, as it simply couldn't be expected to open again."
bikewrench,3aw8ib,tmwk,2,Thu Jun 25 04:47:21 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
bikewrench,3aw8ib,Synthacon,2,Thu Jun 25 07:04:55 2015 UTC,I've got graphite for door hinges. I'll remember to use it in the next few months on my new lock.

bikewrench,3awvbb,88point8,2,Wed Jun 24 03:42:34 2015 UTC,"there should be no appreciable wobble, ideally. the more wobble, the more likely the wheel will fail as there is more lateral stress on the rim."
bikewrench,3awvbb,uh_no_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:54:29 2015 UTC,Thanks
bikewrench,3awvbb,noburdennyc,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:55:17 2015 UTC,more wobble will wear the brakes unnecessarily as well.
bikewrench,3awvbb,jgan96,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:57:47 2015 UTC,"It's possible that you have a broken spoke, have you checked for that?"
bikewrench,3awvbb,danny31292,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:15:38 2015 UTC,"No, I wouldn't think so. It my first time tinkering with the spokes so I think I just haven't tightened and loosened them properly. The wobble isn't very noticeable I must say, only through closer inspection it reveals that the wheel tilts just a bit side to side. That is why I asked this question on here, does it really matter if the wheels tilt side to side a tiny bit?"
bikewrench,3awvbb,danny31292,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:19:44 2015 UTC,"An out of true wheel can be safe assuming it was built properly to begin with. Another wheel can be equally out of true but have crazy uneven spoke tensions. That wheel could run the risk of breaking spokes or getting even more out of true.  The criteria for a rim brake and disc brake wheel are different. For rim brakes, you should be able to get the pads very close without any rubbing. For disc brakes, it does matter anywhere near as much."
bikewrench,3awvbb,icallthebigonebitey2,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:30:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I altered the spoke tensions myself , they all seemed to be very tight and now are a bit loose. Will the loose spokes effect the integrity of the wheel?"
bikewrench,3awvbb,icallthebigonebitey2,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:47:52 2015 UTC,You should be fine as long as you didn't go crazy but a shop should be able to true it properly for under $20
bikewrench,3awtp0,ttoorreezz,2,Wed Jun 24 03:27:33 2015 UTC,"Don't go anywhere near the Comps, the paired spoke design along with bladed spokes are a massive pain in the ass to keep true. (not to mention extremely outdated for performance applications) The Pros seem like they'd be more robust with 32/36 normal straight spokes. Radial lacing on the front is a bit racy for a commuter but not too out there as long as you're not a clydesdale. It's hard to tell how the rear is laced in the picture but I'm pretty sure it's 3-cross which is the gold standard. I bet they're pretty hastily machine built however and as such a solid retensioning and application of spoke freeze would be a very good investment in long term performance."
bikewrench,3awtp0,dokydoky,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:13:15 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I was siding towards the Comp wheels since they come with tubes and tires. I'll avoid em
bikewrench,3awtp0,nhluhr,2,Wed Jun 24 17:52:15 2015 UTC,"wow.  Those might be the heaviest wheels I've ever seen.  Also that glop of grease around the freehub hints at it not being sealed well at all.  I wouldn't put these on my bike but if it's just to get an old steel bike rolling they should function.  Question though, you say ""old steel frame"".  Are you sure of the OLD dimensions you need on that old frame?  That rear wheel is going to be 130mm."
bikewrench,3awtp0,nhluhr,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:26:12 2015 UTC,Are you saying that the two flanges that the rear wheel bolts onto need to be 130mm apart? That sounds pretty wide. What do I need to check to see if they'll fit?
bikewrench,3au96o,fw1620,11,Tue Jun 23 15:38:26 2015 UTC,your spokes are breaking because once you break more than a couple of spokes it overloads the tension on all the rest of the spokes and eventually they will all break. i would either re lace the whole wheel if you have the know how or just buy a new wheel.
bikewrench,3au96o,12_inch_richard,10,Tue Jun 23 16:24:58 2015 UTC,Tell the LBS the costs are killing you and ask them if they have a second hand wheel. You might get lucky
bikewrench,3au96o,MustGetALife,2,Tue Jun 23 18:29:05 2015 UTC,"good thinking , thanks"
bikewrench,3au96o,dialectric,6,Tue Jun 23 19:47:22 2015 UTC,"Do you have a bike co-op near you? If they sell parts, they probably have a used wheel for under $40, and would help you get it set for your bike. Truing up a used wheel is a lot less work than a rebuild."
bikewrench,3au96o,baklazhan,5,Tue Jun 23 17:25:00 2015 UTC,"$30 per go adds up fast. I'd get a spoke wrench ($8?), a bunch of spokes ($1/per?) and try to do it myself. If you break a spoke, just stick a new one in and tighten it up to about the same as the rest. I didn't even take off the tire, just reused the old nipple. If it's out of true, tighten the appropriate spokes a bit. I replaced about a dozen spokes like that over time. Eventually I took it in and asked them to do it-- come to think of it, I haven't broken a spoke in a while, so they probably did a better job! But it worked."
bikewrench,3au96o,Sophrosynic,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:10:49 2015 UTC,"More importantly, see if you can get a Park Tools spoke tension meter. They are about $80 new but maybe you can get one second hand. Get the wheel trued AND evenly tensioned, and your problems should go away."
bikewrench,3au96o,backgammon_no,2,Wed Jun 24 01:18:13 2015 UTC,On a budget you can just pluck the spokes like guitar strings to guage the tension.
bikewrench,3au96o,bigfinnrider,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:40:05 2015 UTC,You also need the tools to take a cassette/freewheel off to do the driveside spokes.
bikewrench,3au96o,ClintBeestwood,3,Sun Jun 28 23:44:16 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned that after you break 3 or more spokes your rim and remaining spokes are pretty much shot. You need a new wheel. I would just go to a bike co-op or again, like someone mentioned, ask if the shop has a second hand wheel they would be willing to part with. I wouldn't waste the money trying to build yourself a wheel. You'll end up spending money on materials and do a poor job due to lack of proper tools (spoke wrench, truing stand, tensiometer) or knowledge (lacing, prep, tensioning, truing) which will result in the same predicament you're in now in the future."
bikewrench,3au96o,dura-ace,3,Tue Jun 23 22:22:38 2015 UTC,"The biggest question not asked, is the wheel worth it? Have you been replacing the spokes(?), or has your LBS done the work? 3 spokes x $30 each time = $90 or the cost of a basic double walled rear wheel.  At this stage Id suggest tossing the old wheel and invest in a new one. 36 spoke count at a minimum but look into rear wheels for tandem bikes. Those fuckers WILL NOT BREAK!  Good luck."
bikewrench,3au96o,Nickerdos,2,Wed Jun 24 00:42:06 2015 UTC,Try to rebuild the wheel first. Bring it in to get trued up.
bikewrench,3au96o,anonanon1313,2,Tue Jun 23 15:41:04 2015 UTC,"Unless the spokes are defective, or damaged (like physically nicked by a chain), the reason they are failing is from metal fatigue. Normally spokes don't get fatigued. The reason for fatigue in most spoke failures is poor wheel build, particularly not stress relieving and correcting the spoke line. This is easily done by squeezing opposing pairs of spokes. See Sheldon Brown's article on wheel building, the stress relief section. It literally takes a few minutes per wheel, although you may have to do some touch up trying.  Once the wheels have been stress relieved they will no longer be accumulating fatigue and may last essentially forever. You may snap additional spokes that are already close to fatigue failure, since this method involves momentary over loading. Just get some spokes and a spoke wrench and learn to replace them yourself. It's not hard. Depending on the spoke location you may have to remove the cassette. That's not hard either and the tool is cheap.  Shops that want to rebuild the wheel fundamentally misunderstand wheel building. If you can't do it yourself, at least find a new shop."
bikewrench,3au96o,55555thatisfivefives,3,Wed Jun 24 03:57:45 2015 UTC,It's up to you.  Get a good wheel and be done with this problem or keep paying for spoke replacements.
bikewrench,3au96o,MTFUandPedal,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:40:39 2015 UTC,"Why do they need you to leave it overnight to change a wheel? Am I missing something here?  Switching a rear wheel out is a 5 minute job, 10 if you include coffee making time. 1 minute for a front wheel....  Edit OK add a couple of minutes to swap tyres. 10 and some swearing if it's me doing it."
bikewrench,3au96o,TheSkoomaCat,4,Tue Jun 23 16:53:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe they have a tight schedule of bikes that need to be done? I know we always treated walk-ins at top priority so he'd be in and out as quick as we could change it, but maybe the shops he went to have a different view on walk-ins vs drop offs.  Also might have to order the wheel or get it from another store if they didn't have it in stock."
bikewrench,3au96o,JiForce,2,Tue Jun 23 17:54:42 2015 UTC,"New wheel + tire + cassette/freewheel.   Being in a shop is different from doing stuff on your own. On your own, it may only take you 10 minutes to switch everything from one wheel to another and so you'd consider it a ""quick job.""   Unfortunately when you're a mechanic working for a shop, there are 10 ""quick jobs"" scheduled for that one day alone (nevermind lunch breaks + walk-in work and writeups. A day goes by quickly.), so unless you have a good reason to prioritize someone over someone else, it's not like you can skip right to OP's bike and be like ""I'm gonna finish this guy now"" while you have 6 other bikes waiting for work who've been there for half a week already."

bikewrench,3au96o,howmanydads,2,Wed Jun 24 08:41:46 2015 UTC,"Would you be interested in learning to rebuild a wheel? It's not as hard as many sources make it out to be, and will probably cost about $30-40 for new spokes and a spoke wrench. I first rebuilt a wheel many years ago after I crashed on my commuter and destroyed the rim; with no access to my usual shop, I rebuilt the wheel on my dining room table and trued it in the bike (frame flipped upside-down, with some folding chairs to help hold it upright, brake pads acting as a gauge).  The most difficult thing is to correctly lace the spokes, it can be a bit tricky, but as usual, Sheldon has an excellent tutorial. Lace the wheel with all the spokes loose, double check your work, and then tighten them up.  Like I said earlier, a wheel can be trued in the bike, with the brake calipers acting as guides. Again, that same Sheldon Brown page has excellent advice. I find it useful to use a graphite pencil to mark on the rim areas which must be trued, it helps me keep my place as I rotate the wheel, and can be wiped off with my thumb once that spot is true.  One more thing, if you buy a spoke wrench, the Park SW-7 is an excellent one for home use."
bikewrench,3au96o,Remington_Underwood,2,Tue Jun 23 17:08:07 2015 UTC,Each time they tell me they found a few other bad ones and that I need a new wheel.    I think you should have taken their advice earlier.

bikewrench,3au96o,georgekeele,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:28:19 2015 UTC,"Uh, a cheap but completely workable rear wheel is less than 50 euros IIRC (from having the same problem a few months ago) - that's just the cost of going two times to the shop for fixing a spoke, and much less frustration. Myself, I bought a bunch of spokes at the LBS and a wheel truing rig, which cost me more than what the new wheel I anyway ended up buying had cost me. But then half of the reason I was doing this was to learn how to fix a spoke, in case of accidental breaks while touring.  To fix spokes which are broken due to mishaps are completely reasonable, but once they start going due fatigue, you either swap them all (rebuild the wheel) or get a new wheel. If what you have is a cheap machine-built wheel, the last option is really the only reasonable one - and as a bonus you'll also get new bearings etc.  Oh, and did I mention that a few days after the first (or was it second?) fix, several more spokes failed, throwing the chain into the wheel, almost costing me a derailleur.

bikewrench,3aviqc,Vojta7,2,Tue Jun 23 21:01:12 2015 UTC,"Usually just a small socket (8mm, possibly 6mm) and a vice to clamp the pedal if possible. The ball bearings in a pedal are fucking tiny though. In most situations the races go before the bearings, but because they are so small in a pedal, sometimes the bearings go first. Not many shops will stock replacement though.   Personally, the most I would do I crack them open just enough to load them with grease, and then ride them into the ground. As for the plastic cup, you will probably shred it as they are not meant to be serviced. If you have a nice wide flathead screwdriver, you could heat it up and stab the center. Let it cool for a minute and pop it out. It needs to be fairly wide though or you will just chew it up."

When pressure is released, the cable slacks and the chain drops.   When adjusting the cable, might sure your barrel adjusters are nearly the whole way in to begin, your housing ends are snug in place, and that all the shifter tension is released (in highest/smallest gear.)"

A polished bike will look bright and sparkly like it did in the store, but more importantly it will (allegedly) protect the paint and make it harder for dirt to stick.   And that last part seems to hold true for me: It keeps my bike looking clean for longer. And it makes it look a little cleaner as an added bonus. It aplies quickly, but I wouldn't buy it if it weren't for the discount.

bikewrench,3atsbk,Philip_Pugeau,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:09:03 2015 UTC,You probably wanna change both of those if you're gonna change either.  So don't worry about which one it is.
bikewrench,3atsbk,Counterkulture,2,Tue Jun 23 15:30:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe, if the cassette is worn it will dramatically shorten the life of the chain so it can be a good idea to replace both. On the other hand a cassette will last a lot longer than a chain so it isn't like you need to replace the cassette every time your chain gets worn."
bikewrench,3atsbk,cinemabaroque,2,Tue Jun 23 17:38:04 2015 UTC,Unfortunately a worn chain will eat a cassette quickly. A cassette can outlive chains IF you change chains before it's too late.
bikewrench,3atsbk,meuzobuga,2,Tue Jun 23 20:14:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is a good point, probably should have mentioned that in my first comment. As long as you're maintaining everything your cassette will outlive your chains, but if either your chain or your cassette is in rough shape it will quickly damage the other component."
bikewrench,3atsbk,cinemabaroque,5,Tue Jun 23 20:33:12 2015 UTC,"In addition to checking the wear on the chain and cassette, check that the chain is aligning properly on the gear teeth. You can use the barrel adjuster (located somewhere between the shifter and the derailleur) to center it. If you do have to move it, you'll need to tweak both the limit screws slightly, because it means the entire cassette is now sitting slightly left or right from where it was before, relative to the derailleur."

My LBS gave my road bike back after a service and I had exactly the same issue until I realised that they hadn't tightened the rear wheel quick release and the wheel was moving side to side. Yikes.

bikewrench,3atsbk,Stickytapemeasure,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:49:02 2015 UTC,What? I think a pro mountain biker will avoid having their chain on their largest rear and largest front gear. You do know what I mean by crossing the chain right? No chain is made to stand up to that kind of lateral strain.  If a pro mountain biker rode all the way down with a crossed chain I would not be surprised if it broke.
bikewrench,3atsbk,cinemabaroque,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:35:09 2015 UTC,"You do know what I mean by crossing the chain right?   You do know what I mean by 1X right?   In the case you don't, (instead of just not/only partly reading my comment): A 1X drivetrain has only one chainring in front and often a wide range cassette in the back. This means that indeed you won't ever find a pro mountain biker on 1X crosschaining (as that is indeed impossible). But this also means that when a mountain biker on 1X will climb up a steep hill, his chain will need to handle the same lateral strain as when crosschaining. And I think we all agree that a pro can put out a little more power than we can.   If a pro can put his power on a non-straight chain without snapping it, then so can all of us.  A picture from the salsa website  And a random picture showing the chainline on a 1X9"
bikewrench,3atsbk,Stickytapemeasure,0,Thu Jun 25 06:36:41 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure, but why would you bring up a 1X in a conversation about crossing chains? As you state it would be impossible to cross so I don't see the relevance. But yes, you are correct, a pro on a 1X or a single speed is not going to break a chain."
bikewrench,3atsbk,cinemabaroque,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:55:25 2015 UTC,"why would you bring up a 1X in a conversation about crossing chains?   Because cross chaining isn't some magical phenomenon that is deemed ""bad"" BECAUSE of the crossing parts. It's called bad because of the angles in the chainline that occur when cross chaining.   Now if you compare this picture with the one on this 1X setup You will see that the angles in the chainline can be even worse when on lowest gear on a 1X MTB than cross chaining on a road bike.  If a chain can handle the power a pro MTBer on 1X puts out on a steep climb, a chain will handle a cross chaining amateur no problem."
bikewrench,3atsbk,Stickytapemeasure,0,Thu Jun 25 07:12:03 2015 UTC,"I presume there was a compatibility issue between your old and new wheel which required a new cassette? Anyway, your new cassette is good, but you just need a new chain to match it. Don't hesitate, because running too long on the old chain could damage the teeth of the cluster.  There's a small chance that it's not adjusted properly, but I'm sticking to chain."

Depends on how deep you want to dive in.  But reading that bike apart, cleaning stuff up, removing rust, degreasing old funky parts, greasing bolts, etc... New chain, new freewheel, new brake pads, new cables and housing.  Those are all cheap.  The bearings all need servicing.  You'll need some tools (including some bike specific ones) to do all this.  The wheels are obsolete but oh well.  Unless they have trueness problems their main problem is that they won't brake well and it'll be particularly an issue in the wet.  You can live with that if you know the bike has limitations.  At a basic level, you could fix the brakes and drivetrain up (basically the whole list of new parts and some cleaning) but skip most of the bearings (or let a shop deal with them).  That would allow you to avoid most of the more complicated work and special tools.  But you'd want to get that dealt with as they probably need it and you don't really want to learn about the joy inherent in sourcing replacement parts for French bikes (hint: Velo Orange).  If you use the bike without taking care of the bearings you could wear them into ""needs new parts"" status pretty quickly rather than just ""needs TLC""."

From a practical point of view, you should think about whether or not this bike fits you. It's quite a large frame. I don't know how tall you are, but you might go through with all the work and get the bike back up and running, but you still might not ride it because it's simply too large for you. You should probably make sure that it's roughly your size if riding it is your end goal.  If you do pursue it, I second the ""join a bike co-op"" suggestion. You'll learn a tonne of stuff, have access to some tools, and most importantly, some people might be willing to dig into their old parts bins for you. It can be tricky to find older parts sometimes.

bikewrench,3asg51,levelsaddle,2,Wed Jun 24 01:50:27 2015 UTC,"lots of nice considerate posts on this thread, but what they're all avoiding is the fact that bicycles aren't cheap to work on as there are many specialized tools and parts required.  if i were you I wouldn't target to make it ridable, i'd just do a bit of cleanup with the intentions of making the bike more of a display piece on the wall.  You're just not going to be able to service that crank/bottom bracket in any truly functional manner without spending some coin on tools and replacement parts."
bikewrench,3asg51,WaywardTraveller,2,Tue Jun 23 16:40:07 2015 UTC,"No offense, but that is ridiculous advice.  Nothing about restoring this bike need be complicated or expensive at all, and requires very very few if any special tools at all. Absolutely perfect project bike for a first time restoration actually because it is old and simple."
bikewrench,3asg51,levelsaddle,0,Tue Jun 23 16:49:49 2015 UTC,yea.... that bottom bracket can be removed and serviced by any ape with a spoon.
bikewrench,3asg51,Bathorhythm,0,Tue Jun 23 18:13:12 2015 UTC,"Apparently, I'm going to be the only one here to upvote you and reiterate the point of not getting too involved in it.   Nice story, great of you to think about doing this to a bicycle to keep the memory of an old man alive a little longer, but the bike is not worth it.   I'm a very judgemental person, and anyone who thinks this bike is worth putting more than two hours worth of time into it is not very familiar with old bikes, especially mass-produced bikes with fancy sounding foreign names. They're usually the same people that think all Schwinns are ""good."" Bicycles like this represent a time in the 70s where bikes were waaay more popular than today, when having a ""French"" ""road"" ""bicycle"" was in. This bike is French, it does have road drop bars, but it was never a quality bicycle.   It's akin to modern ""bicycle shaped objects"" you can purchase at large department stores like Walmart for $129. Just because it's old and French doesn't make it special."
bikewrench,3asg51,fantastipants,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:44:13 2015 UTC,"I know you said you're poor, but if you do decide to buy tools and properly get into it, it can be worth it to jump in with a tool kit.  Much better value than getting tools individually, and it's so useful to come to a job and realize that you already have the right tools for it at the bottom of your box.  Sadly, while this would be great, I assume it's out of your range."
bikewrench,3asg51,Banris,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:34:22 2015 UTC,"OK I can tell you about the bike. Why? Because I have the same bike, (but i upgrade it). It's a 74 UO 8 seen here (http://cyclespeugeot.com/PDFs/1974pdf.pdf) Now one thing is save everything you can, except the stem they are called suicide stems since if you have one of the defects it'll snap off and impale you, and you really have no way of knowing if it is a defect one. NOw repair  Sheldons bocycle site is the best for older stuff, and you can get a lot online. If your looking to update i suggest  velo-orange site online but the stuff is pricey as hell so its up to you  Now note everything is going to be a french measurement on that bike, so it's going to make it difficult to restore , upgrade or fix since its not a common sizing used in modern bikes"
bikewrench,3asg51,nom_de_guerre_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:35:48 2015 UTC,that chain ring looks pretty rough. are the quick releases rusted shut or can you open them?
bikewrench,3asg51,NoImJustLooking,-9,Tue Jun 23 17:09:46 2015 UTC,New wheel set: anywhere. You can get a good hub set and rims for around $300  Paint: get some auto-grade paint and primer from Advanced Auto Parts and get some sandpaper on that. You'll need to remove the crank arms and cassette. Pretty cheap tools from Park Tool  Saddle: get a Scoop saddle. They're great and not too expensive.   The total should be around $500 or so if you do it all yourself. It'll take time but it's definitely worth it. Hope this helps!
bikewrench,3asg51,fantastipants,3,Tue Jun 23 04:11:47 2015 UTC,Are you sure he would need new wheels?  If the bearings are ok I would have thought they'd be one part that was fine.

bikewrench,3atlcj,Buck_Lee,3,Tue Jun 23 12:10:18 2015 UTC,"Sort answer - course you could.  You'd need to look into geometry and see what you can do to get your position right, but it's perfectly doable.  Wont be ideal on an aero basis but sure - no reason why not."
bikewrench,3atlcj,MTFUandPedal,2,Tue Jun 23 14:03:51 2015 UTC,"I did my first HIM (half-iron) doing something similar.  I ride a KHS Flite 500 (2013) road frame, and found that the road position contributed to massive cramping during my previous OD (olympic distance) sessions.  I threw a tri geometry together by putting on an old, reversible seatpost that looks like this, and complemented it with a pair of base and aerobars.  It would have been better if my stem was slightly shorter (the reversible seat posts puts your bum forward, opening up your hip angles and allows you to deliver power while in aero; but this was not enough).  Sure, it wasn't perfect but I completed my run with ZERO cramps, though I was flat out tired as my nutrition strategy wasn't nailed down properly."

bikewrench,3atlcj,WeeblsLikePie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:09:31 2015 UTC,"Well I kinda winged it.  I haven't found a good bike fitter here in Malaysia that doesn't charge me 2 legs (what's the point of fitting myself for a bicycle if I'm going to stop cycling, right?).  I just borrowed the basebar from my friends, slapped them onto my bike and got cranking.  During my intervals (building aero position muscle groups 3 weeks from race, highly not recommended) they felt fine, but I knew something was off after coming out of the water.  TL;DR: Do not race like I do."
bikewrench,3atlcj,tanyeehou87,2,Wed Jun 24 17:22:03 2015 UTC,"This is definitely possible, but do think about where you'll be riding this, because the typical way to do it is as /u/tanyeehou87 describes--a zero offset seatpost or a reversible one.  You use that to get your saddle position forward, then you can lower the bars.  This shifts the weight distribution of the bike forward, which can really affect the handling.    Purpose designed triathlon bikes handle this with either a longer wheelbase or a shallower headtube angle (see articles on bike geometry by dan empfield at slowtwitch.com for more on this).  You don't really have that option on a normal frame, so a road frame set up for TTs is going to handle a bit funky.  It shouldn't be a big problem, but I wouldn't go flying down hills on such a rig.  At least not until I had some miles on it and really a good feel for how it reacts."
bikewrench,3atlcj,WeeblsLikePie,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:12:41 2015 UTC,"Ahh that never occurred to me.   I was lucky because I was already able to do roller training in aero position , so I guess I had a step up on most triathletes.  And yes, do take some time to familiarise yourself with riding on aero, it's a very different game, just like how you went to drop bars from a flat bar but a lot worse."

New collars are ~$10 and new Campagnolo style bolts are not much more."
bikewrench,3at2ay,pigcupid,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:31:41 2015 UTC,"You can take a smaller allen key wrench and some crazy glue / epoxy and glue the allen wrench into the bolt. It will be awkward with the post there, and you will want to glue it in a position where it can turn 360 degrees. The bolt and wrench are junk afterwards, but you may save the post."

Only took 20,000 miles, 2 countries, 9 states, countless tropical storms, and at least 3 tornadoes!) and that most LBS are set up like American suburbs:  Good for recreational cycling, not much on the table for the commuter or utility cyclist.  I shouldn't have to pay an extra $400-600 and wait for you to set up a hack of a bike from a recreational bike with braze-ons to something that vaguely passes as a commuter bike, yet won't be nearly as vandalproof or convenient.  I should be able walk in and get a Batavus or a Workcycles or a People or a Linus or similar bike off the rack with all the kit I'm going to need for day, night, wet and dry conditions with or without a couple bags of groceries, some camping gear, or potentially something size of a microwave oven.  If car dealerships stocked themselves like bike shops stock themselves, you'd go on the lot and all they got are Cobra, Charger, Corvette and a few classic McLaren's, and a friggin' Bugatti Veyron...but they'll be happy to bolt on some extra seats or a pickup bed to the trunk lid for ya!"

bikewrench,3ary0i,zenspeed,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:53:34 2015 UTC,"After a little research, it looks like it should have a self extractor. Some close-up pics of what you have will confirm this. The 8mm bolts should be held into the crank by a separate cap that threads in over top of it, while still allowing the 8mm to fit through.  If this is what you have, then simply loosening the bolts will pull the crankarms off by themselves. It will require some force. Remember the phrase 'lefty loosey' and 'rightey tighty' , for everything except the non-drive pedals and BB cups (99% of them, since there are rare types that are CW for tight).  This means CCW for both sides ought to do the trick. Also, before pulling it off, remember to loosen the (red?) lockring on the inside non-drive (left) crank arm, that sits against the BB. It's a small allen bolt.  If you don't have the self extractor, you'll only remove the bolt itself, and the crank will still be on. You can't do any damage either way, by loosening it. Self-extractor caps are fairly common in a high-volume / high-end bike shop. If not, they can be ordered, just tell them what you have."
bikewrench,3ary0i,Philip_Pugeau,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:32:26 2015 UTC,"Nah, the self-extractor is gone.  Whoever owned this bike previously must have yanked it off.  I'll grab some pics later, but right now, trying my luck with an 8mm Allen key."

bikewrench,3aq968,mrFUCKING_COMPASSION,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:14:50 2015 UTC,"well, my best advice would be to take your rim/hub/tire to your lbs and they will advise you on what you need. butttttt.....  there are generally 2 types of wheels.  26"" and 700c. you will be able to find your size marked on the sidewall of your tire eg: 700X28c is what i use on my bike."
bikewrench,3aq968,Manezinho,6,Tue Jun 23 16:21:09 2015 UTC,"Defiently advise you to perches new wheel. A basic one ca be had for $50 ish and a decently strong and durable one around 70$-80$. The reason for this is because you broke your axel, their is a strong change you damaged your she'll inside the hub. If that happened, no amount of adjust g will make your wheel spin perfect and your basically fighting the clock untill your entire wheel is unrideable. Even if that's not the case, axel and overhaul with new bearings may cost you close to 40 or 50 bucks. Might as well get the whole new wheel and be smart."

bikewrench,3aq968,Manezinho,2,Mon Jun 22 22:01:58 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree unless the wheel is out of true or otherwise damaged. I see tons of those broken axles on freewheel hubs. The cups are rarely damaged so all you have to do is put in a new axle (10-15$) and new grease/bearings. If you don't do it yourself, labour will end up around 15$ too. OPs LBS can probably give him a used QR for free.  If the wheel is in good condition, it's worth the 30$."

bikewrench,3apfl7,-KhmerBear-,6,Mon Jun 22 12:52:31 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking that torquing it up a little might break the Loctite adhesion?   This is correct. Once loc-tite sets, if it is broken it must be replaced to maintain the same strength.   If you need to remove or re-torque a bolt that has had loctite applied, it should be removed, cleaned decently well (acetone on a Q-tip cleans out the threaded hole), and have loctite reapplied. TBH though, on many small bolts a thorough cleaning isn't truly necessary. That said, bolts with loctite shouldn't need retorquing, it's pretty much 'set and forget' unless it's a high-stress application (which bikes aren't). If you're worried about a bolt loosening, use a sharpie or some nail polish to make a mark on the bolt and the adjacent area, that way you can see if it is loosening."

bikewrench,3apfl7,owlpellet,4,Tue Jun 23 14:10:41 2015 UTC,I use Loctite Blue on rack and bottle cages. Set it and leave it. I don't use it on bigger threads like pedals or cranks.
bikewrench,3apfl7,JSteigs,3,Mon Jun 22 16:21:44 2015 UTC,Loctite-on pedals just sent a waive of pain and frustration through me.
bikewrench,3apfl7,roberto1,3,Mon Jun 22 22:22:08 2015 UTC,Pedals should be greased if anything.
bikewrench,3apfl7,nowhere3,3,Mon Jun 22 23:27:52 2015 UTC,"Threadlocker is definitely something you should apply to bolts that aren't making contact with a lot of threads and that you don't want to torque down on.  Lots of racks/fenders/baskets come with bolts that already have threadlocker applied.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't check them, but it makes it less necessary.  Threadlocker isn't a glue though and checking the bolts won't ruin it."
bikewrench,3apfl7,AdrianEvans,2,Mon Jun 22 13:38:24 2015 UTC,Depends on the type of threadlock. The blue stuff is most common. You can tamper with it (check torque) and it should still remain fairly vibration resistant. One tip is to have some on the thread on the outside of the fastening that's would have to pass over to work itself fully lose. Tightening wouldn't interact with that bit. (source: model helicopter building - and those things vibrate)
bikewrench,3apfl7,dirtisgood,2,Mon Jun 22 16:38:32 2015 UTC,"I use loctite on all my racks and bolts that I don't want to loosen up. (brakes, racks chain rings etc)  There is a blue and red kind;  just use the lighter strength one, I think blue.  I never had to re-tighten the bolts on them ever.  This is after years and years of having a bike rack on my bike. (5 + years) It works that good.   It is a set it and forget it product."
bikewrench,3apfl7,sirus_vonda,3,Tue Jun 23 00:10:10 2015 UTC,you should just stick to the way you have been doing things without the loctite to make things easier on yourself. I have never used loctite and I'm sure I dont check all bolts and fasteners as routinely as you do and I've never had a problem on tour or otherwise.
bikewrench,3apfl7,pigcupid,3,Mon Jun 22 13:14:52 2015 UTC,"This is bad advice, IMO. Many racks and fenders come with pre-threadlocked bolts, and virtually all installation guides recommend a variety of blue threadlocker for bolts which engage so few threads.  I have seen many, many bolts rattle loose because there was either inadequate torque, or a lack of a threadlocker applied. I personally pull the bolts on nearly every bike I work on, and usually either apply blue Loctite, or replace them with pre-threadlocked bolts."
bikewrench,3apfl7,AlainBienvenue,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:17:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not like Rainman about it, but things like my fenders and racks come loose pretty quickly.  The thing I don't get about Loctite is that if you're not checking them do you just wait until you've lost a bolt?"
bikewrench,3apfl7,55555thatisfivefives,4,Mon Jun 22 13:24:53 2015 UTC,"If things get loose quickly, I would make sure that the pieces and fasteners are clean, greased and torqued correctly. I have never had problem with fasteners getting loose after all the above were done.   Buy or borrow a torque wrench to learn the proper torque: tighten to proper torque with torque wrench, loosen a fixed amount ( like 1 or 2 turns ), make sure part is loose, tighten with regular tool by same amount as you undid. Repeat until familiar with proper tightness. Enjoy ride, free of worries about fasteners. Still bring tools: things might get misaligned after a fall or just need to be adjusted."
bikewrench,3apfl7,sebwiers,6,Mon Jun 22 13:40:24 2015 UTC,Bolts for racks and fenders are a perfect use for loctite.
bikewrench,3apfl7,roberto1,2,Mon Jun 22 13:49:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Anything like that (subject to vibration and holding a part that inherently wiggles) should be using some kind of locking fastener, and loctite is one of the simpler options in the long run."
bikewrench,3apfl7,doebedoe,3,Mon Jun 22 14:34:09 2015 UTC,In all my days I have never seen a loctited bolt come loose.
bikewrench,3apfl7,LoctiteBrandon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:29:36 2015 UTC,Another option is to try using beeswax on threads rather than loctite. You don't run into the same problems of breaking the loctite and it no longer working when re-torqued. I've used beeswax'd screws on racks/fenders etc through many miles of touring without much issue. Its a common recommendation by retrogrouches like Rivendell and Velo Orange.

You'll get the bars notably higher. Also, bars get closer to you as they get taller, and pretty fast actually. Especially since that bike has pretty slack 71/72 degree head tube angles. Try raising them first, that'll also bring them closer the higher they are. Then, if that still is too much reach, get a shorter normal stem, like and 80 or 90cm. But, the riser alone might do the job."

bikewrench,3arloa,dirtisgood,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:15:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry, haven't been on.   The stem on your bike has a 6 degree angle.  Meaning it is 6 degrees off the 90 degree angle of the fork. (ie right angle to the fork)  So if you look at your stem from the side, I will not be an exact 90 degree angle to the fork.  It will be either pointed a little up or down in relation to the right angle.    If it is pointed down, you should be able to flip it to get you more height.  You can find on-line tutorials on how to do it.  Look to the right and go to the park tools website."

bikewrench,3aphhh,D0rk4L,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:30:34 2015 UTC,"So since then, have you tried airing it up again and seeing if it continues to leak? You could try soaping up the entire wheel/tire with soapy water to check for air bubbling out."

bikewrench,3aphhh,howitzer1,6,Mon Jun 22 13:35:26 2015 UTC,Sometimes it just takes a day or two (and/or a second dose of sealant if you lost too much during the leaking period) to get everything sealed up.

bikewrench,3aphhh,tocan,2,Mon Jun 22 15:25:23 2015 UTC,"A trick that i always used to make sure that the tire bead is seated properly is to hold the axles and spin the wheel. if the tire looks wobbly in profile as it spins, then the bead is still unseated. You don't need to inflate the tire to dangerous blow-the-tire-off-the-rim pressure.Inflate it to about 20 psi and find the spot where the bead is ""tucked in"" looking and pull up on the spot like you are giving it a shoulder massage. The bead should snap into the rim channel."
bikewrench,3aphhh,nhluhr,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:46:22 2015 UTC,Make sure the tire bead is seated all the way. The best way is to inflate it with an air compressor. A floor pump would work on some rim/tire combos but not all.

bikewrench,3aphhh,leetpeet,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:57:12 2015 UTC,"ok well that's definitely a different rim than the one I found earlier.  Can't see any of the spoke bed from those pics though so no reason to suspect their Tubeless-Ready claim is off.  I'd suspect your tape at this point.  The tape needs to be from bead to bead but it should not ride up the bead hooks at all.  That and there should be no bubbles under the tape anywhere as those make places for the air to find its way past into the spoke holes.  All that said, you are using 2oz of sealant per tire right?  And you FULLY seated the tire - i.e. inflated it to near max psi and got it to POP into place and the tire looks nice and even all around as you spin it (no low spots where the bead isn't popped all the way up)?  Also, make sure to shake the sealant inside the just-seated tire really well, spin it at angles, etc.  The idea is to fully coat all the little surfaces where air can find its way through."
bikewrench,3aphhh,leetpeet,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:03:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, all of that, I followed Stan's instructions to the letter. The tape is the one thing I think I didn't get quite right during installation though, so if there's more evidence of a leak when I get home I'll be reapplying that!"
bikewrench,3apzu8,hugspanda,10,Mon Jun 22 15:51:53 2015 UTC,"At this point you've probably destroyed the interface between your bottom bracket spindle and the crank arm.

bikewrench,3apzu8,shimasounds,5,Mon Jun 22 16:28:08 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have to replace the BB unless there is damage to the taper (or to the threads for the crank bolt). A visual inspection after cleaning off any dirt and grease from the tapers will sufficiently show whether the square tapers are in good condition.  The BB spindle is made of rather hard steel (old cup and cone BB had the whole spindle heat treated as the bearing cones are machined directly into the spindle), and shouldn't be damaged by the much softer aluminum crankarms."
bikewrench,3apzu8,howmanydads,3,Mon Jun 22 16:47:30 2015 UTC,"Usually it is only necessary to replace the arm.

bikewrench,3ar7nm,B1CYCl3R3P41RM4N,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:24:27 2015 UTC,I don't see how a rubber brake pad would harm a plastic rim unless it got something stuck in it.

bikewrench,3aqrxx,Counterkulture,0,Mon Jun 22 21:44:23 2015 UTC,Hm....there shouldn't be any wiggle.  Assuming you're tightening the cassette lock ring properly it sounds like maybe your freehub body is a little loose.
bikewrench,3aqrxx,JoeJoeJoeJoeJoeJoe,0,Mon Jun 22 21:51:05 2015 UTC,Grab the inner ring of the freehub and the outer metal shell and see if it wobbles when you shake them separately.
bikewrench,3aqrxx,dialectric,2,Tue Jun 23 00:20:29 2015 UTC,Check the spacers you have in your cassette. Some are made of plastic and would cause the cassette to wiggle when cracked/broken.
bikewrench,3aoi09,fishboy728,3,Mon Jun 22 05:10:46 2015 UTC,"I did mine a few years ago, and as I remember, I had to move my brakes and shifters inward a little. I pulled the Isogrips off and cut the inner white padding down (there were notches) so that the end adapters would fit inside. I winged it since there were no instructions, and it worked."
bikewrench,3aoi09,the_hell_indeed,2,Mon Jun 22 05:17:50 2015 UTC,Bontrager makes specific parts to deal with these grips. I recently had to special order a mirror to fit someone's bike who had them and nothing else would fit. Try checking Bontragers website to see any isogrip specific bar ends
bikewrench,3aoi09,imcc1228,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:48:15 2015 UTC,"on my 2014 7.3 FX, my LBS told me I'd have to replace the handlebars if I wanted to change the grips. Apparently those IsoZones are molded into the handlebars. Could be wrong though, I dunno. Haven't tried messing with them yet."
bikewrench,3aoi09,Kahnza,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:06:03 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have to replace the handlebar, just keep the isozone pads on, and slide the new grips on like usual. The isozone pad simply lays in the groove of the handlebar, held by adhesive.  I'll wet the new grip with a diluted simple green solution, or use an air chuck with compressor (which is more fun anyway). Wetting with denatured alcohol also works well, if you have some. If you wet the grip for install, you can dry it out quicker with the air blasting method."
bikewrench,3aoi09,Philip_Pugeau,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:11:26 2015 UTC,"The grips are a lock-on, so you'll need a 2.5mm and/or 3mm allen wrench. There's two of those small bolts on each grip, one on the metal collar on the inside (towards brake lever, pointing to the rear of the bike), and one underneath the flattened portion on the outside (at end of grip, pointing down).  You don't need to take the grips off, only slide them in about 2~3cm. To do this, you'll also need to slide the brake levers and shiters in, which use a 5mm allen wrench. Leave everything loose when installing the bar ends.  The adapter is meant to make the end of the handlebar a rounded circle for the bar end, instead of having the cut out for the isozone pad. Simply slide everything in more than you need, plop the adapter in, slide the bar end on, align to the angle you want, and tighten the barend.  When re-tightening the grips, be careful not to use too much force, or you'll strip the aluminum collars out. I believe it says 2nm of torque, which is a feeble amount. You'll want about a 45 degree downward angle to the brake levers, fyi."
bikewrench,3anwxg,LoddaFussballgott,7,Mon Jun 22 01:40:46 2015 UTC,"Three possibilities   The fork is bent slightly to one side, or possibly the dropouts are not aligned anymore. Something is preventing the wheel from seating correctly in the dropouts. Check the axle and the dropouts for debris or paint chips.  The wheel itself is not dished correctly anymore. Basically the 'dish' of a wheel is the effect that spoke tension has on the relationship between the hub and the rim. A wheel is correctly dished when the spokes are holding the rim exactly in the middle of the axle locknuts.    It doesn't look to me like the guy in the video is giving the wheel 'bias' to one side, it is more likely that he is ensuring that the action of closing the quick release lever doesn't move the wheel in the dropouts. This can happen if the fork itself is slightly wider than the locknuts and has to flex inward under compression of the quick release.  It is not a good idea to use your quick release to lock the wheel in such a way that wheel will 'look' straight. The wheel needs to be properly seated in the dropouts, so that the bike is standing on the axle. The guy in the video seems to be talking about quick release tension, which is an important topic. Most hub manufacturers design the bearings to have a certain amount of pressure applied to them for smoothest operation. They achieve this optimal pressure by designing the quick release to match the hub. When a quick release is closed correctly, the pressure applied to the bearings is ideal, while also holding the wheel to the frame. Check the techdoc for your hub/QR skewer for more info.  If it is only off by a few mm and the wheel rolls, and brakes work, you can definitely ride to the nearest shop. Get the mechanic's opinion, maybe ask him to check the dish.   I hope that helps!"
bikewrench,3anwxg,einsama,2,Mon Jun 22 02:59:09 2015 UTC,Also check to see that the qr springs are facing the right way.
bikewrench,3anwxg,Bike-o-king,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:37:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply I woke up and HATED life because of the possibility of a bent fork...but I THINK it is number 3 (recently had a spoke replaced).    I went downstairs and checked the dropouts like you said, ran a finger through them etc, now the wheel rests slightly more centered I think(It's probably 1mm off now) It's really really hard to judge this because it's such a slight offset and all... I don't know if that's still something to even care about (I could've been riding like this for a month because I never bothered to check or I might have never noticed)    I'll have to go to the LBS this week anyway so I'll see what they say...a few minutes ago I checked the front wheel for the 100. time and it looked pretty center...maybe I'm just having on/off OCD on this one :D     This can happen if the fork itself is slightly wider than the locknuts and has to flex inward under compression of the quick release.      This is the case with my fork/wheel    Thanks for the reply!"
bikewrench,3anwxg,icallthebigonebitey2,2,Mon Jun 22 13:17:02 2015 UTC,"When you close the quick release lever your wheel will self-center in the dropouts.  However, when your wheel is off center while the quick release is closed, your wheel is probably out of true and needs a dish correction.  2mm is not a huge problem but your wheel is in need of a true, dish correction, and tension balance.  You can definitely ride to your shop and feel safe doing so."

bikewrench,3anwxg,AndyFatBoyMorris,0,Mon Jun 22 15:19:56 2015 UTC,You can see if its the dish of the wheel by turning the wheel the other way and seeing if its off the other way.
bikewrench,3anwxg,AndyFatBoyMorris,2,Tue Jun 23 22:45:17 2015 UTC,"You mean putting the wheel on ""backwards"", like with opposite tire rotation/QR on the other side? Did that, seems to be off the other way now -> so my wheel dish is off? Is that what you can fix with turning the spokes etc?"

While technically out of spec, you probably won't have any shifting problems with a 10-speed Hollowtech crank and a 9-speed drivetrain. You can even buy a 9-speed Hollowtech crank (Sora or old Tiagra), if you're worried about compatibility issues. I might have some more reservations about switching to 11-speed Hollowtech, however.

bikewrench,3amo70,swimcool08,17,Sun Jun 21 18:56:14 2015 UTC,"You may not be seating the pump head on the valve completely to depress the pin in the center or the pump head may be broken.  Unless you have Presta valve, which I doubt, in which case you need to open the valve before inflating.  A Shrader valve has a spring inside the valve that holds the valve closed and there is a pin inside the pump head that depresses the pin in the valve to open it.  If the valve is not opened when you start pumping, you will increase the pressure inside the hose which is why your gauge shows 60 PSI.  The pump barrel or base has a one way valve that prevents air to return into the barrel so the pressure is contained inside the hose and the gauge."

bikewrench,3am4iy,pigcupid,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:29:33 2015 UTC,"Ensure you are able to obtain the appropriate chainrings first because the 5800 uses 4x110mm BCD where the bolts are not evenly spaced.

Also, the larger mismatch could make for worse shifting as opposed to, say, a 50/36 setup. Unfortunately Shimano has stopped making wide range 12T cassettes so I can't say ""just go get a 12-28 cassette"" since you'll have to get a Dura-Ace one and not only are they expensive but the larger cogs are titanium and wear out faster.   I'd get a 50/34 crank and either an 11-25 or 11-28 cassette depending on the terrain and your riding style. A 50x11 gear is pretty tall, if you are turning that over for any appreciable period of time you should be racing at a high level.

That said, it's almost impossible to jam a cable fully in the new 6800 shifter. When you roll back the hood from the front (rolling towards the bar), you should be able to open up the other side of the shifter (inner side), which will give you access to some of the internals.

bikewrench,3am29z,thekernel,2,Sun Jun 21 19:34:48 2015 UTC,"These shifters are a classic case of form over function, the sharp bends to hide the cables causes them to fatigue and break with little use.  Best way to get the end piece out is to gently shift up and down the gears using something soft like a tooth pick to turn the ratchet and tweezers to manipulate the cable strands.  It's a pain in the ass, it took me about twenty minutes to fish one out."

If you leave a steel bike out in the rain for like, ten years, without a seatpost in it to stop water getting on the bottom bracket, you might get some rust. Otherwise if all of the frame holes are plugged (and that includes the seat post) it will be grand.

bikewrench,3al05a,anonanon1313,3,Sun Jun 21 15:01:11 2015 UTC,Salt is the frame killer. Winter riding on salt treated roads or storing a bike near the ocean (particularly near a surf zone) can corrode a frame. Chainstays are the most vulnerable spot.

Its got to take a lot, and usually I end up with a, ""Well that sucked"" as compared to moaning about it. Im currently frustrated with my line of work, but thats a side topic.   Pro Tip: Your tubeless is leaking out from the rim strip. If your tubeless set up is leaking from the valve, and its not UST, its getting past the rim strip. It wont leak around the spokes because they're sealed from tension, so the air goes to the loosest place: the valve hole. Try checking you tape again. I bet its shifted, too narrow, or something isnt being covered. Look up how Stans No Tubes does a tape job. It should be taught, and overlap itself. Also, dont be afraid to add more sealant that is recommended on the first go. Itll end up sealing all the new little cracks and stuff."
bikewrench,3ajimh,mudbutt22,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:20:41 2015 UTC,In addition after installing tape to a very clean rim install a tube and tire and inflate to insure all the tape is completely mated to the rim.  Then take the tube out and add the valve and sealant.  This usually stops tape shifting and blow by.

Also, you likely only have some surface rust that doesn't even threaten to eat through the cable tube. That said, removing the existing rust and preventing future rust isn't a bad thing to do, and could be easily done in an afternoon of work.  For removing rust, I'd suggest putting a rust remover onto a narrow strip of rag, and threading it down the tube. Most removers require several hours of contact to fully work, so replenish the rust remover on the rag, and be sure to move the rag to ensure all parts of the tube get good coverage. Once finished, make sure you thoroughly rinse out whatever rust remover you used; many of them are pretty nasty.  As for preventing rust in the future, there are some bicycle-specific products that can be sprayed on raw metal. Another option is heating the tube with a hair dryer, melting some paraffin wax, and coating the inside of the tube that way. Lastly, the easiest route would be to spray some WD-40 in there every time you change cable housing."

For the fork, do the same thing, remove the rust chemically or with a wire brush, and use paint to cover spots where there was rust. You should be able to find chrome nail polish that will look fairly good against real chrome, use a few coats if you need to build up additional thickness."

bikewrench,3agb17,mattfiddy,3,Sat Jun 20 17:09:00 2015 UTC,Use a pipe cutter.  No need to measure.  Just eyeball it and cut one side.  Then take the piece you cut off and use it to make a mark on the other side.  File down the sharp edges so they don't cut through your grips.  This is very common and many bars are too long on purpose so you can cut them.
bikewrench,3agb17,sebwiers,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:08:34 2015 UTC,"No problemo.  Carbon bars you need a very fine tooth saw or a rise cutter.  Otherwise, hack saw and tape / hose clamp guide, or tubing cutter.  Might want to move stuff in and ride like that a bit first to be sure you'll like it."

bikewrench,3agsyi,SavingHawaii,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:15:10 2015 UTC,"With the rear brake that barrel adjuster you're using is for fine adjustments.  What you need is a gross adjustment.  Here's what I do.  Use a clamp to loosely squeeze the brake calipers to the rim.  Something like this.  Your local hardware or automotive parts store should have something that works.  Loosen the bolt that holds the cable to the brake.  Pull the cable snug.  Tighten the bolt.  Now remove the clamp and use the barrel adjuster to fine tune.  If you don't want to buy a third-hand tool like that clamp, just ask a friend/sibling/grandparent/grocery clerk to squeeze the brakes while you work.  You will probably need to replace the brake cable and housing to get good action out of the brakes as these are likely corroded and interfering with the cable pull due to friction.  I would measure chain stretch before replacing the chain.  It's not that replacing the chain isn't a good idea.  It's that you want to know if you should just replace the freewheel as well.  A worn freewheel will quickly wear out a new chain.  Take a ruler and with the chain under tension measure 12 links.  This should be right about 12 inches.  A brand new chain would be exactly 12"", yours will be longer by a hair.  If it's past 12 1/8"" pin to pin, go ahead and replace that freewheel as well.  You could also decide the freewheel is due for replacement due to visually apparent wear like shark finning of the teeth.  Adjusting the dérailleur is easy.  It's not indexed so you don't have to adjust the indexing.  Start with a slack cable.  Use your hand and push the dérailleur all the way until it shifts into the big cog while you spin the pedals.  Tweak the limit screw until it will just shift onto this biggest cog and not further.  Do the same with the smallest cog and the other limit screw.  Now tension the cable so that it will shift over the whole range.  Danger Will Robinson: If the dérailleur can shift past the big cog it can go into the rear wheel causing you to crash and breaking all sorts of things on your bike.  Google Sheldon Brown.  Please.  You will thank me later."

Thankfully my dad helped me on that, so I was able to tighten each part of the brake line, and used the barrel for actual fine tuning.   The gear cables are rusty and I really should look into replacing those in the near future.   As of the chain goes, I do not have access to a chain breaker. Should I go to a local bike shop to completely replace my chains or should I purchase some chain breakers. I was taking a look into freewheels but I do believe that my current ones have enough life in them. I just started biking so I do not know how serious I will be into biking. Probably will but I will leave that in mind as a upgrade in the future. Do you have any suggestions on what I should look up for the free wheels? I will be doing a regular 5 mile commute with occasional ~25 mile commutes.  Yeah I took extra caution on this step.

This would be the first thing I would do, whilst you are at it might as well replace the cable housing.   If you replace the chain there may be a chance that the freewheel and chainrings have worn so the new chain would perform poorly.  New free wheels are very cheap but chainrings can be a bit more expensive, have a look at the chainring teeth, if they look like shark fins then they are worn and it needs replacing (although to complicate matters some teeth are machined like that to help shifting)."

Other than what everyone else said my only advice would be maybe after steel wool-ing (or brass wool-ing like someone else mentioned) maybe use a little bit of chrome polish or something of the sort to treat some of the more chrome-ish parts and what not. (unless someone would suggest against it?) I have used a little bit of chrome polish on some parts on my bikes after a light bit of steel wool and it seemed to help protect everything better. I would assume just keep away from the chain, brakes, and other important parts.   One last thing, I would defiantly pick up a chain tool and some new gear and brake cables all around.

See what happens, and follow the ""cord"" (which we call 'cables') from the lever to the derailleur.  Imagine what springs might be involved, and what the motion you observe is intended to do to the chain.  Now do the same thing to the rear.  It's harder to move that very far, but watch closely.  If you can, suspend the bike by its top tube, or have someone hold it up, and crank the pedals while you move the levers.  See what they do.  A fundamental understanding of the connection between the lever and the deraiileur requires no expertise, only a tiny amount of curiosity.  Once you have that understanding, things people say will make much more sense to you.  Also, there are a lot of beginning introductions to bike mechanisms and how to adjust them on the web; find some, read through them, and if you have specific questions on what they say or how things map to your bike, seek out experts here and ask them specific things."

I hear they're based pretty blatantly on the Pasela line, and are made by Panaracer to boot. Except with that not-kevlar casing.

Second, are the derailleurs lined up with a gear? The jockey wheels on the rear derailleur should be lined up perfectly with a gear on your cassette/freewheel. If the alignment is off, an incomplete shift can feel like a slip."

bikewrench,3aeqxh,pthu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:32:52 2015 UTC,"I think I misunderstood your post. Is it changing gears on its own, or is the chain sliding over the teeth instead of propelling you forward?"

bikewrench,3aeqxh,Vojta7,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:09:49 2015 UTC,"The main thing is that it sounds like it's slipping under torque. This article will explain things a bit: http://sheldonbrown.com/chains.html  I've personally had my rear cassette teeth wear enough to slip, but not look sharktoothy; the same may be the case here. Luckily, 7-speed cassettes/freewheels are relatively inexpensive (less than $25) as are chains (about $15).

IMO it could be sticking - while coasting, the spinning wheel would tension it just enough to loosen the chain tension a bit. After starting to pedal again, the cranks would first have to tension the chain again which would make them move a bit with practically no resistance which could be perceived as slipping."

It sounds like the pawls in the free hub aren't immediately engaging. This means one of two things. The first, and best case, is your free hub is part of the cassette andthe whole assembly needs to be replaced.

Paint. All these things all up. It might cost you $200 to repair a $50 bike.   Take a TON of pics before disassembly and during, especially of the complex parts, like the headset, bottom bracket, etc.  How to you plan to de-rust the parts?

As sacrilegious as it might be, if you were interested in selling it you actually might get more in the long run if you break it up for parts as-is.  Now, I am a sucker for vintage restorations, so I don't suggest that.  As far as faithfully restoring it for your own use goes, really you can't go wrong by simply replacing parts with new ones that are identical replacements; there are plenty of vintage style components to choose from that should match the original style.  You should be able to get bearings and small components at your local bike shop.  Any rust in bearing races can be sanded down and smoothed out, but ultimately you may still have some pitting to deal with and that will always cause noise in the bearings no matter what you try.  So if there is rust on the races, you might want to save yourself some trouble and replace them.  It does look like there's a heck of a lot of rust on this thing.  Make sure to check all the weld joints and tubes to see if anything's dangerously pitted.  You don't want this frame failing on you, even if it is a low speed cruiser.  Really the question that needs to be answered is what are you intentions with this.  If you want it for yourself, the sky's the limit!  Do whatever makes you happy because it's your bike now.  There's a lot more that could be discussed, but I don't want to go too far into it until I know you're interested in hearing it :P  If you want to sell it, see my second paragraph.  There are a lot of people that like to do these restorations, but some more unique bikes may take some time for all the salvageable parts to sell, even on eBay.  But parting definitely is something to consider."
bikewrench,3acsno,TheSkoomaCat,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:03:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'm not sure of my intentions just yet, I want to restore it to the point it looks brand new, but not at the cost of not being able to sell and make a profit if i decided so. I bought it because of the cool retro aspect and will probably hold on to it for a few years but I want it to look nice. I understand why collectors want the rust on vintage bikes because it's ""original"" but for what? do they just look at it? I thought I could buy this bike, take it apart 100%, clean/sand/polish/restore everything I could possibly do and then paint it, either with spray paint, or taking it to get powder coated and re plated, then sell it for a little profit. If I part it out as-is like you said im still too OCD over the rust. I don't see the logic in collecting rusted tools to look at and not use it. What if I did go the sky's the limit way and touched it up so that it still looks like an original but like someone took it to Pimp My Ride, could I sell it easier targeting casual riders looking for a cool retro feel bike than a die hard collector who fetishes rust?"
bikewrench,3acsno,TheSkoomaCat,2,Fri Jun 19 02:20:22 2015 UTC,"Some like the vintage rust for decorative purposes, while others want an old rusty bike so they can restore it themselves.  It is fun once you get into it!  You could probably still get some money from it if you restored it, but do the math first for how much replacement parts and paint are going to cost if you're concerned about it.  It's all about finding the right buyer, really.    Take it from me, if you decide to go the spray paint route, make sure you absolutely take no shortcuts!  And do your research on which paint to use, because trust me, if you cheap out and take shortcuts as well, it'll reflect through orange pealing and easy chipping.  Spray painting can be done right if you take the time to do it right.  The last frame I painted has held up pretty damn well, but the two frames before it chipped like no other.  Powder coating will be a ton more durable, but it's going to cost more that way, obviously.  As far as bike-specific tools go, it doesn't look like this one needs some of the more specialty ones.  You will need some pretty wide wrenches for the crankset there, but luckily you won't need a crank extractor.  I can't really see how the cog on your rear wheel is attached, but that may take a little work to get off.  If you get to taking it all down and you have some questions about the right way to do something, don't be afraid to ask!  There are plenty of us bike mechanics on this subreddit.  One thing that's just occurred to me about that bike, it's old and those tires might be oddball sizes.  See if you can get pictures of any writing on the sidewall of the tire.  If you're lucky they're compatible with modern sizing.  If you're unlucky you have to be careful about which tire to get.  We had a fellow come in to the shop I used to work at looking for a tire, somebody helped him out and he bought one off the shelf since the numbers matched up.  Turned out he needed an older tire that was a different size even though the numbers were the same.  It didn't help that he didn't speak much English either!  Took a while, but we finally got him what he needed."

Restoration of this nature (Non-commissioned) should not be undertaken with the intent to make money. It is not likely that if you ever sell the bike that you will even recoup your costs.

I do however recommend matching the front derailleur's intended spec with the chain. Front derailleur meant for an 8-speed setup caused some dropped chains as the cage was simply too wide, and a 10-speed front derailleur caused excessive rubbing."

A folding frame is going to have its own set of weaknesses. Add in that motor and it's more dubious. At the least, an ancient steel folding bike with souped up wheels might be ok, but reinforce the center link somehow. I dunno, purpose built is tops for a reason."

At 15ah, my battery is almost twice what I need round-trip, since my commute is short.   I'm also very small and have found that few (non-cruiser) ebike come small enough.   Warranty was something I considered, but since I built my own, I'm able to replace as needed. It'll only be ~$110 to replace the motor if it goes. Any wrench work I can do myself, or ask my LBS friends to help. Even if the battery goes the way of the dodo, my LBS guy has a roommate getting his PhD in electrical engineering (best luck ever). It'd be a matter of pulling out the batteries, voltage testing, finding replacements as needed, adding a BMS, and repacking. Could easily keep that under $150.

I hand-picked the most durable fork I could, knowing the front-mount motor was going to be punishing, and reinforced it with double torque arms.

Take public transport until you are close to your location, but speed up the remaining walking part by having a small but somewhat decent bike at hand.  An e-bike I can understand too. E-bikes are a fantastic way to get people to do more distance or more trips by bike than what they would otherwise be prepared/able/... to do.  Putting those 2 together doesn't really make that much sense to me. But then again, to each their own.  As a sidenote: If you were to swap all parts from your mountainbike to a super cheap bike, you'd probably still be stuck with a cheap crankset, cheap bottom bracket, cheap hubs/wheels,... as they would probably be differently sized. Your previous fork probably wouldn't fit and you'd have to pay to respoke the motor to a different rim + the parts.  After all that it'd still be a very shitty bike, albeit pricy and electric.

bikewrench,3aax1g,MustGetALife,2,Thu Jun 18 17:45:04 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to ballpark things and try to figure out how they got to this price.  Also, I'm assuming worst case scenario (that you've trashed your BB spindle riding with loose cranks).  Remove old pedals and reinstall on new cranks:  $5  Replace cable/housing and adjust derailleur:  $20 parts & labor  Replace bottom bracket and left crank arm:  $50 parts and labor  That comes out to around $75.  That assumes you've got a square-taper crank, because you can get left crank arms dirt cheap for those.  Did you ask the shop to explain a breakdown of the prices?"
bikewrench,3aax1g,55555thatisfivefives,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:10:34 2015 UTC,it is a square crank. Looks like a giant philips.   No I didnt ask about the price breakdown.. I will do that today after work thank you.
bikewrench,3aax1g,Smaskifa,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:16:39 2015 UTC,you may be able to just unbolt the old crank and install a new one...  if it's wobbly is should just come off one you remove the bolt... if you have a socket wrench (6 point) this can be very easy. a new arm on amazon is about $15 bucks... get a replacement set of bolts too...  -- 10 minutes of work max.

bikewrench,3aad3p,55555thatisfivefives,2,Thu Jun 18 14:22:20 2015 UTC,It's a standard looking riser stem and the shifter is a standard looking road stem shifter.
bikewrench,3aad3p,55555thatisfivefives,4,Thu Jun 18 15:24:51 2015 UTC,"as long as it's a stem shifter and not downtube shifter, and the clamp on the shifter matches the OD of the stem, you should be golden.  the only problem i can think of is if your RD cable routing goes down the top tube rather than the downtube, because some stem shifters don't play well with that routing, but as far as cable pull goes it shouldn't be a problem."
bikewrench,3aad3p,DonOblivious,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:42:46 2015 UTC,That's good thinking on the cable routing. I will try it out when I get back home. The clamp size should be no problem since they are both the standard quill stem size. The shifters are definitely stem shifters. I should know since I took them off! :P Thanks for your help.

bikewrench,3a95pg,Justcallme_DRIFT,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:26:37 2015 UTC,"This. Avid rotors, G2, G2CS, G3 easily bend and flex. The new Centerlines are brilliant compared to them and pretty dam cheap online. Don't bleed the brake.... There is no need to if it's working fine and not spongy. You might have the 1/10 good set of Elixirs that require nothing to make them work half-decently out of the factory!"
bikewrench,3a95pg,CertifiedUser,2,Thu Jun 18 13:40:44 2015 UTC,"Also Elixirs are DOT5 fluid, which expands as it gets warm.  The fluid in the hose is likely expanding thus putting pressure on the brake pistons causing the pads to rub against the rotor.  Also, to center the caliper try this:  Loosen the caliper fixing bolts; squeeze the brake lever several times to build up pressure; hold brake lever down (or use a heavy-duty rubberband) to center the caliper on the rotor; tighten caliper fixing bolts starting with the one closest to the hose, alternate and tighten equally.  If this doesn't work you likely have an untrue rotor.  You can bend it back into true using an adjustable wrench, never your bare hands and definitely nothing with textured or serrated jaws.  If that doesn't work, buy Shimano Deore brakes as /u/bikesnbikesnbikes suggested!"
bikewrench,3a95pg,icallthebigonebitey2,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:28:45 2015 UTC,Are they rubbing the whole way around or just certain spots during the rotation of the wheel?
bikewrench,3a95pg,k3dx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:56:21 2015 UTC,Elixirs are notorious for this sort of behaviour. Bleeding the system and putting in fresh fluid will provide a short term solution this kind of problem but to be honest they are just not a very good brake. I've spent hours upon hours bleeding and re-bleeding elixirs to no real benifit. Whether this reflects on my mechanical skill level is up to you to judge. Do what I'd do and buy a set of Shimano Deore brakes. Way way better system IMO

I never got the freehub off, I didn't know how, I believe I am just missing a large enough allen key.  I don't think it got worse after 'servicing'... 'think'.  I haven't looked at freehubs this closely before, and I'm sort of learning that this is how specialized kept the price down on the bike.

If you're talking about the barrel adjuster, you shouldn't be taking it off to replace the cable, if anything you screw it in all the way. If you're talking about the little cap that goes on the end near the derailleur, then that's a cable end and any shop that doesn't give you one or two for free when you purchase a new cable should be burned to the ground :)"

It's used to make fine adjustments to the cable tension without needing tools or really having to get off the bike while riding.  Follow the rear shifter cable from the lever to the frame, and you will see that it comes to something similar when it makes contact there at the frame stop. There should be one on the other side of the bike for the front cable."
bikewrench,3a8ksy,jack_perignon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:37:10 2015 UTC,yeah apparently there are two for the rear derailleur but none for the front.
bikewrench,3a8ksy,Bathorhythm,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:38:45 2015 UTC,"In an attempt to take a stab at this, maybe the person that worked on this bike previously put both barrel adjusters on the rear? The barrel adjusters should not be on the levers, they should only be on the frame. If you have two on the rear, that just doesn't sound correct. I can take a picture of what mine looks like but two for one cable is simply unnecessary."

bikewrench,3a8a62,tooff-ache,3,Thu Jun 18 00:35:16 2015 UTC,"Use a product called ""Liquid Deglosser"" which is sold at most hardware and paint stores. It will clean all the dirt and grease off the frame and it will roughen the surface enough for the new spray paint to stick well without a primer coat. Should be a quick and easy solution for what you are trying to do. A really great finish requires more steps and products than you probably want to use on this project."
bikewrench,3a8a62,slowbike,2,Thu Jun 18 02:05:21 2015 UTC,"I usually clean bikes (with WD-40, don't know if this is optimal) and sand them down before repainting.

bikewrench,3a8a62,HuntBoston1508,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:25:18 2015 UTC,"After you have used the liquid deglosser, i would recommend to use automotive spray paint + after that automotive clear coat. They are not water based as acrylic paints, so they are much more durable. Downside is that you need to do the painting outside or use a respirator mask. You should let the paint dry well before applying the clear coat (put the frame in garage/storage to dry)."
bikewrench,3a7hb9,zelenoid,2,Wed Jun 17 20:50:45 2015 UTC,Pictures. Post them. Is it possible your wheel is slipping in the dropout? Is it bolted on or is it using a quick release? I usually tighten single-speed chains until you can feel it start to bind in the crank arms...then loosen it slightly so there is no binding but the chain is taut.   The SRAM PC1 is an 1/8-in chain designed for use on wide (in this case 1/8 of an inch) Track Cogs and Chainrings. Is this appropriate for use with your Nexus cog?
bikewrench,3a7hb9,Aun_vre,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:05:27 2015 UTC,"I'll look to get some pictures.  Bolted on, and when I put the chain back on, they weren't loose, so I don't think it's slipping. The cog is still the original one that came with the bike, so I don't think it's wide (dito chainring). I wasn't aware theres a difference here with single-speed chains, could this be a cause?"
bikewrench,3a7hb9,Aun_vre,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:13:33 2015 UTC,"It's unlikely that the size of the chain is the cause, usually running a chain that is too wide can result in excess noise and nothing else. But it could be one of the contributing factors.   Single speed bikes typically use either 1/8in or 3/32in Chains and the corresponding cogs and rings."
bikewrench,3a7hb9,Topforms,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:19:39 2015 UTC,"I believe Pc1 is the right chain for a igh.  Usually I change the cog with every chain, it costs around $2. And you get problem like what you have now if you don't. Otherwise it might be the chain not being tight enough. Pictures please :-)"
bikewrench,3a7hb9,icallthebigonebitey2,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:19:42 2015 UTC,"Are you using a quick-link on your chain or a snaplock?  Make sure either is fully engaged (which it should be if you've been riding with it on).  Chain tension is probably the cause and as you suspected, it's probably because the chain is too long.  How do you tension the chain?  Do you have a chain tensioner on the dropout?  If not, try tightening the left side bolt first, then push the wheel with your hand on the rim just behind the seat-tube toward the right side then tighten the right bolt.  Tight is good, just not so tight that it binds the cranks.  Try removing one link from the chain if you have too much slack in the tightest position."
bikewrench,3a8g05,pieomy,2,Thu Jun 18 01:28:14 2015 UTC,"It might work, but I wouldn't do it.  The shimano un-55 bottom bracket used to come with metal cups and only costs around $30 - $35."
bikewrench,3a8g05,Turbobaker4,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:43:17 2015 UTC,"They're really not compatible. Yes, they're threaded to the same diameter, because that's an industry standard (well, one of many standards). There's no way to really tell that the cup you found will actually support your bottom bracket on the non-drive-side under the load of your pedaling. There is a way to find out, but it sort of involves destroying the threads in your bike's bottom bracket shell.  Also, a bottom bracket really shouldn't take a grunt and a fart's worth of torque to remove. That's probably caused by corrosion in the threads. So even if you go ahead and use this mismatched cup, you need to ask how much life is left in this cartridge. Will you have to go through this whole process again a year from now? As /u/Turbobaker4 says, the UN55 is the bottom bracket you want, and they're not particularly expensive.  You can measure the spindle with a set of calipers yourself and order online, but you might as well take it into a shop and have them measure it for you. Then when installing, be sure to clean the threads on your bike and grease the bb threads as the instructions say (Shimano recommends greasing metal threads, but not the threads on plastic cups)."
bikewrench,3a8g05,pthu,2,Thu Jun 18 15:31:03 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do this with a metal loose ball cup. Reason being that instead of being a right angle at the bottom like the one that's supposed to be there, there's a rounded taper, and as you tighten it down it could start crushing the cartridge bearing in your BB. Now if you found a metal nondrive cup from another sealed BB (likely rolling around somewhere at your local co-op/more budget oriented LBS) that'd be another story.  If you don't have access to either of those for whatever reason and your options are ""try this wild crazy mix and match option"" or ""buy a new BB"" I'd try it and worst case scenario you buy a new BB anyway, so it's not like you're worse off."

bikewrench,3a7en8,f00pi,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:31:38 2015 UTC,"That should work.  You'll need to pull your current cranks.  Usually that takes a 14mm socket to get the crank arm bolt off and then a crank puller.  Then you can remove the bottom bracket with a bottom bracket tool.  Install the new bottom bracket with a external bottom bracket tool, then put your left crank arm on with a 5mm allen wrench.  I recommend a torque wrench for this job.  Remember to pull your pedals before you pull the cranks."
bikewrench,3a7en8,55555thatisfivefives,0,Wed Jun 17 21:28:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about the crank set matching, but a torque wrench is a must for pretty much any tightening on bikes. Too tight and you can damage bearings, warp handle bars/seat posts, and even strip threads. Too loose will create wobble potentially damaging parts and could cause joint/muscle pain, or your handle bars could shift unexpectedly potentially causing you to crash. Everything bolt on you bike has a manufacture designated torque that you should be able to look up easily or there's Park Tool's fairly comprehensive list.  Also be aware that there are two different sizes of fully adjustable click type torque wrench's. The big ones  are usually from 12-60 Nm and the small ones are from 3-15 Nm. There are also small preset torque wrench's that vary at their setting."
bikewrench,3a7en8,messtastic,0,Thu Jun 18 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"No.  That will not work.  You have a FSA sealed bearing bottom bracket that is most likely a JIS square taper interface.  It could also be splined.  The surest way to know is by removing your cranks, which you must do anyway.  To remove your cranks you need an 8mm hex (Allen) wrench, bit, driver or whatever to undo the crank arm fixing bolts.  Then you need a crank puller to pull the crank arms off the BB.    Next is the replacement crank.  This should do nicely.  Same tooth count as the original chainrings on your bike so you don't need to worry about chain wrap and capacity issues.  You can use any JIS crankset you want as long as the rings are 22-32-44 tooth.  Also, be mindful of the crank arm length.  Measure from the center of the pedal hole to the center of the fixing bolt hole.  Should be something like 170mm or 175mm.    DO NOT REMOVE YOUR BOTTOM BRACKET unless the bearings are shot or you intend to replace that too.  In which case you'll need to know a few things about your BB shell width and spindle length so you don't mess up your chainline.  Just replace your crank with an identical or same spec crank and you'll be fine.  Torque on crank arm fixing bolts is 40nm, which is about 30ft/lbs. Be careful you don't shear your bolt heads off."

Excuse my ignorance, trying to learn."
bikewrench,3a7en8,icallthebigonebitey2,2,Thu Jun 18 06:16:52 2015 UTC,"No worries.  Learning is a good thing.  The creaking could be because the BB is loose, or the crankarm bolts are loose, or the cranks are damaged from the nastiness you described.  It's really a mystery until you start taking things apart.  It's not a bad idea to pull the BB when you're doing your crank swap to give it a clean and fresh grease (cover the whole body in grease!  Just do not grease the square tapers!).  When you do, inspect it for damage and loose bearings.  Feel the bearings on the BB, if it feels crunchy, it's dead.  If they spin without resistance, you're good."

bikewrench,3a7en8,icallthebigonebitey2,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:31:35 2015 UTC,"If you think you can handle it, do it.  The Deore is Hollowtech so it has external bearing cups.  You're going to need 2 different BB tools to complete the job: one to remove the old BB; and one to install the new BB.  Tooth count is the same so no worries there.

bikewrench,3a4iw5,Kwaker76,9,Wed Jun 17 06:38:46 2015 UTC,Pretty much this in general.  There are a few places near me and my normal experience is they are unfriendly as best and downright rude at times. I refuse to buy even the smallest tool from them now let alone service or major parts.  I did find a bike co-op that is open a couple days a week and those guys are pretty nice and prices seem reasonable for parts. I even bought a used tandem bike there. =D But it is pretty far out of the way and usually quite busy.  I just met another parent at our daughter's kindergarden(pre-school) and her partner owns a bike shop in town I have never been to. I have been looking at getting something better suited to handle a kid seat so thinking Im going to go there as I would rather spend a little extra to buy from someone I like rather than save a few bucks from someone across the country I will never see.
bikewrench,3a4iw5,RedditAntiHero,2,Wed Jun 17 09:23:17 2015 UTC,"Same here. Went to 3 shops with a very open mind and since I didn't have the spandex uniform and Lance Armstrong bracelet on, I guess I was too fat and wasn't extreme enough to warrant any help. Oh well, spent $1500 on bikes direct and tuned it up myself, much nicer bike than any of the shops had anyways.   Plus it's a damn bike, they aren't that complex. People act like they are impossible to get in tune, but they absolutely aren't with youtube and internet help."

I have been to a 3 different LBS around my area (Ok, I guess they are not really LBS if they are slightly out of my area but still...) and it is a vastly different situation from place to place. My closest LBS is AWESOME! (not trying to brag) the people in there have always been more than stellar and just simply pleasant to be around. Other shops in my area... well not so much. They are the same people that have that attitude of ""if you are not on a $2,000 bike and in spandex you are not worth my time.""   Me personally, I am always in the mind set to save a bit of cash so that is a little bit of a hindrance to my LBS, but if the people in the LBS are good people and knowledgable then I think a little bit of a price bump is worth it sometimes. On top of that sometimes there is nothing like being able to see and touch something in person too!"

When I started out I didn't mind, of course my LBS was Harris Cyclery and my wrench was Sheldon himself. A few years later (according to Sheldon) Harris was doing 70% of their business on the web, and Sheldon was encouraging me to do my own wrenching and buy wherever I wanted. I recently advised my son to go LBS for his gf's new bike. I'm sure they paid a premium, but the support was worth it. I know guys who go to the LBS for bike cleanings. I don't judge. A bike is no different than any other piece of machinery."

bikewrench,3a4iw5,conipto,8,Wed Jun 17 13:41:03 2015 UTC,there's more than the commodity of bike parts at play here.  LBSs are also great sources of knowledge and advice.  that this forum as an example.  the internet is ride with 'experts' that will dole out advice on everything under the sun but will either not have a clue as to what they're talking about or don't know the person they're giving advice to and go way off the mark.  I appreciate my LBSs because I can go in there and ask any dumb question I want and I'll get an honest answer.  even if the advice is off I can bounce ideas off of several shops and learn.  there's also the relationship of their wrenching.  I get lots of free service for small things because they know me and know I'll be back to buy stuff from time to time.  they also show me stuff as they do it.  I'm lucky to have some great shops in the area.  when to shop online?  when I know what I want and damnit I'm tired of buying another replacement (like tires) or I want something very specific.
bikewrench,3a4iw5,MaximumMinimal,2,Wed Jun 17 16:24:55 2015 UTC,"I've been an LBS employee most of my adult life whether full time or part time on top of a day job and I gotta say I agree with you.  If a store isn't willing to make the effort to earn your dollar they don't deserve your dollar.  Of the four different shops I've worked at over the years one of them (in Manassas VA) was truly terrible.  All Star Bike Shop (Raleigh), Bothell Ski and Bike (Seattle), and East Coasters (Roanoke) are the types of places I'd spend my money whether I worked there or not.  That said, there is one huge pain in the ass for US bike shops and that is Shimano's lack of MAP guidelines for their global markets.  That's what makes it possible to mail order many OEM packaged parts from UK for prices below what we can wholesale them for from Shimano of America."

Online usually has a better selection at cheaper prices with a better return policy and reviews to read from.   If they want charity money then im better off buying on-line and donating the money I saved

I was told he is too busy and that he won't have time to do it before Monday (this was Saturday lunchtime).  Which I suppose is fair enough, but then the local shop can't complain about being ""priced out"" by the ""big chains"" (Evans, Cycle Surgery) and online.

bikewrench,3a4iw5,proxin76,4,Wed Jun 17 16:34:02 2015 UTC,I think one of the best arguments for buying local is that more money stays in the local economy. You enrich your community instead of sending money out of state. Maybe you can ask your local LBS to work with you on price a bit?

bikewrench,3a4iw5,ColbiasTicklebush,3,Wed Jun 17 13:51:58 2015 UTC,"If you're lucky enough to have a good place locally to shop then consider it money well spent. On the other hand, many LBSs are not worth working with and treat people like retards. Case in point (and with your LBS experience maybe you have insight):  In the last week I shredded a rear tire and needed new ones ASAP to get back on the road. 2 local shops carried GP4000s but only one had the 25mm in stock which is what I wanted. They quote me $70 per tire which is already outrageous considering I knew they are available at $99 in pairs on EBay but OK, at least I could get them today and be back in the game. I say ""ok, if I come down there now on this old tire (less than a mile) can you guys throw the new ones on the wheels for me?"", the representative basically laughed and says ""ya, we charge $10 per tire for installation"". I promptly hit the Buy it Now button on EBay and was back riding in 2 days. These guys must know that their price on the tire is a HUGE markup over online prices and without free installation I'm left wondering what exactly their contribution to the marketplace is. Anyway, that's a pointless FRAT I wanted to get off my chest but my point is you should feel privileged to have a local shop you respect and if they'll at least do their best on price and offer great service I think it's usually worth it."
bikewrench,3a4iw5,cjsummitskier,10,Wed Jun 17 15:42:01 2015 UTC,So why didn't you just mount the tires yourself? Time is money and even a tire swap is going to be charged for labor. They didn't treat you like a retard you just feel entitled to free labor.
bikewrench,3a4iw5,B1CYCl3R3P41RM4N,3,Wed Jun 17 05:29:17 2015 UTC,"I'm confused. You asked them if they would charge you to do work for you, they said they would, and you got offended and bought the tire online? So you're saying a tire is worth money to you, but someone putting on for you isn't?   How'd your new tires get on your bike 2 days later? I guess you mounted the eBay tires yourself then? If that's the case, why did you even ask if they would mount them for you? If you could just do it yourself why waste your's and their time? Because it's convenient to have somebody to put your tires on for you. And that convenience is what you're being charged for.   Shops can't actually compete with online retailers on price, everybody knows that. Why do you also expect them to work for free?  If you went out to eat and didn't tip your server at least 15%(assuming they did their job) you would be considered an asshole uniformly. I'm not saying the two scenarios are directly analogous, but it's something you should consider the next time you scoff at someone charging you money for time out of their life."

After all, it takes a pro mechanic how long to swap two tires? 15 minutes tops while I browse the store and probably buy tubes plus more shit I don't need. If it helps you can think of it like this- I'm not asking them to put them on for free, I'm asking them to give me a reason to pay a $40+ premium for the same product. They declined to offer such a reason and I declined to give them $140, I ended up being a happy customer of some eBay tire-seller instead."

Since I've now travelled a few hundred miles on said tires without a problem I guess a can pat myself on the back since my tire change job was at least on par with what $20 would have gotten me from the shop mechanic. The product is also warrantied through EBay/PayPal if obviously defective or fake and as we all know, if you go get a puncture on a new tire from road debris you are not getting a warranty claim from Continental anyway. In the end it doesn't matter, people of your mindset will continue to run penny-pincher bike shops and customers like me will continue to order online and enjoy learning how to wrench on their own bikes as you wonder why it's increasingly difficult to make ends meet.

When I need small things like a couple of cables, housings, etc. I go to there but whenever I need some expensive stuff I buy online. Why? It's because they often don't have what I need, or have it at a significantly higher price. They also don't seem to like me very much, they call me ""the guy that does everything himself"" after I bought a bike online and said I can't afford to let them service my bikes all the time and often even couldn't wait for it (it's quite normal for me to do small adjustments minutes before a ride). Also, they didn't prove themselves to be as good as I need:   When I didn't know how to service my bike, I let them do it, specifically asking them to true the wheels and change the brake pads. It ended up costing 300 CZK ($14) but they clearly only did a quick tuneup and neither of the things I asked for. Once I let them bleed my brakes. Ended up paying $4 for both wheels but with the brakes not bled properly and a bit of oil on the rotors. And the guy also told me that I probably damaged the seals by using LHM+ (my brakes are Shimano Deore M615). A bit later I went to buy a new BH90 olives, he sold me a pair of BH56s which I didn't realize in time and then had a bit of trouble installing them. On one of my last visits there, I heard a guy tell a customer that the frame on her Epic (IIRC) was too small just because her saddle was a bit higher than the handlebars. I use a similar setup as well and my frame is nowhere near being too small. And he also told her that if the rear end bounces off obstacles, she needs to fully open the rebound damper (for those who don't know, what would make the shock rebound faster and bounce even more).   And they basically don't sell any special tools (I came to buy cone wrenches, they only had one of the sizes I needed and for 1.5× the price I then bought it for online, I wanted 50 ml syringes to make a bleed kit for my brakes and ended up with ones that were intended to be used with DOT fluid so the seals swelled on contact with the oil and made the syringes unusable they way I wanted to use them, there was no way for me to find out in time).  edit: Another LBS is straight out of the question because he's an arrogant d!ck who hates Maxbike (the brand of my frame), refused to work on it (again- bleeding brakes - test rode it on the sidewalk and said ""I was afraid it would break under me""), and basically called me an idiot for not buying a Rockhopper with (mostly) worse components and costing 5000 CZK (about $200) more which I couldn't afford.

bikewrench,3a4iw5,Vojta7,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:37:53 2015 UTC,"I wrote it wrong: I occasionally visited them even before I got that bike but since I got that and one other bike that I needed to build and service, I often make small purchases there, because there's simply no point in paying more for the shipping than for the part itself, and I tend not to buy a lot of things at once. And I actually recently bought a $40 helmet there. And a few days ago I got yet another bike that needs to be rebuilt, which means even more small purchases (I buy cables, then realize I ran out of housings, then tubes, then I need a new headset etc.). So I actually spend a lot (for me) of money there, just not all at once.  Buying a bike from them would also mean only paying more for less because the main benefit of most bike shops, being able to test-ride the bike for a while, simply doesn't exist there - it's a small shop next to a busy street with nowhere to ride. And since I can service the bike myself, I don't need free tuneups either."
bikewrench,3a4iw5,smithtys,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:38:00 2015 UTC,"My LBS is fantastic, so for me here's what it boils down to:  Does my LBS stock the particular item I'm interested in? If yes, buy from them.   If no, would it be potentially cost prohibitive for them to special order said item? If no, buy from shop. If yes, (e.g., if I had them bring in a $300 pair of shoes and they didn't fit now they're stuck w/ them) I'll order online from a retailer w/ a NQA return policy."

For buying shit - all the LBS near usually don't have what I want, or want much higher prices for it.  In addition on a number of occasions when I've been in they've tried to tell me I don't want what I want and even that I shouldn't be buying it at all.    The last case was a mirror.  I was looking for one and some snide twat told me I should just learn to look over my shoulder.  Sorry mate, but I've literally been looking over my shoulder riding bicycles since before you were born; I strongly disagree with you, am not interested in justifying my opinions to you, and I'm trying to spend money in your shop."

Clothing, shoes, etc, I always buy online.  Bicycles, I always buy from my LBS.  Yeah, I know I could probably get them much cheaper online, but online stores don't take the extra time to make sure that I'm buying the right bicycle for my needs, make sure that the frame size is right for me, take the time to get a perfect fit on the bicycle, etc.  All that is worth it for me."

A gadget/gizmo that I'll bolt onto the bike and can pick the PRECISE item I want from dozens of choices, when my shop can only offer 3-4 choices: Web.   I installed a generator hub and some pretty intense lights for it a couple years ago. Had to order the lights from Europe.

bikewrench,3a4iw5,quietIntensity,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:32:36 2015 UTC,"Depends if they have the part I want in stock for a reasonable price compared to getting it online.  Also depends on my online vendor, Amazon Prime parts will be here in a day or two, Jenson will be a week at the earliest, and Chain Reaction will be maybe 10 days.  A lot of times, if you tell a shop how much something costs you online, with shipping and tax, they'll try to get pretty close to that price.  If not, my LBS will at least tell me that I'm getting something cheaper than their wholesale prices.  I still spend a fair amount of money at the shop, as QBP doesn't sell a lot of stuff online.  For example, my last bike, I brought them a pile of parts to put on the frame I bought from them, and paid them to do the custom build.  They still got $1200 out of the deal, and I saved about $500 on some of the parts by buying them online.  A decent shop will be realistic about things, they know there are some killer deals online, they just can't access them due to contracts."

I've been in there enough that most of the employees recognize me and the owner knows me by name. It helps that I bought a ridiculously awesome/expensive commuter from them.  That being said, I do most of the maintenance on my bikes, have all the tools I need except for wheel building and shocks, and have also completely built a couple fixies from just individual parts. If I know exactly what parts I need or can figure it out with a bit of research I order online. If it's something obscure, something I need immediately, something I don't need to buy in bulk (cable end caps), or something I want to make sure will fit I'll go to the LBS. I'll also go there if there's something I can't figure out, which is rare."
bikewrench,3a4iw5,fn1889m,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:51:10 2015 UTC,"I am split on this. I buy specific parts if they are much cheaper on-line, but pay my bike shop to install them if they are beyond my ability.  I usually know exactly what I want for a repair, part number and installation method.  I am trying to learn to do the work, but its just not worth it to buy all the tools or screw up an expensive part.  I never complain about the cost, and almost always drop off a case of Mex Cokes for the wrenches if it is a big job. And I recently had my shop build a wheel set, and buy accessories such as lights from them, even if they are cheaper online.  I spend money, but i always know specifically what I want when I do. Its the same way I buy a truck, contract carpentry work, buy a canopy, tires, new shocks, etc.   I think of it as ""my"" bike shop. I would not go to another. But i cannot figure out how they feel about it. I have seen them fawn over someone buying a $3,000 bike. That is not me. They never fawn over me. Good for them. But i am dependent on the LBS to do the things I cannot do myself. I want them to feel my patronage is important enough that they care about their work and take pride in it. If they do not, then I will go somewhere else.  I think Ayn Rand defined capitalism as trading the product of the best of my efforts for the product of the best of the other guy's efforts.  That is a little idealistic in today's economy. It overlooks monopolies and efficiencies of scale. But its the right goal."

bikewrench,3a4iw5,mountainslayer,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:39:34 2015 UTC,How do all the online retailers continue to sell stuff below MSRP then?
bikewrench,3a4iw5,shitfucksniffglue,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:40:39 2015 UTC,"It depends on their source. Most local shops buy from big distributors. These are the companies that will refuse to sell you stuff if you violate your contract. If you can buy from the manufacturer or from a distributor who doesn't give a shit, then you can sell the product for however much you want.   Ultimately it comes down to the company and their control of where the product goes. There are companies like Shimano who don't give a shit about where their product goes once it leaves the factory. Some high end Shimano stuff can be found cheaper online than it can be bought directly from Shimano. Then there are companies like Thomson where it is hard to find their stuff being sold under MSRP even online."

I'm just a bike mechanic, that works really hard for not a lot of money and some cheap bike parts because I love bikes, and I love helping people with their bikes. I do shit for free all the time, small simple stuff. When I fix a flat tire for example, I don't just mount the tire and put the wheel on. if your bike needs some quick adjustments I will do them. Every bike that goes into and out of my stand gets the chainring bolts crank bolts and stem bolts checked. If your shifting could use a little touching up, I'll usually do that too. I'll also lube your chain and make sure your brakes don't rub. And if your wheel is a little out and I can fix it on the bike, I may even do that as well, just because I don't want your brakes to be rubbing when I hand you your bike back. If you get a flat fixed by me its worth your $10, maybe that's not true everywhere, but I make it true where I work. Maybe you have shitty shops around you, maybe your just not observant enough to notice the extra stuff they do. But I can promise you this, nobody got into working in a bike shop for the money, and if they did they aren't very bright."

bikewrench,3a6ema,ghost_sanctum,7,Wed Jun 17 16:18:15 2015 UTC,"So why did you reattach it? Did it fall off? It's likely a square taper crank. With square taper cranks, if you ride them when they're loose, you have a tendency to widen the interface between the crank and the spindle on the bottom bracket. This is because the crank arms are aluminum while the spindle is usually steel, and aluminum is softer than steel. Riding them loose tends to wear a wider hole in the crank arm, meaning the connection is never as tight as it used to be and the chance of it coming loose is higher. The only solution to that is replace the crank arm and don't ride it when it's loose."

bikewrench,3a6ema,motorbacon,2,Wed Jun 17 18:03:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, and even if it was still in usable condition, tightening a square taper crank set as hard as you can will only make it worse.

You just need the tools, and know in what direction to turn.   For the cranks: Just be cautious when you use the crankpuller: A stripped crank happens easily and can be a costly mistake. doublecheck when you thread it in, and doublecheck if it's all the way in. Again: If it's stuck you need some extra leverage.  headsets: Look at a clear picture/diagram/... or assemble in the same order as you removed it in. Get play out of the headset assembly by tensioning it with the bolt in the topcap, and do it again after riding a short bumpy ride.

The barrel adjusters are there, it's my bike and I can use them for what I like. My front derailleur doesn't have an adjuster, not inline, not at the cablestop, I tension it by hand. Or I don't, I don't know because bicycle repair is hard and only a pro-mechanic with something to prove on a 10 days old discussion can set tension on a cable without an adjuster. Because it is, after all, very hard."
bikewrench,3a6cuf,54slash12,2,Wed Jun 17 16:05:29 2015 UTC,You're going to struggle finding a crankset/chainring/front derailleur combination that shifts properly in that pairing of chainrings. That's a HUGE jump.
bikewrench,3a6cuf,D0rk4L,2,Wed Jun 17 16:09:26 2015 UTC,Only one sure-fire way to find out. Try it and post results.
bikewrench,3a6cuf,phatsackocrap,2,Wed Jun 17 16:56:33 2015 UTC,The maximum gearing jump you can acheive with most crank sets is about 16. You could run a 44/28 and run an 11-23 to achieve the gearing range your mostly looking for. You won't be losing a ton of top end by going to a 44 tooth
bikewrench,3a6cuf,B1CYCl3R3P41RM4N,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:59:09 2015 UTC,you could get a 48/24 from these guys but front derailleurs usually don't want to deal with more than about a 16-tooth difference.

Stan's won't seal it and if you put a tube in, you'll blow out eventually or immediately. You can try booting and using a tube but that's a temporary fix.  Two new tubeless ready tires will be worth the investment for the peace of mind you'll get knowing that everything is designed to work together."

bikewrench,3a1m1s,miyata_fan,3,Wed Jun 17 11:38:54 2015 UTC,Bought his book when I saw his death notices online. And built my first wheel just a few weeks ago. He really did make it easy to understand. But everyone who knew him agreed that he was a magnificent bastard.

bikewrench,3a46z6,Eggseronius,2,Wed Jun 17 02:29:33 2015 UTC,But how did it happen? Aluminum rarely bendz like that from an impact. Could it have come from the factory this way?
bikewrench,3a46z6,Hagenaar,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:56:02 2015 UTC,No idea how it happened. I haven't crashed it or done anything to it. It's not very noticeable so I guess it's possible it's always been like this and I just haven't noticed. Do you think it's still rideable?
bikewrench,3a46z6,B1CYCl3R3P41RM4N,0,Wed Jun 17 12:38:13 2015 UTC,Looks like a tube that got crushed in shipping to me
bikewrench,3a46z6,einsama,2,Wed Jun 17 18:35:43 2015 UTC,"Very odd. No obvious cracking at the welds? No obvious damage to the paint? How does the bike ""ride"", does it track straight?   Unless the bike was crashed or somehow compressed, I would say it is a factory defect that you are only noticing now. If the bike works fine, it may not really be worth trying to warranty.   Good excuse to buy a new frame though!"
bikewrench,3a46z6,einsama,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:29:06 2015 UTC,"There is a small chip in the paint you can see in the middle, but I haven't been in any crashes or done anything that I would have thought could have done this. I haven't been riding much lately, but haven't noticed any issues with how it rides.   Would you say I need a new frame, thought? I just bought the wife a new bike so I'm not looking to spend more if I don't have to."
bikewrench,3a46z6,Stickytapemeasure,2,Wed Jun 17 12:36:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need to rush out for a replacement. Metal frames can be bent and misaligned - slightly - without causing problems.   Might be worth your time to check the frame alignment, but this is more out of interest than anything else. Once aluminium is bent, it can not be safely bent back without weakening the material even more. If you want to give it a try instead of paying a mechanic to check, you'll need some string and a ruler. http://www.sheldonbrown.com/images/string-test.jpg   If the frame is off a bit but the bike still rides fine, it isn't a major concern. Periodically check that it doesn't change/get worse, and keep an eye on the welds.   I think your alright to keep riding the bike."
bikewrench,3a46z6,Stickytapemeasure,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:16:14 2015 UTC,"Well, I just drew a line alongside the plank you used (in ms paint) and it's not really that straight. In fact I drew the line because I could see with the naked eye that it's a little concave.   If you took the same picture with a straight edge, the bend would be 30 or even 40% less severe.   I'd say: Look for a nice straight piece of equipment, like a decent level, and compare the 2 sides again. Hopefully the bend will be less severe, or even equal to the other side.  If there are no cranks, no dents or no other types of damage apart from the slight bend, I think I'd keep riding it."

bikewrench,3a3zey,Bear_naked_grylls,4,Wed Jun 17 01:24:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't know where your family member learned that, but definitely leave on the fresh chain lube. At least that's what I've learned from multiple people that have taught me bike maintenance."
bikewrench,3a3zey,JamesK3,5,Wed Jun 17 01:59:09 2015 UTC,"Factory lube is the best lube, however, if you want to remove it and add your own lube go right ahead. You're robbing your chain of a whopping 200 miles of riding with factory lube. Whatever."
bikewrench,3a3zey,55555thatisfivefives,3,Wed Jun 17 02:14:18 2015 UTC,I never use a degreaser. The best way to clean a chain is in a lubricating substance. Wax bath or more chain lube.
bikewrench,3a3zey,Hagenaar,2,Wed Jun 17 14:58:05 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  I'd imagine the factory prep does other stuff aside from being a lube, like oxidation and rust protection, being thick enough to be handleable and stuffed with preservatives to stop it going off on the shelf.  I'd clean it off and lube it with the stuff chains is supposed to lubed with (and good stuff at that). At least then you start as you mean to go on and you have a known metric for when to maintain/relube the chain.  /10c"
bikewrench,3a3zey,MustGetALife,2,Wed Jun 17 10:08:57 2015 UTC,"Depends. They may have changed the factory lube formula from a few years ago. I always used Shimano chains and always let the factory slime on for the first week or until it started to squeak. But this past winter (when it was cold) I put new 11spd Sram on and let the factory coat on the chain, and it chattered under higher power all the time. Everything was brand new and perfectly aligned and adjusted...it was the chain coating. I degreased it and relubed it and it did not bind up and was then quiet.  I believe they tell you to take the factory coating off, then lube. I think the cold wasn't jiving with the factory slime - perhaps SRAM and Shimano use a different coating. I recently put a new Sram chain on in the summer and left the coating on and it was fine. So, in conclusion, if it's cold take it off, if it's warm leave it on -  or if it it gummy and binding lube over it."
bikewrench,3a3zey,ThanMan,2,Wed Jun 17 16:36:41 2015 UTC,"I use the factory lube on a new chain for about 400 miles before dropping the chain in acetone and then a crock pot full of melted paraffin wax. The stock lube is a little noisier, but is otherwise a suitable substitute to waxing the chain. But most liquid based lubes are not better than Gleitmo, so dont strip the chain right away and apply your own stuff."
bikewrench,3a3zey,Gushr,2,Wed Jun 17 02:18:41 2015 UTC,"Why the wax?  Surely the best way to lube a chain is sparsely. Its a balance between reducing friction whilst not attracting grit? Bike chains are not in the same environment as in an engine, its the crud which kills them, not the miles"
bikewrench,3a3zey,MustGetALife,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:11:17 2015 UTC,Dry paraffin wax repels the crud by providing a surface the crud can't stick to. I can reach down and grab my chain at any time (heheheh) and the only thing on my hands will be a few waxy flakes.

Basic rule of thumb, unless your chain needs replacing prematurely you should always replace the cassette and chain at the same time. At a few thousand k, your cassette owes you nothing.  If your chainrings look like shark fins/hooks, those need replacing too. Chainrings usually tend to last longer though, typically lasting through two chain/cassette lifetimes."
bikewrench,3a3zey,B1CYCl3R3P41RM4N,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:32:55 2015 UTC,"The only reason to do what you're describing would be in a sandy environment where a lighter weight lube will help keep sand particles from collecting. For any other terrain, just leave the factory lube in there. You will never lube your chain as well as shimano did. If the sticky residue on the outside of the chain is really bothersome to you, just take an alchohol soaked rag and wipe it off."
bikewrench,3a46jx,clemsonj,6,Wed Jun 17 02:23:00 2015 UTC,"Thats an odd place for steel to start cracking. From looking very closely, its seems to be the paint cracking. You can see the rust developing on the seat stay. I would say that the paint job is breaking away.  You should get it looked at just to be sure. You can get it fixed. How easily will depend on if its just the paint, or if it is badly rusted, or actually cracking.   No, your bike isn't going to fall apart. Steel is a very resilient material, even if it was to break while you are riding, it wouldn't be catastrophic, the frame would just warp and the bike would go wonky. You'd probably still be able to ride it, even if it was broken.  Best of luck!"
bikewrench,3a46jx,einsama,2,Wed Jun 17 04:19:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it won't break and send you flying. When mine cracked ruining the frame I didn't notice until I felt my hwheel rubbing against my seat tube I had also repaired it with a welder after it cracked straight through and you could slide the metal of the seat stay from the seat tube. It could just be a paint crack."
bikewrench,3a46jx,noburdennyc,3,Wed Jun 17 04:28:14 2015 UTC,"get something like 100 grit sand paper and sand away the paint, then 400 grit so you can see where the crack ends .  Backlight it and see if the crack is through.    If its cracked through, sand a large area and bring it to a welder.  Even a basic auto garage could tack that crack and you should be good to go.  Just remove the paint in the area so it doesn't bubble and smoke while welding.  After that... paint it up.    After that, I would go ahead and stress test the rest of the frame before riding it."

Car welders are normally crap. Have a look for a piping fabrication company. Pipe welders are fully coded and could weld it as good as possible!"
bikewrench,3a46jx,noburdennyc,2,Wed Jun 17 19:57:47 2015 UTC,"The crack in the seat stay? I had a frame fail here, I traced the cause from stretching the rear axle width to fit more gears and then riding hard over rough city roads.   Mine cracked straight through on one side then I welded it. It lasted for around 6 months before both sides cracked loose of the seat tube. You could ride it until it fails further but I'd say the frame is toast it could stay cracked and like it is to ride for a long time or break with a hard bump in a week.   My frame broke going into work. I had to walk it from the east river to 110th st. ugh."

bikewrench,3a3y1m,55555thatisfivefives,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:58:25 2015 UTC,"I love the bike! I bought it from a gentleman in his 80's who had ridden the bike up and down and across the united states. It originally came from cannondale with front and rear racks and matching bags. The frame, racks, and most components are still in great shape. I had to replace a chainring, and I'll replace the bottom bracket soon (there is a bit of clicking). From my research I think I have a '87 ST800 based on the components. However, the frame I have looks like a '90 ST1000. Either way, the frame is rock solid. I believe it's regarded as one of the best touring bikes from the time period.   I fully intend to continue building it up as a touring bike for long distances. The rear racks were enough for a cleveland to cincinnati tour. For that trip I even used the original cannondale panniers in the back. I've since gotten waterproof ortliebs. I've been working on adding fenders and re-attaching the front rack. After that I certainly need some new wires (I think the wires are original!), maybe bar end shifters, and whatever else comes to mind.   Compared to my other bikes - a steel 80's panasonic or a lugged carbon 90's trek, the cannondale is so much stiffer. Stiffer in a good way. I feel power is immediately applied, and hills can be tackled with much better efficiency. Ride comfort with big 32mm tires is great. The cannondale I'm sure is much stronger, and just as light and quick as the other bikes as well.   I'm sure you'll like it if you can find one!"

Valve core removal is trivially easy...and he already has a stans injector. I don't understand why this would be necessary?  This might be useful if you get a trail side flat or you manage to burp a bunch of sealant out of the tire?

Also check the mount position of the derailleur; this Park Tool guide will be helpful:  http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/front-derailleur-adjustments  If your front derailleur still doesn't reach, you may want to double-check you got the correct bottom bracket; your new one might be too wide.

bikewrench,3a2vpa,Ausrufepunkt,3,Tue Jun 16 20:15:56 2015 UTC,"1)  A drop of light lube at the pivot will be fine.  2)  If you want better stopping power, get nicer brake pads.  If you don't care, get the cheap ones.  3)  Sure whatever.  4)  With the bike on the ground, wheels down, loosen the wheel, then while pressing down on the bars with 5-10 pounds of force tighten the wheel again.  That should center it in the dropouts.  5)  Are the cables bright and shiny?  Do they move without much friction?  If so, keep them.  If not, replace.  6)  You can break that spoke protector off, but why not just remove the cassette and do the job right?  It takes five minutes.  7)  I wouldn't use anything abrasive.  Mild soap and water.  Maybe a degreaser for tough spots.  Sponge or rag.  No hose.  NO POWER WASHER  8)  Live with the noise or get a different free wheel or free hub.  You don't want to go down the roadie road of packing it with grease and having pawls not engage or the BMX road of trying to get it as loud as you possibly can.  Just live with it.  9)  Stem bolts tight.  Pedals tight.  Cranks tight.  Quick releases/axle nuts tight.  Hubs properly adjusted.  Chain proper length.  Chain not worn.  Cassette not worn.  Chain rings not worn.  Bar tape ok.  Brake levers secure.  Seat post not past minimum insertion.  Stem not past minimum insertion.  Brake levers can't touch bars.  Braking surfaces not worn.  Pads properly aligned to rims.  Tires at proper pressure.  Rear derailleur low limit screw not allowing RD to shift into wheel (super important since you're removing your spoke protector).  Spoke tension even.  Wheels true."

Did you mean to remove your freewheel?  That takes a a freewheel remover tool.  They're cheap, will last forever, and lets you remove your freewheel, which you're going to have to do sooner or later.  3)  Yes a chain tool isn't going to care how worn your chain is.  It'll push a pin out like it was brand new.  Your freewheel doesn't look too worn to me, but the proof will be how it performs with a new chain."

bikewrench,3a2vpa,yeahifuck,3,Tue Jun 16 21:11:00 2015 UTC,"There are a few different freewheel standards.  They are not universal.  Your other bike uses a cassette, which uses a standard tool.  To make sure you get the right one, take your wheel to your LBS and let them try a few different ones to make sure you get the right one.  Chain wear indicators should work on all chains, but often they don't indicate properly on single speed and 5-speed chains.  For that you can just use a ruler."

bikewrench,3a2nl0,anonlymouse,4,Tue Jun 16 19:20:10 2015 UTC,"That nut isn't really meant to be tightened, it's mainly to prevent the valve from turtling in when getting the air pump head attached. Note that Schraeder valves don't even come with a nut, and they work perfectly fine (except for the turtling thing).  Tightening it too far can cause the valve to separate from the tube - there might be a tiny little rip in the seam between metal and rubber, or somewhere around there.  There's no way to patch this type of tear; you'll need a new tube."

bikewrench,3a24ek,MTFUandPedal,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:33:58 2015 UTC,"An aside - but that's a damn high pressure for 40c tyres. Really high, considering 60psi is a road pressure for the 35c tyres I run on my cx.  The bugger the tyre, the lower the pressure you need. This could be a contributing factor along with the wrong sized tubes.  Normally you will get away with tubes slightly out on size. Evidently luck is not on your side.  If you took any advice from the lbs about either tyre pressures or tubes - unless there's another factor involved I suggest they are idiots and another shop should be frequented...."

You haven't mentioned the brand of the hub, so it's possibly a Formula/Joytech hub with Alex rims? Not unusual for that to happen already.  Or, it may just be a loose cassette and you only need to get the lockring tightened.

And I noticed that they only sound when I'm spinning it freely, and not when I'm cycling, although I suspect it's due to the sound being too soft to perceive while cycling.  On another note, I don't think it's the cassette. It's pretty tight there, and shifting is fine.   I bought it from Wiggle, and it's been almost a year ago. I was thinking of bringing it in to the bike shop for a tune up, but I've got a ride on Friday, and I hope to not miss it."

There are bearings inside the freehub, not the hub, and if it's a lower-end freehub, there may not be any servicing you can do to the freehub body. Once they develop play, the body is done. Hard to say without seeing it with the cassette and freehub body removed."

The UPC originates from the factory, so you could walk into a Performance Bicycles and see that a Fuji and an in-house brand like Scattante will have the first six digits of the barcode that match half the bikes from a Specialized dealer.   Specialized doesn't have a factory. Besides bicycles, they sell cranks and other components which they don't make themselves either. The only thing they actually make (don't even say they make their carbon, cuz they don't make all of them) are water bottles.  Giant is the only brand with their own overseas factories, and they make bikes for other companies like Trek.

I have no idea what the used bike market is like in Birmingham, but in Columbus Ohio I'd expect that bike in minty condition to get $200-250.  If it needs new rubber and cables and chain and pedals (those are road pedals intended for the kind of shoes with big cleats on the bottom) and a good look at the headset and bottom bracket and freewheel  and and the tools to install everything you could spend $200 right there...  BUT  If it needs new rubber and a new chain and a lot of elbow grease you could be looking at a bargain.    I'd be wary, though, and take a critical eye to the inspection.

I run Rival on my CX bike as well as just recently ran into some front shifting issues due to a stripped out barrel adjuster. SRAM front shifters need a lot of cable tension for the DoubleTap to work properly. Do you have a barrel adjuster installed along the way somewhere for the FD? I'd tighten/shorten it up as much as possible, hand tension the cable as much as possible and then tighten the pinch bolt. If it doesn't shift, add some tension into the system with the adjuster and try again."

You have to remove the BB to get access to the chainstays and that end of the down and seat tubes. You have to remove the seatpost to get access to the seatstays (maybe) and that end of the top and seat tubes. Plus you have to be able to rotate the frame every which way to get the tubes coated (framesaver goes in as a semi-aerosolized liquid - you can't hit all the surfaces directly). I suppose you could leave the derailleurs attached, but at that point, you're not saving yourself much effort.

Also: How does the loop in the back look? If it's too tight it won't shift right, if it's too big that not good either. Check if the outer cable isn't frayed. The cable should be cut cleanly.  Check if the derailleur is functioning well. Loosen the cable and check if the derailleur can move freely for the full range. Check if the derailleur returns correctly (just by the tension on the springs ect.). Clean/Lube if it's dragging.  Check that the cable is anchored correctly, and that the cable doesn't slip.  If you have new cables, press the cable ends firmly onto the cable.  The front:  Check that the derailleur is parallel with the chainblades.

bikewrench,39wsaw,flippertyflip,3,Mon Jun 15 19:25:02 2015 UTC,Lol. Thanks.   To the downvoters: Cables com pre lubed. If you've managed to wash away the lube your cables are already oxidising so you should replace them.  It's not expensive. Especially if it means they work.   Inners. Approx every 12 months. Outers 24 months ish.
bikewrench,39wsaw,Stickytapemeasure,2,Mon Jun 15 22:10:13 2015 UTC,"It's not expensive. Especially if it means they work.    Not one of the downvoters, but certainly not agreeing with you.  It is very much expensive. Online it's around € 40 for both brake and shifter cablesets (actualy it's more). If I were to buy it in the LBS I'm 100% sure it would be even more expensive. And that's basic Shimano sets. Not Jagwire Ripcord or something more fancy/colorfull/magically lubed/...  I have 2 bikes I use weekly. Then I have a mountainbike (mostly used for when it's snowy on my commute), a steel roadbike with Tiagra 4400 (I bought the shifters + derailleurs for €7 used but prestine), an old 10 speed race tandem,...  Changing the cables every 24 months would cost me more than € 8 monthly, or €100 each year. That's a lot. Especially when you consider that I bought all my bikes used. My first roadbike, full ultegra 6500 with mavic rims on ultegra hubs, cost me € 270.   My Cannondale Synapse cost me € 450, my steel bike cost me a total of € 7, two six-packs of beer and 2 tires,...  I'd rather buy myself a new wheelset each year than buying a bunch of cables to replace them well before they start to wear out.  So my routine is more like this: If it's not broken, don't fix it. I do check the cables by removing the outers from the cablestops and inspecting the cable-ends in the shifters and brakes.   Cables on my first road bike are changed just recently, after 6+ years of owning it. I changed the shifter cables when I bought it, but the brake outers where already on it. The cables are all still perfectly fine, but I wanted to get differently colored cables. (But of course that's not what I tell my wife. If you ask her, she'll tell you that the cables were worn to shreds.)"
bikewrench,39wsaw,flippertyflip,0,Tue Jun 16 06:51:13 2015 UTC,I don't get the argument that just because you paid very little for the bike then you shouldn't pay for consumables like cables. All bikes need parts like this die to wear and tear.  You can get cables much cheaper than those pre packaged sets.  Also the dates are a rule of thumb. Not something to be stuck to religiously.
bikewrench,39wsaw,Stickytapemeasure,2,Tue Jun 16 08:38:09 2015 UTC,"The argument is not that ""I paid very little so I don't have to pay for consumables like cables"".   The argument is that changing the cables every 24 months would make the cables cost more than my complete bike with Ultegra groupset and decent wheels after 8 years. Contradictory to the statement ""it's not expensive"".   The argument is that my 6+ years old cables were still functioning perfectly after many many miles. I would have cost me more than € 100 to change them multiple times (on this bike alone), and I wouldn't have even noticed any difference.  you should pay for consumables, but only when they need to be replaced. About everything is a consumable on a bike. Wheels, brakepads, chainwheels, chains, tires, cassettes, pulley wheels, cables, headsets, bottom brackets, cleats,... If you were to replace them all before their time is up, you are paying way to much on your maintenance..  Replacing cables is expensive. Especialy if you need to pay somebody to do it.  And that is only counting the expenses on a single bike."

bikewrench,39wsaw,Bathorhythm,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:22:28 2015 UTC,"1) Just be sure that if you have like-for-like, that your cable shield lengths are EXACTLY the same length as the old ones. Shield length is critical as much as a free cable path. 2) Ensure that your B adjustment on the rear derailleur is correct.  3) If you still can't do it, sometimes it best to take a break, open up the installation manual and go through each step carefully.  4) Not everything on youtube is Gospel. An example here is the simple trick of ensuring that both adjustment barrels on the cable (ie at the shifter and at the deraileur) are at MID position when tightening up the cable lock bolt/screw. This gives you good adjustmment either way should you need it. I've seen a good few youtube guides on derailleur setting and non of them mention this simple tip,"

If you really need/want to spend money, buy a pair of BR-5700.  BTW ST-5700 come with cable and housings. 50/34 11/28 should work fine with short cage but just to be safe avoid big/big combo."
bikewrench,39ydd6,uluchay,2,Mon Jun 15 21:20:09 2015 UTC,"Second this, don't over buy components unless you want too for the sake of it.   Short cage 11-28 should work. I ran the same ratios with SRAM Rival and it looked ok even in big-big. Of course, why ride 50:28 when you'll have 34:19 giving the same ratio."
bikewrench,39ydd6,_Ymodos_,2,Mon Jun 15 21:43:12 2015 UTC,"If you're racing, the big/big combo is necessary to attack on climbs. You just shift to the big and go on a sprint to drop your opponents. Oldest trick in the book. But of course a casual rider would shift down to the inner ring way before reaching the bottom of the cassette."
bikewrench,39ydd6,uluchay,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:23:31 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree, there is a point where you want to use big-big. And I tend to stay in the big ring for most of my riding where I currently live. But its rarely necessary to go below 50:21 here.  But, as you said, for casual riding it makes sense to drop to the granny ring. I just don't know the guy/gal asking the question."

bikewrench,39ydd6,55555thatisfivefives,3,Tue Jun 16 00:32:08 2015 UTC,"I would let your LBS handle the cables, since 1) they probably will give you a better price since they buy them in bulk (at least we do) and 2) you only pay for what you use (we charge by the foot, so you're not wasting  anything).  If you're going to ignore that advice and buy cables, then you need to buy 2 road brake cables and 2 shift cables, and then the appropriate housing to go along with it.  You can go with either short or medium cage.  I say go medium because it gives you more options in the future.  Upgrade the brakes?  That's up to you.  I think you'd notice a worthwhile increase in performance moving up to some 105 brakes."

bikewrench,39y0yh,pthu,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:25:45 2015 UTC,As in they're hard to find or hard to setup?   Would these do the job?  http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/SHIMANO-ULTEGRA-BAR-END-SHIFTERS-SL-BS64-/291491364770?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_3&hash=item43de3d3fa2
bikewrench,39y0yh,55555thatisfivefives,2,Mon Jun 15 20:29:58 2015 UTC,"As in hard to find. The shifters you linked to are 8 speed, which has different spacing than 7 speed. It will work well when set to friction mode, but I wouldn't recommend it for indexed shifting. It is possible to get the two to work together, but it's very finicky and requires frequent maintenance."
bikewrench,39y0yh,55555thatisfivefives,3,Mon Jun 15 20:38:16 2015 UTC,"No. The gears on a 7-speed and a 10-speed cassette are spaced differently, meaning that on each shift of a 10-speed brifter won't pull the correct amount of cable to shift your 7-speed cassette.  Also, there's the issue of hub widths, so you're unlikely to get away with putting a 10-speed cassette on your 7-speed wheel. Plus, the rear derailleur and chain may not be compatible, either.  You'll also need to figure out the clamp diameter new drop bars and make sure they match the clamp diameter of your current stem. Depending on your bike (hard to tell without pictures), it's possible you'll need to buy a new stem as well.  Perhaps it might be easier finding a 3x7 brifter set than trying to install a known broken set."

Once you've lubed it, wipe down the side plates of the chain hard and gently pass over the top and bottom with a dry cotton cloth. The rollers inside the chain are the only place lube really matters.   Also, try different lubes. I switched to Silca Nfs (available from Amazon) and it made a huge difference in buildup and lube longevity. With ProLink Gold, I had to clean and reapply every hundred miles or so.  With Silca NFS, the chain is clean and smooth for 200 miles of dirt road."

bikewrench,39sza2,SavingHawaii,3,Sun Jun 14 15:31:53 2015 UTC,"If you're riding in dry summertime conditions a wax-based lube can be nice.  They don't attract dirt like wet lubes so your chain stays much cleaner.  But dry lubes don't hold up very well if you're getting rained on.  You might include more quick rag cleanings in your service plan too.  Rather than stripping and oiling the chain 3x in 200 miles, just do a quick spin of the chain through a rag after every ride (or every few days or whatever) and move the chemical maintenance to 1x every 200 miles or about that."
bikewrench,39sza2,Trisomic,9,Sun Jun 14 15:43:33 2015 UTC,"I used to do that, as well, but I noticed my chain starting to squeak on the power stroke. I think it's hard for the lube to work it's way into all the nooks and crannies when you start from scratch every time. So now I just lube the chain every ride and cleaning the excess lube off gets most of the superficial debris. Then every 5-10 rides I degrease.   But if your method works for you, more power."

Some stuff is so light that it will wash off under the slightest precipitation. Like ProGold for instance. Great lube, but requires far more studious application. I use t9 as a personal favorite, and typically the rain will see weekly applications of chain lube. It does a great job of flushing out all the junk and reapplies the bond close to the metal.  Moral of the story: if it seems kinda dry it probably is. If youre squeaking its probably time to juice it up.  Thick black goop is probably a good sign of overkill."

Seriously though, there is no need to clean a chain after every ride, mtb or no mtb. I've ridden thousands of miles off road. Never once have I needed to degrease my chain. Probably because I don't bathe it in oil, I use Teflon lube judiciously and clean the plates with an alchohol sprayed rag after. The only scenarios I can think of where a chain actually needs to be degreased is on a bike that is ridden in the rain A lot(but if you wipe your chain off with a dry rag when you get home, this is unnecessary) ridden exclusively in the desert or beach, was sitting in a garage/shed for years, or on a bike using dirty/too much lubricant. Also muddy cyclocross bikes, that's totally reasonable."

bikewrench,39sza2,B1CYCl3R3P41RM4N,0,Sun Jun 14 23:42:24 2015 UTC,there is definitely a such thing as over lubing. If you're going to just wipe a half oz of lube off of the chain when you're done you're wasting lube and therefore over applying it.
bikewrench,39sza2,Bathorhythm,3,Mon Jun 15 00:18:18 2015 UTC,"my philosophy, as an 8 year professional bicycle mechanic, is to do nothing unless it starts to squeak. a squeaky chain is a dry, but clean chain. you can lube it then and feel confident that it is clean, free from debris.   chains are expendable, plain and simple. there's nothing you can do short of not riding to keep the chain in ""perfect"" condition. you will have to replace it depending on how often you ride, and in what conditions you expose the chain.   it doesn't really matter what you use, how you do it, when you do it, as long as you keep an eye on the chain wear. use a chain wear indicator to keep track of this. if you don't, then you run the risk of wearing out the rest of your drivetrain.  other than that, just don't tell any bike mechanics how you lube the chain, you're liable to give them an aneurism with your obsession.  reminds me of the guy that rode up to my work van and asked, ""can i get some chain lube?"" ""no."" ""C'MON MAN, I just need a little to get home!"" ""lol, no you don't."" chain lube doesn't make you faster, in fact, the more you put on the heavier your bike will be."

bikewrench,39sza2,beanslc,3,Tue Jun 16 05:33:14 2015 UTC,I dont degrease at all. Every few rides ill throw a bunch of lube on there and clean it with that. The degreaser will take lube out from inside the rollers and between the plates that wont easily be replaced by dropping chain lube onto the chain.
bikewrench,39sza2,55555thatisfivefives,5,Mon Jun 15 03:40:18 2015 UTC,Keep it up.
bikewrench,39sza2,kopsis,2,Sun Jun 14 14:15:16 2015 UTC,"Chances are you're not getting the solvent/water out of the internals. You generally need to bake (or otherwise heat) the chain to force it all to vaporize. If you don't get the solvent out, the lube won't penetrate and your chain will end up wearing more quickly. Lube as needed, but degreasing more than a couple times a year is excessive in most circumstances."
bikewrench,39sza2,B1CYCl3R3P41RM4N,4,Mon Jun 15 01:23:07 2015 UTC,"That's too much. It's probably not doing any real damage, but it's definitely a waste of degreaser and lube. Once a month is usually good enough if you're meticulous, but still unnecessary. I've never decreased a chain on any of my bikes and it's extremely rare that I do it on any of my customer's bikes. Chains don't last long enough to get appreciatively dirty and corroded, especially if you're riding 70 miles a week. You should be going through 3-4 chains a year and at that interval they should never need to be degreased unless you ride off-road or in the rain frequently. If your drivetrain is getting that dirty that fast you're either using too much live or too heavy of a lube. Try something silicon or Teflon based and only lube the rollers. One drop per roller should last you about a month and keep your chain clean. Make sure you wipe the chain down when you're done. The outside of the chain needs no lubrication. If you live in a really dusty area you could even dampen a paper towel with rubbing alcohol and run the chain over it to clean the outside of the chain after lubrication to remove sticky residue."
bikewrench,39sza2,sebwiers,3,Sun Jun 14 15:41:16 2015 UTC,"I doubt it's doing harm or good.  70 miles doesn't seem like much, people do more in one ride and obviously don't stop to degree and lube  - what are you doing that you get 'a lot of muck'?  On the other hand, as long as it's fully lubed after, it probably doesn't hurt any, just uses up lube and cleaner.  I suspect you could cut back to cleaning every month or two without any ill effect.  500 miles between cleanings is pretty normal.  You might need special care if you ride off road or otherwise throw muck on the chain, of course."

bikewrench,39sza2,rideweedsmokebikes,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:17:32 2015 UTC,"After reading the following email newsletter I switched from doing what you did(but less frequently) to a less hassle, more effective procedure. What I do now is much more frequently do a quick dry wipe down, and only place two drops between the chain links and use my fingers to spread it on the chain while moving the pedals. Then I gently wipe the side of the chain. I try to make sure there is just enough lube for it not to squeak and just wipe down and re-lube my bikes more often since this procedure is fast. Here is the email where I got valuable info Victor Jimenez who runs the the valueable Cyling360 podcast I received via email:   I know you have heard it before.  ** Squeak Squeak Squeak**  The horrible sound of a squeaky chain. It happens to anyone that has spent a lot of time riding a bike.  A noisy chain is just a symptom of a poorly cared for drivetrain. Really the noise is the least of your worries.  If your chain is not well lubed you are causing unnecessary wear on your chain, cassette, and chainrings.    So how do you avoid that dreaded chain squeak?  Using the correct bicycle chain lube and keeping the chain clean is the short answer.    The number one mistake that most road and triathlon cyclists make is that they apply too much lube.  Too much lube can be nearly as bad as not enough. With excess lube the chain picks up sand and dirt from the road making a think abrasive paste.  This paste grinds away at your bikes drivetrain causing unequally wear, and a poorly shifting bike.    So how much lube should you use?  The smallest amount of lube possible to keep the chain from squeaking. You should keep it relatively clean.   Also when I do use my Park tool chain cleaning tool, I use LA's LA’s Totally Awesome Orange All-Purpose Degreaser from a dollar store, $1: http://www.dollartree.com/LA-s-Totally-Awesome-Orange-All-Purpose-Degreaser-Refill-64-oz-/p300084/index.pro Purpose made bike degreasers are too expensive for my blood. Does anyone do something similar and have opinions? Am I using a poorly suited degreaser and wasting my time? It seems to work well, but I never used purpose made bike degreaser...

The advantages are mostly the fact that there are fewer external moving parts (derailleur and such) and therefor needs much less regular maintenance. That one on your bike is manufactured by Shimano, likely the ""333"" model that they put out for years.  When the cable is completely slack, it defaults to the highest gear.

Also, brake housing is coiled, meaning it won't work with indexed shifting. It's fine for a 1970s ten-speed with friction shifters, but on a modern shifter, each ""click"" of the shifter won't pull the correct amount of cable because the cable housing compresses under tension, meaning the derailleur won't line up with the gear.  http://www.bikeman.com/bicycle-repair-tech-info/bikeman-tech-info/1641-cables-a-housing  http://sheldonbrown.com/cables.html"

Only thing that dictates the fork travel is the air shaft length, and the only thing that dictates the fork wheel size is the lowers. Not sure why you'd want RCT3 over the RC. It just limits your ability to tune the fork. If anything, going to the RCT3 is a down-grade in my mind. You'd be better off spending your money on an Ohlins upgrade kit for the damper."
bikewrench,39tpt7,CertifiedUser,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:42:12 2015 UTC,I want the RCT3 so I can have the low speed compression setting. Unless there's a way I can fit just that? Where can I get an Öhlins upgrade? :O
bikewrench,39tpt7,CertifiedUser,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:44:27 2015 UTC,"I guess if you really want it, it doesn't help the fork that much. Where are you in the world? Suspension service shops like NS Dynamics, TFTuned, PUSH etc.. might be suppliers of Ohlins. Edit: Basicly, the compression dial on the RC is a low-speed compression and the LSC dial on the RCT3 only affects the fork in the open setting. So the LSC dial is a mini-adjust inside between the Open and Pedal settings."

Titanium screw kits for RC cars generally say you can replace all the steel screws except the ones bolting the shocks to the chassis and arms. I think a steel bolt should only snap if A. There was a defect in the original bolt (and a new bolt likely won't have that issue) or, B. You're bottoming out your suspension.

I work for a pretty big QBP dealer, I have a 1x1 frame in a box at my feet and a fleet of Fargos on the floor!   The problem is the internal diameter of the head tubes. The fargo has a 44mm head tube (That is what the ZS44 means) it is a standard size for bikes that using tapering steerer tubes on their forks. The stock fargo 3 fork may be a 1-1/8 inch steerer but that is accomplished by using an adapter crown race.  The 1x1 is a more traditional frame and uses a ""1-1/8 threadless standard"" headset according to surly's website...which is less then helpful because what they mean is a EC34/28.6 Headset. Which is about 1 full centimeter smaller then the fargo's headset cups. (EC34 ""External Cup"" 34mm Is far and away the most common 'Standard' for straight head-tubes that accommodate threadless 1-1/8"" steer tubes)    The cups from your 1x1 will not fit into the Fargo they will be too small, and the cups from the Fargo will not fit into the 1x1 they will be too large.  Also cane creek 10's kind of suck, they use plastic crown races and tend to get gritty and dirty and lose adjustment over time. Cane creek 40 would be an awesome upgrade for you."

bikewrench,39q1p8,playeren,-1,Sat Jun 13 19:56:52 2015 UTC,That tech guide says nothing about toeing brake pads. The adjustment screws only center the caliper. That is only half the problem
bikewrench,39q1p8,B1CYCl3R3P41RM4N,0,Sun Jun 14 04:22:52 2015 UTC,"The pad carriers have a convex surface on them and the washer against it should be slightly concave. Shift the pad forward and backwards along the brake track to adjust toe. Pushing them in the direction of the rotation of the wheel should toe them in. Make sure you put some Dri-slide/Tri-Flow on the hardware to keep the pad from rotating and the washers from binding when you tighten the bolt down. That should solve your toeing issues.  As for the brake caliper itself, there are a couple things you should check. Start by putting the spring tension adjusting screws each in the middle of their threading so you can adjust each arm in either direction if needed. Drip some lube on the pivots and move the caliper arms with your hand. You should hopefully feel some reduction in friction. You can be fairly liberal with the lube, but apply it in spurts so that it has a chance to soak in, it does no good all over the caliper or on the shop floor. Proceed to adjust the spring tension if needed. If you're still having issues, remove the caliper and sand the mounting posts with fine grit sand paper. There could be road grit or corrosion on the posts. Reinstall and relube the caliper arms and readjust. Also check and make sure the brake noodle and housing aren't positioned in a way that restricts motion"

To put it in technical terms, while both had the same thread pitch, and while the major diameter of the threads in the crank was correct, the minor diameter of the threads in the crank was just a tiny bit smaller than the other crank, and the two parts had about 0.003"" interference along that point.

I'm 40lbs+ lighter than you and I only do less than 100psi (for 700 x 23) in wet conditions. On 25mm I do 90/95.  Disclosure: Avoiding pinch flats for me it is a priority over comfort.

My racing bike has very thin tires, like you are describing. Those lose air pretty quickly. I might check every day for that. My commuter bike has wider tires and the tubes are thick to ward against punctures. They leak less.  I usually inflate about 10-20 psi lower than the max because I read a scientific study years ago where they found that slightly underflated tires had less rolling resistance. It is counterintuitive and the study's authors were surprised by their findings such that they tested and retested. Rock hard tires were slower by enough to make some difference. I don't think it was crucial, but it was a difference. I wish I could remember where I read it. I think the article was online.  So, my racing bike tires have a max PSI of 120. I inflate to 100-110, front and back. My commuter tires have a max PSI of 90. I inflate to 70-80, front and back."

Sounds hard, but one adapts quickly.  The reason the switch is there is in case something happens during a ride which screws up the indexing. Something snags a cable, or the derailleur takes a bash, and suddenly bad shifting. Switch to friction and you can shift through most of your gears and get home in time for beer."

bikewrench,39l9vw,Aun_vre,2,Fri Jun 12 18:37:54 2015 UTC,Sometimes the shape of some pads can interfere with the shape of some rotors.   Specifically Shimano is 'avid' (haha) that their brake rotors are incompatible with SRAM/Avid's brake calipers.   But often there is a simple fix. If you want to use Shimano ice-tec rotors with your mechanical BB7s you simply need to clip the tab at the bottom of each brake pad so it does not hit the rivets on the shimano rotor...  In short you can make almost any rotor work with almost any caliper on the market.
bikewrench,39jz90,alphster,3,Fri Jun 12 06:53:57 2015 UTC,"First off... Why the fuck are you peddling backwards man! Joking aside, yes the top pulley wheel should float. It aids shifting.

However, if your jockey wheel is causing a visible variation in the chain-line between it and the cassette, it's entirely possible that something is wrong. It might not be the part though. Some things you should check:   how old is your chain? Is your dérailleur hanger straight? how about the dérailleur cage? when you took he jockey wheel off. Did you replace all of the pieces correctly? Are you possibly missing the bushing that they're supposed to ride on? it's also entirely possible that the problem is actually a symptom of bad set-up.

The spring of the derailleur has less power than the pressure a finger can apply on the shifter. Add to that a little cable friction and you're going to wait a long time until you get that easier gear.  It's also far easier for a spring to pull the derailleur down towards the smallest sprockets than up towards the bigger ones.  The ""rapid rise"" design is absurd from the get go."
bikewrench,39h0fu,audiocycle,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:44:17 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong here...   Normal derailleurs have the spring pulling down towards the smallest cog. Shifting to a larger cog requires you to fight the spring of the derailleur.   Rapid Rise have the whole thing reversed. The spring pulls towards the largest cog, thus making shifts to larger cogs that much easier."
bikewrench,39h0fu,leicanthrope,-1,Fri Jun 12 04:01:47 2015 UTC,"I agree up until that last comma.  The spring has a limited pulling power that is inferior to that of the finger(s) pushing a shift lever. Once you take in account friction in the housing and derailleur pivots along with spring fatigue you get a deficient system.  The problem is not fighting the return spring, it is managing to push the derailleur on a bigger cog. While it is true there is a spring we push against in that movement, it does not offer much resistance. It is the ""pivot spring"" and it is not the same as the one in the parallelogram that's pulls towards the smallest cog.  TL;DR: It's harder for the derailleur to go on the larger sprockets and our thumb is stronger than the spring."
bikewrench,39h0fu,audiocycle,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:49:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to stand up for the system, or trying to sell it to anyone. I'm not saying that it even worked, I'm just trying to explain my understanding of what the logic was for the basic idea behind it.   Of course your fingers are stronger than the springs in the dérailleur. Otherwise it would be rather impossible to shift the damn things. That wasn't my point.   If you ever have the opportunity to use a friction system with a normal dérailleur you'll see that it physically takes more effort to shift onto a big cog. In one direction you're pulling with the spring, and the other you're pulling against it. Shifting ends up being a hair faster in one direction as a result. The Rapid Rise, at least in theory, reverses the direction it's pulling to make it easier and faster to shift to a big cog instead."

The lockring should be closed with a very high torque (40nm) so if you have play in the cassette after closing the lockring, you probably need more spacers. Every wheel manufacturer has different freehub designs so check it with the manufacturer of the hub. But the main idea is: no play = good, play = no good.   Coming to the RD tune up, you have four things to set up in this order: h-screw, l-screw, b-screw, barrel adjuster. You're using the same cassette so don't touch the b-screw.

They work by simply coating the steel so oxygen and water can't get to it. They are most effective when applied to a non-rusted surface, but they will also help retard light surface rust.  You simply spray liberally into the tubes, rotate the bike in all directions to get the entire inside surface coated, then let the excess drain out. When the light solvent ""flashes"" off, the thick lube will be left behind coating the tubes.  Application can be messy, and it's a lot easier to do with a bare frame than an assembled bike. You'll need to reapply periodically. How often depends on your environment but probably every couple years.  If you do all that your frame will probably last 50 years. If you don't, it may only make it 30 years :) In other words, unless you plan to keep the bike a really long time, it may not be worth the trouble (unless you ride in a harsh environment or you're like me and just enjoy bike maintenance)."

If your gear changes are ""rough,"" you should get that diagnosed.  Whatever's causing your rough shifts may wear out your components much faster than cross chaining.  If you're not comfortable adjusting the derailleurs, you may want to take it to a shop to have them look at it.    Regarding cross-chaining, the general consensus on an 11 speed would be to run the big ring (50t) on your lowest 6 cogs (11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18) and your small ring (34t) on your highest 6 cots (18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 32).  Depending on your frames geometry, how your FD is adjusted, and how the planets are aligned on any particular day, you should be able to ride on the 7th cog without issue.  That is, the 20 on your 50, and the 16 on your 32.  But, since you're a new cyclist (welcome to the madness!), my advice, FWIW, is not to worry about it.  Shift away to your heart's content, finding a set of gears your comfortable in for whatever the conditions call for.  There's plenty of other skills you'll be learning while you get better at riding, and worrying about what cog/ring you're in all the time will just add to the confusion.    Buy a chain wear indicator (they are $2.50 USD shipped on eBay) and check your chain from time to time.  Chances are, even as a new cyclist, you won't be cross chaining enough to do any noticeable extra wear."

If it's a noticable problem for a while I'll mention it to Giant at my 4 to 6 week first service.

bikewrench,39f6vm,DJ-Dev1ANT,3,Thu Jun 11 14:05:23 2015 UTC,"Avoiding cross-chaining on newer chainsets is mostly a matter of common sense, not specific ratios, particularly since the optimum gearing depends mostly on your strength and the gradient of the road. The most important thing is that the most used gear (the gear you use while at cruising speed) keeps your chain relatively straight. Unless you're riding very slowly, very VERY quickly or constantly riding up a 30% incline, then this is probably already the case.    What I would do is get into the big chainring, get up to your cruising speed and look at what gear you are in. As long as you're not in the two largest cogs on the cassette, it's not going to have a significant effect on the wear of your drivetrain. If you can't maintain a straight chainline in the big ring, shift into the 34 chainring instead, get up to cruise speed again and check the angle of your chain. As long as you're not in the smallest two gears, again it won't affect the wear significantly.    If you find the chain is rubbing against the front derailleur you may need to trim as you move through the gears.  As for smooth shifting, there are four things I would recommend:     When shifting, ensure you press the black lever inwards firmly and fully, then release it immediately Modern drivetrains are designed to shift under full load, but dialling down the torque being applied to your pedal rotation while shifting can help give a smoother shift If the above two points aren't working for you, give your drivechain a good clean with degreaser, lubricate your chain well, and try again. If it's still shifting poorly, your derailleur may need adjusting. If your shift cables are over a year old, replacing them could restore better shifting."

bikewrench,39f6vm,nhluhr,2,Thu Jun 11 15:20:25 2015 UTC,"Since you say you're a new cyclist I'm going to jump to this conclusion:  #1 you aren't really 'getting' the front shifter's trim positions and how/when you moves between them as you shift.  #2 there's a DAMN good chance that your shifting simply isn't set up correctly because as much as we like to say bike mechanics are good at what they do, some of us pay closer attention to detail than others and frankly, these new Shimano 11 spd setups require more steps than before.  The fine tuning is a little bit more demanding than the older stuff.  Now to expand one #1 -- The front shifter has basically 4 positions.    One is the full Low position, derailleur furthest left, which is meant for the 34 ring and your bigger (easier cogs).    The next one (accessed by pushing the shifter just until you feel the small click) is the Low-Trim position which is meant for the 34 ring with your smaller (harder) cogs.    The next position up/right from Low-Trim is High-Trim although getting into this position actually normally requires going to full High and then clicking down a half click.  Either way, High-Trim is meant for the 50 ring with the bigger (easier cogs).    Finally, we have the full High position, derailleur furthest right, which is meant for the 50 ring and the smaller (harder cogs).  As you're starting from the lowest gears (34 ring and big cogs) and you shift to smaller/harder cogs, you'll eventually get to one that starts to make a chain rubbing noise.  That noise is the chain brushing the front derailleur.  Now is the time to go into Low-Trim.  Just a half push of the front shifter until you feel that click.  If operating your shifter to this small click doesn't result in your derailleur actually moving a bit to the right but rather it just looks like your cable tensions up some more, your shifter is NOT adjusted properly.  Correctly setup though, the derailleur moves slightly right and alleviates that rubbing sound.  Eventually you're gonna want to move to the big chainring.  Push that shifter again (this time it'll likely just go all the way to full High).  You should be good to go.  The range of overlap in the system means going from Low-Trim somewhere in the middle of the cassette to High will result in no rubbing.  If you go to smaller cogs from there you'll continue to have no rubbing.  On the other hand if you're in the big ring and you need to use an easier cog to get over a little roller of an incline or something, you can do that too - just move to the bigger cog and then when the chain rubbing starts, use the High-Trim position by hitting the half click on the smaller lever of the front shifter.  Now as you find yourself wanting to go back to the small chainring, something that is important to know is that with the new 11spd shifters, Shimano has made it so that the first small-ring position you go to from the big ring is the Low-Trim position.  This is normally fine in the context of how you'd normally make your shift jumps from big ring to small ring along with the requisite rear shift to 1 or 2 smaller cog (to keep the gear ratio jump from being too big).  Does that all make sense?  OK now to expand on #2 --  I said the new setups are more demanding to setup.  Specifically the new front derailleur is the thing.  First of all, if your bike uses a braze-on type front derailleur, you need to know about the 'support bolt' and adhesive backup plate for the support bolt.  This is generally NOT installed from the factory and a lot of shops are forgetting to do these for new bike builds.  The point of the support bolt is to brace the derailleur against twisting on its mount and therefore making it more stable and controlling against the chain.  It's kinda like a second leg for the derailleur to steady itself against the frame.  Installing it requires first setting the height of the derailleur, then bolting it so that the cage is slightly angled inward.  Then turn the bolt in to find where to stick the backup plate (a curved one or flat one to choose from) and then turn the bolt against the plate to make the cage parallel.  The next 'new' thing for setting up the front derailleur is the cable clamp 'converter' mode.  This requires using a special tool (TL-FD68) and the instruction manual (available at si.shimano.com) to first measure the angle the cable comes to the derailleur and then choose the correct clamping position.  If it's not in the correct position, shifting won't be optimal.  This is also something I've seen coming from the factory on new bikes set incorrectly.  Finally, the front derailleur does require a significant amount of 'pretension' in the cable to make the trim position work correctly.  This is normally accomplished by turning the L limit screw in to move the derailleur into a further-right position then clamping the cable with a good amount of tension before turning the L limit screw back to its correct position.  Finally, fine-tune it with an inline barrel adjuster that should be installed somewhere on the front shift cable/housing.  Make sure you're using an 'indexed' inline adjuster (one with clicks) to prevent it unintentionally backing itself out on its own."

bikewrench,39h6jn,55555thatisfivefives,2,Thu Jun 11 19:00:15 2015 UTC,Recently bought a Windsor Single Speed Cockwork.   Oh yeah?
bikewrench,39h6jn,icanhazroadbike,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:28:03 2015 UTC,Look on craigslist and eBay and /r/bikeshop.   What type of brakes does the bike currently use? You con't want to use anything with hoods on bullhorns. You should be able to find some standard BMX style or bar-end brake levers pretty cheap.
bikewrench,39ckiw,lavaslippers,2,Wed Jun 10 21:17:19 2015 UTC,You're going the right direction.   You should try the penetrating lubricant because that looks pretty corroded.

bikewrench,39ckiw,nowhere3,2,Wed Jun 10 21:28:45 2015 UTC,Probably not really.  I've found that heating the bottom bracket shell for a few minutes with a propane torch to be the most effective solution for getting stuck bottom brackets out.

bikewrench,39ckiw,nowhere3,2,Wed Jun 10 21:38:38 2015 UTC,Try a freezing & penetrating lubricant like: http://www.henkelna.com/industrial/product-search-1554.htm?nodeid=8797940809729 if you're worried about damaging the paint.  Heating will definitely damage the paint.

I'll add one thing.. if there's any way you can manage (even if it's just a skewer through the holes in the axle, or threading a bolt in), you should try to affix the removal tool squarely onto the frame to prevent it camming out before you put it under heavy load.  Once you destroy those teeth, things get really hard."

It still takes some patience but they helped a lot. And no extra cost."
bikewrench,39aldh,Mesquite_Skeet_Skeet,2,Wed Jun 10 16:30:30 2015 UTC,I stick a bit of cotton thread on the end of the old cable before I remove it and pull it through. Then stick the cotton that's now running through the frame onto the new cable and (gently) pull that back through. Works a treat.

bikewrench,39aldh,rideweedsmokebikes,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:17:35 2015 UTC,"I use magnets, a spoke, some masking tape and a brake cable to make the job generally pretty easy.  Feed the brake cable in through the cable port you're trying to route. Use the magnet to manipulate the cable in the tube(be careful not to scratch the paint on the frame)and the cable to fish it out. I find it's easiest to push the cable past the exit port and hook the j bend of the spoke around the cable then draw the cable backwards in the tube until the head of the brake cable gets hooked. Now you tape the tail of the cable you fed to the cable you want to run and pull it through. Good luck."

Did the mechanic check your cables and housing? If your shifter cables are slacking and the housing is fraying, the shifting will turn to crap during the first ride.   I've learned the hard way that the adjustments don't last because the riding pressures undo the setup I have given it in the shop. New cables, new housing often are the solution. Gives you a chance to lubricate your shifters and start fresh.  Don't forget to the check the derailleur hanger and that the front derailleur is parallel to the chainring.  New components should always make an improvement, if nothing changes, inspect the things you didn't change. Good luck!"

bikewrench,39d1nq,kopsis,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:30:11 2015 UTC,Depends on how comfortable you are with changing the geometry of your setup. AtC that's too long is going to feel weird because your front end is too high. What's the AtC of the forks you're looking at?

bikewrench,39d1nq,arse_biscuits,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:17:42 2015 UTC,"Going longer will make the steering feel less 'precise' I think is the term, and if you go too far can make climbing steep hills a battle in keeping the front end on the ground (I speak from experience on this one).  You can also get away with going a little bit shorter, but remember this will take away from the clearance your bike has (i.e. your chainrings will now be closer to the floor and stand more chance of being bent on an obstacle).  There is also, apparently, the potential of unforeseen extra load on the head tube because of the forces acting at a different angle than that which it was designed for.  How much difference this really makes I could not tell you.  When I was looking at this sort of problem, the general advice was that about 1 cm won't make much appreciable difference.    EDIT: Only just noticed you are talking road here lol  I guess the clearance thing isn't as much of an issue.  the rest of it pretty much stands though.  I would guess that the geometry on a road bike is a bit less 'changeable' than on an MTB as they are pretty much designed with a specific riding position in mind."

bikewrench,39cd16,CapnScrunch,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:42:39 2015 UTC,"The lever has enough leverage to make the entire brake (and pads) flex, yet there's still not even half the braking power there should be. If a correctly performing cantilever brake were used with a long pull lever, there still would be some braking power, enough to at least slow me down, wouldn't it? I'm starting to think the pads are crappy too."
bikewrench,39cd16,MTFUandPedal,2,Thu Jun 11 08:24:53 2015 UTC,Sounds like all the force you put into the lever goes into flexing the brake caliper. This would be the first BSO to come with brakes that do not work   Just get a fork with proper brake mounts and don't waste your time gilding a turd

bikewrench,39bpvq,DistributorOfPain,5,Wed Jun 10 18:05:40 2015 UTC,To my untrained eye this looks like a pretty nice frame for touring. I think the tab on the fork is for a bottle generator. The ESGE kickstand plate seems to refer to a German manufacturer of kickstands and fenders (they make a pretty nice looking two legged kickstand http://www.commutebybike.com/2013/02/27/esge-kickstand-two-legs-work-better-than-one/).  The tab on the right-hand seat stay has me baffled unless it's for a chain guard.  I'm thinking the frame was resprayed at one point in it's life and they only bothered putting the Reynolds sticker on it but I'm sure there are plenty of small builders out there that do not have custom decals for their product.
bikewrench,39bpvq,singlejeff,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:08:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response!!  I was wondering if that was for some sort of electrical component (light mount, bottle generator, etc.) but most of the fork tabs I've seen were smaller. And yeah, the paint doesn't quite look original, which is fine since I plan on getting it powdercoated and sealed. I heard back from the seller and he thinks that it's a Cilo frame but he's not 100% about it either. In any case, my verdict was the same as yours, it should do fine...I plan on building it up with newer Deore/XT componentry."
bikewrench,39atjo,stevenlongs,2,Wed Jun 10 14:19:54 2015 UTC,"No, ""full tune-up clean-up"" is not standard from shop to shop.  Most shops, but not all, will offer a basic ""adjust brakes and shifting"" package.  Others will do multiple levels of tunes that get you more bang for the buck.  Others will do everything a la carte. Your second question is really hard to answer.  For a bike ridden constantly and given regular maintenance, ideally no service needs to be performed, because if you're maintaining it regularly, you're doing everything that needs to be done as it needs to be done.  Do the cables need to be replaced?  I don't know, how are they performing?"

bikewrench,39atjo,chocolatemeowcats,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:47:02 2015 UTC,"Typically at our shop our Tune Up costs only cover labor. Cable runs are lubed and freed, and if we need to change them the customer is told before hand and we charge extra for parts. Bearings are the same way- for our $90 package they are repacked, but if they need to be replaced than we charge for the bearings.   $150 is what we call our ""Restoration Package"" in which that's probably the only bike that one of our mechanics will have in the stand for that day. It's typically about 4-5 hours of labor with a full clean, polish of any chrome on older bikes, repacking and adjustment of all bearings, the whole 9.  Labor and parts are two separate costs completely. We make money off labor. The margin of profit on replacement parts (bearings, cables, housing, brake pads) is like 20% in our shop."

bikewrench,39atjo,Mizrul,2,Sun Jun 14 21:15:10 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think that these sort of ""pro tune-up"" packages are a marketing scam. Not to say that they don't work, but often times they are unnecessary.  Even if your bike has not been ridden in many years, as long as it has been stored in a good environment there likely is not much that needs to be done. You can easily buy a Park Tool brush and chain cleaner for the cost of the cleaning service by your LBS. Use some simple green or dish soap as cleaning solution, and just scrub down your drivetrain with the brush and a hose. Afterwards, a light coat of chain lube will keep it turning silently.  Check your chain with a ruler, look for rust on your frame and wheels. Check the shifting just by going through it yourself. If you feel it isn't up to par, you can adjust it pretty easily yourself. Otherwise, most bike shops will do just a ""derailleur adjustment"" for $15-$30 depending on what the issues are.  If you want to be thorough about it, you can even install new cable and housing quite easily (pretty much just measure and cut). A Park Tool cable cutter will cost about the same as what the shop will charge, and it lasts you for life. That being said, cables don't really need to be replaced that often. I ride year-round and only change my brake cable about once a year, and the shifters when I feel that the shifting is getting cranky. Otherwise, unless the housing is cracked or the cable is frayed, I would leave it.   Brakes are extremely easy to work on; they were the first thing I did on my own. Youtube has too many great videos on adjusting and maintaining just about any type of brake you can think of. It's pretty obvious whether they are working or not...  While most tune-ups will say they ""check and add fresh grease to bearings,"" nowadays most bikes have sealed bearings and can't really be repacked. Either they are good or they have to be replaced. Simply just feel for a grinding sensation in the bearings, and you will know whether or not they need to be replaced. If they do, just take it to the shop and they can swap them out for about $25.  Basically, for under $50, you can do a complete tune-up of your bike on your own and have a complete assessment of your bike. Remember, a bike is just two wheels and some gears: Do your wallet a favor and don't be afraid of some light DIY maintenance."
bikewrench,39atjo,jgan96,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:24:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the writeup!  I started riding a bicycle last year and pretty new in terms of riding and bike maintenance. I'm not afraid to look up videos on how to do stuff or sift through the owners manual for information. I can get my gears adjusted (re-index?) and take care of my bikes by keeping them clean and lubed. What I do lack is obviously experience and the knowledge of a professional so sometimes when I'm not sure I just bring it to the shop. Other times, it is simply because I lack the tools to do the work myself. Stuff like torquing to spec the carbon I'd almost like to do myself because I feel like I'd be more careful and precise with what I'm doing and it's not reasonable to expect the same amount of care from someone who has a whole list of projects awaiting him.  I'm thinking for over 100$ for a tune up, whatever it may be, I think I should just save up for some of the tools. I have two bikes currently and I feel like there's always some thing I'd like to have done but I would have to bring it to the shop. For example I just had to change the chain and cassette on my 1999 saeco bike which the LBS helped me do. On my other bike the plastic disc in the back has become unhinged slightly and is starting to put stress on the spokes so I would like to get that removed but I was told I need to take the cassette off for that. Since I don't have those wrenches needed to pry the cassette open I can't do that myself...anyways I'm rambling.  I always heard about those end of season / pre-season tune ups and so I was wondering what kind of maintenance services needed to be accomplished...and reading from this thread it seems that the prices are also dependent on the shop itself.  I would prefer to be able to do at least some of the wrenching myself. Would you have any recommendations as for tools that would be useful or must haves? As for advice /r/bikewrench has always been incredibly patient and kind to me, and I appreciate that!"
bikewrench,39atjo,jgan96,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:59:01 2015 UTC,"Obviously a set of metric hex keys and screwdrivers are necessary. Otherwise, the only truly essential part of my toolbox really is just my workstand. That and a brush are the only tools I need to clean a bike.  Cable cutters, chain whips, cassette tools are all tools I acquired just as I needed them. You will get a feel pretty quickly of what you will be using frequently and what it is better to let a shop do.  For example, I always go to my shop if I need to install a new fork and need the crown race pulled or a starnut installed just because they are things I will almost never do. Bearings and bottom brackets I also take to the shop because the tools can be pretty specialized, and with proper maintenance they will last many many seasons on their own.  I guess I would say that the only tools you should invest in are ones for your drivetrain. That is usually the most frequently adjusted and worn out component, and you can save a ton of money doing it yourself. Remember, even if you do mess it up, your bike shop is still there to correct the issue."
bikewrench,39atjo,Mizrul,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:16:11 2015 UTC,"As much as I agree with that from a Mechanic's standpoint, I completely disagree with that. Yes, I started on youtube videos and learning how to do it myself. The problem with that is that most of the people that are teaching other people to work on their bikes don't know the proper way to do things themselves.   For example- not to be an asshole, but simply to nitpick- NEVER. EVER. Use dish soap on a drivetrain. It's a degreaser. A chain is packed full of grease at the factory, and the second you take a degreaser to that chain, it wipes all of the grease from within it. Just because your chain looks clean and slightly moist does NOT mean that it's properly lubed.  Secondly, Until you hit the $1500 point in a bicycle, most bearings are going to be loose ball setups. Hell even my Giant Talon 1 is loose ball for everything except for the headset, and that's only because I installed that aftermarket after blowing up my bearings.   My shop offers two separate tune up packages, a $60 package and a $90. The difference between the two is that in the $90 all bearing races are opened, repacked, and readjusted, and all cable runs are lubed completely.   Ask me how much more difficult it is to tune up a bike when you can't add new grease to a bearing race because someone wouldn't spring the extra $30 for a much better deal.  I'm not saying don't wrench on your bike, but don't put quality bike shops labor down."
bikewrench,39atjo,jgan96,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:22:45 2015 UTC,"Are you saying you never clean your drivetrain? Yes, dish soap is a degreaser, and that is because it is supposed to remove dirty, excess, and broken down lubricant. While I agree the best lubricant for your chain is from the factory, it is not meant to last a lifetime. When it wears down, it should be cleaned and replaced, just like the motor oil in your car. A properly lubricated and functioning drivetrain should be clean and shiny, not black and gunky.  And even if you have loose ball bearings, they are very easy to service and repack yourself. A cone wrench is $20, and if you're lucky and happen to have 15mm cones, you can even use a pedal wrench which is even cheaper. IMO and from what I have seen at my local collective, taking apart and lubricating moving parts becomes second nature after you have done it a couple times."
bikewrench,39atjo,onseali,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:59:03 2015 UTC,"I find that overhauling is only needed on really old bikes, where the grease gets gummed up, or with bikes ridden in wet/dirty conditions, where the grease gets contaminated. Are those the kind of bikes he is doing that $160 job on? Otherwise, it's probably just a way to bring in more cash, and he could probably skip the bearing work."

bikewrench,3996ti,lenipls,3,Wed Jun 10 04:02:32 2015 UTC,"That looks like a really large cog at the back. I would start there, that's the cheapest option. That looks like it might be a 20T? I would drop to a 16 or even a 14T (T=number of teeth). If you go smaller at the rear you'll go faster. You need a single cog made to fit a freehub body. They look like this: http://static.jensonusa.com/images/Default-Image/Zoom/2/CS307C00.jpg  Your front crankset looks like the type that doesn't have removable chain rings. If it does, I would remove the large chain ring, and put it in place of the middle chain ring. You can remove the small ring altogether. However, given that none of that was done and the type of crankset I think I see in the picture, you may have a riveted chainring setup which is not modifiable.   Alternatively, you could attempt to put a shorter bottom bracket in the frame (to move the crankset closer to the frame, looks like there's ""some"" room to do so) which may let you use the large chain ring as the drive ring instead of the middle.  You want to have a straight chain line (when viewed from the rear of the bike)."

bikewrench,3996ti,dirtbagcyclist,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:18:53 2015 UTC,"1/8 and 3/32 refer to the width of the teeth on the cog. If this is your original chain, get the 3/32 one. 1/8"" chain is usually single speed specific, your old multi-speed chain is 3/32"". You may have to shorten your chain, but not necessarily replace it."

bikewrench,39a77w,fryktelig,2,Wed Jun 10 10:49:19 2015 UTC,Road brake lever sometimes called aero or drop bar road brake levers. Models include:Shimano BL-R400 / tektro RL340 / Sram s500 / TRP RRL brake levers.

bikewrench,3998pm,onseali,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:33:52 2015 UTC,"You might just need a tune up. I'm not 100% sure, but I don't think grip shifters can get gummed up like trigger shifters. I've had no problems with them, but I always find useless trigger shifters on old bikes. Trigger shifters are definitely better in my opinion though. As for that price, that sounds about right.

bikewrench,397fh6,wem91,5,Tue Jun 9 20:15:19 2015 UTC,Sounds like it could be an issue in the bearings or the stack itself.    Possibility: Between bearing races and the steer tube spacers there's often a unique (compression) spacer in between that.  It sounds like it's possible yours is missing/broken.   A pic of what you have would be helpful in further diagnostics.

In a very rare case it could be the bearing crown race where the steer-tube meets the fork wasn't installed properly.  But that's less likely.   Edit: Called steertube downtube by mistake."
bikewrench,395ujm,bunkcephus,2,Tue Jun 9 13:51:26 2015 UTC,"Have a single speed Fuji Regis from the 80s. I think (according to Sheldon Brown) that it has sealed bearings. Would it just be a matter of measuring by bracket shell and buying a sealed bearing set that fits?   Pretty much. It's fairly safe to assume you have an English/ISO threaded bottom bracket. Chances are your BB shell is 68mm wide – oversized shells like 70 or 73mm are mostly found on mountain bikes – but measure just to be sure.  The other important dimension is the spindle width, which determines how far apart your crank arms will sit. You should match this, unless you want to change your crank spacing (and your chainline and F derailleur will support moving the chainrings).   Would I run into any problems with the crankset not fitting correctly, or different types of nuts and bolts?   You shouldn't. Your bike almost assuredly has square taper cranks, which are standardized.   My apologies if some of this information is readily available or if my questions don't make sense. Just getting started learning how to do my own repairs.   No worries, bottom brackets are one of the more annoying things to replace on an older bicycle due to the huge amount of different standards that have existed over the years, and the fact that more than one dimension is necessary to spec them.  One more thing. You may find that the cranks do not simply pop off once you remove the bolts that fix them on the BB. You might want to consider spending 20 bucks on a crank puller, which really makes it easier to remove the cranks. Otherwise, a 2x4 and a hammer will usually remove a crank, but with more risk of marring/cracking something."
bikewrench,395ujm,howmanydads,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:03:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much. This is great and what I needed to know.   While a hammer and a 2x4 are certainly closer to my style, I'll take your advice for the crank puller. Ride safe."
bikewrench,395ujm,Hagenaar,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:17:21 2015 UTC,"Your bike almost assuredly has square taper cranks, which are standardized.   They are standardised into three standards, JIS normal/low profile and ISO, which are not fully interchangeable. As it's a Fuji, a Shimano JIS cartridge will probably work unless the cranks are NJS Sugino or older Dura Ace.   Otherwise, a 2x4 and a hammer will usually remove a crank, but with more risk of marring/cracking something.   Do not do this on a bike you care about."

This is a very low stress part, merely holding the front derailleur in place. It almost looks like it's the back side of the screw hole to hold the derailleur on. My guess is this is an aluminum frame and water will have little effect, it does not appear to be a hole into the seat tube."
bikewrench,395zor,Hiroschima,8,Tue Jun 9 14:31:58 2015 UTC,"I'll throw this out there, but I don't know if there's a separate set of steps for a 1x set up. The standard way of checking is to wrap the chain around the two largest cogs without looping through the derailleur. Add two whole links, and there you go, perfect chain length. With a 1x, it sends like the logic would be just as sound. The front D doesn't offer any pull on the chain, so not having one shouldn't affect it at all.   Perhaps your b-limit screw isn't set correctly? That adjusts the angle of the dangle of your derailleur. If it's set too slack, there might be some slap when you're in a smaller cog.   I just recently set up a 1x for road riding, and I used that method to set my chain length, with no problems. There might be someone out there with better answers for you."

bikewrench,395zor,RedBeardedHawk,3,Wed Jun 10 08:05:07 2015 UTC,"B screw adjustment, check that. If your chain appears too short in the granny gear, it probably is. When the chain is in granny gear, the pulley should be far enough away that when the chain approaches the pulley the very next roller shouldn't have much space above it in the cassette. Your setup sounds like it's not pushing the pitch of the derailleur far enough down, which will take up some of that slack when the chain is on the smallest cog."

bikewrench,397850,shufflingmulligan,3,Tue Jun 9 19:27:47 2015 UTC,"first, check that ""crack"" and see if it is where the rim was bonded together- aluminum rims are flat at first and rolled into shape, then bonded at a point. here's a visualized explanation.  if the rim itself is actually cracked then yep, you should replace it. so, did you do it running over something or could it be replaced under warranty? if the former, a decent complete rear aluminum rim will normally start around 60 bucks BUT your bike has disk brakes so add another 25 or so- plus whatever the shop will charge for swapping over the cassette/brake disk. and it's kind of a coin toss if they'll have it in black.  it's my opinion that for your bike, pretty much anything that comes prebuilt with a hub for disc brakes will have what you need: sealed bearings, a double walled rim, and stainless steel spokes. you can easily blow a few hundred bucks on a replacement rear wheel, and my advice is don't.  but make sure the rim is actually busted and you're not just seeing the seam- if you had caliper brakes it'd feel like a speed bump on every revolution but you can totally get away with it on discs. a picture may help!  -->edited for ""former/latter"" confusion. d'oh!"

bikewrench,395xyg,onespeeder,2,Wed Jun 10 18:07:55 2015 UTC,"Generally it's prudent to replace the entire drivetrain together.  The chain, cogs, and chainrings wear together, so when you just replace the chain it no longer fits properly into the gears, and you get slip under load.  That's likely what's happening.  At 4500 km I suppose it really matters how much time you spent in the gears in question.  Probably most of it I would guess.    it's an annoying fact, and one I doubted when I first heard it from a mechanic long ago, but it's true."
bikewrench,395xyg,mellett68,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:47:29 2015 UTC,My guess is the teeth have been worn away and the new chain is not sitting on them correctly. Had that on my fixed cog.

bikewrench,395xyg,insideouthoodie,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:08:15 2015 UTC,"Lean your bike up against the wall with the drive side out. Position your self so you are looking toward the front of the bike. Put your left arm on the saddle to weight the bike. With the cranks parallel to the ground and the right crank forward, push down on the pedal while looking at the chain on the chainring. Do it several times and watch to see if the chain rises up the teeth of the ring. If you see it rise more than 2mm, the teeth have been misshapen enough that it is time for a new ring. Do this to all the rings on your crankset (single, double or triple) to see if they are worn. Typically with regular chain replacement you can get several chains out of a cassette and chain rings."

bikewrench,394bu1,B1CYCl3R3P41RM4N,2,Tue Jun 9 05:58:07 2015 UTC,"Re: squeaky wheel. A lot of rims are rolled pieces of alloy that start as straight material are bent into a circular rim. There's a pin inserted between the ends and then the rim is hammered so that it pinches the pin and keeps the rim together. This joint often isn't welded (because a wheel works in tension so the spokes help keep the rim together anyway) so sometimes the pin or rim will squeak a bit.   To fix the squeaking, most of the time you can take a flattened punch or something equally hard but small and flat and just hammer the rim down onto the pin harder. You can find this place by taking the tire and tube off, then looking at the rim and seeing where the joint is- you'll know it when you see it. The places to hammer are the two dots in the rim bed where the rim was originally pushed in."

That said, you'll still be creeping up toward the price of used bike with each part you buy, and if you have to go to a mechanic, you'll definitely be hitting that price point.  So if you don't want to do the work yourself... save yourself time and headache and buy a used bike off Craigslist.  Another option for you would be if you have a bike co-op near you, where someone can help assess the problem, teach you how to fix it, and may even have the parts on hand.  Check this option first.

bikewrench,393z9u,TheBicyclist,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:00:31 2015 UTC,"Section 9. Spoke length of article  Spoke:       When building a bicycle wheel, the spokes must have the correct length, otherwise there may not be enough threads engaged, producing a weaker wheel, or they may protrude through the rim and possibly puncture the inner tube.  For bicycle spokes, the spoke length is defined from the flange seat to the thread tip. For spokes with bent ends, the nominal spoke length does not include the width of the spoke at the bent end.  For wheels with crossed spokes (which are the norm), the desired spoke length is     where   d = distance from the center of hub (along the axis) to flange, for example 30 mm, r1 = spoke hole circle radius of the hub, for example 35 mm, r2 = half of effective Rim Diameter (ERD), or the diameter the ends of the spokes make in a built wheel (see 'Discussion' attached to this article for explanation) of the rim, for example 301 mm, r3 = radius of spoke holes in the flange, for example 1.1 mm, m = number of spokes to be used for one side of the wheel, for example 36/2=18, k = number of crossings per spoke, for example 3 and a = 360° k/m, for example 360°*3/18 = 60°.   Regarding d: For a symmetric wheel such as a front wheel with no disc brake, this is half the distance between the flanges. For an asymmetric wheel such as a front wheel with disc brake or a rear wheel with chain derailleur, the value of d is different for the left and right sides.  a is the angle between (1) the radius to a nipple hole in the rim to which a spoke is attached, and, (2) the radius to the flange hole holding the spoke. The spoke crosses either 1, 2, or 3 oppositely pointing spokes depending on the lacing design. On the flange, the angle between the radii of adjacent holes is 360°/m (for equally spaced holes). For each spoke crossed, the hub is rotated with reference to the rim one ""angle between adjacent flange holes"". Thus, multiplying the ""angle between adjacent flange holes"" by k gives the angle a. For example, a 32 spoke wheel has 16 spokes per side, 360° divided by 16 equals 22.5°. Multiply 22.5° (""angle between adjacent flange holes"") by the number of crossings to get the angle a—if 3-crosses, the 32 spoke wheel has an angle a of 67.5°. Regarding r3: The size of the spoke holes in the flange does not matter for the needed spoke length. This term removes the effect of the hole size. Since the holes are usually small (just over 2 mm in diameter), the effect is small and in practice matters little.  For radially spoked wheels (zero crossings), the formula simplifies to the Pythagorean theorem, with spoke length l being the slope, r2 minus r1 being the base, and d being the rise:   ; or if deducting the rim spoke hole radius from the rise    The spoke length formula computes the length of the space diagonal of an imaginary rectangular box. Imagine holding a wheel in front of you such that a nipple is at the top. Look at the wheel from along the axis. The spoke through the top hole is now a diagonal of the imaginary box. The box has a depth of d, a height of r2-r1cos(α) and a width of r1sin(a).  Equivalently, the law of cosines may be used to first compute the length of the spoke as projected on the wheel's plane (as illustrated in the diagram), followed by an application of the Pythagorean theorem.

bikewrench,393xun,nowhere3,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:01:53 2015 UTC,"The claim that a greased spindle will enlarge the bore of a crank and ultimately reduce chainwheel clearance is also specious, because the crank cannot operate in a plastic stress level that would soon split the crank in use. However, increased engagement depth (hole enlargement) may occur without lubricant, because installation friction could ream the hole.  With or without lubricant, in use, cranks will make metal-to-metal contact with the spindle, causing fretting erosion of the steel spindle for all but the lightest riders. Lubricating the spindle for assembly assures a predictable press fit for a given torque. Without lubrication, the press is unknown, and galling (aluminum transfer to the steel spindle) may occur during assembly. After substantial use, spindle facets may show rouge and erosion from aluminum oxide from the crank, showing that lubricant was displaced.   No one should be propagating the myth that you shouldn't be greasing bottom bracket spindles anymore.

Derailleur chains are thinner (traditionally 3/32"").  Therefore you must decide in advance whether you are going to use a chainring, chain and sprocket all in one size, or all in the other, or a mixture (possible in certain configurations but not advisable).  Next, you must figure out how to tension the chain. Your frame has vertical dropouts and single-speeds have no tensioning arm on a derailleur to pick up the slack. You can add a dedicated tensioner, or just cut and shut the chain to the nearest-to-correct length. It is actually possible, if necessary, to buy ""half links"" (normally chain links are in pairs, this is one link that replaces a pair but is the same length as half a pair, i.e. one link long).  The running of your existing crank arm with one ring is, as you will quickly realise, not the biggest problem.  Running single speed effectively requires a new back wheel. That isn't cheap. Reasonable price budget derailleurs and cassettes are not very expensive.  Therefore, how about just removing the front derailleur, converting the front end to single-ring, but keeping the rear end standard using budget replacement parts?"
bikewrench,392z8m,severs1966,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:52:03 2015 UTC,"Definitely something to consider, according to the LBS I need to replace the cassette and the chainring for sure.  I guess I was hoping it is a debate between a new cassette or cog / spacers / tensioner, as either way I would only end up with one on the front.  For a SS do I need a completely new rear wheel or can I salvage anything from the current one? I was under the impression I would be able to slide off the cassette and put on the spacers / cog."
bikewrench,392z8m,severs1966,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:21:33 2015 UTC,"You could, in principle, remove and dismantle your current cassette and put one sprocket back on with appropriate spacers.  The point I was making is that a new budget cassette and derailleur (and maybe a gear wire) is not so much money. The cost of a dedicated chain tensioner that isn't a derailleur will not be pifflingly cheap. Those things are not made and sold in vast numbers like derailleurs. So unless you can get your chain length just right without a tensioner, you may find that the benefits of having a few gears justify the expense of keeping multiple gears at the rear."
bikewrench,3914mu,Hansel555,2,Mon Jun 8 14:13:16 2015 UTC,"You replaced the cables? You might just need to adjust them, in this case by adding a little more tension"
bikewrench,3914mu,smayple,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:47:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, but this is when the front cable is totally slack, i.e. in low gear. And I have the derailleur low adjustment screw set such that the derailleur is furthest to the left, i.e. toward the non-drive side.  EDIT: so it seems to me I either need to bring the derailleur more to the non-drive side to stop the chain from rubbing, which doesn't seem to be possible since the cable is slack, or I need to bring the chain more to the right, by replacing this mysterious missing spacer."
bikewrench,3914mu,mellett68,2,Mon Jun 8 15:50:43 2015 UTC,"You'll have limit screws on your derailleur for this, it may have been coincidentally held in the right spot by the old cable."
bikewrench,3914mu,snowboardracer,2,Mon Jun 8 16:59:52 2015 UTC,"In a perfect world, you wouldn't need to adjust your limit screws for a cable swap.  It's possible you'll need to adjust them with a cassette swap, particularly, if you went 10 to 11 speed (or vice versa), but even sometimes with the same number of cogs.  We'll just start from the top.  In order to know how many, if any, cassette spacers (or ""freehub spacers"") you need, we'll need to know what the new cassette is and what kind of freehub you have.  For those playing along at home, here's a nice chart.  It would also help to know the make and model of your old cassette.    It's unlikely that you missed a spacer because your lockring wouldn't seat properly.  Too many spacers and it shouldn't thread down enough (if at all).  Not enough spacers and you'll probably have a tiny gap.  If you think you've got a spacer issue after looking at the chart, fix that first.  Have you ever replaced a cassette before?  Is it possible you didn't torque the lockring enough?  How did you tighten it?  What kind of resistance did you experience?   You've got two issues here -- neither of your derailleurs are working correctly.  Let's go one at a time.    I wrench by adjusting the RD before the FD.  What do you mean by the RD is having trouble shifting ""all the way up?""  Do you mean it's tough to get into the high (small cog) or low (BIG cog) gear?  Unhook your RD cable and start here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQncKmddahk  If that doesn't work, let us know.  If the RD starts working well, move to the FD.  Do this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfBiXgf8JxI .  If that doesn't work, let us know."
bikewrench,3914mu,nhluhr,0,Mon Jun 8 20:09:20 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the reply. I looked up the manual for my wheel (mavic kysrium) and it specifies a single spacer for my cassette (shimano 10sp). (Contrary to that chart, unless I'm reading it wrong.) FYI I didn't replace the cassette, just removed it for cleaning. However my derailleurs are all out of whack--my front shifter broke while I was out on a ride and I ended up jerry rigging the derailleur and cable to put me on to the big ring. I probably messed something up.   Thanks for the videos--I'll take another stab at adjusting the derailleurs tonight or tomorrow."
bikewrench,391imd,aeroxan,5,Mon Jun 8 15:55:56 2015 UTC,I'd be more worried about my junk than catastrophic saddle failure. Take the bolt out and grind or hacksaw off the protruding length. Reinstall.
bikewrench,391imd,Hagenaar,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:18:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I'll either cut it or get a shorter bolt.
bikewrench,391imd,pthu,3,Mon Jun 8 16:28:47 2015 UTC,"Buying a shorter bolt is easier. Go to a hardware store like Ace or True Value and ask an employee. Steel hex metric bolts around M8-M10 in short lengths will likely be under a dollar each.  Source: went to replace a rusty headset preload bolt last year, ended up springing for the $2 stainless one.  Edit: /u/couchdive makes an important point about bolt grades. In addition to matching size, make sure the new bolt is of the correct grade as well. (Google search ""bolt grades"" to find out more)"
bikewrench,391imd,couchdive,3,Mon Jun 8 17:37:22 2015 UTC,"Whaoh, Hold on a minute. Many bolts are overly hardened and brittle, if this bolt is under a different type of stress than designed it will break....You don't want to grab random bolts at a hardware store.  P.S. this is my tailbone speaking to you right now, my ass was laid up in bed for 4 days because of going to a hardware store to replace a bolt that should have been softer steel."
bikewrench,391imd,pthu,2,Mon Jun 8 19:21:41 2015 UTC,"You're right; I should have emphasized that more. Bolts come in different grades, normally marked on the bolt itself. Since /u/aeroxan wanted a shorter bolt, it seemed reasonable to assume when I posted that this would involve bringing the bolt to the store and getting a match both for size and grade."

bikewrench,391imd,Hagenaar,2,Mon Jun 8 22:03:12 2015 UTC,"rusty headset preload bolt   That's a good place for a stainless bolt. Mine is often a small swimming pool filled with sweat.   I'd advise against this for any of the stem bolts, though. Too hard to know if the stainless bolts match the originals for strength."
bikewrench,391imd,Vojta7,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:33:21 2015 UTC,There's no way you could strip a stainless steel bolt with the torque used on the stem bolts. AFAIK some stems even use aluminium bolts...
bikewrench,391imd,Hagenaar,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:44:57 2015 UTC,The ability of a bolt to hold its thread and its overall strength are two very different things.
bikewrench,391imd,Vojta7,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:10:03 2015 UTC,"IMO the probability of a stem bolt snapping is even lower than that of striping the thread, as long as you aren't using a huge torque trying to loosen a seized one. If you have a 4-bolt handlebar clamp, 5-6 Nm is enough to all of the bolts, isn't it?  I just tried to snap two smaller (M4?) bolts and ended up only striping the threads and being unable to get them out of the nuts and even that required quite a lot of force, way more than I'd be comfortable using on a stem bolt.  And on aluminium stems, aren't the threads in the stem Al (weaker than steel) as well?"
bikewrench,391imd,Hagenaar,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:59:52 2015 UTC,A bolt made from very hard steel could easily strip out any aluminum stem. So could a softer one. But it's the shear strength and resistance to cracking which matters when a bike is in motion. Steel bolts come in many varied hardnesses and strength ratings. Not all are suitable for a stem.
bikewrench,391imd,levelsaddle,2,Tue Jun 9 04:42:05 2015 UTC,and ask an employee   uhh metrik? is that like inches?
bikewrench,3915u8,vtmusicwork,2,Mon Jun 8 14:23:11 2015 UTC,"If drilling it out doesn't work, try a tiny easy-out.  If that doesn't work, just keep it there, put the plastic barrel adjuster back on there and route the cable right back through it. The cable tension and housing will hold the adjuster in place."
bikewrench,3915u8,qsceszxdwa,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:43:27 2015 UTC,Thanks. The easy-out didn't work. Though I also couldn't get it aligned well because of tool size.   Will it stay in place even when the cable tension is at its lowest?
bikewrench,3915u8,Hagenaar,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:21:30 2015 UTC,"If that doesn't work, just keep it there, put the plastic barrel adjuster back on there and route the cable right back through it.    You'd want something to hold it in line with the guide, otherwise it will flop all over the place, and the inner cable will quickly get bent and wreck the shifting.  If the EasyOut won't extract the barrel, I'd drill the thing out just large enough to slide in a new barrel adjuster. It wouldn't be threaded there anymore, so an inline adjuster would be needed farther up the cable."
bikewrench,3915u8,audiocycle,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:28:46 2015 UTC,"From what I can see, you haven't drilled big enough to clear with a tap yet. Drill size for tapping M5 is 4.2mm (between 5/32 and 11/64, or yet #18 or #19) If you are lucky, the bit might grip on the remnants of the barrel adjuster and screw it out through the bottom.  Worst case scenario you can pierce with a bit between 13/64 and 1/4 (ideally less than 1/4) and just slide in a new barrel adjuster that will act as a fixed cable stop."
bikewrench,3915u8,audiocycle,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:53:07 2015 UTC,"You're correct. The problem I was having was not finding drill bits long enough to get good alignment with the existing hole because of how close it is to the frame. I found a 1/8"" bit 12"" long at HD, but operating the tap through that was too difficult. I did look for a 5/32"" bit long enough, but the only one I could find was meant for masonry - it worked slower, probably walked a little more, but made the hole large enough.  I was able to salvage a few threads, but not enough to maintain the adjuster functionality. I had to use an adjustable wrench on the end of the tap to run it through the hole because of the minimal clearance to the frame. I've threaded the adjuster into the frame, and will be adding an inline adjuster. I guess another option is filling the hole with JBweld and trying again with a different 5/32"" bit, but I'm not sure if that'll be worth the effort.  What kind of tools are used when clearance is an issue? I should have  probably purchased the correct extended length 5/32"" bit from McMaster."
bikewrench,38zjdg,elchupakabros,3,Mon Jun 8 03:53:28 2015 UTC,"I am confused by your choice of wording. ""Second to none"" means ""nothing is better"", but the rest of the comment makes it seem like you mean that the braking is bad. So if you are indeed unsatisfied with your brakes, you can try new cables and housing and you'll get a certain amount of improvement, more noticeably if you use compressionless housing like Jagwire Road Pro or Yokozuna Reaction, but that stuff can be expensive  and it's hard to find with just the brake cables and housing alone (they usually come in complete brake/shift sets). New pads will make a pretty noticeable difference too, but again, most noticeably if you're going for a set of pretty nice pads like the Kool Stop Salmon pads or some of the offerings from Swiss Stop. A pair of brake cartridge pads (with replaceable shoes) like these can run $25-$40/pair, so the price can get up there. In the end though, replacing both the pads and housing with nice stuff like this can end up costing about as much as a new set of 105 brake calipers.  There are other variables, too, like how effective your levers are (a lot of old road levers aren't very stiff and don't pull as much cable as some of the newer options), the material of your rims (steel rims don't brake as well as alloy rims, some cheap alloy rims don't have machined brake surfaces), whether the bike needs long-reach brakes (not typically as effective as short-reach brakes due to added flex)."

bikewrench,38zjdg,kinboyatuwo,2,Mon Jun 8 05:17:33 2015 UTC,"Yep, pair of swiss stop pad sets cost just like new 105 callipers.

bikewrench,38z80a,goody16,6,Mon Jun 8 02:16:27 2015 UTC,Sounds like a bent hanger to me.
bikewrench,38z80a,FalseBuddha,3,Mon Jun 8 03:11:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed, bent hanger will cause the derailleur to shift better in one direction only. Until it's fixed, tune the derailleur to shift properly into high gears; the low gears can be shifted with a little extra nudge."
bikewrench,38z80a,miniclubbin,3,Mon Jun 8 03:17:40 2015 UTC,"The derailleur should be adjusted to keep it out of the spokes, to avoid more severe damage, first and foremost. Then it can be adjusted to shift as nicely as possible until the hanger can be straightened, but in my mind that's really a secondary concern."
bikewrench,38z80a,FalseBuddha,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:42:31 2015 UTC,Thanks to you both - I was hoping that wasn't it but I think it may be. What should I do? Return it (since it's new) or is it fixable?
bikewrench,38z80a,bikewazowski,3,Mon Jun 8 03:39:57 2015 UTC,The hanger is a separate part from the derailleur. They are $15-$20 usually. They are made to match your frame. Sometimes they can be straightened (bent back) but this can also weaken them to the point of being unsafe to use. I'd recommend just buying a new one and tossing the old one in the toolbox for an emergency backup.

Assuming the bottom bracket is installed by the bike shop that sells the bike, would it be their responsibility to do it?  With a bottom bracket like this though, only the drive side has a part that touches the face of the BB shell. On the 3rd picture (with the flash), it kinda seems like the drive side was faced. On the first two pictures, we see the non-drive side only. That side of the BB (the plastic part) does not touch the face of the shell, so it wouldn't matter. Am I right?"
bikewrench,38ydwi,LeroyGecko,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:52:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I may be old-school and overly cautious, but I always like to make sure both sides of the bottom bracket are properly faced parallel to each other because either side being out of whack can potentially affect adjustment of the other side.  To be honest, it's probably more a thing that was important in the past when bottom brackets cost big bucks, and they weren't $20 pieces that get replaced on regular intervals.  The shop should theoretically deal with things like this, but the manufacturer typically installs them at the factory in bulk."

Once you place your order, you will be contacted by a representative from the company who sorts out all your options.  What model are you looking at? If I could make a recommendation, I'd say it's better to pick one of their lightweight models over their aero framesets, primarily because you know they're not doing wind tunnel testing, and weight claims are easy to verify. I got an ""aero"" frame, and since swapping it out for a cervelo R5 (a lightweight frame with some aero characteristics), I kind of doubt the 098 was particularly aero.

bikewrench,38ymxe,FalseBuddha,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:25:14 2015 UTC,"It's not uncommon. There is very little load on the drivetrain in the stand, so it's relatively easy for the derailleurs to move the chain.  I worked in a shop for a while that sold some internally routed frames that, from the factory, had their cables wrapped around each other inside the downtube. They would work perfectly in the stand; you wouldn't be able to tell until the test ride after assembly."

bikewrench,38yff1,B1CYCl3R3P41RM4N,2,Mon Jun 8 01:12:13 2015 UTC,"""Worth"" is a subjective term.  I run PC870 on my 1X8 and I've noticed the chains do indeed last me longer. On my 10sp however, I run the cheapest I can because they are so prohibitively expensive.   If you think the one I linked is expensive, you should check out a whipperman:  http://www.modernbike.com/product-2126201753?gclid=Cj0KEQjw18-rBRDogrTg4Lusuu0BEiQACs8YQkjHF1GbI2qDPTdw1anpGemVURa4kM0LZLhJPMI4lo4aAjdK8P8HAQ  And keep in mind, that's on close out"

bikewrench,38zkmy,DivineTesticles,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:04:27 2015 UTC,"1) Make sure to observe all steps of cold-setting the rear triangle, such as realigning the rear triangle and the dropouts. Failure to realign the dropouts can lead to axle failures.   2) The new cassette and chain will (very probably) play well with the chainrings on your old crankset. However, if you're planning on adding indexed shifters, it's likely that neither of your derailleurs will work. If you're sticking to friction, it will be fine."
bikewrench,38zkmy,Catonanapkin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:50:59 2015 UTC,All chain rings are not cross compatible however there should be no issues going from 6 to 8 speed
bikewrench,38zkmy,B1CYCl3R3P41RM4N,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:29:17 2015 UTC,The main issue you might encounter is that the rear derailleur might not be cooperative with the new setup.  But anything less than 8-speed people typically just use 8-speed chain for now.  So 6 and 8 speed use the same chain.  That shouldn't be a problem.
bikewrench,38zkmy,SavingHawaii,0,Mon Jun 8 05:43:16 2015 UTC,The bike is friction shift so unless he's putting some kind of wide range cassette on it shouldn't be an issue

If you go non-metallic to metallic your brakes won't generate as much friction as they could. If you go metallic to non-metallic the material left on the rotor will chew your new organic pads up fast

bikewrench,38yrgh,Audiophiliac,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:58:54 2015 UTC,"By ""road bike"" do you mean ""bike with drop bars?"" Because, stick some road tires on there and if everything else works you could call it a day and have a nice enough bike. Start talking drop bars though and it gets more interesting. A pair of digital calipers would help to measure the exact clamp diameter of the stem, though I'd expect 25.4mm. 25.4mm drop bars pose their own limitations, but are doable for varying budgets. The shifting will be the hardest part. Easiest and possibly ""cheapest"" if not cheap is get a set of road brake levers, aero or not, and some bar end shifters and run it all friction. Trying to keep the indexed while changing to road stuff will be more fuss than I'd want to do, personally. And, I don't just mean on that bike, but more in general. And then you'd still have to deal with the long top tube since it was meant for upright riding... It's not that you can't do it, I've done stupider projects, it's just that it won't be easy or really even terribly cheap if that's what you were thinking. Better would be to clean it up enough to sell and put the money towards your real road bike, really."
bikewrench,38yaf9,savisannoying,2,Sun Jun 7 21:42:23 2015 UTC,"Are you using metal tire levers?  I've found them to be very much more likely to put a hole in a tube.  You ought to patch your tubes.  Vulcanizing patches are really cheap and it is way less wasteful.  As you're mounting the second side of the tire make sure the tube is not under the bead of the tire with every move.  Some people claim to be able to mount any tire with no tools.  I'm not sure it's true, but using the right technique I've managed some very tight tires.

It would probably be cheaper."
bikewrench,38wp3l,audiocycle,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:08:54 2015 UTC,"I've ridden both Ultegra and Chorus and prefer the Chorus more. From my experience the Chorus setup felt snappier and you get the added benefits of the thumb shifter. Additionally I prefer the look of Campy over Shimano and where I live (austin, tx) parts aren't difficult to find. Lastly, I'd like you to show me where I can find another Ti Bianchi frame in 59/60 that's under $2000 and I can assure you they're not easy to find. I searched hi and low for this particular bike and got a sweet deal on it so I figured swapping out the groupset wouldn't be that big of a challenge. It came with a King Ti headset and a bunch of nice spare parts so it was absolutely worth it. I plan on taking these off and putting them on my daily commuter so I have 2 nice bikes. Then the S9 would be more of a evenings/weekend machine. I already have a set of Thomson drop bars, stem, and seatpost ordered. As well as a set of Campy Zonda wheels."

Also, I'm not a fan of those thumb shifters for cable release, I'm happy Shimano took the route they chose. If you like em, ride em!  I'll give you that, you seem to have put a lot of thought into this. I don't doubt finding a titanium Bianchi in your size is hard to find but I'm not one to shop my frames by manufacturer either. Have you thought about going custom? I know some of the custom frame builders in the states work with titanium. Otherwise a couple brands offer Ti framesets, depending on the geometry you want.  For your question about the BB, you can measure the bottom bracket shell on your bike. It's probably a 70mm and thus has Italian threading. If 68mm, it's the more standard British threads. Both are still in use but the latter is far more common."

Using a ruler is not a super reliable way to measure tube diameters. You should be using calipers or a stepped sizing post. Call your LBS see if they have a 22.2 post you could test fit.

bikewrench,38vush,B1CYCl3R3P41RM4N,0,Tue Jun 9 05:04:54 2015 UTC,"First check to see if the tube is ovalized. Measure the tube diameter in as many places as you can to see if that is in fact the case. If so, get a 7/8"" post lube it up real good and tell the bike to bite the pillow and just hammer it in. A steel frame should be able to take the abuse. If you can't even get a 7/8"" post started in the seat tube though, you can try gently prying at the opening with a long flathead screwdriver. Stick it in the slot and turn it with your wrist to see if you can get it to open up enough to take the post.   It's entirely possible that this bike has some really strange seat tube diameter too. Ultimately you need to decide if the bike is worth the effort. Good luck"

Spinning backward is also not a good indication of a problem; if the freehub is sticky or really worn it can hang momentarily and cause the RD to detension the chain.  Everything (shifting ramps/pins) is designed to be directional.   Rewatched video its not blatantly the freehub   RD pulleys should be parallel with cogs.  More than 1-2 degrees off will do all sorts of weird things.  Seen it on a $100 bike and a $6000 DA-Di2 bike.  Always be careful with that RD!

Maybe it's a ""track bike feature"" and they just rotated that bridge to make it ""not drilled for brakes."" Who the hell knows.   I can't really think of a good solution either. A good welder might be able to fabricate some kind of reverse drop-bolt, as described by Sheldon. A second brake bridge (scavenged from a junk frame or ordered from nova) attached to a threaded stud secured above the existing bridge with a nut ought to work, but would likely require long reach caliper.

I therefore counted the big ring the same way as you counted the middle ring and it looks like a 55t ring, or thereabouts. That's massive. Is this a recumbent?  Anyway, ""can be had cheaply"" still applies.  As for the SRAM chain, the chain SRAM use dates back to the Sedis chain, which became known as Sachs-Sedis. It has always been a spectacularly good chain for the money, as opposed to Shimano chains which are surprisingly poor for the (lots of) money.  The SRAM 951-type chain is reliable and well-made, and Shimano's claim that only their chains work with the fast-shifting ramps on their rings/cogs is just not true.

bikewrench,38tn1k,WuTangDan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:51:02 2015 UTC,no it's five  edit:  I put up a picture of the big ring and cassette as well
bikewrench,38tn1k,mellett68,2,Mon Jun 8 00:57:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, get yourself down to your bike shop and buy new:  Rings Chain Cassette  Also, buy chain lube and inspect the jockey wheels on the derailleur to make sure they are not also excessively worn. If so, it is possible to replace them without buying new a derailleur.  To check chain wear, you can use a special tool, or a ruler, or just learn to do it ""by eye"" by the method of trying to pull it off the big ring. The methods are summarised here: http://www.londoncyclist.co.uk/when-should-you-replace-your-bike-chain/  (I have ridden seriously for decades and I do it ""by eye"").

If that's the case, you may have to flip the bike over, unbolt the front brake & put something up the steerer & hammer in it. Yes, you may do damage so this should be last resort.

I am assuming that you have knocked the bit holding the stem off, and it is still seized.  Use penetrating oil (not wd40) diesel works. let it sit for a day or so. Take the wheel off, and clamp the crown of the forks to a large immovable object using g-clamps and blocks of wood to prevent damaging your lovely paint.  You can now twist the stem out much harder, and you have no danger of damaging your wheel or bending your forks this way."

bikewrench,38pah7,dude_the_dirt_farmer,2,Fri Jun 5 18:30:51 2015 UTC,I am assuming you are talking about the C35-TU wheels which actually have a carbon brake track?  You can use a fresh/clean GRAY Scotchbrite pad (their ultra-fine) along with the acetone and that'll scrub it off quickly.  Try to avoid scrubbing below the actual brake track and don't use excess pressure as that'll remove more material than necessary (including some of the carbon's matrix).

Firstly, loosen up the bolt(s) on the side of the stem, and tighten the top cap down a bit, retighten the stem bolts. It should move freely, but if you grab the front end right under the arch of the fork and at the stem, there shouldn't be any wobble.  Secondly, tug on your brake caliper with your hand a bit. See if it feels loose. There should only be one direction of movement in the whole caliper, and that's in the pads clenching the rim.

It's nice to spend a little extra money and get compressionless brake housing if you're running discs, but it's really not necessary.  I think silky smoothness is more a function of the age of your cables/housing than the initial quality.  If you want something nicer, however, check out Nokon cables.  Major hassle to install, but they look cool and perform great."

Though your Trek probably has a double chainrings at 39/52ish and most single speed cranksets are somewhere in the middle of that, so you will most likely be changing the gearing on your Jamis.  Unless the Trek has a newer bottom bracket, it might not be sealed either.  If I were you, I'd just leave what you have and sell the Trek on CL."
bikewrench,38p5od,lperohgf0348y80y,2,Fri Jun 5 21:01:42 2015 UTC,"You'd be better off cleaning up the trek and tuning it up and selling it as a whole bike to someone and then buy new parts with that money for your Jamis. A sealed shimano BB is only 20-30$ and should last a while. You can get a decent sugino single speed crank for a 100 or less. RX100 stuff wasn't bad but I don't think replacing a new microshift FD that is working is going to get you anything performance-wise, so I wouldn't bother. Depending on your local resale market you should be able to get 200$ for a working vintage road bike and you can just buy some nice new parts for your two bikes with that money."
bikewrench,38mr38,YellowDickiesCup,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:35:54 2015 UTC,"So I looked at the bike again to try and make sure its rims are 27.25, and found some text on the tires I hadnt seen before 27 and 1/8 on the tire(27.125). But the rims do say 27x1.1/4(17x630) by Weinmann. The brake fixing bolt to middle of rim length was 42-45mm. I took a few pictures but imgur is being busy right now."
bikewrench,38mr38,DonOblivious,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:37:13 2015 UTC,It's not as simple as slapping on a new brakeset.  You've probably got nutted brakes so you'll either need to get out the drill and convert your bike bike to recessed brakes or buy a modern nutted brake (Tektro makes a bunch).  Converting to 700c down the road complicates things so you may as well do it at the same time so you can get the right front brake the first time.
bikewrench,38mr38,DonOblivious,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:18:24 2015 UTC,The front hub race has a 3mm spot of surface rust on the race. I wanted to get rid of it as soon as I could. It will probably be fine though for quite a long time.    The brakes are recessed already.    So from 27x1.25 to 700c is 2 different sets of brakes?
bikewrench,38mr38,lemondatax,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:47:20 2015 UTC,"So from 27x1.25 to 700c is 2 different sets of brakes?   Well, it sounded like you wanted to put on a pair of new brakes and then in the future convert to 700c.  If you do that you'd either need to make sure your new brakes have enough reach, and enough adjustment, to fit both a 27"" and 700c wheel or you'd end up buying twice.  Plus you're looking at either drilling for recessed or buying nutted brakes with the right reach and... it just makes more sense to do everything at once, rather than piecemeal, if you can afford it (trust me, I know that particular pain)."
bikewrench,38nji2,Super_Dork_42,3,Fri Jun 5 10:54:34 2015 UTC,Why do you need to see the gear? I am feeling the right gear with my muscles.
bikewrench,38nji2,ssianky,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:54:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess it's more a matter of preference, but I prefer to know with only a slight downward glance instead of trying to decipher some of these myself."
bikewrench,38nji2,zedmartinez,2,Fri Jun 5 13:56:05 2015 UTC,"I was in that spot once, now I'm back around to less so. The gauge indicator on my trigger shift broke about a year ago, and honestly I can't be bothered to fix it. And my new primary bike uses friction bar ends. I rarely know what gear I'm in, exactly, and I find I don't mind.  After you've swapped a cassette or two you learn it's kinda useless to know which gear it is so much as where in the stack you are (I'm almost on the biggest gear! or I'm on the smallest gear, no more go-power!), and friction shifters are great for that. You can also skim over gears faster with friction, and friction shifters aren't picky as to how many speeds you try and run and which derailleurs you use, which makes them great for rebuilds. Not saying there's not a time and place and such for indexed, just that friction has a lot more merit than most people realize since it got successfully branded as the older, worser idea back when indexed was being pushed."
bikewrench,38nji2,zedmartinez,2,Fri Jun 5 14:07:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I used to use a non indexed bike and hated it, even without knowing there were alternatives. With my ADHD I'd constantly be forgetting what gear I was in or where in the stack I was in and one of the shifters always seems to be going the opposite direction of intuition."
bikewrench,38nji2,zedmartinez,2,Fri Jun 5 14:11:26 2015 UTC,"So too though do trigger and grip shifters, because of how the chainrings go to large on the outside, and the cogs the reverse. But, your preference is yours. Just saying there's always some value in friction shifters, there are things they do or enable that indexing doesn't. Maybe not worth it to you and that's fair enough, but hard to dismiss them offhand in totality, I guess."
bikewrench,38nji2,zedmartinez,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:16:33 2015 UTC,"What do they do better? I guess I never thought about it. I mean to me, the definition between the gears and ease of just going click and hearing and feeling that feedback is better and easier than moving the lever an arbitrary amount and looking down and hoping it's the right amount to shift."
bikewrench,38nji2,GoonCommaThe,3,Fri Jun 5 20:24:18 2015 UTC,"well, one, the idea of ""the right amount to shift"" is sort of subjective, and how much one gear even means is dependent on your cassette spacing. With indexed shifting, I have to think in terms of clicks. ""I need to click three times to feel in the right gear."" With friction, I just push until the gearing feels right, then stop. Rarely anymore do I mis-shift, and when I do, it's a half second gesture to fix.  Things friction does better (IMO): 1. Skipping gears. Friction shifts continuously, not in steps, so, skipping up three or four gears at a stop is a seamless process, not a series of clicks. Same when I get started. At this point, I don't even care which gear I'm in on the back, pushing the lever to the right place has just become muscle memory for most of my daily commute.   Trim. Indexed shifting is bullocks at trimming. It just can't, usually. So, chain rub on the front derailleur is just something you have to live with in some combinations (not even necessarily cross chaining, either). With friction, you can just tap the shifter and nudge the FD until the chain isn't rubbing anymore. Less fidgety. Cable stretched a little? Have to adjust indexed shifting. Someone bumped your rear derailleur while your bike was parked? Might have to adjust the shifting. Everything about indexed shifting has to be within pretty tight tolerances to work, or at least to work properly and without making noise. Friction only cares that you have the minimum and maximum travel for each derailleur set. The steps inbetween don't matter, it'll hit them all. More universal. This one is especially nice when rebuilding or upgrading bikes. Can't find a 6 speed derailleur, but have 6 speed indexed? Now you're shopping online to find out if the 7 speed will work (admittedly, it probably will). Now though even 8 is becoming rarer, as 10 and 11 take over. Broke a shifter (and, most indexed shifters have more to break than a metal friction shifter does)? Now it's a hunt to find either the same one, or a similar one. Friction doesn't care about any of that, just the total range. I'm using an old Suntour derailleur meant for a 6 speed cassette with an 8 speed megarange just fine. Well, it has problems sometimes getting into the mega range (I have to shift like I mean it), but, when I get around to upgrading literally any MTB rear derailleur I can find in the discount bin will do the job. Since I'm relatively lazy, and cheap, I like that about friction. It also means I don't necessarily have to rely on special order parts to keep a bike going. I can more often use what I can find, or what's on hand. Less of a deal on newer bikes, but rebuilding old ones... Like, if you kill the wheels on that old Schwinn and decide to buy new ones, it can be hard to find ones that take a 5 speed freewheel still. Upgrading to 700c freehub is easy enough, but now you're talking needing a 7 speed cassette probably, and more likely an 8. With indexed, you're now replacing the derailleur and shifters both. With friction, maybe the derailleur. Maybe. Maybe it'll actually work. I like that."
bikewrench,38nji2,GoonCommaThe,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:55:51 2015 UTC,"""the right amount to shift"" is sort of subjective   What I mean is that sometimes I would move the lever but it wouldn't be enough to shift to the next gear.  I thought indexing was basically just a labeling method and the clicking and definite sort of here you are thing was a later development. TIL."
bikewrench,38nji2,onseali,2,Fri Jun 5 21:07:07 2015 UTC,"While true there are ""indexed"" friction thumbies that show numbers approximating where gears are, the idea of ""indexed shifting"" most typically refers to systems with detents that correlate to discrete shifts. It was marketed as easier shifting, but requires components that utilize a constant cable travel, and now common compressionless housing to keep that constant."
bikewrench,38nji2,GoonCommaThe,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:27:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Thanks. I guess the thing I hated most was throwing the lever either all the way into high gear or all the way into low gear and never trying to get the middle gear on the front because it was such a crapshoot whether it would even change when I put the lever in the middle. The back had more gears (not as many as I'd like but more than the front gears) and I didn't have to worry so much, but then with totally unmarked shifting I'd forget which one was front and which was back gears. I think having the confidence to be able to know for sure 'this action will change to this gear when you need it to' is the thing I like best about indexed shifters. In a non cycling town, every bit of time I can watch the road instead of my bike is a moment where I'm keeping myself safer."

(or clamp band/braze on screw)  If this has happened repeatedly, I'd imagine you've probably thought of this and tightened the shit out of it by now.  2 - A missing cable housing ferrule somewhere in the drive train, or ferrules not yet fully compressed onto the housings (if this has been happening more than like a week the latter is unlikely).  I have seen it where a missing housing ferrule has caused the shifter to basically ""eat"" the cable housing by slowly stripping the rubber away and causing the metal fibers in the housing to work their way into or around the point where the shift housing enters the STI lever.  If you have no internal housing (I don't think that Kona does) you should be able to just peel back the hood and check it there, or look at any place the housing stops.  3 - When installed, the cable housings were measured, cables inserted, then taped down hard enough with electrical tape or bar tape that they pulled out of the shifter, under the bars.  They are then slowly working their way back to where they'd ultimately rest. (you might notice oddities on the tape job on the left side if that's the case)."

With 105 5700 series, changing gear on a new set if cables will be feather light - especially on the rear. If it isn't, then you need to change them.  Disconnect the cable from the derailleur, then slide the inner cable back and forth on the different sections of outer. If any stick then that section of outer cable needs changing too. I tend to find that the loop from my chain-stay to the rear derailleur gets changed every 2-3 inner cables.  Do not under-estimate the importance of cables.

bikewrench,38hjrt,3chicken,13,Thu Jun 4 06:43:42 2015 UTC,"Tires are quite frequently rock hard and beyond.  With road bike tires this is a major problem.  60psi feels about the same by the finger test as 100psi but it's ridiculously underinflated.  With hybrid tires they often feel rock hard at even lower pressures due to the rubber, carcass, and particularly the flat protection in the tire making them firmer.  Trust your gauge, not your fingers.  There are some aging bike wrenches out there who can pretty accurately tell pressure with their hand but that's a useless skill they happened upon after decades of squeezing tires.  Your fingers are not a tire pressure gauge without a lifetime of training."
bikewrench,38hjrt,SavingHawaii,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:51:15 2015 UTC,"60psi only feels like 100psi if you have virtually no grip strength or ability to judge resistance. I can (within about 5 psi) tell you how much air pressure is in any given tire based on feel alone. I'm also not some ancient bike mechanic that has been doing this for decades. I still haven't actually crested 10years of shop experience, but I can still confidently tell you how much air is in your tire"
bikewrench,38hjrt,byke4130,5,Fri Jun 5 04:17:37 2015 UTC,"A 1.5"" tire (even a Schwalbe) should not be rock hard at 35 PSI. Get a second gauge to double check your pump. You may, or may not be able to mechanically calibrate the gauge, but you can figure out what it reads at the target pressure from a proper gauge as a reference."
bikewrench,38hjrt,Catonanapkin,2,Thu Jun 4 09:25:05 2015 UTC,The gauge definitely sounds faulty because it should not be dropping back to 0 when it's still attached to the valve.

Tbh, the pump you're using is kind of a p.o.s. anyway, but it should still give you a somewhat accurate assessment of what the air pressure of your tires are"

bikewrench,38exja,55555thatisfivefives,3,Wed Jun 3 20:53:21 2015 UTC,"This is something that someone reasonably knowledgeable could help you out with.  Installing bottom brackets and swapping stems is pretty straight forward.  Replacing bars is easy but a little time consuming, because you have to remove grips, brake levers, shift levers, and accessories (light mounts, etc).  There's a risk that you might need to run new cables and housing if your stem swap extends your stack or reach significantly.  You're also going to need to adjust your headset after you swap that stem, so you get to learn how to do that as well."
bikewrench,38exja,55555thatisfivefives,2,Wed Jun 3 19:41:47 2015 UTC,"So you think this is a good project to tackle at the co-op's ""open shop"" night? I was worried it would be too much to ask for free help with given my lack of knowledge."

If this were me doing this in my shop, where I know the layout of all my tools and I know I have everything I'm going to need, not going to have to wait on parts or ask for help or watch anyone demonstrate, I would give myself 60-90 minutes to do this, taking my time and not rushing.  (oh shit, i just forgot that you might also need either a new chain or cut your existing chain shorter, depending on what rings you're switching to).  So maybe just go in with the goal of swapping cranks or stem, and not both tonight.  See how it goes, and if you get a good feeling from it, go back another night to finish the rest of what you want to do. Depending on how worn your chain is, you might want to throw a new chain on there with new chainrings."
bikewrench,38exja,55555thatisfivefives,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:52:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip.  But I agree I'll probably go in with the goal of just replacing the crank set and BB since my current crank set is bent...  I am going from a 3x to a 2x and the smallest COG on the new crank set is only 2 teeth smaller than my current set up so I figured I would be ok there.  The chain is only one year old.    Just to confirm I can just limit my current derailleur to work with the new 2x correct?  I did a lot of research before so I hope I have everything I need.  What do you think?

bikewrench,38exja,howmanydads,2,Wed Jun 3 20:17:51 2015 UTC,"That's technically correct.  But now you're moving out of ""let's have a bike that's trail worthy"" territory and into ""just make it work"" territory.  Also, you're going to want to face your BB shell for that bottom bracket. Those specs show your bike coming with a Tourney FD.  That's technically a 7-spd derailleur, and you're using it with an 8-spd drivetrain, and it's working.  Now you're going to put 9/10-spd cranks on there.  You can probably get things working, but at this point it's no guarantees.  Consider a new FD and new front shifter."

Can't believe specialized would put that on this bike as their stock FD lol.  I guess my thing is I didn't want to have two different styles of shifter on the bike but I guess that's what I get for trying to ""upgrade"" an entry level bike.  I apologize for my lack of knowledge but definitely some good insight!

bikewrench,38exja,safepants2,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:31:36 2015 UTC,"I mean it's not crappy of Specialized to do that.  All bike manufacturers do what they can to get a bike to a certain price point.  It works.  It's not XTR, but it's not $6k, either. At this point it's just a matter of how nice do you want things to be?    Something like a Deore M610 would be decent.  You can buy just the left shifter and it's compatible with doubles and triples (has a little mode selector on the bottom to switch from 2 to 3 rings).  That's just one option.  Honestly at this point go to the co-op, pull your pedals, pull your cranks, pull your BB, clean your BB threads, face your BB shell, prep the threads of your new BB, install it, torque it, install your cranks and torque them, then grease the threads of your new pedals and install and torque them, then work on getting your FD and shifter to play nice with your new cranks.  If it works, great, if not, then think about a new front shifter and FD.  Honestly I'd just ride the hell out of the bike until you're sure you know what you don't like about it and change things at that point."

If it's bent too much, it can't be aligned and will have to be replaced (typically about $25 USD).  Don't ride it until then, or at least don't ride it in your lowest 2-3 gears.

bikewrench,38cp91,Nomnom_downvotes,5,Wed Jun 3 10:56:39 2015 UTC,"Guessing you'll be running Shimano again, so what you'll want is a Shadow+ derailleur. These have a clutch that keep the chain tighter, thus less likely to drop the chain. SRAM calls this a Type2 derailleur. If you want t run a Shadow+ they don't make those for 9s drivetrains. So you'll need to go the 10s way, which also means getting a new shifter lever. No, you can't just use the 10s derailleur for 9s - they changed the cable pull ratios between 9s and 10s. I'd recommend you get the Zee derailleur and shifter. Get the longest one, that'll run and 11-36 cassette, as this gives you a nice wide range. The 11-28 version is really only for downhill. The Zee is a budget DH group, so designet to run 1x10 and to take a bit more of a beating. I converted my 3x10 to 1x10 with the Zee. I did also get a narrowwide chainring. With a Shadow+ derailleur it's not hugely required for the types of terrain we have here in Denmark, but greatly advised."

You'd need the derailleur ofcource - make sure it's the 11-36 one. shifter too A 10 speed chain and a 10 speed chain <- As far as these goes, no need to buy the most expensive stuff out there. Get Deore if you can, I think that's pretty decent for the money. No need to go above SLX at least. As far as narrowwide chainrings go, basically just get the cheapest with the correct BCD. I have a SRAM X1 since I got it dirt cheap of our equivalent to craigslist. I think E-thirteen and RaceFace are quite popular in the States.

bikewrench,38dy9q,dialectric,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:08:39 2015 UTC,"It's defined as ""Hollowtech II"" or more generically as ""external bottom bracket"".

The narrower tire will be slower and less comfortable.  There's been a big move to the 25c tire even by the pros.  If it were me, I'd stick with 25c. I also don't think I'd put a narrower tire on the rear than on the front but I don't know if there's any scientific basis for that, just in my head that doesn't sound right."
bikewrench,38dli6,BukketsofNothing,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:57:09 2015 UTC,"You can ignore sheldon's info.  People successfully put 23c tires onto rims with 20mm internal width.  However, I'd strongly recommend moving your front 25 to the rear and replacing the front with something, whether it be a 23 or a new 25.  It's well demonstrated that rolling resistance improves with wider tires and putting the 23 on your more loaded wheel won't make you any faster.  Likewise, the front is more important for aerodynamics so if you REALLY want a 23 put one there where the load is light and it won't make as much difference in rolling resistance."

It can be annoying to change a flat, but you get much better heel clearance and your load won't bounce around when you hit a bump. The road version mounts to caliper brakes with no rack braze ons.

It's horses for courses though: if you've got a nice flat commute over a short-to-medium distance but it's full of last night's broken bottles, Marathons are your friends.

Yes, I got a puncture every 2 weeks but who cares; I could pop the tire off, pick the glass out, swap the tube, and reseat the tire in under 2 minutes.

Make sure the area is really really clean before patching, and that the edges of the patch are smudged right onto the tube itself.  Also apply lots of pressure to the patch and give it enough time to seal.

Honestly, if a large shop like my previous employer can't/won't offer lifetime service, I don't know that it would be feasible at a smaller location."
bikewrench,38bdwj,KayceS,2,Wed Jun 3 04:42:34 2015 UTC,"We do lifetime free tune-ups but anything that needs replacing we charge full labor and it ends up working pretty well   We mostly cater to casual riders and children though, so, assuming we were the last to touch it, a full checkover should take like twenty minutes (and if it's obvious we weren't, we charge at discretion)   People that buy high end bikes normally came to us initially with other outside bikes and have come to appreciate our service(in a super dense area of bicycle shops I really believe we have the most competent detail oriented mechanics[it's insanely absurd the shoddy mickey mouse jobs that come out of ""high end"" shops]) and purchase parts at msrp as opposed to mail order /online  who, more often than not, sell products cheaper than our cost (yea, it's fucking ridiculous)   So in the end I think things are not too bad...  You get frugal families that become lifetime customers because of the servicing and really only come in every year or three, if that, and gives you a great selling point over other shops  Also it's a bargaining chip for people trying to hassle you on the price...  ""well, yea, I guess I could give you forty bucks off the price but I'd have to take away the lifetime servicing, which is free and each time worth a sixty dollar tuneup"""

If so, your problem is probably cable tension.  If not, your problem is probably your high limit screw.  Of course, check FD alignment and height.  Parallel to the frame, just high enough so the cage doesn't hit any teeth."
bikewrench,38aucy,55555thatisfivefives,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:38:49 2015 UTC,+1.  Cable tension is almost always the culprit here.
bikewrench,389r7v,Namenotwanted,2,Tue Jun 2 20:31:29 2015 UTC,A screw extractor might do the trick.
bikewrench,389r7v,aleslie22,2,Tue Jun 2 21:22:14 2015 UTC,"Haven't worked with these cranks, but it looks like the 8mm bolt unthreads CCW, pressing against the 10mm cap to push the crank off the spindle. Is that correct? If so, I would proceed in one of two ways:   Try to finesse out the remainder of the 10mm cap (you may want to tighten the 8mm a quarter-turn to give you enough slack to do so). Then, loosen the 8mm bolt until it's only got 2-3 threads engaged and go ride the bike up a big hill in your neighborhood in a tall gear. Hopefully, the high torque will work the crankarm loose from the spindle, and when it comes loose you'll be going slow enough to not hurt yourself. Just keep hauling on the 8mm and see if it'll loosen the crank enough to get it off before you totally thrash the 10mm cap. This would probably be faster than option 1, but you run the risk of screwing up the threads on the crankarm that the 10mm cap threads into, which is a sort of a Big Problem."
bikewrench,389r7v,brokenspoke,3,Tue Jun 2 22:51:47 2015 UTC,"You are 100% correct on the self extractor theory. And as a bonus,  you likely can get a replacement outer cap from another manufacturer.

bikewrench,38alea,ajever01,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:37:42 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't be too much of a problem to fix.  First, make sure that the wheel is straight in its dropouts. Stand over the bike, lean over the bars, apply pressure to the bars with your chest, and re-tighten the quick-release while applying pressure. This alone may fix your problem.  If the brakes are still problematic, Screw IN the spring tension screw that is on the side where the pad is barely moving (right side from youtube view). Then screw OUT the screw on the side where the pad has lots of motion (left side from youtube view).

bikewrench,38acv4,Ilazanja,2,Tue Jun 2 22:37:36 2015 UTC,"The centering screws seemingly work backwards: screw in to move the pad out, screw out to move the pad in. Whatever you do on one side has the opposite effect on the other. You may want to back off the cable tension, center the brake, then retension. Check that a pad is not hanging on the tire, the underside of the rim, or that stupid groove on the middle of many rims.  Two other things to look for: the cable is good and the rim is true."
bikewrench,38acv4,greencannondale,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:17:39 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'll give this a shot tomorrow. I'll try removing the tension and see if it makes a difference. I understand the screws work backwards but I just wasn't seeing any movement at all from either side regardless of the direction I was screwing.

Definitely use the grease, especially if you don't have an end cap. It will keep the bolt from seizing, which would be a real pain if you have to replace the bottom bracket. Basic silicone bike grease should only be around $7 and one tube will last you a long time.  Make sure you torque it down, you're way more likely to leave it too loose and risk destroying the crank arm than you are to strip the bolt. Shoot for, I don't know, 25 to 35 ft-lbs. Ride it a few days, then torque it again to make sure it's all seated."
bikewrench,3862mn,GhostwithBoner,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:05:30 2015 UTC,I kinda expect a cap to come with the arm but usually the bolt is sold with the bottom bracket. If the bolt is not torn up it should be fine to reuse. Note: the 45 degree square taper is less common.

Any other measurement will define the ride character of the frame but not the fit. These images should give you an idea about what they are. But if you already have the frame at hand and the geometry of next year's model, just measure the head tube and check the chart. I bet 99.9% that they are the same.  2- You can run 6800 but you'll just need a FD collar. My advice on the other hand is to go with the 5800. It's just as good as 6800 and costs cheaper.

Some people say what you said, some say Ultegra is noticeably better, some say clean cables & housings make a bigger difference than anything.

For example, my '75 vintage steel has 52/18 and it's my all time favorite gear ratio. With my CF Trek I have to shift between 52/17 and 19 and it's annoying. I managed to build a bike that weighs 7,2kg but to my surprise, it doesn't climb itself. I am seriously considering upgrading to 5800 from my 6700 because the 12-25 5800 cassette is perfect for the type of riding I do.

With a professional mechanic that is way less likely. However, in my mind any decent bike shop would not just take money off you over and over again to retrue a wheel that is just going to become untrue again. It also suggests that the rim has been buckled to the point where the shape it likes to rest at is out of true, which a decent mechanic should be able to identify, at least on the second time of seeing the wheels. Not saying you should take this info to the shop and complain, it could be as easily explained as a different mechanic working on it each time.  Whatever, the wheels are toast. Properly tensioned wheels that haven't ever been badly buckled should stay in true basically forever unless they're being abused, though on cheaper bikes like this they were likely never tensioned as well as a handbuilt wheel would be. Since you say it's both wheels (the back wheel is both weaker and takes more punishment, 9/10 with abuse people just buckle the back wheel) and it's just from heavy braking abuse is not going to be the cause."

Could it be that the axle is moving in the dropouts (where the axle is held in the frame)? If that's the case, it cam probably be prevented by tightening the nuts or the quick-release.  Edit: To find out if the wheel is out of true, spin it by hand and watch the rim where it passes the frame. If the rim wobbles side to side or up and down while the wheel is spinning freely, then your wheel is out of true."

bikewrench,382trg,SmartToaster,3,Mon Jun 1 23:00:32 2015 UTC,"you can watch on youtube how to build a bike from scratch. Thus you get a idea of which tools you would need.  Hint: You need tools, but a beginner could achieve it. Perhaps save the frame for better days?"

bikewrench,382trg,hithazel,2,Mon Jun 1 20:28:42 2015 UTC,"You should see if your shop or a co-op in the area has tools that you can just use to tool around with the bike yourself. Most shops are very cool about this sort of thing if you are a regular.  From the problems you are describing, your bike is probably not fixable for less than $2-300 since it needs so many parts and parts individually are often more expensive than they are in a whole bike.  Honestly you can probably buy a new bike with similar or better components for cheaper from china. If you are fixing your bike, you'll have to look at it more as a learning experience and a labor of love."
bikewrench,382trg,WuTangDan,7,Mon Jun 1 14:58:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know of any shops that would be even a little bit cool with lending out tools for this kind of thing. If a mechanic suggested work for somebody's bike and they declined, then asked to borrow the tools needed for them to do it in the middle of the shop, that person would be told to take a hike. There is nothing wrong with getting advice or borrowing an allen key to tweak your saddle height. Just don't be the ""Hey can I borrow a..."" guy.  That said, this is what bike co-ops are all about. Most are full of knowledgeable volunteers and larges pools of used parts to keep repair costs down. Just make sure you find a way to say thanks. A few bucks, some old parts, or a couple hours of your time are the best ways."
bikewrench,382trg,hithazel,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:04:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe not bikes-r-us type shops that cater to people who don't know shit about bikes and buy new bikes that sit in the garage, but if you ride with these people all the time and they know you from everyone else because you are in the store to see what's new and to keep your gear in shape, at least for me it would be easy to ask to use a stand and some tools in the early morning or after hours as long as I am paying for the parts.  My town is a bit smaller and there isn't an actual bike co-op here so in some ways the small shops perform that function, I suppose."
bikewrench,382trg,WuTangDan,3,Mon Jun 1 16:15:33 2015 UTC,"So the smaller shops with less tools, staff and space WILL do this? We have our lifetime customers who can walk into the back too, but if OP had that type of relationship with his shop then he wouldn't be asking us."

Only the shifter will need replacing, and will probably come with a new cable and housing. The derailleur won't need replacement but might need adjustment.   Can you do this? I don't know, I've never met you! Watch some videos and decide for yourself. Not a difficult repair but even simple adjustments can have some pretty big consequences. That said, as long as you remember when it's time to put the tools down there's no reason not to attempt it. You can always have a shop check your work after."

bikewrench,3835d2,55555thatisfivefives,2,Mon Jun 1 20:44:48 2015 UTC,Paid the bike store to replace the shifter and do a tune up. The labor for the shifter replacement would be waved with the tune up. A little over a week later the left shifter broke.  Bought a left three speed shram MRX and replaced it in like 5 minutes total.

Alternatively you can get a pair of MicroShift for a few dollars more, or a pair of Shimano Tourney RS45 shifters for a few more than that.  You're going to need to replace the shift cable as well.  That's not the wrong derailleur for the bike, and it doesn't have two hangers.  It's just a TX35 Tourney derailleur."

But if you want to switch to trigger shifters, now's the time, and triggers can be had for very little more than twisters.  You'd need new grips as well, but they're cheap.  Just get shifters that are made for the same number of gears that you currently have.   You can have your bike store order them, or order them online yourself, whatever floats your boat. You can do both, or you can do just one, whatever floats your boat. A bike shop probably wouldn't charge very much, but yes, you can do it yourself if you can watch a youtube video and follow directions.  :-)   Now, the unasked questions:  Yes, you may want to swap out cables and housings along with the shifters if you can.  They're cheap, and worn-out housings can be sloppy, in terms of how they shift.  Yes, you should clean and re-lube that chain.  :-)"
bikewrench,3835d2,tmwk,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:42:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed reply.   What is the housing? I planned to lube the chain, what do you clean it with?"
bikewrench,3835d2,tmwk,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:10:14 2015 UTC,"The housing is the tube that the black cable goes into.  Brake and shifter cables and housings are different, make sure you get the right ones.  As to cleaning the chain, citrus degreaser and a brush work well.  Clean the cogs and chain rings while you are at it.  When lubing, it really only takes a tiny bit."
bikewrench,3835d2,georgekeele,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:16:14 2015 UTC,"The housing is the black tube that the silver cable goes inside.  Usually when a cable is dull in appearance, and not bright and shiny, I recommend replacing it.  It's usually a good idea to replace the housing as well, since that gets corroded and gummy on the inside, which leads to poor performance.  It's also a good idea to replace the ferrules that are at the ends of the housings when you replace the housing.  It looks like the ferrule going into your derailleur is cracked anyway.  Running a new cable is easy.  You pull out the old cable, insert the new cable, adjust the tension, cut the cable, then cap it with a cable end crimp.  Running new housing is more complicated.  You need to get the length right (it looks too short in your derailleur pic, which is probably why your ferrule is cracked).  After you cut it with cable cutters, the plastic inner sleeve of shift housing is often compressed, so open it back up with a dental pick or something similar.  Brake housing usually has to be filed flat after cutting, because it is a spiral housing.  It really helps to have good quality cable cutters for this.  This is one of the few times I prefer a Pedros tool over a Park tool, but I like the Pedros cable cutters better.  There's a billion ways to clean a chain.  My ""thorough"" method is to take it off the bike, put it in a nalgene bottle with degreaser, shake, rinse with water, and repeat until the water is clear.  Then dry the chain, put it back on the bike, and lube it.  My ""quick"" method is to use a rag to get the gunk off the chain, then use lube to clean the chain, then a rag again, repeat once or twice if necessary, until the chain is acceptably clean.  I tend to avoid aerosol degreasers when cleaning the chain if it's not off the bike, since the degreaser tends to overspray onto pads, rims, etc."

bikewrench,383wua,bikewazowski,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:51:27 2015 UTC,"After some research Schwinn's website doesn't help much. I think the Trailway (sold at target?) is the same bike as the Voyager(sold at WalMart). If that is correct, their site list the voyager as having a sealed cartridge BB. When you removed the stock one, was it threaded?   If it was threaded then a Shimano BB-UN26 is likely your best quality and least expensive option. You will still need to determine the spindle length, as it sets a proper chain line based on the crankset you have. If you still have the old one, it may be marked on the bottom, you are looking for numbers like ""107mm"" or ""110mm"", etc. If it is not marked, you can measure it with a caliper, or a quality ruler if you can do it within 1mm of accuracy.     EDIT: if you have Amazon Prime this is a great opportunity to take advantage of the fast shipping and free returns in case you end up with the wrong BB."

bikewrench,383wua,55555thatisfivefives,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:00:19 2015 UTC,The process at least is: figure out what size/type BB your frame requires; probably 68mm/English but it depends on where you are and how old your bike is.  Someone here could probably tell you what you have is you tell us what your bike is.  Then pick out what crank you want.  Then pick a bottom bracket that fits your frame and crank.

bikewrench,383wua,GhostwithBoner,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:51:36 2015 UTC,"You measure the bottom bracket shell from one outside face to the other.  Typically this is either 68mm or 73mm.  For bottom brackets with spindles (like square taper, ISIS, Octalink, etc), measure the spindle length from one outside face to the other, like you did with the bottom bracket shell.  It's helpful to have a set of calipers for this.  They're inexpensive and you'll find you have a million uses for them.  For external BB like MegaExo, GXP, etc, you typically use them with a specific crankset, with or without certain spacers depending on what you get.  BB30/BB90/BB92/PF30 etc are totally different and don't screw into your frame like the above ones.  Have you pulled your cranks and BB yet?  Are you looking to replace your crankset and BB with something identical, or looking for something different?"
bikewrench,382z0m,vagittarius,6,Mon Jun 1 14:03:34 2015 UTC,I had the same issue.  You can't use Pinhead skewers with horizontal dropouts.  There's no way to get them tight enough.  Sorry.  Use the Pinhead for the front wheel and put your U-lock through the rear wheel + rear triangle when you lock your bike.
bikewrench,382z0m,icanhazroadbike,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:33:25 2015 UTC,You might not want to hear it OP but this is the correct answer. I had the same problem as you.   Options that might work are something like a chain-tensioner or Surly's Hurdy Gurdy which works for semi-horizontal dropouts. But you will never get enough clamping force out of the pinhead without breaking it. (Which happened to me).   Since I have a shimano hub I will be converting the bike to bolt-on wheels and picking up some pit locks for solid axles...when I have the cash.
bikewrench,382z0m,Aun_vre,2,Mon Jun 1 17:13:52 2015 UTC,"Steel frame? Are the clamping surfaces on these pinheads aluminum? If so, I have no solution for you other than better qrs and a cable lock for the wheels. To effectively prevent the wheel from being pulled forward by the chain tension, the qr needs to have hard steel grippy surfaces where it contacts the frame. Most aftermarket qrs don't bite well enough. You want old school ones like Shimano or Campagnolo."
bikewrench,382z0m,Hagenaar,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:23:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, steel frame, but the disc that contacts the frame there is steel.  Photo if you care to look, the black disk with the ""wings"" contacts the frame: https://www.pinheadlocks.com/store/9-thickbox_default/front-wheel-lock.jpg  I did not have this problem with the bike's stock wheel, but I'd only used the Pinhead skewer for a week or so then. I admit I have not tried riding with the hub's original quick release skewer, which I should do to narrow the problem down."
bikewrench,382z0m,Hagenaar,2,Mon Jun 1 14:31:37 2015 UTC,"In this case, I'd say the lack of secure hold is due to the lack of mechanical advantage of a proper qr lever. You have to twist those pinheads on. Many years ago, on a cold wet day, Tullio Campagnolo decided there must be a better way."
bikewrench,382z0m,Hagenaar,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:59:10 2015 UTC,"I used other screw-down style security skewers before I got the Pinheads and never had a problem, but maybe I just got lucky."

bikewrench,380mk5,Iboughtthewrongchain,5,Sun May 31 23:48:32 2015 UTC,"1 - Since you're talking about going to a smaller cassette all you need is to make sure it is a 10-speed Shimano/SRAM cassette.  2 - Match chain to cassette.  3 - Yes, though you can also shorten your chain.  You don't need to, but you can and it will keep tension higher.  4 - I have no problem with my PF30 bottom bracket.  If you truly have BB30 bottom bracket (they take the same cranksets, just mate with the frame shell slightly differently) you're more likely to encounter problems from what I've heard, but not guaranteed.  That said if you're getting a new crankset now is the cheapest time to get into a HollowtechII or GXP setup."

bikewrench,380mk5,cleansoap,5,Mon Jun 1 00:47:06 2015 UTC,"Campy does their own thing.  There's some instances of cross-compatibility but even in the cases where their cassette spacing lines up with Shimano, their cassettes have different splines in them and thus need different freehubs.  So if you already have a SRAMANO drivetrain you'd need to add more parts to your upgrade list to exit that ecosystem."

I wouldn't consider changing a cassette an upgrade. Cheap cassettes work just as well as expensive ones in my experience. The only difference is weight. Now if you change the cassette because you want different gearing then go right ahead. Just make sure to replace it with a Shimano or Sram cassette (Campagnolo won't fit your freehub on your rear wheel)."

bikewrench,37yrvq,brian2686,30,Sun May 31 15:24:46 2015 UTC,"Some factors that affect speed are (in no particular order)    Weight Rolling resistance Aerodynamics resistance in the drivetrain rider position/frame geometry   Rider ability should be discounted here because you asked what makes the bike fast.  As in: if you ride two bikes, which do you go faster on, assuming you are equally accustomed to both.  Lighter bikes accelerate faster.  Lighter wheels in particular, as you are spinning that weight round and round and not just accelerating it forward.  If the drivetrain is clean/new, it will run more smoothly.  A gummed up chain or badly shifting gears sap performance.  Once you are up to speed, aerodynamics play a role.  This is why some folks will ride 25mm tires over 28mm.  There's not much difference in rolling resistance, but there is a difference in aerodynamics.  Rolling resistance is a topic of endless discussion, but it's essentially the tire's resistance to deformation as it goes from a round cross-section (as it is where it's facing you, at the top) to flatter, as it is when it's facing down, contacting the pavement.  A smaller diameter tire has less rolling resistance than a fat one (but ONLY at higher pressure.  At the same pressure the fat one actually deforms less and rolls more easily).  The smaller diameter tire lets you pump it to a higher pressure, and enjoy some reduced rolling resistance.    Finally, the geometry of the bike plays a large role in the leverage it allows you to get on the pedals.  If you're riding upright on a banana seat and sissy bars on your island cruiser with bread basket you're not going to get any leverage vs a set of drop bars or low risers that might keep you in an aggressive, yet less comfortable position for a beginner.  Bikes that have the seat as high or a little higher than the contact points for the riders hands on the bars usually put you in a more aggressive position where you can pedal harder more consistently, and this will result in a faster bike, too.  Finally, factoring rider skill in, if the geometry is right, a bike can be comfortable to control at high speed.  If it is, you can ride it faster more safely.  This isn't strictly making the bike faster, as it factors the rider in, but if you can ride  it faster, it's a faster bike.  A little circular, I know, but hopefully that helps you."

bikewrench,37yrvq,SgtBaxter,2,Mon Jun 1 00:55:29 2015 UTC,"The smaller diameter tire lets you pump it to a higher pressure, and enjoy some reduced rolling resistance.   This is only partly true, in many cases higher pressure leads to higher resistance. Particularly if the road you're on isn't smooth as glass... as it takes more energy to lift the mass of the bike and rider up in the air over a bump then it does to deform the tire around it. Especially true for MTB tires, and why I like tubeless so I can run less than 20psi.   A lot of roads I cycle on are tar/chip, which are kind of bumpy. If I'm cycling a route that has a lot of those, I'll put my tires at around 105 psi. If I'm riding smooth road mainly I'll pump them to 130 or so and endure the few bumpy sections. I've found out through trial and error that seems to work pretty well."

You can swap out for speedier road tires, keep them properly inflated.  Tune up could help to ensure everything is aligned (wheels trued, derailleurs and drivetrain aligned, brakes aren't rubbing), bolts are torqued properly, and everything is greased and lubed properly. All those things could add up.  Use your gears properly, keep a high-ish cadence, will hep to increase your average speed."

bikewrench,37yrvq,redfiche,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:18:53 2015 UTC,"Replacing the chain is often necessary if it has never been done.  But that brings itself new problems.  If the chain is very old and worn, it may have deformed your rear cassette and or chainring.  Luckily, they don't have to be expensive at all to replace.  If your gears look like shark's teeth ^ and come to a point, it's best to replace them.  A new chain will just slip because it can't grab worn teeth.    I'm new to bikes too actually.  Just got into them about 2 months ago and already stripped down two bikes and rebuilt them with just youtube, Google and pictures.  Very important, take pics of the bike before you take stuff off.  You can do everything your LBS can do on bikes.  It's just a matter if your time is worth more and if you have any interest in fixing it yourself.  And you will need tools.  A socket and wrench set are very helpful as well as an allen set.  I tend to hoard the stupid allen wrenches you get with furniture as they come in all sorts of sizes and this has worked great on my bikes.  You're going to need specific tools too like a chain breaker, wire cutter, chain whip, etc.  There are ways to get around using the tools but I found it's not worth it if I am going to do this on other bikes and I already saved a ton on labor cost.    I remember taking my rear wheel off and two parts just flew out of the center shaft.  I had no idea what they were, how they were supposed to be put back or how to put them back.  But I sat there and eventually figured it out and what the problem was.  I thought ""this might be a LBS thing"" at first but it really isn't that difficult once you look at how things are connected and remember bikes are really simple."

bikewrench,37yrvq,GoonCommaThe,4,Mon Jun 1 15:19:36 2015 UTC,"One thing I didn't see mentioned here is to make sure your wheel hubs turn really freely. This falls under the heading of rolling resistance, but is commonly forgotten.  The wheels can seem to have low friction when there is no weight on them. But with a rider on the bike, the friction is multiplied many times. You want there to be absolutely no crunchy feel or sounds.  Actually doing the service on your hubs isn't hard, exactly. You'd need some tools and plenty of patience (it can be a little fiddly to reassemble). But a lbs shouldn't charge too much for that service, if you do need it."

A good way to start wrenching is to find a local bike co-op that provides tools, advice, and workspace. In NYC, you should be able to find one that you like with no trouble."

bikewrench,37yrvq,gkevinkramer,3,Mon Jun 1 15:14:48 2015 UTC,As far as speeding up an existing bike. Make sure components in the drive train are running smoothly so the minimum amount of energy is lost. Get slicker tires to reduce rolling resistance and if you really want to get a higher speed change your gears to bigger front sprockets smaller rear sprockets which will obviously require a higher level of fitness to maintain   Keep in mind the faster you go the more of an impact air resistance will hold you back particularly on a mtb frame as the frontal area you present is quite large you can tuck yourself in a bit by holding the centre of your bar and curving the back as much as possible but if you are in NYC this is probably not advisable.

bikewrench,37yrvq,o0260o,4,Mon Jun 1 21:20:20 2015 UTC,"Every Wednesday, there's an incredibly high intensity group ride that simulates racing quite well. Average speeds around 22-23 mph for 33 miles and 1300 ft of elevation gain. On my fancy 15 lb carbon fiber bike, I am humbled when I get snapped off by guys on 1983 Treks with downtube shifters and a 1992 Specialized steel frame with randonneur bars. Seeing these guys blow by me makes me realize, while riding upgrades may improve my own speeds with very little effort from my part, there is no replacement for hard work and determination.   Now with that said, there are some incredibly easy gains that can be made to your bike, assuming you are working at a high heart rate on your current bike that could potentially push you even harder to the limit. Thinner tires with a smoother contact patch, drop bars for getting more aerodynamic, clipless pedals for better engagement and power throughout, and a higher gear ratio if you're spinning out on your current one, will make big differences in your speeds. If you aren't really pushing it on your current bike though, I would start doing that first. You'll get much bigger gains improving your engine than most parts ever will  I know this is all anecdotal, but the fastest I ever rode on my Walmart bike was 15 mph for about 20 miles. I now average about 20 mph for anything shorter than 40 miles. And this is after shedding 15 lbs off my bike (from Walmart to CF), and having bigger leg muscles.

Considering the bike is 20 years old or more, replacing these parts on the bike a good idea anyway. Using sheldon's gear inches calculator, a 48t chainring to a 13t cog gives 90 gear inches which I think is probably high enough. If he scrounges ebay he could probably find NOS chainrings for cheaper."

And the phrase ""act of god"" does not rely on one believing in a deity.  My point was a tube imperfection which at that very moment finally decided to go is the only possibility if all you have stated is true and if nothing else is true.

It is essentially a very long nut that slides through the frame mounting hole on one side (the right in your case) all the way until its flush with the outside face of the mounting tab on the opposite side (left). Then a small bolt is threaded into this piece from the opposite (left) side. I would thread the bolt that you took off back on slightly, and tap gently on its head until the bolt face on the other side is no longer against the frame's mounting tabs. Then you can slide something thin (like a tire lever) under the bolt face and work it out farther. Usually really easy to remove with fingers once you've got the bolt face off the mounting tab."

Look at the top of the tire and see if you notice it ""hop"" at some point along the rotation. If you don't notice a hop but the wheel still feels like it's lagging in some point of the rotation, it's likely a bearing issue (assuming the brakes aren't rubbing at any point)"
bikewrench,37zs9z,D0rk4L,2,Sun May 31 20:15:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, thank you for this. Just went and tested this out. It looks like its moving upwards at some points, like a wave coming at me. It does not rock left or right, or rub the brake pads.   Think it might just need another new tube?"
bikewrench,37zs9z,D0rk4L,6,Sun May 31 20:21:43 2015 UTC,"Do it again, but watch the rim this time. I like to look at the top edge of the braking surface as it's usually a machined silver color that contrasts well with the black tire. Watch that for the hop. If the rim doesn't hop, it's the tire. It may just be seated poorly. Deflate, check the bead and re-inflate, then go around the tire on both sides and look for any spots where it may look uneven. If it's the rim, a hop can only be removed by some truing work on the wheel, best done by a bike mechanic."

bikewrench,380ekr,Sir_Slaughter33,4,Sun May 31 22:43:40 2015 UTC,"To make sure everything is explicit: moving the chain/derailleur by hand isn't going to do it, you need the cable to be tight enough to pull the derailleur to that last gear and hold it there.  Shift to your hardest (smallest) back gear to let out all the tension, unclamp the cable, then pull it hand-tight and re-clamp it.  Test shifting and increase tension with the barrel adjuster if it still has trouble pulling the chain up the gears/onto the last gear.  DON'T TOUCH THE SCREWS unless you find that no amount of tension gets the chain riding well on that last gear."

bikewrench,380ekr,ThaGuySP,2,Mon Jun 1 14:23:46 2015 UTC,You need to get it to that point and then get the slack out of the cable by reclamping it.  Then check to see if it's tight enough to pull the chain up one gear with each click.

As long as the cable pull ratio is the same a 9-speed derailleur will work for 10 and 8 speed to. You just need to set the limits and cable tension.  9 speed shifters with 8 speed drivetrain on the other hand. That won't work well

One follow up question though...  I have a SRAM 8-speed derailleur and shifter now... so I would think that, if I did replace the derailleur, I'd be able to keep my current shifter.  But I see some comments about manufacturers changing the cable pull ratio, even within their own lines.   So would an 8-speed shifter from 2006 (or so) work with a modern SRAM X.9 derailleur, for 8-speed?  Or would I need a new shifter as well?

I guess I had always assumed (wrongly) that there was actually something in the derailleur itself that defined how many stop there were. Thanks for all the comments explaining this.   This is how Shimano Poistron shifting worked.  It was one of the first indexed shifting groups and it was for the lowest of the low end bikes.  The RD has several notches on a plate to represent the positions and when you move the derailleur another part would slide into those notches.  This RD did not have a spring to move in either direction so it initially used two wires and later a solid wire between the shifter to push and pull the RD."

What has changed, however, in Shimano land is that 11 speed road and 10 speed mountain are on different pull ratios than  all (?) indexed shifting which came before.  9 speed mountain and 10 speed road are compatible, for example, but 11 speed road is its own, third, thing and 10 speed mountain is its own, second thing.  EDIT:  and in SRAM land the ratio changed (roughly) a generation earlier.  Then it changed a second time for MTB."

The whole set isn't really all that expensive and sugino makes a lot of different sizes of chainrings so you can fine-tune your gearing to suit the riders.

Have you visually checked if the derailleur looks bent?  One can quite often see when the RD cage is not parallel to the wheel/cassette simply by looking ""through"" the back end.  THAT SAID if aligning the hanger literally stopped the noise each and every time you did it, and your indexing was good, that sure sounds like proof the RD itself is straight."

bikewrench,37u14j,MinimusNadir,2,Sat May 30 14:38:35 2015 UTC,"Is it likely that my derailleur is bent?   One of the ideas of a hanger is that it will bend before the derailleur, at least in theory.  In practice, I see both hanger and derailleur bent at least as often as just the hanger.  The fact that your hanger keeps bending makes me leery, but hey, fatigue could certainly explain it, and stranger things have happened.  I'd at least inspect the dropout very carefully to make sure that no hairline cracks or anything are present.  I'd also inspect the derailleur very carefully, make sure fasteners are appropriately tight, no excess wiggle/slop, nothing visually bent, etc..  If the dropout and derailleur look good, I'd throw the new hanger on, verify that the derailleur functions, and go from there.  If that solves it and the problem doesn't reappear, terrific."

But, that Athena is a bit more pricy, I'd be inclined to do at least a little more investigation before throwing bills at it.  So...no difference in clicking, but the new derailleur is nice and straight, correct?  If it's just clicking, is it clicking in certain cogs, or in all of them?  Are you able to adjust the cable to make it work correctly in any cog?    This is the sort of thing where having the bike in the stand and being able to watch the positioning and behavior of the derailleur and chain during pedaling and shifting can be quite helpful.  It's also conceivable that you've somehow damaged the cassette or individual cogs/teeth, so it might not hurt to go over that with a fine-toothed comb."
bikewrench,37urle,uluchay,4,Sat May 30 15:52:25 2015 UTC,"It depends on the pump. When you attach the pump to the valve (and open the valve), the tube connecting the piston to the connector becomes pressurized. How much air this lets out of the tire depends on the volume of this tube (and other details of the pump construction).  How much the pressure actually drops when you let a certain amount of air out of the tires depends on the volume of the tires.  For a large floor pump with a long tube (and such narrow tires), 20 psi doesn't sound unreasonable.  But you can do a quick experiment to figure out how much is due to the tire back-pressurizing the pump. Just pump up to your ride pressure, disconnect the pump, and then immediately reconnect it. The tire has not had time to leak, so whatever drop you see is how much the pump steals."
bikewrench,37urle,thalience,4,Sat May 30 16:39:24 2015 UTC,"This would be accurate for shrader valve, not presta.

You could test this in about 5 seconds.  Pump to 110.  Disconnect pump.  Connect pump.  What does gauge say?  If lower you know damn well it didn't come from tube leakage.
bikewrench,37urle,cleansoap,3,Sun May 31 11:33:01 2015 UTC,"An easy experiment to perform would be to pump them up every other day for a couple of weeks.  Then see what the difference is between 1 day vs 2 days between refills (all other things being equal).  If you find yourself adding the same amount of air over 2 days that you added over 1 day, then try 3 days between refills.  Add days until the difference becomes something other than negligible.  And please report back if you do.  :)"

bikewrench,37sxq3,SavingHawaii,1 point,Sat May 30 03:55:33 2015 UTC,Yeah it seems pretty weird. The only thought I had was over tensioning but that doesn't quite make sense since it's happening on a couple of non-drive side nipples and I don't see any cracks in the rim.
bikewrench,37sxq3,Aun_vre,1 point,Sat May 30 04:05:01 2015 UTC,I'd guess just a bad batch from the factory.  It happens.
bikewrench,37sxq3,Aun_vre,2,Sat May 30 06:49:49 2015 UTC,"Brass nipples are the preferable nipples for any and all wheel builds. Aluminum or ""Alloy"" nipples tend to strip out easier due to having have weaker threads, require more prep-work then self-lubricating brass, crack more easily and can seize in place.   Unless you need to save 20 more grams, most wheel builders use brass. But it is rotational weight at the rim...sometimes those grams have to go.     There are other sizes of park wrenches then red and green there are also grey black and blue. It sounds like you have the wrong one. Stop using it.   If you want nicer nipple wrenches the Park Master and the DT Swiss Wrenches grab the nipple on 3 sides I have never had them damage a nipple (Provided you are using the correctly sized tool for the job)    As far as why... What kind of wheel is it? What kind of bike? How much did the rider weigh? What kind of conditions did they ride in? Did they ride year round in Snow and Salted roads? Was the wheel hand built, or machine built? Was it the stock wheel-set on the bike?   Two years of daily use on an OEM machine-built wheelset on say a hybrid is great performance. You should thank your lucky stars it lasted that long. Cut your losses and have a mechanic hand-build you a nice durable commuter wheels if you plan on using it the same way."
bikewrench,37sxq3,amateurscience,1 point,Sat May 30 03:52:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comments, I'm thinking maybe the nipples were originally ""green"" (doesn't seem to be a size in between red and green) and sloppy truing by gorilla friend has made that wrench not fit on most of them...hmm  It was a Linus 1x city bike about $500 probably machine-built wheels, ridden daily rain or shine no snow over roads and gravel multiuse path by a guy maybe 180lbs? Cleaned pretty regularly too. I think it was trued by a mechanic to start with but my friend trued it in the frame as well. Tension seems even if a bit high.  You are right about 2 years heavy use being good performance for a stock wheel, I'm mostly curious if anyone has seen this sort of thing before as I have not."

bikewrench,37qhve,redfoxiii,14,Fri May 29 16:53:05 2015 UTC,"Drum brakes are heavy. They also lack power, particularly compared to discs (which are basically ubiquitous now). Add to that the necessarily fidgety mechanics (since they are internally braked, and adjustments are made on the outside, which makes for blind trial and error playing around to set up and fix actuation issues ) and bad parts availability, and you have a setup I'd rather avoid."

I've had a lot of trouble adjusting disc brakes and replacing pads compared to rim brakes, though I still keep bikes from both camps around.  And don't get me started on warping rotors, pad contamination, and accidentally knocking pads out of alignment when installing wheels when on the side of the road (one little slip-up is all it takes)."
bikewrench,37qhve,redfoxiii,5,Fri May 29 16:39:42 2015 UTC,"The big thing, to me, is how common they are vs anything else. You see disc and rim breaks every day.

Since you're going for broke here anyway, take a look at the 70mm or 90mm dynamo hubs, since you'd have a permanent set of lights with endless power with them at not much extra cost (most of the dynamo cost is the custom front wheel).  A high-end set of battery lights will cost more than a midrange set of dynamo lights, but will wear out much more quickly with charge cycles.  Coaster brakes aren't like drum brakes; they use a different mechanism for actually applying friction."

It's not an unreasonable price at all, for the laziest light ever.  Of course, you also need a lamp and a room and spikes and mounting, and if you're having it made custom, it quickly adds up, but the hub in and of itself, isn't that expensive."

bikewrench,37qhve,lperohgf0348y80y,3,Sun May 31 12:19:08 2015 UTC,"I've been riding a 70mm front drum/dynohub for going on 5 years now, it's been rock solid. It gets used almost every day for urban commuting, the lights are so awesome when you use a B&M or other German light they have reflectors that put the light on the ground so you can actually see, I know there are lots of crazy-bright battery lights out there because jerks have them all pointed straight ahead into my eyes but I enjoy the dynamo lights that put the light on the ground. Never having to change batteries or charge up my lights is also super-convenient and makes riding even easier, just unlock and go.   I've read you can use aluminum tubing to make a kind of ""rigid"" cable housing to increase the power on these things. I've been meaning to change my brake housing over to something more high-end but haven't got around to it. I think salt water from the winter has rusted up all the steel bits on the outside of my hub but it still stops me fine. If you ride in the rain/winter you'll wanna grease or anti-seize all the barrel adjusters and pinch-bolts, the chrom plating or whatever SA does for their metal is completely inadequate.   A new drum brake hub will take a good while to ""bed in"" properly, I figure it was about 100km of riding to get it nice. I've never had mine fade due to heat buildup but I don't live in the mountains so that's not a thing I have to worry about.   You can also fabricate a longer reaction arm as well, apparently that increases the stopping power. I can't find it right now but I used to have a page bookmarked about a UK mountain biker that was doing similar things to drum brake hubs back in the day. If I ever remember any details about I will try and post a link."

Essentially it comes down to the chainline, and I am sure if you check you will find that in your lowest gear your chainline is off quite significantly. This is normal in modern bikes with larger ratio cassettes and is merely a side effect of physically having so many sprockets in the rear. The reason it slips when you are back pedalling is because the teeth on the sprocket are designed to grip when pressure is applied in a clockwork motion.  I wouldnt worry about it too much if your bike is otherwise functioning correctly. If your bike shows any other symptoms or has any more issues then i would look at correcting the chainline through the correct use of bottom bracket spacers.

So BB30/PF30 are out except in cases revolving around very specific 30mm spindle cranks from brands like Rotor.   Shimano only deals with Hollowtech-2, which is a 24mm standard that mates perfectly with BSA shells using a HT2 bottom bracket. FSA uses the same standard for their MegaExo cranks. FSA's BB386 is a different beast. Truvativ/SRAM are either GXP or BB30/PF30. GXP is a 24mm spindle that also commonly works with BSA BB shells. BB30 does not. BB90 is some bullshit that Trek does. It's basically a wider press-fit version of BSA. BB86 and BB92 are also basically PressFit BSA and are built for 24mm spindle cranks."

bikewrench,37sja7,cleansoap,1 point,Sat May 30 01:29:18 2015 UTC,"Right. The reason they can do this is because it's a longer spindle than BB30/PF30 spindles. Since you have to put the bearings outboard of the frame to run a 30mm spindle through a BSA shell, you effectively widen the shell beyond what BB30 was designed for, where the bearings sit within the width of the existing shell.

Rim strength, spoke count, time spent riding on the broken spokes, frequency of the spoke breaking, etc, can all play a factor. I tend to side with the 3-4 end of things. If someone is breaking that many spokes, something isn't right. Either the wheel is not the proper setup for the riders needs, was built up with poor components or has just seen so much abuse that it can never be returned to a solid setup."

As long as you're taking tension out when you replace the spokes and retensioning the wheel properly most wheels can go through more than a few spokes being replaced over time. That is assuming the rim or hub don't have problems of their own. That being said, if someone is blowing 3-4 spokes at a time something is very off."

I was blowing a single spoke just about every ride on my back tire. After this happening about 3 or 4 times I ended up taking the rim to the lbs and having them restring it with some beefier spokes. If 3 or 4 would have broken at the same time, I would have considered a new rim as to me that implied something was really wrong. I am pretty sure my issue was weight related, and now with beefier spokes and a lot of weight loss if a spoke breaks it should be just wear and tear."

bikewrench,37px9x,anonanon1313,3,Fri May 29 15:19:34 2015 UTC,"Unless physically damaged (eg dropped chain) spokes fail from fatigue. Fatigue is from uncorrected spoke line and/or residual manufacturing stresses. After correcting the spoke lines and stress relieving it's impossible to know how much fatigue has accumulated in the surviving spokes, but since the load cycle now should be below the fatigue threshold, no additional fatigue should accrue. In other words, the remaining spokes may last forever."

When spokes start breaking, you should check the tensions and truing on the wheel to see what's up and probably do some other stuff like stress relieving (the proper way, not the BS way where you press on the rim and hear little pops)."

bikewrench,37px9x,illustribox,1 point,Sat May 30 01:58:28 2015 UTC,"Across the hub.  Same side doesn't really have parallel spokes.  There are a lot of debates, and there are a number of valid ways to do it, but once you understand the physics you understand the requirement: it must exceed yield strength, that's the whole point of stress relieving, and that is nearly impossible to do without working individual spokes."
bikewrench,37px9x,einsama,1 point,Sat May 30 05:39:51 2015 UTC,"In my decision making process I always determine why spokes are breaking to inform the decision to rebuild or replace. Is it a new wheel? How well has it been maintained? How does the owner ride their bike? Chain drop damage? Low spoke tension? Rim damage? Quality of hub? And the rate at which the spokes are breaking.  The real question is (and you should be honest with a customer about this) is it worth working on? Can you fix the wheel to meet the customers expectations in a reasonable amount of time? In my shop is general 25 labour and part to fix a broken spoke on the rear wheel. A great deal of the time, i am explaining ""how"" a wheel is showing age/fatigue, or trying to understand if the customer needs a stronger, wheel.  Labour for a wheel rebuild isn't cheap... but it can be worth it if the rim/hub are good. Sometimes is better for the customer to start fresh."

bikewrench,37otze,chocolatemeowcats,5,Sun May 31 20:51:50 2015 UTC,"Bikes don't need tune ups. Chains, brake pads and tires are the basic consumables. You should have a floor pump, basic, generic cleaning stuff. You should learn how to fix flats.  Modern bikes, properly set up, require very infrequent servicing. Bearing lubrication typically lasts for years, ditto for cable replacement. Shifter and brake adjustment is somewhat more variable, but generally at the frequency of annual or less. Many bikes have built-in adjusters for this and require no tools.  Most people get around 3k miles out of a chain, but this is variable. You should learn how to measure a chain for wear. All you need to replace a modern chain is a chain tool, to shorten a new chain, most are sold with tool-less quick connectors.   Chains should be oiled when they get squeaky, wiped down before to remove dirt and after to remove excess oil. Chains should also be wiped/oiled after rainy rides to prevent rusting.  Brake pads should be inspected periodically for embedded grit, which can be picked out with a pointy tool like an awl. This is only a problem for bikes ridden in the rain. Some brake pads are trivial to replace, some are tricky. Some brake designs require alignment as the pads wear. It's not usually a frequent maintenance task.  Fair weather cycling is much less maintenance intensive, rainy riding also requires regular lubrication of moving parts and some stationary parts (eg seat posts) that may be prone to galvanic corrosion (aluminum & steel)."

So, I answered your question on wear when you posted that picture a bit ago. To repeat, more accurately:  No play, no problem. You have play, you have a problem - it's likely your spindle has had it. It won't take much wear to create the kind of play you're talking about, and you have a fair amount.  Unfortunately this is one of the ""replace things until the problem goes away"" kind of problems.

bikewrench,37n4ha,55555thatisfivefives,1 point,Thu May 28 22:12:13 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - it seems unlikely to me that a brand new BB is the culprit.  I mean, it shouldn't be that bad, judging on the appearance in your pic, but the stranger part to me is that BB30 stuff is very very standardized (that was kind of the point). There shouldn't be that kind of play unless the bearings are straight up the wrong size, and they're glued into the plastic press fit cups - in other words, for them to be the wrong size, the manufacturer would had to've put in defective or wrong sized bearings, like they ordered the wrong part, and they would order by the thousands, and that would be a hell of a fuck up.  Add to that the fact that most shops stock SRAM BB30 bb's (it came in a red and white box probably?) and it seems far more likely, to me at least, that the crank is more likely the culprit. And unfortunately there isn't really a way to find that out short of doing what you've done - putting a new one in and trying it."

bikewrench,37mzss,cleansoap,2,Fri May 29 07:12:51 2015 UTC,"You could install a 9spd Shimano MTB derailleur in the ""SGS"" size which would allow bigger cassettes.  It should shift fine with your 10spd road shifter.  With that said, there is a good chance the 30t cog you already have will function just fine for the most part.  The GS derailleur itself is already of the right geometry (in the parallelogram and knuckle) to properly shift up to an 11-32 cassette stack, it's just the total gear capacity you're dealing with now because of the triple.  I'd recommend to go with a chain long enough to clear big-big, and try not to use small-small.  If you just size the chain for small-small, and then try to avoid big-big, you never really know what might lead to it but you COULD accidentally shift into big-big and do some damage."
bikewrench,37mzss,besselfunctions,1 point,Fri May 29 14:30:35 2015 UTC,Chain take up capacity is wholly separate from max cog.  Let's figure out why the B-screw is apparently doing nothing.  That's where the problem lays.

The noise is most likely from the bottom bracket, the two large bearings that the cranks (the arms with the pedals) go through. They could be out of adjustment, or they might not be installed well.  That probably wouldn't cause your chain to skip. On well used bike shop bikes that would indicate mis-adjustment or worn parts, but on department store bikes it could also be caused by flex in the frame or other mistakes in setup.  Other causes of this sound might be how the cranks are attached to the axle that goes through those bottom bracket bearings, or loose bolts that attach the gear to the right arm, or even just the pedals going bad.  Really hard to guess at this, especially because a lot of other conditions can cause very similar symptoms - handlebar clamps, wheel problems, small cracks in the frame..."

bikewrench,37k046,buckarooney,1 point,Thu May 28 10:08:38 2015 UTC,"A well adjusted good quality bike should be pretty quiet. I'd say any unexpected noise should be investigated. If you don't figure out what's causing the noise, you're risking a breakdown that would leave you stranded or lead to a crash.  I'd say most of the potential causes aren't very hard to fix, and an experienced mechanic can probably home in on the problem very quickly and give you advice. At most shops this sort of diagnosis is done before taking the bike in - you'll only pay for the work to fix the problem.  With ~walmart bikes that came into my former shop, that advice often went beyond the problem that brought the bike in. Don't be surprised if the mechanic also suggests brake or gear adjustments, or even a full tune-up, even if the noise is fixed by a couple of skillful turns of a wrench."

Try to wiggle the cranks to find out if they have any play on the axle. If they do, pop the dust caps off, and tighten the bolts/nuts to about 40 Nm (that's about as tight as you can make it with one arm without much effort). No reverse thread here. Then put the dust caps back. 3. Try to move the axle in the bottom bracket. If it has more and a fraction of a mm of play or any resistance, the BB needs to be adjusted or replaced. Post a photo.

A bike store might have spare bits, either just as random fasteners or from reflectors that people throw away (a lot of cyclists remove them as soon as they buy the bike and replace with lights).  If you're talking front/rear reflectors though you really should replace them with a proper light.  Bicycles are required to be sold with reflectors but the reflectors only work under certain conditions and angles, leaving you invisible too much.

The trouble is, the cassette is in the way. To properly measure your rear freehub you will need to have a chain whip and a cassette lockring remover.  You can also ask the bikeshop owner where you bought the bike I guess.  quick check:  If there are no spacers between the cassette and the freehub body I think you are out of luck, and in need of a rear wheel.  If there are spacers between the cassette and the freehub body, than It could still be a 10 speed hub with an 8 speed cassette spacer, so you'd still need to remove the cassette and measure it to know if it's a 10 or 11 speed body."

Make sure to buy a bottle of chain lube and use it after a rainy ride or after x amount of km's, the price is worth it by making chains last longer. 9 speed chainrings won't be a problem, I use 10 speed rings on a 9 speed groupset.  Check the chain for wear, and replace if early. A worn chain eats away at all the rest of your components (and that's more expensive than buying a new chain from time to time)."

bikewrench,37j5pp,catmug,2,Thu May 28 00:33:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if they are exactly the same internally, but they are probably similar to GR-9s. I just stripped mine down and repacked them and it was a pretty simple task. The trickiest part is removing/replacing the dust cap - I ruined mine in the process so replaced them with suitably sized metal discs set in place with a little silicone sealant after the service.  First remove the dust caps - this apparently requires a special tool to do non-destructively. Under the dust cap there are two nuts on the pedal axle and between them there is a small rectangular plate. The outer nut is smaller than the inner nut, which means that both can be accessed independently using a socket set. This helps a lot when trying to get the right tension on the bearings after reassembly. The inner nut is the cone that sits directly against the bearings.  Remove the outer nut, the plate and the inner nut/cone and you will be able to slide the pedal off the axle. Be careful not to drop any of the ball bearings in the process.  The inner and outer bearings contain 12 balls each.  After removing the pedal there is a plastic cone/seal. When I took mine apart all of the inner bearings were stuck to this. Remove this too.  I'm not certain that the inner and outer balls are exactly the same size, so as a precaution I kept them separate during the whole procedure.  After disassembly, clean everything and dry well. Apply grease to the races in the pedal shell and set the balls in place, then reassemble.  To set the tension I found the easiest way was too tighten both nuts right down and then tighten the inner nut back against the outer nut.  Hope this helps :-)"
bikewrench,37j5pp,leanhsi,1 point,Thu May 28 01:05:58 2015 UTC,Super helpful. Never pulled a pedal apart completely so I'm a bit nervous on this one. Probably a high chance of screwing it up :)

Repack and relube them and you should be fine. Also remember to apply loctite on the dust cap threads afterwards or it'll come flying off while riding.

Read something about adjusting these, it's not very hard.   You basically need to screw the cup so far that the axle has no play but still rotates freely, then secure it in that position by tightening the lockring using a tool like this while preventing the cup from moving using a large wrench.   Before you do the above, take the cup out and clean and re-grease the axle and the bearings. Put a bit of grease onto the threads of the cup as well to prevent it from freezing in place over time."

The axle load is spread differently between the bearings, meaning the LH cup dies quite quickly, or the RH tophat shim breaks. Or both. The Shimano style 'conventional' setup seems to have much more longevity per unit.  If you must go GXP, a Hope BB with the GXP spacer kit is a good alternative."

Old road bikes very commonly used a 26.0 bar, the 25.4 diameter bars were the MTB standard and were used on Japanese made handlebars. It's impossible to tell from the picture, but check to see if your bar has ""25.4"" or ""26.0"" printed on it anywhere.  You might want to get a set of modern dual-pivot side-pull road caliper brakes, too. Even with new levers, cables, and housing, those old brakes aren't going to give you great stopping power. Also, you might want to ask your LBS or bike co-op if they have any sets of old friction thumb shifters (old-school MTB style shifters). We always keep some around, and even order in new ones from Sun Race. They're cheap and easy to set up and you'll have no compatibility issues if you are not running them indexed."
bikewrench,37gd8g,stravadarius,1 point,Wed May 27 13:56:00 2015 UTC,"I measured with calipers, so it's almost exactly 25.4.

Just ""friction thumb shifters"" ? I think I'll just find a gear that suits me and ride it like a single speed."
bikewrench,37gd8g,stravadarius,2,Wed May 27 22:29:40 2015 UTC,"""Friction thumb shifters"" should be descriptive enough to get the idea across. If you measured the diameter with calipers and it came out 25.4 then you're probably fine with a 25.4."

The reason I think this might be feasible is because   the forces that forks experience are largely along the direction of motion (braking, hitting the ground, etc.), while the material I'm referring to seems more relevant to lateral forces, and the area of material I'm talking about removing is tiny compared to the cross section of the fork crown.

bikewrench,37efvc,eggplantsforall,2,Wed May 27 18:04:24 2015 UTC,"Really? I thought they didn't have the right pull, but I don't know for sure. I have exactly the same in-line brake levers on my old racer, which has 7spd STI brifters and caliper brakes, and the pull feels a lot shorter on those in-line levers. Maybe those brifters would work, but I'm not sure breaking action/actuation(?) would be confidence inspiring. Those RL520's are nice though, would've like the hoods to be a bit more broad and round though.  But I'm actually using bar-ends for the first time, apart from very shortly trying them in the shop once, and I really like them. I'd probably still prefer brifters if was I doing something like crit racing, but these fit my riding style and my commute very well."
bikewrench,37efvc,eggplantsforall,2,Wed May 27 11:03:00 2015 UTC,"yeah, I totally missed that you were keeping the V brakes. I don't think the pull would work out the sti levers. going to mini-V's or travel agents wouldn't really be worth the $ and effort. I did a conversion a couple of years ago and actually went with these lever/shifters from Retroshift (now Gevenalle). Been very happy with them ever since.  all that said, I love the look of it!"

Similar to SAE having 3, 6, or other combinations of dashes to indicate, it just means the bolt has been case (or otherwise) hardened to a certain spec.

bikewrench,37eyyq,conipto,1 point,Wed May 27 04:18:48 2015 UTC,"Probably the best you can do is tighten it as much as you can.  As far as preventing this from happening again you have a few options.  If you can pull the crank off completely look and see if there is any damage on the spindle. If there is, like if something inside was bent when it fell off before there is a good chance it will happen again and you may have to replace the damage part. (local bike co-op should have lots of affordable options)  Hopefully nothing is damaged in which case I'd still keep an eye on it. The best thing to do is grab each crank and put pressure on them and try and make it pivot in the bottom bracket. If there is any movement (other then it turning like you were pedaling) you may need to adjust the bottom bracket or tighten the crank again.   Good luck!"

bikewrench,37erk9,SavingHawaii,17,Wed May 27 02:26:45 2015 UTC,"The teeth on the cassette have special patterns that assist the dérailleur in shifting.  If the cassette is thrashed it can't help the dérailleur do its job so that becomes cludgy as well.  Furthermore a badly worn chain does not have a few more miles on it.  At this point it is damaging your crankset and you will be replacing the front chainrings as well if you continue to ride on worn out parts.  It will also kill the derailleur pulleys.  It already damaged your cassette (which could probably have been used with your next chain if you'd replaced the chain in a timely manner).  Trying to delay much-needed maintenance is a false economy.  The worn out chain damages everything it touches, some things sooner than others."
bikewrench,37erk9,insompengy,2,Wed May 27 02:33:13 2015 UTC,"Chains are easy to replace.  $15-$50 for most.  Double that for cassettes and rings (plus labor).  Don't ignore it, you'll spend more in the long run.    Having worked on hundreds of bikes from all corners of the world (yay for bike tour events!) I've seen all sorts of bikes and riders who were never informed that bike parts can eventually wear out.  I can't fathom how any bike shop would send their customers out the door like that.  If you ride a ton and don't have a riding buddy (or trusted local mechanic) with a chain tool, you should think about one (ProLink, Park, Rohloff, Shimano TL-CN42)."
bikewrench,37erk9,ThaGuySP,8,Wed May 27 03:42:47 2015 UTC,"If your chain is ""very stretched"", it's going to destroy the cassette, if it hasn't already.

bikewrench,37erk9,ThaGuySP,2,Wed May 27 02:37:46 2015 UTC,"Chainrings being more expensive than the cassette is a key piece of info, thanks.  My thinking is, 1 and 2 are worn but still working, why not just wait till 3 is shot too? And replace the whole shebang?    But if 3 is much more costly, then its worth it to replace 1 and 2 before 3 is ruined.  Thanks."
bikewrench,37erk9,nhluhr,4,Wed May 27 03:59:33 2015 UTC,"Someone else may be able to explain the science of it better, but: a cassette will last you a few chains if you replace them on time.  Front rings will last a LONG time if you take care of the other two.  Cassettes cost maybe twice as much as chains, and cranksets cost four times as much as cassettes.  The only time you should be replacing your whole drivetrain is if you're upgrading."
bikewrench,37erk9,InnocentGun,2,Wed May 27 06:24:21 2015 UTC,Someone else may be able to explain the science of it better   It's because chainrings are much larger so the chain's forces are spread out across many more teeth.

bikewrench,37erk9,shitfucksniffglue,4,Wed May 27 02:36:53 2015 UTC,"It sounds like they know what they are talking about.  You can make a worn drivetrain shift up to a point.  Once its worn enough it becomes difficult to adjust properly.  As others have said the longer you wait the more likely is that you will be replacing the entire drive train(chain rings, chain, cassette)."
bikewrench,37erk9,txbikerider,5,Wed May 27 03:35:27 2015 UTC,"Usually once a chain wears to the point that a chain checker shows it as ""very worn"", you should just replace it.  Stretched is a misnomer, as it's really just wear in the chain rollers that gives enough play link to link to give the overall appearance of ""stretched"".  Start with a new chain, then if you can compare teeth to a newer cassette of similar quality/brand, do that, and if yours looks more pointed than the other, consider replacing that too.  And while it may seem odd that that affects shifting, you have to consider what's happening when you shift a gear:  Your derailluer moves the chain towards another cog, which is offset a specific amount to pick it up and move it over.  if it's worn, that makes that ""pick up"" a little more difficult, and can easily cause it to skip, pick up on the roller itself, etc.. all functionally making things sound like KA CHUNK KABAM KACHUNK KACHIK-CHIK-CHIK clunk. instead of ""chick."" when you shift. :)"
bikewrench,37erk9,kyrsjo,2,Wed May 27 04:24:17 2015 UTC,"If your cassette has any visible wear, it's trash. Putting a new chain without a new cassette will actually make the shifting worse. Most mechanics aren't going to waste their time adjusting a derailleur around a worn out chain because they know it will never work perfectly. Most mechanics care more about doing good work than what it costs you. A good mechanic will tell you what needs to be done, and how much it costs. The answer is yes or no. The guy willing to half-ass the job for half the money is the one screwing you over."
bikewrench,37d527,ColinCancer,4,Tue May 26 19:28:02 2015 UTC,"I still have an old (circa 1998) Magura yellow running on the back of one of my hardtails. It's seen quite a bit of use over the years and is bashed up, but still works pretty much flawlessly.  Maguras are not really as powerful as V brakes, but can be set-up to be a bit more ""on-off""-ey and as such might be suitable for your purpose. The trick is to make sure that the U-booster is correctly installed, and that the pads hit the rim perfectly square, and at the same time (warning, this a serious headache to set up, especially with used systems).  Unlike this comment, I really don't think the length is going to make as much difference as the setup i.e. yes the increased length will make it more spongey, but it will be miniscule compared to effect not setting the brake booster up right (for example).   If you are really concerned about the length you could use some braided hose to minimise the expansion and thus reduce sponginess (however my experience of installing Goodridge braided hoses on a rear Hope disk on my DH bike is that it made no appreciable difference. It did look more pro though and therefore made me faster :P ).  TL;DR: If you take the time to set them up right, Maguras will probably be less spongey than Vs."

I've never noticed a difference with braided vs regular line on any of the setups I've used. (I wonder if the concern is amplified with hydro disc brakes for some reason and so a lot of the concern is being carried over from experience with discs). Admittedly, I've never run a line that long, but I really doubt it'll be a big deal. I'd at least try it and see how it feels. Regarding feel, that's the best feature imho of the Maguras. Once setup correctly (no mean feat the first time around), they're great.   EDIT: I should add that one of the other perks is that they require zero maintenance. I've got a set that have been running since about 1998 that I haven't touched at all. Pop out the pads, slip in a new set (tool-less) and you're good to go.   One pro-tip, the little washer that you put between the mount and the cylinder that you remove to change wheels? Hot glue gun that washer in place. Otherwise you'll lose it one of these days as you swap wheels."

I swapped it for a Magura hydraulic rim set, and they made a huge difference - much more stopping power. The Ute isn't a super long cargo bike though, so I didn't need to run six feet of hose..."
bikewrench,37d527,redfoxiii,3,Tue May 26 21:31:02 2015 UTC,"There's pros and cons for both set-ups. Maguras are favoured over v's as they are generally easier to set up perfectly square with the rim and therefore achieve a much better braking surface.  Spongeyness can be addressed with a booster, braided hosing, ensuring the pads are square and contact at the same time, and as a last resort aluminium backing a (check out Heatsink bikes for these).  From experience though, Magura on canti studs are a nightmare.  I'm not too sure what the mounting system is like now, but I was using maguras evo adaptors, which effectively mount the two slave cylinders on a frame so they have less chance of pivoting on the canti stud.  It works, but it's not great, I found it can move a lot and would generally go for a v brake if you only have canti studs to mount to.  Maguras are best suited to 4 bolt mounts.  If you are looking for a more solid feel with a cable, definitely invest in a good lever, and some linear slick outer cable, it has a real tight weave to ensure lack of flexing."

They come with equal hose length for the front and rear and for some time I used front with the long (looped) hose - I have cut it to the length months later when I got the parts and bleeding kit.  There wasn't much noticeable difference between running long and short hose on the front. I'm not sure about 6-7feet but I'd say you should be fine but a braided hose may be a good idea...  And also make sure to bleed it correctly - it will be harder with a long hose possibly running flat over longer distance.  As for the strength I would say that properly (not easy) set up Maguras with booster are as strong as v-brakes and require less hassle when pads wear due to straight actuation path - adjustment is done on the lever, and when it's time, you just snap new pads and it's done. Also, make sure to do it correctly yourself or if you ask the shop - ensure they know how, once I gave my bike to a shop to switch my fork and they put a nut with a spacer over the boosters open hole (booster is not symmetrical so that it can be removed) that supposed to be just going right over the nut..."

The shifting with tiagra and 105 chain/cassette combos is noticeably slower due to the heavier chain and less machining on the cassette. Even with all Tiagra shifters and mech, swapping in an Ultegra chain and casette will make it feel like you went all out. Plus the Ultegra stuff wears longer. Save your money and stick with the Tiagra rear derailleur, you won't notice a difference between that and the 105.  We've done this on countless Tiagra/105 bikes that came in with worn chain/cassette and most people can immediately tell the difference."

The difference in miles you can get from them depends more on your maintenance than on the type of cassette you bought.  Shifting difference? I don't think anyone can guess what cassette is on if you do a blind test.   On the other hand, I'd go for a better chain than the ""Tiagra"" one. The Tiagra chains only have a silver looking finish on the outer plates, the inner plates look dull and are less easy to keep clean.  A 105 chain should be good enough. If the 105 chain is double the price forget about this all and go Tiagra. Other options are KMC and Sram chains. But again, look for a chain with the same quality finish on both inner and outer plates.  As VR1289 said: The difference those people felt were not due to changing from Tiagra to Ultegra, but rather from worn to brand new and well lubed chains and cassettes."

bikewrench,37d7gy,llama_herder,3,Tue May 26 20:07:35 2015 UTC,"The higher spec chain might be more rust resistant and might be lighter.  But if you're riding daily this may not be hugely beneficial unless you're in a particularly rust prone area.    My chain showed a bit of rust after I cleaned the drivetrain but did not lube it for several days.  A quick scrub with a nylon bristle brush and all the rust was removed.  I'm within a few miles of the Pacific Ocean for what it's worth.   The different group sets sometimes have different gear combinations on the cassette which you might find more useful.  I think Tiagra group, for example, has a 12-30 10 speed cassette that is not available on other groups."

bikewrench,37d7gy,cleansoap,1 point,Tue May 26 20:49:27 2015 UTC,Yes and less front shifting (for most people).  Most non-racers even on compact cranksets very rarely need to be in their big chainring and an 11T cog.  So stealing the 11T and replacing it with a 30T effectively gives the rider an additional gear before needing to downshift the front.

IIRC it's only specced for 28, so derailleur hanger alignment plays a part in capacity so don't kick me if it's too tight (should be easy to see if you have enough b-screw left before ordering).  You're only adding 1T to total chain takeup so you should be fine there as well, though you might want to check that quoted spec. as well.

bikewrench,37d7gy,Stickytapemeasure,2,Tue May 26 23:45:41 2015 UTC,"I had a bike where it was the barrel rotating itself.  I cured the problem by replacing the last segment of housing to the RD itself with (bloody expensive) segmented housing.  It is my theory that the moving RD was meeting resistance in the stiff loop of ""normal"" housing and the force was spinning the barrel."
bikewrench,37d7gy,cleansoap,1 point,Tue May 26 23:53:08 2015 UTC,Perhaps the loop was too tight? Or the cable got contaminated? Did you try lubing the inner cable?
bikewrench,37d7gy,Stickytapemeasure,1 point,Wed May 27 13:14:19 2015 UTC,"I do not believe it was a cable drag issue, rather I think the housing stiffness itself was to blame.  The cable stop was/is parallel to the derailleur barrel, which forces a long length of housing in order to maintain your minimum bend radius, but even at length the housing actively fought against the derailleur's rotation, and in my estimation all that force got translated to barrel rotation.    I mean I could repeatedly make the barrel walk clockwise by manually moving the derailleur."

If it needs more adjustment it's because there is something going on with the cables/shifters.  If everything else is equal, a bike with a Tiagra rear derailleur won't need more adjustment than a bike with a 105 or Ultegra rear derailleur.  After changing the cables I usually have to adjust then a little later on due to ""cable stretch"" (the housings, end caps and cables setting, not so much the cable actually stretching). After that it's just set and forget, I don't need to touch the tiagra derailleur ever again."

Would make a difference on a DH or AM MTB, or a track bike that'll get abused. Stick with 3 cross, minimal benefit going 4 cross. With 6800 Hubs to H+Sons SL42's, I get 274 for the front, 274 on non-drive rear, 272 on drive-side rear. These are rounded to nearest spoke length you can order. Always round up to the even whole number if the spoke calc spits out xx0.8 or above, round down if below xx0.8. So if it's 272.8, round up to 274 and if 270.7 round down to 270. Now, cause it's your first build, I'd suggest sticking with non-bladed spokes, DT Champs or Comps. Just easier to work with. If you don't have a truing stand and tension meter or haven't tru-ed wheels before, don't attempt to tension the wheel, give it to someone with experience to do this."

bikewrench,37exc6,cleansoap,3,Wed May 27 03:43:03 2015 UTC,"Well, you're getting some bad answers here.  First off, /r/wheelbuild is a better place to ask, as was mentioned.  I am also doubting some of your build specs.  There's little point to bladed spokes if you're running 36 spokes aside from visually helping you counter spoke windup, and for a messenger 105 hubs are mechanically identical to Ultegra, I believe, but cost 1/2 or 2/3 as much for probably just another 50-100g.  The SL42 is also probably unnecessary even for a messenger and is pretty costly for a first build; some basic Kinlins are the usual recommendation for a first build (or really, for many successive builds) and are quite high quality at half the price or less.  I would suggest that you read this and then kind of reassess your build and any questions around it.  Building a bicycle wheel is very much doable, and everyone starts somewhere, but you need to have a thorough grasp on the physics and actually understand the physics of what is going on.  A lot of people use BS stress-relieving methods, for example, because they don't understand the physics behind the wheel."
bikewrench,37exc6,illustribox,1 point,Wed May 27 18:44:34 2015 UTC,Dropping 144 bladed spokes will more than pay for the tensionometer (or however you spell it).
bikewrench,37exc6,illustribox,1 point,Wed May 27 23:15:43 2015 UTC,"Yep, the cost difference between 144 bladed spokes and 144 non-bladed spokes is enough to build a third wheelset of quite high quality."
bikewrench,37exc6,illustribox,1 point,Wed May 27 23:19:33 2015 UTC,"Alright, read through most of that (awesome resource by the way, thanks)...  So the 3 cross 36 is going to be plenty, good to know. I'm not really dissuaded from the bladed spokes now because of the availability of the locking brass nipples that I had overlooked before; I also have spray on plasti dip for the threads as well.  As for the lengths, the guide didn't get much more exact than the +/- 1mm tolerance I've seen elsewhere, though it's making me lean slightly towards the longer and having the builder grind them for me.  As for the Ultegra over 105, I'm getting a fairly sizable discount from my mentor on the groupsets to the point that my own 172.5 52/36+11-32 groupset with the GS dérailleur is coming out to only about ~$70 more than the equivalent 105 set, so I figured I'd just keep a little vanity and have the hubs match.  And for the SL42s; I'm still considering the Archetype or its anodized variant as well; I'm just partial to the aeros myself for both aesthetics and the amount of resistance I encounter in certain parts of the city on the job.  Anyway, your input is greatly appreciated and I just wanted to assure you, again, I'll just be learning all of this alongside someone much more experienced and well equipped, I just hate stopping him every few minutes to ask minute details (he gets distracted just as easily as I do)"
bikewrench,37exc6,MinimusNadir,3,Thu May 28 01:27:35 2015 UTC,"Awesome.  It's the standard text for wheel building.  Yeah, not sure if 4x would even work given how deep the rim is and that if I recall Shimano uses pretty high hub flanges.  Maybe I misinterpret, but what does the bladed spoke thing have to do with the nipples there?  The spoke windup thing I mentioned and which is in the text is an issue while building.  The loosening problem is something that occurs largely whenever the wheel is not properly stress relieved or whenever for whatever reason a spoke completely unloads at some point during the cycle.  Butted spokes (or bladed, really) allow more elongation and improve the wheel's durability by raising the threshold for complete unloading of spokes.  And I've never really heard of anyone using plastidip.  There are two schools of thought when it comes to what to use on nipples.  Always use grease or some sort of anti-seize or similar where the nipple seats itself in the rim, but on the threads there are two schools of thought, one which believes in lubrication and one that believes in immobilizing the threads.  Of the latter camp, which plastidip would fall into (though I don't know much about it, it may be too thick), linseed oil (boiled?) is common and effective since it allows you to turn the nipples without resistance while building the wheel but dries nicely after.  I've always fallen into the lubrication and anti-corrosion camp and it has served me just fine.  If you're within a 2mm range, just pick whatever spoke length is in that range, that usually works fine.  It is sometimes a good idea to get the rim and hubs, do an actual measurement, and then buy the stuff (perhaps from a shop) if you want to reduce risk on your part.  The grinding thing is only applicable to prevent puncturing the tube in single wall rims.  The issue you're contending with is bottoming out the threads on the spoke.  That's reasonable, and you definitely can't go wrong with either one.  The archetype may well be more aerodynamic than the 42s.  At those still-fairly-low depths, the bigger issue is likely the interface of the tire with the brake track, for which the H+Son Archetype, Kinlin XC-279/XR31T/XR22T, or DT R460 (among the budget options) have a significant advantage over the SL42.  Hell, at that price point the FLO 30 rims are in your price range.  If there's even a quite small crosswind (which there usually is) the SL42s will suffer from very early turbulent separation off the tire, which will completely invalidate the rim's depth.  But any of these aren't going to change stuff drastically.  But of course the aesthetics issue is definitely personal choice.  If you like the old school thing, the H+Son TB14 is supposedly really good and has a nice wide profile.  Of course.  Feel free to ask whatever else comes to mind, and it's good to have a mentor.  Just make sure to think about the physics in that text, even experienced wheelbuilders don't always understand the physics, and I've seen a lot of long time wheelbuilders do stuff like stress-relieving wrong as a result, thinking that methods that cause popping are achieving the desired result when really they are simply causing some movement at the elbow and nipples."

Luckily, you may not need to.  It takes time for your pads to bed in, there's a good chance that you'll get more braking power over the next week or two.  If you have metal pads, it takes longer than with fiber.  Go out, ride, and give them some time, they should definitely get better.  Also, with any mechanical brakes, make sure you don't have a ton of extra cable."

The fork you have will probably flex and shudder under that kind of load enough to offset any benefit you'd get from such strong braking power.  There's a reason the newer road disc stuff is trending towards 140, and it's not just aesthetics.  Being able to generate more power isn't necessarily a good thing - you say you want it because you ride in traffic, well.. I ride rim brakes, cross cantilevers, 140/160 mm cx discs in traffic too, and I can say that too much braking is a bad thing.  The last thing you want is to lock up your wheel and lose traction, because then you wind up with even greater stopping distances.  I would say, bed in your rotors/pads more, and get used to the feel before looking to change anything out.  There's no such thing as magic stop power, basic physics tell us that much."

Think of organic pads as a pad of cork and semi-metallic/sintered as a block of iron.  Not true, but it helps to visualize the tradeoffs.  Organic are softer, grip the rotor better, and are quieter.  They also wear faster, foul more easily, and do a worse job of pulling heat from the rotor (that's a plus and a minus on hydraulic systems, probably only a minus on cable systems)."

Are these not the case?   This is dependent on a LOT of things, most notably chain stay length and derailleur cage shape. But in my experience a triple setup has rubbing in each ring. While the chain line of a a triple crank isn't that far off a modern road double, but again a lot depends on the model of FD, the tooth combo of the crank (some FDs are designed for a 52/42/30, others a 52/39/30, and some more 52/42/32. The arc of the derailleur is specific to each crank.  Anyway, while it is, in theory, possible to have a rub-free middle ring, this is more often than not very difficult to achieve due to the geometry of the bike and the shape of the FD cage. Especially if you're getting rubbing on BOTH sides."

My friend's bike has a bent large chainring, and the chain is worn to .75%, which might mean new chainrings and cogs. The chainring is aluminum, and I'm not sure it can be straightened - it's severe enough the chain comes off on part of the rotation. This is the bike with a rim that was eaten by a misaligned brake, so it needs a new rear rim too… if I could build wheels I would replace just the rim for her, but I don't know how, and it would be more expensive for a shop to do that work than to just replace the wheel.

bikewrench,37dubx,PeanutbutterSamich,2,Wed May 27 00:25:59 2015 UTC,"Yep thats your problem. Cross chaining is when you use the outside ring on the front and the inner most cog in the back or vise versa, it causes the chain to go at an angle between the chainring & cogs. this not only causes it to rub on the derailuer as you are experiencing (it can be some what alleviated with the trim function on some shifter) and will cause the chain and the chainring/cogs to wear faster, the teeth on the chainring/cogs are straight and the crossed chain is coming in at an angle = bad times  picture of what cross chaining is"
bikewrench,37dubx,PeanutbutterSamich,-2,Wed May 27 00:34:32 2015 UTC,"This is NOT cross chaining. When only the MIDDLE chainring is used, the extreme low and extreme high rear cogs cause the chain to rub on the front derailleur cage.

bikewrench,37dqgk,-Miyata,3,Wed May 27 06:09:09 2015 UTC,"Look ok, replace those pads though.  Get some steel wool and clean up that braking surface and see if there are any gouges hiding under all that gunk."
bikewrench,37cyr9,synrgi,2,Tue May 26 18:46:42 2015 UTC,"Things you will want to check will include wheel hubs and bearings (may need new bearings/cones and grease; if the cups are damaged new wheels are easier), tyres (possibly cracked/worn if they are as old as the bike), headset and bearings (may be worn/sticky; you don't want your headset to fail), BB + pedals as mentioned, chainrings (for wear on teeth), derailleurs, brakes, seat tube (check it's not seized into the frame). A few other little jobs here and there.   If your chain's snapped I'd be concerned about the state of your chain rings and cassette (or freewheel on a bike this age) as they will have been put under a lot of stress from running with a worn or otherwise damaged chain. Worth replacing in any case. Check your derailleur jockey wheels also.  It's essentially a top-to-bottom job - although you may find there's not a huge amount wrong. Best websites that I use regularly are Sheldon Brown - which is an excellent resource and ridiculously thorough, and Park Tool. Lots of videos on Youtube for individual jobs. If you want to get a book or two, Zinn and the Art of Road Bike Maintenance is very good, or (possibly UK-only) the Haynes Bike Book is good if less in-depth.  Good luck, let's see some before and after pics! I hope it doesn't get too expensive for you. If you have a bike co-op or similar nearby scout them out for used parts in good condition and helpful advice."

Like I said I didn't see any immediate issues with any bearings anywhere but I figure at a minimum I'll have to unload, clean, and repack everything. I'm hoping the chain snapped just due to the fact of age but I guess I'll figure that out as I work."

Check this guy out: https://www.youtube.com/user/shyflirt1 ""RJ The Bike Guy"" he had a video for almost everything I needed to see. He has a video on vintage bike to fixie conversion, which was good to watch the dis-assembly and learn all the part names. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sInijI1vr34  I think I might make such a checklist too, there's probably a lot of people who would have a go at it if they knew where to start."

High quality, and certainly more durable than any top end cassette today (because of its width and all steel cogs).  You're probably changing the chain too, right? There are zillions of 13 and 14/28 7 speed ones out there. Your derailleur can handle it if you size the chain right.  Downtube shifters? You could probably put them in friction mode and use a 6s.

bikewrench,37c00q,mountainslayer,1 point,Tue May 26 19:07:25 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about that, treat it like a SS wheel. Straighten it out and bolt it down. The only thing that matters as far as axle placement on the dropout goes is on the drive side. Pull the wheel all the way back on the DS. Snug the bolt a lil, straighten the wheel and then crank it down"
bikewrench,37c00q,chappy72,1 point,Tue May 26 19:53:03 2015 UTC,"I solved this problem by installing another one of those hangers on the left side dropout.

Taking another look at the bike specs, it seems as though it is already fitted with a Shimano Press-Fit BB despite the FSA cranks.

bikewrench,37azdn,nomannersman,1 point,Tue May 26 09:55:50 2015 UTC,"Chalk it up to inexperience! I had my chain replaced just before a 2-day 190-mile ride around London, and spent the next two days fighting against mechanical failures - chain falling off, struggle changing gears etc.  The en-route support team showed me that a bent chainring tooth was lifting my chain off of the ring with each rotation of the cranks. Not sure of exactly how to go about fixing the issue, I decided to replace the entire crankset and casette!  In the end, parts + tools to replace existing have ended up costing more than it was worth. At least I'm learning something.  Edit: Decided to also replace the casette as they are not expensive and I was told that worn parts can cause extra wear on new parts."

bikewrench,37azdn,nomannersman,1 point,Wed May 27 06:28:51 2015 UTC,Someone weighed out the new 105 crank at 740 g. So it's a little lighter but the real difference is in build quality. The fsa crank pales in comparison to the 105 crank.
bikewrench,37aued,Kro-Magnon,7,Tue May 26 06:58:21 2015 UTC,Did you use grease?  Bolts need grease to get tight.  You can't just muscle them in.  They'll strip before they get tight without grease.  You use some grease and try to get stuff reasonable tight.  Firm but not doing anything special with the tool to try to make it tighter.  If you need grease you can get it at any bike shop or auto parts store.  Hardware stores too.  I like marine grease if you're at a place that doesn't sell bicycle-specific stuff.  Some bolts do well with blue Loctite but you can learn about that when you've got a part that just won't stop creaking.  Don't worry about that for now.
bikewrench,37aued,SavingHawaii,3,Tue May 26 07:06:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm, sounds odd. I suggest taking it to a bike shop for proper tightening. They'll know better."
bikewrench,37aued,802bikeguy_com,2,Tue May 26 06:59:33 2015 UTC,"Grease is key, and crank arm bolts really need a lot of force.  if the crank arms were loose, the metal where the arms meet the bb spindle (only thing you don't grease) may have deformed, and once that happens the arms will keep coming loose / need to be replaced."
bikewrench,37aued,dialectric,2,Tue May 26 08:22:31 2015 UTC,There should be a thin layer of grease on a square taper spindle. Here's one discussion worth reading. I also use a torque wrench to make sure I get the bolts tight enough.

bikewrench,379sph,dearoldavy,15,Tue May 26 01:05:47 2015 UTC,"People make one massive error in choosing compact vs. standard cranksets I've noticed, and that's in trying to decide if they need X low or Y high gear or not.  What's even more important is how you spend most of your time riding.  For almost everyone, a compact will allow you more distribution of your cassette while doing the riding you do most of the time.  I see lots of tough guys on standards with worn out big cogs (incidentally, the ones made out of weaker metals on the higher end cassettes for weight savings!) because they only use the top 4 for 90% of their riding.  In addition to that, they are are cross chaining more to stay in the big ring.  Most people should ride a compact.  If you need a standard, you know why you need one (TT usage or you're a great sprinter), or, you're lying to yourself about it and no one is going to change your mind anyway, or it's some macho thing with the same net result."
bikewrench,379sph,conipto,3,Tue May 26 03:49:13 2015 UTC,I'd never heard of bigger cogs being made of a different grade steel on some cassettes. Can you elaborate on that at all? Like which ones and what types of steel?
bikewrench,379sph,arguably_pizza,8,Tue May 26 04:56:47 2015 UTC,"Example. The colour changes as the cogs get bigger. Smaller ones are steel, larger are titanium, which wears much faster. Shimano and Campagnolo do this on their top end cassettes."

bikewrench,379sph,kabas,6,Tue May 26 01:46:18 2015 UTC,"compact crank is best crank.  i bet you struggle up hills and never spin-out at 60+km/h.  therefore, get a compact."
bikewrench,379sph,Sumpm,3,Tue May 26 09:17:37 2015 UTC,"Put it this way:  you can find a 52 or 53T chainring if you need more top-end on your compact, but you can't go smaller than a 38T on a standard.  Compacts will always give you more range than a standard, and they also keep you from having to run a huge cassette (a 39x27 is equivalent to a 34x23) if you don't have huge hills around."
bikewrench,379sph,dayfroind,1 point,Tue May 26 09:39:04 2015 UTC,I have a standard but have been riding my cx bike a lot more lately; instant realization that I need a compact on my road bike.

If you have a standard, an 11/32 cassette on a standard double gives you almost the same granny gear as a 28 tooth with a compact.  If you can spin out a compact on anything other than a very steep or very sustained descent you're a monster - and I'm jealous.  Personally - cat 4 racer, I find a compact gives me a more useable range, otherwise the bottom half of the cassette is reserved for ""downhill only"" in the big ring."

bikewrench,378xsh,_okra,1 point,Mon May 25 21:44:05 2015 UTC,Same here- works quite well.  One thing to consider is that the minimum largest cog with an X9 is a 28t- so you'll need an 11-28 or bigger.
bikewrench,378xsh,horsebacon,2,Tue May 26 00:35:52 2015 UTC,"Uhm, why?  I had no problems with 11-23 and a 40T wolftooth in this exact setup described..  I'm not saying you're wrong, just curious as to why you'd say that.  The cage lenght of the X9 would make the maximum tooth count matter, but minimum it'd just take up more slack as if it were in a higher gear, right?"
bikewrench,378xsh,conipto,2,Tue May 26 04:35:19 2015 UTC,"It's the published minimum according to SRAM, based I assume on maintaining the correct chain gap for good chain-cog engagement. Of course you can run a smaller max cog, but you'll get much faster cassette wear due to less chain wrap. The ... whatever you call the part that attaches to the hanger is longer than a road RD (to clear the larger cassette), and with a road cassette it's too big of a gap.  Basically the same problem that a lot of the 40t and 42t cassette conversions have, where they max out the tension screw or substitute an even longer one to get over the big cog- it produces a bigger gap than normal, in this case due to the bigger lowest cog, in your case due to an overall smaller cassette. It ""works"" until you kill cassettes and chains way faster than normal b/c the chain is engaging fewer teeth."
bikewrench,378xsh,horsebacon,1 point,Tue May 26 20:24:35 2015 UTC,"oh shit, that's good to know! i put the x9 on my bike after this last cx season ended (along with an 11-36 for toolin around) but the cassette i raced on was an 11-25, sooooo looks like i'll need a new cassette come september. thank you!"

I looked into other options and they seemed sub par versus just doing the whole job. One issue I am about to face is the distance between the drop outs - currently 126mm - which I need to be 130mm.

I have only basic maintenance knowledge so I'd probably need to pay a shop to do this for me. I'm guessing by the time I pay for parts/labor I'd be pretty close to the price of a new bike.   Last time I was in the shop to replace my wheels a year ago they were asking me how attached I was to my bike and I wasn't sure if they were just trying to sell me a new bike or be realistic with me.

I'm choosing not to do that because I really like the frame I've got (Reynolds 531 double butted on a 1994 Dawes Impulse), it's very light and quite robust. I also want a steel frame because I'm going to start touring and the flex that steel allows will provide a more comfortable ride on those long distances. I'm also very keen to undergo the work myself to expand my knowledge of bike maintenance and repair.   Is there anything that makes you want to keep your current frame? If you are unable to do the work yourself it will inflate the cost of doing it through your LBS. I would recommend trying a few bikes and seeing how they feel versus your current one."
bikewrench,379y1m,UkeOverThere,1 point,Tue May 26 19:34:05 2015 UTC,"Nothing really ties me to my bike, just cost. Up until now it's been cheaper to maintain than to replace. I've put around 25,000 miles on it over the past 5 years and if I can be honest when I first started out I had no idea how to maintain bikes. I've ridden it year around, rain, snow, hail and all. As a consequence of my zero maintenance knowledge at the beginning of my bike commuting a lot of the parts got beaten up more than they should have(not cleaning, lubricating, etc). I've just been trying to maintain it as best as possible ever since.   I no doubt would enjoy a new bike for commuting. I bought a supersix evo last year that I've put over 10,000 miles on for training/racing. I've taken much better care with the supersix and I can recognize the value of a well maintained bike now. It does sound like the new bike route will be cheaper. I do like the idea of building up a bike at some point but I don't think I'm quite ready for that yet. Thanks for the input btw!"
bikewrench,379y1m,redeux,2,Tue May 26 20:00:39 2015 UTC,No problem! There's no reason why you couldn't learn to build a bike on your own. I had very little knowledge until about 4 months ago. I've watched loads of videos on YouTube outlining numerous different modifications and upgrades and now I feel like I can do it all myself. Once the parts arrive I suppose I'll find out!
bikewrench,379y1m,UkeOverThere,2,Tue May 26 20:17:33 2015 UTC,"Paying a shop for the upgrades could exceed the bike's value significantly. If you have a bike co-op in your area, you could work on it there more cheaply and learn the process. If you don't have a co-op and your primary use is commuting, buying a good condition used bike is another option."

bikewrench,379y1m,dialectric,-4,Tue May 26 03:25:31 2015 UTC,"It's a hefty price for very little gain. 10, or 9 speed parts will be cheaper if you really think you need more gear selection in the rear."
bikewrench,379y1m,-Miyata,1 point,Tue May 26 04:27:08 2015 UTC,"You'd still need new shifters, chainrings, chain, cassette and new wheels or rebuild the rearwheel with a new hub,... The frame should have the right spacing for the wider rear hub too.  I don't think it'd be worth it to go to 9 or 10 speed. You'd still need to replace just about everything. Unless you get a crazy deal on somebody's old groupset + wheels I think you are better off buying a ""new"" used bike. (By ""new"" I mean an extra bike.)"
bikewrench,3783ss,unfunfionn,5,Mon May 25 17:30:41 2015 UTC,"As a rule of thumb you will use big ring with the 6 smaller cogs and small ring with the 6 biggers cogs. This will give you all the gearing necessary.  If the front derailleur is being grinded by the chain on the inside while on the small ring, it means you need to adjust your stopper screw on the derailleur or release some cable tension. If thats happening on the big ring, you need some extra cable tension or an adjustment on the other stopper screw on the derailleur.  You have the following setups for front derailleur:  Two screws that limit the max and min range of the derailleur respectively. Cable tension. Derailleur height(check sheldon brown) and angle(should be parallel to the chainrings)"
bikewrench,3783ss,rayEW,1 point,Mon May 25 17:47:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you (likewise /u/artificialape). I fixed it by adjusting the limit screw on the inside. No more grinding anywhere now.  However, now the front gear requires two pushes on the shifters to go up or down properly. If I press once, the derailleur moves a bit without shifting, but rubs against the chain. Am I looking at cable tension or the limit screws to fix this?"
bikewrench,3783ss,cleansoap,5,Mon May 25 18:11:38 2015 UTC,"That middle position is the ""trim"" position to which /u/artificialape refered to.  You trim the FD to shift the cage slightly to prevent rub when crossed.    You should not require two pushes of the shifter to shift gears, however, you should be able to move the FD both clicks in one long push.  In fact many people have difficulty finding the trim position because they push too hard (right past the trim position) whereas it sounds like you're not pushing hard enough."
bikewrench,3783ss,rayEW,2,Mon May 25 18:27:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but to adjust my front derailleur I did the following. First of all, I will assume your derailleur is mounted on the correct height and angle.  1 - Give full range to both stopper screws.  2 - Adjust cable tension, where your gears shift correctly. Sometimes the chain will fallout on the outside during the shifting motion, at this point its ok. Your cable tension is what should position the derailleur when you're on the big ring, that's your focus. You should not over-tension the derailleur and limit it on the stopper screw.  3 - After thats done, you adjust the limit screws, they will decrease your max range during shifting. It's important to notice that DURING shifting, your derailleur will go beyond the range of when you're not shifting. That's the movement you will want to limit not to throw your chain to the outside. After shifting you should have a little range of motion if you pull the cable with your hand.   4 - The small ring is easier, adjust the limit screw so it doesnt drop the chain on the inside or rubs the chain on your lowest gear combination. The derailleur has a spring on it, the tension of that is something you leave shimano to worry about. If you limit the stopper screw too much, the chain simply won't go down, so you have to give it more play."
bikewrench,3783ss,rayEW,1 point,Mon May 25 18:57:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I've gotten everything shifting properly now, no rubbing. Cable tension isn't okay though. When I shift downwards, it happens with a very aggressive 'clunk'. I set cable tension when I was aligning the small chainring, and I set it tight (as everywhere seems to be advising). Now it's playing like a bass guitar string, but the barrel adjusters aren't helping."
bikewrench,3783ss,artificialape,2,Mon May 25 20:15:11 2015 UTC,"I don't own a 105 groupset, but if nothing is rubbing, shifting is working good... I wouldn't mind the clunk. My A070 tourney front shifter works with quite a clunk on the front downshift, and it's how my LBS set it up for me.  The spring on the derailleur is the one responsible for pushing the chain to the inside, when you shift into the small chainring. I worry with cable tension when setting up the big chainring, that's where the tension must be fine tuned. If you have too much tension there, you will break stuff and will be forced to use the stopper screws aggressively."
bikewrench,3783ss,cleansoap,1 point,Mon May 25 20:46:33 2015 UTC,"I think I learned more today than I actually did good to my bike. But the tension seems comparable to the back gears, and it shifts. There's some occasional rubbing I can't get rid of (big front gear, small back gear). But the place I ordered from has a physical store and I'd expect a proper set-up on a week-old bike to be free, so I'll try that.  Anyway, thanks for the help!"
bikewrench,3783ss,nhluhr,10,Mon May 25 21:32:54 2015 UTC,"This is called 'cross-chaining' and isn't really something to be tweaked out.   The front shifter has three positions, one of which, the 'trim', is sort of between the two cogs and can help with rubbing at the extremes.   http://www.bicyclechainrings.com/crosschaining.html"

bikewrench,379jra,hurricanejosh,2,Tue May 26 01:51:08 2015 UTC,"The pull ratio for Sram and Shimano front derailleurs are the same except for the new Yaw stuff. Sram will not release exactly what the different ratio is. I can't say for sure for your exact question although I and have called SRAM on similar issues before.  The consensus seems to be many things work well but are not recommended. If your Red 22 shifters are pre Yaw then they work very well with a Ultegra front derailleur. This is what I am running, and it works great. I have not setup Red 22 Yaw shifters with a Shimano front derailleur but have setup a Yaw front derailleur without a Yaw shifter and it worked well.  I'd personally give it a shot."

bikewrench,378x9x,ergergroid,2,Tue May 26 02:28:36 2015 UTC,"Hairspray sounds like a terrible idea, especially considering that it's normally used to hold things in place.  Pick up some WD-40. If something needs loosening, that's the best thing around. You don't need to be concerned about getting it inside components or anywhere really. WD-40 stands for Water Displacement 40 - it's the 40th formula the scientists came up with to displace water and they found it had ideal properties for rust prevention/removal and was great as a multi purpose lubricant."

bikewrench,376qiy,cleansoap,2,Mon May 25 11:09:49 2015 UTC,Tektro Oryx cantilevers. I don't think that should be a problem - am I right? Done a bit of research and it looks like something like a Dia Compe Tech 77 lever should work. I have access to second-hand bits at my local bike co-op as well so hopefully shouldn't need to break the bank.  Front mech is likely to work OK then?  Cheers for your info - hadn't thought about the brakes to be honest.
bikewrench,376qiy,cleansoap,2,Mon May 25 12:15:43 2015 UTC,Cantis are road pull ratio.  Flar bar brake levers are going to default to MTB pull ratio.  Since you have studs consider V-brakes.

bikewrench,3755v4,conipto,5,Sun May 24 23:45:21 2015 UTC,"so.. to the far right of your picture is an example of what I would suspect.. rim tape causing the tire not to seat into the bead hook correctly.  If it rides up onto the edge you can sometimes lose the tire once inflated.  You should be able to mount as normal, and go up to say, 50 psi, then make sure it's perfectly EVENLY seated around the tube.  Usually there's a seam in the sidewall just above the rim of the wheel that makes a good guide for checking.  If you notice this seam particularly high in that spot, that tells you it's going to come off once inflated.  if particularly low, it could be binding up on something else (i.e., a crushed bead, bead hook)"

Some rims just aren't great with some tapes, some tires, etc.    At this point if you've blown 5 tubes and bought rim tape, might be time to just suck it up and go to a shop.

bikewrench,375h68,TheBicyclist,1 point,Mon May 25 02:15:36 2015 UTC,"Hozan once made a tool for just this job, a metal shift about the length of a crank arm with two strong hooks and a high tensile bolt.   You placed the bolt over the spindle,  just like the ram on a crank puller,  slipped the hooks around the crank arm and screwed in the bolt to pull off the crank.   It worked pretty well,  and I've been meaning to make one for far to long,  if you've got access to a drill press and some taps knocking one up will be quite easy"

bikewrench,375h68,occupint,2,Tue May 26 02:06:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they stopped making these a long time ago, so long ago I could be wrong about who made it.   Worked week though,  from memory the front hook was adjustable in length allow for the angle at which the crank ran away from the BB. You could adjust it so the bolt was always parallel to the BB spind"
bikewrench,375gsi,nhmegan,5,Mon May 25 01:21:25 2015 UTC,"Easiest and cheapest way is to replace the smaller chain ring with an even smaller one.  Whether you can do that depends on the BCD of the crank.  Next easiest would be a cassette with larger top cogs, which would probably require a longer chain as well, and might require a new derailleur.    If you do replace the cassette and derailleur, you might want to take the opportunity to replace the shifter as well, and get more gears, but that depends on various factors, such as if you can find just one shifter, if that shifter will more or less match the other, whether you want to replace both to get matching, etc..  More gears won't buy you any larger of a cog, just finer steps between gears.  May or may not be of any benefit.  You can do both the chain ring and the larger cassette if one is not enough.  If those don't work, then look at replacing the cranks to a newer set with a smaller BCD for an even smaller chain ring."
bikewrench,375gsi,MinimusNadir,1 point,Mon May 25 01:27:03 2015 UTC,what about getting the ultegra triple crankset and triple-left shifter? Does that require new cabling and such?
bikewrench,375gsi,D0rk4L,2,Mon May 25 02:01:47 2015 UTC,"It's an option, but you will probably need more than that so it's by far the most expensive option. You'll want a triple front derailleur and a long cage rear derailleur to control all that new chain slack, plus a new chain. And as a rule of thumb I would always change cables and housing in that situation unless the existing stuff was basically brand new. Old cables will have a negative effect on shifting quality."
bikewrench,375gsi,MinimusNadir,1 point,Mon May 25 02:28:30 2015 UTC,"Some front derailleurs have pulled from the bottom, some from the top, so pay attention to where your cabling runs.  You might still be able to work things out easily even if you want to switch pull directions, various adapters are available.  Also, the cables themselves are probably the cheapest part of the entire endeavor.  Yeah, going 3x would definitely work, provided the small ring was sufficiently small for you.  Depending on how the new crank is set up, you may also need to change your bottom bracket out to get the fronts and rears to line up best.  If you do that, depending on how small the front chain ring is and what your current derailleur is like, you might need to buy a derailleur with a longer cage, in order to take up the extra slack created by going to a significantly smaller front chain ring."
bikewrench,375gsi,thedugong,2,Mon May 25 03:00:22 2015 UTC,Cheapest would be a MTB 9spd cassette and rear derailleur.

bikewrench,375egi,SavingHawaii,1 point,Mon May 25 02:57:00 2015 UTC,"If it is a steel fork the tool you need is a Park FCG-1.  I'm not sure if it is still produced but older shops should have one, I know we do.  Check around.  If you remove the fork before bringing it to the shop the repair shouldn't cost too much.  You may also need to straighten the dropouts if they too are bent."
bikewrench,374l89,fishdeer,2,Sun May 24 20:44:30 2015 UTC,"http://si.shimano.com/php/download.php?file=pdf/ev/EV-RD-5700-3042A.pdf  If I'm understanding you correctly you're saying that the plate that part 2 in assembly 1 screws into is able to pivot without resistance?  If so the spring in assembly 1 is most likely broken (could be out of one of its holes, but likely broken (unless you've disassembled it in the past)).  The B-screw loads that spring, which allows the derailleur body to pivot but not flop around as yours appears to be doing."
bikewrench,374l89,cleansoap,2,Sun May 24 21:18:43 2015 UTC,This is 100% accurate. Is this a derailleur death sentence?
bikewrench,374l89,cleansoap,2,Sun May 24 21:28:28 2015 UTC,Depends on part availability and how much you value your time.  Someone who works in a bike shop would need to chime in on what the availability of assembly 1 is for your generation of 105.
bikewrench,374l89,ergergroid,2,Sun May 24 21:56:17 2015 UTC,"This is something you would need to harvest out of another derailleur if the spring is actually broken. A service-focused bike shop may have one in a parts bin or something, but you probably won't have any luck getting a new spring."
bikewrench,374l89,giantnegro,1 point,Sun May 24 22:08:11 2015 UTC,"Edit: Nevermind. Sounds like you've got a problem if the thing the b limit hits is also moving.  RDs are supposed to rotate. Adjust the B limit screw to keep it from rotating too much. At least, that sounds like your RD problem."
bikewrench,374gdi,questions_fo_days,1 point,Sun May 24 20:03:28 2015 UTC,"Yes.    Your bike has a square taper bottom bracket which means, in 2014, that it has an ISO/English/British threaded bottom bracket shell.  However your bike claims a 68mm wide shell and that crankset almost undoubtedly has a spindle intended for a 73mm wide shell.  It should therefore come with 2 optional (but not optional for you!) 2.5mm spacers, one for each side."
bikewrench,374gdi,cleansoap,2,Sun May 24 20:12:47 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks for the response.  I do see where the compatibility is for a 68/73mm and in the pic of the bottom bracket it even shows a guide about using the spacers.  Thanks again.  I'm going to go ahead and order it.
bikewrench,374gdi,vaginapizza,2,Sun May 24 20:18:03 2015 UTC,"You actually need three spacers, two on the drive side, and one on the non-drive side."

bikewrench,373t23,802bikeguy_com,3,Sun May 24 16:50:14 2015 UTC,"I know we often talk about the amount of wiggle room which exists in Shimano max-cog specs on their rear derailleur, but that bike ships with a 32T cog, and 4600 is not specced for one that large."
bikewrench,373t23,cleansoap,2,Sun May 24 17:34:10 2015 UTC,OP could source non dynasis mtb derailer. An older 9 speed xt or slx would be sweet.
bikewrench,373t23,802bikeguy_com,1 point,Sun May 24 18:38:39 2015 UTC,"Tiagra 4601 and it says max size 32T?  Also, yeah, I'm running the standard 11-32, 34-50.    Also, can you run a 10 speed RD on a 9 speed cassette?  I'd consider using a smaller cassette, but I'm relatively new and my climbing power is shit."
bikewrench,373t23,cleansoap,3,Sun May 24 18:55:42 2015 UTC,"Then go for it.  The shimano tech-doc I pulled for RD-4600 said 30 (which probably would be ok), but if they're claiming 32 then there is no caveats.  And, yes, 10 speed road works just fine on 9 speed road."
bikewrench,373t23,VoIPQuake,1 point,Sun May 24 19:00:58 2015 UTC,"From what I gather of my amateur reading, there are 4600 SS & GS variants, of which the GS supports a 32T.    Is it possible to upgrade a 9spd to a 10spd cassette?"
bikewrench,373t23,cleansoap,1 point,Sun May 24 19:06:09 2015 UTC,Its possible but you would need a new lever and chain.
bikewrench,373t23,cromulenticular,1 point,Sun May 24 19:40:14 2015 UTC,"Is it possible to upgrade a 9spd to a 10spd cassette?   Sure.  Any freehub which can hold a Shimano/SRAM 9 speed cassette can hold a 10 speed on.  The issue is that all the ""brains"" for shifting are in the shifter, not the rear derailleur, so your 9 speed shifters will not be able to index a 10 speed cassette."
bikewrench,373t23,cleansoap,1 point,Sun May 24 20:04:41 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.  So basically I'd need to upgrade one of my sti shifters to a 10 spd compatible one,  upgrade my cassette to 10, and replace the RD.  Damn.    Maybe I'll just stick with the 105 RD."
bikewrench,373t23,cleansoap,2,Sun May 24 20:21:37 2015 UTC,"Stay with 9 speed, there is nothing wrong with 9 speed.    That said, if you upgrade to 10 speed and want to get rid of your 9-speed gear, message me and I'll gladly take it :)"
bikewrench,373t23,kinboyatuwo,1 point,Sun May 24 23:43:48 2015 UTC,"You don't actually need to replace the RD to go to 10 speed.  You do, however, need to replace the chain.  But, regardless, don't do it.  In this modern era of integrated shifters changing the number of speeds is not worth it.  For you'll spend a significant chunk of the cost of a full 11 speed 5800 groupset just in a new shifter, cassette and chain.  Modern shifters are stupid expensive and rarely worth upgrading outside of whole groupsets.  (at least not with new parts)"
bikewrench,373t23,cromulenticular,1 point,Sun May 24 20:23:10 2015 UTC,"Well the RD is already trashed, so that's a given.  So in reality, I'll just replace the RD with a 105 and call it a day.  It isn't terribly expensive.  I really appreciate the help."
bikewrench,373t23,cromulenticular,1 point,Sun May 24 20:28:43 2015 UTC,"If 105 you must go 5700 or earlier.  5800 is 11-speed 105 and 11 speed Shimano road is on a different cable pull ratio than previous, and so won't index on your setup."
bikewrench,373ryz,happy_otter,4,Sun May 24 16:38:32 2015 UTC,"Repatch it.   Remember, with vulcanizing fluid, you want to let it dry before you apply the patch. Don't blow on it. It takes like 3 minutes anyways.  Rip off the old patch and clean it up with sand paper. Apply fluid in wide but thin layer. LET DRY. Apply patch, let it fuse for a few minutes. Install it before inflating it. The pressure of tube to tire will help hold it.  EDIT: Your tube is probably fine. I've got tubes with like 9 patches on them, in different spots. My problem was a crappy tire that picked up every piece of glass and thorn possible. Upgraded to more durable tires and had no flats besides pinch (My own fault)."
bikewrench,373ryz,qsceszxdwa,2,Sun May 24 16:58:11 2015 UTC,"Okay I wasn't sure you could rip patches off, and I thought patching on top of the old patch would be a terrible idea. I'll repatch it then, thanks for the tips. This tube has about 5 patches on it, I think.... :D  Edit: how do you rip a patch off? Good fingernails?"
bikewrench,373ryz,qsceszxdwa,3,Sun May 24 17:19:03 2015 UTC,Start from the edge bubble and work your way around it. Or poke the main bubble and pull it off. Or patch over it as if it's part of the tube.
bikewrench,373ryz,cleansoap,3,Sun May 24 18:11:24 2015 UTC,"The bulge is where the patch isn't adhered to the tube and so a blister of air is formed in the space between the outer surface of the tube and the inner surface of the patch.  This is typical of a tube which is inflated too soon after patching or a patch too soon after fluid application.  The edges set firm, but not the middle."
bikewrench,373ryz,cleansoap,1 point,Sun May 24 17:44:25 2015 UTC,"I ripped the patch off now (found out heat works best) and that particular puncture was a very nasty gash. There's no adherence to the tube because basically, there's not tube anymore. I think I can trash it."
bikewrench,373ryz,cleansoap,2,Sun May 24 17:52:50 2015 UTC,bigger patch will give you the contact area you need to hold back the army of air.

bikewrench,373ryz,greencannondale,2,Sun May 24 17:58:01 2015 UTC,"Ahh, yeah.  Since you have a better solution (before Tuesday) then no need to risk it!  But I'd patch a condom if that's what it took to get through the holiday weekend!"
bikewrench,373550,Plantemanden,1 point,Sun May 24 12:50:20 2015 UTC,Have you tried replacing the cable and housing? It's nothing more than a shifter cable and housing if you do. Also spray the top of the damper where it gets pinched down so that you can break up any crud that's built up.
bikewrench,373550,txbikerider,1 point,Sun May 24 15:56:43 2015 UTC,I have checked the housing. It is fine. Hardly any resistance. Thanks

bikewrench,373qhd,strumptroll,1 point,Sun May 24 18:41:39 2015 UTC,Dunno if you can tell by the pictures but theyre pretty well destroyed. Also if you sand it down wont there be a gap between the 2 sides of he bearings that theyll knock around in?
bikewrench,373qhd,strumptroll,1 point,Mon May 25 17:46:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if they are really bad it probably wont work, and you will have to sand a real lot. But the gap can be adjusted!"
bikewrench,3744o5,MrGiggleTree,2,Sun May 24 18:26:43 2015 UTC,"Depends.    Depends on location and magnitude and how many speeds in the rear.  7 speed rears, for example,  are a heck of a lot more tolerant of slight misalignment than 10 speed rears."

bikewrench,3744o5,ergergroid,2,Sun May 24 18:51:14 2015 UTC,Chances are the derailleur is cooked if it's that far off with a brand new hanger.
bikewrench,3744o5,dura-ace,2,Sun May 24 20:09:39 2015 UTC,Ya thats what I figured just hoping I didnt need to spend $120. I think Ill get a new one and then play around and see if I can straighten it as back up.
bikewrench,3744o5,adyst_,2,Sun May 24 20:18:00 2015 UTC,Might also want to have a shop check the dropout alignment to be on the safe side.
bikewrench,3735mv,FredCompany,2,Sun May 24 12:56:48 2015 UTC,"Sounds like some of the spokes are loose.  If your rim isn't visibly bent and no spokes are broken, most likely a truing and tensioning of the spokes is all that it needs."

Unfortunately the bolt for it is right between the seat tube and the fender - I can't actually tighten it up without removing the back wheel and fender. What I'm going to do instead is remove it if I can - it's not a good enough stand to hold the bike up once it has panniers on anyway.   The wheels need truing at this point anyway, but at least it's not urgent any more - I can just get it sorted while I'm at home at some point this summer."
bikewrench,3735mv,rainwatersoup,1 point,Sun May 31 16:29:01 2015 UTC,Fantastic. I'll get that done and since it's likely that neither of them have ever been trued I might as well get the back trued and tensioned too while I'm at it.

bikewrench,373ll7,sorenbek,6,Sun May 24 15:41:59 2015 UTC,"It almost looks like the hanger itself is bent. I would start there, as it's the easiest fix and the most common thing to become damaged."

bikewrench,371wgt,xxcmtnman,2,Sun May 24 02:23:50 2015 UTC,Yea I have chain tensioner bolts on both bikes. The Vassago has Jabbernuts.....I just have issues with the back wheel shifting around during riding and breaking. I also notice the back tire on my Nature Boy wearing some. Makes me think it's not perfectly aligned.
bikewrench,371wgt,PeanutbutterSamich,5,Sun May 24 02:53:18 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why people aretaking about chain tensioned, they won't do anything for your situation, I don't think they actually read your question  To get the wheel straight i stand behind the bike and use the stays and seat tube and align the wheel between them, so it's centered right on the seat tube. Then tighten down the bolts hand tight or tight enough so the axle doesn't slight for more, then turn the screw tensioner down so they touch the axle/tension the chain, make sure the wheel is centered on the seat tube, get your wrench and tight the axle bolts down, don't be afraid, tighten those fuckers good. You have to have guerrilla strength to over tighten them with a standard 15mm wrench"
bikewrench,371wgt,Aaronplane,2,Sun May 24 03:42:47 2015 UTC,"There are two kinds of things that people call chain tensioners.  You are probably thinking of the devices that take up slack on a chain that has been converted to ss.  The other kind are also referred to as ""chain tugs"" and they are pretty common in the BMX/dj world.  The keep the wheel from pulling forward in the track end, so you don't lose the chain tension that the wheel was installed with.  They also keep the wheel from ""walking"" forward I you don't have/use proper track nuts."
bikewrench,371wgt,PeanutbutterSamich,1 point,Sun May 24 11:37:15 2015 UTC,"Ahh gotcha, the nature boy comes with built in tensioner, there are screws threaded into the front side of the drop outs, I wouldn't rely on them to hold the wheel in place but they do help getting everything set up"
bikewrench,371wgt,cleansoap,2,Sun May 24 13:39:12 2015 UTC,"I just have issues with the back wheel shifting around during riding and breaking.   You're not tightening the axle nuts/skewer enough then.   I also notice the back tire on my Nature Boy wearing some. Makes me think it's not perfectly aligned.   One should be able to visually align looking through the back wheel at the seat tube.  Or look down at the chainstays, the tire should be equidistant from them @ the seat tube.  If the tire is aligned AND wearing unevenly go to /r/bikefit.  I've seen some poor fits lead to some odd rider leans."
bikewrench,371wgt,RichardStinks,3,Sun May 24 03:38:21 2015 UTC,"Chain tensioners. You should be able you find a set for less than $20. They make getting the wheel off one step harder, but they are adjustable enough to get the exact tension you want out of any single speed with track ends, which I'm pretty sure the Nature Boy has."
bikewrench,371wgt,unperfect,1 point,Sun May 24 02:26:58 2015 UTC,The easy fix is to get a chain tensioner. It mounts on your axle and pulls the wheel back.   I have these by Promax and they work very well for me: http://www.promaxcomponents.com/product/c-1-chain-tensioners/

bikewrench,371wkn,cleansoap,3,Sun May 24 03:35:07 2015 UTC,"I think some Shimano cassettes used to require a thin spacer in between the main cassette body and the smaller cogs that add on individually.  If the spacer was forgotten on a work bench the chain would hang up on that one cog due to the improper spacing between cogs.  It was definitely Shimano, and may have been 8 speed rather than 7, but it's something to think about."

bikewrench,371wkn,cleansoap,2,Sun May 24 04:20:19 2015 UTC,I believe /u/Bobatt is thinking of cassettes where only something like the largest 3-4 cogs are attached together and the rest are separate and require you to put a spacer between them.
bikewrench,371wkn,nowhere3,1 point,Sun May 24 04:44:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I was referring to.  I've never seen an Origin 8 cassette in the flesh, but I've definitely had a similar problem with Shimano cassettes."
bikewrench,371wkn,Bobatt,1 point,Sun May 24 05:22:44 2015 UTC,"In that case are not all the spacers identical in size?  Lacking one would put two cogs flat against each other in a very obvious problem situation, not to mention the difficulty in getting the cassette snug on the freehub."
bikewrench,371wkn,cleansoap,1 point,Sun May 24 12:10:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, usually you can still get the last cog snug no matter how much you screw up with spacers because most have notches that won't let the last cog go very far onto the freehub body.  I seriously doubt that OP's problem is caused by any sort of spacer issue."
bikewrench,371wkn,nowhere3,1 point,Sun May 24 23:27:04 2015 UTC,"OP even clarified which cog they meant by ""6th"" and I still totally was picturing the second largest!"
bikewrench,371wkn,cleansoap,1 point,Sun May 24 23:50:51 2015 UTC,The only cassettes that needed the spacer were the 10 speed cassettes. All 8 speed or less need a very thick spacer to fit modern hubs.
bikewrench,371wkn,txbikerider,1 point,Sun May 24 15:59:47 2015 UTC,"8 speed doesn't need a spacer, it's only 7 and 10 speed that do to fit on an 8/9/10 speed freehub."
bikewrench,371wkn,nowhere3,3,Sun May 24 23:06:02 2015 UTC,Some 7 speed cassettes have a small washer that sits behind the smallest two cogs. It's possible they left this out. If you look at the cassette from the side the spacing should be equal between all the cogs. If this washer is missing the gap between 5 and 6 will be about a mm narrower. If this is your problem the noise comes from the chain ticking against the 5th cog when riding in 6th.
bikewrench,371wkn,ergergroid,2,Sun May 24 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"Is it possible that a cassette was defective? Entirely  Is it at all probable? No  More likely there is a spacer missing somewhere.  Also possible that the cog was installed backwards. Most cassettes now a days make that pretty much impossible, but some with less splines, or different spline patterns can be accidentally reversed."
bikewrench,371wkn,byke4130,1 point,Sun May 24 05:47:28 2015 UTC,It could've been damaged in shipping. Generally with 7 speed cassettes only the last cog isn't attached to the cassette carrier so it and the 6th cog are the most likely to be damaged.
bikewrench,371wkn,nowhere3,1 point,Sun May 24 04:43:06 2015 UTC,Ensure that the hub is properly adjusted and that the axle is not broken. Make sure the derailleur hangar is aligned properly also. It is possible your derailleur itself has been damaged too. There are a number of things that could be causing the issue but without pics...
bikewrench,371wkn,sapfromtrees,0,Sun May 24 08:07:03 2015 UTC,Origin 8?  Yeah good chance it was defective.
bikewrench,3724yj,elberto,7,Sun May 24 03:53:42 2015 UTC,I might be wrong but I thought the point of mini v's were so you don't need to use a travel agent?
bikewrench,3724yj,dzjc,3,Sun May 24 04:59:58 2015 UTC,You aren't wrong. Maybe the setup should be tried sans TravelAgent.
bikewrench,3724yj,Hagenaar,1 point,Sun May 24 05:33:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, actually the travel agent is left over from my old wheelset that that definitely needed truing, and the travel agent helped with the rest position of the brakes."
bikewrench,3724yj,byke4130,3,Sun May 24 22:01:29 2015 UTC,Take the travel agent out  Or use the outside edge of the pulley  Either way the issue is the travel agent making the cable pull wrong.

I have CX9s on my ultegra 6700 setup cross bike and they work beautifully."
bikewrench,370ujp,Errod,8,Sat May 23 20:33:16 2015 UTC,"Just as you described. This is not stiff or brittle steel. One at a time, ease the fork leg out and pop it over the axle. This is not something to be done frequently. Once you have the new tire, tube and rim strip on, aim to leave the wheel on the bike. Repair flats by snaking the tube out of the tire and patching it.  Edit: now might be a good time to service the hub if it needs it. Edit2: the hub has a grease nipple! That's old school cool. If the bearings are good, hub maintenance could be just a grease gun away."
bikewrench,370ujp,Hagenaar,3,Sat May 23 20:51:59 2015 UTC,The other oddity with this fork will be it is probably sized for a 5/16th axle and will not be suitable for a modern bolt on or qr wheel

bikewrench,370ujp,grantrules,2,Sat May 23 20:50:47 2015 UTC,Would it be too sacrilegious to cut dropouts into the fork?
bikewrench,370ujp,vinylscratchp0n3,7,Sun May 24 00:39:56 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't. There is no need for frequent wheel removal on a bike like this. And there's no dropout piece, the fork tubes are just flattened at the end. Removing more material would weaken them."
bikewrench,370ujp,Hagenaar,2,Sun May 24 04:33:13 2015 UTC,"You could, very carefully, with an angle grinder, cut slots so you don't have to stress the fork every time you want to take the wheel off. This will likely destroy at least one cutting wheel, be careful when doing this if you attempt it. Only attempt of you feel confident"
bikewrench,370ujp,byke4130,3,Sun May 24 02:45:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do this, the tips on that fork are made by crimping the ends on the tubing together, it's not a separate solid casting.   You'd be left with 4 very thin flaps of heat affected steel keeping your teeth off the road."
bikewrench,370ujp,TheBicyclist,2,Sun May 24 11:03:01 2015 UTC,"Good point. I still think it's probably fine to do, especially if done patiently without overheating the metal, but still probably best to just not"

In your case you've ruled out the bb.  edit: oh watched your vid.

bikewrench,36y0dc,Smaskifa,1 point,Sat May 23 20:26:37 2015 UTC,Sounds like either an overtensioned chain or really messed up rear wheel bearings based on the video.  edit: just saw where you said you 'took the cassette apart' do you mean the wheel bearings or the freewheel itself?

bikewrench,36xog6,gabbagoo,3,Fri May 22 23:49:31 2015 UTC,"First, let's ensure that we're on the same page when discussing trim. This video does a decent job of explaining it from about 1:15 on. If that's what you were talking about (small gears between the big front gears), then it's likely that you're correct in your cable stretch diagnosis. When you adjust the barrel adjusters out, you want there to be absolutely no tension on the cable (so small ring). The orientation in the rear doesn't matter too much unless you're adjusting that one as well.  Make very small adjustments to the barrel adjusters and test to see if your issue has been fixed - I prefer to to two clicks at a time. Once it's fixed with a minimum amount of turns of the barrel adjuster, you're ready to ride.  Edit: the video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EnXU38WMlQ Sorry, mobile, etc."

bikewrench,36xog6,a_fridge,2,Sat May 23 05:50:56 2015 UTC,Is it your low trim that isn't working? Trim is controlled by cable tension so if your low trim doesn't work it will be low cable tension you can use your barrel adjuster to fix that.

To remove the stem (and handlebars) , unscrew the hex on the top of the stem slightly, then tap it down once with a mallet. One hit may be enough. The stem and bars should lift out easily once you feel the stem drop in. After that, installing the bracket should be straightforward."
bikewrench,36wpn3,dialectric,4,Fri May 22 19:18:56 2015 UTC,"Not really, that bracket needs to go in the headset (the two large nuts where the quill stem inserts into the head tube). The top nut needs to removed, and the washer removed and this bracket put in place of the washer. You need headset wrenches to do this properly, but a large adjustable wrench should allow one to remove the top nut. Holding the bottom nut however, is not easy without a headset wrench."

If you're not sure take it to a local bike shop and ask.  Brake pad size isn't so important as long as they fit into the calipers.

For that frame I would probably run 25 or 28 tires.  Buy any 8spd chain, like the SRAM PC 830.  Thread the chain around your chain rings, cassette, and deraillur while your bike is shifted to the smallest cog in the back and the smallest chain ring in the front.  Cut the chain so that it's just short enough so that it doesn't hit the jockey pulley after coming off the tension pulley.  If your cable housing was the correct length to begin with, then using it to measure out your new housing will save you some time.  Otherwise, if you cut it off instead of just removing it in one piece, you'll have to figure out the proper length again.  Cut it a little longer than you think, then try it, and cut it down in small increments until it's the perfect length.  As for a kit, those are sold and typically have enough housing and ferrules to do a complete bike.  My shop also sells bulk housing by the foot, which is typically a better value."

If your current chain is the proper length, then the easy thing to do is to cut your new chain to the same number of links as the old chain. I usually skip that and run the chain on the smallest chain ring and smallest cog, then cut the chain so that it just clears the jockey pulley of the derailleur."

I just mention because the rims seem rusted, and 27"" was more common than 700c in the steel rim days, and they're similar enough sizes that they could take the same rim tape. What do the old tires indicate they were?  Also, once you know if we're talking 700x or 27x for sure, if you want to see if larger tires will fit you need to measure the frame clearance at the bottom bracket, brake bridge (in the rear) and fork crown (in the front) to see if there's enough room. It's a bit too simplistic, but you can assume a tire will be the same height and width as the size says, so, going from say 28mm to 32mm would need 4mm clearance between the chainstays by the bottom bracket, 4mm between the tire and the seat tube, 4mm between the tire and the brake bridge, etc..."

I don't live in a particularly hilly area, so I don't need a huge amount of range. I think anybody living in a place with a lot of hills should go with a triple. There simply isn't enough range in a double. Pros have the advantage that they can swap out chain rings and cassettes depending on the difficulty of the stage, but most people don't have that luxury, so it makes more sense to go with a triple."
bikewrench,36wkm8,Bologna_Pants,2,Fri May 22 18:39:49 2015 UTC,"10 rides isn't much, and the chain is unlikely to wear significantly in that time. As long as the replacement links are the same brand and type of chain, you should be able to add links. Where is your rear derailleur positioned when you are in the highest and lowest gear? Can you take a picture? If the largest (lowest) gear isn't pulling the derailleur too far forward, you may be able to make the gear change without modifying your chain."
bikewrench,36wkm8,dialectric,2,Fri May 22 19:15:34 2015 UTC,"The effective length your chain needs is related to half the chainring's tooth count (since the chain wraps around only half the chainring at a time).  Since you want to increase the chainring by two teeth, that means only one link difference in length - Not a full inch inner+outer link, but a single half-inch link.  So if you feel like your chain is ""on the loose side"" with the 30, you should be all set with no change on the 32.  Likewise if it's ""on the tight side"" you'll want to add an inch (inner+outer link)."

Are you turning the two nuts on the same side of the hub at a time or trying to turn the two larger locknuts on opposite sides?  Often times, if you turn the two locknuts at the same time, they will stay locked against the cone adjustment nut and feel like they aren't coming loose.

More sizes and diagrams: http://www.lightningbikes.com/cranks/bottom-bracket-shells.html  Failing that, if you know you have a BB30 compatible crank then you can likely tell if it's BB30 or PF30 by just looking at the part the crank goes into - PF30 will have plastic 'cups' pressed into the frame while BB30 will not - just metal bearings pressed in with some rubber dust seals covering them up.  edit - just noticed you said you have a MegaExo crank.  If that is true, that would mean it is definitely NOT PF30 or BB30 but rather it's likely an english-threaded ""BSA"" style bottom bracket.  In fact, the article you linked shows that as well.  I'm not sure why the link to your crank has that PF30 logo on it because the crank is definitely NOT that style if it is MegaExo.  If you're trying to replace your existing bottom bracket (to use with the same crank) you will need a replacement MegaExo - this type of bottom bracket has a 24mm diameter spindle on the drive side and 22mm diameter spindle on the non-drive side.

bikewrench,36w7lm,nhluhr,1 point,Fri May 22 17:45:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah your type of BB (again, assuming it is in fact a threaded BSA like it appears from the websites you linked), requires a special 'socket' or wrench similar to these: http://www.parktool.com/product/bottom-bracket-tool-bbt-69 http://www.parktool.com/product/bottom-bracket-tool-bbt-9  It's possible the BB was installed with no grease on the threads in which case a thin dab all around the threads should solve it.  Likewise, a thin smear of grease on the crank's spindle is also appropriate.    There is a big fat bolt a pair of pinch bolts that hold the left crank arm to the spindle and sometimes they need torque and can often eliminate certain creaking/clicking.  You might start with this to see if that is the issue, saving you the cost of tools and effort of removing the BB."

You'll want to check your mfg's torque specs for those (might be printed nearby on the crank arm).  I will say that on a Shimano Hollowtech II style crank (similar), those bolts have a torque spec 12-14Nm which is a lot more than you'd think for a bolt with a 5mm allen head on it.

We were going on a lunchtime ride on a fairly hot (mid 30s°C) day and before heading off, I used a coworker's pump to pump up my tyres to their max recommended pressure — or so I thought.  It turned out later the gauge was reading about 20psi low (compared to my pump's, which was the exact same model).  At the bottom of a fairly lengthy and steep descent, a few seconds after coming to a stop because a bee got stuck in my helmet, there was a rather frightening bang as one of my tyres exploded.  An hour or two later, back in the office, telling my storing and thanking the bee profusely, the other tyre went bang."

The real test of whether the bike fits you is whether you can comfortably stand over the top tube, flat-footed.  (There's other stuff that factors in, but this is a big one.)  Wheel size doesn't really factor into it, as far as I know.  If the frame is ok for you, make sure the seat height is adjusted correctly.  While seated, put one foot on a pedal at the lowest point of its rotation (use a table or fence or a friend to hold yourself up).  Your leg should be just a little bent at the knee, almost extended (but not all the way).    When I stop at lights or stop signs, I dismount by moving myself off the front of the saddle and over the top tube, while taking one foot off a pedal and putting it onto the ground, so that I'm left standing over the top tube.  Or else sometimes the curb is high enough that I can rest one foot on it and stay seated :)  Hope this helps!"

Now, different people have different proportions and just because she can do it doesn't mean you can, but as we're diving into in the other thread the issue at hand may very well be a riding technique one and not a bike fit one.  They do make 650b (smaller wheels) road bikes but going down that avenue starts to close doors, as the selection really drops off quickly.

I've never heard of someone using any type of rubbing compound on a rotor for any reason. Curious to know if anyone else has heard of this.  Also what exactly did he say when he was explaining what he was doing?
bikewrench,36u12c,ArcadiusBaxterLXIX,1 point,Fri May 22 03:01:23 2015 UTC,it was something like this. although it may have been automotive variety.  It resurfaces the pads and discs and removes contaminants.  This was at REI so I'm pretty sure it's not unusual although I had never seen the stuff before.    However. I may have gotten to the bottom of the issue last night when I went over my bike.  Readjusting the pad spacing seems to have helped although I hesitate to declare victory this soon.  TRP Spyres have dual-adjustable pads which I mentioned to the guy at the shop when he started cranking on the barrel adjuster but he was pretty sure in his methods so I figured I'd give them a shot.  Lesson learned.
bikewrench,36u12c,txbikerider,2,Fri May 22 03:42:34 2015 UTC,"Please do not use anything like that. I had a service manager that swore by that stuff but it really lowers breaking power. 3 things that make noise. 1) contaminated pads or rotors, 2) maladjusted calipers, and 3) the holes on the rotors themselves. We have had issues with some bikes where the type of holes on the rotors resinate weirdly with the frames so we switched to a different rotor and all the noise would go away. It seems weird but SRAM were the ones who clued us into it."
bikewrench,36u12c,onespeeder,1 point,Fri May 22 08:29:33 2015 UTC,"I have found that Spyres have to be adjusted properly to eliminate any potential noise. The two sides have to converge equally, or they can create some resonation. It's easy to do with a 3mm Allen.   Anytime a disc is cleaned, rebedding the pads has to happen. Not for the pads, but to leave tiny bits of pad material on the disc itself, making it ""sticky""."
bikewrench,36u12c,nhluhr,1 point,Fri May 22 17:35:43 2015 UTC,Yeah it sounds like you've got contaminated pads or rotors.  Sanding/cleaning contaminated pads is so hit or miss as the oil or whatever is on there can soak in pretty deeply and continue to screw up your brake.  One absolutely sure way to remedy it is replace pads and rotors but of course that's expensive.  I think you might be looking at pads and a thorough cleaning of the rotor using rubbing alcohol and a clean rag.  You could maybe also do a scotchbrite pad scrubbing of the rotor before you clean it with alcohol/rag to scrub off any weird deposits.

Here's a nearly-correct part from Comencal's website:  http://www.commencal-store.co.uk/PBSCProduct.asp?ItmID=12502575 but it says it applies to the Meta V3 frame and your bike I think is the Meta V2.

bikewrench,36sevj,skalnik,2,Thu May 21 20:37:09 2015 UTC,"On my personal bikes I don't use them.  My head tubes are worn for it and I don't really care about it.  On bikes I build they typically have the o-rings installed on the front cable housing from the factory.  They work ok, but they eventually get worked up or down the housing and the housing starts to rub.  If you're worried about it, I think clear packing tape would be your best option.  Check it periodically and replace when necessary."

bikewrench,36s42h,timmyk2000,1 point,Thu May 21 18:00:30 2015 UTC,"What's your budget?  Is your shifting not particularly smooth now?  This bike has been on the road for 5 years.  When's the last time the chain/cassette/chain rings were replaced?  When's the last time the cables and housing replaced?  If your cassette and chain rings aren't that worn, I would start with a new chain, new cables, and new housing.  If that doesn't get you to the level of ""smoothness"" that you're looking for, then look at upgrading your drivetrain to something nicer like XT.  You're going to need new shifters, cassette, chain, and brake levers (because your levers are integrated), so you're looking at dropping a decent amount of money.  I would start with telling us your budget, what's wrong with your current setup, and when the last time you had maintenance performed."
bikewrench,36s42h,55555thatisfivefives,2,Thu May 21 18:25:28 2015 UTC,You don't have to go all the way to XT.  Something like Deore would be fine as well.  I see a lot of customers come in with 3-year old Alivio and it still works great for their needs.
bikewrench,36qmjy,CasualNerdAU,5,Thu May 21 10:13:03 2015 UTC,"I am in the process of completely rebuilding a bike. I'm getting the frame refinished (powder coat) and replacing every single part on it.  I got the bike for £100 and all in it's going to cost me a further £700 to source all the parts.  I could buy a brand new carbon framed bike with the parts I want already on it for £999. This shows that financially it is absolutely not worth it.   That being said, I am doing this to vastly improve my knowledge of bicycles as I am going to cycle 3000 miles around Europe and want to be able to identify and rectify any issues I may have on the road.  If you are keen on taking the bike apart and rebuilding it because you'll enjoy that process, go ahead - it will teach you a lot. Just bear in mind that you won't be saving money.  Onto the frame. If you can purchase it for a nominal fee then take it home and strip all the rust and grease off it you can. WD40 and heavy duty degreaser will be your friends here. It will take time, expect to be reapplying these every day for at least 3 before you start to see metal.  It's very difficult to know if there is rust on the inside of the frame (a big problem if you find it). One way is to pick up the frame and knock it, if it makes a dull sound with no ring to it then you may have issues. Other areas to look at are the head tube and bottom bracket as these need to be round to house the headset and bottom bracket bearings.   Hold the brakes on the bike and see if the front forks rock backwards and forwards. If they do you could have a bad headset or, even worse, a warped head tube. This would show why is was at the scrapyard.  Next remove the chain from the front rings and spin the pedals. Are there any noises? Can you feel it rubbing/grinding on anything? Does it rock side to side? These can all mean new bearings are required or, even worse, the bottom bracket is warped/cracked. This would also show why is was at the scrapyard.  Ultimately the best way to check a bike is to take it for a ride. If it feels comfortable, that's great! If it feels sluggish then you can probably do better.   I'm all for finding project bikes that need some love but sometimes you need to know where to draw the line.  You said the frame is heavy. Why are you interested in a frame that you've already stated has an undesirable characteristic?  As said above, photos would help a lot.   Tl;dr Get a bike that you'll ride rather than a bike that will sit in a garage for months."

bikewrench,36qmjy,UkeOverThere,1 point,Thu May 21 12:26:12 2015 UTC,"I would suggest in that situation that you draw the line at new cables and brake pads. Putting any more money into components may not be worthwhile as you'll probably not be able to sell it for a profit, if at all.   What you should do that will be a great learning experience is to take everything off the bike and give it all a really good clean. Disassembling a rear dérailleur is daunting but gives you insight into how it all works. Reassembling a bike gives you great knowledge on fine tuning the dérailleur to give good shifting. Most importantly though, cleaning the components will show the vast contrast between what bikes should look like and what most bikes become in short periods.  While you've got all the parts off you could even strip the frame, do a good check for rust/cracks/warps and then repaint it how you'd like it to look - a very satisfying way to make the bike your own and it improves the longevity of the frame too."

Replace your pads, it's been 4 years... blah blah.  Wet sand your rotors with a very fine sandpaper and isopropyl alcohol.   Bed the pads in- ride down and up a hill a shit load of times and brake hard, but don't stop. When they start feeling pretty good, do it 10 more times."
bikewrench,36qoxl,adjustedwrench,4,Thu May 21 13:55:52 2015 UTC,"This. Also, you can carefully drive the pistons out one at a time (by holding one back with a plastic tire lever and gently pumping the brake lever) and clean the side of the piston with a q-tip soaked in alcohol. Then dry the piston with the other end of the q-tip.  Next, soak another q-tip in whatever brake fluid your system uses, and dab a thin layer of fluid around the sides of the piston before carefully driving it back in. Repeat for the other piston. This will result in smooth and even action when you apply the brakes."
bikewrench,36qoxl,TunnelSnakeCrew,2,Thu May 21 18:04:30 2015 UTC,Agreed proper break in of new pads is IMPORTANT!

bikewrench,36qoxl,rawmetal,3,Wed Jun 3 02:43:43 2015 UTC,"Unless your pads are contaminated I don't think baking them will help anything. Just get some gritty sand paper and sand the surface so you have a new brake surface to work with. With rotors do the same thing, just sand them so that you have a cleaner surface.   40mph might be too fast to be breaking in those pads. Every bike shop guy has told me just about 25mph to a stop multiple times will go the trick."
bikewrench,36qoxl,Awesomebox5000,2,Thu May 21 11:42:36 2015 UTC,"40mph is way way way too fast to bed brakes. The point of bedding brakes is to ensure they work properly (there's more to it, but this is the end-goal). Crashing at 40mph because your brakes aren't working as they should is a great way to get a giant ER bill or worse. Realistically you should only ever bed brakes on flat ground."

And even if you do, even if you rarely stop any harder than A Downy Feather on a Gentle Breeze, after four years it would not be extravagant to replace them as a show of good faith. (Pad rehab generally isn't worth it except in the unfortunate cases when nearly-new pads get contaminated.)  2) I like to refresh my rotors by sanding them whenever I put new pads on. It isn't hard and doesn't take a lot of work, but because the brakes play a large role in preventing crashes it's the kind of job you need to do right every time.  3) Sorry to nitpick, but you spelled ""brakes"" correctly once."
bikewrench,36qoxl,txbikerider,1 point,Thu May 21 12:01:24 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, nit picking is okay.  I have changed my pads once, It's probably about time to change them again. though through most of this I was referring to my baker discs."
bikewrench,36qoxl,link1896,3,Thu May 21 13:08:32 2015 UTC,"I've tried baking the pads and it only makes your house smell like shit. Brake cleaner is designed for cars where the braking forces are much higher and the brakes get scolding hot, your bicycle's brakes will never get that hot. I agree with the rest, new pads, clean the rotors (wet sand with iso or just replace the whole rotor), and then a proper pad/rotor bedding and you should be good. According to our Shimano Tech guy if you change pad material you should change rotors as well but I only see this as an issue going from the softer resign (or organic for some brands) to the metallic pad materials."
bikewrench,36qoxl,pewpjohnson,1 point,Fri May 22 08:35:10 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it's to do with the idea that you've just cleaned your discs and now you're going to use dirty pads on them?

Inside the freewheel (thread on gear cluster) or the freehub (part of the hub onto which gear cluster slides onto) is a set of spring loaded pawls. These collapse when you coast and expand when you pedal, grabbing the inside of a ring lined with notches. If they get gummed up and don't expand, no power gets transferred to wheel. Google ""freewheel vs freehub"" or ""freewheel vs cassette"" and compare photos to your rear gear cluster to figure out which one it is. Either way you can likely temporarily solve it by loading up the inside of the mechanism with spray lubricant like triflow."
bikewrench,36pw7b,802bikeguy_com,5,Thu May 21 04:24:47 2015 UTC,"The quick release is normal. You don't need to unscrew it completly to remove the wheel. You just open it up, loosen it a few turns and then you can take the wheel out. The spring you can do without, but if you still have it put it back on there. The spring is cone shaped. The cone should be pointing to the wheel, big outside, small inside."
bikewrench,36pw7b,Stickytapemeasure,1 point,Thu May 21 06:27:43 2015 UTC,"If it's a stock Schwinn it probably has a freewheel.  If that is the case, you need something like this.  A bike shop could replace it easily for a small fee, or you could order the proper tool to remove it and do it yourself.  Note: Make sure the replacement freewheel has the correct number of cogs"
bikewrench,36ovc7,Dingareth,7,Wed May 20 23:26:17 2015 UTC,Take the 1 good nut to a hardware store like ace hardware. Tell them you need deez nuts.
bikewrench,36ovc7,802bikeguy_com,1 point,Thu May 21 00:33:56 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth I've done that and spent around $5 on 16 cent nuts of all sizes trying to find it.  That's what inspired this post- none of Ace, Home Depot, or a local hardware store had anything that fit.  They all figured it was some sort of proprietary size, but based on other responses it seems like it could be some sort of bike specific size.  I'll try that- thanks though."
bikewrench,36ovc7,802bikeguy_com,2,Thu May 21 04:37:59 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're stuck with one nut like ole Lance... at least for the meantime.  Ace hardware should have a nut and bolt figure-outer thingy, where you can try to thread your nut onto multiple different sizes and pitches, and one should fit. I really can't imagine it's not Metric nor SAE.   There's a chance your nut is damaged, the threads, specifically. If that's the case, the axle threads may also be damaged. It might be easier just to install a new axle and bearing cones, which will also come with a fresh pair of nutz."
bikewrench,36ovc7,Hagenaar,1 point,Thu May 21 04:49:20 2015 UTC,"Visit a fastener specialist. Names like Bolt Warehouse etc. There are several in the city I'm in. Take the wheel with you.

bikewrench,36ovc7,geronimo2000,1 point,Thu May 21 01:51:32 2015 UTC,The question is going to be whether the threads are 26tpi or 25.4tpi.  If the hub is Shimano it could be either.  I would buy a set of 26tpi from some place like this and if it doesn't work you're only out $5 plus shipping.

bikewrench,36ovc7,Vojta7,1 point,Thu May 21 04:38:40 2015 UTC,I have hubs that originally had a 9.5mm axle  - an M10 nut would screw on but have a little wiggle room. Could that be what you have?

bikewrench,36o8zz,mountainslayer,1 point,Wed May 20 22:26:48 2015 UTC,The third (and more likely IMHO) possibility is that the dropouts were always at ~133mm and the owner only noticed when paying extra attention to them after the incident.  Surly spaces all their (road) frames at 132.5mm so that road and mtb hubs both fit equally well.
bikewrench,36o8zz,cleansoap,2,Fri May 22 13:52:23 2015 UTC,"Surly does this because they make steel frames, steel will easily accommodate 2.5mm of difference, alum. and carbon does not like to stretch like steel does, so you wont find alum or carbon frames with 132.5mm spacing  Edit: I think cleansoap is probably right"
bikewrench,36o8zz,PeanutbutterSamich,1 point,Fri May 22 15:11:59 2015 UTC,"Carbon and Al frames can happily spring +- 2.5mm total, 1.25mm per stay.  The idea that a carbon frame is damaged to the point of a larger rear gap but shows no screaming huge crack is unfathomable."
bikewrench,36o8zz,cleansoap,1 point,Sat May 23 01:12:49 2015 UTC,"Yea as I think about it more I think your right, 1.25mm is pretty dam small, nothing else makes sense"

bikewrench,36ny4i,stevo6954,1 point,Wed May 20 19:37:14 2015 UTC,That actually sounds more like the freewheel than the crank. Pull the chain off and see if the crank feels loose or doesn't rotate freely on its own. If everything feels good i'm more inclined to believe its your freewheel.
bikewrench,36ny4i,D0rk4L,1 point,Wed May 20 19:45:38 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting idea, i'll check this afternoon. I hope it's not the freewheel, I just replaced my back wheel 8 months ago."

bikewrench,36mb2w,Flintoid,2,Wed May 20 13:08:24 2015 UTC,So where the crank attaches to the bb?
bikewrench,36mb2w,Flintoid,3,Wed May 20 13:21:30 2015 UTC,Yes.  I would get these funky click sounds like something was slipping against something else.  When I put a quarter to a half turn into the connection it went away.  Usually just an Allen wrench fix.

bikewrench,36mb2w,MTFUandPedal,1 point,Wed May 20 13:13:41 2015 UTC,"There's a long list of possibilities, people have been driven mad trying to work it out.  BB is the most likely.  After that:   Pedals Chainrings Cassette Sticking jockey wheel on rear mech loose cable (seriously, occasional click on hard pedal stroke could be a cable sometimes clonking inside a carbon frames internal routing)   There's a long list of things that make annoying occasional noises!"
bikewrench,36mb2w,icanhasreclaims,3,Wed May 20 14:03:02 2015 UTC,"Well there isn't any internal cable routing so I'm guessing that is out. I'll look at the rear mech, and I'll double check the chainrings.   Hopefully it's just a loose bolt or something in the bb."

If I wanted to use an Italian crankset I have the option of using spacers, or you can use an Italian bottom bracket on a French shell with a british crank (they're both 68mm). You rethread to Italian because a) it's metric so the tap goes in easier b) so you don't have to apply braze to the threads and destroy the paint on all sides, because it's slightly larger you just remove the old threads altogether."
bikewrench,36kmly,lperohgf0348y80y,1 point,Wed May 20 15:47:43 2015 UTC,"Italian BB threads are 36mm by 24tpi so it's not quite metric and it's harder on the taps than you might think. They need to ream the french threads first. If I were a shop I wouldn't risk my taps on this kind of operation, they are expensive to replace and if one of them breaks inside your frame good luck getting it out."
bikewrench,36kmly,audiocycle,1 point,Wed May 20 16:13:51 2015 UTC,I totally agree. Even if a shop has all the tools it's a big job. Italian BB taps are +400$.

bikewrench,36kmly,kinboyatuwo,2,Thu May 21 03:08:16 2015 UTC,There's nothing to gain by upgrading a cottered-crank Peugeot all the way to a hollowtech crank. If the crank is cottered the rest of the frame is gonna be high-tensile steel which is part of the nice ride of these frames. The VO bottom brackets are pretty light and a decent square tape crank isn't that heavy if the rings are aluminum. I'd recommend the sugino xd600 if you want a triple.

I changed the tube in my back tire once, and it's never been the same since. I'm sure they are minor and easy to fix to most people though. I'm not interested in a high performance bike yet depending on where you set the cut off. I'd like something I can ride three miles to work. Can this bike currently achieve this? Yes. But it's a hellish situation.   There is exactly one bike shop in any kind of coherent distance to me. They rip people off because they know they can.

bikewrench,36lb6x,kopsis,1 point,Wed May 20 13:47:10 2015 UTC,"Bicycle repairs are not difficult relative to other mechanical tasks, but the reality is that some people just aren't ""wired"" with an intuitive sense of how machines work and that makes learning to do repairs and modifications difficult even with proper instruction.  Changing to singlespeed is not an ""insert tab A in slot B"" kind of thing. You'll have to figure out how to achieve proper chainline, how to tension the chain, how to keep the chain from dropping, what gear ratio to run, etc. If you're considering singlespeed because you can't get your drivetrain adjusted properly, you're not likely to have a lot of success with the conversion.  You might be better off to describe the problems with your bike in enough detail that people here can help diagnose them. Armed with the knowledge of what really needs to be done (and what it should cost) you can have your local bike shop do the work with much less fear of being ripped off."

I modified the back brake to make it work - long-reach calipers, but with a recessed bolt that was too short - found a brake with nutted bolts of the same make and swapped the bolt. Front brake though, is one component I do not want to risk failure on with a questionable mod."

You can get ""longer reach"" brakes.  I think you are saying that the pads are too high is that correct?  It's not hitting the rim?"

I know I can simply buy new brakes, but I'd like to keep my components of the same era if possible. I've already looked at the tektro 556, and 559, and they're very nice options...but decidedly not vintage.

The best places to get stuff like that can either be Amazon or if you have a good community bike shop nearby you can do the work there and buy basic supplies without having to invest in all the tools you might need to do a complete overhaul.   If the wheels are out of true and there is lots of rust issues you might be in for more money than a basic single speed commuter bike would cost.

bikewrench,36jk56,bee627,3,Tue May 19 21:28:44 2015 UTC,"There are a few issues I have come across with  bumps in a tire. I will start with the most common.  Issue#1) Tire wasn't seated properly when inflated.  Solution) Deflate the tire and the inflate alittle slower making sure the head sits right all along the rim on both sides. Inflate to max pressure to ensure any pesky parts of the tire seat.  Issue#2) The rim tape is not on correctly or it is the wrong width for the tire, and it is sitting on the area of the rim where the tire bead will go. Therefore, the bead won't set properly.  Solution) If the rim tape IS the right width, meaning it covers the inside of the nipples and that's about it, make sure the tape is aligned all the way around. If it is the wrong width, get the right kind. If it isn't accessible at the moment, temporary rim tape can be used (eg. Electrical tape, stand no-tubes tape...), but make sure you get actual rim tape at some point.   Issue#3) Your tire could be defective (cheap tires) or hit the tire hard causing the internal stitching of the tire to rip. You can't see the rip visibly, but it is there. Now there is a weak spot in the tire and all the pressure from the tube will make the tire bulge out since it is rubber.  Solution) If none of the other solutions fix the issue, this is it. Buy a new tire and spend a little more money. A decent tire is gonna start you at $25-$35. A better WILL last you longer. I can promise you that.   Issue#4) The wrong size tube was installed, probably a larger one. This wouldn't normally cause the tire to bulge, but you never know. Just get a new tube that's the correct size. If your tire says 700x23c, then a 700x18-23 or a 700x23-25 size tube will work. If it says 26x1.8 then a 26x1.8-2.125 will work.   Any questions about anything biking, just message me."

bikewrench,36hsmm,Gildomaximus,1 point,Tue May 19 19:44:44 2015 UTC,"Try shifting it to the highest gear(smallest cog) in the rear, then loosen the binder bolt holding the cable. Put it taunt with your hand and tighten it. Usually, when you pull it taunt in the smallest cog, as you go down the gears, it increases tension. Then shift all the way to first gear (biggest cog), then adjust the limit screw. The L adjusts the large cog. Adjust the screw until you see it move, and then make sure it's aligned with the biggest cog. Once it stops moving stop adjusting. Do the same with the smallest cog by shifting all the way up. Then adjust the H limit screw. After this, make sure it goes to the highest and lowest gear. If it does, or It almost does, start adjusting the barrel adjuster. It can be located at the derailleur where the cable goes into it, at the shifters where the cable comes out of them, or in-line with the cables going to the derailleur. Spin the the pedals and adjust accordingly until you stop hearing hard chatter and the chain goes up and down the cassette or free wheel easily, without skipping or hopping or jumping.

If so, it sounds like your cable tension is probably just  a little too high. Try backing it off with the barrel adjuster, just two or three clicks clockwise.

Then work in by either spinning the pedals and working it up and down the gears, or take the wheels off and then just shift the derailleurs all the way the through. Then wipe off any excess because you don't want to extract dirt. Now for the chain, don't use tri-flow. Use a dedicated chain lubricant. If you ride In a very wet environment use wet chain lube. If not, use dry. Now make sure you always wipe your chain off before lubricating it when it comes to basic maintenance. To really clean your chain, take it off, and shoot it with degreaser and blow it off with a compressor and wipe it down.

bikewrench,36gbn3,audiocycle,2,Wed May 20 20:24:26 2015 UTC,"I accidentally bought one of these monstrosities. Identical.  It was badged up as a Ritchey post and it was obviously a fake on receipt (came with a saddle that wasn't dodgy so ah well, I wanted the saddle).  Firstly the two cone shaped sections slot into the seatpost and are retained by a two bolts screwing into each other in the middle, with a small spring. The cones aren't an exact fit in the cut outs for them in the seatpost.  There is a metal outer washer on each end of the bolt that clamps against the small carbon piece and holds the seat on when the bolt is tensioned.  It's a nightmare to get all 4 (the two washers, the slots on the carbon cones) lined up with the saddle.  Even when tightened with far more tension in the bolt than I'm comfy with using on a carbon post, the saddle will tilt forwards on every jolt (hit a pothole hard enough) and then needs to be tilted back into position - I suspect this is due to a single bolt in the centre of the post acting as a pivot.  Not sure how the Ritchey singlebolt design they ripped off actually manages to avoid that however users of the superlogic and WCS kit haven't reported the same issue.  To add to the ""it was crap out of the box"" you've likely caused more damage. On the bright side it's a good excuse to get a seatpost that wont try and kill you.  Please put this in the bin.

But look at how 'tall' a bearing is on its edge compared to standing 'flat' - if it exited the aluminum BB shell like that, the mouth of the BB shell was, for a second or so, that wide. Aluminum doesn't stretch like that. What if I go back to BB30 bearings later? Or whoever buys my used bike does? Will they still fit tight?  Picture an aluminum tube over a rigid steel cone. I slam the tube down over the steel cone with a rubber mallet, until the aluminum tube is opened up slightly. Then take it back off. Would you think the aluminum tube is within spec? The precision-made part, even if it still 'works' - is nowhere near the precision it once was. Just because it isn't visibly cracked or oval does not mean it hasn't been widened.  I'm posting here to have my fears put away, so like I said, it's encouraging to get downvoted and made fun of for worrying. I just can't comprehend that this worry isn't irrational.

The BB30 standard is pretty shitty and everyone in the industry knows that; it always ends up creaking and it relies on a press-fit. Each time the bearings are removed, that press-fit gets used and weakens. If you take a new bike and the right tools, you will still eventually get the slip-fit you know seem to have. Green Locktite (for retaining sleeves) is designed to alleviate this problem.   Assuming the mechanic did a bad job, he only fast-forwarded the life of your bike by a bit. You will probably end up using green locktite one day either way.   If you really want to measure the frame,I'd recommend waiting for a problem to arise before talking the the bearings out. Minimize the number of installs/uninstalls.  Your comparison with the aluminium tube is also skewed, there is a possibility the aluminium was slightly burred but the deformation is strongly limited by the thickness of you BB shell"
bikewrench,36hlls,velvet7,3,Tue May 19 17:57:24 2015 UTC,"Borrow a Micro-Caliper and measure that shit. If it's close enough then there's probably nothing wrong. Aluminium doesn't really stretch under pressure over a short period of time, it's tough stuff.   I'm willing to bet that because your shop is a seller of your bike they've worked on them a bit and know enough not to entirely fuck your shell.  The BB30 system sucks there's no way around it, I understand your frustration working with them. If you can do everything better than everyone else, buy the damn tools! You'll save money in the long run and if you don't need them after one use, sell them used."
bikewrench,36hlls,stanspaceman,1 point,Tue May 19 16:24:02 2015 UTC,"I do agree that I'd hope their only mechanic, in a shop that sells lots of BB30 bikes, should be confident. But why does every instruction about pressing bearings (headset too!) warn against putting them in crooked? That's what happened here, they were crooked for a bit.  I just don't see how people say I'm overreacting here, but if I installed headset bearings crooked, one side at a time, I think people would rightly warn that I probably messed up the head tube. Just because it isn't visibly warped or cracked doesn't mean it did not undergo permanent deformation.  I don't have a second outboard bearing wrench that I would need to unscrew the adapter from itself. Maybe I need one, but that's the situation now. Even if I do open it up, remove stuff, measure it... they could always say I did it myself by removing it. So far the shop is the only point of accountability, that's why I went there for such a delicate task.  Remember the part about the adapter slipping in by hand. It was supposed be pressed in! That's the main reason I took it to the shop in the first place. Could just be manufacturing tolerances or something, but no press needed at all?"
bikewrench,36hlls,stanspaceman,2,Tue May 19 16:43:35 2015 UTC,"You are warned against installing bearings crooked because of accelerated bearing wear and/or a crank that refuses to skin smoothly. The shell will be fine. I've done hundreds of bb30 installs and removals, many of which I've done with a punch to remove the bearings"
bikewrench,36hlls,Bobatt,1 point,Tue May 19 18:05:28 2015 UTC,"Well the shop should be doing it the right way, using a jerry-rigged screw driver setup to set the bearings is not cool. If they don't have the tools they shouldn't do the labor.  I've been working as a shop mechanic for over a year now and I'll say that usually when we resort to these circumstances it's for a reason - eg. if I'm drilling out and rethreading something on a frame it's because the bike was a POS in the first place. I haven't seen your bike so I don't know if that's the case.  Either way, I strongly doubt they've done any damage to the frame - BB30 systems sort of damage themselves, this is likely what you're noticing. Let me explain.  Press fit bottom brackets, particularly BB30-like systems, tend to start squeaking after a period of use. THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE BB30 SYSTEM. It's part of the design, think about it. All that holds those bearings in place is friction. If you slam a pair of bearings in, there is going to be some sort of fatigue/stretch.  That means the next pair will be pretty easy to reinsert. What sucks about this fallibility is that it's prone to squeaking problems.   What we do at my shop for BB30 systems that need to get pulled out and reinserted is use a special formula of locktite that holds them in place. It's become common practice in the shop because we've done it hundreds of times."
bikewrench,36hlls,shittypromech,1 point,Tue May 19 17:21:31 2015 UTC,"I completely understand the BB30 'lifespan' issue. But that's exactly what I am saying - this poor removal might have been the equivalent of 20 'proper' changes, since the stretch was excessive as compared to a properly drifted bearing. Maybe more: a drifted bearing only induces friction and only stretches the shell to (approximately) the bearing width. Forcing it out sideways stretches it farther.  I have heard of voided warranties due to Loctite. Not that I wouldn't resort to that if I heard creaking. Like I hope I mentioned before, even if this does creak, it could have happened anyway with proper removal. If it doesn't creak, it doesn't mean the removal went well... the creaking doesn't mean much. The bike didn't come with any Loctite.  I just don't want to be in a different city in 3 years with an ovalized shell and the manufacturer denies my warranty claim because they can't be sure it was the shop's fault... who knows how many people have touched the bike over the last few years? That's why I'm trying to come to terms with this NOW.  I assure you that the reliance on the screwdriver was a lack of tools (which I find incredible for a shop with so many BB30 bikes for sale/service), and beating it out unevenly was at best a poor decision, at worst a misunderstanding. The bike is definitely not to blame.  But thank you, your words are reassuring."
bikewrench,36hlls,mmmdamngoodjava,1 point,Tue May 19 17:47:04 2015 UTC,"I'll say it again, I doubt they really did much damage. If you start riding and ""shits fucked"", bring it back into the same shop and explain what's wrong. Also, KINDLY ask them why they don't have a press/proper tools, to be fair I use a screwdriver and mallet when I work on BBs pretty regularly with no issues.  No the bike doesn't come with loctite this is an aftermarket solution.   If you're really that concerned about it call your manufacturer now and document the issue. If they have nothing to really say at least you've got documentation of the incident. A few years down the line if you do need to do a warranty that might save your ass.  Remember, most shops are there to make sure you're enjoying your biking experience because they love it and want to spread the sport. They wouldn't fuck up your bike if they can avoid it, that's just more work for them. If they're rude or dickish to you that isn't excusable but it's probably because they're incredibly busy during this time of season.  Be extremely kind and polite it will go a long way."
bikewrench,36hlls,link1896,1 point,Tue May 19 17:54:10 2015 UTC,"Part of what makes this so hard is that I am friends with everyone in the shop - I don't think I've let on that there's even any unhappiness with the work. It makes it difficult to raise concerns when I get good deals, after-hours help, and drink beer on the weekends with them. That's why it is a last resort to go back to the shop complaining, demanding, and considering asking for a new $$$ frame even if things get creaky (which will probably hurt them in the eyes of the manufacturer if it's deemed to be due to improper work)."
bikewrench,36hlls,link1896,2,Tue May 19 19:01:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think you should be relying upon the ease with which the bb was pressed in as your only evidence that the bb shell is stretched out.  In my experience, when aluminum goes out of round for various reasons it can still be difficult to press in bearings.  Back in the early days of freeride, it was common to have bikes come in with ovalized head tubes cause by big drops.  The cups would still be held in place by part of the head tube, but there wasn't even contact all around.  When we'd try to press in a headset, the cups would still press into the frame where there was contact (usually on the sides), but there would be a gap to the front and rear.    It's unlikely that the bb shell would be damaged in such a way that it would be evenly larger the whole way round.  If there were damage to the shell, it would be evidence by an uneven press fit, gaps between the cups and the shell or paint chipping and cracking, not the ease in which a bearing slides in.    I think it'll be fine.  Ride your bike."
bikewrench,36i3qa,lavaslippers,2,Tue May 19 15:35:59 2015 UTC,"Biggest problem is, as you've mentioned, you'll need some sort of adapter to mount the wheel in a truing stand.

Headset R&R is not beyond the ability of most novices. You can tap out the old races with a screwdriver and mallet, carefully going around the circumference slowly, new ones can be tapped in with a mallet and wood block, again, slowly and evenly. The hard part is usually the crown race on the steer tube, you may need a thin blade to get the removal started and a piece of metal tube to drive the new one on evenly.

Plenty of people buy decent bikes, ride them a bit, then quit riding.    TBH, not a huge difference from 10-11 cogs.  In fact, the shifting can be more fiddly."

I need components either way for the cross bike, and doing it like this gives me the psychological boost of newness and personalization to my road bike, which I've ridden more or less bone stock for a few years.

Secondly, do you compete, or is the bike a 60 mile ride with the guys on the weekend kind of bike?  Overall, upgrading everything like that gets Expensive. Fast. You may or may not have chain line issues with a new crankset, meaning a new BB as well. Brakes are questionable as well. I understand drive train, but you're not going to get some crazy performance upgrade in one step up to Ultegra.   Bottom Line- You seem like you know what you're doing for the most part, but you're spending a LOT of money for parts that miht not be very neccesary. If you're not competing, there's no need for 11 speed. What it comes down to is a fuckload of $$ when you burn through a chain and cassette. You're looking at like $150 for a new chain and cassette once a year. Just keep in mind the long run."

I've had two great seasons with it so far, there's nothing better.... for 45-60 minutes.  The plan is to have the Meuse with some beater wheels as the Sunday cruise bike. This hopefully will soak up a lot of the miles and I won't go through the good stuff as fast.  I am a little worried about BBs, but with one PF30 and one BB30 I figured I'm stuck with that regardless. Earlier today I heard the Icon's creak for the first time..."

He left the fixed cup in, thinking the painter would mask it off, but the guys were perfectionists and removed it, but they had to use heat. Sheldon wouldn't use a possibly compromised cup and installed one from his private stash. Battle of perfectionists (over an old Raleigh, no less).

You can also try threading the new bb into the frame if the thread pitch doesn't match it will bind after the first thread.

When you release the brake, does the handle have some tension forcing it back open? If not the brake cable could be stuck in the casing and is not allowing the brake to open up."
bikewrench,36f7sq,Moynihad,1 point,Mon May 18 23:42:26 2015 UTC,"I bought them entire bike new back in January, although it didn't see much use in the first month due to really crappy weather. The brake has been well used though, as I live in a rather hilly city, and have a few places where I have to brake to almost a complete stop to make some corners.  There is some tension when first releasing it, but I've noticed it can be pulled a few millimeters without affecting the brake at all, which isn't possible for the front brake lever (where I can see the pads move and even the slighest pull of the lever). I realize this isn't a very clear explanation. In short; back brake has a lot of tension when first releasing it, but doesn't really go all the way back in. Front brake has much more ""linear"" tension, and goes back in completely."
bikewrench,36f7sq,Moynihad,1 point,Tue May 19 07:26:13 2015 UTC,"Try pulling the arms of the brake apart, they should be tight to the cable when the lever is fully opened."
bikewrench,36f7sq,Mizrul,1 point,Tue May 19 07:33:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, Multi Step process to go through here.  Firstly, if you have any decent lube, get it. (WD40 is NOT a lube)  First things first you're gunna want to screw the barrel adjusters all the way back into the lever (what you unscrewed to tighten the cable).  Next, pull the pieces of housing out of the cable guides on your frame. Trace the rear brake cable back and pull all those, sliding them on the cable to make sure that the housing isn't rusted to the cable.   If all is good there, realign your brake pads. Easiest way to do it is to disconnect the springs on the back of your brake arms. There'll be a little knub sticking out of the back of the arm that's holding a spring from overextending. Pull the spring lightly away from the arm until it clears the knub and pops out. There should be no tension on the arm now and you should be able to freely push each arm into the wheel. Now loosen your pad, push the arm to the wheel, and tighten the pad down to where it's flat and centered on the braking surface. Reset that spring. Repeat for the other brake arm.  Check your wheel true next. Stand directly over the wheel (or behind it if you have a proper stand), and spin it to see if it wobbles side to side. If it does, go to your LBS and have your wheel trued. (Might want to wait until the end so that they can double check your work).  If your wheel doesnt wobble (horribly- chances are it will have a slight wobble, but probably not much), then put your housing back into the cable guides ad reattach your cable noodle.  Now release the cable retention bolt, and pull tension on your cable until your brake pads are about 3-5 mm away from either sie of the rim, and tighten the bolt down hard. It's hard to overtighten those.   The last thing to play with is the spring tension. On either arm there will be a little screw that adjusts the spring tension on either arm. The goal here is to get the arms so that they contact the rim at the same time on both sides. Tightening the Screw=More tension=Pulls pad further from rim. The more tension the better in MOST cases.   http://imgur.com/gallery/MVeO42s  Sorry for being so long winded! I only edited one picture, as the other arm is gunna be identical accept it has no cabe retention bolt. This is what I'd call a full brake reset. Just redoing everything from the beginning and seeing if it helps! Good luck!"

bikewrench,36d3v7,awuhtofjoa,9,Mon May 18 12:48:54 2015 UTC,"Possible, maybe.  Worthwhile, or smart?  Almost never.    First, the easy part:  brakes.  Your frame may or may not be drilled for brakes.  If there's no seatstay bridge (or if it's not drilled), you may have to get a rear brake kit, that clamps onto the frame.  They aren't the best looking, and will probably need more adjustment/maintenance than a standard brake that a road bike has.    On the front, if your fork is super-tight clearance, even a kit probably won't work, and you'd need to swap that out.  Otherwise, there are bolt-on kits for front brakes too, and those are also not the best looking.  Many forks are already drilled for a front brake, and if not, many can be drilled to accept one.  Consult your LBS/local framebuilder.  Gears are the main reason why this is a dumb idea.  A lot of track bikes can take brakes, but gears are way, way tougher.  There's two  approaches:  hub gearing, or going frankenstein.  Hub gearing is probably the best, but it is pretty expensive, and can be a pain to set up, depending on what you go with.  Basically you get a new rear wheel and shifter (usually they come together) and put them in there.  Shimano, Sram, Rohloff ($$$), and a few other companies make internally geared (IG)hubs and shifters.  Be forwarned, most shifters are proprietary, and very few 3rd party shifters are out there.  Depending on the hub, you may need to respace your track ends (most track bikes are 120mm between the ends, many IG hubs are wider than that (130mm road, or 135mm hybrid/mtb) or may require some minor surgery (removal of locknuts, etc) to get to that width.    Frankensteining it would require a new road wheel, and one of these guys.  You'd definitely need to respace your frame (130mm is the current standard, unless you get an older 7-speed or less wheel).  Front derailleurs are commonly clamp on, so that's (thankfully) easy, but you might need a new crankset if you decide to go with a multi-ring drivetrain, and that may require a new bottom bracket as well.  Shifters will depend upon what type of drivetrain you go with, but all told, it's expensive.  You'd also need either some clamp on cable stops, or run full-length shifter housing from the shifter to the rear derailleur(s) (not a good look) and one clamp-on stop for the front derialleur, if you use one.  All told, if your bike is newer and not as track-specific, adding brakes can cost less than $50 and be an easy, reversible, safety-increasing modification.  If it's a very track specific frame, it can be more expensive but still useful.  Adding gearing will be relatively expensive no matter what, and will have multiple modes of failure and will probably require you to alter your frame spacing."
bikewrench,36d3v7,Aaronplane,1 point,Mon May 18 13:33:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed reply! The frame I'm looking at only has a front brake mount. I'm not sure if the aluminum frame can be respaced. The only reason why I am thinking of doing this is because I love the frame, and have plenty of spare parts/other road bikes lying around. With this in mind, I don't want to make it too ugly. However, I am willing to frankenstein it a bit so I can take it long rides through hilly terrain comfortably. I would be ok with just leaving it as a track bike, but that would mean less use :("
bikewrench,36d3v7,cleansoap,3,Mon May 18 14:09:01 2015 UTC,1 - Can not respace that frame.  2 - Can not use clamp-on stops and shifters on non-round aluminum tubing.  Get a Zydeco or Experience frame.
bikewrench,36d3v7,Aaronplane,1 point,Mon May 18 14:23:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is what I figured, aluminum and all. I still like the frame enough to leave it as a track frame to ride around town."
bikewrench,36d3v7,Aaronplane,2,Mon May 18 14:53:20 2015 UTC,"Those frames are very nice, and I think they hold their value pretty well (for the time being).  Have you tried just lowering your gearing a bit?    If you absolutely need gears and can only have one bike, if I were you I'd probably tearfully sell the bike/frame and get a pretty road bike.  Respacing the rear on an aluminum frame isn't usually a very good option, and all the clamp-on stuff isn't great for the (wonderful) paint on that frame, which is a big part of its value."
bikewrench,36d3v7,cleansoap,1 point,Mon May 18 14:16:44 2015 UTC,"I don't absolutely need gears.

bikewrench,36d3v7,mountainslayer,4,Mon May 18 14:54:14 2015 UTC,Except for the lack of cable stops and possibly the lack of front and/or rear brake drillings all you really need is a 5 speed 120mm wide rear hub and a combination chain tug / derailleur hanger from Problem Solvers.  Since you won't have cable stops I'd suggest new or used clamp on downtube shifters.  A bottom bracket cable guide depending on how you route things.  If you don't have the bottom bracket hole for it use a bit of automotive trim glue or tape - it's not under any real shear force so it doesn't take much to hold it.

bikewrench,36d3v7,JamesB5446,3,Mon May 18 13:57:29 2015 UTC,"You really need to consider a five-speed rear end.  1 - Shimano 105, unless you're talking first generation 105 (?), means a 130mm wide hub.  You have a 120mm wide rear end.  2 - That dérailleur hanger isn't the most precise piece of kit in the world.  Friction shifting a 5-speed rear end is one thing but the cable pull precision needed for 9 or 10 speed indexed rears is insane.  11 speed should be more forgiving as Shimano has dramatically increased the amount of cable pulled by the rear shifter.  3 - You have no rear dérailleur cable stop.  You'll be running lots of housing.  This exacerbates the problem.  See point #2."

bikewrench,36b0tw,Aun_vre,5,Mon May 18 18:31:46 2015 UTC,"From Sheldon Brown:  Extension leversIn the early 1970s, many people bought bicycles with drop handlebars, for reasons of fashion, even though drop bars did not suit their casual riding style. Given the frame and stem designs commonly available at the time, it was generally impossible to get drop handlebars high enough up to allow a low-intensity rider to reach the drops comfortably.  The problem was worse for many women, whose shorter torso made it hard to reach forward to the drops. Though a taller handlebar stem with less forward reach might be installed, this often did not occur. Also, small hands could not comfortably grasp typical drop-bar brake levers of that time.  Dia Compe invented bolt-on extensions that allowed Weinmann-type brake levers to be operated from the tops and middle of the handlebars, making this type of bar bearable for casual cyclists, since they never had to use the drops. This was so popular that Weinmann traded licensing with Dia Compe, so that each could copy the other's products.  (Stem shifters were also popularized around the same time, and for the same reason.)  This system has several drawbacks:  The extension lever partially applied the main brake lever, reducing the available lever travel. Not all brands/models suffered from this, but the most common ones did.The attachment hardware precluded the use of the top of the brake lever hood as a comfortable riding position.They encouraged the practice of riding with the hands on the top, middle section of the bar, which is a position that doesn't give very secure control, especially on bumpy surfaces, because the hands are too close together.The hardware that held the extension levers to the main levers was prone to fall off.  Other manufacturers produced similar systems, some of which addressed some of these difficulties.  Extension levers are sometimes known as ""safety levers."" Since many people believe they actually reduce safety, the slang terms ""death grips"", ""suicide levers"" and ""turkey wings"" are occasionally substituted.  In the early 21st century, a greatly improved system of ""interrupter brake levers "" appeared, with all of the advantages and none of the drawbacks of the older extension levers. These also have the advantage of being compatible with modern ""æro"" brake levers which work a lot better than the older style levers that had the cables coming out of the tops."

Thanks for giving the other side of the argument though, I didn't think it would be 100% one way or the other."
bikewrench,36b0tw,JamesB5446,-1,Mon May 18 23:03:38 2015 UTC,"I've heard them called ""cheater brakes"" but not suicide levers. What's suicidal about them? They're actuating the same brake from a different position, one where you typically have better leverage. I often find it hard to stop with the regular brake levers on bikes with old style drop levers like that.  edit: Ah, if im reading replies right, easier to pull the levers but harder to get any power out of them?"

bikewrench,36b0tw,Aun_vre,16,Sun May 17 22:44:52 2015 UTC,"They are called suicide levers because them they don't 'throw' enough cable to get full braking power. Meaning they don't move/actuate as far as the drop-bar brake levers. This happens because they bottom out on the flats of the bar.  Try it at home. Pull your 'cheater brake' and then see if you can move the drop bar brake closer to the bar. If you can move the drop bar lever after the cheater brake is fully depressed then you aren't getting the full power of the brake.   Modern ""interrupter"" or ""Cross Top"" lever solve this by being angled drastically away from the bar; preventing them from bottoming out.   example 1, example 2, example 3  Another in depth response to this question"

bikewrench,36d4cj,chrisstring,7,Mon May 18 12:54:12 2015 UTC,Your seat post is installed correctly.  Your seatpost uses a single bolt to adjust both fore/aft positioning and the angle of the saddle.  Loosen the bolt until you can adjust the angle; it may have to be loosened well past the point where you can slide the saddle forward and back. Many seatposts have notchings so the bolt has to be loosened enough that you can change what notch the clamps rest in.
bikewrench,36d4cj,Aaronplane,2,Mon May 18 13:12:03 2015 UTC,"Your seat post is not backwards. Sliding the seat forwards or backwards on the rails shouldn't affect the angle of it, just the position. To adjust the angle, there should be a screw on the underside of where the saddle rails join the seat post. Slacken that screw, adjust the angle, and then tighten it. Hope this helps."
bikewrench,36d4cj,nasdreg,1 point,Mon May 18 13:10:27 2015 UTC,Remove your seat post from your bike and turn your seat over and look at it. Loosen the one bolt you see. Now you can move the seat around as you like. The post is on correctly. The seat looks like its angled too high- especially for a girl.  #fixielife
bikewrench,36d4cj,safety3rd,0,Mon May 18 13:05:57 2015 UTC,"So I should slide it backwards until the seat is parallel with the ground, correct?"
bikewrench,36d4cj,safety3rd,2,Mon May 18 13:11:29 2015 UTC,"no- once you loosen the bolt, you can adjust the angle to the ground. The rails adjust forward and back positioning. Loosen the bolt and all will become apparent. Take it apart ans spend some time with it, because you may want to make minor adjustments to the position after you have it where you think you want it."

bikewrench,36bcno,gottaflash,2,Mon May 18 02:23:09 2015 UTC,"25mm is very wide rim. Most road rims that easily take 25s and 28s are around 14mm. You could pop 42s on there without issue. You might actually have problems with that narrow of a tire making a secure bead seat on a 25mm run. I would get something narrower if you want to run 28mm. Sheldon has a nice chart on rim/tire width compatibility. I'd link for you but I'm on mobile... and stoned.   Edit: /u/gottaflash is right, I didn't read your link. I thought your meant 25mm internal width. Like I said, stoned."

If not, you'll need a 24x37x7mm bearing which is pretty cheap.  I don't know exactly how a Gossamer is mounted but I'm guessing it's similar to Shimano cranksets.

bikewrench,369rbw,davisaggie314,3,Sun May 17 15:51:48 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing they're just friction shifters and will continue on that assumption.  Think about the system mechanically.  Rotating one of those tabs pulls a cable (or lets it out).  Follow the cable.  In either case, it moves down to the gear mechanism.  Now, watching the gear mechanism, see what happens when you move those tabs: the gear mechanism will move one direction or another.  All that is happening here is that the cable is pulling or letting out the gear mechanism.  In the direction that is ""harder"" or equivalently the one that goes to cogs with bigger teeth, you are applying force against a spring.  In the other direction, you are letting out cable and the mechanism returns to its desired position because of said spring.  The matter of shifting simply boils down to manually using that cable to put the derailleur into the correct position for the gear you want.  Thinking further about the mechanics of the system, you will realize that the front gears are such that a larger gear will be ""more difficult"" and the rear gears are such that a larger gear will be ""less difficult.""  The opposite tensioning front and back means that the directions for each behavior are opposite.  You make these adjustments according to your riding needs (e.g. terrain)."
bikewrench,369rbw,illustribox,3,Sun May 17 16:48:27 2015 UTC,"Assuming you have either downtube or stem shifters and that everything is hooked up properly, then the right controls the rear, probably five gears and the left controls the front two. For every day use most people keep the front shifter on the smaller ring and run through the rear gears as they pick up speed or approach inclines. You'll get a feel for it as you go.  The other thing to be mindful of is that your shifters are almost certainly what is referred to as friction shifters, meaning they don't click into each individual gear. You may need to make small adjustments to the rear shifter in either direction in order to quiet the racket that occurs when the derailleur finds itself between two gears.

bikewrench,3683qt,aleslie22,2,Mon May 18 16:27:58 2015 UTC,"Happy to help.  The goal of the cleaning is to make your bike last longer and work better. You are cleaning out the grit in the drivetrain that wears the parts. Cleaning also forces you to touch and examine nearly every part of your bike. You will discover things that might be bent or broken while they are still small problems. It's much easier to repair these issues at home instead of having them fail dramatically or even catastrophically on the road.   I know people who clean their bikes after every 50 miles of use. I think that's extreme. I clean mine after every 200 miles or after a ride in the rain. I know people who think that's extreme. Maybe it is. Here's a rule of thumb: grab your chain. If it leaves a dark brown smear on your hands, you're fine. If the smear is black, clean it!  First, the list of stuff you need:   Clean rags, about a dozen. Absorbent and stretchy is good. Rags from T-shirts are perfect. Degreasing solvent. Don't buy this in pint bottles from a bike shop. It will cost a fortune. Buy it in bulk as a cleaning supply, like this. It's the exact same stuff, and costs a fraction of what a bike store charges. A chain cleaning tool. Compressed air, like this. I buy these in bulk from Costco, and they cost much less. These are optional, but I adore my fancy bike brushes. They are handy for cleaning the nooks and crannies rags can't reach.  Also optional, but boy does it make working on your bike easy: a bike stand. You don't have to buy one. There are lots of homebrew versions.   This is how I clean my bike:   From top to bottom, brush or wipe with a rag all the dirt and crud on the seat and the frame. Wet the rag with solvent when necessary. Doing this top to bottom is important, because you don't want crap to rain down on what you just cleaned. Pay particular attention to the bottom of the seat and the bottom of your down tube and your stays. Dirt tends to fly up at a bike from the road surface, so the undersides are usually the dirtiest. Brush or wipe your shifters and your brakes.  On your brakes, use compressed air to blow out any grit the rags or brushes can't reach. Inspect your brake pads. They will usually be just fine, but if you notice lots of wear, replace them. (Once you are in the habit of inspecting them often, you'll know what ""lots of wear"" means.) Brush or wipe your rims, spokes, and hubs. Take this moment to turn the wheel with your bare hand brushing the tire. You are feeling for sharp bits of stone, fragments of wire, or glass shards that may be stuck in your tire but haven't pierced your tube yet. Pull these out. If you have any concern the tire was compromised, mark the spot on the tire hub with a red sharpie. Carry a spare tire with you when you bike instead of just a tube. Monitor the spot until it fails or you aren't concerned anymore.  Clean your chain with the chain cleaner. Wipe it dry with clean rags. Remove your rear wheel. Clean the cassette with rags and solvent until it all looks like bare metal, like this. Rub or brush away all the black crud on your pulleys.  Wipe or brush your rear derailleur. Use compressed air to blow out the dirty bits you can't wipe. Do the same for your front derailleur.  Brush or wipe your cranks and rings. Be careful about getting solvent in the crack between your bottom bracket shell and your cranks. You don't want degreasing solvent to seep inside your bottom bracket and mess with the lube in there. Put your rear wheel back on.  Pour out the grungy, dirty solvent from your chain cleaner. Wipe it out and pour in fresh, clean solvent. Clean your chain again. Wipe your chain dry with a rag. Wipe it again with a second rag.  Congrats! Clean bike. You are ready to lube your drive train. Some people are dogmatic about using very little lube, just a couple of drops, and some people are just as dogmatic about using lots of lube, drowning the chain in it. I'm in the middle. I liberally apply drops while the chain turns through one revolution. It works for me.   Now ride, ride like the wind!"

The mechanic said that with this kind of damage, people in the past have gone 50/50 on getting a new bike, or just replacing the parts.

While many frames that are damaged may ""let you know"", if OP isn't a particularly experienced or attentive rider the thing that might let him/her know is finding themselves suddenly ass-over-applecart in the ditch.  If the mechanic checking over the bike didn't find anything, that doesn't mean OP is in the clear. I'm surprised the mechanic didn't check for any frame alignment issues that would indicate damage. It only takes a couple of minutes and would yield a more positive answer than eyeballing the frame.  Was there any damage to other parts of the bike? Did it knock your wheel out of true? Bend  the derailleur hanger? These things should have been checked by your mechanic when you told them that your bike hit the deck (not saying they weren't but I see no mention of them), and would help you or the mechanic asses how concerned they should be about frame damage or anything else hard-to-spot.  Either way, you're smart to be concerned about your bike after a crash.

bikewrench,364kil,Zbinxsy,2,Sat May 16 02:04:25 2015 UTC,i can't tell the difference between slx and xt as far as power and feel go. The best and cheapest way to get more power is to use bigger rotors. Try a 180 in the front if you have a 160 now.
bikewrench,364kil,shittypromech,1 point,Sat May 16 03:45:06 2015 UTC,would upgrading to ice tec rotors and fined pads help? Im new to having  MTB... I have a Anthem so I already have a 180 up front. I can talk your ear off about the differences between all the mountain stuff and why this or that is better. But I didn't start riding it till like a month ago. So i can only assume the ice tec rotors are stiffer and offer better braking power. Well thats what I tell people...
bikewrench,364kil,CertifiedUser,1 point,Sat May 16 03:47:16 2015 UTC,"You want more power, or more modulation? Or are you finding that they're not as powerful after riding for awhile? Want more power? Buy some Zee Calipers and mate them to your SLX levers. All Deore, SLX, XT, XTR, Saint, Zee use the same high-flow hose and are all compatible with each other. The cheapest solution to getting more power from Shimano brakes is swapping to metal pads from the stock resin pads. Want more modulation? Swap to SRAM Guides, offer the same power with decent modulation that doesn't ramp up like Shimanos do, which is due to the servo-wave that Shimano use. Losing power on descents or after riding? That's brake fade. Due to your pads/disks not cooling down fast enough. Larger rotors and finned pads will help disperse more heat. Spider-ed rotors (like Ice-Techs) are less likely to bend, however, aluminum rotors bend under even moderate braking. The steel/al/steel press that the Ice-Techs use seems to be the best of both worlds. Or are you just upgrading for the sake of upgrading?"

bikewrench,364kil,sporkfly,2,Tue May 19 03:36:32 2015 UTC,The only difference between slx and xt is the (useless) free stroke adjustment and a bolt rather than a split pin holding the pads in.

bikewrench,364kil,sporkfly,1 point,Sat May 16 14:51:54 2015 UTC,"So, the only difference between SLX and XT/XTR levers is that the pad retaining bolt (caliper end, of course) threads in rather than being a split pin, and the free stroke adjustment.  The free stroke is rarely used by most people, and the split pin vs. bolt at the caliper isn't a make or break. The lever feel and performance of the brakes will be virtually identical. Keep the SLX, or maybe you just don't like how Shimano perform and you should consider a different system. My 0.02.

If it rolls well on the crown race then its prob going to roll smoothly in the lower cup.

We put the biggest cheater bar possible on the wrench itself, and I braced the wheel with my body weight against the base of the service counter while two other people operated the chain whip and the wrench.   Never say never."

bikewrench,3629ld,georgekeele,1 point,Fri May 15 18:04:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, rattlegun fixes everything. Hell even the chainwhip is optional. But be aware that the tools are not really meant to go in an impact, so do wear proper eye protection in the event something gives up the ghost.  ATF and acetone 50/50 mix is the best penetrating oil I've used. Preheat the cassette, remove flame and douse the threads with the mix and let sit for a beer. I'd hit it with the impact at this point. May be more cost effective to go to a shop if you don't have all of the ingredients in the garage.  Edit: youtubed uniglide cassette removal. I would wedge the big sprocket and use an air hammer with a dull bit on the small. After doing a good heat and treat with penetrating oil."

I know you don't want to hear it, but I think a freewheel replacement wheel and new 6 speed freewheel would be a good fix for this. Other than that all I can suggest is trying it again with the two chain whips keeping them angled close together for best leverage, or maybe cutting the last cog off with a dremel and cutting wheel."

bikewrench,3629ld,kinboyatuwo,0,Fri May 15 19:16:59 2015 UTC,99% you are screwed. Only last ditch effort I would try is a vice. Use the wheel as leverage and put the cog clamped in the vice. I have seen it used once.   Steel on steel is the issue. Most likely now the materials are bonded and you are not getting them apart.
bikewrench,3629ld,chock-a-block,3,Fri May 15 15:53:57 2015 UTC,"< 50% chance you are screwed. The vice is the right solution.  -get the right tools for the job.  I think Park still makes the hex-faced freewheel remover tool.  A vice bolted to the floor.  -use the QR (no springs) to hold the freewheel removal tool in place.  -put the freewheel tool in the vice and make it tight.  -turn the wheel counter-clockwise at the rim.  (I think.  It's been over a decade) It'll break loose.  It will probably groan and creak along the way before letting go.  Chain whips are useful for freehubs/cassettes, not freewheels."
bikewrench,3629ld,kinboyatuwo,0,Fri May 15 18:02:45 2015 UTC,Depends. Some uniglide are locked down by the last ring. Those can be seized beyond salvage.  I have also broken several of the tools you describe.  Some just will not come off. Source: 94-2000 as a bike mechanic.

bikewrench,361sl6,elementsix,3,Fri May 15 11:23:24 2015 UTC,"1) Brake cleaner is for removing brake dust from automotive brakes.  Stop using it on your bicycle.  Use rubbing alcohol and a clean rag.  2) ""noise"" doesn't really tell me anything.  Grinding?  Squealing? Rubbing?  Swishing?  You know, what kind of noise?  That makes a huge difference.  Also, I'm unclear if your issue is simply the pads not grabbing or the lever being too mushy to make the pads grab.  You might need a brake bleed (and for fucksake if you do bleed, take your pads out first).  You can tell if you need a bleed by lever feel.  3) you don't need to sand your discs.  4) break-in of disc brakes involves several repeated uses of the brakes to come to an almost complete stop (but not a full stop).  This deposits pad material onto the rotor.  When you sanded the rotor, you removed all this and the brakes are now at their weakest state (short of maybe having lube on them).  5) at this point, since you've already tried sanding pads and used the wrong kind of cleaner, you can assume your system is largely contaminated and your best bet is to first of all remove the wheel from the bike and very thoroughly clean the rotor with alcohol and a clean rag.  While the wheel is off, remove the brake pads and throw them in the trash.  Now spray alcohol all around in the caliper to clean out any potential contaminants and install new brake pads (don't touch the pad material with ANYTHING greasy, including your fingers).  Reinstall and perform a quick break-in and you should note that it's all better now, unless the caliper is misaligned or you managed to put the wheel in crooked."
bikewrench,361sl6,nhluhr,2,Fri May 15 11:35:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry, it's early in the morning, let me clarify. I followed this guide:  http://www.pinkbike.com/news/Tech-Tuesday-Silence-That-Squeaky-Disc-Brake-2011.html  and I did not use anything but sandpaper on the pads. As someone who works on cars I know the way to handle pads and rotors. My fingers never touched any surface.  As for feel while at speed I pull down and get very little braking. The lever doesn't go right to the bar (again, car experience I know what no/low/bad brake fluid feels like) but very 'dull'. At the very peak of the braking sequence I get a howl/squeal. Loud enough that you would hear me coming down a descent."

bikewrench,35wbsx,p4lm3r,0,Fri May 15 04:20:43 2015 UTC,bottom brackets are threaded all the way through in one direction. Your BB looks like it is threading itself out. Probably due to lack of service. It is now hung up on the crank. Put your bb back.
bikewrench,35wbsx,pipeanddrum,1 point,Thu May 14 01:56:22 2015 UTC,Should I pull it all the way out to check the threading and grease it? Or just tighten it back up?
bikewrench,35wbsx,Jamaican_In_NY,2,Thu May 14 02:10:53 2015 UTC,"I would take it out, clean up the bb and the shell, and all the threads.  Look out for shiny metal slivers, and use a an old toothbrush.  then put it back together.  With grease."
bikewrench,35wbsx,Bobatt,1 point,Thu May 14 07:08:03 2015 UTC,"I'm going to front a theory: Your bottom bracket bearing is bad on that side, seizing the crank. When you pedaled backwards, you effectively unscrewed the bottom bracket cup on that side."
bikewrench,35wbsx,Jamaican_In_NY,1 point,Thu May 14 15:04:03 2015 UTC,"The left hand side of an English BB is a right hand thread, meaning that it unscrews counter clockwise.  Unless I'm badly misunderstanding things, pedaling backwards with a seized bearing would tighten the cup."
bikewrench,35wbsx,Jamaican_In_NY,0,Thu May 14 17:35:41 2015 UTC,No you got it right; I had it wrong.   So it's more likely the bottom bracket seized and just in pedaling forward the bracket screwed out.
bikewrench,35wbsx,mikefitzvw,0,Thu May 14 20:22:03 2015 UTC,This is not correct. The bottom bracket cups thread in opposite directions from either side.  Drive side:  Righty tighty lefty loosey  Non-drive side: Exact opposite.
bikewrench,35wbsx,Jamaican_In_NY,2,Thu May 14 14:08:18 2015 UTC,It's the opposite.  Non-drive (adjustable) side - lefty loosey.  Drive side - righty-loosey.  Opposite of the pedals.

bikewrench,35wbsx,horsebacon,-4,Thu May 14 17:48:24 2015 UTC,The bb threads are uniform all the way through. That's what makes it possible to chase a bb if you have damaged threads on one side.

bikewrench,35wtpz,lavaslippers,4,Thu May 14 04:13:03 2015 UTC,You can always use the tried and true zip ties. BTW most hydro brake systems allow for the hose to be shortened without having to bleed. Any new brakes come pre bled and most have rotors included.

bikewrench,35wtpz,aedrin,2,Thu May 14 18:08:31 2015 UTC,You will need hydraulic hose cutters. They are like a cigar cutter with a sharp as hell razor blade. They insure a clean cut. You can always try a new razor blade but you could cut it at an angle. Having a clean cut is going to determine if it will form a good seal or leak fluid/come disconnected. Probably a good idea to have a bleed kit for your first time anyways. Maybe watch a few youtube videos and get a feel for it. Also happy to answer any questions.
bikewrench,35wtpz,aedrin,1 point,Thu May 14 18:17:11 2015 UTC,Thanks! I looked them up on CRC. Their least expensive one is $15 (cdn) while the other two are around $100 to $125! Please tell me there's no reason to buy the ridiculous priced ones. (I can't afford to anyway). Would a razor flat across a vice holding the hose in the plastic block that came with the brake kit work?
bikewrench,35wtpz,aedrin,2,Thu May 14 18:22:02 2015 UTC,I've used the avid hose cutter for a while. Its like 20. It could work. Just more likely to cut diagonal than perfectly horizontal. this one http://www.amazon.com/Avid-Hand-Hydraulic-Cutter-Black/dp/B004EZOVWU

bikewrench,35u80g,tyrroi,4,Wed May 13 15:32:34 2015 UTC,"Again, as mentioned in r/bicycling, we need a picture. Theres a lot of factors that can cause this. One of them is that the new brake pads have a film on them and they need to be worn off in order to stop. Another is the pads got contaminated during the bleed."
bikewrench,35u80g,AgentDaedalus,1 point,Wed May 13 15:41:14 2015 UTC,I've made sure to clean everything with alcohol so there shouldn't be a problem with contamination. What would you need a picture of? I could get some but I don't know if it would really help.
bikewrench,35u80g,Turbobaker4,7,Wed May 13 16:12:24 2015 UTC,"Alcohol is good for cleaning the rotor, but the pads are porous.  The fluid will soak into them and contaminate them.  Alcohol will not fix this."
bikewrench,35u80g,AgentDaedalus,1 point,Wed May 13 17:54:24 2015 UTC,I'm thinking you might have contaminated your pads/rotor. Is there a loud grinding sound when you brake?
bikewrench,35u80g,AgentDaedalus,1 point,Wed May 13 16:20:50 2015 UTC,"It does make a loud squeak when braking yes, but I have new pads and a new disc now and it does the same thing."
bikewrench,35u80g,AgentDaedalus,1 point,Wed May 13 16:28:20 2015 UTC,So did you bleed them before or after the change. Did you bleed them properly? Did you add enough mineral oi/brake fluid? Are the pads bedded correctly?

bikewrench,35u80g,ubrayj02,2,Wed May 13 17:36:38 2015 UTC,"And do you know if you got any fluid on the pads? Just a bit on the pads can mess it up, as they are porous, and soak it up like a sponge. If you did, you need to remove it somehow. I found that soaking it in like 99% alcohol and then getting them really hot (on a pan, fire, etc), seems to work. It only worked on some old Shimano pads, and the new ones, it doesn't seem to work anymore."
bikewrench,35u80g,madmtb541,3,Wed May 13 17:57:13 2015 UTC,Did you bed them properly? Does one brake have way more lever travel than the other?
bikewrench,35u80g,Karlemagne,1 point,Wed May 13 16:30:49 2015 UTC,"The front does seem to go further in than the back, I put that down to bleeding them."
bikewrench,35u80g,Budkazz,2,Wed May 13 16:33:35 2015 UTC,"Hydraulic disc levers usually have a way of adjusting for pad travel. Have you tried adjusting this? I bled a set of Avid brakes this week and forgot to back the pads away from the rotor (done at the lever) and couldn't get one of the brakes to work right after bleeding it, twice. Then I slapped my forehead, backed the pads off the rotor, bled the brakes, moved the pads closer to the rotor, and everything works perfectly."
bikewrench,35u80g,photonoobie,2,Thu May 14 03:06:28 2015 UTC,"sounds like you've ruled out contamination, so it might seem obvious, and maybe your particular breaks don't have this, but on a lot of tektro brake calipers there is a pad adjustment on the caliper,  so perhaps your pads are too far apart. if you don't have that, try to take the wheel off the bike, and very gently squeeze the lever to move the pads closer together. also make sure your caliper is centered. while the wheel is installed, loosen the bolts, squeeze the brake and then tighten the bolts while squeezing.  this should center everything.  you can also do this by eye, by loosening the bolts and slowly spinning the wheel until you have perfect pad/rotor spacing."
bikewrench,35u80g,Vojta7,2,Wed May 13 18:35:00 2015 UTC,"Especially when installing new brakes, I have found that this has typically been my problem. By design, disc brakes don't move very much when you pull your levers so everything needs to well-centered and the clearance between the brake pads and disc should be pretty small. This normally takes me a few tries, but it's worth it.  Another thing is that (at least for me) even new discs tend to need some gentle correction in order to spin true. Once again, even a small wobble is significant if it keeps you from getting your brake pads as close as they need to be."
bikewrench,35u80g,tinnedspicedham,1 point,Thu May 14 03:22:44 2015 UTC,Have you burnished the new pads and rotor? New brakes don't have a ton of stopping power until you deposit some pad material onto the rotor to give it some bite.
bikewrench,35u80g,Zbinxsy,1 point,Thu May 14 01:13:17 2015 UTC,"I've found that some of the Tektro brakes need a little bit of 'extra' fluid when bleeding them in order to bring the pads closer to the disc.  After you've gone through the proper bleeding procedure, close the bleed screw at the lever, and use the syringe to push a little more fluid into the caliper end of the system.  Then, while pressing on the syringe plunger, close the caliper bleed screw to close the system.  How hard you need to press, and how much extra fluid you push into the system is difficult to describe, so some experimentation may be necessary."

bikewrench,35u04p,pikeamus,29,Wed May 13 14:28:56 2015 UTC,"Both are right, in different cases.  Doctor is right if the chain isn't well past it's life. Running a chain too long will accelerate the wear of a cassette. If you replace them at the right time, you can wear through 2-3 chains before you wear through a cassette.   Dalek is correct if the chain is well past its lifespan, because in that case, what the Doctor warned you about has already happened. And running a fresh chain on a worn cassette will cause shifting problems and chain skipping. You won't usually experience skipping from running a chain too long, because they're wearing into each other together. It's when you replace one but not the other at that point do you get the skipping.  Who you should listen to will depend on just how worn that chain is."
bikewrench,35u04p,D0rk4L,8,Wed May 13 14:31:29 2015 UTC,"So would you say that the right thing to do is to replace the chain first, and then get a new cassette if the new chain causes skipping?"

bikewrench,35u04p,D0rk4L,3,Wed May 13 15:58:03 2015 UTC,"The right thing to do is get a chain measuring tool. Depending on how well the chain is cared for, expect 1250 to 2000 miles between chains and 3 to 4 chains before a new cassette."
bikewrench,35u04p,dura-ace,7,Wed May 13 22:25:09 2015 UTC,"no need for a tool. chains are 1"" pitch meaning it is exactly 1/2"" between the center points of two adjacent pins. take a 12"" ruler and if the center of the 24th link is at the 24-1/16"" mark or beyond it's time to replace."

At my shop, if a chain is worn, we will generally try a new one out on the old cassette before replacing the cassette, too. If it gives us problems on a test ride, we'll replace the cassette. You should definitely replace the chain if it is worn, and if you need to, replace the cassette as well. Dalek may be right, but following his advice wouldn't be the best long-term solution."
bikewrench,35u04p,dura-ace,2,Wed May 13 14:41:01 2015 UTC,Ill add that continuing to run a well worn chain risks the replacement of the chainrings as well as cassette. An even more expensive proposition.

bikewrench,35u04p,SpamDog_of_War,3,Wed May 13 21:25:05 2015 UTC,"At the shop I associate replacing the chain w/ replacing the oil in your car.  It is basic maintenance that will drastically extend the life of your drivetrain.  Typically chains last around 1,500 miles before they need to be replaced (some, like campy, last a lot longer and with good lubing you can extend that).  W/ regular chain replacement you typically can get 4-5 chains out of a cassette.  W/O regular chain replacement and if you put a ton of miles on your chain you can really wear out certain gears on your cassette which would mean it needs to be replaced."

Has never been on a plane or bus either?  You can get metal brake lines for bikes as well.

bikewrench,35vfo2,wobbletabble,3,Wed May 13 21:04:22 2015 UTC,"Any Campy 10-speed shifter will work, as will a 9-speed ergo shifter. You just have to match the shifter with an appropriate cassette.  Be aware though, there is a big difference between the lower-tier and higher-tier Campy lines when it comes to shifters: Chorus and above will shift across many gears in one push (I think it's 3 upshift or 5 downshift), versus Athena and below will do significantly less (1 up/3down). I'm not 100% sure on the numbers btw, but they're roughly right."
bikewrench,35suiz,phinnaeus7308,3,Wed May 13 05:37:47 2015 UTC,"I built up a Scott Speedster frame with Ultegra components last year (I wanted an 11 speed bike with aluminium for potentially greater longevity than carbon) and I did learn a lot and really enjoyed the process. The most important thing I discovered is that you need access to, or be willing to buy a lot of specific tools to get the job done properly. I also don't see a headset or a saddle post clamp on your list. Edit: just took a look at the frameset and I see the clamp and headset are included"
bikewrench,35suiz,beware_the_cagers,2,Wed May 13 06:05:22 2015 UTC,Having built a campy set myself I'd suggest getting the chorus shifters as you get ultra shift (in a nutshell you can upshift multiple gears in one motion) .  Also I'd really recommended the campy cables they're expensive I know but they do make the operational compliances much better as they are very low resistance. They're coated as well which is a plus for your frame which has exposed cables.
bikewrench,35suiz,Fuchsie,1 point,Wed May 13 08:40:23 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I'll shop around for some Chorus shifters. Will I need to get ultra shift derailleurs, too?  Are these the good quality Campy cables you're referring to?"

bikewrench,35suiz,igiveyoumehs,2,Wed May 13 14:38:16 2015 UTC,"First thing first - I've never heard of a frame that can handle calipers and disc brakes (cantis and discs, yes). It doesn't mean they don't exist, but I'd be sure to double check.  Wheelsets that are compatible with both discs and rim brakes are pretty rare, and most likely will be designed for mountain bikes. Road discs are still relatively new. Those wheels you linked look to be disc specific. It could be done pretty easily with a custom wheelset, though (IE, buy the rim, spokes, and hub separately).  As for tools, there are a couple posts on this sub that tackle that, already.  here: http://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/1lc8cf/which_tools_to_buy/  and here: http://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/3083jm/rather_new_to_working_on_my_bike_and_not_sure/  among others."

bikewrench,35suiz,hypnoderp,2,Wed May 13 14:04:28 2015 UTC,"I think that's a good idea.  To answer your question about brake compatibility:  Wheels have to have a braking surface on the rim to handle calipers, and have to have a reinforced hub with bolt holes to handle a disc rotor.  Wheels that are disc only don't have to have the square rim profile to accommodate a braking surface, they just usually have a more rounded or a 'v' shape that focuses on strength.  Might as well get disc rims and disc brakes.  The other thing is that the levers that actuate the two different systems are often different, as they have different leverage to accommodate the different modulation each system offers.  Disc brakes are far superior in all categories except weight.  In my opinion the superior performance outweighs this penalty.  Might as well save yourself the headache and go disc right away.  Make sure you get the right brakes for the mount your frame has.  Likely road discs, which have a slightly lower diameter rotor.  Avid makes a wonderful line of great value for money cable-actuated discs.  I've run many discs and they've been my favourite.    Best of luck with the build, it looks like it'll be beautiful."

bikewrench,35suiz,PM_ME_YOUR_BlCYCLE,1 point,Wed May 13 17:27:04 2015 UTC,"Make sure you also use good quality housing for those brake cables.  You don't want the housing to compress at all, especially when you're running disc brakes on a big frame.  Jagwire is a good brand.  Also, lube the cables before you run them so they slide nicely.  More power straight to the brakes is finer control and better stopping.  Happy building!"
bikewrench,35tufw,nimbusnacho,9,Wed May 13 13:39:27 2015 UTC,"Drilling out a rim to fit a schrader valve is not a big deal.  Your tube doesn't need to fit in the rim so much as the tube needs to fit the tire and the tire needs to fit the rim.    What size rim, tire and tube are you using?     What kind of flats are you getting?  You might just have some bad luck if it's from road or trail debris, it could be pinch flats from not enough pressure or you could have a tire that isn't really intended to fit the rim you have.    Taping up the current valve hole and drilling a new one is not the best idea.  You can get a gromet or spacer to drop into the schrader sized hole to make it fit snug with a presta valve and not have extra holes covered with tape in your rims."
bikewrench,35tufw,Seanbikes,1 point,Wed May 13 14:22:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the info. Legitimately thought that drilling out a bigger hole was a bigger deal than it probably is, because of random internet info and it seems inaccurately associating the problems I'm having with the hole.  Rim is 700Cx23 I believe (bike's not in front of me) and tire/tube are 700Cx28. From the comments I'm thinking maybe a smaller size tire/tube might help the rim seating properly. I had read online that 23 wide rims would be fine with 28 wide tires so I didn't think of that until all of these comments. It always just seemed like the seating problems were from the thicker part of the tube that surrounds the schrader valve just didn't leave room for the tire to sit.  As far as the flats, I think they're pinch flats from the tire not sitting right around the valve. Either that or the 2 times I tried just using a presta valved tube, it was right at the valve because it obviously bulged out of the extra wide hole. Speaking of which, do you happen to have a link to the grommet or spacer that would work? This is what I bought, but it doesn't fit on the inside hole for the valve in a way that would prevent those flats. http://www.amazon.com/Schrader-Presta-Rubber-Rim-Hole-Adaptor/dp/B000XNZU1S/ref=pd_ybh_3"

bikewrench,35tufw,senoritaoscar,3,Thu May 14 18:27:43 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me that you're describing a situation that has more to do with tire/rim interface. It's no big deal to drill out for schrader and doesn't really affect the strength of the rim. ""The tire bead around the valve won't sit where it's supposed to"" sounds like an installation issue. When you reinstall the tire, you generally have to seat the tire bead around the valve area by gently pushing the valve up and squeezing the tire bead in so that the tube is sitting over the tire bead. Also, check to make sure your tubes are the right size for the tires. There's also a chance that the rim is too narrow for the tires you're using."
bikewrench,35tufw,ramennoodle,3,Wed May 13 14:46:23 2015 UTC,"I'm a little surprised that the mechanic went and drilled out your rim before recommending a different tube. While it's not that big a deal, I definitely wouldn't do this to a customer."

bikewrench,35tufw,MrMoar,0,Wed May 13 13:58:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, kinda late to buy it after the guy at the shop drilled the hole. Sorry if I didn't make that clear. When I was buying the wheel, the guy just decided to drill the whole wider instead of just explaining to me that I would need a new innertube with a different valve. (I had asked for a wheel that would take schrader valves since I just bought a bunch of schrader innertubes, and I think after he unpacked and started installing the wheel he realized it was for a presta and that's how he decided to solve the situation). I definitely would have just bought the correct innertube had I known better.  I'm going to try buying new tires that will hopefully fit better. Thanks for the suggestion."

(2) You were fucked from the beginning.  The strength of a wheel has little to do with the rim if it's built correctly.  Your wheel was going out of true mainly because the tension was not high enough in the spokes.  It would have been cheaper to buy a decent spoke key and tighten things yourself - it's not hard (or the bike shop could have done so, but they wouldn't have made as much from it as selling you a wheel).  (3) The tyre bead seating doesn't have much to do with the type of valve on the inner tube.  It sounds like there's a problem with the rim or your tyres, or you're not doing things right when you put the tyre back.  Inflate the inner enough just to make it not floppy, then put the tyre on, then inflate a little more and ground the entire wheel making sure the bead is right (pulling the tyre off the rim slightly and then letting it seat)."

To answer your question about the shifter - there ARE 3 positions, but I noticed (like you) that it's hard to get into the lowest one.  According to other volunteers far older than me, you must be coasting or backpedalling to shift one of these hubs.  I did notice, upon my final test-ride, that I could shift between all 3 gears easily when costing or backpedaling, but not while stopped.    The oil I was given to rebuild the hub was 10W-30 automotive oil.  That might actually be a good choice to put in yours as well.  The multi-grade oil won't gum up in cold temperatures, or get too thin in warm temperatures.   Feel free to ask any questions.  Sturmey-Archer still sells the cable and the shifter (heck, the whole hub too) on their website, should you need replacements."

There's a couple of nuts on this bike that are rusted, can they be found at places like home depot or are bike nuts specially sized?   There's a couple of them that wouldn't fit my set of wrenches. So I used a pair of pliers and I stripped the nut a bit. I'd like to replace it.   Also, one of my mud flaps on the back wheel is all dull silver, and the other is like shiny chrome.

I tried these, and found it to work fine with a mallet and a block.  There was a stage where it looked just like yours and it went in fine.  I understand the frustration to want to do it yourself.

bikewrench,35stp6,miraoister,2,Wed May 13 05:28:00 2015 UTC,"You probably need a new chain, a new cog (or cassette/freewheel, if you have gears hidden back there), and maybe a new chainring, too. Chains mostly come in the same length, which is almost always enough for a standard bike. What you'll need to know is how many speeds you have on the rear wheel.  When a chain breaks, its usually because its pretty worn out. That being the case, your cog/cassette/freewheel in the rear is worn out, too, and most likely the chainring, as well.  For a single-speed or fixed setup, you can get away with just replacing the chain. With the correct tension, your drivetrain will work ok for a little while. With gears, a new chain will most likely just slip over the cogs.  Either way, a worn drivetrain will wear out a new chain faster than normal, which gets you back to where you are now."

However doing B. will look waaaaaaaaaaaaay better, but you are losing material and also adding wear to the part.  I wouldn't bother with anodizing though, that's pretty involved for something that might not look any better.  I'd vote for B - make that crank shiny!"
bikewrench,35phdh,stanspaceman,2,Tue May 12 13:45:32 2015 UTC,Yeah I am leaning most towards B except I don't know if it will also look like crap after its first day out on the road. The crank is in great condition with no hairline cracks in the corner or anything so I'm not worried about it's integrity if it loses 1/10th of a mm of material here and there to take out scratches.
bikewrench,35phdh,stanspaceman,6,Tue May 12 13:48:04 2015 UTC,"Actually, a well polished material will repel dirt better than something with a bit of texture to it. In terms of it getting scratched up again as you ride it, that's inevitable."

There's no longer any play in the one that's installed since they tightened and lubed everything but I was still planning on going to get it replaced.

The hub has caused issues many times before (my rims are quite worn so I can't be arsed to replace the hub until I swap the entire wheelset) so that's my best bet, if it isn't the headset.  Taking apart a Shimano front hub is quite simple too, so it's no big deal. I'm bad at at it, and it's still only a 10-15 minute job.

bikewrench,35nwnj,joethehoe27,1 point,Tue May 12 12:49:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that would work.  Those (certainly home owners insurance, anyway) have very high deductibles (e.g. $2000).   They may already cover bike theft.   But if you want a much smaller deductible it might be better to get a separate policy rather than pay the increased premiums to reduce the deductible on home owner's insurance.  EDIT:  However, home owner's insurance also covers other things you may not expect.  For example, if someone steals stuff from your car your car insurance will only cover damage to the vehicle.  The stolen possessions are typically covered by home owners insurance.  However, that is often useless given the high deductible.   So maybe paying to lower the deductible for home owner's insurance might be worth it even if it costs more than getting a separate bicycle policy.  And your bank will escrow that shit for you.

bikewrench,35n7hb,jhenry922,1 point,Mon May 11 21:54:55 2015 UTC,"The lubricants inside the shock have either dried up or run out, and its possible also that the seals have deteriorated. I'm not familiar with DT Swiss suspension but it is usually possible to get seal kits and rebuild it. Otherwise take it into a MTB-focused LBS."
bikewrench,35luey,gnarly,4,Mon May 11 15:51:10 2015 UTC,"This setup works perfectly (easily as good as the stock mech and cassette) for me on two bikes. I did have some issues getting set up though.   First question: Do you have a long enough chain? If there's enough resistance when going up to the top cog that everything stops turning, it suggests that perhaps your chain is too short. As /u/onespeeder suggests, try a little bit more B-tension. Add a quarter of a turn at a time and see if it improves things. On one of the bikes, I needed a new inner and outer gear cable. A big part of the problem was gunge in the outer cable stopping everything from shifting properly. One of the bikes turned out to have a slightly bent mech-hanger - so subtle it was barely visible! A new one massively improved things. That was causing issues at either end of the cassette, but shifting through the middle four gears was perfect."
bikewrench,35luey,bicycleroad,2,Mon May 11 16:26:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions.  Point by point:   I installed a new chain and used the standard chain sizing method I'd seen in a few places (around biggest cog + front ring w/o derailleur, add links).  This worked when I initially swapped over to 1x, so I think it should be alright now. When say to ""add"" B tension, do you mean that I should be getting the upper pulley closer or further away from the cog?  Basically I adjusted the B-tension until there was contact between the pulley/cassette, then backed off from there until it didn't make noise. This is definitely an option, but the cable housing is only ~6 months old so I figured it would be good for a little longer. I actually swapped out my rear mech hanger when doing this work.  I had previously bent and straightened it, but it looked funky when I was working on the bike so I swapped it out for the spare."
bikewrench,35luey,gnarly,2,Mon May 11 16:56:10 2015 UTC,Check that the spare is straight as often they are bent/not aligned perfectly out of the box.
bikewrench,35luey,Plantemanden,2,Mon May 11 21:09:52 2015 UTC,"I installed a new chain...   Silly question - is it the right way around? Shimano chains are directional - IIRC the writing on them should face outwards.   When say to ""add"" B tension, do you mean that I should be getting the upper pulley closer or further away from the cog?    Move the upper pulley further away from the cog - just a little bit at a time to see if it helps. Don't go too far though, or it will adversely affect shifting at the other end of the cassette.   the cable housing is only ~6 months old    ...and you've just been through the winter :) You could try disconnecting the cable from the mech and making sure it moves smoothly through the housing to make sure."

bikewrench,35luey,onespeeder,2,Mon May 11 16:42:41 2015 UTC,"Any kind of resistance. See how far you're going on the l limit screw, and how the derailleur reacts when you hit that big gear."
bikewrench,35luey,gnarly,1 point,Tue May 12 04:10:03 2015 UTC,"Although this may not be the most helpful comment for helping the dude in his current situation, it is the exact reason I only went 40t on the back on both my 1x10 conversions. Smooth as butter with the 40."
bikewrench,35luey,nhluhr,1 point,Mon May 11 15:54:19 2015 UTC,"Not to sound like an ass, but that isn't particularly helpful.  Many people have installed 42t cogs on 10-speed derailleurs without many problems.  I'm also not terribly interested in spending $85 on a 40t cog when the one I purchased is, according to OneUp and other folks, supposed to work on my bike."
bikewrench,35luey,gnarly,2,Mon May 11 18:53:30 2015 UTC,"You probably need more b tension. I have the e13 42t cog with a Rad cage on SLX and I have no problems getting into the 42. But it took more b tension than I thought it would.   I have 2 converted bikes with 42's, and they both work fine. I have said it before: adjustment is crucial."
bikewrench,35luey,nhluhr,1 point,Mon May 11 16:02:02 2015 UTC,"In my (admittedly limited) experience, I've found shifting with 40T on an unmodded SRAM RD is butter smooth, but Shimano is another story entirely. I could have good shifting at either end of the cassette but not all the way across it.   The OneUp RAD cage sorted that out for me - and continued to work perfectly when I fitted the 42t."
bikewrench,35luey,cleansoap,1 point,Mon May 11 16:12:49 2015 UTC,"You are totally correct.  The ability of a derailleur to shift to bigger cogs actually had nothing to do with the length of the cage.  Cage length is what provides max gear range capacity, not max dog size limit.  So the fact that oneUp only includes a cage tells you that hey haven't really engineered their solution to the cog size limit of the derailleur.  The difference that allows a derailleur to shift to larger cogs is also not just the b tension screw, since if you just turn that in a bunch, you end up with less chain wrap and poor shifting on the smaller cogs.  Instead, the length of the parallelogram linkage is longer and the angle of the knuckle that parallelogram bolts to is clocked very slightly.  Together, these make the upper (guide) pulley follow the longer, steeper line needed to both stay close to smaller cogs and also provide clearance to larger cogs.  Here's a diagram.  Although it is for a road setup choosing between SS and GS derailleurs, the concept is the same and it will help to further visualize the difference:  http://i.imgur.com/R2u8gHn.gif  The fact that he OneUp kit works on several people's bikes without major issue is due simply to relative position provided by the derailleur hanger so basically it's luck."
bikewrench,35mw8c,mcarneybsa,2,Mon May 11 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"You could probably take out some spacers so it measures 120mm from locknut to locknut. Minor redishing of the wheel might be needed too. Another option is to squeeze a 126mm spaced (6/7 speed) wheel into the bike, sometimes this is pretty easy. You can also just cold-set the frame, there is a link on the sidebar about that.  If you haven't bought a new wheel, you can still get new wheels in 27"" size with 120mm rear hubs"

bikewrench,35mw8c,jhenry922,1 point,Mon May 11 22:00:22 2015 UTC,"If you buy a bolt-axle rear wheel with a hub threaded for a freewheel you could reuse your old 5-speed freewheel. Sunrace still makes 5-speed freewheels if you need a new one. If you go with a 6-7, you may need to stretch the frame or find a smaller spacer for the hub - having a bolt axle makes respacing easier. Yet another option would be to convert it to a single speed with a SS freewheel."
bikewrench,35l6og,yabuymeasoda,10,Mon May 11 12:10:55 2015 UTC,"On mobile and typing quickly.  Cone adjustments can be tricky. The cones tighten a bit more when you tighten the lock nut. So, you need to leave the cone the slightest bit loose so that it is properly tightened down when the locknut is screwed down. The process is a lot of ""tighten cone, tighten nut, check for play/grinding...loosen nut, loosen cone, tighten nut, check for play/grinding...repeat""  Sorry, on mobile so"
bikewrench,35l6og,UpTheDownEscalator,10,Mon May 11 12:42:36 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, you can hand tighten the cone onto the bearings so that there's a decent amount of pressure (you get the feel for it) and then hand tighten the locknut onto the cone.  Then use a cone wrench to let the cone off the bearings and onto the locknut.  This method has had more reliable and speedy success for me since the pressure you use to feel for the adjustment is felt prior to the additional friction of the locknut-cone pressure being applied."
bikewrench,35l6og,illustribox,2,Mon May 11 14:00:50 2015 UTC,"What this guy said. I've done this once or twice. It's just really, really tricky. Took me 30min on one hub, but I would imagine an experienced mechanic can tweak this in 5min."
bikewrench,35l6og,Breaker19,3,Mon May 11 13:28:41 2015 UTC,To make the process easier or less tricky.  Tighten the cone and lock nut down on one side good and tight then bring the cone on the other side in lightly til there is no play.  Then just barely snug that lock nut and cone.  at this point they'll stay together and you can then use 2 wrench's either on both the cones(to loosen the whole unit) or 2 wrench's on the lock nuts(to tighten the whole unit)  This will let you make very fine adjustments very easy.  Once you have the pieces just where you want them then tighten the second locknut and cone. then recheck.    Sorry I feel like this would be much easier to show in person.

bikewrench,35l6og,onespeeder,2,Mon May 11 16:15:58 2015 UTC,"If the bearings you pulled out are not polished and shiny chrome when clean, it would be worth it to put new ones in.

bikewrench,35l6og,slowbike,4,Mon May 11 15:07:41 2015 UTC,If you are trying to do it without using cone wrenches then it is very difficult to get it right.

I'd also check the torque on the stem faceplate to make sure it's not your handlebars moving ever so slightly.

I had this happen to me and it was my extra pressure on the handlebars when really cranking hard that was making the creak apparent from my head tube. I swore it was the BB or pedals - but it wasn't.

bikewrench,35kp4o,Elliott_0,3,Mon May 11 09:25:40 2015 UTC,"Hi, I work as a bike wrench and here is my two cents:  I've had quite a few people come to me describing these symptoms and yes, sometimes it is a bearing issue (and very very rarely a cracked frame). However, most commonly the issue is rocks or debris in the bottom bracket shell.  Most frames have holes that allow water to pass through the frame, carrying road debris. That stuff gets left behind in the shell and when there is enough you'll start to hear a steady cracking noise whenever you bear down hard on the crank since you're ever so slightly bending the bottom bracket cartridge against whatever rocks are now wedged beneath it. 70% of the time this issue is resolved by removing the BB and cleaning out the shell."
bikewrench,35kp4o,Elliott_0,2,Mon May 11 14:49:49 2015 UTC,"I would also agree with everyone else though that unless you have enough proper tools and your own stand, a trip to your local shop will be your best bet."

bikewrench,35jxbf,dannykaya,2,Mon May 11 22:10:59 2015 UTC,"I'd do the 11spd crank with 10spd chain/rear mech. I think that Zinn or somebody has actually written up testing about that. However, if you upgrade the crankset, I'd upgrade the FD as well, especially since you're using a triple FD now. Are you using friction shifting for the front right now? Hopefully, because that would work out in your favor.   If you want DI2 and have the funds, go for it! Its fun to play with."

bikewrench,35jxbf,surprisepinkmist,1 point,Mon May 11 09:34:58 2015 UTC,"I'm in the middle of breakfast, so all I will contribute is that the new Shimano 11 speed chains are backwards compatible with 10 speed cassettes and should cost about the same."
bikewrench,35jnjy,machvi,3,Mon May 11 00:38:38 2015 UTC,"You should go with either the Formula OEM hoses, Goodridge, or Jagwire with the appropriate kit. I'm not sure how sensitive mountain bike systems can be but I know that old DOT fluid can eat away at seals in DOT systems in cars. The Shimano lines are engineered with the use of mineral oil in mind and the DOT fluid might prove too corrosive to be used long term. Also the fittings on the Shimano hoses will not play well with your Formula brakes. Goodridge and Jagwire both make kits to fit different Formula brakes, you will be better off with those if you decide to go non-OEM. Also, when you bleed the Formulas with the new line I have had good luck using Avid's method for bleeding but how you bleed is up to you. Also be mindful of the bleed-port O-rings (small, easy to lose, and detrimental to the performance of the brakes)."
bikewrench,35jnjy,txbikerider,1 point,Mon May 11 04:07:23 2015 UTC,"thx for details, i guess i cant do that at lbs as they usually are careless with everything. Is there ghetto bleeding kit i could build or are those kits cheap enough to buy?"
bikewrench,35jnjy,txbikerider,2,Mon May 11 11:53:48 2015 UTC,"You will want a kit that is for Formula as well. Formula makes their own but the brass fittings are made from very soft brass and break. Jagwire makes a kit that you can use on multiple brands but you have to make sure to get the DOT fluid kit. It will cover AVID, Formula, Hayes, and Hope brakes. Also make sure you use DOT 5.1 fluid, I was very particular with this and our shop stocked OEM brand specific fluids."

bikewrench,35jxj9,cdbear,3,Mon May 11 02:18:27 2015 UTC,"Like u/dannykaya said, the crankset will dictate what bottom bracket needs to be used. There are many options for almost every bottom bracket on the market but ultimately you need the one that fits your cranks requirements."

bikewrench,35jsay,shameronsho,4,Mon May 11 01:23:08 2015 UTC,"If you stripped the crank... Probably not covered.  But call them, maybe they will sell you a replacement at a reduced cost.  I don't know if they will or not, but it doesn't hurt to ask.  Threading a steel fastener into an aluminum part is something that definitely requires care and delicacy... And clean parts, and anti-sieze on the threads."
bikewrench,35jsay,MinimusNadir,2,Mon May 11 01:28:46 2015 UTC,"I went into a Specialized retailer to get the replacement pedals, they recommended me a set and showed me how to do it. I'm a handy person so I doubt I messed up installing it. I'll hope for the best. Thanks!"
bikewrench,35jsay,MinimusNadir,1 point,Mon May 11 01:38:04 2015 UTC,"IME, cranks seem MUCH softer than other aluminum parts I've worked with, and are cross-threaded or stripped HUGELY more easily than I would have expected.  I don't know specifics on the alloy or hardening (if any) used on cranks, but assuming that they are 6061, that is MUCH softer and less strong than something like the 200-series tempered aluminum used on cylinder heads.  And, you probably know this, so forgive me for putting it out, but the threads on one pedal are reversed.  I assume that you used the correct pedal for the crank, but if you did use the wrong one on accident, that would be it for the crank."
bikewrench,35jsay,txbikerider,2,Mon May 11 01:58:30 2015 UTC,"I went into a shop that sells Specialized and they showed me a few sets of pedals and told me how to do it, even gave me a little tube of grease."
bikewrench,35jsay,txbikerider,2,Mon May 11 02:01:38 2015 UTC,"Good luck, as a wrench for over a decade this one was very hard to get warrantied even when it could be proven without a doubt. To me it sounds like you didn't have the pedals on tight enough or they were put on backwards."
bikewrench,35jsay,dannykaya,1 point,Mon May 11 04:09:47 2015 UTC,"I know I didn't put them on backwards, I might not know that much about bikes but the pedals were labeled right and left. I used a pedal wrench and tightened them down pretty well. The area that is stripped is pretty deep into the crank arm.   It's starting to sound like I'll have to put together a small defense team to get this covered."
bikewrench,35jsay,dannykaya,5,Mon May 11 04:28:27 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the story falls into the JRA category, ""I was just riding along..."" and those rarely add up to what lead to the problem. I am not saying what you are telling us isn't the truth but there have been many, many people before you that claim they did everything perfectly and that it has to be a manufacturing problem.  One issue I see in your story is that you are ""riding on rough trails"" which the Crosstrail is not really designed for. Gravel, rails to trails, hard packed smooth dirt are all within its grasp but the skinny tires and component selection were not selected with the intention of the bike being ridden off road very much. The suspension fork is misleading in this.   Here is what I've gathered from your post: 1) your ride the bike on rough trails 2) you already broke the original pedals (while not great by any measure they should last a few rides) 3) you installed your pedals on your own  Sorry, pedals just don't break for no reason. Crank arms don't strip because they are bored. I say take this one on the chin, pay the $15 for a new arm, ask the mechanic to install it or to double check your work, and move on.  And the pic below removes all doubt from my mind, the pedals were not tight enough and you felt them wobbling just before the came off (wobbling = loose)."
bikewrench,35jsay,grantrules,-1,Mon May 11 05:15:04 2015 UTC,"No need to get angry, I just wanted to know if this kind of damage is covered. It's surprising to me that its stripped so deep into the crank. If it was starting to unthread it shouldn't strip so deep simply because its not it that far. When I noticed the wobble I thought I had broken the pedal pivot, since the pedal was still flush to the crank when I looked at it. I'm not riding single trail, these are fire roads that can get rocky. And one last thing which will really piss you off, I thought I was looking between $100-200 to get this fixed not $15. Shit man I can do that."
bikewrench,35jsay,dannykaya,1 point,Mon May 11 06:11:59 2015 UTC,Anti sieze? Grease. You must have an automotive background :)
bikewrench,35jsay,dannykaya,2,Mon May 11 03:15:49 2015 UTC,"Its up to the shop, whether they want to get Specialized to send you a warranty crank or not. It depends on what the shop's relationship with Spec is. If they're a big dealer, then Spec is likely to send a new crankarm no questions asked. Technically, you're not under warranty. But that doesn't mean the shop won't take care of you!  You're lucky its the left crank arm, because its cheap to replace regardless."
bikewrench,35jsay,TherapistMD,1 point,Mon May 11 03:21:34 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, I didn't know it was up to the shop to make a claim with the manufacturer. I would like to think since I have only ridden it 10 times for less than 70 miles it would be easy to get it replaced.  It's lucky it's the left, however based on how quickly it happened I'm a bit concerned about the right."

bikewrench,35jyb5,BIGcat180,2,Mon May 11 02:26:04 2015 UTC,"Obviously pictures will make all the difference here, but generally removing the handlebars is pretty simple. On top of the handlebar stem, there is usually a bolt, on old cruisers it will probably be a 1/2"" hex bolt. When you loosen this they should start moving, but if they don't (this being a 70 year old bike this is quite likely), there's still hope. Usually if the bars are stuck, the bolt head will start coming up as you loosen it. Give it a tap with a hammer once it's up a bit and you should at least free the stem expander wedge (the bolt will sink down and freely move up and down once you've done this successfully). If the bars are still stuck after this, start twisting the bars back and forth and you should be able to work them loose. It helps to have the front wheel in the fork so you can hold it between your legs for leverage."

bikewrench,35jyb5,dokydoky,1 point,Mon May 11 06:33:58 2015 UTC,"So I see in the pictures that you've gotten the headset loose. The headset is the bearing mechanism that allows the fork to turn, which is held tight by that big nut below the handlebars. I can't quite tell since there's no good shot from above, but it looks like there is no bolt in the handlebar stem, which means that if the bars aren't moving, the stem is seized or rusted to the inside of the fork. Put the wheel back in the fork, hold in between your legs, and start trying to twist the bars, as long as they aren't too seized, they should start moving and with some elbow grease they should start coming out."
bikewrench,35jyb5,dokydoky,1 point,Tue May 12 05:07:31 2015 UTC,"There is a bolt but I have taken it out and when it goes in it doesn't seem to screw in likely because it is so rusted. Thanks for your help I'll make an attempt with that, if the handle bars don't come off is it a big deal?"
