I wanted to see if people would come to my office if they wanted someone to vent their stress with but of course I'm not part of any cliques or buttfriend group so nobody even thought to come by. The reaction to the graffiti was even hushed. It's such painful proof nobody gives half a fuck about you if you're new.

Plus there's always mentorhelp and wiki. Also construction server might be a bit harder for new players because it's intended to be a sandbox for building stuff.  http://wiki.ss13.co/Getting_Started would be a good place to start for goonstation.  In addition   http://wiki.ss13.co/Guides  This is a list of every guide, use it if you want to learn something specific like genetics or mechanics  Note that sometimes guides need updating and mentorhelp is a good place to ask, in addition to other players.

SS13,3dynfc,Aj_The_Wanderer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:34:48 2015 UTC,"Alright, here's my advice.  If you're going to go lowRP (AKA: The Hippie/Goon root) you'll learn the game pretty fast. There used to be a Facepunch station a while back where I learned the game, and my first job was Security. DON'T PICK SECURITY AS YOUR FIRST JOB! I mean you'll get good at combat and learn station layouts faster, but its a ton to take in if you have a good sec team, or its a really bad greytide round.  But... look at the jobs you want to play, if you want to play as a Chemist (Scientist) then I'd recommend playing bartender, as it gives you the foundation for how chemicals work (or booze in this case, but you can mix some lethal stuff if you're creative) and how deadly a soda from a vending machine can be when mixed right.  This may sound silly, but if you want to be robust (good at combat) go Janitor. You have enough stuff in your janitorial closet to get people into stuns and cuff them with your zipties (or handcuffs you might've stolen.).  Alright I'm going to tell you about the RP servers because after Facepunch started losing players in droves I moved to Paradise and played on there a long while.  If was fun, and its where the basics started to become understandable and it was fun for a long time. But I wouldn't say any of my rounds on there were interesting (unless you count my Captain Ax Murderer Story) but I did get some fun stories when I decided to break some rules, BUT DON'T DO THAT! IF YOU WANT LACK OF RP, WACKY VIOLENCE (with consenting combatants, don't go murderboning), AND CRAZY NONVIOLENT ANTICS LIKE BREAKING INTO A VAULT AS A CLOWN THEN STICK TO LOWRP!  Its just that many rounds are really slow, they expect you to have a character to flesh out and stick to no matter what, and most of the time it will feel like a work simulator. You'll have the coworkers you love being around, and ones that you wish the ling would get a hold of because their snooty catbeast ass just needs to disappear. I mean if you have a story you want to tell through the medium of cooperative writing, then by all means go on Bay, Paradise, or one of the numerous RP stations that are in the game.  But be warned, for some reason SS13 just attracts some real assholes on both HRP and LowRP. So if someone starts talking shit at you, don't go looking for them with a vengeance, unless you know how to make their life a living Hell without touching them."

The engineer sets up a big containment field somewhere remote like the bomb testing area or in one of the structures on the asteroid. RD meanwile gets a hand tele (or two), prepares a lot of space lube and creates either a military mech or some kind of a super soldier (using either a volunteer, or the engineer once they're done).   The mech/soldier gets a beacon, gets into the field and someone (RD) outside activates it. The RD and their helper then proceed to space lube people into portals leading to the arena where they have to fight to the death on a pile of previous victims. Bonus points for ""YOU WILL BE JUDGED"" written on the floor.  The problem with plans like this is that even if you get together enough antags, it's hard to pull it off without at least some metagaming (I don't mean skyping or something, but at least agreeing on the plan beforehand).

It's true, mainly because people don't trust new players or just want to be with their clique. But there is a little difference between OOC and IC.

SS13,3e1w4z,Finalsong1,4,Tue Jul 21 09:50:16 2015 UTC,"Even though OP is a pillar of salt, I figure this warrants an actual anwer anyway.  To me, personally, Apoc. Why, you ask?  I get word that Apoc is terrible from, well, about EVERYONE on Archangel back in the day. Okay. Cool beans. I wanna investigate.  Hop on the server, play a while, die to a gang of people. I adminhelp saying I was very abruptly kill by people, list names. Was told at least one was traitor. Round ends, none of their names show as traitors.  Okay, lying to me isn't cool.  I confront the admin telling me this, and quite abruptly die due to, surprise surprise, the same group. Admin tells me to piss off back to AA. Really. Really now. I had come on there of my own accord, independent of AA, and got grudged by a small group of players and an admin. As I explain my intentions were not malicious, banned for a day.  I can't believe this.  I contact AIGamerGirl about these, zero response. I move on.  I was then told the SCP Teamspeak was merging with apoc. Okay, I liked SCP Foundation, and was still curious, whydafucknot? so I join the TS as the Breadman, and make breadpuns until told to stop. Then I investigatify.  Ask an admin a few things, who does what, which is in charge, yadda yadda. He is courteous at best, while regulars heckle. Finally, I ask who owns the TS.  Uh oh.  The guy who run the TS, PurpleSpazz or something like that, hops on in. I ask him the same thing, and almost immediately, he says ""oh my god it's fucking Shoxx (?) ban him"". I and all the other D-class, banned immediately.  That's not nice.  I noticed a thread about the badness of Apoc and decided to share my experience, and immediately, out strolls PurpleSpazz.  ""hi guy, you're fucking toxic, i don't want you in my place you baiter""  What a great way to dissuade the reputation of having an unfriendly community/staff."

We have a sense of humour, and dont take the whole thing too seriously.   Honestly this sub is the most toxic part of the whole experience. People come here to vent, which is fine.

I tell him ""we're not assholes, I'm his friend, I can confirm it.""  What sense does that make? Another example is to ask Hitler(if he were still alive) if the nazis were bad people, or if the holocaust was wrong. You're obviously going to get insanely biased answers, you need outside opinion to actually make it fact. I worded it wrong. I'm not trying to say he isn't allowed to express his opinion, I'm saying he can't just say he/his friend/other admins/whoever the fuck isn't shit because they're associated with them and thus have a biased opinion.

That doesn't mean Fred's opinion is less valid than Bob's. And Bob's isn't inherently more valid because he doesn't know Frank.   I'd also like to know if you'd even be making this point if AlexanderDivine had said that Bay's staff were awful. That's still bias, right? Bias is not inherently positive or negative.  Additionally I actually think that someone who is part of any given server's organization has, if anything, /more/ standing when sharing their opinions about their server. They are closer to it, they generally understand how things actually are, etc.  I'll even say that for Bay specifically (I'm trying to keep this server agnostic, because...yeah) we've definitely had admins that have straight up come out and said they disagree with how it's going or that X admin is shit or whatever. Fuck, I've even posted in the past about things we could do better.   Are we not allowed to say these things because we're closer to the issues than ""outside"" viewpoints? I think not."

They are closer to it, they generally understand how things actually are, etc.   I see where you're coming from, but when you're closer to the subject, you also tend to be more supportive of your own actions.  It's like how you think you look good in the mirror, then you go outside and someone takes you picture and that's when you realize you don't look as good as you do.  All I'm saying is if you're that close to something, don't try to confirm something to go against what was said. It's fine if it's your opinion and everything, but it's only 'fact'(barely) when the general majority accepts it. I didn't say anything about any of the admins being bad, either.

No, I wouldn't, and you know I wouldn't. You wouldn't either. This wasn't meant to balloon into some autistic argument about who's right and who's wrong.

I draw my taser and lock onto him saying ""drop it or i'll shoot you"" he starts saying some crap like ""lighten up"" and i say it again. He drops it and goes to the locker room. I follow him only to have the detective unload all his rubber bullets into my face and have them remove all my shit. i get off one yell and then they've got me in the execution chamber and are already injecting me with it.

Yes, shoot me for naming an admin hated by quite a few people at the top, but Yith's adminnery influenced my own procedures, and he's swell to talk to. We also tend to doot together. Don't let your memes be dreams.  -Pixelnator, the man, the legend, Unity vet, Dappy mentor. The person who sent me my first admin PM, after I killed an SSD person with an oxygen tank (I was incredibly new to SS13, but somehow managed to look like a seasoned griefer, ID in hand, gas mask on face), and taught me how to play. I also tried to convince him I was Markiplier, and he called me on my bullshit. I told the actual Mark this, and he laughed his ass off.  -Jamini, host of the old Unity. We never really did talk much in the beginning, but Jamini helped me get through a very personal issue quite voluntarily, when he could have just said it wasn't his problem. An admin who does not forget who he is is a good person. He also gave me the confidence to come out of the closet, a choice I don't regret one bit.  -Norc, Archangel's proprietor and one of the more disliked server owners on Reddit. This man has taken so much abuse it's not even funny. He has been measured in kiloHitlers on this very subreddit. But what does he do about it? nothing! He keeps  on being that cheery, happy-go-lucky goosemonger that he's always been, just letting the rage happen without censor. It takes a man to allow his reputation to be trashed without defending himself.  -indirectly, one of the eldest on the list, Foos of Facepunch and Hippie. In my spare time, I read ban appeals and admin/player complaints. I perused FP's ban hall of fame, and every post Foos ever made was calm, cool and collected, even in the face of insults and foolishness. Foos was my legitimate inspiration to become an admin, to be the unbiased mediator who keeps personal opinions out of judgement, and be he who does the things.  -GrandSolace, a disgraced host of a server many people have probably never heard of. He was utterly trashed, his admins turned on him, and he lost his own server to lies and filth. But to the bitter end, he loved his community, and never ever turned on them. While Foos was my inspiration to be an admin, Solace was the reinforcement, teaching me that being an admin does not mean being an uncaring god. It means to be the voice for the common player, to remember who you were before you gained power, to never stop caring for those you were told to watch over.

At least spamming the signal is usually what I do if the beaker doesn't activate right away, some chems won't explode either way. Combine chemicals like chlorine trifluoride with stabilized smoke powder if they don't set off right away. An admin or coder should probably comment on that."

SS13,3dx18y,Spy_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:28:35 2015 UTC,"IIRC I could premix ch3f and heat it to make it (Bar is usually a good spot for mixing and making Cfl3, given you can just go two/three (depending on your experience with fire chems, the farther away the better) tiles down from the reagent heater and watch the pretty white fire), make some stabilized smoke powder , and then mix the two. combine that beaker with a igniter/signaller for a beaker assembly, and then spam signall to release a cloud of pure destructive fire.  I once accidentally blew a hole in a goonstation bathroom (near engineering) which happened to be right next to two welding fluid tanks. I was trying to kill a blob and instead I discovered a really good spot for impromptu fireball bombs. I think it even blew a hole in robotics.  No idea if that still works but I assume it does. Not willing to test without antag role.  Directions for stablized smoke powder  oxygen+iron+hydrogen to make stablizer I think.  Then mix your smoke powder with about 10 units of stablizer inside it.  something like stabilizer + sugar + phosphorus + potassium. That way it doesn't turn into smoke powder early."

SS13,3dpcvv,Glloyd9714,8,Sat Jul 18 04:02:43 2015 UTC,"Shuttle architect and Captain Petra Belrose of the Angry Marines here. Let's take a shuttle tour.  Welcome aboard the NMV Belligerent Engine. Right now, you're standing in the main compartment. I planned on sectioning this off, but not much of the crew cooperated, and I was too busy channeling ANGER at aliens for force them to comply. This turned into a general storage area basically the second we launched. The crew dormitory is visible at the top. The two ""engineering"" compartments are welding tank storage, installed as a safeguard against the previous round's sympathetic detonations. As a note, the shuttle was an empty shell at the moment we launched; all of this was constructed in-flight except for the exterior, and I did the majority of the walls an machines myself.  Hydroponics- Because every ANGRY MARINE needs a food supply. Given that our farmer died almost immediately (and was cloned AT LEAST twice), this room never really got used as intended. It ended up being air canister storage and an emergency evacuation room, until the back half got blown out. Emergency shields protected us at that point. The Warp shan't overtake us!  Medbay- Even ANGER cannot save you from a lasbolt to the face. Our portable surgery tables had been moved into the main compartment for extra space, while medbay remained as storage and clear atmos. Cloning was set up at the very beginning, and served us well with AT LEAST four clones produced.  Research Bay and Bridge/Armory- One must acquire sufficient dakka to purge the xeno and the heretic. Research and Development got torn out of its normal location and relocated here. The bridge contained a chemistry machine, piles of guns, an incomplete sleeper, an air canister, and a few other things. Mostly low-traffic area for non combat personnel to reach. Research, on the other hand, saved our asses with PILES of Advanced Energy Guns. Later on, as crew fell, I ended up taking up a pair of AEGs and going full lethal on the boarding group of empresses and other aliens. Two AEGs helps overcome the recharge and all.  Poly's Prison. Runtime and Poly were both brought aboard (and, to my knowledge, both survived the round). Late in the round, robotics was installed in this room, and a Durand was produced and used against XENO SCUM. SEND IN THE TERMINATORS, PURGE THE ALIENS.  Hope you enjoyed the tour. We set forth with our crew once more to PURGE XENOS across the system, in preparation for Galactic Crisis mode."

Luckily, someone had the forethought to bring a cloner, else everyone would've been completely fucked.

SS13,3dnqmy,iyaerP,3,Fri Jul 17 23:23:53 2015 UTC,"Here is my recipe for true maxcap bombs.   mix 2x plasma, 1x oxygen. go to the lower room, and supercool oxygen. superheat the plasma. wait a few minutes grab canisters, and put them into the canisters, fill the plasma one till 1000Kpa and the oxygen till max maxcap, efficient, and quick no need to empty."
SS13,3dnqmy,oops_ur_dead,3,Fri Jul 17 21:53:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, super cooling oxygen and getting it into an empty oxygen tank increases the bomb lethality and destruction quite alot.  (If I'm correct, get a normal oxygen canister and another empty yellow canister and wrench them both, get the oxygen in the room, open the blast doors to space, wait a while, close them, get the final product in the yellow thing, get an empty oxygen tank, put it in said yellow canister and fill it to the brim)"
SS13,3dnqmy,GoonOnMoon,2,Fri Jul 17 22:06:09 2015 UTC,Very informative. Good post. +1
SS13,3dnqmy,shadow_of_octavian,2,Fri Jul 17 20:24:14 2015 UTC,"2/4/9 is pretty sad for a bomb.  That isn't even the OLD bombcap, nevermind the new one."
SS13,3dnqmy,dug232,2,Fri Jul 17 23:44:25 2015 UTC,As said before its the bare minimum to make a quick bomb  Super cooling oxygen and placing it into the blue tank for the transfer valve can make it even more powerful.

This issue is probably too do with buying hub polling.  In world.topic you can change your server name/gamemode and player count by default this is automatically calculated but you could change it to a false number. This leads me to believe that the blue/red icon lists the verified players online which is probably processed periodically.  TLDR: Update your server to 507+, be aware that the hub has to verify player count."

Make an all-healing patch of synthflesh and omnizine, or dark matter + chloral hydrate foam riot-suppression grenades for security.

After the drama-heavy round of Bay where I'm surrounded by charred corpses of friends, attempting to clone them but then the power goes out and I'm stuck in a room full of bodies...  A relaxing round of extended is always welcome. Vorestation only does extended unless they're doing a special event, so that means I can just mess around. One of my favorite things is to have a neurotoxin spray fight.  And yeah, Vorestation has a lot of furries, I'm one of them. Vorestation's code allows many people to actually play as their furry character or ""fursona"", which is usually a character that has a large sentimental value towards the owner. That's a huge attraction. Imagine having a character made up for years and you FINALLY get to play as them in a game, it's a pretty awesome feeling."

For an OP Sedative, a bottle of 45 Neurotoxin and 15 Chloral Hydrate, a five unit injection knocks a man down instantly and puts them to sleep with mild, easily healed toxins.  Put that mix into an auto injector or hypo spray and you have yourself a 1-click, instant nonlethal takedown.   Also, napalm on Bay is super overpowered. A small grenade can ruin large portions of the station, I once -accidentally- killed everybody in medbay -self included- when a small napalm bomb fizzled out and released the phoron (used around 30 units) into the air. Phoron was ignited by a guy in the hallway smoking a cig, and then I watched as everybody burned.  I ran as soon as I saw the flames, but the firelocks shut and I couldn't open them in time.

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through. I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your post gave me cancer anways."

SS13,3dafqi,shiverwulf,2,Tue Jul 14 20:09:20 2015 UTC,"You can have a multicoloured fruit if you are using the most recent Baycode xenoflora. Specify TRAIT_PLANT_COLOUR as green and TRAIT_PRODUCT_COLOUR as orange, and have separate icons for the green and orange portions of the plant. Look at how carrots are done.  If anyone would like to do a pass on the colours and icons to make them look less shitty, the effort would be appreciated. I don't have much of an eye for fine detail when it comes to greyscale icons and didn't do a very good job of converting them since it was a batch processing job."

SS13,3dafqi,shiverwulf,4,Tue Jul 14 20:14:01 2015 UTC,But it actively makes the sprites worse by making them use less colours.  I like the way things are layed out in the code now but making sprites uglier seems kind of useless and unnecessary it was perfectly fine as it was.
SS13,3dafqi,shiverwulf,4,Tue Jul 14 20:25:00 2015 UTC,"The system that existed at the time was not readily extensible/usable for fully random products, and since I wanted to add gene splicing and variant colours the icons had to be greyscaled. If it's a insurmountable problem for you, it would not be particularly difficult to remove the colour scaling and grab the old hydroponics.dmi file from the git history. Alternatively you could just improve the admittedly pretty shit greyscaled masks to be sharper and more detailed."
SS13,3dafqi,Iammyselfnow,2,Tue Jul 14 21:59:55 2015 UTC,"Huh I didn't know that, it does make alot of sense, It was less a problem with it being something I can't get over and more a ""I don't know why they're doing this"".  That being said should I hold off on submitting any new plants and recipies as they're done in the old system, Or is it fine to just convert them into grayscale I admit I haven't really played this game for about 2-3 months but I want to expand the Service jobs like Chef, Bartender and Gardener they haven't got any coder love for years."
SS13,3dafqi,Whitey789,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:12:12 2015 UTC,"Depends who you're submitting to, if you're pushing sprites to a repo running Bay plant code and they aren't greyscale then they're not going to work at all."
SS13,3dafqi,shiverwulf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:39:44 2015 UTC,I have to agree that the new sprites are ugly as fuck.
SS13,3dafqi,Whitey789,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:27:28 2015 UTC,Less colour and ugly sprites? Are we playing the same game?  PROTIP; The game is UGLY. It gets over this by having a lot of depth. This is universal through all SS13 codebases.

SS13,3d7a98,TheTrueDisciple,15,Tue Jul 14 05:48:08 2015 UTC,He's squatting on a codebase built on the back of other people's GPL3 work and abusing a loophole to avoid releasing it. It isn't a defensible or moral position.
SS13,3d7a98,shiverwulf,8,Tue Jul 14 06:08:41 2015 UTC,Don't you play on that server? How is Norc hoarding the code better than giving it up and allowing someone else to run the server?

I would much rather have it go to someone who worked on it."

Good.    Go work QA. You aren't too good for it. You are gonna need to do bitch work for a buncha years regardless of your field.    Too good for it? Learn to network. Volunteer at a local place. EMS, Fire dept, police, red cross, old folks home. Network with folks. Not your field? Engage with open source foundations. Get a big Ole portfolio of code. Already have that? Beg on some subreddit for an out of use corporation. Some folks will give you one if you spring for transfer fees. Have the Corp hire you. Market the shit out of the corp. Consult through your corp for a substantially higher rate with less questions about your experience.     Not your deal? Grab cell phone dev kits and start pumping out ad heavy apps. Takes 4-6 months to make any meaningful amount of money but if you continuously dev, you'll have a paycheck. You literally need less experience than you claim to have to do this.     Hate humanity? Start a Tumblr, claim mayonnaise as your gender identity, start a patreon.  Make an indie mayo based visual novel. Get hired by gawker.    I don't lack compassion for him. But everyone is struggling. I've just met so many complete Losers playing this game. Some of them have more to complain about. Dude bro has a four year degree and lots of ""startup"" experience.

He can go fuck himself. I hope this is true and that he's actually facing the problems he says he is, so he can face the consequences he deserves for being a huge dick to everyone."

SS13,3d2a8o,Stenwalden,2,Mon Jul 13 02:35:13 2015 UTC,"I have seen worse once. Someone has connected power sink to solars too. But in that case, solars were disconnected from main station."

SS13,3d2a8o,Rainbow_Cow,4,Mon Jul 13 04:13:04 2015 UTC,Solars and maint near engineering are the areas people usually check first. Your better off building a little closet somewhere in maint and running a wire there.

SS13,3d1vo0,SammyVimes,2,Mon Jul 13 08:22:25 2015 UTC,"This wasn't Hippie, it was Citadel."

SS13,3d1vo0,-J_C-,9,Tue Jul 14 00:13:55 2015 UTC,The wizard was the only person to die that round.
SS13,3d1vo0,ninjacha,9,Sun Jul 12 21:14:25 2015 UTC,Well he was trying to assassinate Max Payne. Wizards need some better fucking intel.
SS13,3d1vo0,Doctor-Clockwork,6,Sun Jul 12 22:26:08 2015 UTC,"""Einstein was right. Time is relative to the observer. When you're looking down the barrel of a wand, time slows down, your whole life flashes by, heartbreak and scars. Stay with it, and you can live a lifetime in that split second.""  You are unable to equip that.  You are unable to equip that  You are unable to equip that.  You are unable to equip that."
SS13,3d1vo0,theonlydkdreng,3,Mon Jul 13 02:02:39 2015 UTC,Had knock instad of EIIIIIIIII NAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHHHHH. Not average.
SS13,3d1vo0,Blizzzzz,2,Mon Jul 13 02:05:03 2015 UTC,The average wizard.

SS13,3d1vo0,Hero_of_None,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:22:05 2015 UTC,"I thought the average round had the wizard murderboning the crew, flood it with plasma, blow up the station as the ride off alone on the shuttle, but their target is still SSD at arrivals."
SS13,3d1vo0,atomic1fire,3,Mon Jul 13 15:49:43 2015 UTC,"Nah, they usually fireball theirselves immediately upon spawning."
SS13,3d1vo0,Hero_of_None,3,Mon Jul 13 16:06:54 2015 UTC,On tg wizards often spark manhunts and mass distribution of weapons.
SS13,3d6rn0,valzargaming,2,Mon Jul 13 23:32:29 2015 UTC,Wouldn't make more sense to have a stress test with the custom code on?
SS13,3d6rn0,TheJamesRussle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:43:10 2015 UTC,"I'm stress testing internet connectivity right now, specifically bandwidth. I already know our processing is fine, seeing as we're running smoother than the official TG server."
SS13,3d6rn0,ninjacha,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:49:35 2015 UTC,I'll throw my botnet at it if thats okay?
SS13,3d6rn0,TheJamesRussle,-1,Tue Jul 14 00:28:03 2015 UTC,White hat please go! Black hat or gtfo!!!
SS13,3d6rn0,ninjacha,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:45:01 2015 UTC,"He said it was okay in OOC, Hes hosting off of his home connection too, raped his server for 100 seconds lol."
SS13,3d6rn0,ninjacha,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:19:50 2015 UTC,"If I was still in Illinois, the botnet spam would not even phase the server. Unfortunately Florida's ISP (Time Warner) is nowhere near as robust."
SS13,3d6rn0,ninjacha,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:25:15 2015 UTC,Bright house you mean? And that was only a Layer 4 attack! I could turn it to NTP or some other layer 7 attack and destroy your internet.
SS13,3d6rn0,Apophis775,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:05:23 2015 UTC,"Brighthouse is owned by Time Warner, yes. They run exclusively on a copper broadband system, so it's extremely cheap (Not for me though)."
SS13,3d6rn0,Hydre-SS13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:15:54 2015 UTC,80 a month for shit internet for me. I also live in FL. Where abouts are you?

SS13,3d6rn0,Hydre-SS13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:25:02 2015 UTC,Making another station?
SS13,3d6rn0,Hydre-SS13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:19:36 2015 UTC,"No, we're brining back the original and putting it on updated code. Pretty much the same administration team."
SS13,3d6rn0,Apophis775,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:34:17 2015 UTC,I swear I know your name from somewhere....
SS13,3d6rn0,Hydre-SS13,2,Tue Jul 14 15:37:15 2015 UTC,"Well I would hope so! I've been around since Donut Station and I have my own Youtube and Twitch channels, occasionally streaming different SS13 gameplay."
SS13,3d6rn0,Apophis775,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:43:46 2015 UTC,Alright yeah but I think I know you from like..Playing with you for some time? Do you happen to have administrated any servers?
