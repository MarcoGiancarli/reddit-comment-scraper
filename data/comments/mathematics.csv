mathematics,3e0eto,vy2005,4,Tue Jul 21 00:13:22 2015 UTC,"So let's add in a few simplifications to get to roughly what the top comment was attempting to simulate, and then talk about the rationale from there.  Once we assume that we're on a 2-d grid, we can step in any 1 direction at a time (and we'll use compass directions, though arbitrary directions don't change too much), with no other people on the grid other than the hunter and the prey, we have a relatively straightforward graph -- an abstract object with arbitrary blobs called ""nodes"", and ""edges"" that join these nodes.  The abstraction to a graph doesn't change the problem, but can make it a little easier to reason about. When using the 4 compass directions, each node has 4 edges (except for nodes along the border of our 2-d grid, which have 3 edges, and nodes on the corner of our 2-d grid, which have 2 edges).  At this point, we're essentially trying to consider what happens for different kinds of random walks on graphs. In the example in the question, the hunter has some unspecified strategy, while the prey is walking randomly. An intuition for the eventual answer -- yes, if both entities walk, your chances of finding them are better -- can be gathered from imagining what happens if you colour a node on this graph and then randomly walk to find it, as compared to randomly colouring a node on the graph and letting it randomly move from its position: you can almost transform the second option into the first, where the hunter is allowed two random steps per time instance.  From here, if it's something you might consider studying for a science fair, I won't spoil too much in the field without being asked to do so -- I would highly recommend checking out a 46-page summary summary on the topic (though it may be a little old, it's a particularly good starting point and where I learned from when I had a summer project on this topic). The mathematics itself ends up leading you to an equivalence between random walks on graphs and [Time-reversible] [Markov chains], both areas that are incredibly interesting to study.  HTH a small amount, and of course feel free to ask questions. :)"

mathematics,3e0eto,lifow,2,Tue Jul 21 00:21:55 2015 UTC,"Back of the envelope intuition about why the people find each other twice as fast if they move:  If we fix our ""origin"" on one of our people (both of whom are moving) then we essentially have the situation of one person moving and the other still all over again, although this time the ""moving"" person is moving twice as fast. Why are they moving twice as fast? Because every time they move their movement is the sum of the movements of person A and person B, or, equivalently it's as if person A stayed still and person B moved twice."
mathematics,3e0eto,nctweg,2,Tue Jul 21 18:55:02 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering now about something to make our situation a bit more realistic.    The assumption is that only one person is actively looking while the other is just going about his or her amusement park enjoying ways.  But realistically, if you're the person just enjoying the park, you're not going to be mobile the entire time; it seems to me that you can probably add in something extra here.  I'm thinking along the lines of having them randomly walk with some probability, each step, of stopping to go on a ride (or eat, play a game, whatever).  And then, of course, if they trigger that probability, assume that they no longer move for some number of steps as they'll be waiting on what is likely to be a long line.    I'm actually wondering now how feasible this kind of model would be.  I'm familiar with random walks but I've never really pushed them too far.  I suppose I'm really wondering how realistic such a model can be made mathematically as it doesn't seem useful to assume that our people are just wandering aimlessly the whole time.  Edit - now that I think about it more, I think this would be a good scenario to entertain from a simulation standpoint.  More of a fire up 100 trials on a computer and see how it turns out kind of scenario I guess."

mathematics,3dxp81,jimbelk,3,Mon Jul 20 15:06:24 2015 UTC,"Hi. Sorry for the late response. Sure. Actually I'm writing my masters thesis right now and the topic revolves around von Neumann algebras, a special case of C*-algebras.  Suppose we've been given a commutative unital Banach algebra, say A. If you take a look at the set of all nonzero algebra-homomorphism going from A into the complex numbers C, then this set is in fact a locally compact Hausdorff space, if we take the relative topology on this set as a subset of the dual space of A ( - in fact everyone of those homomorphisms has norm one).  Now if A is an (unital) commutative von Neumann algebra, then this Hausdorff space satisfies this property, i.e. every open subset has an open closure.  By the way. I'm starting to doubt myself here. Does this property imply discreteness of the space? Or rather, is it equivalent to every open subset being closed? The latter definitely implies discreteness.   Edit: I replied to another person than I intended to. Sorry again!"
mathematics,3dxp81,jimbelk,3,Mon Jul 20 19:24:50 2015 UTC,"Such a space X certainly has the property that every sequence that converges is eventually constant.  For suppose to the contrary that there exists a point p that is the limit of some sequence x_n in X - p.  Without loss of generality, we may assume that the terms of x_n are distinct.  I claim that we can inductively choose a disjoint sequence of open sets {U_n} such that U_n contains x_n.    To prove this, observe first that for each x_n we can use the Hausdorff property to separate x_n from p.  The neighborhood of p contains all but finitely many terms of the sequence, so we can in fact find disjoint open sets V_n and W_n so that V_n contains x_n and W_n contains p as well as all the other terms of the sequence.  Then the sets U_n = W_1 \cap \cdots \cap W_{n-1} \cap V_n are open and disjoint.  Now that we have the sequence U_n of disjoint open sets, observe that the union of U_n for odd n is an open set that has p as a limit point, but does not have x_n for any even n in its closure.  This is a contradiction, for then the closure of this union is an open set that contains p but does not contain x_n for any even n.  Thus a space with this property cannot have any nontrivial convergent sequences.  It follows that every metric space with this property, and indeed every first countable space with this property, must be discrete.  However, there do exist non-discrete compact Hausdorff spaces with no nontrivial convergent sequences, e.g. the Stone-ÄŒech compactification of an infinite discrete space.  I have no idea whether such spaces have the desired property."

This is a contradiction, for then the closure of this union is an open set that contains p but does not contain x_n for any even n.   I'm having a hard time with this part. How does n being odd or even come into play here?"

mathematics,3ccevu,matematiskt,10,Mon Jul 6 20:40:41 2015 UTC,"Well, LaTeX is probably the best tool out there for this sort of thing, where the Tikz package allows you to draw arbitrarily and with lots of extras for making things easier, but LaTeX has a pretty steep learning curve.  It's really easy to produce PDFs from it, but you can really use it to produce just about any output type.  Again, LaTeX  is hard to learn, particularly if you aren't accustomed to writing code, but that doesn't make it impossible.  There are several well written books on the subject that you can find for free online, and the community is fairly large, but it can seem pretty daunting at first.  I do consider it to be a very valuable skill, though.  I've used it to write everything from presentations (the beamer package makes nice presentations) to my resume to history papers, and everything in between.  It's unmatched in mathematical typesetting, and provides incredibly powerful tools for doing whatever you need to do.  If you're going to do this sort of thing frequently then I'd recommend it, otherwise maybe someone else can suggest a friendlier solution."
mathematics,3ccevu,bheklilr,4,Mon Jul 6 21:09:47 2015 UTC,This is probably what you want.  When I started LaTeX I just had a sample document then searched for anything specific i wanted. It is surprisingly versatile.

Is it possible to include this?"
mathematics,3ccevu,bheklilr,3,Tue Jul 7 16:26:07 2015 UTC,"So latex code compiles into a document format, frequently just a PDF. It's capable of the full range of PDF features, including the interactive and animated components, including images and having flashy colors is actually one of the easier things you can do with it. As an example, I recently used it to make a presentation that included math formula, colored diagrams, matrices, color images, an auto generated reference slide, and a custom style with minimal effort. Doing it in PowerPoint would have been virtually impossible. Pretty much everything is possible in latex, it'd actually a Turing complete language if you're into that sort of thing."

How do you suggest to go from knowing how to code in LaTeX to getting the content onto the web site?   There is the MathJax Javascript library for integrating some LaTeX features in the web, but for more complicated stuff you'll be best off generating an image or something and embedding that on your website normally.  I've definitely used LaTeX to generate images then sliced them down to size for insertion into other documents.  If you want to draw diagrams in the webpage that are interactive or dynamically generated then I can recommend the D3 JS library.  It's fairly friendly and uses SVGs to produce really nice scalable graphics, but it's not as mature or feature-rich as Tikz and other LaTeX libraries.  For the simple things that you need to do, I would say you can probably get away with MathJax and D3 without too much trouble if all you want is to embed it in a web page.  It's probably easier than getting a LaTeX development environment set up."

As for development environment I'm not completely sure, but I would assume that such a widely used language would have some tutorials for that online.

When you get beyond just generating PDFs you need some extra tools to automatically generate the images, ImageMagick is a popular choice.

Reddit comments, for instance, are written in a markdown format. Instead of having:  <ul>     <li>item</li> </ul>   you can just have:   *item   pandoc is nice in that it lets you convert to and from many different formats (ie docx, pdf, html+mathjax, etc) and just convert to the one that you want as output. I like markdown because it's simple and you can just focus on content. If you wanted to write html+js+mathjax, I think it would still let you convert that to pdf (though I haven't tried).   I don't have special knowledge of mathjax nor latex right now. Or are you saying that this is the only way to put latex directly on a website - to convert it to mathjax?   There is usually not just a single way to do something and this is not an exception. mathjax is just javascript that iterates the html DOM/through html tags and takes \[formula\] or $formula$ and converts them to images or mathml on the page. pandoc would output to that format if you wanted and wouldn't force you to write all the html, but if you prefer the html, you can certainly do that as well.  If you don't want to do latex at all, you even have alternatives of using MS Word and exporting your equations as MathML. I believe you can also directly export Word documents as html or as pdf if you don't want to do html either.  Alternatively, you can write pure latex, and convert from that with latex2html and not need any javascript, all of these things are preferences and have their own strengths and weaknesses."

Here is my best speculation based on my limited experience with topology.  At its heart, topology is the study of connections, so you can imagine how it could be useful for modelling social or economic phenomena (eg. how the presence of different lending options and requirements influences how money flows through an economy).  Many of the important topological properties of an object are controlled by the holes of the object, in part because holes distinguish different connections from each other. To see this, pick 2 points on the plane and draw 2 non-overlapping paths between them. I can slide those paths along the surface of the plane so that they end up on top of each other and I can do it without breaking either path, untethering it from its end-points, or gluing any parts of the surface to each other. However, if I poked a hole between those paths, I wouldn't be able to slide them over each other; they'd get stuck on that hole and some parts of the connections wouldn't be able to meet.  It's pretty nebulous to me what would constitute the economic or social equivalent of a hole, but I would envision something perhaps like an estate tax that exempts jewelery, which would cause a disproportionate amount of money to flow through the jewelery industry as people convert liquid assets into jewelery and back as a tax dodge. Removing it would cause that flow to merge back in to the usual flow of assets. I wouldn't take this paragraph too seriously though, this is just bullshitting an illustration.  The main point is that, if you could find a general way of adding or removing such holes or ""voids,"" you could change how social or economic resources flow through it in truly fundamental ways. But that sounds more like social science research to find the mechanism than the mathematics that might describe such a thing, so who knows?"

High level mathematics is difficult enough as it is -- finding someone who is both an expert in the field and willing to teach what they know in a way that everyone understands is difficult, and it's comments like yours that reinforce the elitist, unapproachable stereotype of those that work in research/academia/maths in general. /r/mathematics should be about encouraging people to contribute and ask questions about difficult maths (which is exactly what the sidebar description suggests it's for) but every time someone makes a comment likes yours and shits on a contributor a potential new mathematician is likely to be turned away: would you want to ask a question in a forum or field where even someone who has a flair indicating some kind of expertise is immediately shit on for the smallest of nits?

The second multiplicative term inscribes the unit circle in the complex plane, sweeping one revolution every time x increases by 2.  The first term, 2x , in context of the whole expression, is the distance from the origin.  So the curve sweeps around and around as the distance increases.  It's a spiral in the complex plane.

To see this, note that \u\singlemonad's version of (-2)x  gives, for example, that (-2){1/3} is not a real number.  So, his/her function suffers from the fact that it doesn't agree with the convention of taking a1/n to be a real root of xn - a = 0.  This isn't that big of a deal; it's just something to keep in mind if you actually plan on using this function.  One could define things differently as follows:  First note that we can define ab when a is negative as long as b is a rational number with odd denominator.  If b is a rational number with even denominator, or if b is irrational, approximate it with a sequence {b_n} of rationals which have odd denominator.  Then ab is by definition the limit of the sequence ab_n .  One checks that the result does not change if one takes a different such sequence converging to b, so we really do have a map b --> ab   on the entire real line.  One also sees that ab is itself a real number(!) with this convention.    Edit:  This definition suffers as well:  exponents don't act like they should, in that (ab)c != abc .  For example, ((-2)1/2)2 = 2, not -2, with this convention."

So the function takes a real number and gives you some point in the spiral.  You could also visualize this other ways: through absolute value and phase (or complex argument), which you can plot separately. A little more math:  (-2)x = 2x ( cos(pi x) + i sin(pi x) )  Taking the absolute value:  abs( (-2)x ) = 2x  Taking the argument: (by definition z=|z| ( cos(P(Z))+ i sin(P(Z))  P(Z) = pi*x (mod 2 pi)  So you can see the absolute value of the function grows and it's phase wraps around  http://wolfr.am/5iErO34c  http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=graph+abs+of+%28%28-2%29%5Ex+%29+in+%5B-1%2C1%5D"

If you pick a positive integer (or even a positive even integer) truly at random, it will be a power of two with probability zero:  The number of powers of two less than n is log_2(n), so the probability of a random integer less than n being a power of 2 is log_2(n)/n.  Take the limit as n goes to infinity, you get 0.  However, if you think about the set of positive integers (or positive even integers) and the set of powers of two, they have the same cardinality, since you can construct a bijection from the first set onto the second by n -> 2n  In any event, probability doesn't seem particularly helpful, at least not in any obvious way."

mathematics,38cp4d,ben3141,14,Wed Jun 3 15:09:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know about Zhang's result, but I do know a bit about Fermat's Last Theorem. To go from college mathematics to a full understanding of the proof of FLT would be a serious undertaking.   The broad overview goes something like: from any potential counter-example to FLT, one gets an elliptic curve, known as a Frey Curve. By the modularity theorem, we obtain a modular form, and we then pass to the Galois representation associated to it. Using Ribet's theorem, this implies the existence of a weight 2 level 2 cusp form, which we know don't exist from the general theory of modular forms. QED.  What Wiles proved is the modularity theorem (previously known as the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture), and it concerns the connection between Elliptic curves and Modular forms. Even to understand the statement of this theorem I think would constitute a graduate level course. (I would suggest Diamond and Taylor's book A First Course in Modular Forms for this purpose. Fair warning: this book is hard.)  The other side of this is Ribet's theorem, which is used to generate the contradiction. This uses some fairly high level representation theory, about which I know very little. What I do know suggests that understanding this theorem and its proof requires a sophisticated understanding of the theory of Galois representations and of the general theory of modular forms.  Skimming over the intro from Wiles 1995 paper, its clear that one would need some background in \ell - adic Galois representations, Iwasawa theory, Galois cohomology and maybe some other things to actually understand the proof, as well as all the areas I have already mentioned.  This is a beautiful area of mathematics, and if you do choose to do this, I wish you the best of luck!"

mathematics,38cp4d,egdunne,2,Wed Jun 3 11:45:01 2015 UTC,"Zhang's proof is in the area of analytic number theory.  To understand Zhang's work, you would need to understand some complex analysis (Ahlfors, Complex Analysis), some real analysis (Rudin, Real and Complex Analysis, or Stein & Shakarchi, Real Analysis), some Fourier Analysis (Stein & Shakarchi, Fourier Analysis), and some analytic number theory (Easiest: Apostol's book, Middle: De Koninck and Luca's book, Hardest: Iwaniec & Kowalski).  Taking all this into account, if you really want to understand every line, you probably need to be at the level of a second-year grad student in mathematics.  Andrew Granville wrote up an account of Zhang's proof aimed at ""general mathematicians"" in the Bulletin of the AMS: Primes in intervals of bounded length.  Look at that and see how much of it you can follow.     Note:  I have only listed books I am familiar with.   There are plenty of other good choices out there."

If I had a library where you typed in a ""name"" of a book up to 3200 characters long and I gave you back a page with the same exact 3200 characters printed on it, of course I could claim that I have every single possible page of 3200 characters, since you're literally just typing in the page yourself. This would be kind of silly though, so there's some mathematical tricks used to make it look more impressive.  First, it looks like the input is base-36 encoded, but more importantly the author uses some sort of reversible hashing algorithm. Such an algorithm is designed to produce random looking, but deterministic output. This gives the illusion of randomness, but in the end it's still an algorithm generating the output. If you search for something random and look at the hex it's in, you'll see the hex name is extremely long -- this is the input to the algorithm along with the wall shelf etc.  Of course nothing is saved to disk. The about page says that explicitly and as you say that would be impossible. If the algorithm can generate the same exact page every time the same input is given in though, it gives the illusion that the page actually exists somewhere.

It IS a 50/50 chance for someone who walks into the room late and missed the whole 98 goats thing. However for us it isn't. We know that probability weights the unchosen door heavily in our favour.  Another way of looking at it is as if it were a coin flip. A stranger would be justified in saying the change of getting either side is 50/50, so he picks tails.   We know however that the coin is biased and actually has a 99% chance of giving heads, so we can make a more informed bet."

It happens that the constraint that f(x) = 0 for more than one x but only finitely many is rather loose and does not give a lot of information about the functions that satisfy it.  First of all: When defining a function three things are to be looked to: that the domain of the function (where the function ""comes from"") is defined, that the codomain of the function (where the function ""goes to"") is defined and that there is a specification of how the function relates the domain and codomain (that is, what the function is - its values at different points).  Sometimes, however, we don't specify the function's values but simply put some constraints on it: for instance that the function be continous, injective or some other crazy property and then derive results from that.  Of course, we can make statements about our class of functions that are equal to 0 more than once but never infinitely many times. For instance, any such function can not be injective (can you see why?).  Also (when working inside the real numbers) any polynomial with even degree and negative constant term is a member of our class of functions (this is indeed a lemma in Euler's ""proof"" of the fundamental theorem of algrebra)."

For the coupon collector problem, the math is actually fairly straightforward; if you have k out of the n items, the probability of getting a new one is (1-k/n), so the expected number of coupons needed for the next new one is one over that, at which point you can just sum those terms for all values of k (i.e., to get all n coupons takes an expected n/n + n/(n-1) + ... + n/2 + n/1 samples).  The problem in this case is that the probability is a function not just of how many coupons you have but also your distribution between rares and commons.  When you have 20 coupons, you need to compute a separate probability for each number of rares from 0 to 20, and compute both the probability of the next one being rare and then the next one being common to generate the probability distribution and expectations for all 21-coupon probabilities.  This is absolutely a thing that can be done, but it will involve a lot of bookkeeping and I suspect probably can't be done by hand (unless there are some simplifications that I'm missing).  You could write a computer program to track all the fiddly details, but I suspect its faster and easier to just write a simulation to estimate the answer."

These methods (Cochrane-Orcutt, Hidreth-Lu, Prais-Winston, etc.) iteratively estimate p (rho), the autocorrelation parameter. The estimation stops essentially when you get a non-significant DW statistic, so, to answer your question, yes.  Keep in mind, though, that classic DW tests for first order autocorrelation. More complicated correlation patterns may exist. Some tools that are useful in examining autocorrelation are ACF and PACF plots. As part of the Box-Jenkins estimation process for time series, these can suggest alternative models."
mathematics,35pwbm,the_banished,2,Tue May 12 18:52:57 2015 UTC,"So under the assumption that my data exhibits first-order autocorrelation, recalculating d after my Cochrane-Orcutt fit should result in an inconclusive or rejection level of DW, mean my fit has ""accounted for the autocorrelation""  If DW is still significant after my Cochrane-Orcutt fit, this could imply higher-order autocorrelation or some non-linear relationship?  And I'm trying to stick to simple tools right now in my analysis. I'm basically teaching myself some Time Series Analysis while trying to work on a real problem, so I want to work through the simple methods see what they tell me then move on to the more advanced ones if that makes sense.   Thanks for the help"
