Experienced golfers can enjoy it for some accuracy practice, but beginners can enjoy it because it's not incredibly difficult to at least reach the target."

golf,3e2wa4,hillegas,10,Tue Jul 21 15:23:09 2015 UTC,"I am going to give you 2 tips for your full golf swing. Keep in mind that the short game and putting are actually more important, but most people find practicing their full swing more fun. So that's what I'll give you.  Tip #1   One poster said to get several lessons. This is the best thing you can do to develop good habits BEFORE you ingrain bad habits. Please get at least 3 lessons with a certified PGA instructor. And you will be thanking yourself years from now.  When you look at golf swings on the PGA Tour, the critiques and differences in swings are very specific and minimal. BUT, what they all do well, is the basic fundamentals. A fair number of amatuers overlook this. The main ones are (in this order):   1.) Grip  2.) Alignment (includes club face, hands, body and feet)   3.) Weight distribution of your entire body  4.) Takeaway  These are things an instructor will be able to give you to get you started. If you can master these aspects of the golf swing, the rest will follow and you can start getting more into advanced things like swing theory.  Tip #2  The ball flight is the best indicator of your swing. Once you've mastered the basics above, you can use the ball flight to tell you how you're swinging. The direction the ball starts indicates your swing path. The direction your ball curves indicates the position of the clubface at impact.  Remember to have fun! That's honestly the best thing you can do right now. Don't get too down on yourself if you feel you aren't progressing fast enough. Happy golfing bud."
golf,3e2wa4,IHaveLargeBalls,4,Tue Jul 21 15:51:08 2015 UTC,I thought the new flight laws state that clubface at impact indicates direction that the ball starts and path indicates curve... do i have this backwards?
golf,3e2wa4,shaq_daddy,2,Tue Jul 21 18:01:59 2015 UTC,"From the side bar   In other words, you are saying that the face angle is by far the most dominating factor for the initial direction of the ball. Is this not in direct contradiction with the ""Ball Flight Laws""? Yes it is. According to the ""old"" ball flight laws, the initial direction of the ball (HLA) is 100% dictated by the club path. All the scientific people in the golf industry know that this is wrong, yet still a lot of PGA professionals use the incorrect 'old' ball flight laws in teaching. And many PGA organizations around the world do not teach their apprentice and member professionals according to the 'true' ball flight laws."
golf,3e2wa4,alldis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:20:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the side bar is quoting this website on Ball Flight Laws  It gets really technical, and for me I kind of agree with the way Faldo plays his shots (they use him as an example), which that website says is completely wrong. But it works for me, and the mental picture I have when I play that way works. Whatever gets you around in the fewest strokes, right?"
golf,3e2wa4,IHaveLargeBalls,3,Tue Jul 21 19:28:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with Tip #1 big time,  Fundamentals are crazy important and so easy to overlook (or get wrong).     Grip/Setup/Posture etc.   and Lessons."
golf,3e2wa4,TheKanim,2,Tue Jul 21 18:10:49 2015 UTC,"The direction the ball starts indicates your swing path. The direction your ball curves indicates the position of the clubface at impact.   That isn't 100% true. They are relative to one another. If your swing path is 2 degrees inside out, and you club face is 2 degrees open, you will get a slight push to the right, but the ball won't curve, even though your club face was open at impact. That's because the clubface angle and swing path are still perpendicular.   In this scenario, you could correct ONLY your swing path and still get a similar end result, but this time the shot will have faded slighty (curved). THis would make you think what you did has not worked, when in fact you are half way there."
golf,3e2wa4,Levesque77,0,Tue Jul 21 17:26:51 2015 UTC,"You're correct in noting that, in your scenario, the ball would be pushed right with no curve. And as I said, the ball flight shows clubface angle. Since the ball is traveling straight (albeit a 2 degree push to the right), your clubface angle matches (and is square to) your swingpath. Correcting the swingpath would result in a straight shot.   If you changed your clubface 2 degrees closed after changing the swingpath 2 degrees closed like you said you would need to, you would actually produce a shot that started straight, then drew 2 degrees."
golf,3e2wa4,IHaveLargeBalls,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:53:21 2015 UTC,Also... its backwards... Club FACE is the Primary influence on starting direction.  The combination of Face + Path.. Determines Curvature.
golf,3e2wa4,TheKanim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:55 2015 UTC,"I guess I was trying to oversimplify for someone new to the game. I read in Nicklaus and Hogan's books that if you swing extremely inside out with a closed clubface you would produce a big draw that starts right and curves back to the left for right handed players, same goes for the opposite. But you're more correct when you say that the combination determines curvature, especially when you get to smaller varying degrees like only slightly inside or outside and only slightly open or closed. Cheers."
golf,3e2wa4,IHaveLargeBalls,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:24:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  It gets tricky with wording.. ""closed relative to path""  will produce a right to left flight (a draw).    But depending how closed the club face is.. the ball could start out more to the right..  and ball draw back to center.    Or the ball could start left.. and hook/draw even further left.    I think the main point (in this now very confusing thread)  is that the way the face is pointing.. determines the initial line the ball will start on.    The path of the swing.. relative to that face angle..  is going to determine which spin you get.. from there."
golf,3e2wa4,TheKanim,0,Tue Jul 21 19:32:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to get into an argument about this, but that isn't correct. Either that or I'm misunderstanding you. If your club face is 2 degrees open and you have a perfectly straight swing path, the ball is fading.  If the two are not perpendicular, the shot is not straight. There will be curve if they do not form a 90 degree angle.  Edit: See this diagram http://www.golfswing.com.au/upload/images/BallFlight.jpg"
golf,3e2wa4,Levesque77,0,Tue Jul 21 18:12:00 2015 UTC,"Since the ball is traveling straight (albeit a 2 degree push to the right), your clubface angle matches (and is square to) your swingpath.    I'm not arguing with you. But what I said here is exactly what is in your diagram.   Push: Clubface square to in-to-out swing path. Ball starts right with no curve.   I'm sure many people here will appreciate the diagram, so thanks for linking that!  Edit: In your last comment, you've switched your scenario from both clubface and swing path being 2 degrees open, to    your club face is 2 degrees open and you have a perfectly straight swing path   which I'm thinking you mean perfectly square, or 0 degrees. But the ball flight would result in a curve, you are correct."
golf,3e2wa4,IHaveLargeBalls,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:31 2015 UTC,"In this scenario, you could correct ONLY your swing path and still get a similar end result, but this time the shot will have faded slighty (curved). THis would make you think what you did has not worked, when in fact you are half way there.   I didn't switch the scenario. It's the same one I used in the initial comment.   The direction the ball starts indicates your swing path. The direction your ball curves indicates the position of the clubface at impact.   This is the only comment from your original post I was correcting.   Also: as someone else mentioned, you have them backwards. Club face angle determines starting direction. The relative angle of swing path to face angle determines the curve. (I didn't notice that mistake at first, until /u/TheKanim mentioned it."

golf,3e2wa4,JokerMad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:37:25 2015 UTC,"I found that most of the reason I look up is because it took a while to get the ball off the ground and I wanted to see if they where going where I wanted them too so I didn't have long until the ball was on the ground again, but when I didn't care about looking at the ball it had a decent flight path and I could still watch it."
golf,3e2wa4,expenseit,3,Tue Jul 21 15:42:28 2015 UTC,"I am like you and took up golf later in my life, this being my 3rd summer of golfing. A few things that helped me, which you may already know are;   Look for the lie line on the club, most clubs have a little mark on the grip which shows you how the club should lie, make sure you have your thumbs pointed down towards that line. From my experience two reasons you will slice is either you are standing to close or to far from the ball, or most likely you are not timing your wrists correctly. When you wind up for a swing your wrists cock back, you need to time them to come back to the straight positions the second you hit the ball.    I have a friend who takes lessons and he told me that the teacher told him that most people who come in to fix their swing are just not timing their wrists correctly which results in a slice.   Practice, I go to the range a lot, and also practice my chipping in the park. You need to make your swing feel natural and not think about every little thing when your are getting ready to hit.   This stuff all worked for me and I shot 4 pars on 9 holes last time I went, something that seemed unlikely just a few weeks earlier."
golf,3e2wa4,DigitalPhear13,3,Tue Jul 21 15:52:30 2015 UTC,Practice. Get lessons.
golf,3e2wa4,karlgnarx,3,Tue Jul 21 16:17:11 2015 UTC,"Almost everyone slices at some point and good on you for wanting to work it out.   Seriously, just get a lesson or two (or more depending on your budget).   Golf is a difficult game, but you can save yourself a lot of headache if you get a professional to show you some fundamentals of the full swing. So, get a lesson, figure out what you need to work on (for the time being), get some practice in. Then, as your progress, get another lesson, work on another part of your game, practice, so on and so forth.   To make practicing on your own worthwhile, you need to at least get to a point to where you understand what you are trying to accomplish.  On the short game side, putting and chipping, I think you can learn a lot from watching a few videos and just putting in the practice time. This video from Jim Furyk has helped me a lot with chipping.   Golf is a lifelong game, enjoy!"
golf,3e2wa4,tripsssi,6,Tue Jul 21 16:30:22 2015 UTC,"Practice. Think of your swing as a riddle that must be figured out through trial and error. Every time, you strike one the way you like, you have a new clue."
golf,3e2wa4,tripsssi,3,Tue Jul 21 15:24:30 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to get to the range and watch YouTube videos, about 1 every 4 goes straight, like to thinks it's skill but probably luck."
golf,3e2wa4,DrHeckenstein,4,Tue Jul 21 15:26:18 2015 UTC,"Take your phone out to range, and watch instructional videos in between shots. If want to get rid of that slice quick, start thinking about swinging with your body and weight shift and less about swinging with your wrists and arms. Start your back swing without your arms at all, just turn your body. Start your down swing by bumping your front hip towards the target. Make sure both knees break towards the target. Try to finish with 110% of your weight on your front foot for any full swing."
golf,3e2wa4,Not-so-bad-,2,Tue Jul 21 15:27:34 2015 UTC,"The thing that helped me alot is to go out early in the morning or late evening when no one else is out. Just walk the course, if you hit a ball that youre not happy with throw out a new one. Take a lower club (if you used 8 iron, use a 7) and do a slower, more controlled swing.  I had the same problem as you. Nasty slice to the right.  I havent seen your swing, but for me it helped to keep my wrists straight and use a wee bit more hips in the swing."
golf,3e2wa4,Lyrneian,2,Tue Jul 21 16:36:06 2015 UTC,"Learn to hit the ball on the range at 90-95% power. Once you get on the course you can tone this down and feel like you have full control of your body during your swing.   Also, turn your bottom hand over (pretend to make your palm face the ground) and keep your back elbow tucked. Sounds much easier than it is."
golf,3e2wa4,thegreymane,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:57 2015 UTC,"Focus on the hole you're on. I have found that I linger on the last hole. If it was a good hole, I get over confident and screw up the hole I'm on. If it was bad, it gets in my head and I don't take my time.  It's true with a few people I've played with too.   Play with confidence, but don't get cocky and over confident in your skills.   Learn your average club distances and then trust your instincts with each shot and which club to use. I usually don't let anyone talk me into using a different club than what I'm using cause it typically ends in me screwing up the shot somehow cause I over thought it.   Those are my tips for you that have worked wonders for me. Also, foe the lining up part, you can aim your club to your target and line up your body accordingly. I like to put my club parallel with my hips so I can line up with no second guessing. That's not a very good explanation, but I'm sure there are videos somewhere that explain it better.   Good luck!"

golf,3e2wa4,Levesque77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:37:37 2015 UTC,"Don't start.  Haha! Just kidding. First thing though, and I know everyone says it and it's totally cliché, but take a few basic lessons  on the full swing, putting, chipping and pitching. Yes, I know lessons are a little pricey, but trust me, it's the best investment you can make in your game and you will save yourself a lot of grief and enjoy the game more. Second thing is to really be patient. Golf is very difficult, but not impossible. On your bad days (and you will have a lot of them) just try to relax and enjoy just being out on the course. Laugh off your bad shots, relax and try to have fun."
golf,3e2wa4,IllestRolla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:24 2015 UTC,"Understanding how swing path and club face angle work together helped me to correct my own slice by making my own adjustments.

(keep in mind, they are generalizations. there are differing degrees of each element that can produce less drastic results and actually be a good thing if you are trying to shape the ball.)"

Some people (particularly high handicappers) might be able to make a drastic improvement, and you can improve quickly if you dedicate yourself and practice intelligently.    However, an across the board claim like ""cut your handicap in half in 30 days"" is like ""make $2000 dollars a day in just hours working from home!"".

golf,3e3swl,aithosrds,2,Tue Jul 21 19:13:53 2015 UTC,"You would have to start with an awfully high handicap for that to be possible.  It's 30 days of multiple lessons a day.

golf,3e3swl,NotSoUsual,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:50 2015 UTC,"It's highly unlikely, regardless of what your handicap is.  This is something I've said repeatedly on various posts and forums and it applies in this case:  There is no magic tip, trick or drill that you can use to drastically improve your golf game.  If you're not improving currently then inserting some new drills is not going to cut your handicap in half.    The only way to cut your handicap in half is to play more, practice smarter, and have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of the golf swing and course management.  That's it.  If you're playing once a week and hitting the range one a week you're not going to halve your handicap no matter what you try.  If you're playing twice a week and hitting the range 5 days a week but you're just mindlessly pounding balls and drinking your way around the course...same deal.  Improving at golf takes mental focus, knowledge, dedication, time and a commitment to getting better.  It also takes an increasing (and escalating) amount of talent the lower your handicap gets, and a fair amount of passion on top of that..."

golf,3dz8i9,tarhawk,4,Mon Jul 20 19:02:24 2015 UTC,"Zach is a really cool guy, and it sucks that people seem to have poor opinions of him, even if it is anecdotal evidence. My family supported him while he was on the Hooters/mini tours and honestly I don't have a single negative thing to say about him. Of course I have a biased view but I've been to dozens of events and have seen him been more than generous and respectful with his time when it comes to interacting with fans/kids. For example after his first tour win at the BellSouth he signed hats for kids for 5-6 minutes on the green with a giant smile on his face. I've never seen a pro do it for that long after any event.  Two things I think might lead to some odd interactions/negative opinions.   First, players can't meet and greet with/have a positive interaction with every member of the public. On countless occasions I've seen fans get mad/show disdain because a pro didn't reach out a hand or sign something. Once I was standing next to a guy who said ""good luck"" to Retief Goosen. Goosen didn't acknowledge it at all, and the guy went ""fuck that guy."" Sometimes this stuff isn't even that a player is actively ignoring, but just didn't realize someone was trying to give them something to sign or have a hand out. Most of the time though there has to be a line, sometimes it is a certain number of items to sign after winning an event, pictures, or sometimes it is just ignoring stuff. Golf produces a level of closeness with players that is pretty special, but at the end of the day you have realize a) they are out there competing or b) if they aren't competing they are human and there is a limit to how much they can take. For every player on the tour there are hundreds of stories about them not being able to sign something or what have you, and a few of those are going to be from people who don't understand the above, and take it personal. It isn't personal, and you shouldn't get upset.   Second is more based on knowing Zach. Zach can have a certain level of aloofness to him, but I wouldn't call it arrogant at all. If anything he is too humble, and that might turn people off. I guess here I mean I've seen Zach act very casually towards people I assume he didn't know well or at all. As far as being rude to staff of local clubs or similar to fans, I've never seen it. Can he be short, yes, but again everyone has to be at times. Being short and being casual could potentially get interpreted as being a dick, but knowing Zach as well as I do I know that he doesn't think of himself any higher than anyone else that walks the course on a Sunday.  Don't take my word for it though. Zach is universally liked on the tour, and these guys definitely make an opinion on each other based on how they treat fans, because they see it week in and week out.   Edit-- I guess for the people who claim to have meet Zach 3-4-5 times and he was a ""dick"" every time, why would you keep wanting to meet him? I'm assuming there are other pros you could go get a signature from or talk to, and all it would take for me to not want to meet a pro again is one bad experience."

There is no disrespect to Zach Johnson. It's just a fact based on his old interviews that the guy does not have a ""passion"" for golf. He has tons of talent and made a success of himself with that talent. Not the same as ""passion.""  Edit 2 (from his Feherty episode): Asked by Feherty if he loves golf, Johnson replied, “I played all these team sports … and I loved them, but they passed me by. The prowess, the speed and everything that goes along with that. So golf kind of picked me.”"

Do you at least see my point? It's a payoff for all of Johnson's hard work. Some folks might cry after studying 100 hours and getting an A+ on a major test. That doesn't mean they have a passion for studying or test taking. I've seen old interviews with Zach Johnson where he's basically says 'I play golf. Can't complain but I also don't LOVE the game.'   Same with Boo Weekley. From what I've read/seen he'd rather be fishing/hunting than playing golf. Believe it or not there are PGA Tour players who have natural talent for the game and are not die hard enthusiastic ""passionate"" for the game. They just have the talent to make a damn good living playing."

golf,3e2gww,bl1ndvision,33,Tue Jul 21 16:00:00 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, people freak out WAY too much about this ""rule"" to begin with.  People do realize there were countless groups stomping all over the greens right before you, right?  and ESPECIALLY due to the fact that the greens in most pro tournaments are much harder/faster than the regular greens the average Joe is putting on.  I doubt a footprint from Spieth would have even been visible after he stepped away...let alone affect Day's line or the trajectory of the ball.    Yes, I always follow golf etiquette and stay out of people's lines whenever possible, but for someone to get all upset about it is a little bit silly."
golf,3e2gww,Pensky,7,Tue Jul 21 14:36:09 2015 UTC,"I always feel it's a little bit similar to how some people lose their minds when others aren't playing Blackjack ""correctly"".  I'm of the mind that it feels more important to just stay as far away from the edge of the hole as possible. Someone stepping in my line 30 feet away from the hole seems minor, but heavy steps close to the hole, where ball momentum is at its lowest, seems more problematic."

golf,3e2gww,eastbay_ak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:46:20 2015 UTC,It depends on the greens. I have without a doubt walked on a soft green and seen a very noticeable imprint from my shoe. Most of the time the effect is low to none. Instead of trying to guess when it will and won't affect the putt it's just easier and common courtesy to not walk in someone's line. At the very least if they see it is going to be a distraction to them.
golf,3e2gww,bl1ndvision,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:44 2015 UTC,"I disagree somewhat. Golf is such a mental game that even the most trivial things can affect your score, including someone walking in your line. I'm sure it through his mind for a loop."
golf,3e2gww,bl1ndvision,0,Tue Jul 21 19:22:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's more of a respect thing.  If it did happen, Day knows that Speith knows its disrespectful, but did it anyways."
golf,3e2gww,yrogerg123,5,Tue Jul 21 14:46:02 2015 UTC,"I agree it's a respect thing.  Sort of like having the player with the best score on the last hole tee off first on the next hole.    As we all know, there are a million written and unwritten rules of golf, some of them simply boil down to ""etiquette"" and don't affect the end result or scores.  I think walking in someone's line is one of those rules.    I've golfed with people who have freaked out because someone else (usually a beginner who didn't know any better) walked in their line, and these are often the same guys who won't fix their ball marks on the green.  That is a much, much more egregious issue."
golf,3e2gww,murderous_rage,3,Tue Jul 21 14:48:52 2015 UTC,Good point.  To be honest whenever I play with friends we really don't follow the best score on the last hole goes first unless we're playing for money.  It is usually just who gets there first.

golf,3e3vxp,TedMcGriff,3,Tue Jul 21 19:54:10 2015 UTC,Yeah true but you are able to join the club with any handicap I believe and then you have to be a certain level to play for the team but I will be there for 5 years so a goal to work towards :)
golf,3e3vxp,Meowingtons-PhD,3,Tue Jul 21 19:57:00 2015 UTC,"A 20 handicap means you're scoring low-90s on good days.  At least in the U.S., you need to be scoring in the 70s to have a chance to play at the smallest, least-competitive colleges that probably aren't giving out big scholarships.  To get into a top school, you'd need to be scoring in the 60s regularly on your average, non-championship golf course.  However, many schools offer club sports or intramural sports purely for student recreation that would have much lower (if any) standards for joining/participating."

golf,3e301e,YesIamaWizard,2,Tue Jul 21 15:50:20 2015 UTC,"I don't have a video, but my process is pretty simple and it's helped me exponentially after I've gamed it.  From practice, I've learned how hard I need to hit the ball for 3, 5, 10, etc. paces.  When I'm on the course, I'll pace out from my ball to the hole, all while taking into account the undulations on the green.  Up/downhill, sideways, etc.   Then I'll get back to my ball, pace count in mind, and point the logo/line on the ball to the line the ball should take to the cup.  I literally hold the ball to the cup (from my eye) and trace the line I want the ball to go.  So now, when I'm standing over my ball, I know the stroke I need to put on it from my pacing and I know the line from my read.  Then I combine the two and hope for the best.  If there's an up/downhill, I'll add/reduce the number of paces in my mind accordingly, keeping in mind that I'm just trying to make square contact and put the ball on the path I read.  When I'm reading the line of the putt, the easiest way to learn the way a ball will break is to imagine which direction a water thrown from a bucket will break towards.  The ball will follow the same line as water falling to gravity as long as you don't putt through it too hard.  Also, lag putting and speed control are so much better than trying to drain everything from really far away.  Do you best to get any putt more than 20' into a nice little 3' circle for an easy 2 putt."

golf,3e28nb,AlternateFire1,8,Tue Jul 21 11:55:29 2015 UTC,"They sell those training sticks that have the goofy loose flex and big yellow/orange ball at the end, or the one that has the hinge in the shaft and snap if your 'timing' is off... those are supposed to help you time your release better, you can google Medicus driver and it has the same idea, but if you want to work on timing, a good tool I've seen used is just going to the used club section, and find a women's and senior flex club that has a really bendy shaft.    You can pay $10 for one of those, and because it has so much flex, it's similar to the products above.  You say you shoot in the 80s so you have to have decent swing speed, the key to the women's/senior flex is that you can't swing 100% and hit it right, so it makes you slow your swing down and learn to just make contact, as you swing it, you should be able to feel when your release is correct when the shaft kicks the right way and you have a good ball flight.  Remember, this is a drill just to work on timing. After you hit some balls with that, try going to some of your other clubs and see if it helps.  You'll be swinging harder because your flex will be stiffer, but you should have a better feel for when your release should be with your hands.  Besides that, keep the L, lead with the hands release as your turn, wrap the toe around the ball and follow through to the target, and if none of that works... just grip it and rip it!"

golf,3e3p95,Pappy091,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:45 2015 UTC,"I really just want to play. I feel like getting better is a natural progression when you get out there and get in your rhythm. I'm definitely more fond of playing a round of golf than to hit balls on a range. While going alone can be very relaxing on occasion, having it be my only option gets pretty boring pretty fast."
golf,3e3p95,aithosrds,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:51:12 2015 UTC,"I went through a period of time without much ""fun"" money and took up fishing for most of the summer.  $19 for an annual license, then a few bucks in bait every day would keep me busy.  Not nearly as fun as golf, and I did go out a few times that year.    Golf CAN be a very expensive sport, but it doesn't HAVE to be.  I scour Groupon or GolfNow for deals, play Twilight hours, or whatever I gotta do.    It sounds like your biggest problem may be that you've lost your golfing pals.  I have to admit, playing a round by myself from time-to-time is relaxing and a great ""escape"", but I wouldn't trade that for golfing in a foursome with 3 of my closest friends.  Nothing in the world beats that.    You have any friends/coworkers/acquaintances in the area that play?  There's ALWAYS someone looking for a golf partner."

golf,3e3uk4,haCOONa_matata,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:06 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not an expert or anything but I'd say that changing your grips can absolutely have an impact.  I've thought about switching to midsize myself, I have very long fingers and a lot of times I feel my grip is ""cramped"" and unnatural.  I know I would adjust over time but I don't really want to take a big step backwards in the middle of a season either.  I did the same thing with the length when I ordered my new set, the fitter realize that where I was hitting on the club was a setup issue and not length or lie.  I ended up with 1/4"" long and standard lie even though I'm 6'4 and most people my height are closer to an inch long and several degrees upright.  If you think about it: your hands are your only point of contact with the club.  It's a minor change, but now your hands are in a different position around the grip.  So what your muscle memory (subconscious) thinks about where the club is and should go is different than what the feedback is and it will take time to adjust..."

I have a sneaking feeling the course owner was tired of the geese shitting on the greens and asked these locals to take care of them.  I would also imagine the owner didn't think they would be so blatant in their geese removal.  We have a geese problem on one of my local courses and their shit will kill the green.  But I certainly don't believe this is the right way to take care of it.

This may be illegal, and arguably unethical, but given the amount of goose poop I step in/hit out of/clean off of my shoes/clubs in a given round, it would be hard not to cheer if I saw this happen on the golf course."

golf,3e2g4o,TedMcGriff,4,Tue Jul 21 14:44:18 2015 UTC,"Um yea... I guess other things that ""annoy"" me about geese would be the widespread agricultural damage they cause (including to golf course turf grasses), their spreading of human pathogens to waterways (including drinking water reservoirs), and their causing algae blooms that damage native fish populations.  Canadian geese have been excessively protected and are wildly overpopulated in many areas, including the location where this occurred.  But yea, driving a little poop collector around the golf course would solve all these problems I'm sure."
golf,3e2g4o,poopfeast,2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:03 2015 UTC,There are other solutions to solve that problem rather than walking around and blasting them with shotguns on a public golf course and leaving their corpses to float in the water.
golf,3e2g4o,ugmonk,2,Tue Jul 21 15:51:29 2015 UTC,"Until you can talk to them to tell them to leave, there's not much chance of it.

golf,3e2gdt,Ozarkian,6,Tue Jul 21 13:12:38 2015 UTC,Let your legs start the downswing. It's pretty hard to overswing when your arms are being pulled by your legs/core.   But being a baseball player if you can get that feeling and timing down when you're close to the ball and release point you can use all that power to really smash through it.
golf,3e2gdt,CaveBacon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:29:10 2015 UTC,This might also explain why my swing speed is 75. All arms.
golf,3e2gdt,t3h_rival,4,Tue Jul 21 18:52:33 2015 UTC,"Tempo is so essential to a complete golf game and yet it is one of the hardest concepts to grasp. I would recommend making your way to the range with this drill. Pick a club you feel comfortable hitting. I personally would pick a 7 iron. I typically hit my 7 iron about 165 yards. First you need to pick a target on the range, I want you to pick a target that is going to be 20 yards short the iron you will be hitting. With this short target in mind, i want you to swing with 70% effort, i don't want you to reduce your swing, i just want you to swing at a relaxed pace. Your mind should be at ease knowing that you have plenty of club in your hands to make it to your distance and should naturally help you slow down your tempo.   Again, 70% effort, does not mean reduced take away! Also, make sure you are still accelerating through the downswing. If you find that you are hitting shots fat, it is probably due to deceleration.  If you are still find that you are struggling, reduce your target distance by 30 yards and also reduce your swing to a half swing with 70% effort and work your way up from there.  best of luck"
golf,3e2gdt,e11310,2,Tue Jul 21 15:17:07 2015 UTC,"It's hard to go against natural tempo. Some people just have a really naturally aggressive transition and others have super smooth ones. The harder you try to fight it, the more it's going to mess up your swing.  In terms of the actual swing mechanics, you need to swing as hard as you can while being able to maintain balance. So if you find yourself falling over after a swing, you're swinging too hard.  I found a good way to get into a good tempo is to start slow at the range. Grab something like a 9 iron and just start with chips to 10 yards. Work up 10 yards at a time and eventually when you get to a full swing, you should have a nice tempo going."

golf,3e2gdt,WeaponX434,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:33:17 2015 UTC,"I always did a drill where I hit balls without my shoes on. Hit balls in bare feet will keep you from over swinging because you will bruise your toes. Make sure you choke up or you will hit fat all day. Also, make sure you keep your arms ""locked"" to your torso. If you swing with the chest and not your arms/hands it is harder to overswing."
golf,3e2gdt,ssracer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:51:01 2015 UTC,"Stand with your feet together in a ""V"" shape with your heels touching and take a few swings like that.

Similar to the triple crown that happened recently, a large majority of the american population had no idea who american pharaoh was but after the triple crown the recognition of american Pharaoh went through the roof.   Not very many non-golfers know of Jordan Speith but if you name drop tiger woods almost everyone knows who you're talking about golfer or not.

Most of the Pros are pretty slender and wear the euro fit; which has slimmer shoulders and side cut.

Favorites are Dunning slim fits and the RLX shirts that are 92 poly 8 elasatine. Kind of a sleeper shirt though...go to Dillards and find their ""Murano"" stuff. A few of the Murano Performance shirts have material and cut equal to RLX at around half the price.   I love (sarcasm) the under armour shirts that are catagorized as ""loose"" that fit like gloves on the adonis mannequins in store.....if you get closer you can see the the scrunch up clip thing pulling everything together in the back of the shirt...

golf,3e2zww,troth0,4,Tue Jul 21 15:49:25 2015 UTC,About six months. Drained a 15 footer downhill I had no business making lol.
golf,3e2zww,DigitalPhear13,2,Tue Jul 21 16:13:07 2015 UTC,About 3 years. I dropped it from 100 yards out after slicing the past two shots. I assumed that I overshot it or someone else picked it up when I got to the green and didn't see it there. My friend finishes his put and asks me why me ball is in the cup if I'm still putting. It took a minute for me to realize what happened.
golf,3e2zww,xolieo,2,Tue Jul 21 16:31:52 2015 UTC,"Took 8 months or so for me. However, yesterday, my wife, in only her 4th round ever, hit a driver off the tee on a middle length par 3 (120 or so from the women's, was off about 15 yards to the right, and freaking chipped in for birdie. I was ecstatic... and a bit pissed."
golf,3e2zww,operatorasfuck5814,2,Tue Jul 21 17:09:45 2015 UTC,First round. Chased the Dragon for a long while after that.  160 yard par 3 downhill. I used a 5 iron lol (on a hole I use my 9 iron on now) and then hit a 15 foot putt. My friend who shoots in the 70s was with me just saying that I better make this putt. I did.
golf,3e2zww,JLM268,2,Tue Jul 21 17:34:41 2015 UTC,First eagle happened before first birdie. Drained a 6i from 140 out my 5th 9 I played. Total fluke.

golf,3e2zww,topper_mango,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:58 2015 UTC,"About a year.  Sank a 45 foot putt on a par three.  Knowing that it was likely the longest putt that I would ever make, I took the time to count the number of steps to the hole.  Complete blind luck.  I didn't bother lining it up or anything.  I just smacked the ball in the general direction of the hole and it went in."

Probably not going to happen anytime soon."

golf,3e1hz4,Navlax,3,Tue Jul 21 06:03:51 2015 UTC,Pro shops are aware of this and may offer you a paid fitting service. I know my local will test your swing speeds and lie for $65 bucks for the half hour of testing. Give you the results and you do what you want with it.   Or you can buy clubs online and take them in for new grips or to have them bent to your lie angle etc. they can insert plugs to lengthen shafts as well if required.

I've checked with a buddy's rangefinder and it's always no more than 5-10 yards off which is fine for a high handicap player like me.  As far as I know, it can't measure swing speed.  I've overall been very pleased with mine."
golf,3e1yz3,PM_ME_TACO,2,Tue Jul 21 13:51:18 2015 UTC,"I also have a Sony sw3 and here's what I found out. Currently only golfshot supports Android wear with gps built in (1year pro membership comes with sw3) however, battery lasts only 4.5-5 hrs with gps on. It's good for one round but I'm usually left with 5-10% battery when I'm done. Also golfshot app only lets you put in #of strokes(no putt count, fairway,gir). If you don't mind using your phone gps, hole 19 works well, but only gives you the distance to the green(no hazard distance or map). Hole 19 lets you put in putting count too. Swing by swing lets u put in everything on the watch but doesn't work with sw3 yet, I asked the support and they said they don't have any plan for it yet. I ended up using Gamegolf app which doesn't support Android wear yet but makes it fun to review your stats and see how your friends played."

Weak. Was painfully obvious that fox thought, hey, our sideline candy seems to work for NFL, why not golf too.   Now, I am not saying post round interviews should be winning Pulitzer Prizes or anything, but that crap fox pulled was just horrible.

And all of his interviews lately have been about whether he can match Hogan or win the slam. What do you want from him? I would be a little hesitant to say a lot.

All in all it is a personal preference, a 3 iron today IMO is considered to be the players iron, meaning people who play a traditional 3 iron mean business  But some advice when you buy your 3 hybrid, spend a few extra bucks getting the shaft cut down if you need to so you can hit it square(AND ALOT EASIER), the jet speeds were made in bulk and not meant for everyone of a certain height(unless you are tall), should cast 10-20 bucks including the service and new grip"

I unfortunately don't get enough time to play on a regular basis (Utah gets too hot for mid-day golf and I struggle waking up at dawn) so remembering which clubs I hit at each distance is a struggle for me from season to season. I'll be honest that I'm not always consistent either. Knowing my father paid $200 for his skycaddie and another $100 for 3 years of its service makes the price of this hurt a little less when I get that same functionality and more."

It's another to just walk around and casually miss putts here and there. Plus, the way he essentially gave up today left a really bad taste in my mouth.  I'm SURE he's more competitive than most folks I know, and he's obviously one of the great athletes in the game. But I'm going to root more for him if its clear how much he wants it.   Honestly, and I say this cautiously knowing the rumors about his drug use in the past, he looked like people I know who have taken strong anti-depressants.

golf,3e0x7y,Potato_Soup_,3,Tue Jul 21 02:44:00 2015 UTC,"a good place to start is ball position in your stance. your 8-9 irons should be about halfway between both feet in your stance, and 4-7 should be progressively closer to your front foot, with the 4 about 25% of the way from your front to back foot.   I don't have any other tips except to just practice more and more. Eventually you'll get to the point where fairway iron shots are easy."

golf,3e0x7y,jordansideas,2,Tue Jul 21 02:54:59 2015 UTC,"no problem. Actually I just thought of another tip I use on the course regularly. I find that my easiest fairway shot is a nice, easy pitching wedge from about 100 yards away. I always hit it with good tempo and straight. Now, I often just pretend that I'm doing that same shot, just with a different club for other iron fairway shots."
golf,3e0x7y,CheddersB,2,Tue Jul 21 02:58:01 2015 UTC,This is a great tip. When I'm further away and using a long iron I feel I need to hit it harder. When I just let the club and loft do the work I hit it much better.

I'll struggle  because I'm trying to 'pick' the ball VS allowing a divot to happen and allowing myself to swing down and through the ball for better impact. That is just me, not sure if you might be doing the same thing."
golf,3e0x7y,driswalker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:00 2015 UTC,Yes this is 100% me. I can always hit the ball perfectly because my club is going under the ball.
golf,3e0x7y,brickwall314,2,Tue Jul 21 15:30:28 2015 UTC,"if I'm in the rough I can hit it no problem, but I cannot seen to make good contact while on shorter grass   If you are the kind of player that hits on on the ball, or sweeps it off the ground, lush lies will probably be much easier to play from as it is easier to get the club underneath the ball. From what you describe, the most likely culprit is your angle of attack at impact. On the fairway, are your divots before or after the ball postion... or are there no divots?"
golf,3e0x7y,NotSoUsual,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:19:57 2015 UTC,Yes I do hit better on the rough because my club can hit under the ball. My divots are usually before the ball.
golf,3e0x7y,AmassXP,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:35:40 2015 UTC,there's the problem. your divot should start right at the position of the ball. your club should strike down on the ball and then brush through the grass after

golf,3e0x7y,AmassXP,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:57:58 2015 UTC,This is the secret to proper iron play.  It requires a proper weight transfer to get your club bottoming out (i.e. making a divot) after the ball.
golf,3e0x7y,lawhog84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:35:03 2015 UTC,How should I transfer my weight? Right to left foot?
golf,3e0x7y,KPA49,2,Tue Jul 21 15:33:34 2015 UTC,"What typically happens after impact? Do you hit it fat? Thin? Top?  Someone mentioned ball position. They're leading you in the right direction as the proper ball positioning can fix all of the above issues.   With an iron, you aren't sweeping or picking the ball cleanly off the deck. You are hitting down on and compressing the ball, using the loft of the club to send it in the air. Essentially, you are swinging down at a point about a ball width in front the ball. You should be taking a divot inches after where you impacted the ball.   Now, with that being said, I only use 3 different ball positions for all shots. For my driver, I tee it up directly out from the inside of my left heel. For fairway woods, hybrids, and 5-7 irons, I will move it toward my right foot 1 ball width from my driver positioning. 8, 9, PW, GW, SW, & LW will be played from the middle of my stance, which is 1 ball width to the right of my fairway wood position. This enables you to hit down and through the ball without topping, hitting it fat, or catching it thin.   The position of your feet go along with this as well. This graph is the perfect way to explain how your feet should be set for each shot. Do NOT pay attention to the ball placement, just look at the feet.   http://imgur.com/qtAk3HJ"
golf,3e0v4n,jordansideas,6,Tue Jul 21 02:26:17 2015 UTC,"I was taught that you should play tees based on handicap:  Forward tees (Ladies) are for >24  Middle tees (White) are for 12-24  Back tees (Blue) are for <12  If there are additional tees adjust handicaps, but the ""tips"" are generally for under 8. I believe some places in force this (I want to say Sweden does)."
golf,3e0v4n,fastbeemer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:51:39 2015 UTC,Do you really suggest that men with a handicap greater than 24 play the women's tees?  I know a few rangers that would skin you alive for playing from the reds.
golf,3e0v4n,thesneakywalrus,4,Tue Jul 21 20:25:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like a broken record, but mostly the tees are set up for your HANDICAP, not how far you can drive. With your scores in the high 90's, you SHOULD be hitting from the white tees. Next time you are at the club you should ask the pro what the handicaps by tee box are, or perhaps it's on the scorecard as it is in many places.   Play to your handicap, your score will be more accurate, and when you start scoring 'too low,' THEN move back to the blues."

golf,3e0v4n,IKillerBee,2,Tue Jul 21 02:54:45 2015 UTC,"For me it was a decision regarding what club I'm hitting my approach with. If I'm hitting a feel shot on a par 4 for my second shot then the tees are too close. If on a par 5 laying up is the dumb option for my second shot then I'm too close. However, my dad always says that if you're not breaking 80 regularly from the forward tees then they are still plenty challenging."

golf,3e0v4n,brickwall314,2,Tue Jul 21 02:39:47 2015 UTC,"Like if you have to hit a wedge but not a full swing. Something in the range of less than 100 yards is generally a feel shot, where you have to ""feel"" how hard you have to hit the ball."

I mean, everyone has their ""regular"" tee box, but its fun to move forward and back for the odd game to force different looks and to make you hit different clubs/shots. I'm about a 6 Hcp so will typically play black or blue but when playing with some friends that are just starting, I'll move up and play red or white or a combo and although you're typically a few strokes better, it changes the course/tee shots so much, it makes you think.   edit: not to mention, if the course is properly rated, you can apply your index to the rating and still get a ""proper"" score."
golf,3e0v4n,newmancrew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:51 2015 UTC,"I'm with pretty much everyone else: if you're shooting high 90s you should not be playing the tips.  The tee boxes have nothing to do with how far you hit the ball, they are set up to control pace of play and are roughly based on handicap.  If you play the tips and hit 4 times before getting on the green instead of 2 times then you're taking at least twice as long per hole and slowing everyone else down.  Until you can shoot in the 70s on a good day and low 80s on a bad day you shouldn't be playing the tips.    There is no reason at all for it, you will improve a lot more if you're hitting more quality shots (less club)..."

Although, I think you're seriously underestimating how much of an impact free distance would have on your game.  You already saw that you shot a significant number of strokes lower moving up one tee box, it would be an even bigger gain moving up again.  The difference between the back two is much smaller on most courses than from the second tees to the women's.  On my course it's only 300 yards from the back to the second tees, it's 700 from the second to the seniors and 800 to the women's.  Going from the tips to the womens is 1100 yards, that's 60 yards per hole on average.    Think about that for a second... 60 yards, and not just any 60 yards - 60 yards that's NEVER in a bad position and will often give you a better angle off the tee.  It wouldn't be nearly as hard as you think shooting par from that distance, at that point you're basically playing a 9 hole executive course (5500 yards)."
golf,3e0v4n,ssracer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:58:11 2015 UTC,"The takeaway is this: you don't move back until the tees you're playing on are too easy.  If you're not able to easily break 80 and shoot close to par on a good day then the tees aren't too easy.    How far up you choose to go is up to you.  If you feel stupid playing women's tees: don't play them.  You shouldn't feel bad about moving up though, it doesn't make you less manly.  I've seen guys playing seniors tees on the course, you know what I think?  ""I'm glad that guy is conscious of pace of play and isn't making me wait while he hacks it up from the tips.""  The kicker is this:  you don't learn anything by playing beyond your ability, you're going to have to hit big drives and leave yourself long irons and you're not going to get any practice with your mid irons and scoring clubs.  You would improve a LOT faster if you moved up and got good with the easier to hit clubs.  The easier the club is to hit, the more consistent your ball-striking will be and the better you'll learn to hit your longer clubs.  The harder a club is to hit the less consistent you'll be and the longer it will take you to improve, if you improve at all..."

He also shot a +1, so it was really fun to be competitive on this level.    My bogey on Hole 4 was SO avoidable...after a great 6i save from the fescue on my drive, I set myself up for a seemingly easy 100 yard shot...unfortunately,  I couldn't stick my PW to the very small green (divot was spot on, pin height) and it rolled off against the collar...duffed the chip and left myself with a 20' putt and then 2 putt for the bogey.  The bogey on 6 should've been a double because I duffed a chip after JUST missing a 120 yard PW that hit the false front and came down to a collection area at the front of the green which left me with a very steep uphill chip..thankfully I drained a miracle putt after getting it up there.  After that, I was automatic...Hole 7 I lipped out an eagle (330 cart path assisted drive, 9i 130 yards to the green...if I used an 8 it may have tracked very close...it had the line), hole 8 I stuck the pin height with my 3h for a 15' birdie chance (pin was at 185 for all you club distance whores out there), and hole 9 I 2 putted from 35' away.    I'm thrilled I was able to give myself a shot at a legitimate par breaking 9...absolutely cannot wait to get out again, if you couldn't tell!

If you're 1 / 2 putting for bogey or worse, chances are the shot that put you on the green was from pretty close to the green and if your short game doesn't suck, that should put you in position for a makeable 1st putt / tap in 2nd putt.

golf,3dy9aj,Rcg2005,3,Mon Jul 20 20:13:14 2015 UTC,"Probably one of the most hated rules in golf... but rulings compare it to finding your ball in a divot or in a footprint in the bunker.  ""Play the course as you find it"" has always been a foundation of golf.  It is only in recent (the last 50 or so) years that marking the ball on the green, fixing ball-marks, etc, have become acceptable under the rules.  Edit:  I want to add that I think these rules survive probably to encourage continued proper etiquette.  If you could repair all spike marks and drop from bunker foot-prints, would the players in front of you care as much about fixing their damage after they complete the hole?"

golf,3dxqq5,damagement,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:40:15 2015 UTC,"I think the K15 is the most forgiving Ping driver ever with the G15 a close second. In the quest for distance I'd say that the G25 and G30 are not that forgiving, but in terms of the longer lower spinning drivers that have become all the rage, they are still very much on the forgiving end of the spectrum."

golf,3dzua2,hailtoredskins,5,Mon Jul 20 21:35:01 2015 UTC,"I may be biased, as I'm a younger and less-experienced player, but I thought Fox's coverage was the best because it was accessible. I thought ESPN was just okay, I would've preferred some more shot angles, and to be honest I appreciated the amount of ProTracer that Fox used.  People say golf is an aging sport, and I honestly think that more coverage like Fox's can attract a wider, younger audience.  EDIT: I accidentally a word."
golf,3dzua2,HelpAmBear,3,Tue Jul 21 00:46:57 2015 UTC,"Fox's coverage of the U.S. Open was pitiful.  I mainly watched the online stream, and half of the time the tracer didn't work and the graphics were wrong.  The commentary was poor as well because it was mostly comments that were too critical or just plain bad.  For example, I forget who said it, but one commentator said, ""that ball will funnel all the way down away form the hole...actually it won't.""  Overall comments were just poor.  I'm glad I didn't watch the TV coverage because I already hate Joe Buck since I'm a Packers fan and have to deal with that guy for half the NFL season.  I enjoy ESPN's coverage of the Open, especially the short specials they air around commercials.  CBS and NBC have always had the best coverage in my opinion.  The cleanness and ad-free appearance of the Masters every year is one of my favorite things in golf."
golf,3dzua2,RJStrasser,3,Tue Jul 21 02:15:15 2015 UTC,the 1 hour of Open coverage where Peter Aliss sits in with the ESPN crew is the best of the year
golf,3dzua2,greatgolferhugeass,5,Tue Jul 21 00:16:21 2015 UTC,"Commentary -  Third.  Fox: commentary was terrible, no one should let Joe Buck near a golf course.    Second.  ESPN - Paul Azinger almost ruined the British; he was just insufferable.  I mean can Disney not find someone a little more likable?  Paul, we know that Tiger sucks now, but look at your record and you didn't do SHIT after 1993, when you were 33.  Pot, meet kettle.  First.  CBS - Wins that by default just by not doing anything obscene.  Producing - I'm so tired of ESPN and CBS showing only the putts at the end of major championships.  We know these guys can putt, but I don't need to watch Jason Day clean up another 2 footer.  However, I really started liking the pro-tracer on Fox because their shotmaking is truly incredible.  It is interesting to see the lines these guys take to dominate a golf course or the shape of DJ's bombs off the tee.  I would have loved to see the shot shape of Oosthuizen's approach on 17 in regulation today.  It seemed he smashed a total laser into the green.    Third.  CBS - Its probably not their fault, Augusta National is a bunch of stuffy dicks but the coverage style is always the same and the featured groups online rarely have interesting people.  Second.  ESPN - Good amount of coverage of many golfers and were able to show interesting shots and catch the hot people.  Coverage time was phenomenal, love golf being on from 3am to 3pm.  First.  Fox- Had trouble following the ball but I'll blame that at the horrible venue.  I loved the protracer.  I think they could get better and they also had a great amount of coverage with FS1.  I'll give them a win based on potential and willingness to try new things."

So my advice is to think carefully about your course management before your shot and then switch your brain off, if your brain isn't switched off don't hit the ball"

golf,3dykjn,ChosenBrad1322,37,Mon Jul 20 16:13:26 2015 UTC,"Most people would apply Rule 25-2, the rule that covers embedded balls.  This would be a mistake because 25-2 does not apply in this case.  25-2 only applies to balls embedded ""through the green"".  The definition of ""through the green"" does not include the tee or the green of the hole you are playing and does not include any hazards.  Rule 16-1c is what allows you to repair the ball mark, even though your ball is embedded in it.  You don't even have to mark the ball under 16-1; if the ball moves during the repair, you simply have to replace the ball.  There is no penalty for the ball moving.  If the ball has moved during the repair under rule 16-1, it must be replaced and rule 20-3 applies.  Specifically, 20-3b would apply.  20-3b is used when the lie of the ball to be replaced has been altered.  This rule says the ball must be placed in the lie most similar to the original lie within one club length of the hole. On the green, that basically means on top of the repaired ball mark.  In your case, the ball will not remain at rest in this spot.  In this case 20-3d applies.  The ball must be replaced on the spot nearest the original spot and not nearer the hole where the ball will stay at rest.  This spot must not be in a hazard.  If the ball is replaced, comes to rest, then subsequently moves (rolls down the hill in your case) the ball must be played as it lies.

golf,3dykjn,DrunkenGolfer,5,Tue Jul 21 03:46:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks. So in simple terms, I find the spot on the green no closer to the hole where the ball will rest if I'm reading what u said correctly."
golf,3dykjn,golfrinserepeat,4,Mon Jul 20 17:03:35 2015 UTC,"Basically, yes.  Unless it won't stay there, then you have to put it as close as possible, but not nearer the hole, wherever it will stay.  That may be off the green."
golf,3dykjn,retlab,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:40:01 2015 UTC,"If the ball is replaced, comes to rest, then subsequently moves (rolls down the hill in your case) the ball must be played as it lies.   I've had to use this very rule a number of times recently, for when a dropped ball won't stay on a hillside and rolls (typically) into a bunker. We had a lot of rain and were instructed to play lift, clean, and replace everywhere. You'll run into this a lot under those conditions, or when a ball is plugged into the grass by a bunker."
golf,3dykjn,golfrinserepeat,2,Mon Jul 20 19:37:20 2015 UTC,"IIRC for drops it's a little different. If you drop a ball and it rolls into a hazard, you can place the ball."
golf,3dykjn,out_of_time,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:57:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't word that very well. Yes, it's the same principle as when you drop the ball and it rolls into a hazard or too far from where you are allowed to drop it. On the lift, clean, and replace thing it was pretty common to find a ball sorta embedded in the ground surrounding a bunker, and when you unplugged it, cleaned it, and tried to place it where it was it would roll down the hill into the bunker, so you got to move it to some grass nearby that was a bit more level, no closer to the hole."
golf,3dykjn,BRock11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:42:46 2015 UTC,"I think you have to deal with a very tough chip. The embedded ball rule states that your ball cannot move closer to the pin, but it says nothing about it moving further away.   I'd ask the course pro though, there may be some local rules in play as well."
golf,3dykjn,out_of_time,0,Mon Jul 20 16:39:48 2015 UTC,So he's supposed to take up a chunk of the green? Somehow I doubt that.

golf,3dykjn,MizzouRah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:37:27 2015 UTC,"Nope.  If it rolls, he has to replace it at the nearest point no nearer the hole where it will come to rest.  Once it is at rest, if it starts to roll, he has to ""deal with the roll""."
golf,3dykjn,MizzouRah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:43:57 2015 UTC,"Putt from where the ball comes to rest after placing it. The ball is in play as soon as it is placed.  From: http://theaposition.com/jamesamcafee/golf/243/be-careful-if-ball-moves-on-green  ""However, if he marks the ball, then the presumption inherent in the rules that the act of addressing the ball caused it to move is no longer valid. If it moves after the ball has been replaced and he has not taken his stance, there is no penalty and he putts from the ball’s new position.  Does that mean if it rolls into the cup that you have holed out with the previous stroke? Yes!  Of course, the ball could also roll farther from the hole, or even out of bounds or into a hazard if it was on a slope near those white stakes or near red or yellow stakes indicating a hazard.  One  other thing to remember is not to replace the ball if it happens to move even if your marker is still on the green."""

Such is the fickle game that is golf my friend.  What if he didnt hit THE MOST putts in a major round like he did Friday (37) What if he makes the down hill for par on 17, sorry kid is a class act and I rooted for him... But to say it was all the fault at 8... seemed to fire him up to birdie 3 of the next 4... you can't say that, MANY THINGS made him lose this weekend, same as DJ at Chambers Bay... He hit E after the first day and lost...Had nothing to do with leaking a putt on the 72nd.. If he hits -1 over Fri-Sun he wins...

golf,3dxput,stephenjr311,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:50:48 2015 UTC,"finding the ball would have meant he could take an unplayable lie and a one stroke penalty, therefore playing his 3rd shot either two club lengths away no closer to the hole or as far back on line with the hole as he would like. Not finding the  ball meant he had to take a lost ball, meaning he had to take a stroke penalty and play his then third shot from where he hit is last shot (the tee box). So, third shot from next or behind that bush is a much better situation than third shot from the tee box, which is why he so desperately wanted to find it.   that make sense?"
golf,3dxput,fkfyfk,2,Mon Jul 20 14:56:25 2015 UTC,"Yes that does.  They said on the broadcast that it was a 2 shot penalty vs. 1 shot penalty, but based on what you explained, they are both ""technically"" 1 shot penalties, it's just in the difference between having to go back to hit the original shot will take an extra stroke to get somewhere close to where the unplayable drop would have been."

Duval has worked SO hard to come back from the top - though even as the #1 golfer, Duval was never in Tiger's territory (nobody but Jack really ever was), it's still as close to a proxy as Tiger will get. So many people offering advice - including this entire sub - have NO idea what he's going through. Duval does...and just not only made the cut but shot a 66 in the third round. I think he could help, AND I think he's the kind of guy who would be happy to help."
golf,3dvzez,greebytime,3,Mon Jul 20 02:31:10 2015 UTC,I think who Tiger could really use some advice from is Andre Agassi. Another prodigy turned superstar/celebrity athlete who went through a TERRIBLE slump. Agassi like Tiger had a HUGE spotlight on him because he had to live up to the rock star celebrity image. Nobody else on the PGA tour can relate to the expectations Tiger deals with.
golf,3dvzez,Kirbybajerby,0,Mon Jul 20 11:39:16 2015 UTC,Umm I don't think Tiger needs advice from Duval.  In fact I don't think Duval is even in the top 1000 in world ranking.  His rapid decline will be trumped by woods if he doesn't turn it around.  I'll be honest though.  The field is a lot tougher than it was back when Tiger dominated.  That's a different thread though.
golf,3dvzez,Magnum_44,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:15:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I think this is more of a psych thing, he has the saddest face 24/7. He should probably just chill and accept what's happening and then hopefully gradually improve closer to where he was. Maybe get an unsexy therapist..."
golf,3dvzez,91Jacob,2,Mon Jul 20 13:12:24 2015 UTC,Tiger has dealt with so many injures plus him aging I don't believe this would really help. I don't think it would be possible for him to swing the same as he used to because of the damage it would do his body. Given what he's doing now really isn't working either though.
golf,3dvzez,jbates0223,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:40:56 2015 UTC,"This is true, and for all the ""he changed his swing four times!"" it's important to acknowledge that some of that is because of the stress it put on his body, the toll it took (four knee surgeries, I believe, plus other stuff)...he can't play the same way anymore but he's obviously talented enough to develop a new way to win. He's smart enough that he could play more target golf than trying to bomb next to DJ and Bubba, but so far it doesn't appear he wants to make that kind of a change."
golf,3dvzez,greebytime,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:00:37 2015 UTC,Anybody who has dealt with back problems can empathize with and understanding clearly why Tiger continues to struggle on the course. Back injuries and the pain that comes with it take so much out of you. I admire him for fighting through the pain and trying to play.

golf,3dywbs,Miggaletoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:37:41 2015 UTC,"But all Open courses are links courses? Moreover, the USGA is trying to instill a risk-reward aspect in many of their new designs – mainly via having tees which can vary by even hundreds of yards. All of these features are encapsulated by courses such as St Andrews."

golf,3dze9e,jerseyknit,3,Mon Jul 20 19:41:48 2015 UTC,If your asking what clubs to upgrade you need to chart your game first. Whats a typical round for you? Are you missing fws? greens? There is nothing inherently wrong with your equipment if you score well. So how many fws out of 14 do you hit per round? how many greens out of 18 do you hit per round?
golf,3dze9e,mstrymxer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:49:20 2015 UTC,"I don't score very well, which is kinda the point of the question.  How much of my play is a result of my equipment holding me back?  I feel that my swing is pretty solid, but that my execution is lacking.  Also, I'm curious to know if having ""matching"" clubs matters.  My driver is incredibly light compared to my irons, and my wedges are weighted differently than my irons, etc..."
golf,3dze9e,tripsssi,2,Mon Jul 20 20:19:11 2015 UTC,Properly fitted equipment is what you should be looking into.
golf,3dze9e,aithosrds,2,Mon Jul 20 20:27:38 2015 UTC,"This.  You need a set that is properly suited to your swing and you can't do that if you don't get fitted.  That doesn't necessarily mean you need new clubs though, you can go get a fitting done and take those results and use them to buy used clubs if you want.    You'll end up paying for the fitting (should be around $100) since normally they are only free with a purchase, but it's well worth it once you have a consistent swing.  Just make sure the fitting includes hitting your current set, prospective clubs (and not just a single club) on a launch monitor with a certified pro fitter and not just wrist to floor and a lie board.  Wrist to floor and lie board is the starting point for a fitting, not a complete fitting.  As to the rest: equipment makes a difference but at the end of the day your swing is what determines what the ball does.  The club type/quality can only do so much, it if much more important to have a well fitting club than a certain type of club.  Also, having mismatched clubs is generally a bad idea.  It's fine to have a set of woods be different than a set of irons/wedges, but if you're mixing and matching you need to be REALLY conscious of what your lofts/lies/lengths are.  Club makers don't have a standard they adhere to, so a 5i from one company might be the same loft as a 4 iron from another, etc.  What you want from a golf set is consistency, you want to have even gaps between each club so that no matter what distance you are from the flag you have an easy choice what to hit.  If you have mix and match clubs it is highly likely you have clubs that serve the same purpose or gaps where you have no good club to hit, that's bad."
golf,3dze9e,Levesque77,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:24:15 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks that's very helpful.  As most of us, especially someone like me who isn't scoring too low, are constantly tinkering with our swing, is it possible to change swing too much and need different clubs?"
golf,3dze9e,aithosrds,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:15:15 2015 UTC,"Yes. That's why he mentioned ""once you have a consistent swing"""
golf,3dze9e,Levesque77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:25:06 2015 UTC,"Actually, I would say that generally the answer is no.  When most people tinker with their swing it feels like they are making big changes when the reality is they are barely changing at all.  It takes very little to make something feel really awkward and mentally you equate that to: big change.    The reason I said ""once you have a consistent swing"" is because prior to having a reliable swing it doesn't do you any good to get fitted.  If you go to get a fitting done and you still shank, top, duff and hack the ball around you have zero consistency and the fitter won't be able to accurately fit you.  The point of a fitting is to make sure you get a set that has the proper length, lie, loft, offset, shaft flex, etc.  If your swing is all over the place then your fitting results will be entirely dependent on how you swing that day.  Have a good day or a bad day and you'll get wildly different results and that undermines the value of a fitting.  With that being said: it doesn't take long to establish basic consistency.  A lot of people think consistency means a repeatable golf shot and that isn't necessarily true.  Consistency just means that you swing generally on the same path and that you strike mostly the same part of the club-face.  It doesn't mean that the ball goes the same direction every shot, that's related to face angle and swing path and has little to do with what part of the club-face you actually strike.  A fitting is to get you hitting the ball on the center of the club-face, it isn't meant to fix your slice.  Only a swing path change will do that..."
golf,3dze9e,aithosrds,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:38:23 2015 UTC,"I think there may have been a misunderstanding. I wasn't referring to changing it after you have one. I was trying to say the same thing you are, but now that I re-read the comments, that wasn't clear at all on my part."
golf,3dze9e,mstrymxer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:42:54 2015 UTC,"I know what you meant, it's just that I think he's asking a different question and might misunderstand your answer.  It sounds like he's asking: ""once I've developed a swing is it possible to tinker enough to need to be re-fitted"" and the answer is usually no.    People develop their natural swing really fast and very little changes from that point, I just want to make sure he understands that.  Once you've golfed 5-10 rounds whether you're hitting the ball well or not you've probably already got your basic swing and most of the rest is just refining it.    A couple lessons is enough once you've got the basic fundamentals to go get fitted, and unless you drastically change your swing there is no reason you should need to be re-fitted if it was done properly."
golf,3dze9e,mstrymxer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:06 2015 UTC,"you are correct.  I have been playing long enough and often enough to be fairly sure that I have a ""consistent"" swing, despite the fact that I still change things.  Most of the changes have been minor, such as take away speed and wrist angle at the top of the swing.  I feel much more confident now in the thought of actually going for a club fitting."

I don't have any fairway woods, I have a 2H, a 3I, and a 4I and I can't hit a single one decent.  On par 5's I pretty much resign myself to Driver, 5 I, and usually 9I or Wedge.  I am giving up distance over accuracy but I worry I am depriving myself of scoring opportunities if I could find a fairway wood I can hit well."

I like the way they look at address, and they are also a little more lofted than some of the other hybrids out there (my 3 is 21 degrees).  I'm not much on ""thinner"" hybrids, and much prefer them to have a more robust head, more like a wood than an iron.  Here's an example of what I'm talking about. The club on the left just feels better to me, many of the hybrids I've seen look more like the club on the left."
golf,3dzc61,thesneakywalrus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:10:24 2015 UTC,"Two things, first, get a lesson or two, I think you are trying to make one swing fit every club, but there are small changes you should be making with every club (mainly feet and ball position). I've had the same issue, and a lot had to do with small things causing to great of an attack angle on long irons.   Second, it sounds like you are deep in your head about this, go to the range or a practice round, and hit silly shots with these clubs, shots that you don't plan on hitting from where it lands. Try and get the negative expectations out of your head by hitting shots that really have no expectation. My personal favorite is to hit balls into a water hazard."
