SpecArt,3d58xk,neonoodle,2,Tue Jul 14 01:35:48 2015 UTC,"Heh, heh. Silly stick salesman doesn't know the stick market crashed years ago."
SpecArt,3d58xk,DocCalculus,2,Tue Jul 14 05:00:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the stick market hasn't been the same since potential customers discovered sticks grow on trees."
SpecArt,3d58xk,neonoodle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:35:27 2015 UTC,I really like the highly technological mixed with a primitive looking species.
SpecArt,3cshq3,ethan_kahn,8,Fri Jul 10 12:23:36 2015 UTC,Witcher...I was hoping you'd come.
SpecArt,3cshq3,MafiaPenguin007,13,Fri Jul 10 18:00:04 2015 UTC,"Cool piece, but the horns really remove any recognition that it's Vader if you ask me.  Took me a while to even see the shape of the helmet was the same past all the differences."
SpecArt,3cshq3,dslyecix,5,Fri Jul 10 13:13:22 2015 UTC,Helm kinda reminds me of nicol Bolas.
SpecArt,3cshq3,Rio_Bravo,4,Fri Jul 10 14:06:01 2015 UTC,"Reminded me about the generals from The Wild Hunt in The Witcher, especially Imlerith (to the left)"
SpecArt,3cshq3,BuiltTheSkyForMyDawn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:09:07 2015 UTC,I was thinking this guy
SpecArt,3cshq3,RonnieDobbs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:11:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I thought, though I think it looks a bit more like Eredin if only for the skully face and the horns. But I do see how the bottom of the mask looks more like Imlerith's."
SpecArt,3cshq3,MrBaz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:40:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah face/helm is def more like Eredin, but the armour looks so much like the one Imlerith is donning."
SpecArt,3cshq3,BuiltTheSkyForMyDawn,3,Sat Jul 11 12:32:22 2015 UTC,"There's been a lot of alternate history star wars art lately.  Where's it coming from?  Is it all fan-generated, or is this sponsored somehow?"

SpecArt,3cdpdx,Infinite_Monkee,17,Tue Jul 7 02:46:27 2015 UTC,Why is her vagina sharp?
SpecArt,3cdpdx,8_Bit_Armada,2,Tue Jul 7 11:56:49 2015 UTC,wearing a cup?
SpecArt,3cdpdx,nDREqc,3,Tue Jul 7 17:15:17 2015 UTC,A sharp one?
SpecArt,3cdpdx,8_Bit_Armada,3,Tue Jul 7 17:48:48 2015 UTC,I don't know... I tried...
SpecArt,3cdpdx,nDREqc,0,Tue Jul 7 18:58:55 2015 UTC,It's fantastic art. The vagine was the only thing that threw me off.
SpecArt,3cdpdx,8_Bit_Armada,9,Tue Jul 7 19:35:18 2015 UTC,"This is pretty cool but she looks way too young. Not a big fan of the hairstyle either, its like a punk teen version of samus"
SpecArt,3cdpdx,HumbleManatee,3,Tue Jul 7 06:53:25 2015 UTC,"she's also supposed to be blond.  i kinda like it personally, but it doesnt fit her very well imo."
SpecArt,3cdpdx,SexualPie,3,Tue Jul 7 11:00:04 2015 UTC,Green is her original hair color
SpecArt,3cdpdx,max_vette,2,Tue Jul 7 13:18:17 2015 UTC,Yeah but she still isnt supposed to look like a 14 year old girl
SpecArt,3cdpdx,HumbleManatee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:11:50 2015 UTC,no argument there
SpecArt,3cdpdx,max_vette,5,Tue Jul 7 22:52:51 2015 UTC,"the face, it's young"
SpecArt,3cdpdx,dr_rentschler,5,Tue Jul 7 10:38:56 2015 UTC,It's ok. One of the awesome things about Samus is that you don't necessarily know she's a chick and she's definitely not sexualized.
SpecArt,3cdpdx,destructormuffin,9,Tue Jul 7 15:07:41 2015 UTC,"It's a gun arm, not a gun attached to an arm."
SpecArt,3cdpdx,skyskr4per,8,Tue Jul 7 03:32:45 2015 UTC,She doesn't have the full varia suit on so let's just imagine she got ambushed while suiting up and grabbed the nearest weapon she could get her hands on.
SpecArt,3cdpdx,reepha,5,Tue Jul 7 06:13:39 2015 UTC,well there's a few more inaccuracies than just that...
SpecArt,3cdpdx,SexualPie,0,Tue Jul 7 10:59:39 2015 UTC,"Imagine if game developers could make a dark, gritty, bleak new game for either xbox or Playstation. Sigh... one can dream, right?"
SpecArt,3cdpdx,intergalactic512,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:41:20 2015 UTC,I can tell you have never played metroid prime 2. Also metroid is pretty freaking dark when you think about it
SpecArt,3cdpdx,HumbleManatee,-1,Tue Jul 7 21:12:34 2015 UTC,"Terrible. Draw your own characters, stop ruining icons for attention."
SpecArt,3cdpdx,johnathanstrangescat,-6,Tue Jul 7 15:36:53 2015 UTC,Is...is she peeing??

SpecArt,3c0lg5,thomar,2,Fri Jul 3 17:54:47 2015 UTC,It looks like a Starcraft Zerg ground defense tower.
SpecArt,3c0lg5,Absolutionis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:53:41 2015 UTC,exactly what I was thinking. This is what happens when proxy hatches go down.

SpecArt,3br1t8,EstusFiend,3,Wed Jul 1 22:32:25 2015 UTC,"Wow, nicely done. Very creepy.   4 right arms, 2 left.  7 wings on each side. Why?"
