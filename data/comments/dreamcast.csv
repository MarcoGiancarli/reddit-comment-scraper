I'm pretty sure from there you can use any burning software to copy that to a disc. It's been a long time since I've had to mess with this stuff, but I'm sure there are tutorials on youtube."

dreamcast,3dp0td,Arsonlent,-2,Wed Jul 22 12:15:39 2015 UTC,"Here's to hoping Sony will throw some  additional cash to buy the other goals as ""PS4 exclusive content"" - after all, they do buy ""extra hours of gameplay"" for titles such as Assassin's Creed… I'd be okay with that.  Unlikely, though."
dreamcast,3dp0td,MairusuPawa,8,Sat Jul 18 09:43:53 2015 UTC,Why do you want content to be locked to one system? That just seems ridiculous.
dreamcast,3dp0td,Nomnom_downvotes,3,Sat Jul 18 12:43:41 2015 UTC,"This is already happening in the industry. I'd much rather see Shenmue 3 being fully completed this way (all stretch goals) if that's obtainable, than having no option at all. And that would benefit the PC version too, since they'll share a common code base."
dreamcast,3dp0td,MairusuPawa,4,Sat Jul 18 12:58:41 2015 UTC,"I know it happens and i hate it. There should be no exclusive content, all that comes of that is dick measuring contests from people who need to justify their system choice while the publisher roll around in money. It sucks."
dreamcast,3dp0td,Nomnom_downvotes,-1,Sat Jul 18 13:06:18 2015 UTC,"People care about that? I don't think they really do, only publishers brag about it (they need marketing material). This is pretty much the only shot publishers have at differentiating their platform nowadays, considering how similar consoles are (and how similar to PC they are)."
dreamcast,3dp0td,MairusuPawa,3,Sat Jul 18 13:53:29 2015 UTC,I know what you're saying but people definitely do brag about it. It's one of the reasons i cannot stand browsing current gen subreddits apart from the Ninty stuff.

dreamcast,3dijp3,PM_YOUR_TACO_RECIPE,7,Thu Jul 16 15:37:41 2015 UTC,"I will get downvotes for this, but here's my deal:   Make a game I will buy it   I'm not one for paying up front for a game that may or may not see the light of day.  Nor am I up for overpaying on it to try and get more features crammed in."
dreamcast,3dijp3,DerekStu,16,Thu Jul 16 16:51:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't blame anyone for being skeptical of crowdfunding as a whole, and you certainly shouldn't be downvoted for expressing an opinion.   That said, Shenmue falls into a very unusual niche in gaming. It's a complex, open-world game that requires a tremendous investment in code and art assets, but it will probably sell fewer than a million copies. At $49.99 or whatever on GameStop's shelves, the game is simply a losing proposition, and would never get financed.   Kickstarter is amazing in situations like this, because it gives someone like Yu Suzuki a platform to ask the hardcore fans, ""is this game worth more than the usual sticker price to you?"" For thousands of true believers, the answer is yes, finishing Shenmue is worth more than the average price of admission.   If Shenmue 3 isn't worth the extra money to you... that's fine! You'll still get to play and enjoy it someday because others were willing to dig a little deeper to make it happen. What I take issue with is the suggestion that people who are passionate about this title are being foolish, which is how your post reads."
dreamcast,3dijp3,penguinn,3,Thu Jul 16 18:32:06 2015 UTC,"Or... the game goes massively over budget, and either never gets released, or gets released in a state that is far more limited than what is promised.  That's what he's saying.  This happens often in crowdfunded anythings."
dreamcast,3dijp3,lilmul123,6,Thu Jul 16 20:13:00 2015 UTC,"If you know you'll buy it anyway, it basically comes down to who you want to have your money. Do you want Sony, Big Box Retailer and Ys Net to split your dollar on a game that's already completed and thus can't be improved by your funds OR do you want Ys Net to get 100% of your money purely for development and fulfillment of backer rewards (minus KS fees) thus improving the final product with your funds and giving nothing to Sony and Big Box Retailer.  Of course, if you're not sure you even want to buy it, that's a different story. I'm not bashing your decision not to pledge, just trying to put it into a different perspective for you."
dreamcast,3dijp3,anh86,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:25:35 2015 UTC,Oh I am most definitely buying it!
dreamcast,3dijp3,DerekStu,3,Thu Jul 16 19:29:01 2015 UTC,"If you're a big fan, you've got to back the project. Better to have your money go to make the game better forever than to boost a big box retailer's bottom line!"
dreamcast,3dijp3,anh86,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:43:43 2015 UTC,I buy all my games digitally.  I shan't back this project.

dreamcast,3dijp3,morphinapg,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:29:29 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't get downvotes, that's pretty fair. Kickstarting is still a gamble but some projects (like this one) wouldn't have been funded otherwise. I'm not worried about losing my money on this title as I would be for an indie game with big promises and no track record."
dreamcast,3dijp3,penguinn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:17:13 2015 UTC,"This project is no longer a gamble. It's coming. Ever since reaching the $2M level, they have to make it. So there's no gamble in supporting them now. It's just that the more people support the game now, the better game we get."
dreamcast,3dijp3,morphinapg,2,Thu Jul 16 18:19:41 2015 UTC,"While I am a backer, and I generally support what you're saying, I think it's important to stress that Kickstarter's ""accountability"" is very flimsy. I've backed three or four different projects on Kickstarter that have ended with the project cancelled without refunds or people not getting their backer rewards.   Kickstarter itself warns you when backing a project:   Kickstarter does not guarantee projects or investigate a creator's ability to complete their project. It is the responsibility of the project creator to complete their project as promised, and the claims of this project are theirs alone.   While I have faith in Shenmue 3 -- again, I am a backer, and I've pledged three figures -- a project being funded in no way guarantees it will be completed."
dreamcast,3dijp3,penguinn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:38:50 2015 UTC,They also say this:  Kickstarter's Terms of Use require creators to fulfill all rewards of their project or refund any backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill.
dreamcast,3dijp3,morphinapg,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:33:57 2015 UTC,"Which, again, is no guarantee that the project will be completed. The most Kickstarter can do is refuse to allow people to run another Kickstarter, which is completely toothless. Someone has already linked to a dozen examples of failed Kickstarters, and I could link you to dozens more.   Kickstarter saying you're not allowed to abandon a project doesn't stop it from happening."
dreamcast,3dijp3,penguinn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:10:48 2015 UTC,"No, it means they would force the creators of the kickstarter to refund your money, which means there is no risk."
dreamcast,3dijp3,morphinapg,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:32:31 2015 UTC,"Kickstarter explicitly states in their terms of use that they do not hold backer's funds and will not issue refunds on a creator's behalf, ever.   Kickstarter doesn’t offer refunds. Responsibility for finishing a project lies entirely with the project creator. Kickstarter doesn’t hold funds on creators’ behalf, cannot guarantee creators’ work, and does not offer refunds.   Kickstarter has absolutely no mechanism whatsoever to force a creator to issue a refund, as evidenced by the dozens and dozens of failed projects where backers got completely shafted. Why do you think the FTC and State Attorneys General are having to get involved on behalf of backers?   You obviously have your mind made up on this despite all facts to the contrary, so you'll probably have to learn the hard way."
dreamcast,3dijp3,BangkokPadang,-1,Thu Jul 16 23:39:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, Kickstarter won't do it for them, but as the page explains, the creators of the project are legally obligated to deliver on the project or refund the backers. If they do not do so, a lawsuit could be used to force them to do so.  If they don't deliver or refund the backers, they are breaking a legal contract they made."
dreamcast,3dijp3,morphinapg,2,Thu Jul 16 23:49:00 2015 UTC,"People break legal contracts all the time.  It has been hilarious to watch your argument degrade from ""No, it means they would force the creators of the kickstarter to refund your money, which means there is no risk."" to ""Yes, Kickstarter won't do it for them... a lawsuit could be used to force them to do so. If they don't deliver or refund the backers, they are breaking a legal contract they made.""  ""There is no risk"" and 'you might have to sue them' are at complete opposite ends of the spectrum.  Kickstarter is risky. It is notoriously risky, and there have been plenty of people who, for example, were promised genre-redefining RPGs that got buggy, simple, 4 hour long quests that were made with RPG Maker X and it's default art assets.  Any argument that Kickstarter is without risk is naive and ignorant of reality.  With all that said, though, I still think IT IS ABSOLUTELY WORTH THAT RISK FOR EVEN A CHANCE TO GET SHENMUE 3"
dreamcast,3dijp3,DerekStu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:59:23 2015 UTC,"The game is already funded, which means it is coming. No maybe, is. So if you give them $29 you get a digital copy of the game. That will likely be cheaper than actually waiting and buying the game yourself. Or you can donate $60 and get a nice looking physical copy."
dreamcast,3dijp3,morphinapg,2,Thu Jul 16 18:18:11 2015 UTC,"That's my point, the fact it is funded does not guarantee it will come into existence.  It could be years.  Wake me when it's out and I'll gladly buy it."
dreamcast,3dijp3,lilmul123,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:19:55 2015 UTC,"Actually yes it does guarantee that. They are required to deliver what they promise. The thing is, the more people donate now, the better game we get. So we need those donations I'd we want a better game to come out. If everyone just waited the game would never have happened."
dreamcast,3dijp3,morphinapg,2,Thu Jul 16 18:20:46 2015 UTC,"No, they are not required to deliver.  Straight from the horse's mouth: ""It is the responsibility of the project creator to fulfill the promises of their project. Kickstarter reviews projects to ensure they do not violate our rules, however Kickstarter does not investigate a creator's ability to complete their project.""  Essentially, Kickstarter provides the interface and the architecture to provide crowdfunding to a project, but they do not care how the project progresses, or whether or not a product ever even gets released."
