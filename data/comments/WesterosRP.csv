WesterosRP,3e1rp9,TheRedTurnip,2,Tue Jul 21 08:05:27 2015 UTC,"The sound of voices talking made Minaya sigh with displeasure. Normally, she looked forward to giving her ears a chance to decipher what strangers were saying. But recently, voices approaching only meant that it would be more temple workers, coming to nag at her or to nitpick her cleaning.   Volantis was a city of bustle and excitement. Only, Minaya rarely had the chance to leave the temple. She was a slave, bound to the orders of her masters, the Red Priests. And while there were other slaves, they were usually not given as many cleaning duties as her.   ""Black blood,"" was the name that they spat at her, upon learning she was born Asshai. And it was not only the masters, but the other slaves, too. They never let her eat or go out with them on missions, and she was given the bed in the corner.  Minaya didn't mind though. The Lord gave her the only warmth she needed. Even if she was not allowed to go near the fire as her ""blood may put the light out"".   Scrubbing the floor with more vigor, she noticed the men were speaking the common tongue and she became curious. Less concentration was on to brushing the stones and more onto what the men were saying."

Are you afraid all the other priests will hear me calling you by your pet name?"" inquired Alequo, stopping in the middle of the hall, poking at Oros' nose. ""It's not like anybody in this blasted temple speaks common."" said Alequo mid-chuckle. ""Are you sure, Alequo? ""There are spies everywhere, everyone is out to embarrass everyone. I swear, the amount of gossips we have around here is ridiculous."" muttered Oros, taking a quick peek over at the servant girl  as she polished the floors. Sometimes he wondered about the temple workers, how they were, who they were, why they were."
WesterosRP,3e1rp9,LotusDog,2,Tue Jul 21 09:08:58 2015 UTC,"Minaya ducked the brush back into the bucket, seeing how they assumed that no one could understand. It filled her with pride to already know so many different, but she did not want to let pride get in the way of her work, lest the masters punish her for sloppy service. Rather she moved to the muddy tracks they left, saying, ""Excuse me, sers."""
WesterosRP,3e1rp9,LotusDog,2,Tue Jul 21 09:41:00 2015 UTC,"Surprised at the girl's sudden movement Oros was jumped back out of her way and frowned, noticing the mess they'd made. ""Oh! We've made quite the mess, my apologies."" walking over and pulling a faded red rag from his belt and crouching down on the floor, beginning to scrub. ""So tell me, how does a maid learn common?"" inquired the priest, face glued to his work. Meanwhile Alequo stared almost in shock, intrigued by the young lady."
WesterosRP,3e1rp9,LotusDog,3,Tue Jul 21 09:54:00 2015 UTC,"Nonchalantly, she shrugged, keeping her face neutral. ""I just listen and learn. My Valyrian is much stronger."" She wanted to bring up the language she knew best, but knew that would only strike fear into their hearts.   ""But practice is good,"" she explained, keeping to the common tongue. ""You are both from Essos. I can tell."" The brush swirled against the stones, and she looked up at the men. The old man gaped at her and Minaya looked back, peering over at him."
WesterosRP,3e1rp9,LotusDog,3,Tue Jul 21 10:14:10 2015 UTC,"Oros followed suit and turned to the gaping Alequo. ""Er, are you all right Alequo? You're not usually dazzled by every servant girl you meet."" alaerted to his own bizarre behaviour, Alequo clamped his mouth shut and straightened himself up. ""I'm fine, thank you. Tell me girl, where are you from?"" the old man had a kind look to him, smiling  weakly, all his teeth in fine shape. Odd, considering his age."

I can only hope to continue his mantle.""   Edwyn sought to change the tone to a more jovial tune. ""I hope to make your trip worthwhile during your stay,"" he spoke, with an excitement to his voice. ""While your feast will not be ready until tonight, perhaps we should retreat to my solar. I have been looking forward to hearing the story of your victory and your travels.""  Edwyn hoped his manners were on point. Memories of guests in the Eyrie were blurry at best, and in this regard he found it difficult to emulate his father. Here, he would have to build his own path."

Ethan shifted in his seat, and took a sup of wine, ""I'm impressed by your hospitality if truth be told, it must be a pain to haul anything up here, especially in bad weather."" Ethan paused, and sipped his wine once more, thinking back on the battle that had freed his house ""The fight wasn't easy, we lost alot of good men, good knights, but we broke them hard, it'll take them a very long time, if they ever do, to recover"".

However if there was one thing that Dontos did understand it was politics and the need to keep a good relation to your liege Lord or have him forever resent you and since he doubted very much that his father would send any kind of comforting words to the Trout he knew that the responsibility would fall on his shoulders.  As he calmly made his way up to the short stair way to Lord Tullys chambers making sure to move slowly so as to not flair up the pain in his braced leg, he could hear the distinct sound of singing, not a common sound in the red keep and certainly not one he would have suspected to come from Lord Tullys chamber Mayhaps, the Lord has hired a bard to preform for him, though the Bear and the Maiden Fair is a queer choice of song outside of a tavern   However as he grew closer it became clear that Tully had not hired a bard and that the song was uttered from his own lips a strange talent for a Lord Paramount  ""My Lord"" Dontos knocked once on the door, trying to conceal his sniggers as the Lord continued to sing reaching the end of the song now.  ""My Lord!"" It appeared the fool couldn't hear him over the sound of his own singing, he sighed, it would be a shame to interrupt but he was on a schedule.  He opened the door."

For a second he did not know the man but soon remembered that feast many years ago in Riverrun, Jorah put the lute down on the stone window sill.  ""Why Hello there Lord Dontos Bracken, I haven't seen you in many years, what do I owe to this sudden visit.""  Jorah filled up a cup with some red wine offering some to Dontos, Felton continues to drink in the corner not saying a word."
WesterosRP,3e130t,BlackwoodSlayer,2,Tue Jul 21 14:03:57 2015 UTC,"Dontos bowed slightly, accepting the wine with his left hand, taking a small sip before placing it carefully on one of the chambers ornately carved oaken wood table making sure not to spill any onto the pristine carpet he offered his right hand to the Lord of Riverrun looking him up and down before he began to speak.  “Lord Tully, it is a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance… Officialy, however I am no Lord, that would be my father Lord Mern, he rules Stone Hedge, which I am slightly surprised you do not know” He made sure to note Jorah’s reaction to this, he wanted to try to understand what kind of man the Tully was “I have come to offer my condolences for the terrible events at Riverrun I am sure you lost some dear friends, my father would hae sent a letter himself however I am sure he is busy with other affairs” He paused for a second contemplating whether to mention it “I heard your singing in here earlier, the Bear and the Maiden Fair is not a song I oft hear outside of a Tavern”"

""Well your father may be the Lord of Stone Hedge but you are Master of Coin making you a Lord in your own way. I understand, many of my vassals are busy men but you coming here shows your Houses loyalty.""  Jorah takes another sip of his wine licking his lips after.

Family is important, I would sing some of the songs my father taught me but I fear they’d be too vulgar for your taste and shine a shall we say, less than favourable light on a fellow council member of mine” He noted the Lord’s fondness of wine and the quantity in which he consumed it, he also made a mental note to order more of that particular vintage as it may prove of use in the future.  “I appreciate your sentiment but I share very few of the responsibilities of a real lord, my position is rather dull compared to the lavish life I am sure you lead, I am but a money counter not a Lord” Dontos was interested to hear that the Tully had spent considerable time in Essosi taverns, wondering what a man of his status had done so far from home."

A few heated words were exchanged between the guard and Jaehaerys. They rotated inside the large doors, locking them from the inside. They were intricate, though necessary.     ""Search him. Top to bottom. I trust you wouldn't bring weapons to speak with me, but one is never too careful."" Jaehaerys smirked at the dark haired rider, full of vigor.     As they searched him, Jaehaerys spoke. ""Now, Emmon, to what do I owe the pleasure? I assume, it is concerning Asher Storm. State your business, and then you may lea-. Ah, Emmon, what are those?""

They have shared my bed more nights than any maiden I've ever fucked.""  The prince regarded him coolly, his one eye full of malice.  Emmon had seen this before. This was the look of a man whose mind had left him, but wits remained. He'd killed several such men, and been paid well. But this was no contract, no employment. He was in the house of a madman, trying to keep the madness from turning to bloodshed. And his greatest weapon was cooped up in a giant cage a quarter mile away.  ""I visited young Asher Storm in his new quarters,"" he said, doing his best to sound casual. ""I'm told he's suspected of offending your lady wife's virtue.

He took one more gulp before leaving his guest chambers to investigate. He heard shouting, though he couldn't make it out.   He ran down the corridor towards the source of the noise, torches flickering in the breeze he caused. By the time he reached Asher's room, it was too late. The door was wide open, candles still lit, but the bed was empty. A table and chair had been thrown over in what looked to have been a struggle.   Oh Gods He knew where the Storm boy was.  Emmon arrived at the dungeons to be met by a scarred old gaoler.  ""The fuck you want?"" the jailkeep asked.  ""I believe you have a fresh prisoner,"" Emmon replied coolly. ""I should like to speak with him.  The gaoler considered him with a lazy eye and gripped his cudgel. Emmon's hand rested on the handle of his dirk.  ""None's to see 'im,"" the ugly old fuck barked. ""Prince's orders.""  ""Ah yes, Prince Jaehaerys,"" Emmon said pleasantly. ""A man must obey his prince, especially when that prince has a dragon that could eat you whole and shit you out.""  He smiled at the gaoler.  ""Then again, I have a dragon as well. It's true I'm no prince, but I ride the big green one. Perhaps you've seen him? He's the one with teeth like longswords.""  The gaoler began to look uncertain.  ""Now, I'd never dream of doing such a thing, but I'd reckon my green could eat the prince's dragon and you in one sitting. Then he'd shit the pair of you out together.""  Now the dumb gaoler truly looked scared.  ""I suppose such an experiment would be unnecessary, however, if you opened that fucking gate and let me see the prisoner.""  The jailkeep nodded, fumbling at his keys to open the main gate of Dragonstone's dungeon.  ""Last cell on the left,"" lazy-eye told him.  Emmon plunged into the darkness. A couple torches served as the only thing to guide him past the cells. This place was dripping, the walls seemed to weep. And it stank of brine, nightsoil and foul odors Emmon could not place.

His servants told him of how she refused meals, refused the company of them. Refused the company of anyone but the young Asher Storm. Jaehaerys rummaged through her shelves, careful to not disturb any of the items there. He was looking through necklaces and rings and other jewelry when he found it. He had seen the quantity of wine she had been drinking, and he had found it.     It was a small black bottle. Even in the darkness, he knew what it was. What it was that she had snuck out to get. Why she had avoided him. Why she had been so distant. She was leaving him. She was to kill their child and run away. He broke down into tears, sobbing loudly.

Jaehaerys spoke, his speech broken by the tears running from the corners of his eyes. His breath caught in his throat, and he was choking on it."
WesterosRP,3dpzph,soberwolf233,4,Sun Jul 19 22:38:48 2015 UTC,"She woke up, unaware of how much time had past since she fell asleep. Seeing Jaehaerys in person, she was overcome with a mixture of emotions.   ""Jaehaerys..."" Cassella mumbled, rubbing her eyes. She saw him holding the bottle and she sighed. It was a shame she didn't just drink it already.   ""You don't love me,"" she sighed, standing up and leaning against her bedpost. ""You married me because I listened to you and I wanted to fuck you, something that not a lot of women near you do."" Her words were strung together and slurring, seeing that she was still rather woozy from all the wine.   ""Although I suppose, the great cunt of Sunspear wanted to fuck you oh so bad. You should have done it. Got her with dragonspawn, instead of me. I don't want to be a mother and I don't want to be your wife,"" she spat. ""I hate it here. If it wasn't for Asher, I would have hung myself."""
WesterosRP,3dpzph,soberwolf233,3,Sun Jul 19 22:46:47 2015 UTC,"""I will deal with the Stag."" Jaehaerys stopped. All emotion drained from his voice, and the voices danced in him.    Take her. TAKE HER NOW. The sadist within him wanted her blood to be a fountain, and other spoke up as well.     Take her to the dungeons! Make her and the Stag fuck until they both die. More and more, over and over, they yelled. They yelled until he yelled, holding the bottle in both hands.      He once more regained control of his own mind, and thus his composure. She had hit his very core with her callous comments, and Jaehaerys wasn't able to handle it.       ""I married you. I married you because I loved you. Because I saw potential to grow with you. Take your potion. Take your potion, and leave this island. You will have to find your own way from it. And your Young Stag will have to stay. My captains will not take you."" Jaehaerys turned from her, tossing the bottle onto the bed. He walked toward the door, looking back at her, tears in his eyes.     As the door shut behind him, he summoned two of his guards, and stood them on guard. They barred the door from the outside, barring any chance of exit, and stood guard in case.      The castle was his, and it was a silent mess. He would regain his life in King's Landing with Cassella gone, though he would lose the only family he had ever known.     Perhaps I was too harsh. Though she should have thought of that before she betrayed me for an imbecile."
WesterosRP,3dpzph,soberwolf233,4,Sun Jul 19 22:56:33 2015 UTC,"""NO!"" she shrieked, pounding on the door, beating it until her knuckles were splintered with wood. ""He has done nothing wrong,"" she screamed, over and over until she was sure everyone in the castle. ""Unlike you, I KEPT MY WEDDING PROMISE!"" she shouted.   Taking a moment, she prayed to the Seven and every god ever to keep Asher safe. He was a sweet boy and he had saved her life. Both from drowning and both from hurting herself. He made her laugh and he was honest.   ""Jaehaerys, please,"" she whimpered. ""I'll share a bed with you again,"" she bartered. ""Just to prove that I have not had anyone else. You can see for yourself."""
WesterosRP,3dpzph,soberwolf233,3,Sun Jul 19 23:04:15 2015 UTC,"He heard the pounding against the doors, and he ignored it. Dragonstone was a large castle, and she was of no concern.     ""I will not force you to share my bed. Take your tea and be done with this mistake of a marriage. You've wanted this since the day after I made you mine. You wanted a quick fuck, and I married you. The Stag will pay for his crimes. I don't want you in my bed. Not after that bastard has had you."" Jaehaerys was talking to a door now, nothing more.     ""I kept my promise. Erena kissed me, she asked me to protect you. You chose the protection of a boy instead of the Prince of Westeros. We are finished here."""
WesterosRP,3dpzph,soberwolf233,4,Sun Jul 19 23:09:35 2015 UTC,"""He did not have me, please! He is innocent of any crimes, you're the only man I have fucked."" she weeped. ""You're not forcing me to share your bed.""  Wiping her tears with the back of her hand, she cared not that the guards were there. ""Come here, I'll calm you down. I'll do the thing with my tongue you like so much. Please."""
WesterosRP,3do40h,That-F-Guy,2,Fri Jul 17 21:19:36 2015 UTC,"Bryden sat as his desk lamenting over a reply to a letter from the Sealord of Braavos seeking to prosper trade further along the Braavosi Coast.  A matter I should surely bring to Aemon, or at the very least the Hand. For a Blackwood he seems like a good man. The very fact he can stand to be in the same room as a Bracken marks him as one of the more sane Blackwoods.  He remembered something queer he had about the Riverlands lately. ""Was it the Mallisters that were here, or was it the Pipers? No not the Pipers. I'm sure it was the Mallisters. Tullys? No can't be Lord Tully."" He muttered to himself, his quill poised in his hand.  He stared at the letter a while longer before his face contorted in a flash of fury and he tore the letter in two and scrunched it up in his hands. Throwing it across the room he fell heavily into his chair, his mood soured by the bout of anger.  A knock at the door came sudden and unexpectedly. Bryden stood and looked quizzically at the door. He wasn't expecting anyone nor was he aware of anyone who would need him just now. He opened the door and was greeted by a haggard and tired looking man of noble birth. Auburn hair fell to around his pitted and scarred face. There was only man Bryden knew of who could meet such a description.  ""Jorah Tully. Come in."""
WesterosRP,3do40h,JoronAlt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:37:39 2015 UTC,"As the large Iron wood door swung open he saw a thin old man with a bald head and some sign of grey stubble, his hands were hidden in his cloak and his badly burned and scarred faced reminded him of himself making him feel slightly more comfortable and helped him raise a smile.  ""Hello Grand Maester Bryden, Im Lord Jorah Tully. I have never had the pleasure of meeting you but im in bloody great pain and could use your help"""
WesterosRP,3do40h,JoronAlt,2,Fri Jul 17 21:53:04 2015 UTC,"""Sit. Shirt off."" He commanded bluntly as he fetched the necessary implements. He watched as Lord Tully removed his shirt to reveal a body riddled with scars and marks, faded but powerful blows. He sat in the chair opposite Tully and first examined his hand.   No tendon damages he thought as the Lord's finger twitched.  He lay a small metal rod over the lantern on his desk and left it there paying it no heed.  He flicked the wound with the edge of a small surgical knife, Tully winced in pain and he felt the his hand tense at the unexpected stimulant. No nerve damage either.  On a closer inspection of the wound itself it was clear that it was turning necrotic, past the stage of pain and puss it was infected. He grabbed a thick moleskin from the assortment of tools he brought over and picked up the now glowing metal rod. He felt the heat emminate through the moleskin and winced for he knew the pain of burning well.  ""The dead tissue must be burned away. Best you look elsewhere."" With one deft movement he pressed the tip of the glowing rod into the wound."
WesterosRP,3do40h,JoronAlt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:07:30 2015 UTC,"Jorah Tully Smirked at the Maester's suggestion an began to speak in a cocky yet poetic tone.  ""Any Pain you feel you should see, as to understand it To Use it as your shield to gain experience for you next Challenge""  Jorah had heard his from many a man in the fighting pits of Meereen and in many Battles in the Free Cities. Those men were battle hardened like him with many scars which told many stories of battles and adventures.   Jorah stared at the Maester a second and nodded, the Maester began to push the glowing red rod onto his body, Jorah tensed up and almost screamed in pain but bit his lip until he tasted the iron in his blood. It felt like the rod was on him for days the pain was eternal but then it stopped and the rod was pulled off. Jorah signed in relief feeling blood flow down his mouth."
WesterosRP,3do40h,JoronAlt,2,Fri Jul 17 22:24:19 2015 UTC,"""Oh calm down. It's only a small burn."" He said sharply with the harsh light of the lantern making his scarred and burned face even more striking.  Necrosis. Horrible.  He reached over among the assorted tools and pulled out a small bottle of pure alcohol, an excellent solution for clearing wounds of infection. ""Try not to scream so loud this time."" With that he outed around half the bottle onto Lord Tully's hand."
WesterosRP,3do40h,JoronAlt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:39:51 2015 UTC,"John stared at the Maester with a heated irritated look, as bloody trickles down his chin from his mouth.  ""Scream Once and it for ever haunts you, anyway ive always been a screamer.""  Jorah moved his eye brows and changed his irritated expression to a sly look. He rubs his mouth of the blood from his left hand leaving a red stain on his shirt. Jorah began to speak in a jokey tone towards the Maester.  ""I know nothing of you Maester Cider or your sexual conquests"""
WesterosRP,3dmph4,honeybee__,5,Fri Jul 17 14:57:28 2015 UTC,"Horse riding was something Helaena preferred over dragon riding. Despite the blood that ran through her veins, she never had the courage to even attempt to raise one, and as a result the dragon that would of been hers was given to her sister, some one she deemed more fitted to raise the dragon than herself. Helaena preferred smaller things, ranging from small scared bunnies to horses, anything bigger and she would not have the courage to even look at it. In a way she could be a disappointment to the Targaryen family, with her fear of dragons, when she was one, but none of her family members ever expressed any disappointment, maybe they liked having some one different in the family.  ""For all the times I've kept her waiting... she would certainly have my head.."" The Princess mumbled as she drew closer to the stables. Helaena was spending her sweet time reading, like always, minding her own business, or submitting to the orders of those with 'higher status'. If she had wanted, which she did, she would of continued to read, and would of left her sister hanging, waiting. But Helaena was not known for that, she complied to the wishes of others, which isn't always a good thing.  When Helaena arrived, she saw her sister and the two horses out of their stables, waiting. ""...Valaena.."" She greeted quietly, a smile playing with her lips. ""Forgive me, I did not mean to keep you waiting."""
WesterosRP,3dmph4,AlmightyEnige,3,Fri Jul 17 17:38:43 2015 UTC,"Finally her sister had emerged.   ""It's no problem at all, sister,"" Valaena replied. ""Shall we?"" she gestured toward the horses.   Her sister was going to have difficulty she noted. Valaena had decided to put practicality over prettiness as she donned a pair of men's trousers and tunic. Helaena on the other hand had insisted on her usual flowy skirts.  This ride wouldn't be as fast as she thought.  Still, she did need to talk to Helaena and it wasn't exactly possible to do that whilst racing."
WesterosRP,3dmph4,AlmightyEnige,6,Sat Jul 18 13:58:04 2015 UTC,"Helaena nodded, and noticed the clothing her sister had decided to wear, frowning a little as she looked back to what she, herself, wore. ""You should of told me what to wear.."" She pouted as she climbed onto the horse, wrapping her fingers around the reigns. ""Shall we?"" She asked, motioning a hand to the exit/entrance of the stables."
WesterosRP,3dmph4,AlmightyEnige,3,Sat Jul 18 18:04:46 2015 UTC,"Valaena mounted her horse and off they went. Helaena was to choose where they go. They started at a slow trot.   ""So sister, what brings you here today?"" the youngest of the sisters asked."
WesterosRP,3dmph4,AlmightyEnige,3,Sun Jul 19 00:20:12 2015 UTC,"Helaena's eyebrows were brought together when Valaena spoke to her. ""Y..You did, sister... I would of been reading if you hadn't invited me out to ride."" She narrowed her eyes at her sister."
WesterosRP,3dmph4,AlmightyEnige,3,Sun Jul 19 03:29:44 2015 UTC,"""That was me being subtle, Hel, what's been happening with you lately? I haven't heard much from you at all?""   Valaena leaned back letting the horse slow."
