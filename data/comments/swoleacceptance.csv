Basically 7 days out from the weigh in stop eating carbs other than green veggies. Go /r/keto.  Ontop of your new keto diet start drinking a 1-2 gallons of water per day. You should be pissing all day.  Do this until day 6. On day 6 drink only 1 gallon of water. Then 18-24 hours before you step on the scale cut off all water. Your hormones will be tricked into a surplus of water so you'll keep pissing this whole time.  You may lose 5 lbs just from the keto diet in a week from depleting your glycogen stores.   You may want to drink a powerade zero while doing this because you will piss out a lot of electrolytes."

You basically only eat meat, dark green veggies, a little bit of dairy (full fat), and a little bit of nuts. Almost all fruit is off limits. A lot of veggies such as carrots and onions even have to be moderated. If you do go keto you need to <25 net carbs per day.  As for the water loading make sure to do some research first. If you're going to do it you might as well get cheaper insurance rates. $100 a month isn't chump change."

Currently cutting to 170, maybe below depending on how long it take and how I feel when I get there. If you don't have abs I would guess that 170 is pretty easily obtainable in not too much time and 170lbs at 5'7"" isn't small if you are lean. You can probably lose 3 or 4 lbs of water weight by cutting carbs and drying out. Then you just need to lose about 4 lbs of fat, which is easy too.

From the comments, I'm seeing it's common.  I've never dealt with life insurance, but is there no whey for them to look beyond a limited BMI measurement? They don't have exceptions for bodybuilders or other athletes that break the mold? There's always exceptions, they have to have a way to address them.   Is there no whey you can speak to a supervisor or higher up? They likely have a box to tick on your profile questionnaire and it likely doesn't have other options, so I can understand why a low-level sales rep wouldn't be able to change it. Someone higher up with more power should though.   Assuming you follow a more natural approach, you live a much healthier lifestyle than most of their applicants and you should be rewarded for it, not penalized."
swoleacceptance,3e0k53,thegainsfairy,2,Tue Jul 21 11:58:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean I was torn on a few levels. The most obvious one being I am NOT a body builder. I'm just not. I might lift weights 3-4 times a week, and I've gained a decent amount of muscle (I've basically done a years long re-comp), AND I really try to eat well, but nobody is going to confuse me for a damn athlete. So there's that.  And I did ask. She basically said it comes up now and then, but there's basically nothing they can do, they just go by height/weight ratio.  The other thing is it didn't strike me as really worth a huge production, especially when I'm not THAT serious about lifting, for like $12 a month. I get that it adds up, of course, but it seemed a little foolish. If I was crazy shredded and had a sick pack and huge chest MAYBE I'd fight the good fight, but I don't think I've been diligent enough to go that way."

swoleacceptance,3dvr4j,bswizel,2,Tue Jul 21 00:21:24 2015 UTC,for legday which should be everyday its fairly easy...for other body parts unless youre doing entire upper body i see how one would struggle with 3hours just for chest or back... for legs 1hour squatting another deadlifting and the final being accessories/isolation/warming up/mobility work is how i spent my 3hours

That said, I had some problems with PFPS a while back.  I saw an orthopedic specialist and while he did not lift, nor did he think I should, he still helped free me from Broki's clutches. Basically all he said to do was sit on a chair, strap an ankle weight to my leg, and lift that leg up and down with the knee locked out for ten reps. I was supposed to do that once every morning, afternoon, and night. And, after a few more weeks, it went away. I still have knee pain from time to time, especially right after I ramp up the volume, but going back to the leg lifts still helps to make it go away.

The cross-fitters is known for their perversion of Brodin's worship, through the heretical kipping and formless prayers. Some few, some very, very few, will in fact be Temples of Iron disguised as Houses of Broki, but these are few and far between and such noble pec-tors of our community are deserving of the greatest respect for infiltrating Broki's ranks and offering true worship to the Swolefather's glory.

swoleacceptance,3d294w,Snoop_Brodin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:47:59 2015 UTC,Gotta do a lil cardio to keep the fat away. Make it horizontal only and keep your work to a max of 30 minutes of low intensity steady state. Sprint to the finish with some HIITS to get a good mix of the two.
swoleacceptance,3d1t6a,lokisbane,6,Sun Jul 12 20:52:55 2015 UTC,"Out of character - Push. Push hard. Put more weight on the bar. Doing a 5x5 at 250? Do that shit at 260. Don't be afraid of failing a squat. Sure, failing sucks, but it means you are working hard. You will improve if you add weight for the same amount of reps.  I fell into the same rut a little while back. I went nearly a year without even failing a squat, but in return I saw fewer gains. Failure is a natural part of everything, especially lifting.  May Brodin be with you brother, and let the light of the All Spotter guide your path."
swoleacceptance,3d1t6a,NoobWithSkills,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:14:32 2015 UTC,It's actually my one rep max. I will try doing more with the rep progression. Thank you my brother. May Brodin bless you. Can you explain why maybe my getting stronger in the deadlift made my back squat stronger?
swoleacceptance,3d1t6a,NoobWithSkills,4,Sun Jul 12 21:29:55 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda spitballing here, but maybe you are more confident deadlifting, and therefore seeing more gains there. Deadlifting and squatting do hit some of the same muscles, which would help out your squat. But, obviously, the exercise that will improve your squat the most is squatting. We've all had that fear of heavy squatting before, and I honestly think what you are looking for is just a little confidence.   Happy lifting brother :)"
swoleacceptance,3d1t6a,greyedoutfield,5,Sun Jul 12 23:37:40 2015 UTC,"Try front squats or doing a workout where you push heavy laddering singles.  Mixing up the rep vs weights and doing variations has helped me in the past.  Also, are you crying tears of whey? (Are you eating enough?)"
swoleacceptance,3d1t6a,greyedoutfield,2,Sun Jul 12 21:26:54 2015 UTC,"I'm eating a ton. Maybe 4000 calories a day and at least 120 grams of protein a day too. I cry tears of whey and creatine, brother. I tried front squats and reached 215 for one rep with them. Then did a few weeks of 20 rep front squats and made it to 150 for 20. Did gain a little mass but nothing for strength. The only thing that really helped my back squat has been getting stronger in the deadlift."
swoleacceptance,3d1t6a,DeathtoPants,2,Sun Jul 12 21:32:52 2015 UTC,"Food intake was a long shot, but worth asking.  Have you tried something that ladders up you squat like Stronglifts?  Also, what's your squat frequency?  Are you drinking enough water (with a pinch of salt in it)?  Sleeping enough? (Just trying to cover the basics)"
swoleacceptance,3d1t6a,DeathtoPants,2,Sun Jul 12 21:41:04 2015 UTC,"My sodium intake is a bit low. Could that help? And a year or more ago before my deadlift went up I tried squatting once a week with a one rep max then the following week try to make that a 3 rep max and then the week after making it a 5 rep max, but that didn't work."
swoleacceptance,3d1t6a,Uberslaughter,2,Sun Jul 12 21:44:35 2015 UTC,"Try squatting twice every week, that might help. It's possible waiting an entire week between each sessing is causing you to lose your gains, especially if you're not using your muscles much outside of the temple."
swoleacceptance,3d1t6a,greyedoutfield,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:23:27 2015 UTC,I will go back to that. But I'm afraid of doing too much. Can I deadlift twice a week too?
swoleacceptance,3d1t6a,pagan2287,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:03:21 2015 UTC,"I am by no means an authority on this, but from what I can tell DL twice a week with heavy weights isn't ideal, especially if you're doing squats as well."
swoleacceptance,3d1t6a,etham,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:24:51 2015 UTC,"Do both twice a week. And for more poignant and specific advice, try /r/fitness"
swoleacceptance,3d1t6a,etham,2,Sun Jul 12 23:31:10 2015 UTC,"Low sodium and potassium intake doesn't help if you're exercising regularly.  But most people get enough sodium.  The pinch of salt in the water aids the water absorption, I've found it helpful but YMMV. You can squat and deadlift more than once a week (Starting Strength and Stronglifts go with 3 days squatting), just be mindful that the closer you go to your 1RM and trained you get, the more recovery time you need."
swoleacceptance,3d1t6a,etham,2,Mon Jul 13 01:43:31 2015 UTC,"Add weight every time you squat. Add weight between sets. I do an 8,5,3 workout. 2 sets at 8 reps with weight x, then 2 sets of 5 reps with increased weight, then 2 sets of 3 reps with even more weight. The weight I am adding is usually another 10-20 lbs at a time. Next time you squat you start at a slightly higher weight than last time. Lather,rinse repeat. Remember lift with your muscles, not your ego and be safe. Obligatory-Wheymen"
swoleacceptance,3d1t6a,Seuguh,2,Sun Jul 12 23:33:34 2015 UTC,Is your form spot on? Bad form could be a reason that your squat isn't improving. I used to think I had a decent squat until a coach pointed out to me all the things I was doing wrong. Basically dropped all my weight back to down to 1 plate and started from scratch.
swoleacceptance,3d1t6a,Seuguh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:05:26 2015 UTC,I think to utilize my hips more and my stronger glutes I should squat with a wider stance.
swoleacceptance,3d1t6a,neoconfection,3,Mon Jul 13 00:11:36 2015 UTC,"Here are some tips that I was given when my coach was helping me with my form:  1) Bar movement should only ever be up and down, completely vertical. If your bar swings in any way, your foundation is weak.  2) Quads should go, at minimum, parallel with the floor or deeper if you can.  3) Push off with your heels  4) Keep your wrists straight and look up without craning your neck. This will help to keep your back tight.  5) Either squat barefoot or squat in shoes that are completely flat and have a thin sole (i.e. weight-lifting shoes, chuck taylors, etc). This goes hand in hand with a stable foundation. If you wear running shoes, they can affect your rise out of the hole by causing your to rock forward or backwards.  Good luck brah"

swoleacceptance,3cw1l0,CySurflex,11,Sat Jul 11 06:34:14 2015 UTC,"Time for some real talk:   70% is diet, 30% is the gym.   You NEED to eat well - first and foremost it is the fuel that regenerates your muscles and gives you the energy to lift, secondly it is going to be the quickest avenue to visible changes. As anecdotal evidence, I'm a big fan of pop/soda and am guilty of drinking far too much of it - by simply drinking only water, black unsweetened coffee, pre-workout and brotein I shed at least 5 lbs a week, with no change in lifestyle other than that. If you can cut sugars from your diet, that is a huge step. Make fruit your junk food, and if you want to get more intense about it, get a scale and weight your food - after a while you will get a sense of how much is a good portion size and can relax on the weighing. I must add that when people 'cut' they generally count calories and macros, which means utilization of a scale. It ain't the worst to get into that habit. Easier to say no to a bag of chips than to cardio it off.   As much as Disciples will admonish the thought of cardio (spit), it is a necessary thing. The reason it's frowned upon is because performing it can diminish gains in that it doesn't allow your muscles to recover properly. BUT, this is only true of people doing far more advanced routines that depend on a full resting cycle per muscle/muscle group. In the beginning and even at a novice level, it is my opinion that it can only help - if anything, 10 minutes on a bike/rowing machine/elliptical (great on the knees as it is low impact) previous to your lifting routine will warm you up, and add at least 100 calories to your daily total.   LIFTING - my fucking bread and butter m8. This is the fun part. I would suggest checking out Starting Strength http://startingstrength.com/ or even Ice Cream 5x5 https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/jason-blaha-ice-cream-fitness-5x5-novice-workout . I started out with starting strength, and love(d) it - am now doing Ice Cream. SS will give you mad initial strength gains, which will allow you to have a better base when doing hypertrophy (vanity) stuff later on. Ice Cream is still pretty strength oriented, but has more hypertrophy worked in. Strength building is generally low repetition/high weight, while hypertrophy exercised as more geared towards high rep/low(er) weight.   My biggest advice to you is this - leave your ego at the door. That is to say, don't lift beyond your capability because you think others are judging you. Put together a playlist that will get you JACKED UP TO LIFT and play that shit while you lift - get into the zone bruv! Accept help! People involved in this pastime/hobby/thing you do other than Life are generally super helpful and more than willing to pass on knowledge. Concentrate on form, the plates will follow - better to have perfect form with an empty bar than look like a chump with two plates on each side <- real talk.   Good luck, we're all gonna make it!!!"

swoleacceptance,3cw1l0,Im_Mr_Skeltal,5,Sun Jul 12 05:57:46 2015 UTC,Brother why choose when you can have both!!! I am over 150 pounds lighter than when I 'twas grasped by the evil Broki. What worketh for me was doing full body every time I was praying. Using supersets of 3x10 with 60 seconds between each prayer. Just superset an upper-body excercise with a lower or full body. Your weigts will not be as high as if you were 5x5ing but you will lose more weight. My favourite was cable back row with a superset of dumbbell snatches 10 on each side. Do that 3 times with 60 seconds between supersets (Google superset if not familiure). Also warm up with an all out sprint. I couldn't do more than half a kilo when o started so go a quarter mile as an all out sprint for a warm up. Let the pounds fall brother.
swoleacceptance,3cw1l0,Splineline,2,Sat Jul 11 16:25:55 2015 UTC,And one more thing. Eat eggs and meat every morning with pleanty of butter used in the pan and with eggs. The first meal of your day should be really high fat with at least 30 grams of protein with no carbs. The first meal of the day dictates where your body looks for calories to burn. High fat meals make your body use a higher % of fat for fuel in the day.......................... Also carb cycling is your best friend on the path of smole. This is where ethnicity plays a big part in how many days you should go. My family's herritage is Irish and French. I had to go at least  3 days very low carb one day high carb. If historically speaking your place of heritage eats a ton of carbs for food (we're talking hunter gather style) then you can go as low as one day on one day off. What worked best for me was just once a week I would go high carb. If your ancestors are something say German or from the neither lands. You may need to go as long as 10 days on 1 day carb. Sorry for the long posts i had a lot to say lol.

swoleacceptance,3co7xw,KGB_Bear,7,Thu Jul 9 19:50:18 2015 UTC,"99% is probably way too high, but look at it this way. It's pretty much fact that at almost every sport where steroid testing is done begrudgingly (i.e. basically all sports besides natural powerlifting competitions) at least a few athletes are taking steroids. Now, those guys are busting their assess off with hardwork and using steroids. So for anyone else to compete at their level, they also have to either be using steroids, be very gifted genetically, or working harder then the original individual. Now eventually you're going to run into an athlete who is willing to work at least as hard as everyone else, but is also willing to take steroids. Now they have a leg up and dominate their tier. Now maybe they start getting competition from people who work equally as hard, but have better genetics. Then you run into the issue where someone with excellent genetics and a competitve work ethic starts taking steroids. So then they make a new competitive tier that really can't be beat until someone comes along with a superior training method or superior genetics. At the top-tier its pretty much a given all those athletes are training equally hard, so the only way to pull ahead of the pact is to be naturally gifted on top of everything else, have a new training method that no one else is doing (which rarely stays exclusive to you for long), or to be juicing."
swoleacceptance,3co7xw,Ailodierap,3,Thu Jul 9 20:10:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the point of view.

I've also had 2 different people admit it to me (pretty much a stranger, granted on they see regularly) at my gym. Some people just prefer ez, potentially dangerous gains. Once I started looking for it on r/Fitness, you can tell its pretty rampant. People don't admit it to it out of hand, but when you look at some of these people's workout schedules its pretty telling.  ""No big deal, I just squat and deadlift my max for reps multiple times a week. Oh, I'm also cutting and run 8-miles on my days off. Ez 6% bodyfat. Time to go hit a PR on my bench!""  For beginners, okay maybe sure, but when you're near 4 digits on your numbers and still making crazy progress and cutting there's only 1 explanation."

I live in southern Ontario where a lot of professional hockey players come out of. I have been lucky and have been in the gym with people that now years later are in the NHL. Of the four people I worked out next to, they all gained over 17 pounds between the OHL and NHL without a change in height. This is over the course of just the off season. I know the counter argumenta, but it isn't there first year training. They have all been training including lifting since they were young. A well trained individual especially in a ( trigger warning ) cardio focused sport gaining 17 pounds in under 6 months. Your call if you want to believe it as natural.

swoleacceptance,3cmzwz,DeathtoPants,4,Thu Jul 9 14:13:19 2015 UTC,"Very admirable brother. Welcome to Hell! Gojira is an awesome band (fun fact; they get their name for how Japanese people say godzilla) and Opeth kills it. Some bands I can recommend are Aeon (EXTREMELY satanic) Amon Amarth  (viking metal. Yes viking metal exists and so do pirate metal like Alestom [I'm convinced it's a play of Halestorm, but I came up with that myself and have never heard anyone else mention it]), Bloodbath (use to be fronted by the  current vocalist for Opeth), Battlecross  (representing from my home city of Detroit), Cannibal Corpse, Decapitated, Dying Fetus, Fleshgod Apocalypse  (Hollllllly shitttttttt), Hate Eternal (HOLLLLLLLY SHITTTTTTTT), Hour of Penance (used to  be fronted by Fleshgod Apocalypse front man. Also, I like their album Paradogma more than their newer stuff), Job for a Cowboy (their first EP Doom is deathcore,  which is a different discussion, but everything after is straight deathmetal), Meshuggah  (listen to their song Bleed immediately. I mean right now. Stop reading this, look up that song, and then come back to this). My 3 favorite bands in ascending order are Behemoth (the craziest live show I have ever seen and probably ever will see [RIP Oderus]) The Black Dahlia Murder (MASSIVE following. Also from Detroit,  and I run into their vocalist from time to time at shows in Detroit. Trevor is my god), and finally The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza (my favorite band ever, not together anymore, mathmetal instead of deathmetal, and I named my pet hedgehog after the guitarist Josh Travis)."

I meant that I never saw gwar with oderus fronting, and I heard from many people that gwar was the best show they have ever seen. So that was a statement more along the lines that the only band I could have seen outperform behemoth was gwar and I refuse to see gwar without oderus  Edit: oderus with behemoth would have been hilarious though"

And truthfully I'm kind of proud of girls being more assertive and whatnot it's just they need to learn the ""no touching"" rule IMO.  I think part of it is a lot of guys like girls groping on them so these girls don't always get told no for doing the same stuff.  I know some guys would love a girl putting their arms around them, but I'm really sensitive to certain types of touching and a girl lightly putting her hands on my shoulders is just not a fun feeling.  It's overload.  I just wish more women would respect the ""hands off"" idea until they got to know me a bit more, (like wait for me to tell you that you're cute, at least lol).  I just thought I'd give it a shot by asking you guys.  I would understand if no one else knows how to do this.  I would even understand if other guys actualy enjoy what I dislike."
swoleacceptance,3cd3tr,Seuguh,4,Tue Jul 7 00:12:07 2015 UTC,"Some good advice in here, thus far.    But, I hate to say this;  I think your energies would be better served in focusing on conquering the fear of being touched instead of coming up with clever ways of telling people that you don't like to be touched.  The latter is a stopgap solution to a larger and more pressing issue.  Touching is a normal and wonderful part of friendly human interaction.  Conquer that fear."
swoleacceptance,3cd3tr,truebeliever23,5,Tue Jul 7 02:02:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks, brother.  It's a pretty common ""symptom"" of the medical issue I have, but as I get older I've found myself opening up to it more.  It's just that I'm very sensitive to touch is all.    People touching me doesn't do the same things to me that it does to a normal person.  People aren't so bad but some other things are horrible to touch for me.  Sometimes using paper towels to dry my hands feels like I'm using sandpaper.  Sometimes it flat hurts just to touch my hand to a piece of paper or the desk I'm writing on, as if my hands are so dry they're bleeding.  Another thing is if I touch anything that's like foam it almost feels like electricity is traveling down my spine and it hurts.  But then even though it feels that way it's like the pain is different, not like real pain.  People touching me don't do that to me nearly as much (though I REALLY don't like hoisery or polyester stuff girls wear), it's just that it does for the first split seconds something touches me it feels more like a really uncomfortable static than a pleasurable sensation.  I really like to have some warning before it happens or I will probably get very tense and freeze up."
swoleacceptance,3cd3tr,ultrazero,5,Tue Jul 7 02:44:29 2015 UTC,"Dude, you're a man. Don't be afraid to draw the a line even it offends people's feelings. Protect your neck first, then worry about how others feel about shit. This world is unforgiving.  That is why you lift, brother, to receive the strength for which you repped. Mental and physical strength. If you don't like being touched, just say it, speak your mind. It's your first right as a man. Your words create your reality, so use your words to draw a line in your reality.  Also, if you're that unaware, girls don't touch guys they're not interested in. Women are very aware with these things. So if they're fondling your muscles or are finding excuses to touch you during conversations, it's because they want to perform horizontal cardio. If you're interested, mirror back, slap an ass , tickle etc."

Lifting has become what we call a ""coping mechanism."" for you.  A coping mechanism sounds way worse than it is because it's usually used as a reference to alcohol or drug use, but in reality everyone could benefit from a learned behavior or mechanism to help cope with the (paraphrased) ""confusing and unnerving swirl of life,"" we all feel sometimes.  But this is a good thing for you.  For one a lot of people cope by drinking, smoking or taking pills.  Some just binge Netflix which is neither healthy or unhealthy (usually).  But you actually have a healthy, constructive coping mechanism which IMO is one of the most important things a person can have.  The rest of your life will not be so simple or fulfilling otherwise you wouldn't appreciate just how simple and fulfilling lifting is.  Everything would blend into one big pool of sameness."

I used to hate squats but now that I always do them first I don't anymore. I squat MWF and always the first thing I do. While my legs are fresh, otherwise you will want to skip out on them. Deadlift is hard, but squating (I think) requires more of you mentally and physically."
swoleacceptance,3bkjwe,tuxedoburrito,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:45:41 2015 UTC,I usually leave squats last because after a 10 second rest they just get locked and hurts pretty bad if I try to go down :/. Is it because I'm not warming up correctly?
swoleacceptance,3bkjwe,EntGuyHere,3,Tue Jun 30 21:11:41 2015 UTC,"It could be a number of things.  Here is an article on squatting.  Here's a video from Body Builder.com  Always squat first, mate. Try going down on weight, whatever your max is do half of that. Say your max is 225, just start at 110 lb, squat that successfully and then add weight each time you lift until you've gained control of your bar, form, and have an effective workout (this will take a few weeks).  More importantly than how much weight you put up is HOW you put it up. Form is infinitely more important than weight.  Yesterday at the gym I saw this blonde little gym bunny squatting 50 lbs more than my last set, but she was only going down like 1/4 of a total squat. Which maybe she really just wanted to work out a very specific muscle, but she wasn't getting a full workout out of it. Just wasting time.  In between my sets I wait at least 3 minutes. I bring a timer. Reg Parks, the yahoo who trained Schwarzenegger, recommends in between sets to wait 3-5 minutes for maximum recovery.  Hope this helps."
swoleacceptance,3bkjwe,tuxedoburrito,3,Tue Jun 30 21:23:54 2015 UTC,"Pretty interesting video and also the article, it seems that my technique is similar so no problem there.  Currently I'm doing No weight squats. Since I'm still heavy I'm trying to go easy on my knees but the problem I'm talking about is in my quads :/  What I've seen that works for me (but I think this is not a permanent solution) is to do 15 to 20 reps, rest 10 to 15 seconds and so on until I reach the 5 or 6 series. If I wait more they start to cramp (I guess?) and to lock :(. But nevertheless the info that you provided is still helpful for future references, thank you!"

If thy shirts become an unwearable cloth prison and yee waste is thy-same then fret not.   But seriously I had the same mental problem. You just don't want to be big anymore and wearing medium shirts is awesome. The waist measurement is the only scale you need to worry about.  P.S. Same thing will happen when your ass gets swole from squats.
swoleacceptance,3bniw9,Splineline,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:41:21 2015 UTC,"My only tape measures are my pants and belt.  I have shrunk from 44 down to 32, been steady in that range and on the same belt loop for many months now.  It is the upper body that gets a bit concerning.  When you come from decades of having flabby moobs, turning them into pecs that jut out from the shirt, old thoughts such as, ""I tried to get RID of those, what are they doing back?!"" can tend to creep in.  Depending on the cut, my shirts go anywhere from S to L.  I shall try to overcome this mental block with another day of 10 rep Zercher prayer sets.

swoleacceptance,3bk58v,rich_ripped_redneck,3,Tue Jun 30 19:03:35 2015 UTC,"There is a moment when you first decide to let go of friends who, while important in the past, have become detrimental to your life. This editing is constructive for it frees up space in your life for better relationships.  Still, it's tough and requieres some grieving.  I still feel sad for choosing to not have some childhood friends in my life. I would have a much higher regret if I had wasted years on them or felt that they kept on holding me down to their level of mediocrity.  Also, as you age your friendships will no longer be based on whether you both like Spiderman and candy, and more in other topics.  Grown up friendships and redefinitions with age is a complicating, and potentially satisfying topic. Best of luck!"

He has probably studied Buddhism or Zen and though he may understand it, he hasn't attained understanding. Let me rewrite his article for him.   Guys, don't lift weights because you think you are supposed to. Get physical fitness from activity you enjoy.  If you are chasing size and numbers lifting you will lose the simple life affirming joy of the process. Exercise in a way that makes you feel alive.   However, if you are going to lift, then lift mindfully, not mindlessly. Lifting can be a form of meditation. When lifting only lift. Don't worry about anything outside the gym, don't worry about past or future. Be present and focus on your relationship with this moment and the iron.   Treat the iron like a beautiful woman (or man) who requires your constant attention. Keep your awareness in your body. Feel your breath. Feel the tension. Feel the fatigue. Accept them without resistance. Push the weight. Then push the weight. Then push the weight. All that exists in the moment is this one rep.   If your mind wanders don't be annoyed or angry. Simply return your focus to the iron. Each time your focus wanders and you return to what you are doing that is one mental rep. These mental reps will make you swole of spirit. Use the iron temple to strengthen both body and mind.   Sorry if that is a little hippy for some of you. But I have found spending my time in the gym chopping wood and carrying water is very positive."

Sure, but that doesn't mean weights don't work. Just because somebody does it differently than you doesn't mean it's wrong.   While living in Bali, I met some seriously ripped dudes. A lot of them were surfers, and many more were practicing yoga.   Yay? Nobody said Yoga was bad.   Among them was Moshe, who at 6'4 and with muscle to spare, looked like he was definitely doing squats and bench presses on a regular basis.   Because he was.   But the reality was he was more likely to be found meditating, Qigong and yoga than pumping iron.   No, he was doing squats. Meditation is great and all but it's no substitute for lifting heavy weights. What do you mean 'more likely,' did you ask? Do you have any idea or are you just tossing that in there to fit your narrative?  EDIT: I was incorrect Moshe is merely an assortment of pool noodles with poor squat form.   Just one look at this brother and you could tell he wasn't just talking about being healthy and mindful, he was living it.    Well here's some abstract mess.   Something about his patience, awareness and ear-to-ear grin inspired me to follow his routine — the ""conscious workout"" — no weight-lifting required.    Next you're going to tell me to project an energy field.   This approach to fitness has led to me being totally and completely present when I workout instead of mindlessly counting reps until I reach an arbitrary number.   Well the only conclusion here is that you suck at lifting. Your counting should not be so easy that it is mindless, nor should the number be 'arbitrary.'    It's about quality, not quantity.    It's about both. Nice try.   For years, I wore bespoke suits every day and I'd be lying if I said I didn't like looking good in my clothes.    It's nice that you're rich enough to afford that.   My time spent working out certainly helped me achieve a nice sartorial fit, but there were guys in the gym who looked like if they were to flex just a little bit more, their clothes would split at the seams.   I fail to see a problem.   I wondered why us guys were so conditioned to want huge muscles, even with our high school ""glory days"" behind us.    I'm beginning to think you could never achieve the big muscles and hated lifting so you've decided there's something fundamentally 'wrong,' because it's something you can't do. In a word, you're jealous.   Now, I understand that it's more important to have a quality workout resulting in sustained energy and fitness, rather than one that focuses on repetitions and achievement-based results that diminish quickly over time.    Again, you must really suck at lifting.    Fitness shouldn't be something you dread.     If you hate it then don't do it, doesn't mean it's bad or other people don't enjoy it.   After years of practicing yoga in a studio, Qigong on a grassy knoll or meditation in a cave (literal and figurative!), I now understand that they all lead to the same path of mind, body and spirit connection. The thread that connects each of these practices is holistic, serving all three layers of who I am equally.   What the fuck is this shit.   I want to look forward to my workout routine, not dread stepping into a gym the way I did for most of my younger years. Work time is work time, and workout time should be ""you"" time, don't you agree?   Okay so you found something you enjoy, that doesn't mean everyone else's enjoyment is wrong.   So put down those weights just because you think it's what you're supposed to be doing. Never do something because someone has told you to, do something because you want to, because it brings you joy and grounds you and let's you live in the present.   Which is why people fucking lift.  EDIT: Holy shit is 'Moshe' the dude in the video? He's not ripped at all. What are you talking about?  EDIT EDIT: Oh my god ALL OF YOU HAVE THE WORST SQUAT FORM I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE I HOPE TO BRODIN THAT YOU WOULDN'T SQUAT A BAR LIKE THAT."

There are plenty of restaurants and sweet shops where OP admits to having partaken more than their fair share. OP has been praying consistently for several months, though has never consulted a trainer (priest) to ensure the form is proper. Because there aren't many gyms in the area, OP only found a crossfit trainer/paleo enthusiast. So while trainer does know crossfit movements, it's still crossfit.   The trainer did give some pointers on back squat and dead lift, as well as OHP (I think). ""Don't worry, every time I go into this crossfit gym, I don't even think about actually doing crossfit because fuck that. There's no bench and the monthly rate is too damn high"". Also, according to Crossfit Chris in the OP, if you really wanna be a strong lifter, you gotta work your primal movements! Like the cavemen.  The dilemma: ""I used to wear Chuck's to the gym, but they're all worn out now. So instead, I bought some crossfit shoes at the crossfit gym because i'm crossfucked with no real gym nearby!"" The shoes are alright (firm sole, metatarsal strap), but the heel isn't as high as Oly lift shoes. They also have a crossfit logo on them. I don't like ordering shoes online, because I like to try shoes on before I buy. There's no sporting goods stores nearby, so what do?

She was but a mere messenger of Brodin reminding you of your true elixir. She is a true believer since she did that instead of offering alcohol, the forbidden gain killing beverage, as many flying agents of Broki do. When the unenlightened family said you were a freak, it was a way to remind you that you have left humanity behind, a noble achievement in the quest for salvation and a sure action that takes you closer to swolehalla. Moreover, on their (very vast) inside, those people each wish they had the courage and strength to become a freak beast, but their internal conflict leads them to a natural human reaction, laugh. We shall lift in sets of five for them. When your cotton gain compliment started to shred, it was so that you knew you could rip it off completely and be amazed at your gains. No fabric can contain you now, and that is something to celebrate as your are closer to not fitting through doorways.   So you see brother, Brodin works in mysterious ways, but we as wanderers of the iron path are tasked with interpreting the situations the all spotter lifts us into.

Heavy sets of 5 reps won't give you a pump but will make you strong af, while moderate to low weight sets of 8-10 will flush your muscles with blood and swell you up with a pump.  Advice, if I may: Do a strength program first, build a solid base of muscles, then work on pumping them up. What are your numbers  on bench, squat, deadlift, and OHP?"
swoleacceptance,3b92i6,Seuguh,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:38:49 2015 UTC,"Bench has moved to 200lbs since I've started with creatine.  Squat also be about 210lbs. I haven't done deadlift because I don't have the free weight bar or the proper equipment.  But whenst I did it, 'twas about 240lbs.  As for OHP. I was and always have been weak and can press about 90lbs. :(  I wish I had more, but having these tall limbs and long muscles makes it hard to accomplish anything."

I did crossfit for two years under a coach with a powerlifting background. He forbade anyone doing kipping pull-ups and programmed our routine to build strength. From there I moved into powerlifting under his guidance. While we may walk different paths we're all children of the iron.
