HelpMeFind,3e5xbp,Schuyler72,3,Wed Jul 22 05:11:27 2015 UTC,My dad says that he had it before we moved it about 10 years ago and it was lost in the move (not sure if it was stolen or actually lost). He ran the torch in 1984 for the summer Olympics as a teenager and he said if he finds it that he will pass it down to me. It means a lot to me because I am a crazy fan of the Olympics. Help me please. Thank you!

School is not in session currently, but the school board office should be open. They should be able to offer you some sound advice there too. Many of the board members were teachers at one time. You would have to Google their locations.   If you do leave, it would be wise to ensure you have all important documentation you can find. Birth certificate, SIN numbers, any official school records etc. If you have a family member you can trust, maybe they can keep them safe for you.

HelpMeFind,3e185f,LostGrant1,2,Tue Jul 21 04:21:38 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you may be suffering from depression :(  http://www.helpguide.org/articles/depression/depression-signs-and-symptoms.htm  I know that this may be weird, coming from a stranger, but I understand how you feel :(  I'm not an expert, but I suggest trying to do the things that you used to enjoy; as well as trying to work out your feelings by perhaps using art as a vessel to communicate how you're feeling inside, or possibly writing about your emotions. It may sound cliche, but pouring your emotions down on paper can help you to feel a lot better! :)  Also, another thing to remember is that, as weird as it may sound, it's okay to be sad! Feeling different emotions is part of life!  Let your emotions out, it's okay to cry, as it is okay to laugh; and feel however you are feeling! However, too much sadness can be harmful, as well; and can affect your life :(  And, I know that there comes a time where you feel tired of being sad; and want to be able to feel happy again.  Even though it may not seem like it, I assure you; in time, the dark cloud will eventually pass, and you will be able to feel happy again! :)  Also, even though it may not seem like it, there are people who do truly care about you!! :) I suggest that you talk to these people about how you're feeling, so that they can help to give you support.  I would also perhaps suggest talking to a psychiatrist, psychologist, or even a guidance counselor about what you're going through.  I understand how you're feeling. It is a very unpleasant feeling.  Just know that you are not alone, and that there are others who will understand!  :)  One thing to always remember: whatever you are going through in life, it could always be worse; this is a perspective that has helped me! :)  I hope that I have been of a help to you, in some small way; and that you feel better soon!  Best wishes! :)"
