The ratio of clay to other minerals is variable.  Shale is characterized by breaks along thin laminae or parallel layering or bedding less than one centimeter in thickness, called fissility.  Mudstones, on the other hand, are similar in composition but do not show the fissility.

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.  So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

shubreddit,2jjsvp,SockofBadKarma,8,Fri Oct 17 21:21:00 2014 UTC,"lol? They are German. They said so themselves, and their comment history proves it.  They didn't get it at first because scheiße is pronounced ""shai-suh"", not ""shai-zuh"", so they didn't read it in a way that would make sense when comparing it to the English ""size"". I didn't get it either since I speak German as a second language; it only works for someone who doesn't know how to pronounce the word.  It's still mildly humorous, of course; I don't fault starck for the pun, and it probably works well for a lot of readers!"
