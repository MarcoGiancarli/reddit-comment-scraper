PlayItAgainSam,3doi83,Chevron,3,Sat Jul 18 17:52:47 2015 UTC,"Well, I dunno....I guess it might be just how serious he is when he says it.

PlayItAgainSam,3c6bi7,Alexrock88,22,Sun Jul 5 06:25:40 2015 UTC,Does anyone have any evidence that Pao is behind this whole thing? Or is she just a favorite scapegoat
PlayItAgainSam,3c6bi7,yitzaklr,-6,Sun Jul 5 07:00:52 2015 UTC,"Well, she is pretty clearly making moves as CEO of the company away from what the site was, and promised to be (free speech, etc.) and towards a place where there is much more censorship, and banning. We need to keep in mind that after Alexis stepped down as CEO, Pao was placed as interim until they found someone more capable. Then she got comfortable, and when she was reminded that she was just an interim CEO she said You'll have to pry this [CEO] position from my cold, dead hands!!!""   Does that sound like someone you would like running this site? I'm not even getting into the lawsuit, as it really doesn't apply to evidence against her leadership competence per se, rather evidence against her character."
PlayItAgainSam,3c6bi7,yitzaklr,16,Sun Jul 5 07:08:30 2015 UTC,"Source on any of that? Also, those are both irrelevant to whether she was involved in the whole thing, or whether the reddit admins were actually justified in it."
PlayItAgainSam,3c6bi7,David-Puddy,-4,Sun Jul 5 07:17:55 2015 UTC,"It's from the AMA of a former Reddit employee. She fired him after he did not recover fast enough from Leukemia, as he states in his AMA. As CEO, you are responsible for quite a lot of company decisions, so it is hard to see how she could NOT be involved."
PlayItAgainSam,3c6bi7,GusFringus,16,Sun Jul 5 07:50:09 2015 UTC,"yeah, we have the word of one guy who lost his job.  that's definitely not the whole story.  And even then, the way he described it made Pao/Reddit.Inc look really good.  He was supposed to be able to go back to work after 6mths-1year, and then, very unfortunately for him, he went into remission.  Not wanting to wait indefinitely, they gave him continued access to the healthplan...  You can't realistically/reasonably expect a company to just keep paying a guy indefinitely in case he can come back to work, cancer or no cancer."
PlayItAgainSam,3c6bi7,TheMegaBenson,24,Sun Jul 5 17:35:09 2015 UTC,"Nice to know that the mods of this sub are whiny babies, too.  People take this website too goddamn seriously."
PlayItAgainSam,3c6bi7,spoon_1234,11,Sun Jul 5 17:59:46 2015 UTC,Agreed
PlayItAgainSam,3c6bi7,David-Puddy,8,Sun Jul 5 18:11:05 2015 UTC,"Everything I've seen about the ""reddit black out"" has made me cringe. What a dumb thing."
PlayItAgainSam,3c6bi7,TheMegaBenson,6,Sun Jul 5 19:41:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty funny that anyone thinks this petition will do anything.  First of all, it's very likely Pao, as the CEO, had very little, if anything, to do with firing a specific employee.  Secondly, no one knows why she was fired. Maybe she went to their offices and shat on all of their desks. We don't know.  Thirdly, you think the company gives two shits about a change.org petition? Those things are so easy to dupe, they are meaningless. With the smallest amount of effort, I could sign that petition hundreds of times....  In conclusion, I'm glad to have PlayItAgainSam back, but in all honesty, I hadn't even noticed it went dark."
