Eminem,3e3p8w,ChampagneCJ,3,Wed Jul 22 00:14:28 2015 UTC,"But besides jokes about his physique and hairstyle and personal actions, he doesn't get critiqued that much, especially musically. But what people say about Eminem online is mainly about his skill and prominence and overall talent regarding his rapping, which might actually affect how he goes about his trade."

He didn't really rap about Kim directly throughout the album, and a 2 year anniversary is a little short considering they started out in middle school.  I imagined Stronger Than I Was was a little similar to Beautiful Pain in that after a break up you have the ability to be...well, the title. It's not out of the question to think eminem has tried dating, especially due to his skirting away from publicity. But he has been open about his drug use and that woke shebang.  Maybe one day we'll have more concrete interpretations? I'm sure our English teachers could find a way to prove us both wrong."

Eminem,3dt08z,MarshallMatters3,46,Sun Jul 19 04:12:32 2015 UTC,"Every time a new song gets released guaranteed there's 5 people in the comments who say ""he sucks now."" The thing is Eminem has NEVER had a constant style, take a listen through infinite and then listen to the MMLP. Then try SSLP and the Eminem Show, the fact is Em has been evolving and changing his style every 1-2 albums since he started, Infinite-SSEP Era: you have rap battle em, slow rhymes with a Nas overtone. MMLP-ES Era, calm but powerful, lots of bangers and the drive of a hungry MC. Encore-King Mathers Era, drugs, some of his worst and best stuff came out from here, style is all over the place. Relapse era, his most technical rhymes ever produced, overuse of accents but very impressive rhymes that couldn't be done without them, just listen to the Westwood freestyle that came out of here. Recovery era, some of the greatest production work and amazing word play, I'm still catching hidden puns and double enntants when listening to this album and BME. MMLP2 Era: So accents didn't work out but em sill wants to rhyme 400 syllable words, so what does he do? He chops the flow, he has complete fucking mastery of his breath control and is able to do so with ease, he's already told you his whole life story so now he's just trying to get the most impressive rhymes out there and he's killing it.  No, Eminem has not fallen off, he's not worse than he was in 00' 02' 04' 08' or 11' he's just diffrent."

He has changed his style in every album, his voice and delivery are always slightly or greatly different from his last. Personally I love his new material but I'd expect a new solo album from him to sound different from his current stuff just because that fits in with the pattern of his career"
Eminem,3dt08z,SimShade,7,Sun Jul 19 08:07:14 2015 UTC,"That's so true, his delivery switches up every album.   Infinite - AZ & Nas, vintage sound  SSLP - High pitched, nasally, cartoonish  MMLP - Not cartoonish, less rapping and more talking to the fans   TES - Yelling and preaching to the audience   Encore - Slurred, deep and still talking to his fans  Relapse - Accents with some normal rapping delivery   Recovery - Shouting, rapping and talking   MMLP2 - Rapping nasally but obviously with a deeper voice, shouting"

I feel if he would be stuck in the ""old Em"" days he would have no progression as an artist or as a person, would be stuck in place, and that's not what I want for him or for me as his fan.  I think a lot of people want to have that feeling of listening to something new yet familiar, but if you have an artist that always pops the same material over and over and over you will eventually have someone like how Nickelback turned out to be, and look at them now; they started good but all their songs sound the same and now they're a laughing stock among many communities.  He always have and still continues to affect my life quite a lot. I wish there was a direct way for me to contact him just to say thank you and to keep saying fuck all the haters."
Eminem,3dt08z,SimShade,2,Sun Jul 19 06:53:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Music isn't static and as a result it requires evolution, Em has evolved and at every stage of his career he has provided such high standard of music. I just hope his confidence stays up so he can continue to deliver such quality. I also wish there was a way to get the word out that people still enjoy his new stuff and want him around! There should be some way to generate mass attention and respect for a man who has contributed so much."
Eminem,3dt08z,BeefySeahorse,8,Sun Jul 19 07:10:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, personally, I acknowledge WHY people don't like his newer content due to the changes. I can adapt to most of his delivery styles, but again, I know why some people would prefer some albums more than others for various reasons. I don't wanna be the guy that just blindly accepts that the song is amazing in every aspect but I'm also not gonna nitpick on the cons and mold my opinion off of that. I mentioned this a million times before in this sub that Em doesn't enunciate his statements so clearly like he used to but he chops them up in insane delivery. Sometimes, I wish he would've said a line more clearly so people can be like, ""He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"" and other times I'm like fuck man he spit this so good, it's eargasmic.   tl;dr: Having constructive criticism is fine, just don't base your opinion of his content off of the cons."
Eminem,3dt08z,BeefySeahorse,6,Sun Jul 19 11:15:42 2015 UTC,"Though that is considered a ""dickride-y"" post, I do agree with a lot of what you said. People are too picky with Em, even a lot of his hardcore fans. It's OK if you don't like something, but he's really trying his best here. He's still killin shit. He's always switching it up, there's always gonna be people complaining or wanting change. We know Em isn't on the same level as he used to be. How the hell do you expect a man to stay in his prime for 16 years. Focus on the positives people! His mind is sharp as shit the way he connects and rhymes words, and he's 42. Appreciate and encourage  Sorry, had to get that off my chest again"
Eminem,3dt08z,Poppin__Fresh,7,Sun Jul 19 05:30:33 2015 UTC,"Respect man, I appreciate your positivity. Personally I'm glad he's switching it up, if he was still releasing stuff identical to MMLP, there would be a lot of people complaining and he wouldn't have maintained or expanded his fan base. Change is necessary and I'd argue he is still in his prime, only his prime now is different to what it was 15 years ago. It was his choice to redirect his music and we should all be grateful that he made that decision."
Eminem,3dt08z,Awhile2,6,Sun Jul 19 05:39:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Sometimes there's songs or parts of his music that are harder to get into, but am I gonna complain? Nah, there's no reason to. Would I like Em back on some smooth flows + Dre beats? Hell yeah. But Em likes to switch it up, and if he's happy and giving it his best, then I'm happy. And I don't really think Marshall is unhappy right now, I just think he's trying to think of something else to do. Usually he ditches ideas himself (Relapse accents) but this time it seems that he's gotten the idea from others to switch it up (I could be wrong). He wasn't really ready to stop being super technical, so now he's just thinking what to do. Like I said, as long as he's happy and goes hard as shit to make the fans happy, I'm happy"

Eminem,3dt08z,baolin21,4,Sun Jul 19 05:24:53 2015 UTC,"You say 'your precious Marshall' as if it's a bad thing. I'm not ashamed to love his music new or old, nor am I embarrassed to look forward to any new releases with the same excitement of his previous albums. He isn't just my precious Marshall, even though the majority of this sub acertain that he has fallen off or isn't what he used to be, you're still here. You're still listening. You still care. If Em was gone, he would leave a massive hole in all our lives, all I'm saying is appreciate that he is filling that void before it's too late."

Do I like every single song he's put out ever? No. But I also don't act like I have any right or knowledge to criticize a man who is arguably the best in the industry. I just enjoy what he puts out, that's what its there for! I got better things to do than argue about his new flow. I respect the man and his art, and that's enough for me to listen to every single thing he puts out and brag about what I do love.

You have no idea how many times I've said things like you have and been told to ""shut the fuck up"". I really don't understand why people complain about him in 2015, have they at all payed attention to the lyrics of Best Friend or Kings Never Die? Those songs are some of his best, and personally, I prefer those two over Lose Yourself (as well as many other songs). If anything, Em is better than he was when he started out. That's just my opinion, but again, thank you so much for making this post. So many people need to ""shut the fuck up"" and be positive for a change."

I have gone to lengths to make posts as long as yours, without a single insult.  In those posts I was describing my feelings on songs in detail and why I personally didn't like them. Every fucking time people just see ""He thinks Eminem should do something different, what an idiot."" Then the comment I spent time thinking out to add to the conversation just gets buried by downvotes.  It's the stans around here that need to seriously jump off his dick and accept while he is still good, not everything he does sounds great.

Eminem,3dt08z,PelosVS,-1,Mon Jul 20 03:24:25 2015 UTC,"I'm one of those weird guys who actually likes his content more now... although i like less of it. If that makes sense.   Eminem creates a lot of VERY mainstream stuff with a lot of very mainstream artists and i can appreciate that, gotta sell some tracks after all, but i'm never huge on those songs. His lyrical prowess still shows, but they aren't as interesting.   While his non-mainstream stuff like Vegas, Speedom, Right for me, Fine line, etc. Shows him at his most lyrically impressive. Which is why i listen to him. I want to see words mashed up and spit out by someone who's a million times smarter than me.   That's why i can't wait for his new album to be released. It'll come out with a few bombastic mainstream tracks with the likes of drake, wayne, rihanna, whatever. But it'll also be released with some of the hardest hitting lyric-centric songs ever and that is what i mostly look forward to.   He's still my favorite artist but look at his song with Drake, kanye, and wayne (Forever). His verse is fucking phenomenal (heh), but the rest are so mediocre and boring (and then there's wayne who sounds like a dying giraffe) that i can't really appreciate the song as a whole and i don't end up getting it or listening to it ever."

MMLP2 was a masterpiece, I generally think the album is kind of overlooked and underrated because of some of the singles Em chose to represent it with. People just listen to The Monster and Berserk and say Em is cheesy and lost it, without even listening and understanding the rest of the album.   Bad Guy, Legacy, Brainless, Groundhog Day are only some of the songs on that album that are just purely amazing. I personally love every song (besides Asshole and The Monster), but ya know, people differ in opinions."

I love the album because I just looked at it realistically and I think others should as well - Slim Shady is just a character now, back on Eminem's first few albums Slim Shady the uber fucked up version of himself.  He's enjoying life now, isn't always angry, and doesn't even need to make albums or tour anymore. He's really not struggling and his job has just been being a dad for a while, plus here's to hoping that he really is clean off any substances. I'd actually like Eminem to stay around for a while so I'm all for the real Slim Shady not coming back.  Aside from that the only song I don't like on the album is Berserk, just feels forced and all over the place for me. Didn't like it as a single and I skip it every time I listen to the album."

Eminem,3drcny,uuumee,6,Sun Jul 19 02:58:22 2015 UTC,"Signles are song which are gonna make the most buzz, get a lot of radio play, a lot of views om vevo and sell a lot on itunes, why? Cause MONEY!  Its not the same for all artists. Lets take Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande for instance (Im not gonna hate on them, they are talented artists, but sellouts.) Artists like Justin Bieber and Ariana and Backstreet Boys back in the day are people whos only purpose is to make money in the industry... I dont think they only get dictated flr singles but the whole album by the record label, the album should fit the likings of around 15 year old teen, why? Because they make the most buzz on the internet, watch and talk about their celebrity gossips and so on, which is a great promotion for artists, sadly a 15 year old teen nowadays needs dumbed down music, because kids seem to be stupid or whatever..  But Em is something total different, while rap was not really popular by white kids (white america) in the late 90s, Eminem, with help of Dre (who was in close relationships with Interscope CEO Jimmy and could guarantee Em more freedom than other artists would get in Interscope.) Somehow outsold every body with at that time not such a popular genre and with not even a bit dumbed down content..  Now 15 years later Em has earned a name for himself because everything he touches turns into a plaque, record sales and money while keeping the contect highly skillful, which otherwise wouldnt work, but Em is Em.  So I can hardly imagine that Interscope knocks on his studio door and starts telling him ehat he should do to get money.. You let the highest selling artist of the decade with so much underground recognition alone and just let him do his shit. Cause hd eill badically outsell the sell outs"
Eminem,3drcny,BLiIxy,5,Sun Jul 19 05:18:13 2015 UTC,95.5 played Desperation for a while when the album came out. I love that song. My group of friends throws it on most of our playlists.

Eminem,3drcny,Poppin__Fresh,4,Sun Jul 19 02:25:33 2015 UTC,"It's interesting, Desperation (or another song that turned into it) was originally going to be the lead single instead of Bezerk.   In February 2013 it was rumoured Eminem would sample Jamie N Commons on the hook of his first single, which was then expected to drop in summer ‘13, preceeding Eminem’s UK-Belgium-France tour with Kendrick Lamar, Earl Sweatshirt, Tyler The Creator and more.  We do not know if Eminem met him on that tour in Britain to record this song. However, this is very possible, since it is the only time they would’ve been at the same place and this hook is not sampled.  Most people argue that he sampled him, but started working on something new (this song) with him when he met him in England. This would explain why there is no first single with a Jamie N Commons sample, they worked out something new and it became this bonus track."

Like 'fuck this, they dont even appreciate my sweat' or something like this..  Honestly just after reading his words it feels like he is letting his spirit down a little bit, like he is thinking that he should just retire before people tear up his legacy with critics.  This shit really bothering him.."
Eminem,3dnw54,BLiIxy,15,Fri Jul 17 21:12:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah. By the lyrics of his most recent songs (Guts over Fear, Kings Never Die, etc.), it's clear that this is how he feels."
Eminem,3dnw54,ActuallyItHasBeen,14,Fri Jul 17 21:31:17 2015 UTC,That's probably exactly how he felt in 2009 when people were saying relapse was whack or in 1997 where people where calling him the Nas copycat. I think it's a good thing. Hopefully it inspires him to put out better music

Eminem,3dnw54,Doshy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:14:35 2015 UTC,"He just talked about faster and complicated. He has the same type of flow even if he raps slower, really doesn't matter.  But what is interesting is that he's talkin' about if he's starting to record for another album, he wants to make sure he approaches it correctly. So he'll probably try to change his sound again for the next album, like he always does."

Eminem,3dnw54,StanlyManly,36,Sat Jul 18 04:43:11 2015 UTC,He recently went online and saw some comments that he didn't like. He's not working on an album because he doesn't know where his career is going. He knows his overcomplicated rhymes aren't enjoyable for the average listener.  Doesn't sound like he's particularly happy right now :(

Eminem,3dnw54,Poppin__Fresh,8,Sat Jul 18 00:50:31 2015 UTC,"It was just too dark and shady, and Em became a completely different person the following year after Relapse's release. He didn't like how evil and immature the album was. At least that's what I think."
Eminem,3dnw54,Poppin__Fresh,2,Fri Jul 17 21:02:44 2015 UTC,I think it's just because it wasn't that good. But people here refuse to look at it from any angle other than it's great and no one appreciates it.

Eminem,3dnw54,MalgraineX,0,Sat Jul 18 22:59:48 2015 UTC,"I loved it because it had incredible flow, minimal wordplay (prefer that than it being overstretched) and good delivery. He rapped a bar, then another one, then another one. Now, he raps a bar then a quarter of the next one, takes a break, raps the other three quarters swiftly and then does in-line breaks in the succeeding bar."
Eminem,3dnw54,SimShade,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:27:06 2015 UTC,"Yeal well that's not as easy as you think it is, you're basically saying you like the Eminem that produced simpler songs than his more complicated flow"
Eminem,3dnw54,BeefySeahorse,3,Sat Jul 18 03:23:45 2015 UTC,"Seems like any constructive criticism gets anyone downvoted on this sub. Everyone just wants to hear that FACK is the most lyrical song ever, even more lyrical than Kendrick's best song. Anyway, I'm actually a huge fan of songs like Right For Me, ShadyXV, Psychopath Killer, etc. but some lines just go unnoticed because they were so quickly delivered instead of saying it slow like he did in other songs (My Name Is, TRSS, etc.)"
Eminem,3dnw54,Poppin__Fresh,10,Sat Jul 18 10:09:05 2015 UTC,"It seems as if Em is just thinking about what to do. He already told us he doesn't have much content to present us with (Guts Over Fear), so he replaced content with lyrical acrobatics and experimentation with flow... Now people seem to be hating on that, so he's reevaluating what to do. I hope he comes up with something.   Damn critics.   EDIT: I'm also gonna add that it sounds like instead of going super lyrical on almost all of the songs he puts out (like he has been, which I enjoyed much of), he's gonna focus on different aspects depending on the song."

Eminem,3dnw54,CobainMyBrains,9,Sun Jul 19 02:49:43 2015 UTC,"I've addressed this before on this sub but I'll be more direct with what I mean by the difference between his old and new flow.   Old:   Hi kids, do you like violence? Wanna see me stick nine inch nails through each one of my eyelids? Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?  New:  HI! [sang] kids do [/sang] you like violence wanna / See me stick [break] nine inch nails through [break] each one of my eyelids? [rapped fast] Wanna copy me and do exactly what I did? [/rapped fast]  The thing is that Em used to spit it slow for these kids so they know that he's talking to 'em. Now, he's still preaching and saying funny ass shit in a lot of his songs but the breaks and pauses are what hinder a lot of people. They can understand the words and what he's saying but they just can't comprehend them because he's rapping instead of talking to the listeners, kinda like the difference between asking a normal person and a guy with a nervous tick how their days were. The former: ""My day was good."" The latter: ""M..my.. My, uh, my day?, Y-yeah.. it uh... It was g-good, my day was good."" I, for one, enjoy the ""choppiness"" as I find his delivery to sound idiosyncratic as it sounds like an instrument in itself instead of just someone rapping. For example, if the beat went boom-boom-clap, he'd make his vocals sound more aggressive when the clap part came."
Eminem,3dnw54,Awhile2,6,Sat Jul 18 09:21:21 2015 UTC,"I agree, this man put his eart, soul and sweat into shit he does and all he gets when he sees the only forum he can is the internet that everyone is dissatisfied. like WTF, respect the mans craft. People who dont like his new stuff cuz they say his new stuff is rehash of old shit, cuz, he says it so? No, he always has something to say, Like The Weeknd, the only time he talks is his music and his ""Rare interviews"". Respect him. BEFORE YOU LOSE HIM."
Eminem,3dnw54,Dphotos,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:17:27 2015 UTC,"it's cool to have an opinion on someone's music but when people just rip him and his music apart it makes me really fucking angry   I hate when people blindly hate on an artist for no reason, but literally every single big name artist deals with this."
Eminem,3dnw54,Cruzader09,21,Sat Jul 18 10:05:14 2015 UTC,I don't know that he's not happy. He's seemed a lot happier lately. I think he wants to try to figure out why people don't like his stuff that he works so hard on. If he spends so much time in the studio then people don't like it. So that's why he wants to figure out what to do next. But that's just speculation on my part
Eminem,3dnw54,CobainMyBrains,2,Sat Jul 18 00:21:15 2015 UTC,"I know this would come off wrong and just unprofessional, but if I was able to speak to him, I would just suggest for him to take a break. He seems like he tries to hard to come up with something new for him to do; and he feels like shit when he doesn't get a good response. If he's constantly in the studio, he'll be more stressed out trying to come up with new ideas; and I feel like like the result of that is some of the music he's been putting out lately, songs that have no substance or meaning behind it. Like honestly Marshall, just go out and take your mind off the negative bullshit and enjoy your life man; and the creativity will come to you.  Edit: a semicolon   Another edit: Just thought it was cool that he listens to Schoolboy."
Eminem,3dnw54,balla21,6,Sat Jul 18 04:34:21 2015 UTC,"All he can do is rap and write. If you think he should take time off, have you considered he doesn't want to. He maybe feels like he took enough time off, and he wants to put his life into this art form. Listen to the southpaw soundtrack so far, its fucking ace if you ask me! I respect shit he puts out. Though I might not like it, i give it a chance, like give it multiple listens and I understand the underlying meaning. I think what he wants to convey is listeners want shit on a silver platter these days rather than listening to a record over and over and trying to understand the substance. Me particularly dont agree with the man himself. He thinks he doesn have much to say, but damn, I listened to MMLP2 for the 500th time tonight and I still found it profoundly intrtiguing as I still find SSLP on the 5000th listen. Like come on. Stop putting the man down. He is too naive. He will do anything yall ask. STOP DEMANDING SO MUCH. HE IS STILL HUMAN"
Eminem,3dnw54,Poppin__Fresh,2,Sat Jul 18 14:25:14 2015 UTC,Do you even listen to Em? Why tf  would he do any of that? Cause he's the type to listen to what others want him to do? Ha. How do you know what he feels like anyway?
Eminem,3dnw54,shamoni,4,Fri Jul 17 20:42:03 2015 UTC,"Because you’re so technically proficient that you can take it to a place where faster and more complicated isn’t always better?  Yeah, that’s what I mean. Sometimes that’s cool, if the song calls for it. But if I end up starting to record for another album, I want to make sure I approach it the right way.   YESSSSS sounds like the next album might do away with the chopper flow."
Eminem,3dnw54,Kool_AidJammer,7,Sat Jul 18 00:18:46 2015 UTC,"One thing that struck me was him admitting that the business side of things isn't really his cup of tea. Did he admit to posing for Beats for free? But it kinda ties in with Shady clothing and the label too. I remember people being mad about how hard it was too find Shady records official merchandise. Also, most groups on Shady Records haven't been very prolific, with Yela already hinting before his second album that he ain't happy. Have we had the second Slaughterhouse album yet? Maybe he needs to step back and look after them as well.  Most of the sun disagrees with me, but one reason I didn't really like MMLP2 is cos of lack of subject matter. I can hear his flows and rhymes are sharp, but I can't care for rhyme schemes when they're not going anywhere. As a rap artist, one of his best qualities during SSLP and MMLP was his story telling which really elevated him from the rest. With the new stuff, there isn't enough matter and that, in my opinion, has been lacking in his music. If I could tell him one thing, that would probably be it. To keep content king, and not the acrobatics. He can use his schemes and stuff if he has something to talk about, but if he doesn't, I personally won't invested in his music as I used to be. He'll just be another rapper, but instead of rapping about cars and jewelry and women, he raps about how on top he is and how hard he is."
Eminem,3dnw54,Luckyluke23,6,Sat Jul 18 04:42:16 2015 UTC,"You hit the nail on the head. He lacks substance now. Yeah, his complex rhyme schemes and rhyming abilities are impressive and at an all time high in his career. But it seems like he's trying too hard to be technical. He has no melody or rhythm in his cadence compared to his older stuff.   Just listen to a record like ""When The Music Stops"" and notice how his timing and flow are so crisp and on beat. His new stuff like ""Phenomenal"" or ""Kings Never Die"" has this weird syncopation and choppiness that makes it sound really off.   Substance and story telling though is the big missing piece. Now days he repeats the same shit over and over. He feels trapped being famous and has girl problems. That's pretty much all he raps about now. That is one of the reasons I think Relapse as an album was so good. He had a theme and a specific subject that he wanted to talk about with drugs and a serial killer type vibe. Yes the accent could be overbearing but he had style and storytelling and still had incredible rhymes and rhyme schemes. A great example is ""Stay Wide Awake"". I really hope Em realizes this soon or he's going to continue to put out mediocre music. At least, mediocre compared to what his usual standard used to be."
Eminem,3dnw54,MalgraineX,3,Sat Jul 18 07:00:54 2015 UTC,"his new flow is ok.. it's just the beat he uses... it's so OFF, either change the flow to match the beat or change the beat"

Eminem,3dnw54,sasukeluffy,5,Sat Jul 18 04:05:20 2015 UTC,I think he doesn't really follow Kanye so when the interviewer brought him up Em was just acknowledging his influence / skill. That's what it sounds like to me.

Eminem,3dnw54,CobainMyBrains,3,Sat Jul 18 22:43:01 2015 UTC,Doesn't address his flow at all.   He says he tries to do what the song calls for.  Most of his new songs with that choppy flow absolutely suffer for it.

He said he doesn't allow swearing in the house and that his kids are getting older, yadda yadda. Now, all the interviewer asked was if they listen to his music and he dodged the whole question. I mean, I know he doesn't want them to be put in the spotlight but I'm sure a question like that is harmless. If they were to ask about their personal lives, like relationships and such, I'd understand. But if they listen to his songs? Harmless."

His attitude, subject matter, even flow, are all too similar to the Slim Shady LP, and its probably intentional, with him idolizing old school Em in his interviews. I mean its one thing to be influenced by an artist, but its another thing to totally copy them. I bet if he found his own original style, he'd be dope as fuck. I haven't to his stuff since Haywire though so I might not be up to date.  But hey, to each his own, he does a great job of being a black slim, and I guess that can be a good thing to some people."

It would be a difficult thing, perhaps impossible, to always be at one's peak barring dying young.

Eminem,3de2zg,ididntsignupforthat,12,Wed Jul 15 20:30:51 2015 UTC,"This is actually pretty clever. As for the commenters who don't agree, consider this:  It's clear the image is a play on Munch's The Scream (1893). There's a few general interpretations from art critics on this painting, and I'm going to list them, along with how it relates to Eminem:   In the 1880s, there was a significant volcanic eruption, which made the sky a deep red/orange color in certain areas for 6 months after. Critics suggest the orange-red sky in the painting reflects that event, as does the screaming figure. This shot of Eminem is taken from his Love the Way You Lie video; he's standing in front of a wall of fire, and is positioned the same as the figure in the painting. I'm sure this was painfully obvious, but I wanted to make clear that the fiery background and emotional figures are reflected the same in the painting and video (and keep in mind Eminem's volcano reference and what it signifies). Other art critics believe that the androgynous, disturbed-looking individual conveys someone suffering from Depersonalization Disorder, which is a mental disorder where a person essentially feels disconnected from his actions, emotions, thoughts, and surroundings. Wikipedia says sufferers ""may feel like an outside observer of their own thoughts or body, and often reports feeling a loss of control over their thoughts or actions."" So knowing that interpretation of The Scream, it seems pretty spot on in a lot of ways when comparing it to Eminem's role in Love the Way You Lie. The last interpretation I'll list has to do with the painting's location and artist. The specific scene and road have been identified, and very close to this spot was a slaughterhouse and an insane asylum (where his sibling was a patient at), which are believed to have inspired the artist for this painting. So, take the aspects of slaughtering, an asylum, insanity, and the separation of a loved one, and you've got yourself the mentality behind most of his lyrics in Love the Way You Lie.   Edit: Literally the most basic scholarly/peer-reviewed research on this painting will reiterate the interpretations I've listed. Numerous art critics and art historians have solid arguments and evidence for each interpretation. I didn't pull this out of thin air and start spewing out random crap about one of the most well-known and analyzed works of art created, and neither did the experts. I'm happy to cite some articles for those who want to read and understand well-respected arguments before acting dismissive and uninformed. After that, I'd love to hear the reasons why my connections to The Scream and Love the Way You Lie is incorrect and a ton of crap."

Eminem,3d4zhl,EndoveProduct,43,Mon Jul 13 15:53:17 2015 UTC,"Doesn't mean he's broke. He filed for bankruptcy just a couple days after being told to pay $5 million. He's just doing whatever he can to avoid giving over $5 million.     He isn't truly bankrupt. Dude owns a lot of assets worth a lot of money, mostly under the names of companies and not necessarily listed under his name. Now he doesn't have to pay off that 5 million. I'm sure after this settles he will cash out some of those assets."

Eminem,3d4zhl,Zars56,8,Mon Jul 13 18:03:20 2015 UTC,he actually keeps a majority of it under other business investments and what not. but you get the general idea
Eminem,3d4zhl,Rogerss93,2,Mon Jul 13 19:12:54 2015 UTC,I can't believe people actually think he's broke.. the dude is worth over $270M
Eminem,3d4zhl,RyanB313,20,Tue Jul 14 09:56:49 2015 UTC,People with this much money don't just have it sitting in their personal bank account. Most of his money is sitting in companies he owns. By filing for bankruptcy he's just avoiding paying Ross's baby mama and maybe some other things. He's far from actually being bankrupt.

You can tell they were more than just a rap group, they were like blood and I'm using the past tense because I noticed this all when Proof was the glue. Slaughterhouse is dope as hell, I think they're all very lyrical and when it comes to making music, they're underdogs. The thing is though is that I feel like they're usually doing their own solo shit and they don't really act like a family, plus you barely ever see that comical chemistry from them that was vivid in D12. I'm not saying that they should always be together whenever they make music, but they should remind people that they are a part of Slaughterhouse instead of individual artists."

Eminem,3cvkv5,gooffy2007,4,Sat Jul 11 16:30:34 2015 UTC,Everyone knows that Em was not relevant or hasn´t got NWA style but I present my two reasons: 1)Em still does big numbers as regards sales 2)He is a huge NWA fan
Eminem,3cvkv5,zetanuevemil,2,Sat Jul 11 18:52:47 2015 UTC,and 3) Dre's involved and Em is usually involved when that happens.
Eminem,3cvkv5,ImShadowbannedAMA,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:02:58 2015 UTC,yeah I forgot about that
Eminem,3cvkv5,zetanuevemil,4,Tue Jul 14 04:22:23 2015 UTC,Eminem has performed with NWA.
Eminem,3cvkv5,RyanB313,4,Sat Jul 11 19:43:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm with Psycho Snail on this one. Eminem being on a NWA track feels like Will Smith putting his son Jayden in a movie: Sure you have the talent to do this, but you don't fit here and the only reason why you're here is because someone really famous and really close to you wants you here.  I love Eminem, but I wouldn't want him on this track...especially a track about Compton."
Eminem,3cvkv5,DarkJokernj,23,Sat Jul 11 09:01:47 2015 UTC,"I see it more in the same light as when eminem had that separate 8 mile Soundtrack full of 50 cent, jay z, nas and rakim to go with the movie."
Eminem,3cvkv5,Philkindred1,0,Sat Jul 11 12:46:04 2015 UTC,Thank you for shutting them up.
Eminem,3cvkv5,Fadic4,6,Sun Jul 12 07:11:06 2015 UTC,"It could be a 2-disc soundtrack, one disc with songs actually used in the film, I.e all the NWA tracks, then a second cd with music inspired by the film."
Eminem,3cvkv5,tqthunder,3,Sat Jul 11 09:13:39 2015 UTC,"That makes it a tad bit okay but I still find it to be not Eminem's place to be on an alternate version of ""Straight out of Compton"" and it goes back to my Will/Jayden analogy; some people will question why is Eminem on the track and they'll just straight up think because of Dr.Dre.   They won't see it as Eminem showing his skills or paying homage to NWA, but as him getting a free pass because ""Papa Dre"" said he could. This is just me thinking, honestly people my just accept it Eminem's presence."
Eminem,3cvkv5,DarkJokernj,3,Sat Jul 11 09:25:53 2015 UTC,"The Pursuit of Happyness is good though, just sayin'."
Eminem,3cvkv5,Kitaoji,3,Sat Jul 11 16:01:38 2015 UTC,"Not many of those artist are still around and you can't ask Eazy to do it.  Your issue is dumb, they obviously want big hip hop artists remixin THEIR songs. You seem to have no issue  with the 28 year old, Kendick Lamar."
Eminem,3cvkv5,Yosonimbored,2,Sat Jul 11 16:48:50 2015 UTC,"Kendrick is also from Compton, and his style and flow is more west coast, where eminems isn't."
Eminem,3cvkv5,Byrdboy,-2,Sat Jul 11 20:00:17 2015 UTC,So that's ok but Eminem isn't? Hypocrite.
Eminem,3cvkv5,Yosonimbored,3,Sat Jul 11 20:17:17 2015 UTC,"Actually he's correct and I think you're just sensitive on the fact that we're feeling iffy about Eminem.  Straight out of Compton is a song with west coast flow, with west coast rappers, and people from Compton. Eminem is none of that but Kendrick is all of that, which is why we're okay with it dude. We love Em, we're just a lil iffy about him being on a track like this...that's all man lol"
Eminem,3cvkv5,DarkJokernj,-2,Sat Jul 11 20:58:54 2015 UTC,"The complaint you agreed with is that Eminem wasn't around during NWA era but saying Kendrick is ok because he's from the west coast, is being a hypocrite.  Neither one of us has an opinion until we hear the song but it's obvious Dre, Ice, Prince, Yella, Ren and probably Eazy if he was alive, all felt Eminem fit with that song."

Eminem,3cvvwc,Psycholemons,-18,Sat Jul 11 05:59:21 2015 UTC,those are really big words there
Eminem,3cvvwc,Psycholemons,5,Sat Jul 11 06:10:17 2015 UTC,I try.
Eminem,3cvvwc,daChals,2,Sat Jul 11 06:46:49 2015 UTC,Recovery is my favourite too but I don't consider it the best.
Eminem,3cvvwc,daChals,-6,Sat Jul 11 07:33:24 2015 UTC,yea the album as gotten me through a lot but eminem wise its ehh
Eminem,3cvvwc,overdosebio,12,Sat Jul 11 07:35:03 2015 UTC,"I don't really think it is eh, it is a good album released at the perfect time and his subject matter (which people only give importance to when he lacks it) is untopable. But what I really like from the album is his clear flow and voice."
Eminem,3cvvwc,TheStreetAlwaysWins,-2,Sat Jul 11 07:46:47 2015 UTC,his shouting flow
Eminem,3cvvwc,overdosebio,9,Sat Jul 11 21:23:36 2015 UTC,"Compared to Recovery, MMLP2 had less puns, less yelling, more intricate wordplay and channeled old school Em here and there. Sure the flow is choppier than Recovery's, but to me, its not that big of an issue to rank it lower.   But i'd still have to go with Relapse, because of Dre and the Bass Brothers, and once you get past the accent, the flow is incredible. I dig the sadistic subject matter, and Beautiful is probably my favorite post-encore era song.   Relapse>MMLP2>Recovery."

Eminem,3cvvwc,Fishpants88,2,Sun Jul 12 08:57:13 2015 UTC,Have you ever sang / rapped out loud with it? The real fun is actually saying all of it. Maybe it only appeals to weird twisted people.
Eminem,3cvvwc,Sir__Walken,13,Thu Jul 16 06:26:22 2015 UTC,Relapse is amazing. I would put it above MMLP2. Just my opinion. What makes you put infinite last?
Eminem,3cvvwc,Sir__Walken,4,Sat Jul 11 05:26:55 2015 UTC,its actually a really solid album but its not Em. I feel like its more of AZ and Nas and lacks original creativity. Its just Em at is earliest stages so he progressed in to better skill and has better albums then that
Eminem,3cvvwc,MrKenAdams,0,Sat Jul 11 05:40:15 2015 UTC,Are you thinking of infinite? I don't think AZ or Nas rapped about fucking a girl with an umbrella and opening it up while it's inside her.   Edit: whoops
Eminem,3cvvwc,Sir__Walken,3,Sat Jul 11 06:00:28 2015 UTC,he asked me about infinite haha defintely not az and nas

Eminem,3cvvwc,kendallfiire,-3,Mon Jul 13 05:14:30 2015 UTC,I feel like it's more of AZ and Nas   Did you have this opinion before the song Guts Over Fear released?
Eminem,3cvvwc,kendallfiire,3,Sun Jul 12 01:45:17 2015 UTC,"Most people did, that's why Em said it."
Eminem,3cvvwc,Ganzi3,2,Sun Jul 12 08:55:26 2015 UTC,yes. very similar to illmatic and some of az songs but if i was back then i would defintely want to make a album like that
Eminem,3cvvwc,kendallfiire,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:18:04 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree. It's just funny how it was worded in your first comment. But Infinite has some of the best rhymes I've ever heard.

Eminem,3cvvwc,Twisted_Lobster,-6,Sun Jul 12 10:46:20 2015 UTC,maybe relapse but recovery nah
Eminem,3cvvwc,Ganzi3,-1,Sat Jul 11 06:50:13 2015 UTC,Actually now that I think of it MMLP2 does have some better songs so yeah I'll let you have this one but I still say Relapse is better.
Eminem,3cvvwc,MrKenAdams,-3,Sat Jul 11 06:59:02 2015 UTC,im saying not only skill and song wise but the overall attraction of the album i say MMLP2 is better because with hip hop fans coming in they would not like the accents and how horror based it is. Thats why i think MMLP2 is great to his collection because it has everything everybody likes. Some pop stuff shady eminem and marshal in all in one album
Eminem,3cvvwc,Xirious,2,Sat Jul 11 07:19:52 2015 UTC,MMLP2 is the best Eminem album.
Eminem,3cvvwc,OWEN626,2,Sat Jul 11 23:43:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it really is. The bonus disc on MMLP 2 is untouchable. Better than the actual album.  But, we are on /r/Relapse practically, so I'm sure this subreddit will disagree."
Eminem,3cvvwc,ActuallyItHasBeen,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:54:20 2015 UTC,is there a place to find the bonus disk online?
Eminem,3cvvwc,dylan96r,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:39:59 2015 UTC,"You tube has it. Just look up MMLP2, the first vid has the bonus as well."
Eminem,3cvvwc,KinkyBuster,0,Tue Jul 14 04:09:04 2015 UTC,I always see people bitching about how people like relapse. All I've seen in this thread about relapse was logical opinions/discussions. Does people having differing opinions on music really bother you?
Eminem,3cvvwc,Mojotoz,2,Sun Jul 12 15:52:04 2015 UTC,"Not really. Personally for me its   1) TES  2) Recovery  3) MMLP  MMLP2 is a dope album, but it's not his best work since TES. I think right now were kinda in a 2003 like era where we arent getting any solo projects but we are getting dope features and shit. I'd say its his best work since Relapse."
Eminem,3cvvwc,Mojotoz,4,Sat Jul 11 16:38:42 2015 UTC,I genuinely don't get how someone could rank Recovery above MMLP.
Eminem,3cvvwc,Youreprobablygay,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:47:45 2015 UTC,Recovery is your second favourite album? Dude what?
Eminem,3cvvwc,haltcitizen,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:22:15 2015 UTC,I agree with your assessment and your title especially. It's not that I didn't enjoy some R&R but MMLP2 just felt like he came back. I also loved ShadyXV so I'm a little different from the sub tho.
Eminem,3cvvwc,PelosVS,-1,Sat Jul 11 06:18:06 2015 UTC,SHADYXV is not a solo tho but i get your point. The beats are better on SHADYXV but the flow is just terrible to my and a lot of others opinion but its your opinion so im not gonna judge. And MMLP2 did feel like that so thats why im excited to see what he can do in the future.
Eminem,3cvvwc,Bayleebgb,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:26:14 2015 UTC,To be honast....i think the mmlp2 was the best  lyriclly.

Eminem,3cvvwc,EndoveProduct,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:08:20 2015 UTC,Infinite always at the bottom of the list and I don't know why. I love that album. It's not his most creative work and he copied Nas but the beats are so chill and it's very relaxing to listen to those songs.
Eminem,3cvvwc,-Swag,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:29:16 2015 UTC,In my opinion Encore was way better.
Eminem,3cvvwc,overdosebio,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:30:52 2015 UTC,"No we definitely don't all agree. I prefer recovery and relapse much over the mmlp2.

It may be nothing but theories are always fun !"
Eminem,3cve23,mriipredator,2,Sat Jul 11 11:31:40 2015 UTC,"I was pondering something similar to that, except my outlook was that it as him telling Em to step away from the game again or else he would fall and ruin everything, as if he's running from this thought of not being on top and mediocre. Which is why he's running away in the video and fighting so hard to not get caught in the trap. I also think Are serves as a sort of Morpheous when Eminem proved he would go to any lengths to survive."

Slim Shady, a ""sequel"" to The Monster, and he has Em trapped in that place with people making sure he stays there so that his guilty conscience can take over but Eminem finally beats his challenges and ends up conquering his alter-ego as he holds the mic.  A symbolization of society telling Em to end his rap career before people call him the biggest laughingstock of rap who can't call it quits, but he's giving them the good ol' middle finger.  The music industry begging him to conform and dumb down his content for the masses to enjoy, but he's resistant so they make challenges for him to hopefully convince him to succumb – which ends up being futile.  Personifying obstacles in life that try to prevent you from your true passion and dream in life, but you overcome them and end up victorious in the end."

Eminem,3cssqe,Quintus26,46,Fri Jul 10 14:09:49 2015 UTC,"Remember when people wanted less ""accents"" and murder talk from the Relapse era? Or when people wanted less ""poppy Eminem"" from the Recovery era? Or less ""guitar/rock"" beats from the MMLP2 era? Or when people wanted less ""choppy flow"" from this era?  Bottom line, NO ONE is EVER happy.  I mean he put out Phenomenal...a track people we're OBSESSED with after only hearing ONE word from it in a god damn trailer, a track where he's even doing his own chorus and singing in it, a very well written track for a BOXING movie and people we're still unhappy with the outcome.  Oh and forgot to mention the fact that people now love relapse after initially HATING IT for the accents that they now miss. I mean holy shit people"
Eminem,3cssqe,EndoveProduct,4,Fri Jul 10 15:16:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's cuz Em's music predominantly lives off of replay value and rapping along to it. You know after the first line in the second verse of The Real Slim Shady, you're not just gonna sit quietly and listen. No, you're gonna be like, ""Well I do, so FUCK him and FUCK you too!"" You listen to Vegas and not a lot of people know all of the lyrics yet. People weren't appreciating Relapse at the time because they weren't used to it, they finally grew into it and now they know what to expect from it. Same thing with Recovery and the ""poppy sound"". Before, I'd be listening to Cinderella Man with my friend and he'd just nod saying, ""This isn't that bad."" A few months ago when I was chilling with him, he was like, ""IF I HAAAD A TIME MACHIIIINE, I'D BEEE.... CINDERELLA MAN--"". That's probably why a lot of people bash on Em's new shit because they refuse to give it another listen mainly due to the initial reaction upon hearing it. Earlier, someone posted something about Kings Never Die sounding a lot better after several listens and it's true because now we're familiarized with it, we know when he's gonna go in the verse, when the hooks are gonna come, when he's gonna sing what line instead of rap it, etc."

Eminem,3cssqe,Qweerz,2,Sat Jul 11 00:01:45 2015 UTC,"This will make me sound like a dickrider but I too admire the choppy flow every now and then. I came to the epiphany that his random grunts go with the drums and the other instrumental components of the song, making the vocals sound more like an instrument themselves.   I guess what the masses want is the flow found in All I Think About (...babeh) and the second half of his verse in Yelawolf's Best Friend (after he says ""--take a fucking hike when I snap cuz I'm a sinner""). A prime example is his Despicable promo freestyle for Recovery. He said one line, paused, said the other line, paused . . . Which is what most MCs do. I'll admit sometimes I wish he'd go back to doing that because it sounds more orthodox. For example, I hate in MMLP2's Desperation with Jamie N Commons, when he says, "" Thought I was pimping cuz I felt like Nas, the first date cuz I gave you power..."" because he says ""Nas, the first"" like it's the end of his sentence but ""the first"" actually goes with the next line and there's not even a double/+ entendre to excuse that.   Though I said I do like his choppy flow, I'm also beginning to understand why a lot of people aren't too fond of it. It's hard to take him seriously when he's rapping like he did in the last verse of Stronger Than I Was. In Hailie's Song, he goes, ""I love my daughter more than life in itself but I got a wife that's determined to make my life living hell."" Had that been in MMLP2, it would've gone like, ""I love my, -grunts- daughter more than -end grunt-, life in ITSELF! But I, got -layered vocals- a wife that's de -end layered vocals- termined, to make my, life LIVING HELL!"" and it just doesn't sound like a normal person venting his anger.   I guess what people really want is him to stay on the beat with no breaks/pauses inside the lines with Dre's production."
Eminem,3cssqe,SimShade,2,Sat Jul 11 00:09:12 2015 UTC,"I've criticized his choppier flow in recent history on this sub but love Kings Never Die. It's an amazing song with an intricate flow, meaningful lyrics and passion in his vocals.   Since SouthPaw music started coming out, I've been listening to the MMLP2 a lot more.  It has grown on me quite a bit and I appreciate it more now than when it first came out.  It is quite a bit different from his previous records in that it shows off his faster speed and complicated wordplay. I think this is Eminem stepping up his game and doing something different to challenge himself. It's better to have him try something different than go stale.  With The Eminem Show, if you've heard the songs a few times and have the lyrics sheet, you can sing along for the most part. Great tracks but nothing too crazy or hard to recite. Hell, I've seen and performed ""Superman"", ""Stan"" and ""The Real Slim Shady"" in Karaoke bars. I wouldn't count on seeing ""Bezerk"" or ""Bad Guy"" there anytime soon.   With people in the past saying he couldn't rap as fast as Tech or his shit was too simple, this is him showing the world otherwise. Em has said on a million occasions that he wants to be known as the undisputed greatest rapper of all time as his legacy. While the new stuff may not be as mainstream, the underground and true rap fans can appreciate what he is offering now.  He doesn't need it to be mainstream either. He's already won more awards and sold more records than anyone else.   I think a lot of the hate came from the lackluster Shady XV. It should have been a mixtape, but it was marketed as a Shady Records Compilation Album. We got mixtape quality tracks, but with Em having such a mainstream appeal and wanting to payout the rest of the labelmates, it's understandable why it was a commercial release.   So I don't think people really hate his flow or new style, perhaps it was a few songs.  Also, I think drastic change can take a while to get used to.   Come to think of it, really all his albums had significantly different sounds from the other and it usually takes people until the next album to start appreciating the last one. This is an unfortunate downside of having your music be ahead of it's time.  ""But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic""  So while I've criticized and joined in on the group hate from time to time, I can appreciate everything he's putting out. He's kept it diverse through the years and is ever evolving. I'm glad I get to be alive during his entire career, as I have a feeling people will be rocking out to it long after we are all dead."
Eminem,3cssqe,Karanastic,2,Sat Jul 11 18:48:46 2015 UTC,Thank you for this. It was eloquently written and an opinion I can respect. I might have also perhaps criticised a few songs here and there with new choppy flow but they grew on me and now I love them.
Eminem,3cssqe,TheElderCouncil,2,Fri Jul 10 19:08:29 2015 UTC,"I like the ""Careful What You Wish For"" reference. They will go back and re-rate. Relapse and Recovery will be classics. The Marshall Mathers LP 2 will be fantastic.  When I ask my generation of Eminem fans, people my age. In their mid-late 20's who listened to him since ""My Name Is"", they all say that they miss the old Eminem. The aggressive flows and the insults to celebrities.  Fast forward 10 years from now, you'll have fans who will say they miss the Relapse/Recovery/MMLP 2 Eminem. I'm guessing the guy will rap until his fossil fuel.  Overall, he's going to have to have one incredible career unmatched by no other when he does retire/die. Let's aim for that second Oscar for Southpaw! Man that will put a giant cherry on top."

It's not bad, I just feel that it had flows at times that were actually totally off, I do not cry about the choppy flow.  And for Kings Never Die, I like everything except for the start of the 2nd verse, as again, the flow there is off.  ""Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer. Wouldn't even take shit into consideration, obliterate anyone in the way""  That is just off, it sounds so weird."

Phenomenal wasn't that great (still a good song, just not to my liking) but All I think about and Kings never die are absolute Mathers gold.   That emotion in this song.

Eminem,3cssqe,007Winner,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:52:54 2015 UTC,"As a fellow Eminem dick-rider, I really tried to think about what it was that I wanted from him.  Even though the SSLP is my favorite album of his, I seriously don't need any more horrorcore.  I'm sure about that.  What I think is taking the most away from Eminem songs at this point is that the beats are very, very complex.  This both emphasizes the background noise instead of Eminem, which makes it hard to appreciate his rhymes, and also (I would assume) makes it harder for his flow to be as consistent.  At heart, Em is still a battle rapper, and grew up on simple, repetitive beats.  All of his best songs IMO have pretty simple beats that make his lyricism and flow stand out.  TL;DR: Em should take a step away from the over the top beats to make music with which he is more comfortable."
Eminem,3cssqe,Awhile2,2,Sun Jul 12 11:30:43 2015 UTC,"what is it you want?    I want Em to choose better beats, better hooks, ditch the choppy flow and focus less on technical rhyme schemes.

What I think though, is that people can't stop comparing it to old sound. As you gotta admit, if a new rapper would make this music, it would be seen as a lot better. But people have Em on such a high pedestal because he already has had a long career, with great music.  I'm not comparing it with his older music, so I can appreciate it. But lets face it, many here and on Hiphopheads etc, have never been truly amazed since he's been back.  While like I said before, I can compare Detroit vs Everybody and Psychopath Killer with his older music, and those songs for me actually beat some strong older music."
Eminem,3cssqe,thuggathugger,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:05:08 2015 UTC,"My theory about Eminem is he blew up during and just after gangster rap. So that's the style he knows and sticks to.

Should have done what Nas and and even Ice Cube did, backed off while he was ahead after TES."

Eminem,3cthvl,SimShade,2,Fri Jul 10 18:03:32 2015 UTC,"Actually, this is a cypher. A cypher is a group of MCs (usually related via group or label) that rap prewritten verses and present their lyrical prowess as best as possible over a simple beat (usually battle rap beats), making it friendly competition amongst one another.   This was the BET Cypher in 2011 (as mentioned by Em in the beginning), he also did one with Mos Def and Black Thought in 2009. Apparently, he hasn't been invited since then (see his verse in Detroit vs. Everybody) but that might be tongue-in-cheek for saying Shady's too crazy to participate in their cypher event."

Eminem,3cc0zc,EndoveProduct,48,Tue Jul 7 17:14:40 2015 UTC,"We need to give credit where credit is due. Recovery came out at the perfect time. Not to mention, its the only album that feels like every single track belongs on it.  Recovery put him back on the map after the immediate hatred of Relapse. Die hard fans loved Relapse, general audiences did not. Die hard fans HATED Recovery, general audiences did not.   It also gave him two MEGA hit singles (Not Afraid and Love The Way You Lie)...LTWYL, for example, was literally always on the radio that summer. It was straight up OVERplayed. But it was exactly what he needed. He needed to make Recovery.  Plus no one can sit there and tell me Cold Wind Blows, Talkin 2 Myself, Going Through Changes, Not Afraid, Seduction, No Love (where he destroys Wayne), 25 to Life, Almost Famous, Session One, Untitled are shit songs, cause they aren't. I'd even throw WTP and Love The Way You Lie in there, they aren't terrible by any means."
Eminem,3cc0zc,redflare20,10,Mon Jul 6 19:17:46 2015 UTC,This is the exact reason why I have always appreciated the album. Not a single person could have said it better than you.

Eminem,3cc0zc,Baby_venomm,2,Tue Jul 7 01:52:03 2015 UTC,"then you're simply a pompous no-body critic if you deny the lyricism, and whose opinion should be taken with a light-hearted chuckle and immediate dismissal."

Eminem,3cc0zc,bendavidi,15,Mon Jul 6 23:20:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it is my favorite album of his. Yes, the MMLP is a classic and The Eminem Show is great to listen to at any time but Recovery just has a special vibe to it.  I just feel Em in recovery throughout, His struggles with losing Proof and dealing with addiction and depression.  His father like image in my eyes is amplified with Recovery.  His other albums are amazing. Lyrically, flows, rhyme schemes and etc. But recovery is my Overall favorite album."
Eminem,3cc0zc,xPierience,7,Mon Jul 6 21:32:10 2015 UTC,Recovery was lit. I fucking loved it. Pure talent. Some don't understand it. Relapse was fucking raw

If we rate them by their best songs I would say the exact opposite order, if we rate them and try to average every song I think your order is pretty good.

Eminem,3cc0zc,MrKenAdams,3,Tue Jul 7 00:17:19 2015 UTC,Shady XV definitely made me appreciate MMLP2 A LOT more than I had. I loved MMLP2 when it first came out but after about 6 months I kinda stopped listening to most of it.
Eminem,3cc0zc,dapuff712,5,Tue Jul 7 04:30:54 2015 UTC,"""A couple years later that shit'll be illmatic"""
Eminem,3cc0zc,dapuff712,2,Tue Jul 7 16:46:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry, auto corrected."
Eminem,3cc0zc,shamoni,-1,Tue Jul 7 17:57:15 2015 UTC,Could someone tell me how many times I gotta re listen to the MMLP2 before I start liking it? I don't seem to like a single song on it.
Eminem,3cc0zc,xPierience,13,Tue Jul 7 18:40:04 2015 UTC,Have you heard Groundhog Day?
Eminem,3cc0zc,eedodeedo007,11,Mon Jul 6 22:07:59 2015 UTC,Or don't front? Or evil twin? Or wicked ways?
Eminem,3cc0zc,joe1134206,12,Mon Jul 6 22:24:29 2015 UTC,"Or asshole, or rap god, or bad guy, or beautiful pain."
Eminem,3cc0zc,thatguytaiv,6,Mon Jul 6 23:48:11 2015 UTC,or....any of the songs...
Eminem,3cc0zc,ActuallyItHasBeen,2,Tue Jul 7 00:07:40 2015 UTC,Or Legacy?
Eminem,3cc0zc,Rushblade,6,Tue Jul 7 06:28:02 2015 UTC,It was my favorite album of his.
Eminem,3cc0zc,ActuallyItHasBeen,4,Wed Jul 8 14:45:04 2015 UTC,"Hey, you're getting downvoted, but I sort of feel you on this.  I've listened to it dozens of times through by now, I'm sure (usually the new Em will stay in my car CD player until the new one comes out, so Shady XV has that spot now), but it doesn't amp me up.  I know Bad Guy is loved around here, but I haven't caught on.  Personally, my favorites are Brainless and So Far--these are just vintage Em to me, but with a modern feel.  Rap God I will always love because it's just him going off.  The rest of the album I just don't feel it.  I'm not going to say they're bad songs (final attempt to ward off my own downvotes), but I personally just don't feel it.   That said, I am very pleased with all 5 bonus tracks.  If those were on the main album, I could be happy.  But the fact that they're on their own disc means my mind will probably never fully associate them when someone just offhandedly mentions MMLP2."
Eminem,3cc0zc,Rushblade,4,Tue Jul 7 00:19:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, if you don't feel it, that's just you man. At least you aren't one of those people that just straight up say it's trash as if it's fact and don't pay it the respect it deserves. I have a very unpopular opinion of ""just not feeling"" MMLP1, but atleast I do know that objectively, it was one of his best."
Eminem,3cc0zc,shamoni,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:28:04 2015 UTC,Exactly my reaction
Eminem,3cc0zc,Youreprobablygay,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:35:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've heard the bonus tracks get.  Thing is, I hear Em and it's cool, right? But you play MMLP and I'm fucking jammng to it, going with the lyrics, having fun with it. Now it feels a bit like it's puns after puns of nothingness. The only way I know one song from the other is through the chorus or the beat. I dunno, I just don't connect to it in any way. If this was the album that introduced me to Em (that the MMLP was), I wouldn't be a fan, I don't think."
Eminem,3cc0zc,EndoveProduct,-2,Tue Jul 7 01:26:37 2015 UTC,"Yup mmlp2 is in my opinion his worst album. I only liked it because it's eminem basically. Couldn't get behind any of the tracks.. At least shady xv was fantastic, and hopefully that will carry over to his next album"
Eminem,3cc0zc,Youreprobablygay,2,Tue Jul 7 07:51:08 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah...bad guy,so much better, brainless, rap god, headlights, love game, legacy, evil twin...just AWFUL songs right?!  /Sarcasm"
Eminem,3cc0zc,jakesboy2,0,Tue Jul 7 13:48:54 2015 UTC,"Nobody said they were awful. Just not his best. And actually the songs u mentioned are all not very good, aside for rap god and evil twin."
Eminem,3cc0zc,thatguytaiv,3,Tue Jul 7 19:41:17 2015 UTC,Legacy is a 10/10 song to be fair

Eminem,3cb4ba,Awhile2,2,Mon Jul 6 15:33:44 2015 UTC,"I don't understand either. It could be these are controlled leaks, or accessing the tracks are very hard for the leakers this time around."

But I switched to Apple Music last week only cause they actually let you combine your non-Apple Music/streamable songs into your library. Whereas with Spotify they had to be separated into 'Local Files'. I hated that. Although I've had some EXTREMELY stupid fucking problems with Apple Music so far. White America, Sing For The Moment, Superman and like 3 other songs from The Eminem Show won't add to my library for no reason at all. Same with a bunch of other songs from different albums and artists."

Superman is one of my favorites off of The Eminem Show. The song just sounds so great and each verse is just really relaxing to listen to. I also love the beat, fits the lyrics perfectly. I also love this song because it shows how Em is free from Kim, but still doesn't like other women. He likes using women for sex, but they try to be more than friends with him, and he doesn't like that. I feel like this song was the beginning of his future misogyny. Definitely his best ""love"" song, along with Stronger Than I Was.    For next week's SOTW, I nominate Kings Never Die."

Eminem,3c0vuc,Bayleebgb,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:30:42 2015 UTC,They could premiere it Sunday night and drop on iTunes at midnight
Eminem,3c0vuc,Bayleebgb,0,Fri Jul 3 20:33:49 2015 UTC,Yeah I just want it on my phone already.

Eminem,3c0ai7,ThatMalteseGuy,60,Fri Jul 3 16:32:36 2015 UTC,"not as much as if he died in 2003, but yeah 100%"
Eminem,3c0ai7,Twisted_Lobster,53,Fri Jul 3 16:40:02 2015 UTC,"Oh god, if Em was shot and killed in 2003, he would be undisputed greatest rapper of all time. He was on SO much hype and status at that time.   I'm not saying he should have, but only IF he did."
Eminem,3c0ai7,BitchImaKillYou,8,Fri Jul 3 18:11:04 2015 UTC,"People would put him about Tupac and Biggie. People would say none of the new rappers were even close to Eminem's level. Instead, a lot of people say he fell off and sucks."
Eminem,3c0ai7,MrKenAdams,2,Sat Jul 4 02:13:31 2015 UTC,straight
Eminem,3c0ai7,Twisted_Lobster,17,Fri Jul 3 20:00:42 2015 UTC,I feel like if he got shot he'd be the next tupac on the spot.
Eminem,3c0ai7,OWEN626,11,Fri Jul 3 16:39:15 2015 UTC,"I agree, the only reason Tupac is prasied so much, is because he died when he was at the peak of his rap career. Who knows what kind of music he would be making I'd he was alive today."
Eminem,3c0ai7,Machan_Shin,3,Fri Jul 3 17:27:12 2015 UTC,Just like kurt cobain
Eminem,3c0ai7,unseine,-1,Fri Jul 3 22:29:55 2015 UTC,"The ""only"" reason? Your 100% wrong there."
Eminem,3c0ai7,Bayleebgb,-8,Fri Jul 3 21:22:56 2015 UTC,I Agree he is praised to much but a lot of his music is amazing just like em but i don't get why biggie is praised so much i can understand Pac but i don't think biggie was that great and only gets praised because he died
Eminem,3c0ai7,FzxH,10,Fri Jul 3 17:33:12 2015 UTC,Biggie doesn't get praised only because he's dead. He has classic albums and was killed during his prime but he is still on of the best regardless.
Eminem,3c0ai7,Bayleebgb,4,Fri Jul 3 17:38:42 2015 UTC,I guess i just never got into him like pac can you name some of his best songs so i can try
Eminem,3c0ai7,FzxH,5,Fri Jul 3 17:40:27 2015 UTC,Really anything off of Ready to Die or Life After Death is really good. If you don't feel like like listening to those then you can just get a greatest hits album for quite a few great songs by him.
Eminem,3c0ai7,koncept61,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:43:34 2015 UTC,Biggies greatest hits album is remastered and altered you have to get the cds
Eminem,3c0ai7,Bayleebgb,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:09:09 2015 UTC,Ok Will Give those albums a few listens and maybe ill really enjoy his music i guess i just thought he always got hyped up to much and never gave him a real shot but i will now Thank You
Eminem,3c0ai7,koncept61,3,Fri Jul 3 17:51:11 2015 UTC,"Biggie is amazing but the reason why tupac is prasied more was because he did way more things, he was in movies, and contributed more. Where Biggie only really just made music. But both are wonderful. Just a little overhyped."
Eminem,3c0ai7,NowYoureDoinTheScarn,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:58:19 2015 UTC,"Tupac had like 3 albums of unreleased content, biggie didn't."
Eminem,3c0ai7,jrdnism,0,Fri Jul 3 22:09:56 2015 UTC,"I'd try gimme the loot, warning, and the title track off of ready to die"
Eminem,3c0ai7,NowYoureDoinTheScarn,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:07:46 2015 UTC,Those were terrible suggestions
Eminem,3c0ai7,unseine,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:44:22 2015 UTC,What are some good ones man? Enlighten me please
Eminem,3c0ai7,overdosebio,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:30:53 2015 UTC,Biggie was waaay on top when he died. I don't think there has ever been a rapper flow as smooth as BIG.
Eminem,3c0ai7,bicyclingdonkey,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:07:51 2015 UTC,big is better than pac. and both are overrated.
Eminem,3c0ai7,garycee,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:18:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, but not completely. Had he died before the release of Encore, definitely. His first 3 albums are highly regarded and had he died after them, people would've talked about the levels he could've reached. However, since then Em has put out stuff that the community has had mixed emotions about that have generally brought him down from his former God tier status. He still has the respect factor, but he isn't making albums like the MMLP anymore, so he's showing he's human too. He won't just make classic after classic like it seems Tupac could've done. We can never know if he would have, but we also can't say for sure that he wouldn't have."
Eminem,3c0ai7,SimShade,13,Sun Jul 5 05:48:37 2015 UTC,"They'll appreciate me when I'm gone  They'll say it was ill, right? The way I killed mics"
Eminem,3c0ai7,mrjantsa,7,Fri Jul 3 19:58:52 2015 UTC,"People are making the same mistake with Em that they did with Michael Jackson (RIP). When MJ was alive, it was ""blegghhh pedo lulz turned wite haha nose sirjeery"". Now that he's gone, they realized they fed into the propaganda too much and saw through it when it was too late. I'm sure if Em were to pass away around 2013-2014, the masses would look past the ""seriousness"" and understand him overcoming a drug addiction that nearly took his life as well as coping with the death of his childhood best friend instigated by the influence of alcohol. Then, everyone will hop on the Em bandwagon and say, ""UGH I wish he was alive I miss him so much :''''(((( he's actually way better than most rappers out there right now"" and all that's posthumous-biased shit that'll irk us real Eminem fans. Sorry, aside from Em, MJ is my idol and my favorite musician of all time (tied with the aforementioned, of course). Sadly, I was one of the many people who realized I was bought into the media's BS after he left this world. Knowing that people would make the same mistake with Em (God forbid) . . . This is something that pops up in my mind a lot especially after hearing the heartfelt words in the last verse of Bad Guy as well as his verse in Take From Me."
Eminem,3c0ai7,Cheerstoshit,11,Sat Jul 4 06:06:21 2015 UTC,Kings never die
Eminem,3c0ai7,B-Bad,5,Fri Jul 3 21:14:03 2015 UTC,"""Why be a king, when you can be a god?"" Contradictions everywhere"
Eminem,3c0ai7,Neemoman,2,Fri Jul 3 23:19:02 2015 UTC,"Had a dream, I was king. I woke up. Still king."
Eminem,3c0ai7,RynB93,6,Sun Jul 5 15:00:10 2015 UTC,"The new fans (new as in post Recovery) maybe. I doubt he'll get new fans over it and I doubt people will like him then if they don't now.  Eminem has always had black and white popularity (no pun intended). Either you like him or not, rarely anybody says they kind of do and if they do they just like ""Lose Yourself"" and two other big time hits.   So if he died, his fans would like him more and everyone else would just be like ""oh bummer."" That's just my prediction anyway."
Eminem,3c0ai7,Abraveliltoaster,5,Fri Jul 3 18:27:12 2015 UTC,"Ya but his legend in terms of how teens and spastics these days shout Tupac as being the best even though they were literally not alive at the time.  Sidenote: he was so good because he was literally like kendrick is now. If kendrick got shot tomorrow people would quote him, and white suburbia (which I'm a oart of) would see hisbposters on their daughter's walls"
Eminem,3c0ai7,jakeometer,3,Fri Jul 3 23:40:36 2015 UTC,"I'd really rather not think about it. I try not to, at least. I won't lie though, the thought has crossed my mind and I do think people would realize what a genius he is more. Let's just appreciate that we have him here now though."
Eminem,3c0ai7,omarTHEDON,3,Fri Jul 3 19:27:02 2015 UTC,"Weird how I have thought about this numerous times. I am glad he wasn't shot dead at the height of his fame, it's his continued relevance that has kept me interested in him. If he wasn't still around I would have left him behind after TES, instead of listening to his music the way I have over the last 5 years. He's the only person who makes music that I think I ""get"" and I get much joy from listening to all of his work old and new. Eminem in death will be just like he is in life, polarizing."
Eminem,3c0ai7,mesutwilshere12,2,Fri Jul 3 21:58:05 2015 UTC,Maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs.
Eminem,3c0ai7,tigerevoke4,2,Sat Jul 4 02:27:41 2015 UTC,I'm a bit of a conspiracy theorist but he outlined in Cinderella Man that the drugs should have killed him in 2005-9. If he releases another political song hes gonna be shot.
Eminem,3c0ai7,mesutwilshere12,5,Fri Jul 3 22:05:55 2015 UTC,By who? And the drugs have nothing to do with anyone trying to kill him. He overdosed and emergency medical services saved him.
Eminem,3c0ai7,tigerevoke4,-3,Fri Jul 3 22:41:04 2015 UTC,Cmon bro. After Mosh and White America he was on the FBI watchlist. He got people to vote Against Bush. He exposed the Iraq war.
Eminem,3c0ai7,lazyrightsactivist,3,Fri Jul 3 22:45:13 2015 UTC,But it would be really obvious if he were killed after releasing a political song. And he has the freedom of speech. More likely they would bother him as much as possible legally (libel and slander charges). They most likely wouldn't win but it's incentive not to write political songs because of legal fees and hassle.
Eminem,3c0ai7,shaun0183,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:50:39 2015 UTC,"I argued in debate class how Eminem will stand the test of time for my midterm final. He has been on so many musical projects showcasing his talent, been in the media as a true to himself man, influenced society greatly on a global scale, and is thele best selling artist at the turn of the millennium.   He's made too big of an impact to not make history."
Eminem,3c0ai7,cccLegacy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:40:49 2015 UTC,yes. It happens to every artist.
Eminem,3c0ai7,Goalchenyuk87,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:58:41 2015 UTC,"Imagine he would be dead after releasing The Eminem Show - he wouldn't be a legend, he would be a symbol. But it's irrelevant cuz he is still amazing as fuck and the best rapper out there. I'm sure if he ""dies"" (hopefully not) his team will still release some shit."
Eminem,3c0ai7,Gl00CoD,0,Sat Jul 4 13:47:11 2015 UTC,"Please, there better not be any Eminem bandwagon fans appreciating his music due to his passing."

Eminem,3bzmuj,dapuff712,17,Fri Jul 3 13:07:30 2015 UTC,Could've sworn at the end he was gonna announce something with Dre as the prod or at least clear his throat at the end like he was about to rap that would've been cool.  All in all cool video.
Eminem,3bzmuj,bla2772,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:39:23 2015 UTC,Silence...then he announces the name of his next album  BOOM
Eminem,3bzmuj,EndoveProduct,21,Fri Jul 3 18:40:02 2015 UTC,BOOM is a terrible name for an Eminem album

Eminem,3bzmuj,EndoveProduct,6,Sat Jul 4 00:02:27 2015 UTC,As an editor though...they REALLY should have timed the video to the beat...atleast a little.
Eminem,3bzmuj,hotdoglatte,6,Sat Jul 4 02:50:50 2015 UTC,"I second and third that. Although not an editor myself, this looks like a very loose last minute job, only 3-4 on the beat cues. nevertheless new Em video - its more than fantastic. I may be wrong but it would have been a lot better if he spit the last verse rapping, like after dropping on stage."

Eminem,3c3ft8,MrUnderstood33,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:20:10 2015 UTC,"Kill you, Kim, Bonnie & Clyde, FACK!"
Eminem,3bx41p,JomamaSeaLion,35,Thu Jul 2 21:40:04 2015 UTC,"The second verse is one of my favorite verses from Em in awhile. Especially the part about twitter pages saying hes been upstaged and ""the death of a renegade"". Makes me think Em is starting to see what people have been saying about him online, which will hopefully motivate him to meet people's (near impossible in some cases) expectations from him. I said this in the other thread but I really hope this song gains a lot of popularity, I really like it."
Eminem,3bx41p,Awhile2,7,Thu Jul 2 21:54:31 2015 UTC,"Completly agree with you my good man! Do you think this song can become a radio hit? Like with ""love the way you lie"" and ""The monster""?"
Eminem,3bx41p,DoubleRomeo,18,Thu Jul 2 22:01:50 2015 UTC,I could see it getting airplay but i cant see it being quite that big. Gwen isnt as relevant as Rihanna as of recent and Kings Never Die isnt quite as poppy as The Monster or LTWYL
Eminem,3bx41p,Awhile2,7,Thu Jul 2 22:14:54 2015 UTC,"I really doubt it, this isn't anywhere near as catchy as those songs. And a big thing Em's music has been lacking lately is relatability. Most people know what it's like to be in a bad relationship, but much fewer people want to listen to him talk about his own career yet again."
Eminem,3bx41p,Poppin__Fresh,4,Fri Jul 3 01:48:51 2015 UTC,I hope so.
Eminem,3bx41p,EUWKillerStyle,10,Thu Jul 2 22:05:20 2015 UTC,"Damn, so far we have three full tracks. Phenomenal, Notorious Thugs and now Kings Never Die. I love all of them. EDIT: This post was made around 4PM PT on July 2, 2015."

Eminem,3bx41p,DoubleRomeo,14,Thu Jul 2 21:52:35 2015 UTC,Blew my mind did not expect that shit.  Best song he's came out with in a while and I didn't expect it wow
Eminem,3bx41p,bla2772,7,Thu Jul 2 22:31:32 2015 UTC,The singing parts just sound sooo good. So satisfying to hear specially combined with the rocky beat and his fast nasal rapping.
Eminem,3bx41p,daChals,6,Fri Jul 3 00:25:10 2015 UTC,"I fucking love this! Eminem should release a song where he does nothing but sing, he's always had a good ear for melody, I know ''Stronger than I was'' was one of em but if he did another like that it'd be fresh"
Eminem,3bx41p,Luverovlotz,6,Fri Jul 3 00:36:05 2015 UTC,"I think i would enjoy that, Eminem can be pretty good at singing"
Eminem,3bx41p,freemypeter,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:41:01 2015 UTC,Stronger than I was is probably my least favorite Eminem song.  I feel like he should have stopped singing after he managed to make Hailies song sound good
Eminem,3bx41p,unlockedswag,14,Fri Jul 3 09:33:09 2015 UTC,This is the first eminem song in awhile that I have really liked. I'm really happy right now just because of this. Eminem my favorite rapper and with his recent output I have really hated and thought that he has fallen off. But this makes me happy and gives me hope.

Eminem,3bx41p,2PointOBoy,0,Fri Jul 3 16:15:26 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly after seconds into that verse on the first listen. It's sometimes mind boggling how the choppy flow is attractive or satisfying for Eminem.
Eminem,3bx41p,Kitaoji,4,Fri Jul 3 02:18:16 2015 UTC,"Damn, I love the sound of that bridge, and I really liked Gwen's chorus also.  I like all verses, but my fav is the 4th verse."

Eminem,3bx41p,MalgraineX,-3,Fri Jul 3 00:48:32 2015 UTC,Honestly it's just wack. All these new songs of his with guitars and drums and rock-like connotations. It's not Eminem I've been listening to for years. His career is going to plummet if all he's going to release are these old man tracks.

Eminem,3bx41p,Buc07,-1,Sat Jul 4 13:50:14 2015 UTC,Doesn't justify this stupid rock phase. Obviously artists vary in what they create as they get older bit maybe it's time to retire like Dre instead of creating shit people don't like.
Eminem,3bx41p,Nonstopas,3,Sat Jul 4 14:32:35 2015 UTC,There are a TON of people who are liking what he's doing right now. Just saying

Eminem,3bxfj2,ThatMalteseGuy,2,Fri Jul 3 16:30:54 2015 UTC,Yeah and to be honest I have enjoyed a lot of the newer Eminem songs.  It's just that at this point I'd wish he would change it up and maybe go a little experimental instead of overusing styles and subjects that he's already been using for a while.

Eminem,3bxfj2,OneMulatto,-14,Fri Jul 3 08:16:54 2015 UTC,"Just sounds like Vegas part two to me, like a leftover track from SHADYXV. Same flow, voice, lyrics, everything. I don't hate it or anything, I actually like it a considerable amount more than Vegas since it's more back and forth as opposed to Vegas's two long-ass verses and I like the beat better but I was hoping Em's delivery would be more like Kings Never Die. Also love how Royce brought up the ""hi Rihanna"" line from the 2.0 BET cypher.  Edit: after listening to it a few times it's grown on me. The first time I was mainly listening to Em's delivery which I still don't like that much but after listening closer to the lyrics there's a lot of really good wordplay coming from Em and Royce in this song."

These track got leaked really early probaly because its just a sound track to a movie all hes studio albumd dont leak till pretty close to the release date."
Eminem,3by896,adamisaacddr,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:40:51 2015 UTC,It happens to all artists. This album in particular is a soundtrack album so it is in the hands of people who maybe would be less careful than the people in control of it had it been a studio album of his. Like the MMLP2 only leaked like a week early. This leaked about a month early.

Eminem,3brwo3,ThatMalteseGuy,9,Wed Jul 1 17:31:47 2015 UTC,"it's over??? that's it??? cant we have a more personal interview, marshall, we miss you :("
Eminem,3brwo3,notyoursoulsister,3,Wed Jul 1 17:34:24 2015 UTC,It was a very short interview lol.
Eminem,3brwo3,RAWD3AL,8,Wed Jul 1 17:37:59 2015 UTC,"It must have been heavily edited because at one point you can hear him say ""We'll just do this for the hour"". That was not an hour."
Eminem,3brwo3,notyoursoulsister,5,Wed Jul 1 17:49:35 2015 UTC,Half of the interview was just him playing music.
Eminem,3brwo3,Twisted_Lobster,3,Wed Jul 1 17:58:09 2015 UTC,"so in essence, that was actually a 15 min interview then"
Eminem,3brwo3,trippystik,6,Wed Jul 1 18:06:13 2015 UTC,The Colbert interview makes up for it 100%
Eminem,3brwo3,SimShade,11,Wed Jul 1 23:20:54 2015 UTC,Very disappointing
Eminem,3brwo3,joedrum2345,6,Wed Jul 1 17:32:06 2015 UTC,"I felt like Zane Lowe kept pushing Em to confirm that he plans on having a movie role someday, albeit Em gave him the indirect ""yes"" by saying if he's passionate about the movie's script then he'll do it.   But yeah, this interview didn't live up to its hype, literally it didn't live long enough."
Eminem,3brwo3,joedrum2345,6,Wed Jul 1 18:23:02 2015 UTC,Was just thinking that.
Eminem,3brwo3,MrPS3skills,2,Wed Jul 1 17:32:16 2015 UTC,At least we got to hear him do some ken kaniff
Eminem,3brwo3,CapitalTactic,2,Wed Jul 1 18:10:08 2015 UTC,best part of the interview
Eminem,3brwo3,Twisted_Lobster,2,Wed Jul 1 18:18:56 2015 UTC,"Apple hyped the shit out of this interview, and I can't stand that Zane has a tendency to play the artist's music during the interview... it's pretty annoying."

Eminem,3brwo3,MrKenAdams,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:39:27 2015 UTC,the best thing about it was when he sang the theme from Rocky.
Eminem,3brwo3,shaun0183,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:45:42 2015 UTC,I watched the Stephen Colbert interview right before this one and well let's just say the Colbert one was a shit ton better.
Eminem,3brwo3,Kitaoji,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:05:14 2015 UTC,ugh zane lowe gotta be the most boring interviewer ever.
Eminem,3bp5vr,ferrarifan,43,Wed Jul 1 00:53:01 2015 UTC,"Slim said a lot of shit in those days just to get a reaction. My favorite was on the SSLP on the track Cum on Everybody when he said:  ""Bought Lauryn Hill's Tape so her kids could starve."" The reason being was, at the time, everybody believed a rumor that a caller started on the Howard Stern radio show that basically said LH would rather her kids starve than have white people buy her albums. It wasn't true - but back in those days - the internet wasn't what it was today - so people just believed she said it. Either way, Em's line was hilarious at the time, and just classic Slim Shady."
Eminem,3bp5vr,Ryno555,22,Wed Jul 1 04:22:36 2015 UTC,Wow I've always wondered about this line and you finally explained it! Thanks man.  Not being sarcastic
Eminem,3bp5vr,Buc07,23,Wed Jul 1 05:45:19 2015 UTC,"He also said ""I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal, so I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauren Hill"".   Role Model."
Eminem,3bp5vr,OneMulatto,17,Wed Jul 1 07:45:47 2015 UTC,For some reason I love that rhyme so much   Store and steal  Lauren Hill
Eminem,3bp5vr,Pogrebnyak,4,Wed Jul 1 09:17:40 2015 UTC,I like how he then rhymes it with ignoring skill and orange bill.
Eminem,3bp5vr,OneMulatto,2,Wed Jul 1 16:28:41 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised that you didn't mention the ""My favorite color is red, like the blood shed, from Kurt Cobain's head after he shot himself dead."" line."
Eminem,3bp5vr,Kinectivity_RBLX,47,Mon Jul 6 09:32:29 2015 UTC,"""Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (bye bye!) Extortion, snorting, supporting abortion Pathological liar, blowing shit out of proportion"" - Just Don't Give a Fuck  In case anyone was wondering."

Eminem,3bp5vr,DudeWithAHighKD,5,Wed Jul 1 23:44:40 2015 UTC,He's talking about pissing off middle age white women.
Eminem,3bp5vr,unseine,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:23:27 2015 UTC,"Well isn't the biggest community that doesn't support it theists and their following has decreased alot since.   But yes, this isn't something you think about today though."
Eminem,3bp5vr,RoadRunnerdn,8,Wed Jul 1 01:47:12 2015 UTC,"It's such a weird topic. Yes most theist don't support it, but I think a lot of other people don't either. It's just the Internet is full of very vocal liberals so I feel like it's thought of as more accepted now. Basically the two sides are people who think killing an unborn baby is wrong and people who think it's the women's choice."
Eminem,3bp5vr,RyanB313,4,Wed Jul 1 02:08:50 2015 UTC,That's such simplistic take.
Eminem,3bp5vr,slim-pickens,0,Wed Jul 1 04:51:26 2015 UTC,To be completely honest I think it should be very simplistic.
Eminem,3bp5vr,RyanB313,5,Wed Jul 1 05:03:14 2015 UTC,You must be in the US because over here in Europe there aren't a lot of people that don't support abortion.   The only people that do are religious people and old people.
Eminem,3bp5vr,q1a2z3x4s5w6,3,Wed Jul 1 08:37:26 2015 UTC,"To be specific, there's people who think fetuses are unborn babies and people who think they're just clumps of cells."

Eminem,3bp5vr,xPierience,-3,Thu Jul 2 00:55:19 2015 UTC,I never really took it like he said that line to be particularly offensive. I just think it rhymed well and described how he felt about abortion. Not every single thing Eminem says is meant to offend.
Eminem,3bp5vr,lennox57,13,Wed Jul 1 05:10:56 2015 UTC,lmao it was obviously to offend people  it was in a song where everything he said was to offend people. lmao
Eminem,3bp5vr,Brainless24,2,Wed Jul 1 06:17:06 2015 UTC,"Literally most of the shit Slim Shady says is to get a reaction. He didn't just say it cause it rhymes. ""Showing emotion"" rhymes in there too but he didnt say that."
Eminem,3bp5vr,MrKenAdams,0,Wed Jul 1 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"He also showed his like for Obama and there's a song about his dislike for Bush.  He is into drugs which is a liberal idea,  and he's obviously pro choice and not a racist tea party type of white guy.  Pretty safe to say em is someone leaning left on politics (I wonder what he thinks of Bernie Sanders)"
Eminem,3bp5vr,acidpaan,-1,Tue Jul 7 04:45:33 2015 UTC,"Supporting abortion and supporting pro-choice movements are the same thing lol. One just sounds nicer than the other, which I understand.  And wether or not eminem means he is supporting killing a fetus or the option for it (which, like I said, is the same thing), both scenarios aren't offensive by today's standards."
Eminem,3bp5vr,elephantangelchild,2,Wed Jul 1 15:22:14 2015 UTC,"They weren't offensive in the 90s either.  Not to the vast majority of people.  Also, liberals and feminists would never find that offensive,  in the 90s, in the 80s, in the 70s, in the 60s, or today.    Also, supporting abortion is not exactly the same thing as being pro-choice. lol."
Eminem,3bqkii,Jrobert94,24,Wed Jul 1 10:08:41 2015 UTC,"No, I love it"
Eminem,3bqkii,BLiIxy,16,Wed Jul 1 10:53:45 2015 UTC,Nope.  An added note: the third verse is definitely one of Em's craziest verses ever in a technical sense.
Eminem,3bqkii,sarcasticgooner,4,Wed Jul 1 12:56:28 2015 UTC,It did when I first listened to it but now I'm used to it and can't imagine the song without it. It adds to the franticness of the song.
Eminem,3bqkii,Qweerz,2,Wed Jul 1 18:32:32 2015 UTC,This is how it was for me after listening to it enough times. At first it was annoying but I could never imagine the song without it.
Eminem,3bqkii,redflare20,3,Thu Jul 2 18:56:19 2015 UTC,Yes it does annoy me.  Everyone on here is of-course going to say they love it.
Eminem,3bqkii,StatuSChecKa,5,Thu Jul 2 15:08:39 2015 UTC,no.
Eminem,3bqkii,Detroitskills,0,Wed Jul 1 11:48:33 2015 UTC,Yup.

Eminem,3bqkii,OneMulatto,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:24:25 2015 UTC,Didn't like that song at all. MY MUSIC BOX.
Eminem,3bqkii,Kinectivity_RBLX,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:33:10 2015 UTC,Oh god yes. The song would be perfect without it.

Eminem,3bqkii,xFreeZeex,-1,Wed Jul 1 13:35:39 2015 UTC,"Not at all, but I find the regular bass kind of annoying as it's too powerful for my taste."
Eminem,3bph5d,RAWD3AL,21,Wed Jul 1 02:38:48 2015 UTC,Can we talk about how happy he looks? He genuinely looks happy. Maybe we should stop all the hating because of his new flow and just be happy that he's happy with what he is doing.
Eminem,3bph5d,Cguercio,9,Wed Jul 1 03:58:31 2015 UTC,"Dr Dre said in an interview from a couple months ago that Em ""Is happy as shit"""
Eminem,3bph5d,Tactial_snail,6,Wed Jul 1 06:42:56 2015 UTC,"He's going back to the way he was in 2009. I guess in 2010, he wanted to get serious for a minute and let people know where he was; 2013, just finally close the chapters and put all of the unanswered questions to a rest. Now, he's back to overkilling it with intense rhyme schemes and icing it with his twisted sense of humor.   In other words, I totally agree... He looks hella happy!"
Eminem,3bph5d,SimShade,2,Wed Jul 1 09:28:40 2015 UTC,I doubt his happiness has anything to do how he flows. I think he's just happy to finally have some serious control over his life.

Eminem,3bo2lv,MrPrecyse,19,Tue Jun 30 19:37:23 2015 UTC,"More movie like video. So not the usual, seeing him just standing there rapping I guess. Could be a cool video."
Eminem,3bo2lv,Kitaoji,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:39:26 2015 UTC,I could be wrong but I think this will be a short film. 7-15 mins. Maybe re familiarizing himself with acting for something bigger?
Eminem,3bo2lv,RAWD3AL,19,Wed Jul 1 15:34:09 2015 UTC,Holy fuck. I really wish Em would get back into acting.   Unfortunately that brings him into dark times. Such a shame.
Eminem,3bo2lv,mikegus15,6,Tue Jun 30 21:00:48 2015 UTC,Just happy to see some new Em footage tbh.
Eminem,3bo2lv,ferrarifan,4,Tue Jun 30 21:14:08 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I was thinking do you think the guy talking to Eminem is a calmed down Slim Shady? its the quote we hear ""Come back"" then when Eminem replies ""If I don't"" he follows with ""you will fall"". He may be talking about Em's career that if he doesn't go back to Slim he will fall off. It may be nothing but theories are always fun !"
Eminem,3bo2lv,mriipredator,3,Wed Jul 1 16:20:36 2015 UTC,should be good
Eminem,3bo2lv,Detroitskills,3,Tue Jun 30 20:02:46 2015 UTC,see phenomenal soundtrack sounds pretty fucking harmonized. some Ppl hating on the song when it was made for solely video and movie purpose.  the background music feels so fucking unique and hyphy in a video.
Eminem,3bo2lv,gogosanta,3,Tue Jun 30 21:50:45 2015 UTC,i would definitely watch a movie if Marshall was the action hero
Eminem,3bo2lv,notyoursoulsister,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:47:07 2015 UTC,He was in negotiations to play the lead in Elysium but the studio didn't want to film in Detroit which was one of his stipulations so they ended up giving it to Matt Damon.
Eminem,3bo2lv,Big_Damn_Hiro,3,Thu Jul 2 11:53:44 2015 UTC,This looks dope as fuck!
Eminem,3bo2lv,Buc07,2,Tue Jun 30 22:58:16 2015 UTC,"Thats fucking amazing.  Also, it seems like the video is gonna be released thrue apple music, if Em sponsors now apple, thatd be dope, would also make apple dominant in music technology business"
Eminem,3bo2lv,BLiIxy,4,Tue Jun 30 19:56:28 2015 UTC,EM sponsors Apple?
Eminem,3bo2lv,Streetwalker-,6,Tue Jun 30 19:58:32 2015 UTC,"Sure looks like it now. The soundtrack album is gonna be released with today launched Apple Music, this film seems like its gonna be released thru Apple Music, he was interviewed by Zane Low who is the new radio host on Apple Music Em also switched his G-shock watch for an Apple smart watch for this film.  Seems like he went with the Doc"
Eminem,3bo2lv,BLiIxy,2,Tue Jun 30 20:15:41 2015 UTC,"Could be a one time deal for the launch of Apple Music, just guessing. He has worn different brands of watches before in certain videos and interviews. Not Afraid is one if i'm not mistaken.  EDIT: Seems like he is back to G-Shock in the Zane Lowe interview, so its safe to say the Apple Watch was only sponsored for the video."
Eminem,3bo2lv,Phouza,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:21:19 2015 UTC,believe he was wearing an apple watch in a pic recently
Eminem,3bo2lv,Detroitskills,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:03:05 2015 UTC,For the curious
Eminem,3bo2lv,easydownloadhelp,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:24:04 2015 UTC,Hes wearing it upside down. Imagine how awkward it is to twist the crown.
Eminem,3bo2lv,RAWD3AL,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:19:17 2015 UTC,Just noticed he is back to a G-Shock in his upcoming interview with Zane Lowe. Seems like a one time sponsor deal.
Eminem,3bo2lv,Phouza,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:07:20 2015 UTC,Im not surprised. there's no way he's going to use an iPhone and apple watch regularly
Eminem,3bo2lv,RAWD3AL,3,Wed Jul 1 13:06:17 2015 UTC,"Em said on Facebook:    Apple Music, you guys will get the first look. ‪#‎Phenomenal‬ coming July 3rd   So like Vevo, the Youtube release will follow, this time after Apple gets their timed exclusive."

Eminem,3bit8h,iiGTOii,3,Tue Jun 30 01:19:28 2015 UTC,Exactly. But people like OP take the slim shady persona seriously and think it's cool to be misogynistic. Pretty sure OP is like 14.
Eminem,3bit8h,ImmaGrownAssPigeon,2,Tue Jun 30 14:50:40 2015 UTC,I think I see what she means by Eminem is an influence. /s
Eminem,3bit8h,_vsrs_,13,Wed Jul 1 00:54:26 2015 UTC,"he doesnt mean what he says.. half the time its a joke or things just to shock/upset people like ""you"" dude has inspiring songs (Lose Yourself, Not Afraid) Amazing music Mention something like the movie thing! that was genius"
Eminem,3bit8h,Brainless24,15,Mon Jun 29 16:30:48 2015 UTC,"To your first point:  ""Shit half the shit I say I just make it up, to make you mad. So kiss my white naked ass."""

Eminem,3bit8h,jrichar31,2,Tue Jun 30 02:04:49 2015 UTC,So basically if this guy doesn't support Em then Em just starts rapin' people. Sounds like the ultimate answer to this dilemma.
Eminem,3bit8h,Legend_wait_for_it,0,Tue Jun 30 02:13:35 2015 UTC,What?

Eminem,3bit8h,Buc07,11,Tue Jun 30 01:32:45 2015 UTC,"If you've started to change your behavior and the way you treat women since listening to Mr. Shady, then perhaps you are too impressionable or young and shouldn't be listening in the first place.   ""Music can alter moods and talk to you, but can it load a gun up for you and cock it too??"
Eminem,3bit8h,Karanastic,2,Mon Jun 29 19:59:49 2015 UTC,"It hasn't changed the way I treat women...I always see women the same as men, except smaller (most of the time), they have vaginas, tits, and are moody once a month. That's it. I have been listening to eminem for a year now, and have always treated women the same as I always have. My sister is going through a phase where she has a fixation that everything is sexist or racist. I say that she shouldn't where a tight skirt out, all of the sudden I'm sexist. I say fat women are ugly, sexist. I say I don't want to date a black woman, I'm racist. I won't date a black woman because of their hair. It is so dry. I'm not attracted to black women, and fat women just like I am not attracted to bangs. She also doesn't realize that they will still find love. A fat woman can date a fat guy, or even a skinny guy, if the guy is attracted to her. Just because I am not attracted to someone, doesn't mean I am insulting them. I just don't want to date them. I have fat friends, and black friends. Just because I don't want to go on a date with them does not mean I am sexist/racist."
Eminem,3bit8h,Karanastic,5,Mon Jun 29 20:20:13 2015 UTC,Your logic is sound young padawan. Your sister sounds overly sensitive and liberal. Listen to some Slum Shady and rock on.

Eminem,3bit8h,ClintRasiert,3,Tue Jun 30 02:17:43 2015 UTC,"You should tell anyone against Em's content to listen to the last verse of My Dad's Gone Crazy, where he confesses that his lyrics are tongue-in-cheek and he'd never let Hailie to listen to his music. Then, you should also tell them in The Real Slim Shady that he says, ""But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope."" Finally, present them the intro of Criminal and explain that it's reminiscent of someone continually accusing you of something that you didn't do, to the point where you're just like, ""Fine, you think I did it? Alright, I did. I'm a bad person, fuck you.""  The double standards in society is really annoying, I agree. You hear Tosh.0 make really controversial jokes and people just ""ooh"" or crack the fuck up. When Em does the same thing, he's protested against. I believe the reason is because ever since songs had lyrics in them, they were either introspective or euphoric – not comical. Thus, it was a new style in the mainstream world that really shocked a lot of people because they thought those were Em's true beliefs. Plus, the reason he delivers his messages in such a ""crude"" manner is due to the world he grew up in. For example, the Eminem protesters in road rage become Eminem – they emulate his raw emotion. The people who go against his content don't understand what he's been through and how convoluted his life was. Imagine domestic violence, altercations, living on welfare, moving to different homes frequently, etc. on top of a lot more specific and fucked up events. It's hard to be all about unicorns and rainbows after living a life like that."

Over here in Germany 90%(scientists say /s) of the decent rap music is constantly displayed as bad in the media, which automatically influences the people that actually still believe in that shit. If you are from America, you are very lucky with your taste in music. Correct me if i'm wrong, but people seem so much more accepting about it. In Germany you better stay quiet if you like rap/hip-hop. Most of the people who don't know anything about it will instantly think you are some kind of maniac and just don't accept it as a genre.  rant over, maybe i could help you. If i had anything snippy that you could tell them, i would help you.

Although, Em's shined the brightest. His rhyme scheme, speed, flow, and everything or anything else was amazing. I remember seeing this one video reviewing the cypher where one of the reviewers stated ""I would call it the song of the year if it had a beat"". I couldn't agree with him more. If this verse was over a nice beat, it would've been amazing and definitely one of the best ""songs"" he's ever done. Em may still have some mediocre songs that have been produced and edited and could have been better than they were, but this cypher proved Em truly is the God he declared himself.

Especially when he rhymed ""nmad saggin"" (which is backwards for something) with the preceding lines, like ""black magnum"". Like always, he went in, does enough to keep your attention and bang.   Joe Budden . . . Alright, if this was a song, he'd be good. But the whole point of a cypher IMO is like a guitar solo, except you're rapping. So using my guitar analogy, it's like he strummed slowly and tried to get you in the feels. In a cypher, you're supposed to exhibit your lyrical prowess.   Yelawolf was really clever but his delivery was way too nonchalant.   Joell is really consistent in general, he continually spits nonstop fiery lyricism and there was no exception in this.   Royce is also very efficient and he did enough to put himself on a high pedestal.   Em sounded sick (literally speaking) but he still sounded sick (figuratively speaking). Halfway in it, I was like, ""Alright man, fuck..."" Beast. If he rapped more like this, stayed on beat, layered his rhyming vocals... That'd sound hot."

I thought this was gonna be an album with Phenomenal and a bunch of instrumental songs from the movie, my hype just turned up to 11 for this soundtrack"
Eminem,3b5ts2,Molerich007,2,Sat Jun 27 03:00:01 2015 UTC,Same I thought he was just dropping one song. Never knew it was going to be an album!!
Eminem,3b5ts2,ChristianMother420,9,Fri Jun 26 05:30:44 2015 UTC,JOEY BADA$$ AND ACTION BRONSON TOO?? IM HYPED SON
Eminem,3b5ts2,sasukeluffy,3,Fri Jun 26 07:09:38 2015 UTC,action bronson is passable but new Bada$$? thanks em I'll have ten of those :)
Eminem,3b5ts2,FzxH,7,Fri Jun 26 05:50:03 2015 UTC,I'm actually really exited/surprised that Logic is on this.
Eminem,3b5ts2,SimShade,14,Fri Jun 26 11:56:19 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm not even gonna give Em crap for working with a Gwen Stefani. Who gives a fuck? Old school Em worked with Missy Elliott back in the day (was getting shit for it too, listen to ""Marshall Mathers""), B.o.B. worked with Taylor Swift. Kendrick worked with Taylor Swift. Chance the Rapper worked with Justin Bieber. This looks like an amazing tracklist. I'm loving it like McDonalds, bitch!"
Eminem,3b5ts2,Shadecraze,4,Fri Jun 26 11:15:18 2015 UTC,"yeah but you see, Eminem almost gained his mainstream fame by dissing pop stars. JUST like Gwen stefani, rihanna etc.. After name-dropping & mini-dissing people like that for such a long time in his career, it's weird. I don't care but you can't put it in with same category as Kendrick, b.o.b etc."
Eminem,3b5ts2,Kitaoji,10,Fri Jun 26 10:39:24 2015 UTC,But he never ever said he hated every pop artist. He made an insanely popular song with Dido.
Eminem,3b5ts2,SimShade,3,Fri Jun 26 15:15:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean, he dissed pop stars but he normally had reasoning behind it. Xtina for example, how she ratted him out on MTV and spread rumors. Who knows? Maybe even to this day, he still probably wouldn't work with her. He hates boy bands and their faux heroic personas so, again, he probably wouldn't work with One Direction. Just because he didn't like the way most of them portrayed themselves as doesn't mean he refused to work with any pop artist."
Eminem,3b5ts2,Kitaoji,6,Fri Jun 26 15:45:45 2015 UTC,"I really only can think of boybands and Britney that he really disliked. Not sure of the reasoning behind Britney. But Christina he actually talked good about, until she talked shit about him. Hell, seeing the interview of them talkin' about eachother, I actually thought back then they would date. But then the beef happened xP.  Maybe it's just a talent thing. I don't think Nsync, Backstreet Boys and Britney are good live. But I actually grew up with that music, and like old music of theirs, even some of Britney's songs. But their voices live... Besides Justin Timberlake really improving."
Eminem,3b5ts2,Awhile2,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:09:25 2015 UTC,he dissed pop stars but he normally had reasoning behind it   i dont know about that. Seems like recently hes been going at anyone with a rhyming name
Eminem,3b5ts2,SimShade,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:29:29 2015 UTC,"True, he usually just goes at random people from like We Made You and up.   The Real Slim Shady: Xtina because she spread a fake rumor and Will Smith because his acceptance speech said (to paraphrase) ""I did this without cussing so this means a lot"" and Em took it as a subliminal against him and Dre.   Without Me: Moby had reasoning behind it, Limp Bizkit cuz of the whole Everlast thing and I believe Chris Kirkpatrick wasn't just randok as well."
Eminem,3b5ts2,RickToy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:06:00 2015 UTC,"Good luck trying to convince a blonde, it's like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out"
Eminem,3b5ts2,Kitaoji,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:19:43 2015 UTC,"Ye, and he also said something about Rihanna before he works with her. He has always put celebrities names in his music. But that is different from how he talked about boybands and Britney.  I'm also not even sure if that was a shot at Gwen.  You could read it as a diss, but you can also read it as him comparing Gwen with himself. Both get said they sold out because they can do different sounds, and why did he have to mention the blonde part? Em is also Blonde."
Eminem,3b5ts2,Rogerss93,4,Fri Jun 26 20:07:10 2015 UTC,I may end up watching this just for the soundtrack
Eminem,3b5ts2,Awhile2,5,Fri Jun 26 20:21:55 2015 UTC,"these songs are likely not going to be in the movie. This isnt the soundtrack, just music inspired by the movie. If anything, Phenomenal will probably be played during the credits."
Eminem,3b5ts2,Rogerss93,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:37:21 2015 UTC,"This isnt the soundtrack   Yes, yes it is."
Eminem,3b5ts2,Awhile2,7,Fri Jun 26 12:31:05 2015 UTC,"No, this is  its like 8 mile, how there is ""music inspired by"" and then the actual soundtrack"
Eminem,3b5ts2,I_have_no_ear,2,Fri Jun 26 12:32:25 2015 UTC,That's the score (instrumental tracks). The songs OP posted are the soundtrack. Some of them will probably only be heard for about 5 seconds when someone in the movie walks into a bar or something like that. It's the same with most movies these days. Take the fast and furious soundtracks for example.
Eminem,3b5ts2,Awhile2,2,Fri Jun 26 12:41:18 2015 UTC,It says Southpaw OST as in Original Sound Track
Eminem,3b5ts2,I_have_no_ear,2,Fri Jun 26 14:48:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah but it's by James Horner (a composer) and it's out on the Sony Classical label. Also, you can tell that the track names are referring to  events in the movie which is typical of track names on scores"
Eminem,3b5ts2,Awhile2,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:34:19 2015 UTC,"I dont get what you're trying to say. It is the movie score, but its still the soundtrack too."
Eminem,3b5ts2,I_have_no_ear,2,Fri Jun 26 15:45:29 2015 UTC,"You said that the link that OP posted isn't the soundtrack and the one you posted is, which is wrong. The one you posted isn't a soundtrack, it's a score and the one OP posted is the soundtrack.   That's what I'm trying to say."
Eminem,3b5ts2,Awhile2,2,Fri Jun 26 16:17:18 2015 UTC,"my bad, youre right. the shady records website is listing it as the soundtrack. Ill still be suprised if more than a few of these tracks make it into the movie though."
Eminem,3b5ts2,dapuff712,3,Fri Jun 26 16:28:21 2015 UTC,"I feel like Kings Never Die will be like Won't Back Down. It's gonna be an intense song with a stereotypical mainstream hook. I might like it if Gwen sings the hook like she did on her song The Great Escape (she sings alright in that). As for the rest of the album, I'm pumped."
Eminem,3b5ts2,air_jordan1,4,Fri Jun 26 16:38:37 2015 UTC,"Holy shit...two Eminem songs, two Bad Meets Evil, Kxng Crooked song, Slaughterhouse, Logic, Joey Badass, etc. I'm really excited for this"
Eminem,3b5ts2,RyanB313,13,Fri Jun 26 12:55:32 2015 UTC,Well I was super excited to see this until I saw that Em used his Tech N9ne verse on a song without him.

Eminem,3b5ts2,Awhile2,2,Fri Jun 26 19:39:50 2015 UTC,"She was a lead singer of the popular late 90's/early 00's band No Doubt. She then had a very successful career as a solo pop act in the 00's. You've likely heard her songs ""Sweet Escape"" or ""Hollaback Girl"""
Eminem,3b5ts2,MexicanMidget,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:40:45 2015 UTC,so whats all the hate about?
Eminem,3b5ts2,Awhile2,3,Fri Jun 26 18:34:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I like her, especially compared to most pop stars. I guess a lot of people are just upset that Em's collaborating with yet another pop star."
Eminem,3b5ts2,Yosonimbored,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:34:45 2015 UTC,Looking forward to the Gwen Stefani colab the most.
Eminem,3b5ts2,Karanastic,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:40:47 2015 UTC,I'm excited to hear some new Bad Meets Evil. Bummed he wasted Tech's verse on a song without Em in it. Speedom was such a disappointment that I was hoping for a proper collab between them.
Eminem,3b5ts2,Jonanarchy,5,Sat Jun 27 17:44:25 2015 UTC,"I'm interested, what did you find disappointing about Speedom?"
Eminem,3b5ts2,Karanastic,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:33:53 2015 UTC,"It was impressive from a technical standpoint without question. Speedom is so choppy and fast that it wasn't enjoyable or something worth repeat listens. For instance, his So Bad song from recovery is a simple and a relatively slow flow compared to his recent stuff. That song is an easy listen and enjoyable as hell."
Eminem,3b5ts2,Awhile2,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:42:41 2015 UTC,"i have a feeling that if Em and Tech did another collab it would still be choppy and technical like Speedom, as is most of Em's recent output"
Eminem,3b5ts2,Pigman232,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:13:54 2015 UTC,Why do people think that Em used his Tech verse on a song without him?
Eminem,3b5ts2,AK47ALI,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:08:03 2015 UTC,Hopefully there is less chopping and more smooth flows
Eminem,3b5ts2,ferrarifan,2,Fri Jun 26 16:59:32 2015 UTC,This will probably be a bust. But no hard feelings.

Eminem,3b5ts2,TGiddy,0,Fri Jun 26 14:41:53 2015 UTC,Yes... I'm just wondering why its on this tracklist is all.

Eminem,3b5ts2,Tacosbob,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:31:38 2015 UTC,"Very true. Phenomenal turned into the deal with Rap God, where I hated it on first/second listen then lived it after I gave it a second chance."

With Em most likely not releasing an album this year, it's strange having just two new songs from him (Phenomenal and ""Kings Never Die"", not including Bad Meets Evil). We'll just have to wait and see. If anything, we'll get the track list or something next week."
Eminem,3b2s84,dapuff712,2,Thu Jun 25 15:39:50 2015 UTC,"Which ones sound cliche to you? Kings never die is the only one that sounds a little off to me but MMLP2 had tracks with names like Rap God, So Much Better, Legacy, and STIW. There could be one or two small errors with this track list, last year the initial SHADYXV track list posted by Amazon had Shit on You listed as a track on disc two which wasn't the case, but for the most part (recently in the cases of Ultraviolence and Reflektor) Amazon France has leaked accurate track lists. Also Em's been busy with Yela's and SH's new projects so only getting four tracks by him isn't all that suprising."

It doesn't sound like it'll fit into a boxing movie. Also, ""Think About"" just kind of sounds strange to me. It may just be me but these sound like titles a dedicated fan tried to come up with to try to convince fans they're real. They are most likely real, but I don't really think it sounds too original."

Eminem,3b5a4u,throwawaymeow43723,21,Fri Jun 26 02:14:10 2015 UTC,You do realize that nowadays it's only cool to dislike Eminem.
Eminem,3b5a4u,MrKenAdams,14,Fri Jun 26 04:14:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, disliking Em and praising J. Cole / Kendrick is the new cool. Not to take anything away from them, but it is what it is."

Eminem,3b5a4u,barelyblurred,-8,Fri Jun 26 18:16:17 2015 UTC,Not really.. Let's compare Good Kid Maad city to MMLP2 shall we? Any reasonable person will tell you GKMC blows mmlp2 out of the water any day. I can feel the downvotes already from delusional Eminem fans.

Eminem,3b5a4u,109876ers,39,Sun Jun 28 03:44:37 2015 UTC,his most recent albums haven't been well received.    Stopped caring at that. MMLP2 is one of his highest rated albums.
Eminem,3b5a4u,dylan96r,16,Fri Jun 26 02:34:57 2015 UTC,It had four top 20 hits too
Eminem,3b5a4u,Awhile2,21,Fri Jun 26 02:41:49 2015 UTC,Yeah I honestly don't understand when people say Em is not relevant when he still sells more than any rapper.
Eminem,3b5a4u,dylan96r,15,Fri Jun 26 02:48:34 2015 UTC,"People are always saying ""oh he sells his new records off of nostalgia and the fame he had before."" Ok, that argument becomes invalid once you realize his last solo albums and singles repeatedly charted, and will continue to chart, near the top.  I think people just like to dislike him"
Eminem,3b5a4u,BeefySeahorse,4,Fri Jun 26 02:59:13 2015 UTC,He still sells more than most artist.
Eminem,3b5a4u,dapuff712,10,Fri Jun 26 03:10:54 2015 UTC,He's sold more than any other hip hop artist.
Eminem,3b5a4u,Poppin__Fresh,-2,Fri Jun 26 03:17:31 2015 UTC,That's because he's been an artist for longer than almost everyone else.

Eminem,3b5a4u,xovertime22x,2,Fri Jun 26 21:16:17 2015 UTC,So fuckin true.
Eminem,3b5a4u,Poppin__Fresh,-8,Sat Jun 27 03:09:54 2015 UTC,Em hasn't been the biggest selling rapper for a few years now.
Eminem,3b5a4u,defaultsubsarebad,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:37:40 2015 UTC,Can you provide sources for that?
Eminem,3b5a4u,Poppin__Fresh,-1,Fri Jun 26 13:59:33 2015 UTC,MMLP2 got a pretty mixed reception. It's not a bad album but saying he hasn't had a well received album in a while is 100% true.
Eminem,3b5a4u,Travisthederp,3,Fri Jun 26 04:37:07 2015 UTC,Reasoning? It had like a 74 on Metacritic last time I checked and I hear almost universal positive feelings towards it all the time.
Eminem,3b5a4u,dylan96r,3,Fri Jun 26 06:57:43 2015 UTC,"There were only like two mixed reviews on Metacritic. One was Pitchfork, which is the most pretentious hipster site I've ever encountered. I can't remember the other one."
Eminem,3b5a4u,omarTHEDON,15,Fri Jun 26 20:12:25 2015 UTC,"His lyrics are also rife with misogyny and homophobia, which makes him a pretty poor person to hand a microphone that's broadcasting worldwide.    That journalism though."
Eminem,3b5a4u,xovertime22x,0,Fri Jun 26 03:08:13 2015 UTC,You do realize the majority of the time any celebrity comes off as liking everyone its because of pr. Right?  Eminem has always lived by the freedom of his speech.    You have every right to not be into his music or his message.  But to say he's a poor person to give the mic to is Ludacris.
Eminem,3b5a4u,SimShade,8,Sat Jun 27 03:14:17 2015 UTC,"Not too long ago, The Verge reviewed the old Google Photos app thinking it was the new one, pretty much calling it ""mediocre"" and ""the same thing"". Which is irrelevant but it shows that they really have little to no value."
Eminem,3b5a4u,RyanB313,6,Fri Jun 26 05:19:58 2015 UTC,"Eminen has already explained his use of homophobic lyrics, such a horribly thought out article."
Eminem,3b5a4u,thetanpecan,2,Fri Jun 26 05:42:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I am a lesbian and a huge fan of his... He disses literally everyone in his lyrics, he doesn't focus just on gay people...  It would be different if he did.  That's like when he talks about killing people, and how dumb kids take it seriously, not realizing they're just lyrics to his songs."
Eminem,3b5a4u,thesynking,4,Sun Jun 28 18:03:08 2015 UTC,"As soon as I read the shit about his 'misogynistic' and 'homophobic' lyrics, the motivation for this article became incredibly transparent. It's true he's not as big as he was, but they tried to paint him as a washed up has-been, so dishonest."
Eminem,3b5a4u,EricOrsbon,3,Fri Jun 26 16:43:27 2015 UTC,"He alos won two Diamond awards from the RIAA for selling 10M+ songs for Love the Way You Lie and Not Afraid.  And didn't he win a Grammy for MMLP2?  And how many Eminem fans want to hear Eminem explain his use of fag or faggot?  Yeah, who wants to hear Zane grill Em about that?"
Eminem,3b5a4u,Cartmanhatesme,3,Fri Jun 26 03:09:56 2015 UTC,"Even if the author doesn't think he's as popular now as in the past, that's like saying don't interview Michael Jordan because hey, he's no longer playing basketball. People often have interesting things to say once they are no longer in their prime. Sometimes more interesting."
Eminem,3b5a4u,Streetwalker-,2,Fri Jun 26 04:53:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, obviously he's not as big as he once was.  But, just because he doesn't have the macro impact he once had, doesn't mean people can't recognize a genius."

Eminem,3aep9r,Ccino,2,Sat Jun 20 07:38:43 2015 UTC,"When I clicked the ""kick ass vocals"" I was hoping for live, 'cause she's kinda bad live. And you compared her with Christina who is actually amazing live xD.  As for the 2nd link, I believe that is edited."
Eminem,3aep9r,Kitaoji,0,Sun Jun 21 06:18:00 2015 UTC,"From personal preference,  I don't listen to anyone live. I believe a big part of 'live performance'  is to be there in person with the crowd and the energy. Listening to it at home just seems like lesser quality for no gain imo.   That being said, I also don't believe subtle studio editing subtracts from the core quality of someone's voice. It may be glamed up a little, but you can still tell she's an excellent vocalist."
Eminem,3aep9r,Ccino,2,Sun Jun 21 06:40:50 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is, that I've listened to a lot of live from her, and I haven't found 1 where I was really thinking she's good vocally. But the Jolene cover she is good. Which is a backyard session uploaded to an official page, and those are almost always edited.  I'm not saying she's horrible btw, she just isn't really that great live, the Jolene is better than her other lives. These official page lives are always much better for every artist.  And comparing with Christina is just going overboard."

Eminem,3af4sj,dapuff712,19,Fri Jun 19 16:55:17 2015 UTC,"We still have over a full month until the movie comes out, I wouldn't classify that as ""right around the corner"".  Edit: I might as well share my thoughts on the song while I'm here and before I get down voted for sharing a thought that makes complete sense.   Phenomenal is a great song, the use of Em's choppy flow in this is definitely easy and fun to listen to. The rhymes in this song are also amazing. For example, the line where Em states ""I right with the left, the same hand I hold the mic with, as I fight to the death..."" that line just gives me goosebumps. I also really enjoy the end of the second verse, as it just feels so intense. I listen to this song while jogging and it feels great. Hope the rest of the album is like this song.  Edit Edit: For next week's SOTW, I nominate the CXVPHER verse (if possible)."
Eminem,3af4sj,dapuff712,2,Fri Jun 19 16:57:33 2015 UTC,"Depends how you look at it, they've been working on it since atleast december 2010 (DreamWorks acquired the film in december), probably longer. With that in mind I think it's fair to say its right around the corner ;)."
Eminem,3af4sj,EndoveProduct,3,Fri Jun 19 17:02:58 2015 UTC,"Really? 2010? I thought it's been in development since 2013. Wow, that's a lot. Also, almost everyone in this sub would curse me out for saying what I said up there, I'm glad someone on here is civil. Thanks for pointing this out to me though, I had no idea it's been in development for that long. I now see that it is right around the corner ;)"
Eminem,3af4sj,SimShade,14,Fri Jun 19 17:06:19 2015 UTC,"Was pumped after only hearing one line of the song in the first Southpaw trailer. Full song didn't disappoint either. I'm a big fan.  People need to realize this is a song made for a BOXING movie. And with that in mind, he NAILED it. The beat alone was the best part of the southpaw trailer. It FIT"
Eminem,3af4sj,Qweerz,3,Fri Jun 19 17:50:23 2015 UTC,"I love it for the most part but there are parts that can be better. Gonna break down the whole song and give it my CC [constructive criticism (not really bc I love it)]:  Delivery: Eminem's? Top notch, incredible. The hook is fawking amazing, I wish he'd sing more hooks like that which was common from TES - Relapse.  I love his rhythm at the end of the first verse, ""willing to go uncharted / feeling is so bomb / feeling myself I'm"" . . . The whole ninini NAH, absolutely dope. That part was kinda similar to the whole construction of The Way I Am. The whole song is delivered well, I loved the way he spat his cypher verse last year since it just flowed so greatly. Liz Rodrigues tho? She sounds sick. Like, not as in ""good"" sick... Literally, like she has a cold. It sounds like she's forcing herself to say ""find"" in the bridge. Another problem with the bridge is the way she says ""emotion"" – maybe something to do the way it was transmitted into the song? I don't know. Point is, it has the same problem as the hook in Space Bound. When that guy sings, ""I'm a space bound rocketship and your heart's the moon"", it does not sound like ""moon"". I swear, that dude had a fucking Freudian slip and said ""more"". Listen to that shit on your headphones. Getting back to this song though, she says ""emotion"" like ""emurrson"". That small thing irks me a bit. It seems like these flawless post-hiatus songs (Twisted, STIW, etc.) gotta have these minor piss offs in them. For example, Twisted has the unflowing ""She really don't give aaaaa..."" and STIW has Em grunting in the background.   Lyrics: Beastly done. They're just like his ShadyXV lyrics... Machine-like rhymes and intense wordplay. If you converted his brain to a chess player, he'd probably hit you with the insanest (insanest ain't enough a word, you stupid fuck) moves tbh.   Message: Uplifting and BROAD. That's what I fucking love. The way that it can relate to anyone. Well, at least the first two verses, but the third verse is motivational. It's what's been lacking from Em for a while... To spit a meaningful message not directly about him.   Production: Really nice but won't blow any production-heads out of the water.   tl;dr: Phenomenal is PHENOMENAL...nal...nal...nal."
Eminem,3af4sj,SimShade,2,Sat Jun 20 10:11:18 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem with Space Bound's hook. Whoever sings that sounds 100% congested in the nasal cavities. Also, the tl;dr would be ""Phenomenal...nomenal...nomenal...nomenal..."""

I still think it could be so much better if the flow stayed the same instead of changing every verse, and I hope the soundtrack has some more amazing songs.  For next weeks song I nominate Nuttin' To Do"
Eminem,3af4sj,slimtotheshady,2,Fri Jun 19 19:58:19 2015 UTC,"I love this song. Struck a chord with me on the first listen and only got better. It riddles me sometimes exactly how much our opinions differ but thats the way music is I guess. I cant listen to Survival for example, but I see many people absolutely love that song. Is weird to me that someone sits down and listens phenomenal and is left with a indifferent ""meh"" but hey, thats what some people think when I cannot endure Survival.  edit: magad, just realized I typed Survival but I ment Legacy.

Eminem,3af4sj,Awhile2,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:47:38 2015 UTC,It took me a minute to get into this track.  But once Em starts begins his flow everything falls into place.  The only thing I can fault him with throughout his career is a questionable beat selection.
Eminem,3af4sj,creativebic,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:18:17 2015 UTC,"to be completely honest, i hadnt listened to the song since the week it came out. There was nothing to it that made me want to come back and listen to it again. Im giving it a second shot right now and it hasnt grown on me. Dont get me wrong, there are some cool parts to the song, I especially like the last few bars of the first verse and the cypress hill line, but for the most part when Im listening to it i just feel like im waiting for it to end. It just doesnt hold my interest. I think its partly due to how repetitive the beat is and partly due to how generic a good portion of the lyrics are."

Eminem,3abdru,RyanB313,-1,Thu Jun 18 20:10:03 2015 UTC,"I found the album mostly just mainstream music that was kind of... girly maybe? I don't know, it felt a bit too mainstream and all those songs where he collabs with a bunch of modern rappers like Lil Wayne were just super obnoxious... eminem killed it and lil wayne sounded like a dying giraffe like he always does, ruins the song.   Apart from that, i did like a decent amount of songs on the album, just significantly less than his other albums."
Eminem,3abdru,Bigmethod,5,Fri Jun 19 17:27:37 2015 UTC,"I think I'm a bit more open to his newer stuff because I wasn't really old enough to be a big fan when he was blowing up initially. I absolutly love MMLP, TES, SSLP, and Infinite, but I just like how he's been mixing it up. Sure maybe Recovery isn't as lyrically great as his older music, but it's refreshing and a great change of pace in my opinion."

MMLP2 is the one album i got around 90% of his songs on my ipod, which is really really rare since i'm incredibly picky about my music. (Most non-eminem albums get 2-3 songs, honestly)  What's strange is that the runner up is actually relapse with The Eminem Show tying it."

I was in my teens during eminems hype years and recovery is still a fantastic album to me.. Mmlp2 on the other hand was not so fantastic but at least he recovered with shady xv"
Eminem,3abdru,Youreprobablygay,2,Tue Jun 23 23:17:34 2015 UTC,"Listen to Lil Wayne's mixtapes, or basically anything he put out between 2004-2008. I promise you, he used to be good."

Eminem,3abdru,Travisthederp,0,Fri Jun 26 07:11:44 2015 UTC,"Dude, i spend like 5 hours a week looking into his lyrics, haha, i love them. However, in recovery it was more love-story stuff that really wasn't as interesting as his other songs. Ie. Bad guy, etc."
Eminem,3abdru,Bigmethod,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:35:26 2015 UTC,I was referring to the Lil Wayne Part. You shitted on him for his Voice when lyrically his verse was really badass imo. I think you passed it on unfairly :p
Eminem,3abdru,Travisthederp,2,Fri Jun 26 22:06:09 2015 UTC,"I just relistened... i don't think the lyrics are that great... and his flow is just nonexistant. He literally referenced smoking weed randomly, ""be good be good at it?"" what. I just don't really like anything about it."

Eminem,3abdru,mattkward,19,Fri Jun 19 09:45:27 2015 UTC,"I mean we got Cold Wind Blows, Talking 2 Myself, Going Through Changes, Not Afraid, Seduction, No Love (where Em obliterates Wayne), 25 to Life, So Bad, Almost Famous and Untitled. All terrific tracks. I'd even throw in Love the way you lie in the pile...it's far from absolute shit. Even WTP is awesome.  I love Recovery...minus Won't Back Down and You're Never Over of course."
Eminem,3abdru,EndoveProduct,24,Thu Jun 18 20:23:12 2015 UTC,"You don't like You're Never Over? For shame. So many incredible lines in the second verse, which is 2 straight minutes of badass."
Eminem,3abdru,MimicHat,6,Thu Jun 18 21:14:18 2015 UTC,It just didn't work for me. The singing is truly truly awful. I don't think I've listened to the song in its entirety in years.
Eminem,3abdru,EndoveProduct,5,Thu Jun 18 22:03:26 2015 UTC,Same. It's a shame because the verses are good but the hook is unbearable
Eminem,3abdru,Awhile2,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:56:09 2015 UTC,Look at you getting down voted for having an opinion. Fucking Reddit lol   I agree completely. I enjoy his second verse. But It's just an all around...average song with horrendous chorus. Which is a shame. Especially since it's about proof.
Eminem,3abdru,EndoveProduct,2,Fri Jun 19 03:46:14 2015 UTC,It's not Reddit... Just this sub

Eminem,3abdru,fcumbadass,2,Fri Jun 19 00:26:43 2015 UTC,"I agree, I love when em's verse comes in.  I feel like every song he's on with lil wayne has a building up point to his verse.  I also feel he's subliminally shitting on lil wayne, but that's a whole other story.   (Maybe not just lil wayne, but all younger rappers who he may have once, during his temporary downfall, felt insecure about).    It's like he knows they're good so he doesn't outright shit on them, but he's making sure they know their place.    ""Yeah that rap was tight, but I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um..."""

Eminem,3abdru,Rawdreago,2,Thu Jun 18 21:22:10 2015 UTC,"Lol I feel the same exact way song for song. Those 2 r the only ones I skip.  Sometimes I leave them on because the lyrics themselves r good but idk compared to the rest of the album it's like ehh.  Absolutely love 25 to life, going through changes and talkin to myself, those r my top 3.  I get chills still like he takes the unthought words right outta ur head."
Eminem,3abdru,ChristieLadram,4,Fri Jun 19 06:57:07 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand why people hate the album for being different. 25 to life, for example, is pure eminem and it's REALLY good"

Em was at the forefront of all the new music I would find out I loved in the hip hop genre and this album is what made me love Em. Recovery will always have a special place in my heart.

Eminem,3a3bzu,kingkoons,4,Wed Jun 17 02:23:58 2015 UTC,Yeah but Tech can be overrated these days and Em can be underrated. we just wont know til it's released.
Eminem,3a3bzu,user1444,-2,Wed Jun 17 03:32:24 2015 UTC,"True enough, I'll give you that.   However, the last Eminem song I was truly impressed with the ""flow"" on, was, I cannot even say anymore.  I think one of the leaked tracks, or one of the slower, calmer ones from MMLP2.   To me, anyways, when it comes down to a ""speed off"" like this, it doesn't matter how fast you can rap, if your verse is filled with awkward pauses and forced, choppy rhymes for the line's sake.  It matters how good it actually sounds at that speed.  Eminem just hasn't sounded good for a while when he tries to go that fast.  Even rap god, which was great for the most part, suffered from this new flow he has adapted ever since that 4 person song with lil wayne years ago, with macadamia nuts, it was the first time I ever felt, like not bobbing my head along with his rhymes.  He has kept it up ever since too.."
Eminem,3a3bzu,kingkoons,5,Wed Jun 17 03:39:02 2015 UTC,"yeah i know it sounds a little choppy at times, but that is Tech's style too. he literally calls himself a 'chopper'. he does it and he does it a lot better and more fluid and natural sounding, but the only reason we get upset at Eminem, is because we have seen how good he is with a nice flow and intricate rhymes before and now he is trying something new and we hate it. there is no winning with fans these days because half of them are, to quote Rap God, 'stuck in 2004'.  EDIT: This may be a little off topic but upon reading your reply i realized a few things, such as Tech doing what Em  has started doing, and people loving Tech over Em, and that that might be because of our high expectations of him because of his past discography."
Eminem,3a3bzu,Poppin__Fresh,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:45:27 2015 UTC,I think the difference is that Tech is a chopper through and through. Em has just picked it up recently and is still growing into the style.

Eminem,3a3bzu,user1444,-2,Wed Jun 17 17:56:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know about 2004, I'm still ""stuck"" in the 90's man.  Not even stuck there, it's just... Listen to forgot about dre, for a great example, that is fucking amazing, literally ahead of it's time.  A person cannot compare that to rap god and say, ""yeah, rap god did what it was trying to do, better then forgot about dre did.""    Why can't he be delivering that solidly on all front's anymore, rhymes, flow, speed, delivery, the fucking intonation of his words?    Well, he isn't young and hungry anymore, granted, I shouldn't expect him to be THAT good, given the context between then and now.  However, if this choppy stuff is just the way it is now, and you have to get into it, or don't, I just can't do it."
Eminem,3a3bzu,kingkoons,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:56:03 2015 UTC,"Your right. but the stuff he was doing back around that time was so good, his first  3 albums were enough to put him on any and every top 5 list for the rest of time. it was too good because now, Em is stuck. people want him to do stuff that is nearly impossible to recreate without fucking it up, and pissing people off more. so now he's trying new techniques. i think if he is seriously considering staying in the game for a few more years, we will see him experiment with his flow, style, speed, and lyrics. i understand the hate for the new flow, just don't write him off because of it. try to look past it."

Eminem,3a2j48,spikecastle,8,Tue Jun 16 18:49:13 2015 UTC,"The asshole at the bottom who said, ""I didn't want to listen because you were in [the song]"" and who is completely unaware of his own foolishness had me grinning."
Eminem,3a0hf3,notyoursoulsister,3,Tue Jun 16 07:04:31 2015 UTC,"He said in a TRL interview years ago that he was interested in acting and the movie business. Makes sense, this way we can continue to get awesome Em tracks without the expectation of groundbreaking new stories or epics because they aren't his studio releases"
Eminem,3a0hf3,RynB93,2,Tue Jun 16 13:30:20 2015 UTC,He was asked to play in the Elysium movie as the lead role but he refused because he never fucking leaves Detroit
Eminem,3a0hf3,Shadecraze,3,Tue Jun 16 15:16:04 2015 UTC,He wanted it filmed there and they said no so he said no too
Eminem,3a0hf3,RynB93,5,Tue Jun 16 18:19:10 2015 UTC,"Em getting busy in the studio, what an workaholic, no signs of slowing down."
Eminem,3a0wnv,HunterReddeh,4,Tue Jun 16 10:38:14 2015 UTC,Obie delivered but that beat is kinda boring and repetitive. Hoping we get an Em feature on his album  Edit: nvm. Track list is out w/ no Em feature
Eminem,3a0wnv,Awhile2,3,Tue Jun 16 12:00:01 2015 UTC,I don't think Em and Obie would have good chemistu anymore anyway with Ems new delivery.
Eminem,3a0wnv,air_jordan1,2,Tue Jun 16 12:51:45 2015 UTC,"Obie's back! This is definitely a new sound for him, not sure how I feel about it. His flow is definitely dope, the beat feels a little like something I'd hear from B.o.B, a little boring but not terrible. The hook is fucking stupid. Obie is a new artist and I can see this going in a good direction"
Eminem,3a0wnv,B-Bad,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:01:15 2015 UTC,a new artist? Fucking 12 years ago he released Cheers
Eminem,3a0wnv,air_jordan1,3,Tue Jun 16 20:06:42 2015 UTC,"I meant he has reinvented himself as a new artist, with a new sound. My bad for being unclear"
Eminem,3a0wnv,B-Bad,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:07:18 2015 UTC,"Yea, I thought you meant something like that"
Eminem,3a0wnv,BLiIxy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:31:45 2015 UTC,Album 'The Hangover' release date: 7/8
Eminem,3a0wnv,Bigmethod,0,Tue Jun 16 11:19:39 2015 UTC,"All i'm hearing is a bunch of newschool... really really boring IMO. The lyrics are slow and i feel like I've heard it all before. The beat even moreso. I really can't stand this mainstream stuff... ironic since Em is my favorite rapper, but i feel like he's the only exception i can find.   Hopefully the rest of the album has some more down to earth lyricism."
Eminem,39zzj3,iiGTOii,21,Tue Jun 16 03:52:00 2015 UTC,That mix was.... meh. But at least Treyarc has good music taste. It's also nice that more people may be finding out about Yelawolf :)
Eminem,39zzj3,Pigman232,14,Tue Jun 16 05:47:11 2015 UTC,they really know how to butch a song dont they?
Eminem,39zzj3,joedrum2345,13,Tue Jun 16 04:07:48 2015 UTC,"I know, didnt like the mix either but its cool that yela is getting this type of recognition"
Eminem,39zzj3,zerocontrole,3,Tue Jun 16 04:17:26 2015 UTC,butchering stuff is prety mutch activisons job.
Eminem,39zzj3,Detroitskills,2,Tue Jun 16 13:14:47 2015 UTC,"""oh u want waw2? here have shitty jumping characters and lasers""   activision motto"
Eminem,39zzj3,zerocontrole,3,Tue Jun 16 19:04:01 2015 UTC,"to be fair, we realy needed more shitty jumping characters and laser games."

Eminem,39zzj3,Clockwrrk22,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:08:41 2015 UTC,Who the fuck wants waw2? The black ops series is way better and more popular among fans.
Eminem,39zzj3,Detroitskills,2,Fri Jun 19 21:02:25 2015 UTC,"alot more ppl than you would expect want an older shooter again, you can oly go so far into the future dude lol"
Eminem,39zzj3,dylan96r,7,Fri Jun 19 21:28:33 2015 UTC,"I bet Activision has some sort of contract with Shady Records because so many COD game trailers use Eminem songs, and now it uses Yela."
Eminem,39zzj3,jm__,3,Tue Jun 16 15:09:04 2015 UTC,"I liked the remix, not amazing but still decent."
Eminem,39zzj3,shaun0183,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:09:20 2015 UTC,wtf is that? survival was nice but this didn't seem to fit the feel of the  trailer at all.
Eminem,39zzj3,neb120,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:13:02 2015 UTC,Guarantee this was part of the deal when they managed to get Em on board for the last one. Em would only do it on the condition that they agreed to use Shady Records artists for music in the future
Eminem,39zzj3,blowjobburglar,2,Tue Jun 16 07:52:35 2015 UTC,I don't believe there was a trailer for the CoD out now with a Shady artist.
Eminem,39zzj3,zerocontrole,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:57:59 2015 UTC,"no his comment doesn't make sense, eminem did a couple trailers for cod games in the past tough. he seems to be their go-to artist."
Eminem,39zzj3,pussyonapedestal,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:16:42 2015 UTC,He did won't back down for black ops and survival for ghosts
Eminem,39zzj3,zerocontrole,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:30:58 2015 UTC,and till i colapse was used for the mw2 trailer.
Eminem,39zzj3,pussyonapedestal,2,Wed Jun 17 17:46:28 2015 UTC,yeah i guess he's their go to because (i won't sugarcoat it) em appeals to all the little 13 year olds that play cod
Eminem,39zzj3,zerocontrole,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:49:00 2015 UTC,"yeh that is exacly how i saw it, i just did not mention it."
