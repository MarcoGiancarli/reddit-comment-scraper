Grew up poor enough to have electricity cut for weeks at a time, though. My father taught himself Visual Basic from books he got at the library, and got a job programming until starting his own one-man software development company. My mother cleaned people's houses and took up cutting hair until after a few years had opened her own salon. It took over 20 years for my parents to work off their debt but at no point did they need any sort of outside assistance.  Meanwhile, African nations receive billions in foreign aide, tonnes and tonnes of food airlifted in constantly for a generation, and massive support for building education and industry.  Other struggling countries don't seem so effected.  India was colonized ruthlessly by the British and heavily exploited. Today it is as bad off as most of Africa, but they have booming industries, growing scientific and technological advancement, and an education system that is among the most challenging in the world. At least India is trying, and the people are making a difference despite living in squalor."
